(OUTLOOK andREVIEW
Practicality and the EC

Idealism grounded in reality is a wonderful concept, fot

 

through it we may improve our condition. Idealistic proposals
having little or no practical basis, however can develop into
constructions bearing little resemblance to the original idea.

Keeping this in mind, the members of the Executive Com
mittee should be lauded on their rejection of a propo a: to
set aside $5 of each student's comprehensive activities fee for
that student to designate for spending as he wishes.

Without even considering the increased paperwork and
administrative hassles such a plan would entail, the so-called
doubtless have been encumbered

“$5 check-off plan” would

with a plethora of troubles. A large portion of student fund

would have been suspended from the working budget for some

months, and ruthless campaigning for funds by established

committees would have been inevitable.

\pparent lack of interest in the proposal on the part of!
the student body would have subverted the original aim, that
being to get students involved in the budgetary process and
have them designate areas where they feel further monetar;
aid is required. The highly visible standing committees would

check-off, conceivably

have received the lion’s share of any
ending up with a larger budget than originally requested from
the EC,

Students interested in organizing a new club would have
been forced to canvass the student body to find support and
sufficient numbers of undesignated five dollar bills, Once

The load of work the EC would have saddled itself with 1

incredible. Not only would it have had to listen to exist
societies’ proposals, but it would have had to sit down and sort
out the truely valid small projec rom the really hairbrained

schemes that may have been submitted, The clerical work in

volved in keeping track of who had designated his $5 and who

had not would also have kept the EC secretary on his toes.

The idealism behind the proposal may be justifiable—giy

ing some of the power of the purse back to the student. But
that would have been pried open by in
plementation of this

2 THE RING-TUM PHI

 

   

OUTLOOK andREVIEW.

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Of purse strings...

The budget for 1975-76, as reported on the first page, was
voted on by the Executive Committee in a special session last
Thursday evening. Although a second vote has to be taken,
it can be assumed that the budget as it now stands will be
ratified.

Standing committees’ requests were pared from $54,049.44
to $48,320.00. The requests for funding made by other groups
were denied and the groups were advised to seek aid from the
new Executive Committee Funding account. EC Funding,
in the amount of $4,500, will be used to handle special requests
that may be made during the year by various organizations
or individuals. It will accomplish approximately the same
ends as the ill-fated Five Dollar Proposal in a much simpler,
more expedient manner,

It is interesting to note that the Executive Committee
allotted roughly a $500 increase for its own operating budget.
Last year’s EC overspent its budget by about fifty per cent—
while that group used some of its funds to finance small re-
quests, requests that will now fall under the EC Funding
plan, the overrun of $800 on a planned budget of $1500 was
substantial. With the segregation of special funding requests
into a separate account, we hope that the current EC will
monitor its own finances as closely as its members plan to
monitor the expenditures made by other organizations. Par-
ticularly in light of the increase it gave itself, the EC should
spend its monies judiciously so as to avoid charges of padding
its own budget at other committees’ expense.

.. and parties

While we are on the subject of budgets: we were distress-
ed to note the death of banquets provided for in the budgets
submitted for approval. In particular, the Publications Board
Banquet and the fete always thrown by the Executive Com-
mittee in honor of itself (and justifiably so) are sorely lacking
in this year’s budgets. Only last year the Senior Banquet met
its demise, and now two of the few remaining pat-oneself-
on- the-back affairs have joined the ranks of the late and great.

Washington and Lee, the haven of the Gentleman's C in
academics and A in socializing, is rapidly being transformed
into a campus whose calendar is devoid of any banquets to
recognize those (but admittedly not all of those) who inject
into this university much of their time and effort to provide
a congenial atmosphere in which one may leisurely pursue
a bachelor’s or juris doctor's degree.

Inflation constitutes the bulk of the increase in this year’s
budget, and thus “frivolous” and “wasteful” banquets were
among the first items to be stricken from the list. Ah, the
Age of Extravagance is gone forever, and the Age of Thrift
has usurped its place.

Restraint

The perennial problem of unauthorized townspeople using
University facilities and attending “closed” parties is again
plaguing various facility administrators and fraternity offi-
cials. Specifically, usage of the tennis courts, the University
Center, and admission to combo parties are the areas of
concern at the moment.

Regarding the tennis courts, on which space is competed
for by W&L, VMI, and citizens of Lexington, Coach Miller
is having signs printed which explain the University’s policy
and order of precedence, which hopefully will alleviate the
arguments concerning rights to use the courts.

In the University Center the main problem is with children
roaming free, occasionally damaging furniture and generally
causing trouble, Here students are asked to firmly but tact-
fully request that unauthorized persons leave. (Townspeople
have the right to use the Cockpit, but no other facilities are
available to them.) In most cases the juvenile trespassers will
leave with little persuasion—in infrequent imstances a more
imposing authority figure may have to be summoned to
remedy the situation.

The stickist problem concerns combo parties at fraternity
houses. In recent weeks there have been petty
larceny, damage to property, and an outbreak of violence in at
least one instance. Extreme care in choosing one’s words and
a high degree of tact are needed in situations where non-
fraternity members are making nuisances of themselvs.

A majority of the time there is no trouble between towns-
folk and fraternity members, and the presence of outsiders
is not intrusive, But there are occassional troublemakers who

CAaSCS of

are doing nothing but increasing the animosity between mem
hers of the University and members of the community,

We ask that uninvited persons who are making themselves
unwanted be politely but firmly asked to leave. Do not be
unreasonable or condescending in tone when requesting that
they depart, for they too are only there to enjoy the party.
Students frequently comment that they are somewhat appre
hensive to ask townspeople to leave, fearing retaliation later i
the evening. To this we must reply that most people are
rational beings, and if asked in a polite and gentlemanly fash
ion they will respond similarly,

Most of those who have been showing up at combo parties
are just people looking for a good time, not for a fight. For
the sake of promoting amicable relations between the Uni
versity and Lexington, we urge restraint in dealing with situa

tions of this type.

Noell on Honor

The following is an edited tran-
script of comments by Dean William
1. Noell Jv., coordinator of the
freshman year, describing the Honor
System at Washington and Lee Uni-
versily,

The Honor System—or at least the
concept of honor—has been operative
at Washington and Lee at least since

General Lee’s time, Most of us, I
think, have tended to characterize
the System as one which — says,

essentially, that an honorable man
doesn't lie; he doesn't cheat; he
doesn't steal, No one means to suggest
by that that this simple formula-
tion of the Honor System is the be-
all and the end-all in the sense that
this is all the Honor System might
comprehend,

I have long felt that one of the
enduring strengths of the System
is the fact that the administration of
the System is entirely in the hands
of the students, ‘There is simply no
way in which members of the faculty
or administration become involved,
except to the extent that they may
be called upon to report a suspect-
ed violation, After that, however,
the to whether or not
particular conduct does in faet con-
travene the spirit of the Honor
System is left entirely to students,
Phere is no way the faculty or mem-
bers of the administration can over-
ride that decision...

decision as

I know that Honor Systems are
not in vogue any more; a number
are collapsing; a number are the

subject of legal challenge. TP've often
asked myself why Washington and
Lee's continues to be strong, or at
least as strong as I think it is, 1
suspect I've already suggested one

reason, and that is the extent to
Which we trust students to operate
it, so that some change in values
and some change in mores are
constantly reflected in the judgments
that students make. It’s not a system
that is imposed from the outside,
by “us” on “them.” They are the
ones who make it operate; they are
the ones who make the critical
judgments,

But 1 suspect as well that there
is a second reason why our System
is strong: the size of the Washington
and Lee student body . is such
that a sense of community can, and
does, exist. We have students largely

with shared values, to whom the
concept of personal integrity and
honor is important, It’s probably

difficult in’ a larger environment to
create that sense of shared purpose,
that sense of togetherness, that sense
of the importance of integrity.

Ask Traveller

 

Confused, naive girl: “What's all that noise coming from that fraternity

house?”
‘Traveller: “That's what

is called the

Rite of Rush. [It occurs every year

about this time, It is analagous to the coming of the locusts, for it
brings to the campus a flood of females, a flood of beer, and above all
a flood of confusion on the part of the freshman class,”

Girl, after venturing inside the house: “What is al Ithat shouting going on,
and why is that guy with the card on getting a can of beer shoved
down his thoat, while everybody yells CHUG Tt, CHUG, CHUG,
CHUG?! Are they imitating a train or something?”

‘Traveller: “No, that’s what is called pledging, and it involves paying about
$25 a month to get your body bruised and battered by a bunch of
people rather cuphemistically called brothers.”

Slightly less naive girl: “Why is that crummy band playing “Jungle Boogie”
five times in a row, while a bunch of delirious people jump up and

down like a band of Zulu: warriors?”

‘Traveller: “That's what is called a combo, and is mainly attended by
outrageously drunk people who seem to try to get as much beer spilled
on the floor as they get in their mouth, [It is also attended by a strange
beast called a gatorer who does a strange dance called gatoring, which
sometimes causes dates to flee W&L with looks of disgust and horror on

their innocent, naive faces.”

Informed girl “Well, it does a great job of mopping the floor!”

A deli in Old Main ?
Hot pastrami on rye

By JAY MeCANN

One is inclined to locate a Lex-
ington Deli somewhere — between
Third and Park Avenues, and one

hardly expects to find such an eatery
in Lexington, Virginia. But thanks to
Jerry Darrell, the Commons Czar,
the town of Lexington does, indeed,
have a delicatessen, albeit mas-
querading as “The Old Main Sand-
wich Shoppe.”

Phat the name “Sandwich Shoppe”

over the more concen-
tional “Delicatessen” should come as
no surprise; the natives have lately
shown an infatuation with — the
affectedly colonial, To sell portraits
of the Pope in Lexington they might
have to be labelled “Harry Truman
in Full Masonic Regalia,’ or so the
jokes goes. To promote a deli, it
might have to be called a “Sand-
wich Shoppe,” but “a rose by any
other name ef cetera.”

Bruce Springsteen: new Dylan?

 

Zappa returns to conventional

By JOHN JACKLEY

Born to Run

I suppose I too should join the
common cry and proclaim Bruce
Springsteen as the new rock star of
the Seventies, destined to dominate
rock for the foreseeable future while
reaching new heights of artistic
achievement. Well . he's receiv-
ing a lot of hype from Columbia
Records, but somehow it just doesn't
succeed, Born To Run is his third
album and although not a bad LP
(i wouldn't leave a room if some-
one put it on their stereo), it hardly
qualifies him as the next Dylan.

Enough of the conceptual biases,
For those who admire Bruce Spring-
steen, Born To Run is a milestone
in his career, Springsteen rises above
the cult level—although widespread—
and finally reaches appeal in the
mass audience, He does this with-
out changing his style to accom:
modate commercial tastes, and suc:
ceeds in retaining his original follow-
ers along with the more recently
converted devotees.

Most of his songs are about New
Jersey street life, and “Born To Run”
is no exception, “We ride through
mansions of glory in suicide ma-
chines’ of a “runaway American
Dream”; it reminds me of street
prophets bearing signs: youre never
quite sure whether to believe them
matter how good they
But “Born To Run,” the first
cut on side two, is a topseller on
many charts, and sounds like his best
yet.

He's accompanied on Born To Run
by the E Street Shutlle Band, who
could probably make it on their own
despite Rolling Stone's description
as “the great American rock and roll
band )-a Neil Young/Stray Gators
or Dylan and the Band? Clarence
Clemons is outstanding on saxephone,
and on “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out’,
Michacl Brecker on tenor sax and
Dave Sanborn on baritone sax are

equally talented. Randy Brecker is
also excellent on the trumpet in
“Meeting Across the River.” Springs-
teen does the guitars and vocals,
Garry ‘Tallent does the bass, and Max
Weinburg is on drums,

\ll in all, the album is passable
if you've never heard him before,
good if you were vaguely aquainted
with him, and superb if you're really
into Bruce Springteen, His is de-
finitely an acquired taste. Music, like
just about everything else, is ulti-
mately subjective; the same follows
for vock stars.

One Size Fits All

One of the most polarizing artists
today is Frank Zappa. No one is
moderate on Zappa; he's either re-
vered or reviled, a genius or a de-
generate. It's all in your conception
of human nature... One Sire Fits
il is a major turning point in
Zappa's music, A significant change
is the new emphasis on his guitar,
the new perspective of Zappa as the
central core of the album, In previ-
ous works—Weasels Ripped My Flesh,
We're Only In It For The Money,

bizarre sound creations; Zappa did

“get out of my mind,

“Pajama People’ is unique in
another respect. Zappa's lead guitar

reach mass appeal in a few more
albums (and thus probably open to
more charges of commercialism),

Zappa was born in Baltimore, but
seems to have been weaned from his
khakis and topsiders at an early age.
He reportedly admires Edgar Varese,
a contemporary classical composer.
Zappa originally wanted to do a
single twenty-volume set of albums,
but was discouraged by his record
company. He does most of his
recordings in his basement studio,
and refrains from the use of all
drugs. He has two children, Dweasle
and Moonunit (honest).

His theory holds that music is all
along one continuum, that all mo-
tion is musical motion, generated
around one single note, On the tech-
nical side, he can imitate CSNY,
Hendrix, jazz, blues; nothing — is
beyond his whim, In One Sie Fits
All, he discards the puppets and
bursts in a distinctive style, hope-
fully incomplete, and sure to move
in new and better directions,

The Generals met the Cavaliers of
the University of Virginia last Thurs-

WRKL fell to the Cavs, 5-0. Virfinia re-
peatedly applied presure on the Gen-
eral’s defense, as the home team fin-
ished with a 19-8 shooting advantage,

WRKL fell behind 2-0 after five
minutes and then attacked the Wa-
hoo goal while displaying good pass-
and control, But the Generals
couldn't dent the nets and a third
UVA goal before halftime added to
a lead which was never theatened.

In the second half hard rains slow-

time. Maleolm Hastings, in

and came up with seven saves.

the defeat,

The Generals hustled and played

There is no doubt about it —
Washington and Lee has absoutely
no luck when it comes to playing
football. For the second week in a
row the Generals have seen oppor-
tunities for victory go for nought.
This time, against Centre College, a
late fourth guarter rally brought the
Generals close but a missed extra
point and a 35-yard field goal at-
tempt that was wide to the left
ruined their victory hopes. As a
result, the Generals had to settle for
a 9-9 tie bringing the season record
to 0-1-1,

The Generals got on the score-
board first late in the opening period,
After the defense stopped Centre on
a fourth and one situation, W&L
took over on their own 30 yard line.
Krom there, a run by Jack Berry and
passes to Mark George and Tony
Perry brought the Generals down to
the Centre 9 yard line, A costly
fumble on second and goal and an
incomplete third down pass, which
was called pass interference and then
overuled, prevented a touchdown, On
fourth and goal with 4:18 remaining
Dan Thompson kicked a 35-yard field
goal giving the Generals a 3-0 lead.

‘The second quarter was unpro
ductive for W&L as the offense failed
to move the ball. Berry was off target,
missing on four passes, The running
game also slacked off, Rich Moncure
was the only W&L runner to gain
any substantial yardage, rushing 6
times for 20 yards, The Generals got
only one first down while Bruce
Howard was forced to punt four
times.

O

Centre theatened the entire second
quarter but did not succeed until
the final four minutes, Quarterback
Richard Riney passed to Mark Davis
twice for a total of 34 yards bring-
ing the Colonels down to the W&L
15 yard line. Failing to get the first
down with time running out in the
half, Centre went for a field goal.
The attempt by Jim Akin was good
but Centre was penalized for illegal
procedure and they had to try it
again, Then on third and 13, Akin’s
35-yard kick went straight through
the uprights just beating the buzzer
ending the second half. Halftime
score: W&L 3-Centre 3.

The Generals came close to scoring
carly in the third period after Berry
passes to Mark George and Richard
Wiles put W&L on the Centre 14
yard line. Failing to get a_ first
down, W&L went for a field goal.
Ihe snap from center bounced be-
fore reaching holder Rocky Joyner
and Dan Thompson was forced to
run. A Colonel defender dropped
him on the 25 yard line for an 11
yard loss and Centre took over first
and 10,

Phe third quarter was scoreless
until the final 2 minutes. Centre took

line after

over on their 24° yard
holding W&L on a fourth and 13
play, On second and 7 from the

Centre 46, Riney hit tight end Dan
Young with a pass. W&L defender
Charlie Brown tried in vain to
break it up but Young eluded him
and scampered 54 yards for the I IY.
Akin’s extra point attempt was no
good and W&L trailed 9-3.

deadlock with Centre

The final score came late in the
fourth quarter, Jack Berry spurred
the General attack passing to Mark
George and Richard Wiles for first
downs. Runs by Berry and Ed John-
son brought W&L to the Centre 7
yard line. On first and goal with 2:07
remaining, Berry hit spohomore Bob
Szczecinski with a pass for the TD.
The extra point attempt that fol-
lowed was unsuccessful as Rich
Moncure, attempting a run, was
stopped short of the goal.

The second opportunity for the
Generals came with 12 seconds left
in the game. Dan ‘Thompson at-
tempted a 35 yard field goal but the
kick was wide to the left and the
final score stood: W&L 9-Centre 9. It
was a hard fought contest and W&L
deserved to win—too bad Centre
didn’t see it that way.

Harriers split
in 3-way meet

Sheperdstown College was a_ piece
of cake for both Washington and
Lee and Davis & Elkins, but in the
long run D&E’s meal tickets lasted
slightly longer as the Generals failed
to conjure up any last second miracles
and were forced into second place
in last Saturday's cross country meet
in Shepherdstown, W. Va.

Both the Generals and D&E proved
to be rude houseguests indeed by
humiliating Shepherdstown by scores
of 15-42 and 15-45 respectively. The

match’s outcome easily may have
gone in the General's favor had it
not been for D®&E’s first class

thoroughbred, John Magee, who took
top honors in the meet with a 24:51
time in the 4.75 mile run, Magee’s
closest. pursuer, W&L's Tem Wash-
ington, finished 37 second later, lit-
erally light years in cross country,

The General's 25-30 loss to Davis
and Elkins was disappointing but
certainly not disgraceful, Neverthe-
less, the five point conquest did give
D&E a shot of confidence which
could prove to be considerable factor
in future encounters, General coach
Dick Miller appears to be calm and
unruffled and is busy preparing his
troops for this Saturday's showdown
at V.M.1. against the  cross-town
rival Keydets. Other schools compet-
ing in the upcoming event will be
Hampton Institute, Norfolk State
and Roanoke.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Thursday, October 9, 1975

In the defense
of Tradition

Last week there was a conference of student leaders and
deans of area colleges at the Peaks of Otter. Washington and
Lee sent four representatives to the gathering; cach return-
ed with the conviction that although the University is not
Without its faults, it is coping with its problems better than
most colleges in the vicinity.

A recurring theme which manifested itself in the most un-
likely of moments was retrenchment. By that we mean a re-
turn to values and standards abandoned in yesteryear. This
movement to retrench is not coming from faculties or admini-
strations, but from student bodies.

Some examples of the phenomenon can easily be cited.
There is a definite trend among students everywhere to once
again center their collegiate lives around the campus, with a
concurrent increase in demand for dormitories and other on-
campus facilities.

Another tendency brought up in discussion was the stu-
dent preference for strengthened rather than loosened distri-
bution or core requirements. It seems that of late many stu-
dents have discovered, much to their chagrin, that they are
being graduated from self-proclaimed liberal arts colleges with
something less than liberal arts educations.

A third example students are in favor of shoring up
honor systems that have been weakened by neglect and abuse,
“outmoded” and “mean-

rather than scrapping the systems as
ingless.”

Washington and Lee is a peculiar institution, one steeped
in tradition, one unresponsive to rapid change, and one often-
ed chastised for being out of step. And yet the dilatory pace
of change exhibited here has spared the University the
trauma of excessive change and subsequent retrenchment.
Careful deliberation and purposeful but restrained modifiea-
tion have brought us to the point toward which others are
backpedaling from their avant-garde but tenuous positions.

—S.C.Y.

Quiet places to study

It has been brought to the attention of the student govern-
ment that the list of study rooms available on campus in the
evenings is dimmishing. Many classrooms, and in some in-
stances nearly whole buildings, are locked up in the late after-
noon, to sit idle until A Period the following day, More and
more students are forced to spend their nocturnal study hours
in MeCormick Hall, a building already taxed to its limits in
daily use.

Some administrators have suggested that students are de-
nied access to some rooms in order to prevent them from
“trashing” them at night, leaving a mess for some unwitting
professor to cope with the following day. It has also been
mentioned that a single student using a classroom is not worth
the electricity wasted,

We disagree. McCormick cannot supply the student body
with all the study space it needs, and the new library is still
shrouded in the mists of the future, It seems unreasonable
to deny students the use of rooms for study purposes. A single
student seeking a quiet room within which to study is not go-
ing to generate a roomful of garbage to clutter up desks, nor ts
he going to cause the electric bill to skyrocket,

Students are here to study, Let them.

Letters to the

Ring-tum Phi editor,

articles criticized
Editor, The Ring-cum Phi:

‘The three issues of the Phi that
have been published so far have
been just awful, The writing is unin-
spired, the headlines are dead, the
“Traveller” column is Z-7-7-Z-7-7Z,
and the editorials are pompous and
empty.

‘The problem is clear. Pi Kappa Phi
has a stranglehold on the Publica-
tions Board, That board dictates the
editors of the campus publications,
including the Phi, It is no surprise
that the editor of the Calyx, an edi-
tor of the Ariel, and the editor of
the Phi ave all members of Pi Phi.
While some are certainly qualified,
some obviously are not,

The editors should be selected on
the basis of merit, not fraternity mem-
bership. With this in mind, TP back
the suggestion that the Publications
Board be reorganized. The Journal-
ism Department should appoint three
students to the board, The editor of
the Calyx should appoint one stu-
dent. And, one student should be
appointed by the editor of the Ariel.

Clearly something must be done to
return the = student Publications
Board to the students. If these sug
gestions are followed, it will be.

WLUR programming

comes under fire
Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

lt certainly is refreshing to wake
up cach morning to WLUR's an-
nouncement of the day's lunch at the
Buena Vista Public Schools. One
might expect morning programming
at a college radio station to consist
of refreshing soft rock and announce-
ments pertaining to student affairs;
but of course, this is a totally unjust
expectation when one is confronted

He has a certain flair with the songs
but they are only replays, His really
shining moments come on his own
compositions, from “Nature's gonna
get you” (an ode to Blue Ridge
honeybees), to a song about a girl
with an unusual name, because, “How
could you not write a song about a
girl with a name like that?”

Owen hails from upstate New York,
where he and an occasional partner
named Douglas Paul write songs to-
gether, He said he finds W&L a
“nice change” not only from the
scenery to Which he is accustomed
but also from the other Rathskellers

editor

with the brilliant and original LUR
morning show, consisting of a fifteen
minute weather report and bland
and repetitious music.

Our radio station's programming
at other times shows great diversity,
and is beyond reproach, It is undeni-
ably a radio broadcasting coup to
vary from programs on Italian Mas-
ters of the sixteenth century to Ttal-
ian Masters of the seventeenth cen-
tury. May I be so bold as to suggest
more Gregorian chants, since their
great popularity amongst the stu-
dents is clearly manifest. Certainly,
music of the primitive instruments of
Indonesia would also make a fine
programming inclusion, considering
its universal appeal.

Vo those in Reid Hall who are re-
sponsible for LUR’s management,
and who are obviously so successful
at gaging the likes and dislikes of the
vast majority of W&L men, I say “a
job well done!”

Respectfully,
Cyrus McCormick

 

Letters-to-the-Editor are always
welcome. They should be in good
taste, refer to campus issues, avoid
excessive length and present a co-
herent point of view,

“Rathskellers are usually
places to play,” he said. In contrast,
his audience Monday night) turned
their chairs around to face him and
listened to his music in a reserved, if
not quiet manner. Owen also. said
that W&L is a “nice-looking cam-
pus.” He was especially impressed by
the tombs of the Lee family, “It was
nice seeing them all up there in the
wall,” he said. “It's beautiful.”

The students seemed to think the
same of his guitar-playing so far, ‘Phis
reviewer has not heard so much ap-
plause in the Cockpit: since Henry
Fonda ordered the demolition of New

ing of “Failsafe,”

Jan Owen has net destroyed New

impression on W&L,

a pianist if the SAB can find a piano
somewhere that will fit in the CGock-

playing a few more sets with the old
system,

‘Today he plays at 5:15—right in the
middle of Happy Hour—and again at
nine. ‘Tomorrow he will play at 6:45
and again at eight, just before the

plays three sets, one at 7 p.m., an-
other at 9 pam., and the last at 10:30,

New group organized
to coordinate speakers

A Bicentennial speakers’ bureau
will soon be in operation at W&L.

The speakers’ bureau will consist of
students who will determine their
own topics and format for delivery,

Speeches will be either informa-

ture, or persuasive, in which the
speaker attempts to make a point or
convince the audience of an opinion.

Sponsored by a Bicentennial grant
from the Virginia Internship Pro-

Sticking doors, mudslides, cold

water plague new apartments

by MIKE ODOM

From the beginning it seems as
though the recently completed Woods
Creck apartment complex has been
plagued with student complaints,
Some of them are warranted and
some, of course, ave not, Notably, the
unwarranted ones concern the limit-
ed parking space and the ever-pre
sent mud in back of the building.
Students complaining about the for
mer argue that the only place they
have to park their cars is often fill-
ed with rubble from the construc.
tion of the law school up the street;
however, right up the street in the op-
posite direction is the gym parking
area Which is specifically designated
for Woods Creck residents

two complaints which ave warranted,
The first has finally been tended to,
but it took almost three weeks to do
so, Because of poor supervision and
some hasty work, which was done in
an assembly line instead of here at
the apartments, most of the water
heating units were defective, Conse-
quently, for the first few weeks of
school many of us were taking cold
showers, It is to the credit of WRL's
Buildings and Grounds Crew, and not
Kane, that we have hot water now;

company in view of the fact that the

The one gripe which stands out
above all the others, in that it has
not been silenced, is our insufficient
heating. We do have some heat, but
the thought of studying in the bath-
with the hot shower running
doesn't really excite too many occu-
pants, Since most complaints have

been answered, this one probably

Generals defeated
by Randolph-Macon

Sports Staff

Washington and Lee University
tight end ‘Tony Perry rose to second
plaice on the all-time career list’ for
receivers as the Generals fell to Ran-
dolph-Macon, 26-14, last Saturday,

His four catches against the Yellow
Jackets, including one Hl-yarder for
a touchdown, brought his career
mark to 93 catches for 1.132 yards and
nine touchdowns. With nearly two
full seasons to go, the junior from
Waynesboro has an excellent chance
to catch the all-time leader, Steve
Mahaffey,

Mahaffey played for only two and
a half seasons (1968-69-70), but com-
piled an amazing career record of
127 catches for 1,449 yards and eight
TDs. Much of that came in his last
year, when he led the nation with
74 catches for 897 yards and two
scores.

Despite all the record-setting per-
formances, Perry and his W&L team-
mates no doubt would trade all the
statistics for a victory, hopefully this
Saturday when the Generals (0-2-1)
return home to face a tough Home-
coming foe, Southwestern of Mem-
phis, The Lynx, 2-2 for the year, will
visit W&L's Wilson Field for a 1:50
pan. kickoff,

W&L coach Bill) MeHlenry was
“greatly disappointed” at the Ran-
dolph-Macon outcome, The Generals
dominated the first half and scored
first for a 7-0 lead, but wilted badly
in the second half,

“We started off so well, moving the
ball consistently and playing some
sound defense,” McHenry comment-
ed. “Unfortunately, when our se-

A holding infraction called against
the Generals nullified a 29-yard
touchdown on which Perry made one
of his patented leaping grabs, A
week carlier against Centre, an even
more spectacular touchdown catch
was crased when officials ruled Perry
was beyond the end zone,

“Our inability to put together four
quarters of consistent football has
hurt us in all three games to date,”
McHenry noted. “We've got to work
hard this week to overcome any
mental lapses that have hurt us.”

Scouting reports indicate South-
western'’s Lynx have suffered the same
inconsistencies, particularly on of-
fense. Coach Don Lear's team has
scored at least two touchdowns in
every game, but it is their defense
that McHenry fears most. In their
last two games, both victories, South-
western has limited the opposition to
just 10 points,

Soccer winless

Despite last week's 5-0 loss to the
Bobeats of West Virginia Wesleyan,
and the four preceding losses, W&L's
soccer team is looking for a repeat of
last year’s upset of the nationally
ranked Lynchburg College Hornets
when the two teams meet Saturday
at Lynchburg.

Lynchburg fields a squad that is
balanced in every aspect of the game
and includes one of the top scorers
in the nation, Bob Coote. The Gen
erals will be fresh from a Wednesday
match with Radford at Wilson Field
that Coach Joe Lyles calls a “must
win” situation,

Coach Lyles is looking forward to
the return of scoring leader Jamie
Veghte who was out of action last
week due to illness, Lyles hopes to
sce W&L's stagnated offense come to
life,

In last Friday's game against the
Bobeats, the West Virginians only
managed one goal against the Gen-
evals in the first half, The four goals
in the second half can be credited to
the experience of the Wesleyan
team, which includes no less than two
All-Americans, Coach Lyles said he
felt the young W&L squad played its
best game of the season,

Cross Country 4-2

By ONIL COTE

The General's intva-city rival Key
dets earned the boasting rights for
Lexington by finishing on the short
end of a 15-43 score against Wash-
ington and Lee in cross country com-
petition held last Saturday at V.M.I,

Fortunately, Coach Miller and his
cight runners found solace in the fact
that despite the lopsided defeat the
Generals did manage to squeeze by
Roanoke College and Norfolk State
by scores of 25-30 and 26-29, lifting
their slate to 4-2,

A solid but unspectacular record

Polo wins

In case you didn't know, Washing
ton and Lee has a horse polo club,
The horsemen opened their season
last Friday and Sunday with two wins
over the Woodlawn club of Wood-
lawn, Va. 8-3 and 10-3. There are 11
men on the club but only 8 can
play at a time, Captain Darnall Boyd
a sophomore, was the leading scores
for the Generals in their first two
matches scoring 9 goals in the two
games combined, The horsemen will
play U.Va. in their next match this
Sunday in Charlottesville at 2 p.m.

Intramural players of the week

Golf—Phil Boge:
Football—Rick Wolfe

has been compiled by the Generals,
but it needs considerable improve-
ment if W&L wishes to be a promi
ment contender in the New England
Cross Country Championships to be
held in Massachusetts at the conclu-
sion of the regular season,

‘The match’s outcome was hardly
surprising considering that Keydet
runners finished with the five best
times, The efforts of Generals Jim
Frantz and Tem Washington (who
finished sixth and seventh) were de-
ciding factors in nosing out the Mar-
roons and the Spartans, but simply
were not enough to outclass V.M.L.,
Who seemingly fielded a quintet of
greyhounds to compete in the six
mile run,

Perhaps to a fess experienced team
the loss would be disillusioning and
would undermine the team morale
Which is so necessary for success. This
should not be the case with the Gen-
erals, however, who have been
through all this before and realize
they can redeem themseleves with a
song showing against Lynchburg
College and Virginia Wesleyan Col-
lege in next Saturday's meet,

Which was scheduled for last week's
event, withdrew from competition,

Fraternal cosmetics
and alumni appeal

Over a period three days last week a select group of
Washington and Lee alumni attended a special series of con-
designed to aid them in understanding W&L as it
now exists. They came to Lexington still clinging to images
of the W&L of their day, but left with a better comprehension
of the W&L of our day.

Some of the returning graduates had not visited Lexington

ferences

lor many a year. In several instances individuals were shocked
by the lack of a uniform dress code and appalled at the lack
of gentility displayed by students toward one another (par-
ticularly in greeting one another on campus).

Several regulations concerning student conduct and dress
were dispensed with in the late 1960's, when students were
challenging all manner of rules and laws. The general spirit
of the gentleman remains, however, even though the coat
and tie is missing. Students today are no less worthy of being
called “gentlemen” than they ever were—this point was
stressed to the alumni.

One complaint aired by a significant portion of
tending the conference, and one which has been aired before

on several occasions, concerned the physical state of the fra-
houses. Many shocked by the de-
conditions found in and around some houses,

We find it hard to believe that things are so different now
from the days of earlier students. From what we can gather,
the physical condition of many houses was far from excellent
in most days gone by, and in one case an alumnus admitted
that his house had actually improved in its appearance.

Che point is well taken, though, that some work is in order
for present fraternity members. The city is currently involved

This option of individual

strengthening it. It must be clear

that this option extends to a student

one who wishes to assume the re-

honor, rather than give it to the

Letters to the editor

Student clarifies

attack on newspaper

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

I had thought I had written a let-
ter so clear that even the Phi staff
could understand it, Obviously 1 was
wrong. T will attempt to straighten
out the writers of the replies.

According to the Student Hand-
book, the Publications Board is made
up of all editors and business man-
agers of the publications and all
former editors and business managers
still at Washington and Lee, plus one
faculty member. This year the editor
of the Phi is the president of the

Board, Five of the seven student
members this year belong to Pi
Kappa Phi Fraternity, That is fact.

My proposal for a revised Publica-
tions Board does merit comment be-
cause it is the only way the W&L
student body wil get a deeent news-
paper.

Mr. Coleman has obviously not
read my letter, I quite clearly state
how the Phi can be improved. I put
in 60 hours a week participating in
different campus activities, which
is why IT haven't been to any of the
Phi meetings. How much time does
Mr. Coleman put in at the Phi?
Obviously very litth, for he de-
himself as being only an
“occasional” contributor, In the more
than two years that I have been
here | have seen the Phi deteriorate
from a decent paper to what it now
is. Mr. Coleman has been here not
quite four weeks. Perhaps he should
refrain from speaking on subjects
about which he has lithe knowledge.

Perhaps yould should refrain from
speaking on subjects about which
you have little knowledge, Mr.
Meschutt. As quite clearly stated in
last week's Ring-tum Phi, there are
men sitting on the Publications
Board who are not listed in the
Student Handbook; these persons
serve on the Board ex ollicio, and
hold full voting rights. It is true
that five members of the same fra-
ternity sit on the Board this
but have you troubled yourself
find out how many of these
for their positions unopposed, when
no one else even bothered to run?
Ind although Mr. Coleman has only
been here for four weeks, by virtue
of the work he has put in on the
newspaper he has more knowledge
of it than yourself.

Generals fall short
of homecoming hopes

hy ONIL COTE
Sports Stalf

Playing the role of the spoilers, the
Lynx from Southwestern University
took advantage of some typical Wash-
ington and Lee schizophrenia and
went on to disappoint some 4,000
Homecoming fans by overtaking the
Generals, 27-14, ‘The loss dippe:t
Wk&L's record to 0-3-1.

“Tm very disappointed over oul
inconsistency,” moaned a sullen
Coach McHenry as he replayed
crucial moments of the game in his
mind. “We had three good oportuni-
ties to score but each time we failed
to capitalize, We came back in the
second half with some good offense
and defense but we simply couldn't
put it all together when we really
needed it.’ McHenry went on to
praise the efforts of quarterback Jack
Berry, wide receiver Mark George

and punter Bruce Howard. Although
he didn’t say, it was as obvious as
the grey hairs in his scalp that the
Generals needed a victory to bolster
the esprit. de corps.

The Generals’ overall efficiency dur-
ing the first half was plagued with
mistakes which proved costly in the
final score, the most crucial of which
occured when Berry coughed up the
pigskin in Lynx territory after being
blindsided by a Southwestern line-
man. Berry, as brilliant in defeat as
the Lynx’s Soloman was in victory,
came back just minutes later with
another threat but a heavy rush by
Southwestern rattled the field) gen-
eral and forced him to throw a drive-
killing interception, Both the Gen-
erals and the Lynx used their highly
touted defenses to held cach other
scoreless after the first period,

ond quarter by virtue of quarter-

Soccer Generals
trounce Radford

By SANDY BISHOP

Producing their best soccer match
to date, the Generals of W&L came
up with their first victory of the
season, as well as dropping a hard
fought contest to a tough Lynchburg
squad.

Using crisp passing and more plays
to the wings, W&L mustered a 5-0
win over Radford, In their best per-
formance offensively, the Generals
cominually peppered Radford’s goal
and allowed few balls to enter their
defensive half of the field.

Mike Monahan scored the initial
goal after a hustling collision with
the Radford goalie. Woods King
made it 2-0 on a nice header off a
Bill Stone cross. The Generals’ third
goal came early in the second half
off the foot of Bill Cogar. The final
woals were scored by freshman Todd
Tyson. Mark Bennett had to make
very few close saves in the shutout.

Saturday W&L faced Lynchburg’s
Hornets before a large Homecoming
crowd, Lynehburg's offense was led
by All-American Bob Coote, but
WEkL was able to keep him some-
what in check, W&L played a very
fine first half, getting some good
shots off and only allowing one mix-
up which Coote converted into a
1-0 halftime lead.

Exhaustion and the heat were fac-
tors in the second half, as Lynech-

burg blasted away at goalie Mark
Bennett, but the Hornets were con-
tinually stopped, W&L could muster
little offense as Coote came up with
his second goal and then a penatly
shot was made after Coote was
tripped, W&L played tough through-
out the match, and as the young
squad continues to play it will con
tinue to improve and convert close
matches to its favor. The Generals
go after their second win this week
against V.M.I.

Harriers Win

Tem Washington led the Generals
to a much deserved victory in cross
country competition by finishing with
a solid 27:58 time in the five mile
run to lift W&L over both Lyneh-
burg College and Virginia Wesleyan
last Saturday. The victory, which
upped the Generals’ slate to 7-2,
went largely unnoticed due to the
Homecoming football game against
Southwestern later that afternoon,
Despite the lack of publicity, Coach
Miller was pleased with the way
things went and hopes the good
fortune will continue.

The Generals overcame Lynchburg
24-31 and easily outran Virginia

tion to Washington.

back John Loebel’s three yard run.
McConkey made good on the extra
point attempt to give the Lynx a
7-4 lead, W&L avenged the score
several minutes later by putting
Loebel out of service with shoulder
injury. Loebel’s back-up, Craig
Soloman, made his presence known
and regretted by the Generals when
he pitched a five yard touchdown
pass to Rick Talley to make it 13-0.
Late in the first half Berry engaged
in a desperate race against the clock
in a futile effort to put the Gen-
crals on the scoreboard. Berry and
his comrades ripped and snorted their
way to the Cat's 4 yard line before
time ran out sending W&L into the
locker room against a 13 point deficit.

‘The outlook wasn't encouraging
when the Generals took the field in
the third quarter, W&L found itself
under the shadows of its own goal
post on its own ten yard line. Berry,
teamed with the likes of his two
deep threats, Mike George and ‘Tony
Berry, were more than equal to the
task, however, as the three waged
their own private war against the
Lynx's secondary. Berry hit on three
passes to bring the Generals to the
Southwestern 9 yard line, Eamon Cas-
sell then carried the ball into the
end zone for the long over-due score.
‘Thompson's extra point attempt split
the uprights to reduce the Lynx’s
lead to 18-7, One minute later WKL’'s
Charlie Brown picked off an errant
Soloman pass at Southwestern’s 35
yard line, From there Cassell carried
for five yards and then Berry arched
a 30 yard aerial strike which Mark
George hauled in to even the score.
‘Thompson then gave the Generals
lead on the extra point,

The Generals had their fun in the
third quarter but Southwestern
under Soloman’s leadership re-took
the lead early in the final period.
Phe Lynx played a ball control game
the rest of the way and Seloman
picked the W&L defense apart like
a surgeon. He tossed a 9 yard scor-
ing pass which climaxed a ten play
drive to put the Lynx out in front
21-14, Soloman'’s teammate, defensive
buck Jon Mischke (who had previ-
ously been beat by W&L’'s receivers),
applied the coup de grace to the
Generals by intercepting a Berry
pass and returning it to the W&L 25
vard line. Irish McConkey kicked a
23 yard field goal two minutes later
to all but put the game out of reach.
Berry, refusing to give up, came out
passing again but the ubiquitous
Mischke stole yet another pass and
the vexing McConkey booted yet
another field goal to make the final
score 27-14,

REVIEW and OUTLOOK Modern int er

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Thursday, October 23, 1975

Making mountains
out of molehills

Matters came to a head once again this week over what
role black students are to play in the University. The Student
Association for Black Unity came before the Executive Com-
mittee to complain that its recommendations to the Student
Activities Board had not been given due consideration.

After patiently listening to arguments, rebuttals, refuta-
tions, counter-arguments and the like for nearly three hours,
the EC ended the discussion by simply telling SABU that it
should appear before the Committee in future years to request
funds for activities it cares to sponsor, rather than attempting
to finance such projects through the Activities Board.

That the Executive Committee passed no resolutions and

in short did virtually nothing (except promote a clearing of,

the air) is significant. We feel that there is little the EC wisely
should do to insure that events endorsed by SABU be
given preferéntial treatment by the Activities Board. Like any
other group, SABU should be able to present its proposals to
the Board, and to push for their adoption, but sanctions man-
dated by the EC should be avoided, Having to accede to the
requests of SABU by law, the SAB would be hamstrung even
more, since it already has little choice about its main events:
Homecoming, Fancy Dress and Springs.

For the Executive Committee to impose definite rules on
the SAB and its choice of cultural events proposed by SABU
would be tantamount to admitting that overt discrimination
does exist and is sanctioned through the process of choosing
entertainment, scheduling, and so forth.

That is the crux of the matter. Although the sentiment was
never expressed in such a blunt manner, what really concerns
the members of SABU is that it believes its proposal was
killed because of prejudices held by SAB members, rather
than other considerations such as cost of the event and
scheduling difficulties. But we fail to see where the cause of
racial equality is being served by the tactics used by SABU to
inake known its displeasure.

The members of SABU took the right action by airing
their grievances before the EC. We believe, however, that
the members of SABU erred in magnifying the issue to a
distorted size and jumping to conclusions about the SAB’s
reasons for not scheduling a concert during the coming Black
Culture Program.

The SAB made a mistake by not promptly informing
SABU of its intention not to schedule a concert in January.
We also feel that, although they were perhaps negligent in
disclosing their plans specifically before SABU officers, they
were nevertheless justified in their choice of alternative en-
tertainment to a concert. In other words, from the arguments
presented before the EC, it cannot be inferred that racial
prejudice motivated the Activities Board in its actions.

Most thoughtful students recognize the plight of the black
student on this campus. More than any other group he has
unique problems in coping with life in Lexington, But this
in itself does not justify the giving of preference, dispropor-
tionate to the influence SA\BU has on campus, in matters of
entertainment, Other groups, notably the independent. stu-
dents, are currently given less deference,

The solution to future conflicts of this nature is to request
of SABU that it henceforth come before the EC to ask for
funding for events it feels are worthy of consideration, events
which benefit a wide range of students. By coming before
the EC in September during the budget hearings, SABU will
be on a par with the other standing committees, service groups
and special interest organizations. The EC's budget hearings
are a matter of public record, and therefore no misunderstand-
ings, at least of the kind typified by this current situation,
should arise. All actions taken on SABU's proposals will be
taken with its full knowledge, and it will not have cause to
suspect any surreptitious maneuvering in the decisions
reached,

by a= student-directed thesis, one
begins to ponder whether one is
wasting time there or not, Wasted

time, however, is about the last thing
that could be said about the current
production of “The Birds,” a Greek
comedy by Aristophanes.

Written in 414 B.C. “The Birds”
was chosen as a senior thesis pre-
sentation by R. Lecky Stone. Mr.
Stone chose to slightly modernize the
classic Greek comedy in his basic
character interpretations, as stated in
the program notes. At any rate, en-
joyment can be derived from wateh-

University
programs prospering this year

By TOM RENTSCHLER

Few and far between are the
genuine opportunitics to help one’s
fellow man, but this year, as in the
past, the University Federation of
Volunteers is sponsoring a variety of
programs aimed at doing just that.
Much of the impetus for the Fed-
eration comes from senior Jim Haines,
who is president of the organization,
and Mike Capetto, who is acting as
the advisor.

Under the direction of these two,
the Federation has organized various
programs falling under the category
of community services. With the
Wwhole-hearted support of the Uni-
versity the programs have grown an-
nually in involvement, In faet, the
number of applications received by
the Federation in one week exceeded
the number received last year in an
entire semester,

 

Ask Traveller

the characters to modern man’s situa-
tion,

Brad Liston as Euelpides and Dan
Scott as Pisthetairos are two weary
travellers who go off in search of
the King of the Birds, Epops the
Hoopoe (as portrayed by Alex Bour-
drez). They find him in his mountain
hideaway and try to persuade him to
establish a new land situated between
heaven and earth,

Pisthetairos puts the
a new land before the birds in the
form of a referendum, After some
comical persuasion the vote in favor
of the new land, Cukookooland, is
ascertained. Pisthetairos emerges as
the King, naturally, but first he must
reckon with the gods, After insulting
Iris (Margot Marcucei) he ends up

question of

marrying Miss Universe (also Miss
Marcucci) and flies away to happi-
ness, leaving the birds to administer
the kingdom,

My, Scott’s interpretation of Pisthe-
tairos is a fair one; the energy and
confidence he displays while on stage
are pure Scott and not unlike any of
his previous roles at W&L, (Thank
god he wears a mask this time so
we are not subjected to that obnoxi-
ous sinile.) The sore throat) with
which Mr, Scott is apparently suffer-
ing detracted somewhat from his per-
formance,

Mr. Liston (Eucipices) — is
magnetic. His every movement or
gesture reflected his fantastic — in-
terpretation of character. A fresh-
man here, Mr. Liston did quite a
bit of acting and directing in- his

Federation’s service

The community services program
consists of three projects all of which
are stalled with dedicated students
wishing to devote their free time to
those less fortunate than themselves.
The result is a very rewarding ex-
perience for those involved and for
those who receive help,

Perhaps the most rewarding project
from the standpoint of the volunteers

is the Big Brother program at the
Rockbridge Coumy Juvenile Proba-

Volunteers are asked to
guidance to children who are
in need of a mature individual to
look up to, Approximately 30) stu-
denis are involved in the project and
the activities range from simply talk-
ing to the needy children to taking
them to a football or basketball
game,

Q. Many people have been speculating as to what all this digging up of the

streets is about, Some

have ventured such proposals as subways and

air-raid shelters, Just what is going on?
A. This, obviously, has been Lexington's closely and only guarded sceret.

Hlowever, through the untiring effort of the
Lexington Baseball and
give you the lowdown Rolling Stone magazine never saw,

of Admissions, the

Campus Proctor, the Dean
‘Tea Society, we can now
‘This effort

involved torturing emigre squirrels from the Woods Creck project late
nights in Dean Atwood’s office, and thanks to them and other sources

we now have this to report:

\ wealthy alumnus, it scems, recently graduated from W&L (name

withheld),

has donated a considerable

sum of money to the “City” of

Lexington (including back parking fines) for the purpose of replacing
the streets of Lexington with, you guessed it, a system of canals, Enough
money has been provided so that the Maury and James Rivers ean be
rerouted in order to supply the water necessary,

Now you might wonder why all this is being done, It seems that

our

unknown alumnus had taken a course in

Venetian history, and

actually developed a burning passion to see and experience that famous

city,

After graduation he immediately left on a grand tour of Europe,

Naturally no Grand Tour would be complete without a visit to Venice,
and he did that, While there he learned of Venice's evil plight, in that

friend conceived a brilliant idea.

If London Bridge could be saved by transportation to the New World,
why not noble Venice? Why, the cultural renaissance this implied, the
fusion of two great cultures, might even raise the police forces’ level
of attainment to that of the prehistoric pink sloth, So that is just what

is going on,

eventually persuaded of the

tourist potential,

finally decided to go ahead with it after being shown where Venice is
on a map several times, and slated the project for completion in 1997,
the bicentennial of the fall of the Venetian Republic.

Some of the opening celebrations will include a gondola race with
each campus organization represented and a dedication ceremony in Lee
Chapel featuring Jacques Cousteau and a prominent sea otter from the
Environmental Protection Agency as guest speakers

a need for more children who need
help. The service of the student
volunteers has been overwhelmnig,

Another of the projects has been
the tutorial program organized with
the clementary schools in the city of
Lexington. A total of 90 students
volunteers devote time helping ele-
mentary students learn the — basic
reading, writing and — arithmetic
skills that they must learn. The
volunteers work closely with the
principals and teachers at the vari-
ous schools and they provide the
individual attention which many
youngsters need, but which teachers
are unable to fully provide. The
results have been tremendous. Many
children have received the necessary
tutoring to enable them to pass the
course which they would otherwise
have failed.

The most difficult of projects is
the volunteer work which goes on
at the Western State Mental Hospital
in Staunton, The 25 student volun-
teers involved in this program work
in the alcoholic ward at the hospital
and also receive in-service training
from the staff members, Many volun-
teers receive instruction in the rudi-
mentary forms of therapy; staff mem-
bers have been very pleased with the
results,

Most importantly, the volunteers
demonstrate to the patients that
they do indeed care about them. ‘This
is often the therapy that many of
the patients need and the volunteers
have been more than willing to pro-
vide it,

All of the projects are worthwhile
from any standpoint, and, accord.
ing to Capetto, the real importance
of the program is that the volunteers
are “giving a part of themselves” to
someone who is in great need of it.
\nd they receive nothing for their
service but the great satisfaction of
knowing that they have served.

Hog-calling postponed
Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

\s a member of the steering com-
mittee for the 1976 Mock Conven-
tion, | feel compelled to address the
status of the traditional Hog-Call-
ing Contest (to choose the roll call
clerk for the Mock Convention),

luce to several technical difficulties,
the contest had to be rescheduled
from last Saturday to probably half-
time at the WE&L-Georgetown game
in late November. Full details on
entry requirements will be made
available during the next month,

once “The Birds,” we should ex-
pect to see some very impressive per-
formances from him in the future,
Speaking of Mr. Liston’s gestures,
some of the local dowagers have been
heard to comment that they would
not have minded seeing Mr. Liston
in last year’s “Changing Room” pro-
duction,

John Ellis (Koryphairos) deserved
every ovation he received. Mr. Ellis
played his part with such exuber-
ance and intensity that everyone
seemed to be mesmerized by his per-
formance,

Alex Bourdvez (Epops the Hoopoe)
played his character with energy, but
not really with enough. Possibly not
Bourdrez’ fault, his stage presence
and some of his lines were either
stepped on by our two travellers or
lost in the cacaphony of the chorus.

The chorus, with captain Don
Hogle, a 1975 graduate of W&L, did
a passable job of interpreting the
chorus of a Greek comedy, The main
problem was that the University
Theatre does not have the acousties
of an amphitheatre, It is a shame
that we lost what we did because
of a few hoots or caws. The choreo-
graphy of the chorus (by Hogle) was
as we should expect it to be with
Mr. Hogle’s direction, rather good,
A problem here is that it is hard
to make a Nureyev of a football
player.

The double and sometimes triple
parts were handled extremely well
by all, even though we could notice
when the actor was really enjoying
himself, as shown by Chris Willet
(Kenesias) and Brian Garr (Tri-
ballos).

Miss Mareucci (Iris and Miss Uni-
verse) did a very entertaining job as
she floated down from heaven, The
Theatre really gets the damnedesi
people to fly in that swing. One does
wonder how they are going to work
that swing into “Endgame,” “The

Visit’ and “1776!”

really do not understand Mr,
Romanchuk’s use of an effect’ like
the swing so soon after using it
prominently last’ spring. IT wonder
because Mr. Romanchuk certainly

outdid himself in other respects this
time. ‘The set, for example, superbly
represents the top of a mountain in
Greece.

Costumes and masks are very
effective, the color and form adding
a striking visual aspect to offset the
bleak mountain top,

Aristophanes’ play is in sum a

Failing to score on numerous oc-
casions, the Generals of W&L lost to
a quick and talented VMI soccer club
2-0 dropping their season record to
1-7.

The game was similar to last year’s
W&L-VMI contest which ended in a
1-1 deadlock. This year however,
VMI wound up on top. The
Lexington arch-rivals fought a close,
seesaw contest until a VMI lineman
cracked the nets for the score with
21:17 elapsed in the second half,
The Generals displayed good ball
control most of the game but couldn't
quite put it all together when they
reached the VMI goal, VME spoiled
the Generals’ hopes for a come-from-
behind vietory 20 minutes later as a
\MI lineman drilled a long, hard
shot in the Generals’ goal with 3:54
remaining in the game. The Gen-
ervals last-minute efforts failed and
the Keydets won 2-0. The sad part
about the game is that W&L should

later the ‘Vigers marched downfield
again with another threat but a last

touchdown pass failed when Snod-
grass, Hampden-Sydney's burly tight
end who seemingly played the game
with Mazola rubbed on his hands,
dropped the ball after sneaking be-

W&L's misfortunes continued into
the opening minutes of the second
half. ‘The defensive tackle

again giving the Cats good position.
From there the ‘Tigers inserted thei

Support for rugby team needed

By KEN MASTRILLI

In recent years, rugby at W&L has
for some reason earned a very
ignominious reputation as a sporting
outlet for all those that are eithe
mentally deficient or of a sadistic
persuasion, Upon inquiring about
this peculiar atitude, many com
ments that I've received have only
enforced these assumptions. Expres-
sions like “you gotta be nuts,” oF
“I like my body just the way it is,
in one piece,” and others of a simi-
liar nature dominate the main types
of reply. Undergruates have the no-
tion that only law students partici-
pate, None of these assumptions have
any foundation whatsoever.

It is necessary that the game be
put in the proper perspective, Rugby
really is not any more dangerous
than daily life in the freshmen domi-
tovies, as almost any upperclassmen
could tell you of many harrowing
experiences that he has encountered,
Serious injuries are
existem due to the very mature of
the game, There is no blocking al-
lowed, which cuts down on the num-
ber of knee injuries, and since the
ball is in constant movement there

almost non

is lithe chance of high speed col-
lision between players.

True, law students comprise a ma

jority of the players but there are
also close to ten undergraduates that
play regularly, This year there will
be a number of openings due to
graduation and it that
we arouse an interest in the under-

is essential

graduate ranks to keep the program
going.

One learn the rules in a
very short time; we don't practice
more than one time a_ week,

and

you don't have to have any ex-
perience in order to tryout, Almost
everyone gets to play, as we
two teams, an A side and a B side.

Both teams get to play each week,

and if you show up you get to play—
it's that simple,

Thompson also said that the Na-

the same week as the SABU culture
program is being held to provide
some variety in campus entertain-

Thompson cited the fact that there

campus at some time during the

Berry, desperately attempting to even
the score, threw a costly interception
to H-S'’s Mike Paxton. Ferguson's
third field goal of the game followed
to all but end the game.

Berry, refusing to concede defeat,
went to the air again on the Gen-
erals’ next possession, only to have
another pass picked off, this time
by defensive back Baril, Baril re-
turned the ball to the W&L 21 yard

down to the 10 yard line. Half back
Drew Davis ran it in two plays later
to make the score 29-13 which was

that SABU might be aided with
money from the E.C, Funding budget,

Some “competition”

to augment coverage of
campus events supplied by the Ring-tum Phi. In this endeavor
we wish the students involved good luck, and we look forward
with much anticipation to what will probably be called the
W&L Times.

McCullough: his views
on honor, co-education

By PAUL MORELLA
Managing [Editor

\ number of important issues have

been cropping up on campus re-
cently—issues that affect every mem-
ber of the student body, Of course

there are the usual topics of dis-
cussion such as the honor system and
the prospect of coeducation, but
SABU-SAB situation, the fraternity
crisis, and a new student newspaper
have also been added to the list.

Although these issues are almost
virtually unrelated, they all do have
one thing in common they all
coalesce around the Executive Com-
mittee of Washington and Lee,

The person in charge of the EC
is student body president Leland Me-
Cullough, who recently expounded
upon his feelings in relation to the
many that confront the stu-
dent body,

The Politics-Spanish major who is
eventually planning to attend law
school has thus far successfully met
the vast contingency of challenges
that the oflice of president presents,

“I found myself very apprehensive
at first,” said McCullough, “and I
didn't know how easily problems
would crop up, In any case, I don't
regret having run for the office,

“The Executive Committee deti-
nitely has its problems,” said = Me-
Cullough, “but the thing that
keeps me extremely optimistic is the
fact that everyone on this commitice
works together very well. We accept
each other's criticisms, but at the
same time we work together to help

issucs

one

solve all problems in the best in-
terests of the student body.”
In an interview, McCullough ex

pressed his views on the honor sys-
tem, coeducation and the more cur-
rent problems that the EC has been
confronted with.

He feels that this year the honor
system is stronger than before.
“We decided not to bring up any
first semester polls on the honoi
system because the whole debate can

be very confusing, especially to fresh-

evel

men. We feel that freshmen will
understand the system better if the
whole talk of change doesn't come

would probably look very strongly at

ever, they are also exploring the issue

thing step by step. I am confident
that whenever they do make a de-
cision, it’s going to be the right one,”
McCullough also spoke on his feel-
ings concerning the more recent prob-
lems that have come before the
and are causing a widespread debate
among members of the student body,
“The current fraternity situation
is more serious than a lot of people
think, The feelings against fraterni-

lough.
“The board of trustees has called

One of the things the EC has done
is to climinate all the Red Square

grain parties. MeCullough said that
this decision was reached by the
houses in the square as well as the

EC and would be a big step in help-
ing to ease the present situation.

“One thing the alumni don’t think
about,’ stated McCullough, “is the
fact that some of them also tore the
houses apart when they were here.”

In conclusion McCullough urged
more students to attend the EC mect-
ings and express their feelings. “Stu-
dents should realize that all meetings
are open and everyone will be listen-
ed to,” said McCullough, “and we
definitely appreciate the student body

ters that concern W&L.”

Generals fall to
Sewanee, 13-3

By KEN MASTRILLI
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee's football
team has yet to win a game, Two
costly penalties Saturday proved dis-
astrous for the Generals as they
dropped a 13-3 decision to University
of the South, at Sewanee, The loss
lowers the Generals record to 0-5-1.

Trailing 7-0 late in the second
quarter, General defensive back Jack
Norberg intercepted a pass and re-
turned it 10 yards to the Sewanee
38 yard line, The Generals then
drove to the one yard line despite a
clipping penalty and an illegal mo-
tion infraction, A penalty for hav

Despite the loss, Coach MeHenry
said it was the team’s best effort of
the year. The offensive line perform-
ed much better than in previous
weeks and enabled the Generals to
move the ball consistently on the
ground for the first time this sea-
son, Sophomore running back Ed
Johnson gained 96 yards on 19 car-
ries, by far the best ground gaining
effort by any W&L back all year. Ed
was named the offensive player of
the week by the coaching staff and
deservedly so, Johnson has worked
very hard to get a starting position
and makes the best out of every op-
portunity he gets to help the team,

But what hurt the Generals the
most were the costly errors at critical
moments in the ball game, The Gen-
erals were penalized a total of 120
yards for the game. Defensively, the
Generals were equal to the task most
of the time. Momentary lapses are
bound to happen when the defense

game and gave the offense numerous

In the game against Roanoke the
Generals spent the better part of
the afternoon in front of the Roa-

outshooting the visiting team 31-14.
In the first half W&L got goals from
Jamey Veghte, Mike Monahan, Bill
Cogar, and Mark Derbyshire. Fresh-
man ‘Todd ‘Tyson added the fifth
goal in the second half. Goalie Mark
Bennett registered 15 saves for the
Generals,

Playing under the lights at Madi-

best game to date. The Dukes were
shut out in the first half but man-
aged to score midway through the
second half and then held off W&L
for the remainder of the game. The
Generals’ defense, led by fullback
Jeff Barr and Greer Barrioult, played
an inspired game and repeatedly
broke up scoring threats from Madi-

ed a superb game in the nets, allow-

REVIEW andOUTLOOK ‘The old Hotel Robert E. Lee:

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Thursday, November 6, 1975

Mid-winter break:
schedule it in March?

\t its monthly meeting on Monday the faculty tabled vot-
ing on the proposed calendar for 1976-77 until its December
meeting. The University Council had requested such action ;
the schedule contains two changes which we feel students
hould know about before the final vote is taken.

For one, as it now stands the Christmas Holiday would
extend for little over two weeks, rather than the normal three
break. Unfortunately this to keep

appears

happens to fall on September 6 next year. As compensation for
the shortened Christmas break, there will be two weeks be
tween Thanksgiving and the start of examinations, giving stu
dents more time to prepare (with the inclusion of a weekend
between the late November vacation and the onslaught of
linals).

What bothers us much more than the foreshortened De-
cember holiday is the placement of the so-called Washington

tant scheduling of Commencement exercises and possibly
classes in June places students seeking summer employment at

it
an undue disadvantage. But if we are to have a break in the
term, it should occur at a reasonable time, most logically im
mediately after mid-term exams.

We fail to see the advantage in postponing the vacation
until early Mareh. The January-February doldrums remain un-
broken, skiing opportunities are missed, and students do not
receive a much-needed respite after encountering mid-terms.

Proponents of the change argue that a later break allows
students time to relax before the final “term-paper rush”, that
the Winter Term does not need a recess smack-dab in the
middle. Apparently the move is strongly supported by the
\thletie Department, but even that influence should not out-
weigh the fact that the break was incorporated into the calen-
dar to allow students to escape for a few days in the winter.

Phe faculty delayed action on the proposal in order to give

tudents time to air their views. We encourage persons with

trong feelings on the subject to discuss the calendar with a

faculty member, or to contact the Ring-tum Phi, The faculty

is viving us the opportunity to make our views on their ac

tions known, Let’s not disappoint them.

Contact seeks additional funds;
hopes to sign Truman Capote

By JOK

FITZGERALD

Bill Flesher appeared before the
Executive Committee Monday night
to ask for $2400 in order to bring
Truman Capote to campus as part
of the Contact °76 series.

Phe E.C, delayed the vote until
Kesher can look into the possiblity

funds from other
such as parental contribu-
tions and money from other speak-
both at W&L and at near
by colleges,

\nother reason for postponing the
appropriation to give the E.C,
time to find out whether students
want their money spent to bring the
noted author to W&L.

Capote’s appearance, if he is sign-
ed by Contact, would follow” the
publication of new books by the
Writer in January and February,

In other business the E.C. decided
to comtinue discussion of the W&L
calendar at their next meeting.

The decision to continue the talks
came following a few minutes of
debate concerning whether — the
Winter break should be shortened,
discontinued, moved to a later date
in the term, or left the way it is.

Bobby Pugh argued against a sug

that the vacation be moved
to eight weeks into the term instead
of six. He cited the fact that the
E.C, would be forced to amend the
section of the student body constitu-
tion dealing with elections.

The proposed change in the sched-
uling of the break would have
seeking office filing — for
candidacy the week before the break,
and the elections falling on the Mon-
day afterwards.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
Thursday, November 13, 1975

Is a thief
a man of honor?

The letter concerning the Honor System printed elsewhere
on this page brings to the fore a point that has been disturbing
us for some time: students are gradually drifting away from
embracing the basic belief that a code of honor should include
lying and theft as violations (as well as cheating and plag-
iarism), or at least that is the impression that they are con-
veying to their elected Executive Committee representatives

who administer the system.

How cana thief be equated with an honorable man? Honor
ignifies a keen sense of ethical conduct, according to our
dictionary and our common sense, Since when is thievery
considered ethical conduct?

‘To lie is to willfully deceive, to provide false information,
It this ethical? Is this honorable?

We cannot ascribe to the twisted logic that lauds honor
on the one hand but tramples it on the other. Either a man
is honorable in all that he does or he is nothing more than a
dishonorable man. He cannot leave his honor in the class-
room with his pledged paper; he cannot “lift” an ashtray
from Fairfax Lounge or “borrow” some money from another
person and in good conscience call himself an honorable man
worthy of attending this University.

Honor cannot be quantified by degree; transgressions
against its spirit cannot be codified. One cannot say: This act
is an honor violation, but that act, which violates the same
principle to a lesser degree, is not.” Honor is not a nebulous
contruct of the philosophical or idealistic intellect—it is
a vibrant, positive framework around which one’s character
can be built.

Any dishonorable act, particularly in reference to stealing,
is worthy of referral to the Executive Committee, no matter
how insignificant the act might appear on the surface. Will
an ashtray thief always stick to pocketing such paltry and
relatively worthless loot? Will the individual who on the one
hand abrogates his pact of honor (implicit in his attendance
at Washington and Lee) abide by the system in all other
respects ?

lt is argued that perhaps if a graduated penalty scale were
introduced better enforcement of the Honor System would be
the result. We disagree with this premise, Putting aside con-
siderations of the sheer magnitute of establishing the penal-
ties and correlating those punishments to specific crimes, we
feel that the installation of such a system would defeat the
whole purpose of the Honor System, Our collegiate com-
munity should by nature be idealistic; college is the prose-
lytizing influence which gives our idealism room in which to
find visible expression. Making concessions to the tainted
“real world” by diluting the strength of our beliefs would
work against us. We would leave this place with second-rate

ideals, and our contribution to society as individuals with

integrity would be second-rate.

Chere are some who favor the total abandonment of all
precepts of an administered Honor System, To those we must
the
considerations mean nothing to you? If so, why did you decide

Which belonged to a former
tenent of the room, He is unable to
form relationships with other people,
but he is able to control his fricnd-
ship with the cat to the point where
it no longer threatens him,

The Litthe Man is visited by an
Old Man, the Landlady’s father-in-
law, Feeble and nearly blind, the
Old Man is totally disillusioned with
modern industrial society and its
insatiable appetite for profit. He is
finally carted away when his ravings
against “the bosses” disturb the other
roomers, but the audience is forced
in the end to acknowledge that the
Old Man is the most sane and
perceptive character in the play.

The Strangest Kind of Romance
is directed by Brian Garr, with the
assistance of Rick McHan as Stage
Manager and in a minor acting role.
‘The cast also includes Rob Mish as
Little Man, Lecky Stone as Old Man,
Marti Marcucei as the Landlady, and
Bill Hirshman as the Boxer.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Thursday, November 20, 1975

A note on policy

In the past it has been the policy of the Ring-tum Phi to
allow the publication of editorials written by staff members
other than the editor. In keeping with this policy we have
decided to print the following column, written by Joseph Fitz
gerald, one of our assistant news editors, Mr. Fitzgerald has
been the Ring-tum Phi's regular political correspondent, 1.e.
on-the-scene reporter at Executive Committee meetings, for
well over a year. As such he has gained more insight into how
that body governs than nearly any other person on campus.

something to attack them for, it is just as unusual for them

can remember, the F.C. met without forming any commit
tees, subcommittees, or study groups to further compound

the problems of a tangled, twisted, overweighted student gov

ernment that is so bureaucratically complex that not even

understand or control it anymore.

So far this vear the E.C. has formed committees to study
tternity house damage, recruitment activities (or lack there
of) by the Student Association for Black Unity, the govern

At its regular December meet-

the Washington Holiday from the
1967-77 academic calendar.

The vote followed the presenta-
tion of three proposals submitted
by the University Council, which
had discussed the topic at length
in its meeting on November 19.

The faculty E.C. had recom-
mended to the University Council
that next year’s Washington Holi-

The burglaries occurred at lo-

By THE NEWS STAFF
The Executive Committee of

break from legislative activity
Monday night, taking a calm mo-
ment to look over their accomp-
lishments of the last weeks of the
fall term and to look ahead to
upcoming matters of great im-
portance such as the spring town-
gown meeting, the coming of
Truman Capote, and the ninety
minutes preceding Super Bowl X.
Freshman reprsentative Billy
Webster was astounded to learn
that the wise and elder senior
members of the committee could
give him no significant answer to
his question of what would be
done on a mammoth hour-and-a
half program scheduled to precede
the Super Bowl
During the last E.C. meeting
before the Thanksgiving break,

no break at all.

Members of the U.C. expressed
varying sentiments, Dr. Jay Cook
suggested having no break and
ending school a week earlier in
May, arguing that this would help
students economically. Seniors
Scott Stevenson and Keith Crocker
said that the students needed a
break to relieve mental stress.
Junior Ken Voelker pointed out
that a 9-day break forced out-
of-state students to go home and
incur an unnecessary expense.

John Gunn said that moving
graduation forward by a week
might mean that the senior class
could not graduate with the law
seniors. Dr. John DeVogt added
that financial aid students were
burdened by the many breaks.

Six motions were made during
the U.C. meeting, three of which
passed. Voelker’s resolution that
the break last for 4 days was
adopted 15-6. Crocker’s motion
that this break occur during the
seventh week passed 12-4. The
Council also approved 9-5 junior
Woody Woodell’s motion that the
9-day break proposed by the fac-
ulty E.C. come after six weeks.

it, having raised more money than
any other contender. The Jack-
son campaign strategy is handled
by Director Bob Keefe (no rela-
tion to W&L’s Director of Public
Information) and National Co-
ordinator Bill Brawley.

The Jackson brain trust has
two basic goals: refining the po-
litical time clock so as to rise
in early June and serve as the
alternative to George Wallace.

According to staff members, the
campaign is right on schedule.

Brawley is a veteran of
presidential campaigns and he
looks it. With cold eyes and a
cigarette constantly dangling from
his mouth, the South Carolinian
looks like the worst results from
a voter opinion poll. Speaking
from a cluttered office that was
once a bedroom of a two-story
home on 2nd Street, Brawley said
he was not worried about winning
or losing in the first primaries.
“This is a race of staying power
The candidate who has the stay-
ine power, and that means some
popularity but mainly the money
to pay the bills the first week
of June, is likely to be the one
to go to vietory.’

“There are three or four men
in New Hampshire (Jackson is not
running there, but sticking pri
inarily to the large industrial
tates) who are almost in a dead
heat, and in a frantie effort to

come out first spend their last
dollar. And after that they are
out of money ... so I think
you will find a drastic drop off
after the New Hampshire and
Massachusetts primaries.”

After Massachusetts Jackson
will concentrate efforts on the 540
delegates to be won on June 8
in California, New Jersey and
Ohio.

To pose as an alternative to
Governor George Wallace, Jack-
son will emphasize the economy
with employment programs,
energy by imposing mandatory
reduction in consumption, and

Capote signed
for appearance

here in March
By THE NEWS STAFF

Truman Capote has been signed
for the Contact °76 symposium.
He will appear on March 15 and
speak on American literature and
give readings from his three
books, Answered Prayer, Break-
fast at Tiffany's, and In Cold
Blood,

He may also give readings from
a book scheduled for publication
in February. Capote’s appearance
also follows closely on the heels
of a movie in which the noted
author and playwright will make
his first appearance as an actor
instead of a director.

Capote’s appearance was made
possible by a last minute grant
of $1000 from the E.C. The money
given was $1100 less than Contact
co-chairman Bill Flesher’s or iginal
request.

Capote will be speaking in the
gymnasium the same week as the
visits of author George Plimpton
and Chicago 8 attorney William
Kunstler, Kunstler will speak on
the subject of civil rights, a field
in which he has argued several
controversial cases in recent
years. The lawyer will appear on
March 16, preceding Plimpton on
the 17th.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Thursday, January 8, 1976

Now you see it,

now you don’t

Using logic even Aristotle would have difficulty following,
the faculty at its regular December meeting decided to
abolish the mid-winter break, at least for the '76-’77 year.
Rather than earning the displeasure of any small segment of
the student body that would have been disappointed with the
timing of the break no matter when it would have been
scheduled, our professors have chosen to dispense with the
holiday altogether, possibly earning the displeasure of all
students,

True, without the vacation it will be no problem for the
sciences to schedule the required number of labs, the athletic
department will have no difficulty in arranging home games,
and we students will arrive home one week earlier in May.

What concerns us is that there will be no break in the
monotony of twelve solid weeks of academics during the
most dreary part of the year. Many students we know had
enough difficulty in retaining their sanity during the long
haul preceding Thankskiving, a long haul at least punctuated
with a few diversions such as Homecoming and Parents’
Weekend, With only Fancy Dress to enliven the bleak winter
months, the second term could be transformed into a more
formidable period than it already is. Students will have more
difficulty working efficiently throughout the term.

There was much discussion preceding the vote on whether
to retain the break as it occurs this year, or to alter it in
some fashion, There were proposals to shorten it to two
school days, to keep it at its present length but place it in
March, and to use a combination of the two. Some people
thought a week too long; others saw no sense in a half-week
holiday. Some thought there was much to be said for leaving
the break in February, after mid-terms; others felt placement
near the end of the term would help students gather their
strength for a last lusty push toward examination.

Confronted with this bewildering array of opinions, the
laculty was stymied. So rather than take sides in the issue,
it chose to withdraw the issue altogether, ruling out the
inclusion of any vacation during next year's winter term. The
logic behind this action is obscure, if existent.

Twelve weeks plus one week of exams is an awfully long
time to work diligently at studies, without at least a mo-
mentary pause to catch our breath, We sincerely believe that
the faculty has erred, We personally saw nothing dreadfully
wrong with the short winter break of years past—at any rate
we feel that there is a definite psychological need for a holiday
partway through the term. The faculty's action was taken in
the name of expediency, and it resolved the Great Calendar
Debate, temporarily, We nevertheless question the wisdom of
the decision.

S.C.Y,

Outside the classroom

there are opportunities

It may almost seem impossible, but we are nearly half way
through another academic year. The holiday went by too
quickly, and we find ourselves suddenly confronted with a
iresh set of courses, after having just dispatched with the last
batch (or so it seems),

With the new term getting into full swing, we should stop
for a moment and reflect on what we are trying to accomplish
with our time here, Sure, we all attend classes and parties,
but what else are we doing? Have we gotten involved in
those organizations we “keep meaning to join”? Are we doing
anything more than just drifting through, studying as little
as possible but really learning much less than even that?

Most groups active on the campus would welcome new
inembers heartily right now—some need more participants
just to continue funetioning properly, Several worthwhile
etivities that come to mind inelude the Mock Convention,
the University Federation, music and drama groups, and of
course publications,

We should strive to develop ourselves as completely as
possible during our college years. Involvement in outside
ictivities should be an integral part of this development. Is it?

Valiant waitress
foils catsup heist

Several students dressed in
plain clothes were foiled in an
attempt to make Mother's restaur-
ant the scene of an end-of-term
larceny, when a determined un-
identified waitress smashed their
bizarre scheme in an admirable
display of swift thinking, courage,
integrity, and luck.

Several students were observed
departing said pizzeria on the 12th
of December. They were running
stealthily toward their getaway
vehicle at the corner of Jefferson
and Washington Streets, and mak-
ing a great deal of noise to draw
the attention of passersby away

Lexington’s
leash law

All students and other mem-
bers of the Washington and Lee
community who may own dogs
are reminded of the Lexington
City Code concerning the licens-
ing and control of dogs. Par-
ticular attention is called to the
new leash law which was passed
by the City Council in April 1975.

All dogs six months old and
over must be properly licensed
and must wear a “collar bearing
a license tag of the proper
calendar year.” Dog licenses for
the City of Lexington may be
obtained from the Office of the
City Treasurer on East Wash-
ington Street; fines are prescrib-
ed for failure to pay the license
tax.

In addition, dogs are not to be
allowed to run at large; they
must be under the control of the
owner or custodian by means of
a leash, chain, or rope when off
the owner’s property. Section 4-6
of the City Code provides the fol-
lowing:

“It shall be unlawful for any
dog to run at large in the City
of Lexington. For the purpose
of this section, a dog shall be
deemed to run at large while
roaming, running, or self-hunt-
inf off the property of its
owner or custodian and not
under its owner’s or custodian’s
immediate control by leash,
chain, rope or other restrain-
ing device securely attached to
the dog’s harness or collar.”
Fines, in the minimum amount
of five dollars for the first offense
and twenty-five dollars for each
subsequent offense, are prescribed
for violations of this ordinance.

If violations of these require-
ments of the Lexington City Code
continue to occur with frequency
on University property the re-
mainder of the academic year, the
City dog warden will be invited
to the campus periodically, with-
out prior notification, to impound
unlicensed dogs and dogs found
to be “running at large.”

Study skills
course offered

As a service to Washington and
Lee students, the University has
once again this year engaged
Baldridge Reading and Study
Skills, Inc. to offer on campus a
special program designed to im-
prove reading and learning skills
in academic subjects.

The program is not merely a
speed-reading course. Its techni-
ques are designed to increase
reading speed, to strengthen com-
prehension, to improve recall, to
sustain concentration and to
deepen analysis. A student uses
his own classroom reading ma-
terals rather than mass-prepared
instructional literature and me-
chanical training aids.

This program will be conducted
on the Washington and Lee cam-
pus by an instructor from Bald-
ridge Reading from January 12
through February 6. Scheduling
will be flexible to accommodate
individual student schedules, and
classes will be small to permit
necessary individual attention.
Each student will attend a total
of twenty sessions, five per week.
Tuition for the program will be
$75, payable by the start of the
program upon receipt of a state-
ment from Baldridge.

Further intormation and regi-
stration cards may be obtained
from the Office of the Dean of
Students, Washington Hall 25.
Interested students should regis-
ter for the course as soon as
possible,

from the catsup bottle one of the
criminals had perfidiously swiped
from an unsuspecting table.

The quick thinking waitress
copied the license number of the
offending vehicle as it sat in the
middle of the intersection with
its driver desperately attempting
to start it.

As the robbers ran about in
the street, some pushing the ve-
hicle, some perusing the area
beneath the hood and hypothisiz-
ing learnedly, the waitress boldly
strode up to the villain holding
the catsup bottle and siezed it
from him in no uncertain terms.

Although the local constabulary
had been summoned, the culprits
managed to get the vehicle start-
ed at last, spraying the area sur-
rounding the intersection with a
near-fatal cloud of carbon mon-
oxide and gravel dust.

When asked about the condi-
tion of the delinquents involved
in the foiled attempt, the waitress
replied that, “They were all drunk
as Hell.”

When asked about what police
action she expected as a result
of the incident, she speculated
that the law might also be in a
state of inebriation on the eve-
ning in question.

Ask Tra

 

Dear Traveller: 1 am a freshman and am somewhat confused as to
how to get good grades in some courses. Do you have any hints?

Signed, G.P.A. 0.01

Dear Academic Pro: I really can’t give you much help—the ways of
the wild and of the profs are beyond me. However, never let it
be said that Traveller won't try. Here are some clues I gathered

Music 151—Whistle Beethoven's Fifth when you pass him on the
walk, and sit next to Shills at concerts.

Politics 230—Get to know Mrs. Miller.

History 150—Join S.A.B.U. (a slight problem for some).

History 354—Purge yourself of your Southern drawl.

Anthropology 101—Go out for the team, you fool. If you don’t
play just carry a stick around with you.

Mathematics 102—Wear bobby-socks.

Military Science 102—Transfer to V.M.I.

Philosophy 208—Fall asleep on the Front Campus while con-

templating the Sun.

Greek 102—Go to the Toga Party.

album; at least one prof will be pleased.
Journalism 102—Throw a brick at the editor of the Ring-tum

Phi.
Chinese 101—Squint.

Letters to the editor

Student finds Thymes

appalling ...
Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

Upon reading the second issue
of the “‘W&L Thymes” I was even
more appalled than I was after
I read the first issue. Articles con-
taining phrases like “Amerika,”
“corporate pigs,” and ‘“macho-
boozo-frat-dubyanel trip facade”
belong somewhere else — any-
where else — besides the W&L
campus.

The typical W&L gentleman is
lambasted owing to his dress,
speech, social concerns, etc., while
the obvious minority is represent-
ed as the norm on campus.

Funds must not be appropriat-
ed for this “alternative” news-
paper. Funding a newspaper that
appeals to such an obvious mi-
nority would constitute reverse
discrimination as well as be
utterly foolish. A rag depicting
W&L in such a light has no place
on this campus. It is truly my
hope that this “thing” ceases
functioning before any prospec-
tive students obtain copies of it
and judge the merits of W&L by
it.

Respectfully,
Scott M. Stevenson, Esq., "76A

. . . but then, doesn’t
everybody?
Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:
Enclosed is a copy of a letter I
sent to the Thymes. Since this
past issue of the Thymes is prob-
ably the last we will see of it, I
would appreciate it if you would
print the letter in the Phi.
November 21, 1975
To the Editors and Staff of the
Thymes
Dear Sirs:
GROW UP OR GIVE UP
After I had read the first issue
of the Thymes, I had hoped that
it would die of natural causes.
Unfortunately, it did not; the
second issue only goes to confirm
my belief that it should have.
Your “seasoned look at Washing-
ton and Lee”’—which you so wit-
tily call it—is nothing more than
a piece of sophomoric trash.
Your stated purpose is “to bring
before the W&L community the
pertinent issues of today.” Do
you really think that Ms. Kellum’s
sugarcoated account of her peril-
ous trek to the Beta house is
“pertinent?” I am glad, however,
to know that Ms. Kellum and the
Betas lived happily ever after.
And what o% your “on-the-spot
look at W&L’s fairer neighbors?”
I fail to see anything of value in
these adolescent “reports.” Look
at the pretentious sociological
jargon you have used to conceal
what is really a sick and in-
fantile obsession with sex: “When
asked a leading question about
the development of a sexual re-
lationship after the third or fourth
date, about 15% of the girls said
simply ... “—igle, giggle, ed
nauseam.” In short, it seems as
though your writers have just
reached puberty, and are pres-
ently engaged in journalistic mas-
turbation
I do have some complimentary

things to say about the Thymes,
Rick McHan’s article, “W&L
Drama,” was well written and in-
formative, as was Mark Mendel’s,
“The Real World: New York City.”
But this type of writing does not
need the Thymes. The Ring-tum
Phi and Ariel are both available
for such writing—although I am
not sure that the Ariel staff would
accept the immature prose and
poetry that have appeared in the
Thymes.

As for your present financial
difficulties, I have absolutely no
sympathy. Fools and their money
are soon parted.

John Gray, Jr., ’76

Former editor likes

“excellent” editorial
Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

My compliments to you, Sir, for
your excellent and thought pro-
voking editorial in your Novem-
ber 13 issue!

The Honor System has been
one of the glories of Washington
and Lee for over a century. A
man either is honorable or he
isn’t—there is no middle ground.

We have seen the sorry spectacle
of a President of the United
States forced to resign by public
opinion because he lied about
things which he felt were “a
second rate burglary.” The fact
was he lied. There was no matter
of degree.

I hope that the W&L students
of today are not immersed in the
cynicism of the market place and
the United Nations. As leaders
of tomorrow, respect for and
governance by the Honor System,
will furnish the basis of life long
self respect and happiness in life.

As a former Editor of the Ring-
tim Phi I read it with interest
and congratulate you for publish-
ing a newsy, well balanced paper
under the trying conditions of
1975!

With best wishes, I am,

Sincerely yours,
Emmett W. MacCorkle Jr. ’26

 

Letters-to-the-Editor are always
welcome. They should be in good
taste, refer Lo campus issues, avoid
excessive length and present a co-
herent point of view.

Basketball’s record slips to 3-3

BY SAMMY THOMPSON

Washington and Lee’s basket-
ball team opened their season
November 28 and 29 with vic-
tories over Washington College
and York College of Pennsylvania
by identical 86-67 scores. After
that, however, the Generals lost
three in a row before beating
St. Leo’s College December 18.

In the season opener against
York, coach Verne Canfield start-
ed 5-10, sophomore Bob Forlenza
and 6-2, senior John Podgajny at
the guards while 6-4, junior Chris
Larson and 6-5, senior Jeff Baum
started at the forward positions.
At center was 6-8, senior Norm
Kristoff.

The Generals got the lead early
in the York game as Larson hit
on several jump shots. The big-
gest margin of the half came
after eight minutes of playing
time had elapsed, giving W&L a
20-10 lead. Junior Bob Flint came
off the bench to grab nine first-
half rebounds while Larson led
in scoring with 14 points. York

narrowed the W&L lead to four
points with five minutes remain-
ing in the half. At intermission,
the Generals managed to stay on
top 38-37.

The second half started slowly
for the Generals as they missed
shots and committed several turn-
overs. York scored four points in
a row to take a 47-52 lead with
17 minutes remaining in the

game. York’s lead did not last
long, however, as W&L’s 6-8
center, Norm Kristoff, hit six

straight points to bring the Gen-
erals back. After this, W&L led
the rest of the game.

Larson, Baum and freshman
Dave Leunig spurred the Gen-
erals’ attack the rest of the
game. Bob Flint did a good job
for the Generals off the bench
winding up with 13 rebounds and
6 points. Larson was the game’s
leading scorer with 25 points.

The General’s second game of
the season against Washington
College gave W&L its second win
in an exciting contest in which
coach Canfield was slapped with

two technical fouls following the
injury of junior guard, Kim Sims.
The incident occurred when Sims
fell while dribbling down court.
A Washington College player
stole the ball as Sims lay on
the floor in agony. Canfield pro-
tested to the official that play
should have been halted when the
injury occurred. The official con-
tinued play, however, and Can-
field drew a technical foul after
his heavy protest. Afterwards, in
the locker room, it was determin-
ed that Sims had fractured the
middle finger on his left hand.

As coach Canfield sat on the
sidelines with two technicals,
W&L went on to outplay WC
and led at the half 35-30. The
game was tied in the second half
at 35-35 with 18:09 remaining.
Washington College went ahead
briefly before captain John
Podgajny hit a jump shot with
10:37 left that put W&L in the
lead for good. Flint, Leunig, Mike
Wenke and Don Berlin came off
the bench to rally the Generals
on to an 86-67 win.

Matmen victorious so far

“This looks like the best team
we've had in recent years,” said
Washington and Lee coach Gary
Franke. “Barring any injuries we
could go a long way.”

Coach Franke’s pre-season pre-
diction has been accurate so far
as W&L’s wrestling team is off to
one of its best starts in history
with three victories by big marg-
ins in its first three starts.

The Generals opened their sea-
son December 2 in Lexington beat-
ing Lynchburg College and Vir-
ginia State, 41-3 and 346. W&L
continued its winning ways the
next day in Harrisonburg against
Bridgewater College, 49-2.

Twenty-one members are on this
year’s squad which includes six
freshmen. Four of  Franke’s

wrestlers boast 3-0 records. These

Senior Rick Heldrich (167) and
freshmen Andy King (142-150)
and Kevin McFadden (167) have
won two matches.

The Generals are without the
services of junior letterman,
Steve Schweizerhof, who will be
unable to compete until some-
time in January due to an ear
injury he received playing foot-
ball.

So far the Generals have man-
aged without him, however, and

Durham, N.C. January 10 to face

The next home meet is against

Lynchburg College gave the
Generals their first loss December
1, 85-84. W&L was behind the en-
tire game and trailed by as much
as 17 points at one point in the
second half. The Generals fought
back and actually took the lead
with 16 seconds remaining but
lost it as a Lynchburg player
made a layup with four seconds
left. W&L failed to score and lost
by the narrow one-point margin.
Podgajny and Larson were the
leading scorers for W&L with 26
and 20 points.

December 3 brought the Uni-
versity of Virginia Wahoos to
town in a game which saw the
Generals trampled by a much
taller team. W&L’s first half field
goal percentage was a meager 27
per cent compared to 58.6 for
UVA. The Generals never led as
a good Wahoo team won 101-57.
The only consolation for the Gen-
erals that night was an earlier
45-44 victory against the UVA
junior varsity team by a good
shooting W&L JV team.

W&L split a pair of games over
the holidays losing to Eckerd Col-
lege 87-76 and beating St. Leo’s
College 60-54. In the St. Leo’s
game, W&L led all the way for
a win that broke a three game
losing streak and brought their
season record to 3-3. Kristoff led
the Generals with 12 points, while
Podgajny and Berlin had 10 points
apiece.

The Generals travelled to
Bridgewater College yesterday
and will host the W&L Invita-
tional January 9-10 against Lycom-

Slatcoff predicts football turnaround soon

“Within the next two years ‘the
football program is going to be
turned around, and Washington
and Lee University is going to
have a winner.”

The speaker was not the college
president soliciting funds from
the alumni, nor a football coach
trying to bolster the team’s spirits
after a 1-8-1 season. The speaker
was sophomore linebacker Jeff
Slatcoff, who is as enthusiastic
about Washington and Lee—both
the school and its football pro-
gram—today as he was when he
left Windber, Pa. two years ago
to enroll here.

‘A small school like W&L has
a lot more to offer than many big
schools,” said Slatcoff, who was
approached by several of the
larger Pennsylvania schools about
a football career there. “At W&L,
you are simply playing for your
own benefit and not being paid
for it. And in my opinion you
can't get any better education.”

Slatcoff really does talk that
way. And he “speaks” the same
language on the football field,
where he is the Generals’ lead-
ing tackler by far. In W&L’s 10
games this year, Slateoff had 189
tackles and assisted on 33 others.

,

eo

 

That's a total of 222, or over 22
a game. Plus two passes broken
up, two fumbles recovered, one
fumble caused and a blocked kick.

And those are not padded by
some publicity-happy statistician;
they’re taken from the game films
by the defensive coaches, who
don’t give any credit for merely
jumping onto a pile.

“Jeff's probably leading the
whole country in tackles,” opin-
ioned W&L defensive coordinator
Boyd Williams.

Some of Slatcoff's performances
border on the incredible, such as
the Sewanee game, when he made
8 tackles and assisted on four
more, broke up a pass and block-
ed an extra point attempt. He had
24 tackles in November against
Georgetown, 21 vs. Madison, 19
on another occasion and 18 in
three other games. And so on.
The second leading tackler for
W&L had 89 for the whole year.

There’s a great mutual ; 1
miration thing going between
Slateoff and defensive coordina-
tor Williams, who recruited him
from Windber Area High School.
Williams, a native of the same
Pennsylvania area who played for
Syracuse and the Philadelphia

Sophomore linebacker Jeff Slatcoff compiled 189 tackies and 33

Eagles, says “I wish we had more
like Jeff. He’s a hell of a com-
petitor, he busts his tail on every
play, and he doesn’t know what
the word ‘loafing’ means.”

Williams feels Slatcoff
play football anywhere in the
country, although his relative
small size (6-0, 214) might be a
handicap at a big football school.
He’s a winner, William notes. “He
came out of a winning program
in a tough area around Pittsburgh,
he hates to lose, and he’s not used
to anything but winning. | think

could

we can count on him to con-
tribute more than his share to-
ward turning this program
around.”

Slatcoff won't go far out on
any limbs in predicting the turn-
around. He simply says, “We may
not have a winning season in my

two remaining years, but before
I leave it’s going to be turned
around in that direction, The kids
that come afterwards are going
to be winners.”

Linebacker coach Chuck O’Con-
nell attributes Slatcoff’s success to
his “nose for the football” and
his upper body strength. “Lots
of times he gets to the runner
on the other side of the line
before the linebacker on that side
does,” O’Connel notes. “And he
uses his forearms very well to
ward off blockers.”

Perhaps the ultimate compli-
ment comes from Mrs. Minnie K.
Ellis, the seamstress who repairs
the Generals’ jersies after every
game. “What's that no. 66?” Mrs.
Ellis said after one recent game.
“That's the most torn jersey I've
had yet.”

In Italy in the 1800's a chance meeting between a poor
priest and a street urchin served to create a movement of such
success that it is still growing today. Don Bosco became the
priest who brought youth back from the streets — and

back to God.

He reasoned that a program of play, learn and pray would
make useful citizens of the world. He crowded out evil with
reason, religion and kindness in a (what was then unheard of)

atmosphere of family.

The ideais of St. John Bosco are still with us today. His
work goes on in boys clubs, technical and academic schools
guidance centers, summer camps and missions, And his very
human approach is very evident in the family spirit of the
Salesians. This is the way he wanted it. This is the way it is.
The Salesian experience isn't learned — it's lived.

Pratt bequeaths $11 million to W&L

Special to the Ring-tum Phi

Washington and Lee University will receive 20 per cent of the
estate—approximately $11 million—of the late John Lee Pratt, a
prominent business executive and philanthropist who died Dec. 20
in Fredericksburg, Va., at the age of 96.

The bequest is to be used for faculty salaries and student financial
aid.

Washington and Lee is one of 10 colleges and universities which
received multi-million dollar bequests from Mr. Pratt’s estate. In
addition to Washington and Lee, the University of Virginia and
Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University also received 20
per cent shares of the estate. Mr. Pratt’s other bequests ranged from
4 per cent to 10 per cent of the estate.

Under terms of Mr. Pratt’s will, which was filed for
Friday in Stafford County Circuit Court in Fredericksburg, the be-
quest to Washington and Lee is to be used “to increase salaries” for
faculty members and to permit the university to “offer more scholar-
ships for outstanding students.”

None of Mr. Pratt’s bequests are to be used for constructing
or improving buildings or for land acquisition. He also expressed
the wish that all the bequests which he made to academic institutions
in the will be spent within 25 years.

“It is my belief,’ he wrote in his will, “that the capital I leave
can best serve the purpose I desire by being converted into knowledge
that is useful and beneficial to mankind without undue delay.”

On learning of the bequest—the largest gift in Washington and
Lee’s history—the university said in a statement: “Over the past
two decades, John Lee Pratt has been one of this university’s most
devoted supporters.

“His association with and fondness for this institution trace to
his close personal friendships with several of the university’s dis-
tinguished trustees, but particularly to the strong mutual affection
which grew up between himself and the late president of Washington
and Lee, Dr. Francis Pendleton Gaines, and Mrs. Gaines.

“While we have treasured Mr. Pratt’s friendship and devotion
for more than 20 years, nevertheless we are a little overwhelmed—
and, in fact, at the moment speechless—in learning of his bequest.

“The university’s board of trustees is scheduled to meet on the
campus here for its regular mid-winter meeting at the end of this
month. The board will of course have the responsibility for determin-
ing the specific ways in which Mr. Pratt’s bequest will be used to
the best advantage of the university in helping meet his ambition
for Washington and Lee; the board will also certainly want to de-
termine the ways in which the university will formally acknowledge
his historic generosity and honor his memory.”

While the Washington and Lee bequest is designated to strengthen
salaries and expand the university’s student financial aid programs,
Mr. Pratt’s bequests to the University of Virginia and Virginia Tech
are subject to additional provisions.

probate

Che Ring-tun

If either institution does not or cannot comply with the terms
of Mr. Pratt’s will, he specified that the bequests should then come
to Washington and Lee.

The University of Virginia’s bequest is to be used to strengthen
faculty salaries and to purchase equipment in the biology, chemistry,
mathematics and physies departments, and to support research and
provide scholarships in the medical school there.

The Virginia Tech bequest is designated partly for
of animal nutrition” and partly for expanded research
ship opportunities in the Schoo! of Engineering.

The bequests to both state-supported universities are subject to
the additional provision that ihe money Mr. Pratt left must not be
used as a substitute for state appropriations. If that should happen,
he provided that the bequests would then also be given instead to
Washington and Lee.

In addition to the 20 per cent shares of his estate to Washingion
and Lee, Virginia, and Virginia Tech, Mr. Pratt left 10 per cent to
Randolph-Macon Woman’s College in Lynchburg and to Johns
Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, to support both the
geography school there and the McCollum-Pratt Institute, which he
helped establish and which conducts research in the field of “trace
elements” or “micronutrients.”

He also left 4 per cent shares of his estate,

“the study
and. scholar-

valued at approxi-

mately $2.2 million each, to Hollins College, Sweet Briar Col ege,
Hampden-Sydney College, Hampton Institute and Randolph-Macon

College.

The terms of each of those bequests are identical to the terms
of Washington and Lee’s. Again, Mr. Pratt favored Washington and
Lee by providing in the will that if any of those legacies fails, then
it is to come to Washington and Lee.

Mr. Pratt was a student for one year at Randolph-Macon Colleg2

in Ashland, then transferred to the University of Virginia, wher.
he received his degree in civil engineering in 1995.
After graduation he joined E. I. duPont de Nemours & Co. of

Wilmington, Del., and eventually rose in that company and in General

Motors, with which duPont merged in 1917. Iie was elected GM
vice president in 1922, became a director of the company a year
later, was a member of the executive committee for 11 years, and

served in other executive capacities with the GM board until 1952.

During World War II he worked as an unpaid consullant to
the American government, largely in developing the Lend-Lease
Program.

“He was a very private man,” the co-executor of his estate
Atty. Ralph M. Whitticar UI, was quoted as telling the Washington
Post. “If that’s the way he wanted it to be, that’s the way it should
be” even after his death, Whitticar said.

In a telephone conversation with the editor of the Ring-tum Phi,

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Thursday, January 15, 1976

John Lee Pratt

The students of this University are deeply indebted to the
late John Lee Pratt, philanthropist par excellence, who saw
fit to bequeath to Washington and Lee one-fifth of the fortune
he had amassed in his ninety-six years in this life.

1976 is the final year in the University’s $36 million
development program. Until noon last Friday, that goal was
still $8 millnon away. In dollar amounts, that target figure
has been reached. The student financial aid program now
appears to be out of the woods, and faculty salaries can be
increased and several endowed chairs established.

It should be noted, and emphasized strongly, that the
bequest does not assure the construction of the long-awaited
library. The Pratt money is to be used specifically for pur-
poses other than new construction. And the money cannot
be put into, say, endowment and other funds withdrawn to
facilitate construction without violating the intend of Pratt’s
will.

The continued support of our alumni and friends is as
important now as it ever was. Even more so, for other gifts
may now seem so insignificant when compared to that
mammoth sum, and yet the help of others is still needed if
the library is to become a reality.

The legacy of John Lee Pratt will not soon be forgotten,
He thought highly of Washington and Lee and what this
college stands for; let us continue to make this University
the true liberal arts institution that Pratt so strongly believed

in.

How to cross the E.C.
in one simple step

When money is appropriated for a specific purpose, but
is not used for that stated purpose, approval must be sought
before alternative uses are made of the funds. This is an
old and time-honored principle of sound financial manage-
ment and fiseal responsibility.

We have on previous occasions reminded the members of
the Executive Committee of their responsibility to see to
it that student funds are expended with discretion. Heretofore
we have not taken it upon ourselves to remind the groups
financed with student money that they have a similar obliga-
tion, Now would be an appropriate time.

On December 1, 1975, the E.C. voted to appropriate a
sum in the amount of $1000 to the Student Association for
Black Unity to assist that group in its efforts to bring to
campus Thomas Scott Young, a black poet and dramatist.
Last night in Lee Chapel there was scheduled an appearance
by Imamu Amira Baraka (formerly LeRoi Jones), noted
black playwright and poet.

What disturbs us is that S.A.B.U. did not check with its
financial backers, notably the E.C. and the Glasgow Endw-
ment, before arranging for the appearance of Baraka in lieu
of Young. Agreed, Baraka is better known than Young and
presumably .presented a better show, but no money was
appropriated for the event by the E.C. until Monday night,
when the poet's appearance was cirtually a fait accompli.

It would have been a very simple matter for Mr. Brooks,
the head of S.A.B.U,, to have reported to the KC. on the
change of plans and to have requested continued support at
the E.C. meeting of January 5, Instead, Mr. Brooks appeared
hefore the Committee on January 12, at the behest of sev-
eral Committee members, and after it) was evident that
arrangements for the revised program had been consummated.
Had he not been specifically asked to attend, said Mr. Brooks,
he would not have reported on the change on his own
initiative.

At the meeting, Mr. Brooks was unsure of the final
contract price, other than to surmise that it was “around
$2250 as opposed to $1750 for Young.” In other words, an
additional $500 was needed to pay for the performance. The
Glasgow Endowment had agreed to fund an extra $300,
and other S.A.B.U! Black Culture Week events were being
curtailed to cut expenses, but it was unclear at Monday night's
meeting if the $500 deficit would be met, In other words, it
is possible that the EC, might have to pay the balance for
an event it did not approve beforehand,

It is not right for any student group, be it SA.B.U., S.A...
or the Ring-tum Phi, to spend money for reasons not origi-
nally specified when funds are sought from the EC, Such
practices might lead to all manner of problems and shady
undertakings.

It is not our intention to castigate the 5 \.B.U.
normal rules of procedure should be

un
necessarily. However,
followed, particularly when student funds are involved, All
2.C,-funded organizations should realize their obligation to
duly notify the student government when changes are made

that are of significance.

Harriet Thomas,

A private man, a public legacy

The following is extracted
from the article “John Lee
Pratt Walked With Famous,
Shunned Fame,” by John Gool-
rick, in the Fredericksburg
(Va.) Free Lance-Star, Dec. 22,
1975.

John Lee Pratt rose from a boy-
hood on a King George (Va.)
County farm to become one of the
nation’s wealthiest men.

Pratt was a former vice presi-
dent and director of General
Motors Corp. and a philanthropist
who quietly and without fan-
fare gave away hundreds of
thousands of dollars to orgniza-
tions and causes he deemed
worthwhile.

Once called by Alfred P. Sloan,
former president of General
Motors, “the best businessman I
have ever known,’” Pratt was an
intimate friend of most of the
nation’s top industrialists and
prominent politicians and other
publie personalities.

But because he shied away
from public attention, he was
little known to the general pub-
lic, though Fortune magazine list-
ed him in a survey some years
ago as 17th on a list of the 50
wealthiest persons in the United
States.

(In 1964, Time magazine re-
ported that Mr. Pratt was then
the second-largest _ individual
shareholder of General Motors
stock in the nation, “close be-
hind” Alfred P. Sloan. Despite his
wealth, Time said, “Pratt so suc-
cessfully keeps out the public view
that he is not even listed in
‘Who’s Who’.”)

His career with GM spanned a
half-century, and during that time
he was a key figure in the com-
pany’s rise from a young and
struggling enterprise to one of
the greatest corporate giants the
world has ever known.

Gracious host at Chatham

Pratt in 1931 purchased the
historic Chatham estate which
dates to Colonial times and had
spent most of his life there since
his retirement as a vice presi-
dent of GM in 1937. (Dr. Francis
Pendleton Gaines, president of
Washington and Lee from 1930
to 1959, and Mrs. Gaines visited
Mr. Pratt at Chatham on many
occasions. After one such visit,
Dr. Gaines wrote: “I don’t know
a more beautiful home, and I
don’t know a host whose hospi-
tality is more complete and more
gracious.”)

In 1961 Pratt donated to the
cily of Fredericksburg and Staf-
ford County 75 acres of the
Chatham estate with the stipula-
tion that a park be established
on the site.

He was born Oct. 22, 1879, at
Aspen Grove in King George
County. [Ne was the last survivor
of the five children of his par-
ents, all of whom lived to ad-
vanced ages.

Pratt’s mother died in 1885
when he was six years old, and
he was tutored at home and later
attended Bethe! School in the
White Oak area of Stafford. When
he was 13, Pratt was employed
as an apprentice by M. S. Chan-
cellor Farm Implement Store in
Fredericksburg, and there, as-
sembling horse-drawn equipment,

Ariel deadline set
Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

As Ariel editors, we wish to
announe our intention of put-
ting out a special full-size edition
of the Ariel sometime during the
present term, This special edition
will feature photography in addi-
tion to the usual prose and
poetry.

All the material accepted from
our previous solicitation for the
Fall Issue will be printed in the
special issue, New submissions of
prose, poetry, and photography
should be placed in the Ariel box
in Payne Hall by Jan, 23rd.

In a letter to the editor printed
in last week's Ring-tum Phi, it
was stated that the Ariel is the
sole legitimate vehicle for stu-
dent literary expression; we are
gratified by such support.

Jay McCann ‘77
Tav Lupton "76
Editors, Ariel

Thymes critic scored
Editer, The Ring-tum Phi:

I was amused when I read the
letters to the editors section of
the last Ringtum Phi and felt
it was my duty as a responsible
member of the Washington and
Lee student body to reply to Mr,

he had his introduction to basic
machinery, a prelude to his engi-
neering career.

Pratt for a time attended Locust
Dale Academy, a private school
in Orange, and after a year at
Randolph-Macon College he en-
tered the University of Virginia,
where he was graduated as a
civil engineer in 1905.

After graduation, Pratt had
offers to go with the EI. du-
Pont de Nemours & Co. and with
the American Bridge Co. AIl-
though the job with American
Bridge would have paid more, a
professor advised him to take the
duPont offer, because he felt it
would provide more valuable ex-
perience.

Just before Labor Day weekend
of 1905, Pratt traveled to Wilm-
ington, Del., to go to work for
the company. When he got there,
he found the place was closed for
the holiday, but he managed to
persuade a company executive to
let him remain through the week-
end and start work early.

By the time the plant opened
again, Pratt had finished figur-
ing a job the company had ob-
tained on the Delaware River and
made a favorable first impression
on company officials.

From duPont to GM

His work with duPont brought
him to the attention of Col. H.
M. Barksdale, then a high-rank-
ing duPont official who recognized
him as an exceptionally able per-
son. Barksdale sent Pratt to New
York to work closely with top
officials of the company and dur-
ing this period Pratt also travel-
ed extensively around the coun-
try selecting sites for new du-
Pont plants. Among places he
selected were two in Virginia, at
Waynesboro and an area which
grew into what is now Hopewell.

At one point, before he came
to Barksdale’s attention, Pratt
became discouraged and returned
to King George, where he taught
school about a year. But he was
persuaded to return to duPont
and from then on his star rose
meteorically.

In 1917, duPont and the fledgl-
ing General Motors associated
with one another, and from time
to time duPont executives were
made available to W. C. Durant,
General Motors president, on
special assignment.

in 1918, General Motors built
a number of homes for its em-
pioyees around Detroit, but
Durant was puzzled because al-
though the homes were well built
and priced reasonably, few em-
ployees were buying or renting
them.

He asked duPont for assistance
and Barksdale sent him Pratt,
whom he called his expert on
housing. Pratt examined General
Motors’ payroll records and work-
ed all night to boil his report
down to two paragraphs which
said, in essence, employees were
not buying or renting the homes
because they were not being paid
enough by the company to afford
them.

The simple and incisive report
so impressed Durant that he ask-
ed Pratt to go to work for him
as a special assistant, and in
December 1919 Pratt left duPont
and went to GM.

One of his assignments there
was to take care of a proposed
liquidation of the  then-infant
Frigidaire Division. Pratt went to
the Frigidaire plant in Ohio and
informed the manager the plant
was to be closed. The manager
begged him first to talk to some
people who had bought Frigi-
daires, and Pratt agreed. He visit-
ed a number of homes, and at
each stop, on informing women
he was with Frigidaire, was met
with a barrage of complaints
about the company product.

But when Pratt offered to re-
fund their money to the custom-
ers in full, all the wemen refused
the offer. He realized that despite
defects in the product, customers
who used Frigidaires would not
part with them to go back to the
old icebox, and as result the
plant was kept in operation. In
years to come, Pratt was instru-
mental in development of a better
refrigerator as well as a safe
refrigerant, Freon.

In March 1921, Pratt was named
general manager and group
executive o fthe accessories di-
vision of General Motors. He was
elected vice president in 1922
and continued in that capacity
until his retirement in 1937.

While corporation vice presi-
dent, Pratt worked from a small
office in the General Motors
building in New York and lived
at the Hotel McAlpin in a small
suite. He never worked for any
one division of General Motors
but served as an official of the
entire corporation.

Auto starter sand diesels

When World War I broke out,
Pratt tried to enlist in the service
but was rejected because of a
physical disability. One of his
most important roles with GM
was helping it acquire the Dayton
Electric Co., which in turn de-
veloped an automobile self-starter
small enough to be used feasibly
in cars. Thus the era of the hand
starter, or crank, came to an end.

Pratt was also called upon to
promote diesel engines being
made by one of the company’s
divisions. Until that time diesel
engines were used mainly in
boats, and there weren’t enough
sales to justify continued pro-
duction. Pratt persuaded Sea-
board Air Line Railway, then in
receivership, to begin using diesel
locomotives. The savings proved
to be revolutionary and soon all
major railroads were using
diesels.

Elected a director of General
Motors in April 1923, Pratt served
as a member of the company’s
executive committee from Sept.
1, 1924, to its dissolution in 1935.
He was a member of the bonus
and salary committee for a 10-
year period beginning in 1937. He
also served as a member of the
financial policy committee from
June 1946 until January 1952.

During World War Il, Pratt
served the country as an unpaid
consultant and was a moving fac-
tor in development of the Lend-
Lease Program and its adoption
by Congress. The head of Lend-
Lease, Edward Stettinius, who
had worked under Pratt at Gen-
eral Motors, was a great admirer
of Pratt and asked him to help
with the new program.

While getting Lend-Lease
organized, Pratt traveled to a
number of countries, including
England, where he met Prime
Minister Winston Churchill. Pratt
sometimes recounted to friends
that Churchill had remembered a
visit he made to Fredericksburg
in the mid-1920s.

Voluminous testimony

Pratt’s highly retentive memory
served him in good stead when
in the 1950s the government
brought its famous anti-trust act-
ion against the duPont Company
to force it to divest itself of its
holding in General Motors.

During the years of the long,
drawn-out hearings in the du-
Pont action, depositions taken
ran into the millions of words.
Pratt’s testimony alone covers
thousands of pages, since the
government contended that he
never really left duPont, but had
taken the position at General
Motors only to act on duPont’s
behalf.

In his testimony, Pratt cited
instance after instance in which
he had taken sides against du-
Pont because he felt it was best
for General Motors, His testimony
dealt with a period of nearly 50
years, yet he was able to recall
incidents which had occurred
many years before. Though du-

’Good ol’ boy’ enlivens Cockpit

By FRITZ GOLDBERG
Music Editor-at-large

Paul Carney is a good ol’ boy
from Yonkers who plays piano
and foosball. Although good ol’
boys are generally thought to be
of Southern origin, this week's
Cockpit performer fits the bill in
a grand manner.

His first set begins with a
musical invitation to the audience

THE EDITOR

Gray's letter.

I am sorry to say that Mr.
Gray lost a great deal of force
in his eritical analysis simply be-
cause he chose to approach the
Thymes from a pompous position,
tis word choice seems as weak as
that of the Thymes writers. Ex-
pressions like “journalistic mas-
turbation” and the like hardly
place the critic above the level of
the writers he abhors. Surely a
senior English Major can do bet-
ter. Perhaps some moderation
would help him in his construe-
tive eriticism.

I think Mr, Gray and | agree
when we condemn the Thymes
for its language and perhaps even
some of the relevance of its
articles. It should not be neces-
sary to use colloquial expressions
to shock the reader if the written
message is “pertinent.” Then
egein the Ring-tum Phi could
learn a lesson from the human
interest topics raised by the
Thymes to enliven its own drab
pages. Let us hope that if the
student body chooses to support
either or both of the journals,
that the editors will at least com.
form to the standards of formal
prose in enlightened and inquisi-
tive journalism

to “Get Down to the Music.” There
is a lot more reverb in the amp
than with other performers we
have seen so far on the Coffee
House Circuit, and a lot more re-
sponse from the listeners than we
saw with the SAB’s last star. The
song, like most of Carney’s stuff,
is no less than funky, and would
make good dance music if there
were enough room in the Cockpit.

After the first song, the mood
is calmed by two slower songs
“Loving You,” dedicated to the
lovers in the audience, and “I'm
So Tired,” played to the miles
Carney spent on the road Monday,
a song that unfortunately em-
ploys the worst key on a piano
that could conceivably be tuned
better.

Another song talks about New
York City and crowds in a jumpy
and comicly desperate fashion. It
is followed by a song from Car-
ney’s one album, a rather unsuc-
cessful, unpromoted flop from five

years ago. Then the intro is over,
the man is acquainted with his
audience and it is time to heed
his earlier injunction to get down
to the music.

“A little boogie song” called
“Hanging Around” begins with an
invitation to the audience to
“make a little noise.” The noise
is half-hearted and many per-
formers might be discouraged if
they asked the audience ot clap
along and got little response.
Carney is not stymied. Barring
clapping in rhythm, he asks the
audience to scream in a later song.
They do.

Carney is a performer, not an
artist, and perfectly suited to the
crowds he is likely to encounter
in the Cockpit. The schedule for
his shows is posted in several
places on campus for those who
want to come down and get down
to the music and scream along
with Carney. The SAB has got a
live one this time.

Generals victorious in tournament

By SAMMY THOMPSON

It was an exciting weekend of
sports for Washington and Lee
basketball fans. If you like close
games with a lot of action, you
shouldn’t have missed the Wash-
ington and Lee Invitational
Tourament held Friday and Satur-
day night in Doremus gym.

The Generals emerged as the
champions Saturday after beating
Lycoming College 78-75 in the
championship game. Friday night
W&L edged Lock Haven State
73-70 to enable them to meet
Lycoming in the final. Lycoming
received their berth by beating
Salisbury State 80-79 in the first
game Friday night.

Besides captain John Podgajny,
Coach Canfield shuffled around his
lineup Friday night against “The
Haven,” starting two freshmen
and two juniors, Dave Leunig,
Mike Wenke, Don Berlin and Bob
Flint. Senior Norm Kristoff saw
limited action due to a shoulder
injury received in practice.

“The Haven” proved to be a
pest in the first half of play. The
Generals won the opening tip
and took the first lead of the
game after a Wenke basket.
Podgajny contributed 8 of his
total 24 points in the first seven
minutes to keep W&L ahead. With
12:38 remaining in the half, how-
ever, Lock Haven tied it at 18 all.
Three costly W&L turnovers gave
them the lead at 24-18 a minute
later.

3ut the Generals came back
with the help of 6-2 junior Pat-
Dennis and senior Jeff Baum.

Varsity football captains chosen

Rising senior Tony Perry, one
of the top all-time pass-catchers
in W&L football history, and ris-
ing junior Jeff Slatcoff, one of the
best defensive players ever to don
a Generals’ uniform, have been
selected co-captains of the 1976
football squad.

Perry, a tight end from Waynes-

boro, Va., and Slatcoff, a line-
backer from Windber, Pa., near
Pittsburgh, were chosen in bal-
loting by squad members.

“The squad couldn't have
chosen two finer leaders,” head

coach Bill McHenry commented.
“In addition to their outstanding
athletic ability, they are totally
committed and dedicated to a job

that must be done—leading us
to a complete turnaround in
1976.”

Swimming team

Washington and Lee’s unde
feated swimming team kept its
record intact with a narrow 61-52
victory last Saturday over Vir
ginia Tech in Blacksburg. Coach
Bill Stearns’ Generals won the
last relay event of the day to
win its third meet of the year

The Generals won six individ

ual events, two of them by John
Hudson, who posted a 1:49.3 in
the 200-vard freestyle and a 4:51.8
in the 500-yard freestyle. Fresh
man Chip Hoke won the 1000
yard freestyle in 10:40.57 (the

second best time in the
year behind Hudson)

The 1975 Generals suffered
through a 1-8-1 campaign, defeat-
ing Georgetown, 28-26, in the final
game to end the season on a
happy note.

McHenry described Perry as
“the finest receiver in W&L’s
modern history,” and Slatcoff as
“the best linebacker I’ve ever
coached,”

A starter since his freshman
year, Perry has already broken
two pass-receiving records and is
within an eyelash of another. His
career records include most TD
receptions (13) and most total
yards (1557). With 123 catches,
he needs just five more next year
to become the all-time receiver
in W&L history.

Slateoff, who also has started

.

still undefeated
won the 200-yard breaststroke in
2:30.72; freshman freestyler Keith
Romich, who posted his best times
of the season in finishing second
behind Hudson in two events—a
1:51.1 in the 200-, 5:10.3 in the
500- and also a :50.5 00-yard
“split”; and Captain Rod Scott
with a pair of seconds—2:01.4 in
the 200 individual medley and
2:16.2 in the 200-yard butterfly.

The Generals face some of the
toug competition of the sea
on Friday when they travel to
Richmond to meet Virginia Com
monwealth at 4:00 p.m. They
will return to Doremus Gym to
face Davidson at 2:00 p.m. Satur-

Dennis brought the Generals back
with two straight baskets and
Baum followed with two more to
tie the score at 27-27 with 8:10
remaining.

W&L went through a moment-
ary defensive lapse, however, and
the Haven beat them under the
boards to regain their lead. The
rest of the half was a seesaw
battle as the lead changed back
and forth five times. The Generals
got the lead of a Baum jump
shot at 39-37 with one minute
and six seconds left on the clock.
Lock Haven tied it at 39-39 with
54 seconds before LSS guard Bill
Vassallo connected for two points
with 18 seconds to send the Gen-
erals to the locker room trailing
41-39.

“The Haven” outshot W&L in
the first half on free throws hit-
ting seven out of seven attempts
while the Generals shot a measly
3-9. The Generals trailed 58.6 to
40.6 per cent from the field.

W&L did not waste any time
at the start of the second half
reeling off seven straight points

before LHS could score. This
gave them a 46-41 lead with 16:50

remaining.

From then on, W&L never tail-
ed, compiling as much as an 11
pont lead at the eight minute
mark. But then “The Haven”
started coming back.

The Generals’ lead fell to three
points at 71-68 with two minutes
left. After going into a stall-
offense with a minute left, Leunig
turned the ball over when he
threw it out of bounds. W&L went
into a full-court press but could

not stop Vassallo from scoring
with twenty seconds left to nar-
row the lead to one point.

Podgajny was fouled with seven
seconds showing on the clock,
however, and the Generals’ cap-
tain converted both free throws
to secure the W&L lead. Lock
liaven had the ball long enough
afterwards to miss two field goal
attempts before the buzzer sound-
ed giving the Generals a 73-70
win.

Podgajny led the Generals in

eee

 

scoring with 24 points followed
by Leunig (11), Baum (10), Berlin
(7) and Dennis (7). Flint and
Baum led in the rebound depart-
ment with 8 apiece. Flint was also
the Generals’ leader in steals com-
ing up with five of the team’s 10
total.

Washington and Lee had
another fight-to-the-finish Satur-

day night in the championship
game of the tournament against
the Lycoming College Warriors.

Four hundred cheering W&L
fans watched the contest in which
the Generals escaped with another
narrow victory, 78-75. W&L won
the tipoff but trailed in point
totals most of the first half. Ly-
coming’s brother combination of
Jim and John DiMarco and Bill
Conroy were pesky for the Gen-
erals the entire night. John Di-
Marco, who was later selected as
one of the tournament’s all-star
guards along with John Podgajny,
got Lycoming its first lead two
minutes into the game.

After that Lycoming led most
of the first half except for a
momentary W&L lead at 19-18
with 7:45 remaining. Bob Flint
kept the Generals alive hitting 11
first-half points and grabbing five
rebounds off the boards. Chris
Larson tied the game with two
free throws at 30-30 with five sec-
onds left. Baum was fouled with
five seconds left but failed to
connect and the teams went to
intermission deadlocked with a
30-30 tie.

The second half started slowly
for the Generals but Don Berlin
started a rally with 16:58 left to

play that eventually gave them
a 47-40 lead. Berlin hit six
straight points for the Generals
and assisted on two more as W&L
turned the game arund. John
Podgajny, after a slow first half,
started connecting on his famous
jump shot and the Generals were
on the move.

Lycoming tried to stop W&L
by applying a man-to-man press
with ten minutes remaining. In
the process, Ray Riggins, one of
their leading scorers, fouled out
of the game. The Generals’ lead
fell to 52-51 with 10:19 left.
Another close finish was in the
making as Lycoming tied it at
57-57 with 7:50 and 61-61 with
6:13 remaining to play.

Podgajny and Flint proved too
much to handle for the Warriors
as they both hit shots under pres-
sure to keep the Generals’ lead
the rest of the game. Podgajny
again led in scoring with 22
points to give W&L a 78-75 win.
Flint finished close behind with
19 points and 9 rebounds to lead
in that department for W&L. Both
Flint and Podgajny were selected
as tournament all-stars and Wash-
ington and Lee, of course, won
the tournament.

The two wins, added to the 72-
67 victory over Bridgewater Col-
lege January 7, now gives the
Generals an impressive 6-3 record
and a four game winning streak.
The Generals traveled to Emory
and Henry College yesterday
(Jan. 14) and will face Virginia
Wesleyan at home Saturday at
8:30 p.m.

Pratt believed in education; established many research programs

(Continued from page 2)
Pont was subsequently made to
get rid of its GM holdings, at-
torneys on both sides were amaz-
ed at Pratt’s memory for detail.

Pratt never forgot his origins
on a King George County farm,
and he retained a love for the
soil all his life. When he pur-
chased Chatham and along with
it several other farms in Stafford
and King George, he decided to
sell the farms only to young men
who were interested in being full-
time farmers. He stuck to that
decision though he could have
gotten much more money from
the farms by selling them to
others who would not have farm-
ed them full time or would have
developed them for other pur-
poses,

Pratt’s interests were many and
diverse. Over a period of years
he provided, anonymously, schol-
arship funds of major importance
in a number of Virginia colleges
and universities and made a num-
ber of important contributions to
Johns Hopkins University in
Baltimore, which he served as
a trustee for many years. He also
gave scholarship funds to the
Virginia Museum of Fine Arts.

He took a particular interest in
research at universities and con-
tributed generously to such re-
search. When doing so he _ in-
variably gave an extra measure to
support added expenses involved

penses.

(In a 1958 letter to Dr. Gaines,
just after Washington and Lee an-
nounced its program to strengthen
facilities and programs in the
sciences, Mr. Pratt wrote: “It is
pleasing to me to see that you
are going to attempt to improve
the accommodations at Washing-

ton and Lee for the sciences.
When Russia launched their
Sputniks, they did one of the

best things for America that even
a good friend could have done:
namely, awakening us to the poor
job being done on sciences in
American schools.”’)

Pratt always believed that mem-
bers of college faculties should
be paid well for what they did,
and rather than donate money
for buildings (since it was his
theory that funds for new build-
ings were relatively easy to raise)
Pratt established funds to pay
faculty members more.

A civil engineer himself, he
often remarked he met few engi-
neers who could write a good
letter, and to help remedy that
he personally established a chair
of English in the Department of
Engineering at the University of
Virginia.

An entirely new research effort
at Johns Hopkins University had
its origins when some cattle on a
farm owned by Pratt died myst-
eriously. For several weeks he
called in exeprts who tried in

vain to discover the reason for
the deaths.

Then a cattleman who had once
farmed in Texas told Pratt the

with research efforts since, to the
delight of college administrators,
he realized that extra activity
usually generated additional ex-

Gift ‘overwhelms’ Nuckols;
Huntley terms it ‘magnificent’

(Continued from page 1)
the following remarks:

“Needless to say, I’m just delighted to hear of the gift, and as
President Huntley said to the New York Times, we are overwhelmed
and almost speechless. All weekend I have been walking around
almost floating on air—it’s just a marvelous gift and a great help
to Washington and Lee, coming at such an opportune moment.

“This is such a great boost for the Development Program. I
think it is just wonderful that Mr. Pratt would do something like
this for all the colleges involved, and particularly for private insti-
tutions, which are in such need of this type of support.

“The Board of Trustees—and the whole W&L community, for
that matter, faculty and students—are very, very grateful.”

In a comment on Mr. Pratt and on the significance of his gift
to Washington and Lee, President Robert E. R. Huntley said:

“Colleges sometimes overuse such words as ‘great’ and ‘mag-
nificent’—but I think it is objectively fair by any measure to say
that those words perhaps understate the impact of John Lee Pratt's
bequest to Washington and Lee University.

“In the same way,” Huntley said, ‘I do not think w> can over-
estimate what it has meant to us to have had his friendship, per-
sonally and institutionally—nor what it has meant to us to have
received his enthusiastic endorsement of our character, our strengths,
and our aspirations.

“Mr. Pratt was a businessman of legendary acumen; he created
his estate by means of his own talents and his own abiiities and
his own uncanny powers of judgment. And drawing on vio e formid-
able resources, Mr. Pratt judged Washington and Lee Univers.(:
and found us worthy.

“That knowledge, reflected as it is in his overwhelming benefac-
tion, is what fills our hearts and gratifies us now.

“While this gift is magnificent—and goes a long, long way
toward helping us achieve the formidable development goals we
defined as crucial some years ago—ihere remain a number o ‘sub
stantial unmet needs at Washington and Lee, the achievemeat of
which has long been imperative and remains so. It is to these press-
ing necessities that we can and must now turn our full attention.”

disease could be cleared up by
adding a tiny bit of cobalt—a
trace element—to the diet of the
COWS.

Pratt tried it and it worked
That led him to an interest in
the importance of trace elements
—or “micronutrients,” as they
are more formally called—and in
1947 he donated funds to estab-
lish the MeCollum-Pratt Institute
at Johns Hopkins for studies in
that field. McCollum was E. V.
MeCollum, a pioneer in the field
of the study of vitamins. The
institute continues today, and has
issued reports of worldwide im-
portance on micronutrients.

Although Pratt and his wife
formed a foundation, it has con-
centrated mainly on area and
Virginia philanthropies. Pratt
served on the boards of several
larger foundations over a period
of years and at one time consider-
ed establishing a large foundation
himself,

But as time went by he be-
came disillusioned with large
foundations in general, reaching
a personal conclusion that it was
wrong to perpetuate great for-
tunes long after the person who
acquired the fortune was gone.
He felt it would probably be bet-
ter to seatter such fortunes on
the death of whoever had ac-
quired them, and he took pains to
make certain the wealth he had
acquired would not be self-per-
petuating.

His worth was estimated by
Fortune magazine in the mid-
1950’s at between $100 and $200
million, but Pratt never bothered
to comment on such speculation.

Pratt’s interest in General
Motors extended to every phase
of the company’s operation. He
often spent part of the winter in
Arizona and had many friends on
the faculty of the University of
Arizona.

When he noticed that some of
his faculty friends were driving
small foreign cars, Pratt asked
them why. They responded that
the smaller cars were more eco-

nomical and were also well made.
Convinced, Pratt was among the
first to urge General Motors to
get into the small-car production.

One of Pratt’s intimate friends
was Gen. George C. Marshall,
Army chief of staff during World
War II and later Secretary of
State. Marshall and Pratt some-
times exchanged visits at each

other’s homes. Pratt helped fi-
nance the George C. Marshall

Library at Virginia Military Insti-
tute.

Willis, who handled the negotia-

that such close contact should be
maintained with the E.C, about
the use of the funds.

According to Willis, the first
contact with Baraka came dur-
ing exams and the deal was not
concluded until the end of last
week,

“IT don't know what could have
been done,” he said.

The appearance of Baraka,

‘A Salute to Hollywood’
is Fancy Dress theme

By RYLAND OWEN

The 69th Annual Fancy Dress
Weekend will be held February
26-27, according to the Student
Activities Board. The theme for
(his vear’s activities, comparative-
ly unique since it has no bicenten-
nial significance, will be “A Sa-
lute to Hollywood.” Tickets for
the weekend's activities will be

on sale the first week in February.
Each ticket will cost ten dollars
in advance and $12 at the door.
Fancy Dress Weekend will start
off with a dance at the Pavillion,
with The Marvelettes providing
the music. The dance will have
the same status as a regular com-
bo party; in other words, no for-
mal dress will be required and a

Cook asks EC for veep,
reports threatened suit

By JOE FITZGERALD
Assistant News Editor

Rodney Cook, president of the
class of °78, came before the Exe-
cutive Committee Monday night
to ask them to appoint David
Lowe, one of the two sophomore
representaives on the University
Council, to fill the seat of sopho-
more class vice-president, vacated
by the departure of David Bau-
man.

Cook asked that the E.C. ap-
point Lowe because the UC.
member has the support of the
class, as evidenced by his election
last Spring, and because he is
someone Cook says he can work
with well in the possible troubles
the sophomore class may have to
face later.

The class has been threatened
with an $1800 lawsuit from the
band who played at the Home-
coming Grain Party, a party spon-
sored by the sophomore class. The
hand members are claiming dam-
ages to their equipment and ve-
hicles.

According to Cook, the only vis-
ible damage to the band’s machi-
nery was a slashed screen on one
of the speakers. Cook also said
(hat Bauman told a member of
the band that the sophomore class

age.

Cook said he had hired a law-
yer for the class to handle the
case.. The class has $1300 in its
budget, $500 of which was left
over from last year’s funds after
the class held a Fancy Dress Grain
Party, as well as two beer parties
for the freshmen in the Spring.

The E.C. declined to favor
Cook’s request, deciding instead
to hold a special election on Feb-
ruary 2nd to fill the post.

The decision to hold an election
was one of three options discussed
by the E.C. The other choices were
to appoint someone to take the
position until the general election
on March 22nd, or to leave the
seat empty until that date.

The choice of leaving the office
vacant was at first voted in by the
E.C. but then rejected on a revote.

The option of appointing some-
one was considered but defeated
in a vote on the matter. The E.C.
decided to hold the election by a
vote of 9-2.

in effect. The dance will com-
mence at 8:30 on Thursday night.

MG damaged,
prank termed
“practical joke”

By BOB CHIAVIELLO

Over $500 worth of damage was
done to a student’s car in the
parking lot of the ZBT house dur-
ing a party Saturday night.

As a practical joke, several stu-
dents were moving the car, an MG,
when they were joined by another
group, reportedly from the SAE
house.

Students from each group be-
gan pounding on the car before
being discouraged by their more
sober companions. The car was
left with extensive damage to the
hood and sides and the owner was
left with a $512 damage bill.

The owner of the car reported
it to both student and local au-
thorities. At least one member has
been interviewed by the police.
The matter is presently being in-
vestigated by the Student Control
Committee.

The student’s father has report-
edly threatened criminal charges
if the University’s punishment is
not severe enough.

The student is frequently the
subject of practical jokes, such as
having his car placed on the side
walk. According to one of the stu-
dents involved, “He’s not very
popular as it is.”

membership in Omicron Delta
Kappa, the national leadership
society, at an assembly on Mon-
day.

Ten undergraduates and three
law students were also elected to
membership in the organization,
which was founded at W&L in
1914. Omicron Delta Kappa now
has chapters on more than 100
college campuses throughout the
nation.

The induction of the two hon-
orary members — both graduates
of Washington and Lee —and the
13 students took place at a joint
convocation marking the birthday
of Robert E. Lee and W&L’s
Founders’ Day. Dr. William W.
Pusey III, head of the German de-

partment and former dean of The
College and acting president in
1967-68, delivered the principal
address, “Robert E. Lee: The Im-
plausible Magician,” a study of
Lee’s impact on the curriculum at
Washington College during his
years as president from 1965 un-
til his death in 1870.

Dr. Pusey remarked upon the
devastating effects of the War Be-
tween the States on Washington
College. Higher education thro-
ughout the South wa sin a state of
chaos, and the college was kept
alive only through the determin-
ed efforts of its faculty. By the
time the fighting had stopped,
conditions at the school were so
bad as to cause one observer to

Wallace injury slows campaign

By PHILIP HATCHETT

In every presidential election
year Alabama Governor George
C. Wallace musters up enough
political strength to die a slow
death. And 1976 proves to be p-
exception.

Bill Brawley of the Jackson for
President campaign seemed to
speak for the majority of cam-
paign offices in Washington when
he said, “Whatever Wallace gets
in the primaries and state conven-
lions is all he can hope for; be
that his usual 15-18%. He'll start
losing delegates after that.”

But even this year’s usual grass-
roots support appears to be in jeo-
pardy. For the first time in his
political career Wallace is being
challenged for that expected 15-
18°% by fellow Southerner Jimmy
Carter and Washington Senator
Henry Jackson.

For Wallace the first big test
will come on March 2 in the Mass-
achusetts primary. Wallace is hop-
ing to cash in on the present un-
popular forced busing issue in
Boston. As Wallace said on the
day he announced his candidacy,
“The issue is of forced busing
(and) the answer to forced busing
is to stop it.”

Notice

Petitions are now being accept
ed for the position of sophomore
class vice-president Petitions
should be in the E.C. room by 7
p.m. Monday, Jan. 26. They should
have 50 signatures of persons in
the sophomore class and the can
didate must be willing to attend
the E.C. meeting this Monday
night. The E.C. wishes to make
clear that the person elected to
this position will have no legal
liahilities in any eases involving
the sophomore class

Although the Boston people are
against foreed busing, they don’t
seem to be in favor of Wallace. In
a survey of five television stations
in the Boston area, the general
consensus is that Wallace has fail-
ed to make the voters put aside
their natural liberal tendencies to
crusade against busing.

One reason for the apparent
failure in Massachusetts is the un-
satisfactory nature of the cam-
paign in the Bay State. Wallace
shifted from his standard shop-
ping center-carnival type appear-
ances to a low-key media cam-
paign with a multitude of taped
television interviews.

From the start the press has
questioned this strategy, asking
if it could be due to health rea-
sons. Since the May shooting three
and a half years ago, Wallace has
accumulated many medical com-
plications. The governor is paraly-
zed from the wasit down, making
his brittle legs susceptible to in
jury. In fact when he broke his

Applications are invited for the
positions of Freshman and Up
perelass Dormitory Counselors for
the 1976-77 academic year, These
posiiions are considered to be
wneng the most responsible en
trusted to Washington and Lee
students

On the basis of past experience,
certain guidelines for the selec
tion of Dormitory Counselors have
been established, Applicants must
be at least current sophomores,
and should not have routine com
mitments after 8:00 p.m. that
would normally take them from
the dormitory for any appreciable
time

left leg this summer, Wallace
didn’t realize it for several days.
Moreover the Alabamian suffers
from poor hearing, spasmodic
pains around the waist and the
loss of bladder control. Still his
personal doctors believe he is cap-
able of withstanding the trauma
of a campaign and the pressures
of the office he pursues.

To counter the persistent health
question, Wallace is changing his
campaign style for his second
major hurdle. Last week Wallace
initiated a schedule of 25 personal
appearances in Florida before the
March 9 primary. Wallace captur-
ed 42° of the vote in '72 but that
phenomenon will be hard to dup-
licate. Jimmy Carter will spend a
total of 45 days in the state com-
pared to the 20-22 days by Wal-
lace. However the governor still
expects a majority of delegates.

This time around the Wallace
campaign staff knows the dele-
gate selection rules. That misin-

sets were a long and distinguish-
ed history, and a picturesque land-
scape.

Gen. Lee’s acceptance of the
college’s presidency, according to
Pusey, caused the most startling
and dramatic turnaround in the
school’s history. Enrollment shot
up as young men from all over
the South were attracted by the
prestige afforded by Lee's pres-
ence. Many changes and innova-
tions were instituted, many of
them authored by Lee himself and
all of them bearing his unmis-
takable influence and stamp of
approval.

Dr. Pusey listed some of Gen.
Lee’s notable accomplishments,
including: nine separate schools
of study, with a limited program
of electives; five new professor-
ships; merging with a local law
school: expansion of the business
school to include agriculture,
chemistry, and commerce, and the
hiring of several graduate assis-
tants. Particularly remarkable,
noted Dr. Pusey, were Lee’s pro-
gram of scholarships to local men
in pursuit of journalistic train-
ing, and his abolishment of man-
datory Chapel attendance.

Pusey gave several reasons for
the University’s steep decline af-
ter Lee's death. The emergence of
other Southern colleges, the new
emphasis on scholarship and re-
search at new schools like Johns
Hopkins, and the lack of involve-
ment on the part of President
Custis Lee led to a faculty and
student exodus, and the conse-
quent decline in revenues left the
University in a state of depres-
sion for many years.

Following Pusey's remarks, th»
new members of ODK were call-
ed forward for recognition.

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Executive buffoonery

There are times when we wonder whether the members of
the Executive Committee have ever read the Student Body
Constitution. There are even times when we wonder if the

comes vacant during the school year, and if so, how should

can read, but that is not the subject here. The subject is
is required to fill an elective office that be-

they go about filling it.

The question came up Monday night at the i.C. meeting
when Rodney Cook, president of the sophomore class, reported
that David Bauman, vice-president of that class, had left the
University. Cook asked that the E-.C. appoint one of the sopho-
more University Council representatives to the position for the
remainder of the year.

The decision of what to do about the vacancy might have
been easy to resolve if not for two factors: the v.p. of each
class is a member of the Student Control Committee, and the
band that played the Homecoming Cocktail Party in Red
Square is threatening to sue the sophomore class for damage
done to their equipment and vehicles during the party.

The question led to a parliamentary quagmire. Jim Under
hill moved that the E.C.
stitution and appoint someone to fill the post until the general
March 22.
Pugh moved that the E.C

invoke Article 5 section f of the Con
election on His motion was defeated and Bobby
_ for the first time in recorded his
tory, do nothing. The vote in favor of doing nothing was five
to three with three abstentions. This led to quibbling over
whether that was a legal margin in favor of inactivity, and
by the time the E.C. decided that the vote was sufficient, Jim
Underhill had called for a revote, which defeated the motion,
which led to a motion to hold a general election on Feb. 2,
which led Mynders Glover to ask if they were just going to
appoint some “buffoon” to fill the office, which led Gary Sel
domridge to speak up and say that the Student Control Com
mittee did not want just any buffoon joining its ranks, which
led Bobby

It is a pity no one made such a decision about the [.¢

last Spring. For over an hour the gentlemen wrangled back

of authority,” (never mind that they are in charge of appointing
and members of student committee) and

Bobby Pugh mentioning that “It would be nice to have the
class choose” their own vice-president. Pugh later added, “I
don't like sophomores anyway.’

One would have to have seen the debate to appreciate the
true farcical quality of the proceedings, which proved one
again that while this lofty board is perfeetly capable of givin

away money to damn near anvone who asks for it, en a real

problem arises the I.C, is likely to be caught with its khaki
down, wondering why General Lee did not put anything
about this in his memoirs.

“May I help you?”

“Yes, I’d like a ‘Bagpipe’.”

“All right, that'll be $1.40.”

“May I help you?”

“I'd like a ‘Mombo’.”

“That'll be $1.35.”

A “Bagpipe”? “Mombo”? No,
it is not Scotland or some distant
planet with some bizarre langu-
age. It is the Palm Parlor Ice
Cream Cafe on the corner of
Jefferson and Nelson streets.

Up two steps and suddenly
enter the Victorian era with
palms and ferns (including a big
100-year-old Boston fern in one
corner), two fans hanging from
the ceiling, a row of six hanging
globe lights and a shiny wood
plank floor.

But that’s not all. There are
bamboo curtains over the win-
dows and on the back wall, a row
of early 20th century pictures on

one, several small round
wooden tables accompanied by
four metal parlor-type chairs

apiece, two snuff advertisements
and finally a display of the ice
cream at least 25 flavors.
Among these delectables are cho-
colate chunk, rum raisin, rainbow
and dutch apple, to name a few.

Behind the counter is a huge
mirror surrounded by an extrava-
gant wooden frame (only adding
to the turn of the century-late Vic-
torian atmosphere), On the count-
er is a stack of hand printed me-
nus. Inside is a list of sandwiches
(among these, a “Dagwood” and
“Coney Dogs”) and ice cream
creations including the aforemen-
tioned “Bagpipe” and “Mombo”
as well as a “Black Cow,” an “Am-
brosia Shake” (“shake of the
gods”), a “Bicentennial Parfait”
and a “Georgetowner.”

Behind the counter stand one
or two of the seven employees.
One may be a short 23-year-old
man with sandy blond collar-
length wavey hair and a thick
matching beard. He’s Doug Hig-
gins, a °73 VCU graduate and the
Palm Parlor owner.

Higgins received a degree in
art, was a substitute teacher in
Richmond for about six months
and traveled “from Nova Scotia to
the Keys” before settling down in
the ice cream business in Lexing-
ton.

He chose Lexington to set up his
business because his grandmother
(the contributor of the 100-year-
old Boston fern) lives here and his

father came from here. Besides,
“T just wanted to get away from
big cities,” he said.

The Palm Parlor opened Aug.
4. Higgins said the transition from
Ray Miller’s “Den of Antiquities”
to the Palm Parlor took about
two months.

It was an expensive project. Ac-
cording to Higgins, the initial re-
novation cost the most, but the
restaurant equipment ran a close
second.

Higins selected the turn-of-the-
century-late-Victorian atmosphere
because “that’s when ice cream
was in its hey day. It was big busi-
ness, as American as the Ameri-
can flag, you know, the national

%,

pastime — the whole bit.’

Higgins said the business is do-
ing well. The Parlor is breaking
even now but Higgins said that it
will enter the profit-making stage
soon.

By the way, a “Bagpipe” con-
sists of “butter pecan, vanilla and
black walnut ice cream covered
with butterscotch and marshmal-
low and crowned with mounds of
whipped cream and a cluster of
crushed pecans.” A ‘“Mombo’’ is
simply a “scoop of banana and va-
nilla ice cream laced with rasp-
berry and chocolate topping, toast-
ed almonds and our own ‘Jamai-
can Magic’ with whipped cream
and cherries.”

The title of this column is not
an attempt to plagiarize the title
of a Chicago song. It is an at-
tempt to capture the scope of the
Mock Convention, an event where-
by three and a half years of
planning goes into spending 32,-
000 dollars in 48 hours.

The column will be a regular
feature of the Ring-tum Phi be-
tween now and May. It’s purpose
is to keep an eye on the progress
of the preparaitons for the Mock
Convention, and to answer any
questions our readers may have
about the quadrennial game of
political prediction. Persons hav-
ing questions about the Mock
Convention or comments on this
column should drop them by the
Ring-tum Phi office on the ground
floor of Reid Hall. Just drop them
in the box marked Edit/Opin.

The personnel of the Athletic
Department must have bad dreams
every night about the idea of
well over a thousand people Mock
Convening on a very expensive
basketball court this Spring. Their
fears are especially comprehen-
sible when one considers that the
1972 convention saw more than
a few of the delegates imbibing
to excess and to several other
distant points on the precious
hardwood.

The thrill of victory...

By MICHAEL FERRARA

My heart starts beating faster,
and soon my breathing resembles
that of a pregnant cow in labor.

Sight becomes blurred, and my
flat feet and flabby legs feel like

brars mind quits long before

how stupid they are for going
around in circles just for the ex

mountable pressures of society

have compelled me to run.

Experiencing severe physical
pain is part of life, and I was first
exposed to it in High School. (The
track was called the “loop,” as op
posed to the “super loop,” which
longer and dreaded by the
whole student body). To me it was
self-inflicted torture. I devised
many excuses to avoid the daily
run in the gym, once contracting
poison ivy for the sole purpose of
bein absolved from running
When the unthinkable finally did
happen, I usually hid behind the

In my freshman year in
School, I gathered enough
age to join the soccer team. Little
did I know that the team ran
more than it plaved. I used to get
sick to my stomach just thinking
about the three laps we had to run
each day. After we had finished
running, the team had to hear the

minutes, After I read that, the
rest of my summer was not quite
the same. I was determined to
pass the test the first time and
underwent a vigorous (for me)
training program. I went to the
track every morning from that
day on, trying to run at least a
mile a day. I usually ended up
walking at least half that amount.

Convention, there wil be no such
problems during this year’s
event. Besides the damage that
might be done to the facilities,
there is also the effect that
alcohol might have on the dele-
gates’ determination for accuracy.
Wolf (as well as the _ political
chairman for the ’72 MC) specu-
lated that the MC making its first
wrong choice in 24 years in '72
may have been due to an inability
to concentrate on political matters
in the jovial atmosphere that pre-
vailed on the floor. People may
have chosen Kennedy just to get
the thing over with.

While Wolf agreed with my
belief that drinking is one of the
fun parts of the Mock Conven-
tion, he said people will have to
be more discreet about it this
time. There will be tighter se-
curity on the floor, a whole squad
of Mock Secret Servicemen, pre-
sumably out-of-season football
jocks with no tests coming up,

not to prosecute him, that he may

dent of the Student Body shall be

He “shall be permitted to re-

mittee hearing except the delib-

The MC people may also print
up some silk-screen T-shirts for
general consumption, both to
raise money and to help with the
job of getting students interest-
ed in the Mock Convention. One
has to wonder what will go on
these T-shirts that will gather
the attention of the student body
and make them wear the things.
The Mock Convention logo might
work but it looks too much like
the American flag, and wearing
the Stars and Stripes went out
when “Easy Rider” made its last
theater run.

Perhaps they could take a cue
from the ’72 convention and re-
print a panel from “O Wicked

waist deep in water, grinning,

spreading his arms to the masses,
and wearing a button saying “76.”

Although Black Awareness Week went by without the fanfare seen
in past years, the Black Ball (above) was as vigorous as ever. The
annual tribute to Black culture this year included William Syp-

former Leroi Jones, a poet, dram atist, and author.

Baum, Flint, Podgajny lead in win

By SAMMY THOMPSON

For all of you sports fans who
were somewhere other than the
W&L basketball game Saturday
night, The Generals won their
sixth straight game by beating
Virginia Wesleyan 77-62 and are
now tied with them for first place
in VCAA league competition.

Head Coach Verne Canfield cre
dits Jeff Baum, Bob Flint and cap-
tain John Podgajny as the reason
for the Generals’ latest success.

Canfield had plenty of good
things to say about Baum, a 6-5
senior from Carlisle, Pa. “He has
added mobility and has played
good defense,’ Canfield — said.
Baum is one of the leading re-
bounders on the team.

“Flint has been the most con-
‘istent player for us.” Canfield
said. “He has some of the best
inside moves on the team.” Flint

is the team’s leading rebounder
and is also the team leader in
steals.

Podgajny has provided good
leadership and is the most accur-
ate shooter on the team, Canfield
said.

The Generals have had to play
without the services of two key
players lately in Norm Kristoff
and Bob Forlenza. Kristoff has not

seen action since January 9 and
Forlenza was just recently injur-
ed in practice.

3ut this year’s depth has aided
the Generals so far. Canfield not-
ed, however, that W&L basically
has a very young team. Freshmen
starters Mike Wenke and Dave
Leunig attribute to this fact.

Saturday night the “Blue Mar-
lins” from Virginia Wesleyan were
totally outplayed by W&L. After
trailing 8-6 early in the game,
Chris Larson came off the bench
and scored 8 straight points to
give the Generals the lead for
good.

W&L took a 9-point lead with
7:16 left after three straight bas-
kets by Podgajny, Kim Sims and
Don Berlin. The Generals’ defense
merits special credit in the first

Wrestlers post
win over H-S

The wrestling team increased
its season record to 4-2 with a 44-5
drubbing of Hampden-Sydney and
a 29-10 loss to George Mason in
action last week.

The Generals scored five pins in
easily outdistancing Hampden-
Sydney. Pinning their opponents
for W&L were Howdy Knipp at
126, Lee Keck at 134, Graham
Hudgins at 142, Andy King of
Buena Vista at 150 and heavy-
weight Dan Kniffen. Scoring de-
cisions were Kevin McFadden of
Lexington at 167 and Rick Held-
rich at 177.

King also posted a superior de-
cision against his George Mason
opponent with an 11-3 decision,
while McFadden pulled out an 8-7
come-from-behind win at 150 and
Kniffen won at heavyweight, 8-2.

Keck and Kniffen have the best
overall records for W&L with 5-1
records, while close behind are
King and McFadden (both 4-1) and
team captain Jim Crytzer, 4-1-1.

half as Virginian Wesleyan scored
only 20 points. Canfield said four
different defenses were used in
the game which might have
thrown the Marlins out of bal-
ance.

The Generals wound up the
first half by holding Virginia Wes-
leyan scoreless for the last four
minutes while reeling off ten
straight points. This gave W&L a
38-20 half time lead.

Virginia Wesleyan hit only 32
per cent of their first-half field
goals compared to 53 per cent for
W&L. The Generals were a per-
fect 6-6 in free throws and wound
up 11-12 in the game. Chris Lar-
son jed the Generals’ scoring at-
tack in the half with 8 points
while Baum led in rebounds with
5. Mike Wenke played an excel-
lent half with 4 steals and 3 as-
sists.

The start of the second half saw
the Generals increase their lead to
20 points after a Podgajny hot
streak scoring three baskets in as
many attempts. The biggest mar-
gin was 22 points, however, at
12:25 after a layup by Art Col-
lins.

Canfield substituted freely after
that and the W&L lead fell slight-
ly. Butch Sheppard and Del Bat-
tle were hard to stop for W&L as
they scored 19 and 14 points re-
spectively. The Marlins started
coming back the last five minutes
of the game but it was too late.

The Generals held on for a 15-
point 77-62 win.

The Generals had three men in
double figures as Podgajny and
Larson each had 14 points while
Baum had 10. Bob Flint added 9
points and 5 rebounds. Mike Wen-
ke ended the game with 6 points,
6 steals and 4 assists for a fine de-
fensive effort. W&L shot a little
better than 50 per cent from the
field and only missed one free
throw in 12 attempts .

Canfield was satisfied after the
Generals’ victory but admitted
that the team’s best effort of the
year came last Wednesday in their
victory over Emory and Henry
College. The team’s record now
stands at 8-3.

There are still 15 games re-
maining in the Generals’ schedule
including four important contests
against Hampden-Sydney, Old Do-
minion, Madison, and Randolph-
Macon. Yesterday W&L traveled
to Eastern Mennonite College and
will face Hampden-Sydney Satur-
day afternoon at 2 p.m.

Spring football banned by NCAA

Washington and Lee’s annual
Spring Football Game, a popular
“good time” for athletic alumni,
was a victim of NCAA legislation
last week.

Swimmers take first loss

W&L swimming star John Hud-
son vastly improved his nation-
leading times in two events as the
Generals split a pair of meets last
week.

Iludson remained undefeated in
his specialties, the 500-yard and
1000-yard freestyles, as W&L
dropped its first meet of the sea-
son to strong Virginia Common-
wealth, 68-45 ,and then defeated
Davidson, 51-42. Hudson posted a
9:54.0 in the 1000, which is 9.3
seconds faster than any other col-
lege division swimmer in the coun-
try. His 4:45.93 in the 500 is 5.8
seconds ahead of anyone else in
the college division.

Tad Van Leer remained unde-
feated in the 50-yard freestyle as

he beat the defending state cham-

Richmond. He also won the 100-

Van Leer and Hudson teamed
with Keith Romich and Gary Sel-
domridge to post a 3:20.6 in the
400-yard freestyle relay, which
ranks third nationally among
Division III schools.

Association (NCAA), in its annual
meeting in St. Louis, voted to
abolish spring football practice for
Division III schools. W&L tradi-
tionally concluded its spring foot-
ball practice with the annual Var-
sity-Alumni Game, which drew
scores of former football players
back to the campus for the event,
which included a post-game ban-
quet and social function.

The legislation also works an
unfair advantage for Division III
schools which play Division II
teams in football, since spring
practice was retained for Divisions
I and Il. W&L has two such op-
ponents in its schedule next sea-
son, Gettysburg and Millersville.

W&L also was affected by an-
other NCAA vote, to rescind team
squad limits and travel restric-
tions. The University has had such
limits of its own for many years,
but the NCAA ones—hastily pass-
ed at last year’s NCAA national

convention — were much more
strict.

W&L athletic director William
D. McHenry attended the NCAA
meeting in St. Louis and voted
against the ban on spring football
practice and for the lifting of the
travel and squad restrictions.

“We haven't yet received noti-
fication of all the changes that
took place in St. Louis,’ McHenry
commented, “but the abolition of
spring football practice and the
squad and travel limitations are
the ones that affect us most direct-
yy”

In clarifying his vote on spring
football practice, McHenry said
“I favor abolition of all out-of-
season practices for all sports,
and I feel that it is discriminatory
to ban spring practice for just one
division in football, while allow-
ing the other two divisions to con-
tinue their practices.”

Dining Hall manager Jerry Darrell wanted to do somaihing to include everyone eating in the Commons
in the SuperBowl. So Saturday night he set up a box and told people to predict the score of the game.
The winner was to win ten dollars. The only problen with the winner was there were three of them.
Darrell had said that in case of multiple winners, the money would be divided equally, but rather than
iry dividing a penny into thirds, he decided to give each winner five dolars. Pictured, from left to right,
are Darrell, Mike Powell, the box, Harold Royal, and Harold Fung.

Gordon reveals
production idea
for ‘Peer Gynt’

By GRAY COLEMAN

Dr. Albert Gordon, Fine Arts
Caairman and drama_ professor,
recently announced the final plans
for the six-week Spring Theatre
Program, The featured presenta-
(ion will be Henrik Ibsen’s Peer
Gynt, a romantic-fantasy-epic.

“This will be a totall) new
concept in drama for the W&L
heatre,” Gordon commented. “It
will be completely staged and
produced outdoors, in a natural
theatre setting—the ruins of an
old lime kiln just a bit out of
town on Lime Kiln Road. This
ea has been used once before

a theatre stage, during the
vell-remembered Lexington civic
production of Shakespeare’s A
Midsummer Night's Dream in
1967. Not only were a large num
ber of townspeople involved then
but passing airplanes were re
routed to avoid noisy interfer-
ence during the show.”

The play will be entirely staged
and produced by the Total Theatre
tudents of Drama 139. Perform
ance dates are May 26, 27, and 28
and anyone interested about work

wasting your time putting them
on the freshman or law dorms.”

In other business, Scott Frank-
lin suggested that E.C. members
and others using the Student
Center begin swearing out war-
rants on local youngsters who are
causing problems in the Center
at night.

sill Webster suggested that the
problem could be handled by a
student “police committee,” a
group students

of who would

patrol the halls of the Student
Center at night and eject un-
wanted visitors.

Webster’s suggested committee
would also help with control of
traffic problems at the Mock Con
vention parade this Spring and
would act year-round as a go-be-
tween to help with communica-
tions problems between W&L stu-
dents and Lexington Police.

Law school ready

The structure of Washington
and Lee’s new law building, Lewis
Hall, has been essentially com-
pleted, and work now concen-
trates principally on finishing the
interior and landscaping. W&L
expects to begin moving into the
121,000-square-foot, $7-million
facility this spring, and it will be
ready for classes in September.

Construction of the building is
supported by the $9-million gift
in 1972 from Frances and Sydney
Lewis of Richmond, for whom it
is named. Mr. Lewis, a W&L
graduate and trustee, is president
and board chairman of Best
Products Ine., the catalogue-show-
room retail chain; Mrs. Lewis is
executive vice president of Best.

The building, located just to
the west of the long-developed
Front Campus area, will also
contain some of the nation’s most
sophiticated facilities for law
study and legal research.

Every student will have his or
her own office-type study area,
connected electronically to a cen-
tral audio-visual “media control

REVIEWandOUTLOOK Criticism and Comment

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Thursday, January 29, 1976

Are closed faculty
meetings necessary?

Recently we were admonished by a member of the faculty
for alleged inaccuracies in our editorial column on January 8
dealing with the abolishment of the Washington Holiday.
We were told that our observations were superficial and seem-
ed to indicate a basic ignorance of what really occurred at
the December faculty meeting.

We could argue that the
faculty meetings may be incomplete or even unintentionally
misleading on occasion—of necessity we receive our facts
through second-hand accounts of the proceedings. No students
are allowed to sit in on faculty meetings.

Faculty meetings are among the most important gather-
ings that occur on this campus, and each meeting produces
something that will affect some student in some way. It is
the obligation of the student media to report on these gather-
ings, in which students may have such a vital interest. But if

information we receive on

the meetings are to be reported on factually and responsibly,
an arrangement better than the current one needs to be made.
Why must we gain our knowledge of actions taken by the
faculty through secondary sources? Why cannot faculty
meetings be open to the public?

We realize that there are times and there are issues that
should not be acted upon while under the scrutiny of student
observers. In matters such as when specific students are
discussed, the faculty could go into closed session, in a manner
similar to that used by the student Executive Committee.

The point might be raised that students would observe
how various professors vote on specific matters. Fine. If
faculty members are really concerned about how students
think of them (which is doubtful in many cases), then they
will vote on delicate issues with more care and judgment.

It might be pointed out that the coverage given by student
media to open faculty meetings would be biased. Perhaps.
But then again, the coverage given at present is biased, toward
the faculty's point of view. We are only allowed to know
what that body chooses to release through its spokesman.

Perhaps we should not raise this issue. Perhaps we should
be content with the way things are set up at present. But
somehow we get the feeling that students should have the
right to know what the faculty-—-whose decisions in academic
and other matters affect us all—is doing in those mysterious
meetings on the first Monday of each month.

A tale of the Tux

The Student Activities Board has announced its plans for
Fancy Dress ‘76, as reported in last week's Ring-tum Phi. This
year’s gala ball will attempt to recreate the mood of the Holly-
wood of a bygone era, when the Gables and Harlows and
Bogarts reigned supreme at the State and the Lyric.

Last year’s Fancy Dress was a grand success, with 1,000
couples in attendance, yet the S.\.B. made a series of con-
cessions which disturbed us at the time. Initially Faney
Dress '75 was to have been a Black Tie affair; under limited
student pressure, the board downgraded the formal dance from
Black Tie to Suit Required. Still finding itself facing opposi-
tion, the board denigrated the event further, to Coat and
Tie status.

We hope that the current Student Activities Board ex-
hibits more backbone than its predecessor if it is confronted
by those students who prefer a minimal dress requirement,
Last year more than 90% of those who attended were in
formal attire (through no small effort on the part of our local
clothiers, who cut the rental fees on their tuxedos greatly ).

The S.A.B. plans a variety of activities which appeal to
different segments of the student body, from events for lovers
of rhythm and blues to shows for vulgarity aficionados. Faney
Dress is geared toward those of us who enjoy stepping out
in grand style on rare occasions, and who appreciate secing
our female companions in something other than blue jeans
and peasant blouses,

lhe past two years have seen Faney Dress slowly pull it-
self from the pit into whieh it had fallen, and begin the slow
ascent back into the limelight as the collegiate social event of
the Valley. Let's not compromise the spirit of the weekend,
but let's keep the dress truly fancy.

Sophomore class told
of threatened legal suit
by Homecoming band

To The Sophomore Class:

As of now, it is very possible
that the Sophomore Class may be
sued by “The Devil’s Workshop,”
the band we employed during
Homecoming. It is also possible
that I will be sued personally. It
is legally difficult to sue a ‘‘sopho-
more class” and my signature is
on the contract. Their total is
$1400 which they claim will pay
for damaged equipment and cars.
An extra $400 is being charged
to us by “Devil’s Workshop” for
rented equipment. The only dam-
age I saw was a speaker with a
ripped screen. The band managed
to play our entire engagement
and at a fraternity party later
that night.

The band leader started calling
me at six o’clock and seven o’clock
in the morning, starting in late
October, demanding his money.
I went to Dean Noell and he
thought it would be wise to get
a lawyer. On this advice, I then
went to Leland McCullough who
directed me to Thomas Spencer,
the lawyer for the Executive Com-
mittee. He has since been in touch
with the band leader several
times. He says that if they sue,
our chances would be about fifty-
fifty. My lawyer in Atlanta says
I should expect to be sued myself.

Also this term Dave Bauman
did not return to W&L. This
leaves us without a Vice-President
at a time when we need one most.
I requested the E.C. to appoint
a Vice-President until the next
election in March. I thought the
logical temporary choice would
be David Low. Running for the
University Council he received
the most votes in a field of five.
He is also familiar with the case
and has met the lawyer.

The E.C. decided to have an
election which has left the class
without a Vice-President for an
extra two weeks. I was trying to
act in the best interest of the
class as quickly as I could.

The Sophomore Class Treasury
now stands at $1,300.00. We have
paid for everything we need to
this year, and this remaining
money can be spent on anything
we want, should we not be sued.
This would easily pay for two
or three parties in the spring such
as the ones we had last year, still

in the Treasury for our Junior
year. We have now started paying
Mr. Spencer, our lawer. He has
asked for a $100.00 retainer which
is normal in any type of case. We
have also incurred an additional
$25.00 legal bill for Mr. Spencer’s
communications with the band and
his legal research on the case.
As the case develops I will keep
you informed through the Ring-
tum Phi.

The election for the Vice-Presi-
dent will be held on Monday.
Please vote for the man you
think most qualified for the job
at this time.

Rodney Cook
President of the
Sophomore Class

J.G.F.’s editorial cited
as “obtuse,” “abysmal

failure” by E.C. rep.
Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

W&L has indeed come to a
pitiable state of affairs when a
reporter is so obtuse that he can-
not differentiate between a humor-
ous remark and a serious state-
ment. Let me try to educate
J.G.F. about the difference:

1) I did not mean to imply that
some Student Control Committee
members are buffoons. I voted for
and supported all of the seniors.
I count (counted?) the other mem-
bers as close personal friends. I
would have made the same re-
mark in just about any other
organization (including the E.C.)
if there was no possibility of my
being taken seriously. This quali-
fication obviously does not in-
clude the Phi.

2) 1 like sophomores. Many of
them are (were?) my good friends.
There were also several factual
inaccuracies and misleading sate-
ments, a common occurence in
J.F.F.’s articles as well as edi-
torials.

1) I did not move that the E.C.
“do nothing.” I suggested that we
wait until the March class elec-
tion, and appoint the victor of
that contest as interim Vice Presi-
dent.

2) Scott Franklin contended that
the E.C. should not appoint a
student to fill an elected position
when more than half the year
remained. This is obviously not
the same thing as choosing a stu-
dent for an appointed position.
The sophomore class certainly de-
serves to choose their Vice Presi-

leaving several hundred dollars dent.

Lemmings managed to insult
nearly everyone at show

By RYLAND OWEN

“Is nothing sacred?” Doubtless,
at some time during the evening
last Friday, this question was
posed by nearly everyone in at-
tendance at The National Lam-
poon Show. The answer was an
unmistakably obscene “no.” The
six-member cast performed a vari-
ety of skits, songs, and uniquely
choreographed numbers, with
sometimes a dash, and more often
an overdose, of vulgarity and
profanity.

Audience reaction to the skits
was usually mixed. Those familiar
with National Lampoon Magazine
were surely braced for the bom-
bardment of explicit language
and gesticulations hurled at the
audience for almost two hours.
Yet a significant number of specta-
tors obviously underestimated the
Lampoon's passion for the offen-
sive; these people, some more
tolerant than others, made up the
small stream of disgusted onlook-
ers who left the performance after
particularly scurrilous skits.

But the performers were con-
fident, almost arrogant, in the
way they rattled off extremely
vulgar lines without the slight-
est hesitation. Frequently, the
audience was barely able to react
to one nasty punchline before be-
ing subjected to another merci-
less parody.

Among the more distasteful ma-
terial was a reference to the
infirmities of Karen Ann Quinlan
and Betty Ford, as well as a highly
sacrilegious crucifixion scene

There were also several
sketches which, in addition to
being terribly obscene, were

monotonous and uninteresting. A
rather disguesting discussion of
female anatomy among a group
of housewives dragged on and on,
quickly reaching the point of
ludicrousness.

Still, the evening had its high
points. A musical number en-
titled “Prison Farm” was an ex-
cellent satire on the comfortable
life of the Watergate conspira-
tors. A superficial interpretation
of Dostoevskis The tdiot also

earned a few good chuckles. Sur-
prisingly, a splendid take-off on
the typical Jewish night club
comedian did not get a favorable
response from the audience, even

though it was tastefully done.
This stand-up comic routine and
a cynical appeal to all plant
lovers were probably the best
skits of the show.

3) Although he began his
column by excoriating us for al-
legedly not reading the Student
Body Constitution, J.G.F. never
deigned to enlighten us about the
correct interpretation. Actually,
the wording does not mandate
election or appointment.

In general, the editorial was
replete with glib generalities,
while missing the most important
point of the whole affair. J.G.F.
apparently could not comprehend
the absurdity of the Sophomore
President’s request. Cook wanted
the E.C. to appoint one of his
friends as Vice President without
the formality of any hearings,
interviews, or other selection pro-
cedures. The sophomore class and
the Phi could indeed be dis-
mayed had the E.C. chosen so
dictatorial a course. Instead, we
concentrated on deciding the tim-
ing of a new election. The dis-
cussion at times waxed humorous
because several of us prefer a
healthy cynicism and a little
humor to the pomposity and
ridiculous formality which often
pervades student government
organizations.

As an incisive and perceptive
editorial worthy of the attention
of its readers, J.G.F.’s effort was
an abysmal failure. As an example
of worthless reporting, quoting
out of context, and attempted
character assassination, the edi-
torial is a masterpiece worthy of
inclusion in a journalism text-
book.

Robert Pugh
Class of 1976

Healthy cynicism and a little
humor is indeed preferable
to pomposity and ridiculous
formality. Cynicism to the point
of absurdity and humor which
insults others is not.

Article condones crime
in secretary’s opinion;
dislike of “‘alternative

reporting style’’ aired
Jan. 22, 1976
To the Editor and Bob Chiaviello:
This week there is an article
in the Ring-tum Phi about student
vandals who caused $500.00 dam-
age to a fellow student’s car. Your
newspaper treats this incident as
if it were a humorous human in-
terest story. It isn’t funny that
students are vandals—no one is
amused. In fact, I am disgusted
that vou would report the incident
and then brush it off by saying
that the victim involved is “not
very popular as it is.” (That is
really adding insult to injury
and is not newsworthy.) You
must not condone these illegal
actions—yet the Ringtum Phi
repeatedly makes light of stu-
dents who are caught stealing
from Mother's Restaurant or who
are drunk and damage vroperty.
Bob Chiaviello says in a letter
to the Editor this week that
former contributors to the
Thymes will now take part in the
more established campus publica-

tions—‘“hopefully in that way the
University can benefit from some
new ideas.” Thanks, Bob, but re-
porting acts of vandalism and
then pinning them on the victim
because of his personality is a
bad “idea.”

I notice you always run quota-
tions from the WHITE BOOK on
page two. What good does it do?
The Honor Code is a joke as long
as you make light of the serious
crimes that students commit.

Why don’t you ever name the
victims and offenders in these
cases? After all you are a news-
paper! You should report the
nows in full—rather than _hint-
ing at it—like a gossip column.

Jan Shivel

Names were omitted in the
article, not because we prefer
to report news like gossip
items, but because the incident
is under investigation by the
Executive Committee in regard
to a possible Honor Violation.
The uncomplimentary reference
to the student whose car was
damaged exhibited a poor lack
of judgment on our part, and
we apologize for it. In any case,
we do not condone vandalism
or theft, as you insinuate.

Inter-Varsity explained
Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

As a new organization on
campus, Inter-Varsity faces the
same misconceptions of its pur-
pose and activities that any new
campus organization confronts.
One of the two most frequent
misconceptions about Inter-Var-
sity stems from the name itself.
Inter-Varsity Christian Fellow-
ship is a national organization
that had its origin at Cambridge
University, England, about a cen-
tury ago. Inter-Varsity is the
British term meaning “between
Universities” —as the Cambridge
movement soon spread to other
campuses—although the name to-
day is usually tied to athletics.
The other most common mis-
conception is that the campus
Inter-Varsity chapter is a club
open to members only. However,
anyone who is interested in at-
tending chapter meetings is in-
vited and welcome to come.

The purpose of 1-V is to pro-
vide a meeting time on campus
for Christians. There is singing
accompanied by acoustical guitar
in addition to frequent speakers
and small group discussion which
attemp! to help a student better
understand his faith and to relate
his commitment to his personal
circumstances and to contempor-
ary society in general. In fulfilling
these functions. an |-V chapter
secks to keep the Christian posi
tion open on campus as a live
option from which to choose.

For further information about
Inter-Varsity or its activilies, con-
tact me or look for weekly an-
nouncements posted around
campus.

Tav Lupton °76

THE RING-TUM PHI

Generals squeeze by H-S_ Tigers 72-71

By SAMMY THOMPSON

Washington and Lee’s basketball
Generals won two games last
week, improving their record to
10-3 and giving them sole pos-
session of first place in VCAA
competition.

But the two victories did not
come easy for W&L as one game
went into double overtime and
both games were won by only
one point.

In a game played last Wednes
day against Eastern Mennonite
College, the Generals battled
against a team that had won only
one game this year and won
in the second overtime period,
70-69. And even then the victory
came with no time showing on
the clock as Bob Flint hit a free
throw to give W&L the win.

Head coach Verne Canfield said
the Generals played poorly and
gave credit to the opponents for
a fine effort.

Wrestlers

By KEN MASTRILLI
The W&L wrestling team had a
chance to knock off the Keydets

of V.M.L for the first time in
years at a meet last Wednesda)
night in the V.M.I. Fieldhouse

rhey looked like they were going
to do it until the Keydets swept
the last four weight classes, show-
ing that they were not to be out
don by their civilian neighbors.
The final score was 28-18, but the
Generals were ahead at one point
during the event by a score of
18-16. W&L’s only pin of the meet
was accomplished by Kevin Mec
Fadden, who pinned his man
ith 1:48 left in the first period.

Jimmy Crytzer scored a decisive
decision over his opponent by a
score of 12-

The Generals bounced back last
Saturday for a very strong show
ne in the Citadel Invitational
Tournament, finishing up in third
place in a very impressive six
team field. Coach Gary Franke’s
wrestlers were just edged for the
runner-up spot by hosting team
Citadel. Pembrok won the over
all title with 85 3/4 points, fol

lowed by the Citadel with 66!

~

Saturday in Doremus Gym W&L
took on the Tigers of Hampden-
Sydney, who were 9-3 going into
the game. The Tigers had two of
the VCAA’s leading scorers in
Dick Ponti and Ed Tiernan. Ponti
hurt the Generals with 26 points
but Tiernan only got five points
and fouled out of the game with
three minutes left.

W&L led most of the first half
as Hampden-Sydney missed shots
and turned the ball over several
times. The Generals hit 8 points
in a row early in the half to take
a 11-4 lead. Ponti brought the
Tigers back, however, and the
W&L margin fell to a point with
9:38 remaining. Pat Dennis came
off the bench to get the Generals’
offense moving by scoring 8 points
in a little more than _ three
minutes. This did not stop the
Tigers as they tied it at 32-32
with 4:30 left in the half. Chris
Larson, John Podgajny and Flint

ace third

W&L with 6344, Davidson 53',
Clemson 1115, and College ol

W&L had six wrestlers reach
the finals but none of them were

able to take first. The Generals
did manage to take two third

place spots and one fourth place.
Reaching the finals for W&L were
Tom Morville at 118, Graham
Hudgins at 142, McFadden at 150,
Crytzer at 158, Bill Cole at 177
and heavyweight Dan _ Kniffen.

intermission.
Podgajny led both teams in

scoring in the first half with 12
points while Don Berlin led in
rebounds with 5. Both teams shot
poorly from the field at 45 per
cent. W&L did better in free
throws, however, hitiing 6-8 to
Ilampden-Sydney’s 8-14.

The start of the second half
saw a determined Hampden-Syd-
ney team come back to tie the
Generals at 41-41. Ponti and Tom-
my Jackson were hard to stop
underneath and the Tigers took
a 46-44 lead with 14 minutes left
to play.

The Generals’ hopes were weak-
ened with 12:39 left as their
tall center, Don Berlin, committed
his fourth foul. Jeff Baum and
Norm Kristoff, who made his first
appearance since injuring his
shoulder in early January, filled

under the boards.

Hampden-Sydney took a_ six-
point lead 58-53, after an easy
Marty McNerney layup with eight
minutes showing on the clock.
With that, Coach Canfield called
timeout and reorganized the team
with a few inspirational words.

And his strategy payed off as
the Generals came back with two
baskets by Flint and one by Kim
Sims to take a 59-58 lead. The
Tigers did not give up, however,
and the lead bounced back and
forth. Chris Larson hit a free
throw to tie the game at 63 all
with 3:33 remaining.

A lot happened in the last three
minutes but W&L led 70-69 with
33 seconds left. A Hampden-Syd-
ney player fouled Larson with
18 seconds remaining to send him
to the foul line. Larson converted
both attempts to give the Gen
erals a three-point lead and Hamp-
den-Sydney called timeout.

Things looked good for W&L
with only 12 seconds left on the

clock and a 72-69 lead. The Tigers
threw the ball in hoping to con
truct a three-point play. Only
half of their wish came true as
Ponti connected underneath for
a basket right at the buzzer but
was not fouled. The Generals won
72-71.

Three Generals, Podgajny, Lar
son and Flint, ended up scoring
double figures as W&L won its
eighth game in a row. Ponti led
both teams in scoring with 26
points. The Generals finished the
game shooting a poor 41 per cent
from the field. Hampden-Sydney
helped by missing 12 free throws
in 29 attempts.

changes reflect conciliatory mood between factions

are to be allocated to the candi-
dates and uncommitted groups in
proportion to the vote each re-
ceived (provided that is at least
15% of the vote).

What these changes seem to
indicate is more segmentation of
the vote, and, in a year when a
dozen are campaigning, it would
seem that everybody will get a
little piece of the cake. A ma-
jority will be hard to form on
the first ballot. Also, because the
candidates may hand pick their
delegates, those ‘smoke-filled’

rooms will be hard pre‘sed to

form a workable compromise.
But the rules changes represent
a lot more than procedure to the
Democratic Party—they are a
compromise between the McGov-
ern forces and the party’s regul-
ars. Each group has manhandled
one of the last two conventions;
the regulars in ’68 and the Mc-
Govern forces in ’72. In 1976,
neither faction can win the gen-
eral election in November with-
out the support of the other, so
it is about time for each to learn

The liberals were able to ‘bring
it home’ with smaller voting dis-
tricts or units, while the door
was reopened to the established

a large percentage of novice

Thompson, co-chairmen of the Stu-

that the National Lampoon show
last Friday night brought in $1150

expecting about $500.

Atwood also reported that the
SAB has purchased a new piano.
The piano cost the SAB $225, part
of which was paid by Student
Center director Mike Cappeto’s
funds.

Also Jay duRivage, chairman of
the Cold Check Committee, re-

$150 in the bank and is owed $190
in outstanding accounts,

DuRivage also questioned the
E.C. about the possibility of issu-
ing ID ecards which are color-cod-
ed by year. This would help Lex-
ington merchants in identifying
current W&L students, according
to duRivage.

McCullough told duRivage he
might talk to Colonel Harold

about the possibility of the idea.

Trustees veto coeducation,
defer decision o Pratt gift

Washington and Lee will re-
main all-male at the undergradu-
at level the Board of Trustees
has decided.

The vote to reaflirm W&L’s
traditional undergraduate admis-
sions policy came Saturday after
extensive consideration of a two-
volume report prepared by a
special trustee committee to
study the coeducation question.

That five-member committee
had been investigating arguments
for and against undergraduate co-
education for more than a year.
In the course of its study, the
sroup assembled detailed informa-
tion from a number of other
small, private, liberal-arts  col-
leges which have themselves ex-
amined the coeducaion question
in recent years. Most of those
colleges decided to become co-
educational, and accordingly the
trustees were able to analyze in
practical terms the consequences
of ecoedueation in each.

The board also sought out and
evaluated opinions from faculty
members, students, alumni and
parents

The trustees indicated that con-
siderations of size, curriculum,
and traditional character were
the primary factors which in-
fluenced their decision.

The board concluded from the
extensive data it had compiled
that coeducation would almost
necessarily require a substantial
inerease in the size of the student
body here. There has been gen-
eral agreement throughout the
university community, among ad-
vocates of coeducation as well as
opponents, that any significant in-
crease in the university’s size
should be avoided.

Coeducation might also affect
the university’s curriculum in un-
predictable ways, the data in-
dicated, with the result that
shifts might be expected in the
traditional “mix” between liberal-
arts and pre-professional aca-

demie patterns which W&L is

determined to preserve.

The board further said that by
its vote it reaffirmed the unique
historical character of the under-
graduate divisions—that its small-
ness, all-male character, and
calibre of its faculty and aca-
demies constitute a distinct asset.

In its resolution, the board
reliterated its endorsement of the
concept of “mutually agreeable
exchange programs and coopera-
tive arrangements” with neigh-
boring women’s colleges, such as
the Eight-College Exchange Pro-
gram in which W&L and other
p.ivate colleges in the region
have participated since 1970. ‘The
colleges in that program include
two which are coeducational.
Davidson and Randolph-Macon
(Ashland), and five others in addi-
tion to W&L which are not—
Hampden-Sydney, Hollins, Mary
Baldwin, Randolph-Macon Wo-

man’s, and Sweet Briar.

The full text of the resolution
adopted by the board is: “After
considering at length the report
of the Committee on Coeduca
tion, the Board of Trustees has
concluded that Washington and
Lee should remain all-male at
the undergraduate level, with the
exception of mutually agreeable
exchange programs and coopera-
tive arrangements with our neigi-
boring women’s colleges,”

in other business, a prominent

tive, S. L. Kopald, was elected to
the Board of Trustees.

Kopald, long an active sup-
porter of W&L and a former mem-
ber of the national W&L Alumni
Association board of direciors,
wil serve an initial six-year term
as a trustee of the university.

Also, the Board of Trustees
adopted the following resolution

(Continued on page 4)

Staff donations disclosed

Members of the W&L. staff
contributed almost $60,000 toward
the development program in u
special on-campus effort this fall
directed by Dr. Leon F. Sensa-
baugh, professor emeritus of lis
tory and a former dean of the
University.

The total contributed was $59,-
685, according to a report Pr.
Sensabaugh presented to the
board of trustees last weekend at
its mid-winter meeting here.

Dr. Sensabaugh said 336 indi-
viduals — approximately three-
quarters of the University’s per-
sonnel, from clerical and main-
tenance workers to members of
the faculty and administration —
contributed to the special effort.

Their donations are entirely
apart from contributions » hich
many of them make to the Alumni
Fund, Dr. Sensabaugh pointed
out.

The $59.685 pledged was rais-
ed between October and December
1975, and does not include any
capital gifts which a number of
employees made on their own
prior to the University-wide effort
last autumn. If those prior gilts
are included, a total of $240,235
has been contributed toward the

capital development program
since 1972—-when W&L began its
ambitious development program.
which has as its 1976 goal $36
million.

The Advisory Committee which
worked with Dr. Sensabaugh has
recommended to the trustees that
$25,000 of the money raised this
fall on campus be used to endow
a special University Scholarship.
and that the rest be used toward
construction of the planned new
undergraduate library.

 

How does one prepare for the Monthly Monday Marathon described
by a certain Doctor of History as the “faculty seance”? Two examples
of the ways to face the trauma are Dr. Lamont gritting his teeth
and Dr, Lowry carrying a very thick newspaper.

EC plans warning in two areas

By JOE FITZGERALD
The Executive Committee will
begin putting up signs this week

to discourage local youngsters
from playing in the Student

Center, and to warn students eat-
ing in the Commons that eating
without paying is an infraction
subject to consideration under the
Honor System.

The E.C. will also attempt to
work with the Lexington Police
in controlling problems in the
Center. and ask the IFC to take
some action to make clear to

freshman fraternity pledges that
they are required to eat at their
frat house on certain nights

The problems present in the
dining hall were brought up by
E.C. Seeretary Sandy Stradiman
also a member of the Food Com
mittee. Stradtman said there was
evidence that as many as 17 per-
sons had gone through the chow
line twice Sunday night, and that
some students were allowing other
persons to use their meal card
numbers to secure food.

The Visit: What price justice?

 

By GRAY COLEMAN

Scheduled to open on Saturday,
February 7 at 8 p.m. is the Uni-
versity Theatre’s production of
The Visit, a tragicomedy by Fried-
rich Durrenmatt

The author, a Swiss playwright,
wrote The Visit in 1956, and the
work will go down in theatrical
history as his major aceomplish-
ment. It was first staged in this

country in 1958. as a swan song

for the legendary Alfred Lunt
and Lynn Fontanne. and was a
major critical success.

The production is directed by
Robert W. Mish, a senior major
ing in drama and German. His
reason for choosing The Visit as
his senior directing thesis is to
combine drama with Germanic
culture, and also to portray a
story that will give the audience
a night of entertaining theatre

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

We elected these guys
to be drama critics?

The Executive Committee has put itself in the unenviable
position of having to judge the esthetic worth of a theatrical
production. It thus finds itself facing a that can be
interpreted as a motion of censure (censorship?) or support

By DAVID URANO

You may have noticed that after
the Christmas break, Rich John-
son, the manager of the record
store in the basement of the
Co-op, was replaced by Pat Hinely,
the former school photographer.

Johnson decided to further his
musical studies at a graduate
school in Boston. According to
his friend Hinely, he eventually
plans to compose, teach and re-
cord.

It was Hinely’s friendship with
Johnson which made Hinely the
new “manager of the record de-
partment of the University Supply
Store.”

Hinely, 24, entered W&L in
1969. In the true W&L spirit,
Hinely was initiated into the Pi
Kappa Phi fraternity, the same
frat to which Johnson belonged
before he graduated in 1968.

Johnson was the manager of
the Band Box, a Lexington record
store from 1970 to 1972. He was
fired in ’72 because his ideas
conflicted with those of the com-
pany’s

After he was canned, Johnson
became the record store manager.
During his freshman vear, Hinely
became extremely interested in
music and frequently visited the

record store. The music-loving
freshman and the record store

manager soon became friends.
Hinely graduated in 1973 with
a BA in journalism. After gradua-
tion, he free-lanced for a year
and then became a W&L photo-
grapher. When he was a senior,
he was the editor of the Caylx,
the “major accomplishment of my
W&L career,” he said. He added
that several of his pictures ap-
peared in that publication.
About a year ago, Hinley de-
cided to quit photography as a
living for a while, so he could
“set into it more,” he said. At
about the same time, Johnson de-
cided to leave Lexington. The
two talked about their plans,
Johnson asked Hinley if he wanted
to become the new record store
manager, and Hinely accepted. He
took over the first of this year.
Ilinely still takes pictures. As
a matter of fact, he spent the
Christmas break in his home state
of Florida taking pictures to add
to the portfolio he is assembling
to present to news publications,
advertising agencies and the like.

 

He said that pictures he took
while he was the school photo-
erapher and while he was free-
lancing will also be added to his
portfolio.

He still does some free-lance
photography for W&L. He will
be convering the lacrosse season

and will do “photo-reportage” of
the mock convention, something

he is looking forward to, he said.

Hinely has had two one-man
shows in the past two years. He
had one in the University Center
a couple of years ago, and one
in Roanoke at the Fine Arts
Center last spring. He has also
participated in five or six joint
shows. They’re usually the win-
place-show deals. “I’ve never got-
ten a first, sometimes I place and
sometimes I show,” he said.

Speaking of the future, Hinely
said it’s a blur. The only thing
he’s sure of is that his future
will include professional photo-
graphy, “but I don’t know when
or where.” He feels, however, his
next major photographic work
“lies away from Lexington,” he
said.

“Come back after Fancy Dress.”

Bob Keatley was in charge of
keeping track of Executive Com-
mittee money last year and he
kept using that line to stall the
co-chairmen of the Student Activi-
ties Board when they returned
week after week to ask the E.C.
for $500 to cover a deficit in the
SAB film committee. The E.C.
wanted to see how many dollars
the SAB made on their big week-
end before giving them any money
to cover their losses in other
areas.

If vengeance is indeed sweet,
it must be very satisfying for this
year's SAB to be able to tell
someone to “Come back after
Faney Dress.”

vention when the MC people come

Delegates

party on May 6, the Thursday
night before the quadrennial at-
temp! at second-guessing the
Democratic Party. Perhaps the
idea of the D-day party is to use
it for a last-ditch effort to fill
some of the less organized state
delegations.

Barring that approach or a
recruitment drive at the lacrosse

games, the gathering of warm
bodies to fill the jobs in the

delegations and the MC commit-
tees will continue to be a varied,
multi-pronged attack on the
apathy of the average W&L
gentleman.

First there will be a new piece
of seneral distribution literature
on the MC, something like a
“eampaign pamphlet” according
to Dave Braun, chairman of the
MC media committee, to supple-
ment the red, white, and blue
brochure put out earlier this year.
The MC is “gunning for around
Fancy Dress” on that, according
to Braun.

There will also be an insert in
this publication according to pres-
ent plans, and sometime in the
middle of March, the MC people
may set up tables in the dining
hall again, staffed by loyal MC
jankies who will pull unwary per-
sons out of the supper line and
put them to work on the delega-
tion from the American attache
offve in Peking. “After that,”
said Braun, “It’s going te be up
to the state chairmen” to fill their
d-legations.

Based on past conventions, they
will p‘ebably be able to finish
the job of recruitment before the
MC rolls around on May 7. AIl-

Increased dryer prices

prompt obvious query
Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

Lee Washington felt himself
fortunate today. Not only had he
been able to bum a quarter to

do a wash, and three dimes to
thoroughly drv one load of
clothes, but he had also found

an empty washer and dryer out
of the four of each available to
the more than 400 students whe
live in the dorms

Lee deposited his quarter in the
washing machine and then sat

down to catch up on some much
needed studying. When his spin-
dryless load was completed, he
removed his sopping wet clothes
from the washing machine and
placed them in the aged dryer.
He was frustrated by the know
ledge that he would have to spend
3 forty minute periods and three
dimes to dry one load of clothes,
but somehow he had managed to
eonsole himself of this fact of
life.

He placed his first dime in
the coin slot and much to his
dismay, noticed that the dime was
undersized for the slot. He check
ed that dime with another one
that he had in his pocket. Same

tions are closed and others are
close to it. The real problems
right now lie in whether the sev-
eral state will be able to raise
the money they need to carry
their allotted tasks.

The amount of money each
state is required to raise varies
depending on the size of the
state and the number of W&L
students from that state. Each
state is required to spend at least
$100 on its float for the parade
that will open the festivities on
May 7. In addition to that amount,
each delegation must gather from
25-100 worth of ads to go in
the Journal of the Mock Con-
vention.

Georgia is one state that is do-
ing well so far as its fund-raising
goes. According to Rodney Cook,
one of the state’s chairmen, the
money for the MC Journal is
raised, and the state is thinking
about spending $300 on its float.
But then, Georgia is represented

by 62 students at W&L.
Other states do not have 62
students here. Kansas has ap-

Reed Morgan, political chairman

Generals win three, lead league

By SAMMY THOMPSON

Washington and Lee’s basket
ball team added three more vic-
tories to its list last week and
increased its winning streak to
11 games.

The Generals edged Bridge
water, 72-68, Tuesday, and then
beat Virginia Wesleyan, 74-60,

Swimmers

dunk WésM

The W&L swimming team dis-
paved wny they are probably one
of the best small college teams in

the country with an impressive
performance here last Saturday
by defeating William and Mary

69-44. John Hudson remain; the
only swimmer to lead both Di
visions II and HII of the NCAA
in two events. He remains unde
feated in both the 500 and 1099
freestyle, and has easily qualified
for the nationals, which are to
be held later this year.

Tad Van Lee won both the 50
and 100 yard freestyle, and he
also has qualified for the nation-
als. Tad remains undefeated in
dual meet competion for the last
3 years. a tremendous example
of concistency in itself. He is
No. 1 in Division HI in the 50
vard freestyle, and he maintains
this status even though he has to
swim a number of relays each
meet.

Freshman Chip Hoke set a nev
school record in the 200 yard
backstroke, while another out
standing freshman, Keith Romich,
won the 209 freestyle. Senior cap
tain Rod Scott won the 500 vard

freestyle and the 200 yard indi-
viduil medley
Billy Cogar. who swept both

diving events, has also qualified
for the nationals and remains un-
defeated this year. The Generals,
who are now 6-1 on the year,
are finished with their home meets
for this season. They will compete
next at American University on
Friday night.

and Christopher Newport, 64-62,
over the weekend. The victories
give W&L a 13-3 record overall
and a league-leading 8-1 record
in the Virginia Conference Athle-
tic Association (VCAA).

Captain John Podgajny led the
scoring for W&L in the Bridge-
water game with 16 points and
forward Bob Flint had 12. Fresh
man Mike Wenke sealed the vic-
tory for the Generals, however,
when he hit six of six free-throws
in the final minutes of play.

Bridgewater had a 43-40 lead
at the half and pulled away to
a; much as a seven-point spread
m'dway through the second half.
Podgajny and Wenke brought
W&L back and the game ended
with the Generals ahead by four

Friday the Generals took on
Virginia Wesleyan for the second
time this season. W&L had beaten

them by 15 points Jan. 17. This
game was not won so easily how-
ever,

The “Blue Marlins” played well
enough to take a 37-33 lead at the
half. Coach Canfield said W&L
stood around against the Marlins’
zone defense in the first half.

Canfield said the defense held
in the second half long enough
fur W&L to reel off eight points
straight and enable a come-from-
behind victory. Freshmen Dave
Leunig and Artie Collins spurred
the Generals on. Jeff Baum came
up with some big rebounds and
W&L won 64-62. Podgajny led all
scorers with 20 points and Leunig
was second with 10.

Saturday W&L traveled to Chis-
topher Newport College in New-
port News. The Generals started
off slowly in a game that they

evertually won by 14 points. Can-

field said W&L eventually shot
68 per cent from the floor in the
first half. Canfield praised the
defense in general and the de
fense of Bob Flint in particular.
Canfield said the four corner stall-
defense had never been executed
better. W&L ended up winning
74-60 for their eleventh win in a
row,

The Cenerals faced Lynchburg
College, the only team to defeat
them in VCAA competition this
year, Tuesday night. W&L will

EC postpones play decision

(Continued from page 1)
saying that any unwelcome guests
anywhere in the Center besides
the Cockpit were subject to arrest.
The job of keeping watch for
these persons, detaining them if
possible, and summoning the
police, will be handled by a group
tentatively called the Police-Stu-
dent Liaison Committee. The com-
mittee was proposed by Freshman
representative Billy Webster.

Also, the E.C. decided to wait
until next week before making
any decision on a recent re-
quest from Brian Garr for $50 to
buy scripts and props for a play
he is directing, The Boys in the
Band. The play is an extra pro-
duction not covered by the Uni-
versity Theatre budget.

Leland McCullough suggested

that the decision be put off until

the E.C. could find out the
opinions of the student body on
the production. McCullough asked
Garr whether the play would con-
tain anything that might offend
townspeople attending the pro-
duction. “I would like to make
sure they don’t think we're a
bunch of derelicts up here,” Me-
Cullough said.

Pugh said he would like to see
a return to “traditional plays,’
mentioning that he would like to
see Arsenic and Old Lace. Bob
Couch, a member of the Minority
Affairs Co-ordinating Committee,
mentioned that the E.C. might be
infringing on the rights of homo-
sexuals in its questioning of the
play. “Pugh, you’re walking on
thin ice,” he warned.

Arkansas senator to deliver
unity address at convention

By The News Staff

Arkansas Senator Dale Bumpers
will speak to the Mock Conven-
tion on Saturday, May 8, to
deliver the Democratic Party
Unity Speech. Bumpers’ address
will begin before the nominating
process,

Bumpers’ appearance was an-
nounced Friday by WLUR-FM
and confirmed Monday by the MC
Media committee.

The purpose of the address, ac-
cording to MC political chairman
Reed Morgan, is to define the
qualities expected of the Demo-

crats’ Presidential nominee and
to emphasize W&L’s responsibility
to uphold its convention’s record.

Bumpers was selected by the
convention to give some regional
diversity to the slate of speakers
scheduled to appear during the
two-day convention. Bumpers
joins keynote speaker William
Proxmire, a senator from the Mid-
west, and platform speaker Don
Riegle, a representative, also from
the Midwest.

Bumpers was selected to repre-
sent the Southern wing of the
party at the Mock Convention be-

EC splits on vote
to fund “The Boys’

By BOB CHIAVIELLO

The Executive Committee voted
7-4 Monday night to appropriate
$50 for director Brian Garr’s pro-
duction of The Boys in the Band
in March. The vote followed much
heated discussion.

The EC had made an informal
poll of the student body to see
how it would react to a play with
homosexual overtones. A major
objection to the play was the
possibly offensive nature of the
script. Bill Garrison said, “I can’t
sanction the activity because it
won't be a family type entertain-
ment for the townspeople.”

When a student remarked if
the EC appropriated $50 a week
to such activities it would cost
the student body $1500, Leland
McCullough said, “I don’t know
nothin "bout math,” but quickly
added that it wasn’t the money
but the moral issue involved.

Radar Davis cited that in ‘The
Devil in Miss Jones” there were
homosexual acts and no one
minded,

At the end of the discussion
Brian Garr thanked the EC for
a job well done in polling the
University community about the
play

The curriculum committee re
ported that it is on schedule with
its course survey. They have a
“computer expert” working on
the project trying to iron out a
few of the remaining problems.

Rick Wolf reported that all the
speakers have been signed for the
Mock Convention, but that nothing

is real rosy. They have met with
Coach Miller and all is well:
Doremus Gym will be available
for the convention!

Jay McCann, the editor of
Ariel, reported that a nice big
winter issue is at the printer now.
There will be 300 copies of the

cause of his reputation as a “suc-
cessful Southern Governor and
popular Democrat,” according to
the Media committee.

Bumpers, the junior senator
from Arkansas, received national
prominence in 1974 by unseating
incumbent J. William Fulbright

in the Senate primary, taking
65° of the vote.

Bumpers was governor of
Arkansas from 1970-74, leaving

the post partly because of the low
pay. Arkansas pays its executive
$10,000 a year, the lowest gub-
ernatorial remuneration in the
nation.

Part of Bumpers’ campaign for
governor in 1970 ineluded his
declaration that segregation is
“immoral.” As governor of Ark-
ansas, he served as chairman of
the National Democratic Gover-
nors’ Caucus.

The 50-year old senator cur-
rently serves on the Aeronautical
and Space Sciences Committee,
and on two subcommittees of the
Interior and Insular Affairs Com-
mittee. The subcommittees are
the Energy Research and Water
Resources, and the Environmental
and Land Resources.

Tax assistance offered

By BURTON BARTLETT

A pilot program of free federal
income tax help is being offered
by a group of W&L accounting
students for Lexington and Rock-
bridge residents under the Volun
teer Income Tax Assistance
(VITA) program

The group is being taught basic
income tax law by Dr. Edward
Schwan of the accounting depart
ment. Dr. Schwan is also serving
as the faculty advisor for the
group. Senior accounting major
Itunter Charbonnet is the chair-
man; Bob Jungman, a junior ac
counting major, is director of per
sonnel and scheduling; sopho
more Burton Bartlett is taking
cure of publicity

The free help offered by the
roup is directed toward senior
citizens, persons in lower income

Caucus victories benefit Carter

By DORMAN WALKER

Jimmy Carter may be Washing-
ton and Lee’s Democratic nomi-
nee if the Mock Convention tradi-
tion of grass-roots accuracy is in
evidence this Spring. With caucus
victories in lowa and Maine, and
near-victories in Oklahoma and
Mississippi, Carter will roll into
the Convention with a lot of
delegates and a lot of support.

His caucus victories result in
part from his well-organized cam-
paign staff, and this same staff
is expected to help Carter win
in New Hampshire.

The New Hampshire primary
will be a three-way battle be-
tween Carter, Udall, and Birch
Bayh, according to Chris Brown,

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Thursday, February 12, 1976

Potpourri

The Executive Committee voted to fund the upcoming
production of the play, “The Boys in the Band.” Members of
that august body did go out among their fellow classmates and
did poll them on the issue—although the responses were fairly
divided, it appears that slightly more students supported the
use of student body funds for the presentation than were
opposed to the idea.

In the end, the individual members of the E.C. voted not
on the basis of their personal prejudices. They voted the way
they felt their constituents would want them to—which is
how they are supposed to vote.

Ss es eS

In the drama debate, it was mentioned a number of times
that the play should not be sanctioned by the E.C. (or even
be produced, for that matter) because it might prove offensive
to members of the Lexington community-at-large. We do not
agree with that objection, and we do not feel that our dramatic
productions should cater to the preferences of the com-
munity—there are other means to develop beneficial relations
between “town” and “gown” than to hamstring ourselves
artistically.

A further item on Monday night's agenda illustrated this
that the Mock
Convention Secretariat has been in contact with members of
the senior class at Lexington High School, and has thus far
received encouraging replies concerning involvement of high

point well, we thought. It was disclosed

school students in the upcoming mock Democratic Conven-
tion. Townspeople enjoy observing the quadrennial parade
and other festivities, but the inclusion of Lexington students
in the actual operations of the convention is an idea worthy
of full consideration and support (and would aid in com-
munity relations, no doubt).

\ preliminary survey has been taken among the members
of the junior and senior classes regarding the re-establish-
ment of a mandatory Freshman English Composition course.
Of the ninety or so students polled, roughly 75% were in
favor of reinstating such a requirement. After all the brouhaha
in the Sixties before specific course requirements were abolish-
ed, we find it curious to note the trend exhibited in recent
polls on the subject, both here and at other colleges. It seems
that a student who is graduated under the “liberalized” system
frequently finds that he cannot compose a coherent, gram-
matically accurate sentence, find the hypotenuse of a right
triangle, or even name the beligerents in the Thirty Years’
War. Perhaps basic requirments, at least in English, would
put us back on the road leading toward liberal education, in
the true sense of the phrase.

The student whose auto was damaged several weeks ago
by a band of disorderly students discovered last Wednesday
that the roof of his car had been slashed. We did not condone
the original damage, although we may have implied it in-
advertently. We find this newest episode deplorable, and are
disgusted by the fact that there is a student on this campus
who would even consider such action, It is indeed a depraved
person that would continue to harass the owner of the car,
and it is our hope that, if and when it catches the criminal(s)
involved in this latest incident, Student Control will not be
lenient in its determination of the proper punishment.

* * * * *

Speakng of students and criminal acts, we understand that
in recent weeks there have been a number of individuals who
have either been going through the meal line in Evans Dining
Hall twice or have been lending their meal cards to un-
authorized individuals. Students are reminded that either of
these practices is considered an Honor Violation,

We would also like to remind all freshmen who belong to
fraternities that they are required to eat at their respective
houses on the indicated nights. The practice of eating at a
fraternity house and then again at dining hall is questionable,
and offenders will be dealt with severely when apprehended

‘The Visit’: the good, the bad,
and the possibly confusing

By W. S. BAKER

At a school where only four or
five plays are presented each year
one must criticize carefully. After
all, they might stop putting them
on altogether. And yet in the case
of “The Visit” I can’t help but
think this might be best.

Friedrich Durrenmatt’s  tragi-
comic vision of the victory of
greed in a world without God is
currently being produced by the
University Theatre, under the di-
rection of Robert Mish. There will
be one last performance, tonight
at 8:00 p.m., and all who have yet
to see the show are highly recom-
mended to do so. Despite minor
technical problems and some con-
fusing thematic inconsistencies,
the morality tale is still worth
the two hours the play lasts.

The play centers on the town
of Guellen, its citizens, and a
group of visitors, the most promi-
nent of which is Mme. Clare
Zachanassian (played by Jennifer
Taylor.) The town is being strangl-
ed by poverty, a financial desti-
tution that mysteriously beset the
once-prosperous community some
years before. Later in the play we
learn more of Guellen’s history;
specifically of the trial of a 17
year old girl, the court’s decision
of guilt, her pregnancy and her
ignoble depature from town. This
girl (Clare) then became a whore,
met and married an oil ty-

The 1972 Mock Convention was
big. The Ring-tum Phi of that day
and year frequently mentioned
this fact. As evidence of the MC's
size, the newspaper often noted
that the budget for the affair was
a massive $12,000. The funds for
this year’s extravaganza approach
$32,000, as noted in the title of
this column. The total student
body budget for this school year
is about $56,000.

The student body funds are con-
trolled by the Executive Commit-
tee, which meets once a week to
review how the various commit-
tees are spending the money
given them in September. In its
Monday night meetings, the E.C.
will also give out more student
body money on occasion, to fund
such projects as jazz trumpeteers,
ethnic poets, and an issue or two
of an alternative rag.

The MC funds are controlled by
a steering committee, which meets
once a week to review the various
projects essential to the success
of the MC. In its Sunday night
meetings the steering committee
looks at the progress of the sev-
eral committees and delegations
that will converge on Doremus
Gym in three months to decide in
two days what the Democratic
Party will decide in a week.

The meetings of the E.C. are
open to the press with one stipula-
tion: the committee regularly goes
into executive session to discuss
appointments to student body sub-
committees, even though the stu-
dent body constitution states that
the E.C. may close its meetings
only to discuss “matters of honor.”

The meetings of the steering
committee of the MC are open
to the press with one stipulation
they are “open, but off the ree-
ord,” according to political chair:
man Reed Morgan. The student
body constitution makes no com-

The SCC and student

By PAUL MORELLA
and STEPHEN YEVICH

Originally created by the Uni-
versity faculty, the Student Con-
trol Committee (SCC) was de-
signed to investigate, act upon
and exercise the faculty's inherent
power to control student conduct.

With all the rumors that have
been circulating in recent weeks
about the SCC, and the notice
which appeared on __ bulletin
boards concerning SCC action on
a marijuana case, the Ring-tum
Phi thought it would be appropri-
ate to present some basic in-

ment on when these meetings may
be closed.

Tradition would seem to indi-
cate that this body, commanding
a third of the student body
budget, should hold its meetings
in private. After all, when the
Democrats meet in New York this
summer, chances are the hysteria
on the floor will be little more
than a warm-up for the headline
performance in the notorious
smoke-filled back room.

The MC office is not exactly a
moke-filled room, but it will have
to serve the purpose this time,
even if it does look like the room
where the next president of the
Jaycees would be picked, not
the President of the United States.
The walls are lined with several
American flags, one Bicentennial
flag, and several posters which
might be considered tasteful de-
pending on one’s views of the
Democratic field of prospective
nominees.

In one corner of the room is
a large metal box which holds
the switching circuitry for the
four telephones in the room.
There are also several desks and
filing eabinets and the other ac-
couterments of modern bureau-
cracy. In the center of the room
is a long conference table where

appear uncomfortable and out of
place amidst the filth and enough
style to emphasize that one with
her money doesn’t need to “fit in”
anywhere. Ms. Taylor charact-
erizes Clare with a quiet determi-
nation; unfortunately this is at
the expense of removing all ve-
hemence, power, and animism
from the character. Although I
agree that Clare is somewhat in-
human, a figure of evil, a patch-
work of artificial limbs, I see a
certain “justice” in her vengeance,
Although perverse to the ex-
treme, her “justice” is one of the
central paradoxes of the play:

formation on the committee and
its functions.

“The SCC works through and
with the Executive Committee to
determine those cases that in-
volve Honor Code violations and
those that require other forms of
disciplinary action,” according to
Gary Seldomridge, chairman of
the committee.

Seldomridge continued by say-
ing that the committee acts and
investigates all complaints of stu-
dent misconduct which are not
under the jurisdiction of the EC,
“Most of the time it is pretty

In the coming weeks, God,

uled to get off its lackadaisical
track, and begin running pro-
files of the several committees
represented around that long gray
table every Sunday, and try to
give our readers some idea of

ents, and sirs the alumni, is being

clear-cut which actions are under
our command and which actions
are under control by the EC,”
he said.

The SCC at W&L is unique in
the sense that it is run by the
students for the students, and the
only way the system can success-
fully function is if student honor
is maintained. “The committee
works well because of the trust
the students put in us as well as
in their fellow students,” said
Seldomridge.

SCC jurisdiction extends to all
student conduct in Lexington and
Rockbridge County, at surround-
ing colleges, and at any Univer-
sity-related activity, wherever
held. This would cover athletic
events at other colleges, and
definitely includes University
housing, according to Lewis John,
Dean of Students. “The commit-
tee’s jurisdiction covers the
Woods Creek apartments, just as
it covers the dormitories,” said
John. “Both types of housing are
University-owned and controlled,
and both fall under the same
regulations and supervision.”

When the committee receives
a complaint of student miscon-
duct, the normal procedure is to
notify the student of the charges
and instruct him to appear be-
fore the committee. The complaint
is considered, investigated, and
acted upon by the committee. A
two-thirds vote of those commit-
tee members present is required
for a finding of student mis-
conduct; thereupon a penalty is
decided by a simple majority
vote.

If the SCC determines that a
student should be penalized, the

secret delight in going to the
“Grill,” late at night, to view
the often bizzare, motley-clad
locals, who found its Mordor-like
inner recesses a congenial place
to alight for the evening.

The establishment now occupy-

ing the late “Corner Grill” is
called, as I've indicated, the
“Good Trencherman Deli” (it

would have been a good joke to
retain the former name). The
interior has been completely
renovated, and painted a sani-
tary white. The decor remains a
bit stark, especially when com-
pied to the turn-of-the-century
motif of the “Palm Parlor’ down
the street; no doubt plans exist
to enliven the walls a bit. The
mot delightful surprise was the
hackground music; one does not
even expect background music in
Lexington, and this was not of
the objectionable 101-Strings-den-
tist-office variety, but rather mel-
low Gershwinesque jazz piano.

While recently visiting for
lunch, I had my favorite deli
sandwich, Pastrami, and a mug
of coffee, The pastrami was pass
able, though it could have been
leaner. My coffee mug was kept
full by the waitress, a fine restau
rant practice, and the service was
efficient by local standards, even
though the luncheon crowd was
large

The menu includes sandwiches,
salads and cheeses. A nice touch
to the beverage list is cider, and
application has been made for a
liquor license

In sum, the “Treneherman”
has the potential to offer a good
lunch or dinner in comfortable
surroundings, and | suspect the
proprietors are truly concerned
with doing things right. You
should go in expecting to pay over
two dollars. The hours are 11 am
to 7pm. and cold-cuts are avail
able by the pound at the counter

Generals snap long winning
streak, succumbing to ODU

By SAMMY THOMPSON

Washington and Lee’s basket-
ball team won its 13th game in a
row last week before losing to
Old Dominion University in Nor-
folk Saturday.

Thursday the Generals beat
Emory and Henry College by the
lopsided score, 98-53.

Six players ended up in double
figures for the Generals and the
team as a whole outshot their
opponents from the floor, 48 per
cent to 28 per cent.

W&L did not waste any time
getting started as they grabbed a
6-0 lead two minutes and 15 sec-
onds into the first half. Mike Clark
and Jerry Stewart kept Emory and
Henry close in the first half, how-
ever, and the Generals led by 10
points at intermission.

But at the start of the second

half, it was all W&L. The Gen-
erals scored nine straight points
before an E&H player connected
with a free throw to make the
score 40-22 in favor of W&L.
Head coach Verne Canfield de-
cided to ease up on his op-
ponents most of the second half
by substituting freely. To his sur-
prise, however, the W&L lead
only increased.

Don Berlin led all scorers with
16 points followed by Pat Dennis
(14), John Podgajny (13), Bob
Flint (12), Chris Larson (11) and
Norm Kristoff (11).

The Generals, led by Flint with
10, outrebounded E&H, 63-45.

Saturday W&L traveled to Nor-
folk looking for their 16th win of
the year against defending Di-
vision II national champion Old
Dominion University.

Old Dominion had a tough time
in the first half as they shot a
miserable 17.1 per cent from the
floor. W&L Captain John Podgajny
was the leading scorer at the half
and the Generals led, 30-24.

In the second half Old Do-
minion came alive, however. Joey
Caruthers hit five of his first
second half shots to tie the game
at 32 all. At the 12:37 mark he
made a layup that gave ODU the
lead for good.

Podgajny had 17 points for the
Generals and Flint had 14. Four
players finished in double figures
for ODU. Caruthers led all scor-
ers with 22. The final score was
ODU 78, W&L 66.

The Generals now have a 15-4
record and a chance to clinch the
Virginia College Athletic Associa-
tion (VCAA) championship, A win
over Christopher Newport Tues-
day and Eastern Mennonite Thurs-
day would give them the title.
Both games are being played in
Doremus Gym at 8 p.m.

Crytzer retains state crown
Generals place third in tourney

By KENNETH MASTRILLI

Team captain Jimmy Crytzer
successfully defended his state
championship crown at 158 pounds
as W&L placed four wrestlers in
the finals of the VCAA state
tournament. Although they
wrestled admirably the Generals
only managed to finish a close
third in the overall standings.

Of the seven teams entered
WA&L totaled 67% points behind
team champion George Mason's
86 and runner-up Madison's 68%.
Other teams behind the Generals
were Virginia State 49%, host
Eastern Mennonite 19'2, Hamp-
den-Sydney 16 3/4 and Lynchburg
11%.

Lee Keck at 134, Graham
Hudgins at 142, and Kevin Me-
Fadden at 150 all wrestled well
before losing in the finals of their
particular matches. Rick Heldrich

Only 21 more days, folks, till you-know-what season

Lacrosse season is almost here.

Head coach Jack Emmer said
the final team cut should come
this weekend and would leave him
with about 33 players.

The season opens March 5 at
North Carolina State and March
6 at Duke University. The first

are the only two seniors from last
year’s team that were lost to
graduation.

The General’s offense will be
led once again by Donnie Carroll
and Rob Morgan. Last year Car-
roll led the team in total points
with 40 goals and 45 assists for

Charlie Brown, who had 146 saves
in the goal.

The midfield will be better this
year but still will be W&L’s least
experienced position.

Last year’s leading faceoff men,
Rick Kulp and Brent Miller, are
not out for the team this year.

 

at 167, Bob Rogers at 177, Steve
Schweizerhof at 190 and heavy-
weight Dan Kniffen all won their
consolation finals matches for
third place.

Just threedays before’ the
VCAA meet, W&L scored one of
its biggest and most unexpected
victories of the current season
with a convincing 28-12 victory
over Madison College, the defend-
ing VCAA champions. After los-
ing the first two matches, W&L
was trailing at one point in the
match by a score of 7-0, but then
came on to win six of the last
8 matches.

American downs
WEL swimmers
despite relay team

The swimming team won just
four of 13 events but could still
defeat host American University
by winning the last event, the 400-
yard freestyle relay, last Satur-
day in Washington, D.C.

The Generals’ four-man team
then posted its best time of the
year (3:18.87) and easily qualified
for the NCAA national champion-
ship meet. But W&L lost both the
race and the meet as American’s
team swam a 3:17.4.

En route to the dramatic finish,
W&L had outstanding perform-
ances from John Hudson, who won
both the 200-yard and 500-yard
freestyle events, and Billy Cogar,
who swept both diving events.
Both have qualified for the na-
tional meet, along with the 400-
yard relay team of Keith Romich,
Hudson, Tad Van Leer and Gary
Seldomridge.

Hudson remains undefeated in
his freestyle specialties and now
leads the nation in Division II in
three events—the 200, 500 and
1000 freestyle.

The Generals, now 6-2 in dual
meets, take to the road this week-
end to meet Old Dominion Friday
and always strong University of
Richmond Monday.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

J-prof warns of TV abuses

The enormously useful potential
of international television broad-
casting by satellite is in danger of
being entirely lost to narrow
political interests and power
structures, according to a retired
W&L journalism professor—and
a major share of the blame, he
says, should be placed with the
world’s intellectual community
for its indifference in the face of
the problem.

The observations are made by
O. W. Riegel, who taught journ-
alism here for 43 years until re-
tiring in 1973, in a new anthology
of articles presented to the ninth
General Assembly of the Inter-
national Association for Mass
Communication Research.

In the essay, Riegel expresses
alarm at the apparently unchal-
lenged trend among the world’s
governments—especially those of
“the so-called ‘underdeveloped’
nations’—to view international
television communication as a
tool of political self-interest.

Riegel notes his keen disap-
pointment in the United Nations,
particularly with UNESCO, “a
body presumably dedicated to the
expansion of the knowledge and
experience of all the people of
the world.”

He points to a single UNESCO-
sponsored resolution, adopted by
the United Nations General As-
sembly in 1972, which “proclaims
at one and the same time (a) the
sanctity of world freedom of in-
formation, and (b) the right of
governments to interfere unilat-
erally with communications at any

time for what they claim to be
‘self-defense’.”

The future of direct satellite
broadcasting, he declares, is in
jeopardy of being lost to “power
politics, suspicion, fear and the
arguments of the lawyers.”

Particularly disturbing, Riegel
observes, is the failure of the
world’s scholars to develop ways
to influence these policies by
means of objective research into
ways new technology can be used
“to increase the flow of informa-
tion” by satellite broadcasting
and parallel ways to identify and
alert “the ordinary people of the
world’—as distinguished from
governments—about the nature
of policies which “tend to re-
strict such a flow.”

In new nations in particular, he
says, governments “apparently
propose to seal off a possible new

window to the world before it is
even opened . .. New communica-
tions facilities have been man-
-yleajs pue posi, ‘jueq ‘pease
jacketed in the interests of op-
pressive nationalistic oligarchies
whose paramount concern is not
the enlightenment of their peoples
but their own self-preservation.”

Riegel concludes that if there
exists a consensus among the
world’s scholars based on both
research and “conscience,” it must
be used to “press its judgments
and recommendations upon na-
tional leaders and the world pub-
lic.”

The alternative, he predicts, is
that the international intellectual
community can ‘wait for the ac-
complished fact, and then in the
tradition of ‘scholarship’ produce
inventories, analyses, schematics
—or, perhaps, an epitaph.”

(Continued from page 2)
play through his physical appear-
ance as well as his speech. His
accurate portrayal of Schill led
me to a _ perception of Clare
and his fate and a judgment of
Guellen’s townfolk.

The supporting roles in “The
characters who represent the
Visit” are crucial; they are the
town’s self image. As the School
teacher, Dan Scott lends the play
enough of a humanist plea to
seize our sympathy in Schill’s
favor. The God-forsaken nature of
Guellen was aptly presented by
Lecky Stone as the Priest. Though
we expect moral strength, the
Priest is a man unable to resist
the temptation Clare places in
front of him.

Less pleasing were the roles of
the Burgomaster and the Police-
man played by Warren Mowry
and John Hollinger respectively.
Each of these roles demands a

student may appeal the case to
the Student Affairs Committee
within 48 hours. The SAC, a stu-
dent-faculty committee under the
aegis of the University Council
which aets as a review board, may
alter the findings or penalty of
the committee in any manner
whatsoever.

One of the difficulties that the
SCC presents, according to Sel-
domridge, is that it is difficult
to discipline a fellow student. But
problems that were expected in
this area have not developed, as
Dean John explains. “Originally,
every SCC decision had to go to
the SAC, and the SAC had to
review and act upon each and
every disciplinary matter,” said
John. “When the procedure was
revised, and every SCC decision
was not subjected to review,
there were fears that the SCC
would not be hard enough on stu-
dents, since Student Control is a
student-only committee.” It has
frequently worked out the other
way, with SCC handing down stiff
penalties, which the SAC oe-
casionally feels obligated to re-
duce.

“In most cases which are ap-
pealed, the SAC has either up-
held or lightened the penalties,’
continued John. ‘These fears
were unfounded, as te SCC has
dealt fairly, yet wit sufficient
firmness, in matters o° discipline.”

The basic penalties which can
be imposed upon individuals
found guilty of misconduct in-
clude:

1) Monetary fines in amounts

up to $5.

2) Social Probation.

3) Dormitory Probation,

4) Specific tasks related to the
nature of the misconduct.

5) Reprimand.

The SCC can also, in extraordi-
nary cases, recommend to the
SAC that a student be suspended
or expelled from the University,
but the SCC itself does not have
the power to take such drastic
action. Recommendations of this
magnitude appear to be rare.

Dean John believes that one of
the main strengths in the system
is that it is totally student-run
at the SCC level, and Seldomridge
agrees. “The system is unique at
W&L in that all business is con-
ducted by the students,” said
Seldomridge, “and this creates a
‘genuine’ student government.”

One area that still needs resolu-
tion is the delineation between
matters that should be handled by
the IFC and those that should be
dealt with by the SCC.

John feels that overall the sys-
tem has worked quite well, par-
ticularly since composition of the
SCC was altered to include elect-
ed class officers; he noted that the
SCC has acted responsibly in
nearly all matters.

“We try to emphasize the im-
portance of the individual in a
trustworthy nature,” said Seldom-
ridge. “We are not a police force
but rather a committee designed
to help the students and help to
incorporate the _ institutional
philosophy.”

tight discipline befitting their
positions as “enforcers of justice.”
Though the roles seem to have
great comic potential they were
played halfway between the comic
and the tragic, rather farcical. It’s
as if the actors tried to keep them-
selves in both of these dramatic
worlds and ended up falling
through the abyss which lies be-
tween.

Such a confusion permeated
the whole play. At the heart of
this production of “The Visit’ lies
a failure to define the play. Is it
tragic? Or is it comic? Are we to
be aghast at Aaton’s fate? Does
Clare align her version of justice
with his cruel fate? Does she spin
the web of Anton’s fate and then
cut the thread?

Or is Clare a human extension
of the moral infirmity of all men?
Is Clare human?

At times the action of the play
unravels so furiously that one
can't help but feel the actors will
collapse in a loud and dusty heap
in the middle of the stage. This
is when it is at its best. At other
times the play slows down to the
pace of a meander. The only
effect of this changing rhythm was

jor Carter issue, however. Carter
defines the most crucial issue as
unemployment. In addition he
promises federal administration
of welfare, reduced defense spend-
ing, an honest government, a
solution to the energy crisis, tax
reform, and better health care.

The issues are proving at-
tractive not only to New Hamp-
shire voters, but also to the
people in other primary states.
For Carter, the key primaries, be-
sides New Hampshire, are New
York, Pennsylvania, and Illinois.
Carter is reducing his Massachu-
set's effort so that he can spend
more time and money against
Wallace in the Florida primary.

Carter’s success in these states
will no doubt be important when
the real Democratic Presidential
Convention opens later this year.
But chanees are that by the time
that body meets, Carter will al-
ready have received the nod from
W&L’s own Democratic conven-
tion.

Fancy Dress Weekend arrives;
University braces for hangover

By Robert Lutz,

News Editor

“A Salute to Hollywood,” the
1976 Fancy Dress Ball, climaxes
Washington and Lee’s 69th near-
annual monster party weekend
tomorrow night during what S.A.-
B. co-chairperson Terry Atwood
indicates will be two or three of
the best days this University has
ever seen.

The action gets under way to-
nite from 9 to 1 in the simply yet
elegantly decorated Zollman’s
Pavillion, where those inclined to
get a jump on the weekend may

sway to the soulful sounds of the
Marvelettes. Liquor, mixers, ice,
cups and such are solely the re-
sponsibility of the individual par-
tygoer and will not be available
otherwise. Students are reminded
that admission to this event is in-
cluded in the $10 advance ticket
price.

The real excitement, however,
begins Friday evening at 8:30
when the stately doors of Fairfax
Lounge (the only official entrance
and exit), graced by a flashing
Hollywood-type theater marquee,
open wide to admit the first lucky

couple as they sweep into the foy-
er. Hopefully, the first and all gen-
tlemen attending will display the
proper attire of black tie (tuxe-
do or dinner jacket, for the hope-
lessly naive) ,if not, the burly and
altogether unpleasant doorman
may be tempted to violence.

socialities will believe themselves

“the glamorous world of Tinsel-
town” as they explore the cleverly
renovated Early-Fielding Student
Center. After pausing to consider

Co-ed business program planned

By BOB CHIAVIELLO

The Summer Institute for Ca-
reers in Business will open its
doors for the first time here at
Washington and Lee to assist to-
day’s college student in making
the transition from the classroom
to the business world.

The intensive 27-day program is
aimed at college juniors and gra-
duating seniors who plan on mak-
ing a career in business. The In-
stitute is coeducational and open
to men and women who have not
had any previous business train
ing.

The Summer Institute’s curricu-
lum is designed to utilize and fo-
cus the skills already developed
through a training in the liberal
arts, sciences, or engineering, and
integrating them into the busi-
ness world.

The curriculum is modeled af-
ter the W&L program in business
administration. The course will be
conducted through formal teach-
ing sessions, seminars, and work-
shops, where the student will
learn about the American business
system and the vocabulary and
fundamentals of business admini-
stration.

In addition to the formal in-
struction and the practical ap-
plication of business principles,
students will have the opportunity

     
    

to meet informally with practicing
business executives.

There will be no formal exami-
nations, but the student will be
able to make self-evaluations
through informal meetings with
the faculty.

At the end of the program a
certificate will be presented by
W&L signifying the successful
completion of the Summer
stitute. No college credit wil
given.

The total cost of
will be $875 which wi
instructional fees,
board, refreshments,

The Fall and Rise of Fancy Dress

By FRITZ GOLDBERG

Open windows in the middle of
February were not enough. Evans
Dining Hall still flowed with sweat
and beer during last year’s Fancy
Dress Ball. The cafeteria was so
packed with human bodies that a
person on the wrong end of the
room had to go out the door and
around the block to find a bath-
room.

An indication of the size was
the fact that at least ten marshalls
had to be hired to try and enforce

the alcohol rules laid down by
our friends and yours, Virginia

Alcoholic Beverage Control Board.
An indication of the marshalls’
success was the fact that by the
end ef the evening most of them
were more inebriated, that is,
sloshed to the bitter max, than
the people they were supposed to
be controlling.

Whether Fancy Dress ‘76 will
be a repeat of last year’s suecess
still remains to be seen. If the
Ball does not live up to the 1975
standards, the SAB can always
claim suecess by pointing further
into the past than last year, and
comparing its efforts to the works
of its predecessor, the Dance
3oard. in the early years of this
same decade.

As late as 1968, the Fancy Dress
brouhaha was still alive and well.

and W&L was still, if one can
judge from the outward signs, a

bastion of traditional gentlemanli-
ness: the kind of gentlemanliness
that led the editor on the Friday
Ring-tum Phi (we were semi-
weekly back then) to rise his
editorial voice in protest of allow-
ing students to attend fraternity
parties without dates.

Those were the days, we sup-
pose. But the traditional air was
already starting to become be-
fouled by the onslaught of the

Spirit of ‘68, a movement that
ran from psychedelia to peace
marches to bitter cynicism, and

left behind it an American col-
lege scene that would never be
the same, except in Lexington.
But we are here to talk of
dance ;, not disillusionment, so let
us go back to January 10, 1969,
when the Ring-tum Phi announced

the plans for the forthcoming
Fane. Dress. At that time the
forma! ball was held on Friday
nigit. the same as the present

tradition, but the informal danee
came on the Saturday after the
ball, not the Thursday before. Per-
haps the ones who came before
us weve more in favor of getting
things over with (hence the cele
bration after the fact) whereas
we are more attuned to prepar-

Carter

By PHILIP HATCHETT

If vou listen to the eleven
candidates now centered in New
England, one is quickly taken at
the number of ways each dis
claims his alliance with political

power, tenures in Washington, or
past political accomplishments.
They seem to say through no

political knowledge can glory be
restored to Americans. As David
Broder said in Lee Chapel this
past fall. “This is the year of the
non-candidate.”

The map who has engineered
this approach most successfully ts
the Southern peanut § grower,
Jimmy Carter

The Carter campaign is selling
America on a man who has never
lived or worked in the Nation's
capital, and therefore (according
to aides) has not been corrupted
by the power struggles of the
bureaucracy nor owes or earns
political favors. Carter is a man
who claims to be honest, open and
compassionate on page two of his
brochure, and says on page three
‘Being President of the United
States is not the most important
thing in the world to me

The man from Plains, Georgia

ton to post-Watergate, President

ing for things.

Fancy Dress ’69 had one theme
for Friday night and another for
Saturday night. Friday’s formal
was an “Inauguration Ball.” Rich-
ard Nixon was being sworn in
around that time but Fancy Dress
was not that relevant. The ball
saluted President Huntley, who
was new to his job at the time.
The “relevance” came on Satur-
day when the theme was ‘“Love-
in 69.” A Ring-tum Phi headline

spoke of a “light show” and
“psychedelic music.” And if we

can believe the Ring-tum Phi edi-
torial that followed the events,
the love-in came off with all the
peace, love, flowers, sunshine and
disorganization that would become

a

an official mainstay of the Wood-
stock nation seven months later.

The concert on Saturday start-
ed at 8:20. The doors were opened
at 8. The concert was announced
as starting at 8. Many couples left
after the first band. No one told
them there would be a second
band. The grain party at the Pa-
villion was supposed to start at
4. It started at 2:30 and the
servers were out of ice by 4.

The Ring-tum Phi called for ‘‘a
little extra planning and care” in
the future, predicting that “With-
out these elements the weekends
will degenerate into nothing.”

Apparently the Dance oard
listened the next year. The Ring-
tum Phi chose to cover more

Fancy Dress themes over the years have run from “Mardi Gras” to
“Love-in” to the medieval decadence pictured above. Revelers in

for action by the people;
and in a realistic sense it bk
good that the politicians of ‘76
keep up the tradition and place
it at the highest priority. Every
one knows it’s not the truth, but
we all wish it were. It is equally
relieving to hear our would-be
President verbally trying to take
the White House off the throne

Carter, too, is the most political
of the "76 politicians. He ha
been running for President sine
before his Keynote address at the
1972 Mock Convention. to rank
him right behind Sen. Jackson
and Gov Wallace's marathon
campaign pace. In that time

relevant and important issues dur-
ing the next school year, but
there was one editorial in the
month of February lauding the
Board’s treatment of the tradi-
tional ball as a “crashing success.”
The editorial did not say what
produced the crashing noises, but
it did say, in a prophetic ending
“We do hope it isn’t the last

one.” It almost was.
The New York Times ran a
longer article than the Ring-tum

Phi the next year to announce the

news: no Fancy Dress. The
school paper said there was too
little cash, according to the Dance

no time, due to the ‘reorganization
of the school year.

 

T. S. Eliot once said that “Be-
tween the idea and the reality...
falls the shadow.” The lack of a
January vacation—the traditional
time for Fancy Dress—was a good
idea to use to explain the lack of
a ball. The lack of money was
a harsh reality. But who can deny
that there was a shadow over col-
lege life in general at the time
following the Kent State slaugh-
ter. And who can deny that there
was a shadow on W&L following
the postponement of some classes
and exams the Spring before to
allow students to spend their time
protesting the Indochina war.

That’s the way it was, Septem-
ber 1970. And that’s still the way
it was in January of 1971, when

‘

Palace. Although this year’s whoopee-making is not expected to
match the grandeur of the 1948 Ball pictured above, it should

prove a vast improvement over the rock and roll

as non-candidate

differ-
made on two

io time. NBC reported a
ence in comments
consecutive days.

At Christmas-time, Washington
politicoes were wondering if
Caiter headquarters had the
depth, and a grasp of the broad
Presidental concept, to coordi
nate a nation-wide effort

Now those doubts have turned
to amazement. Ond the key may
be Carter's ability to heed the
advice of a marketing service
once used to improve the ratings
of television stations and pres

entiv hired to improve the rat

ings of a would-be President
Whether these actions will lead

to the nomination is questionable.

The more a candidate becomes
the frontrunner, the more the
pres: will serutinize the coments
cnd eections of that candidate
Carter will have to hold the line
on 4d loble-talking a task he
might not be able to handle.

If ‘72 was the year of the
‘ounce and liberal, surely ‘76
could be the year of the market

ers and public relation firms.

the headline on the only
Dress story of the year
“Fancy Dress Dies Quietly.”

Fancy
read,

The story was different in
February of 1972, when a trium-
phant headline read, ‘Fancy

Dress RETURNS!” There is no way
to theorize on what was on the
minds of W&L students that year:
the intent of the weekend was
too obvious. The first four-hour
grain party was held that year,
followed by a four-hour “Fancy
Dress Concert.” The required ap-
parel was black tie and students
had only one alternative. Their
choice was to dress in t-shirts and
greasy hair; in short, to dress
like the band.

Who was the band? you ask.
Would you believe Sha-na-na?
This was a long way from Glenn
Miller and we are somewhat leery
about calling it a Fancy Dress.
The nostalgia of the 1950's may
p-esent a lot of flash, but there is
very little in it that could be
called faney

The next year the Ring-tum Phi

reported that the only person
wearing a tux at the “Fancy
Dress” concert was the drummer
for Daddy Rabbit. The Rabbit

played one night and Billy Pres
ton the next. Things were not
geting any fancier.

The rest is anticlimatic. Some
one got the fine idea of reshaping
the Danee Board into a Student
Activities Board, perhaps _ be-
cause students acted more than
they danced, and the newly form
ed SAB announced in the Fall
that the theme for the ball would
be “The Land of Oz.”

Somewhere in the interim, the
theme was changed to “Mardi
Gras” and Oz was reiegated to a
tairwell on Main St. and a float
in the Mock Convention parade.
3ut was the Mardi Gras success-
ful? Well, someone dumped a
pitched of beer on the Head of
President Huntley and someone
painted Ol George bright blue.

\nd then last year, everyone
vot drunk and danced.

Washington and Lee’s basket-

13-72. Over the holidays, the Gen-

February

26, 1976

erals beat the second-place VCAA
team, Hampden-Sydney, before
losing away games to Randolph-
Macon and Allentown College.
The win over Eastern Men
nonite was the Generals’ 17th vic-
tory against only four losses. It

A winning season

$y KENNETH MASTRILLIL
The W&L wrestling team finish-
d up the regular season with an
mpresive victory over Swearth-
aore College. Unfortunately, they
ost two meets to Temple and
Jelaware University. The loss to
‘emple must be viewed in light
f the fact that Temple has also
eaten Yale, a team which is
anked in the top 20 nationally.
yelaware simply overpowered the
renerals by a seore of 31-6.

The win over Swathmore gives
he Generals a winning season for
he second consecutive year. The
‘in was a total team effort, over
nother team which had a 9-1-1
ecord and was expected to roll
ver the Generals. With the score
6-15 in favor of the Generals,
‘reshman Dan Kniffen scored a
in the 2nd period of the final
1atch of the evening to give the
renerals a 22-15 victory. Kniffen
as done an outstanding job for a
reshman while posting a 15-9
ecord.

But the season is not over for

everybody. VCAA champ Jim
Crytzer has merited an invitation
to the NCAA meet for College
Division I. Crytzer has a 16-6 rec-
ord. He has excellent chance of
placing in the national meet.

Jim Crytzer was the leading
point scorer for the Generals this
year followed by Dan Kniffen and
Kevin McFadden. The Generals
will only lose two members
through graduation, Lee Keck
and Rick Heldrich. Assistant
coach John Spears commented
that “by and large it was a suc-
cessful year even though I thought
we would do better; we started
out with the strongest team we've
had in 3 years but we had a
couple of costly injuries which
hurt us badly. Andy King, who
was a state champ in high school,
was out half of the season with
a nagging head injury is just one
example.”

Because they will only lose two
members of the squad, Coach
Franke expects the team to have
a strong season next year.

was the second time this year
W&L had beaten Eastern Men-
nonite. The first time it took two
overtime periods, however, and
the Generals only won by a point.

W&L won the second Eastern
Mennonite contest by 21 points.
Four Generals finished with
double figures: John Podgajny led
with 18 points followed by Norm
Kristoff (12), Pat Dennis (11) and
Dave Leunig (10).

February 14, the Generals
traveled to Hampden-Sydney.
W&L played two good halfs of
basketball and beat the Tigers,
73-68. Head coach Verne Canfield
was pleased with the effort and
said the team played very well.

Ed Tiernan of H-S led all scor-
ers with 20 points while Podgajny
led the Generals with 18. Jeff
Baum added 14 points followed
by Mike Wenke (11) and Don
Berlin (10).

W&L had a tough time against
Randolph-Macon College February
18 in Ashland, The Generals trail-
ed most of the game and ended
up losing by 25 points, 90-65, at
the buzzer.

Captain Podgajny again led
W&L in scoring with 18 points
followed by Chris Larson (11) and
Wenke (8).

Allentown College edged by
W&L, 60-58, February 20. Can-
field was disappointed in the Gen-
erals’ performance but pointed out
that several players were sick
with a virus. Freshman Dave
Leunig was too sick to play at
all. Chris Larson led W&L in
scoring with 16 points while Krist-
off added 10.

Canfield was satisfied with the
Generals’ season this year. “The
boys have accomplished far more
than people thought,” he said.
The Generals’ coach was disap-
pointed, however,
support from the student body.

The Generals, now 18-6, took on
Maryville College last night. The
season final comes Saturday night
against Madison College in Har-

shows, musical merriment
will be provided by Phil Kap-

theaterlike setting with old
newsreels, cartoons, and, with
luck, dim lights.

—even the side dining rooms
will be decorated in lounge

Major scenes of activity will be
the Cockpit and the Dining Hall.
Returning to W&L two years after
its last record-breaking appear-
ance is the Norman Bennett
Group, better known as the Dixie-

land Bearcats. These Tidewater
jazz artists will play in the Pit to
the mellow accompaniment of
gently flowing beer, both from
the taps and on the floor.
Highlighting the evening, and
in keeping with the traditional
spirit of Fancy Dress, the Fabul-
ous Jimmy Dorsey Orchestra, con-
ducted by Lee Castle, will pluck
the heartstrings of every little girl
and boy with their sweet swing

style. Mr. Castle has been describ-
ed by his promoters as the “third
son” of the Dorsey family, and by
Jackie Gleason as “Prince of the

Trumpet.” His group will perform
in the Dining Hall, where, coinci-
dentally, most of the beer will be
served.

Annual Red Cross blood
drive today in Doremus

The W&L Republicans and the
Sigma Chi fraternity are sponsor-
ing the Washington and Lee Blood
Drive today in the Old Doremus
Gym from 10 to 4.

Mike Powell, chairman of the
annual event, is hoping to collect
175 pints this year. “This is a
worthwhile community effort,”
Powell said. “I hope everyone will
turn out.”

The process is painless, and only
takes a few minutes. Red Cross of-
ficials suggest eating a full meal
before coming to give blood.

This is the seventh annual W&L
Blood Drive.

for fifteen minutes, and already
I had received the summons. Why,
then, may the residents of Jack-
son Ave. park on the wrong side
of the street whenever they wish,
and leave their cars parked for
extended periods?

I am certain that the answer
lies in the fact that these people
are Lexington residents, and not
W&L students, for I have often
seen patrol cars and the Cushman
vehicle on Jackson Ave., and the
police always seem to be looking
in the other direction.

I therefore decry strongly the
attempt of the Lexington City
Police to provide for the city’s
inhabitants the constitutional
principles of “Liberty and equal-
ity for all.” It seems to me that
the good citizens of Lexington
often forget who is (indirectly)
responsible for the very food on
their tables.

Francis J. Merkel, Jr.

Tranquility, gentility
of law school praised

Editor, the Ring-tum Phi:
This is a copy of a letter that
I have sent to Mr. Peyton Neal,
head Law Librarian of your Uni-
versity’s law school. The back-
ground is this: after attempting
to do research on a textbook I
am writing at another institution,
and meeting with a variety of
problems and some treatment that
I did not appreciate, I had the
company for which I am writing
my textbook ask permission for
me to carry on my work at
Washington & Lee. The permis-
sion was granted, I came down,
and was treated beautifully.
Please print the enclosed copy
of my “thank-you note”; I wish
to make my appreciation public,
and I think that your University’s
people should have an occasional
overview of how others see you.
Sincerely,
Christian S. White IV, Esq.
Senior Instructor of Law
The Delaware Law School
of Widener College
Mr. Peyton R. Neal,
Head Librarian

Letters To The Editor...

Washington & Lee University
Law School Library
Dear Mr. Neal:

I am very much in your debt
for the cooperation and courtesy
shown towards me by the Wash-
ington & Lee Law Library in this
past month. I found the staff to
be uniformly polite, helpful, tol-
erant and enthusiastic. I found
the resources available to be com-
pletely sufficient. The people with
whom I dealt were highly com-
petent.

I made use, of course, of the
original law library facilities of
Washington & Lee University.
These facilities, particularly
Tucker Hall, the main building,
were possessed of charming, graci-
ous interiors, architecturally indi-
vidualistic in style; a most at-
tractive compounding of South-
ern Plantation Regency and Beaux
Arts to arrive at a comfortable,
interesting pattern of decor and
space structuring, with a notice-
able lack (to my mind, a highly
desirable lack) of spaces so huge
as to dwarf a person and make
him feel ill-at-ease. In all, Tucker
Hall is an easy building in which
to relax and to concentrate, and is
so without being boring: a very
considerable achievement.

I believe that the ambience of
the building had the effect of re-
inforcing Washington & Lee’s tra-
dition of gentility. The members
of your library  staff—profes-
sionals and students alike—are all
obviously gentlefolk, and their
help, attitudes, and skills all help-
ed to make my period of labor
in your law library a most enjoy-
able and fruitful experience. |
hope that the move to your new
law school will not destroy or
weaken that spirit of gentility;
such a spirit is a precious re-
source, deserving of very effort
to preserve it in an age so con-
spicuous for its uncaringness

rigidity and vulgarity.

I found my visit in your facility
most pleasant, as you may have
gathered, I was made to feel at
home as I have rarely been at
any other institution, and re-
ceived all the help I needed. I
found myself in the midst of a
gentle, humane and lively insti-
tution, as gracious as it was
effective. You have my congratula-
tions on the spirit you have
helped to create among your
people, and my sincere thanks
for permitting me to benefit from
that spirit.

For the future, I hope that the
Washington & Lee law school as
a whole, and its law library in
particular, will remain a_ place
where visiting law professors will
be welcome to come in to do re-
search .. . and where, on cold
nights, a certain bird-dog of the
pointer persuasion named ‘Bev’
will be permitted to come in and
warm up. Such small matters are
a large portion of the humaneness
of any institution, and your
establishment possesses them in
full measure.

Again, my thanks and my con-
gratulations. With every hope that
none of the good things about
your situation will change, I re-
main

Your sincere well-wisher,
Christian §. White IV, Esq.

set up in the Co-op, the quadran-
gle in the old dorms, and the lob-
bies of Washington and Tucker

Election rules, laid out for the
candidates Monday night by Vot-
ing Board chairman Bill Kerr, are
about the same as in past elec-
tions except that the number of

ed to in the past as “campaign big-
gies,” is left up to the discretion
of the candidates instead of being
limited by the E.C.

spend $15 in their campaigns for
the general election. Spending

limits and other regulations for
the run-off, should one become
necessary, will be decided at next
week’s E.C. meeting. The run-off
itself is tentatively scheduled for
one week from today, but may
still be changed at the discretion
of the E.C,

Candidates are required to limit
the number of campaign posters
to 50, including poster-platform
displays at fraternity houses. No
posters are allowed on the Colon-
nade.

Candidates whe do not turn in
financial statements by Sunday
night at 7 p.m. wiil be removed
from the ballot.

Huntley, McDowell, MacNelly,

and Breslin to lecture

The Contact °76 symposium
moves into high gear in the next
seven days with four speakers
scheduled in three varied but
promising presentations. The
speakers are W&L President
R.E.R. Huntley, Richmond Times-

Dowell, Richmond News Leader
cartoonist Jeff MacNelly, and au-
thor and columnist Jimmy Bres-
lin.

Huntley is not the first mem
ber of the W&L faculty or admini-
stration to appear in conjunction
with a Contact program, but the
Contact committee feels that his
speech tonight wil be the most
important ever made by a mem-
ber of the W&L community dur-
ing the symposium.

Breslin’s books include Can‘t

REVIEWandOuTLooK "The candidates’ platforms

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
March 4, 1976

It’s election time

It's one of those times of year again that leads us to say
“it’s that time of year again.” By now the bulletin boards have
been plastered four times over with chartreuse and passion
pink posters, fraternity types and freshmen have been sub-
jected to overblown rhetoric during meals, and a certain few
smiling faces are more visible than ever in the Co-op, In other
words, the “Big Three” election is fast approaching.

In glaring contrast to previous years, every race is con-
tested; instead of exciting one-man races we have two exciting
tandem contests and even a three-way campaign.

For the office of student body president we have candidates
Scott Franklin and Tom Hunter, both rising seniors in the un-
dergraduate school. Both have been involved in campus poli-
tics for some time, although Franklin has maintained a high-
er profile (which may or may not be an asset).

The contenders for the post of vice-president include San-
dy Stradtman, “Swede” Takacs, and Rob Daniels. Stradtman,
already a member of the Executive Committee, holds the ad-
vantage, although Takacs with his Continental perspective and
Daniels, a fresh face in campus politics, could pose a semi-
serious threat.

And then there is the race for secretary, Jim Koch and Rog-
er Durham have squared off in this battle — Koch has been a
class officer; Durham is the dark horse.

There is a disturbing note in this whole affair: every can-
didate is a rising senior. The obvious implication is that there
will be no holdover talent for the following year in the top
offices. While not a serious threat to the continued mainte-
nance of our student bureaucracy, the lack of rising juniors or
candidates from the law school is not a favorable trend,

No burning issues are apparent this year: the definitive co-
education vote has been taken by the Board of Trustees, the
$5 proposal died a deserved death, and no one has proposed
any sweeping changes in the Honor System. It appears that the
issue of the day may be the candidates’ stances in regard to
yrain parties.

The lack of definition among the various contenders may
unfortunately precipitate a (not unusual) lack of interest in
the proceedings on the part of the general student body, We
hope that this does not occur, Even if there are no flamboyant
characters running for office, who advocate the abolishment of
Wednesday classes, we should still vote. That way, when
next year's Executive Committee censures the drama depart-
ment or forms its umpteenth committee, we can say “I voted
for the other guy.”

Tinseltown revisited

The salute to Hollywood on Friday night was a smashing
success. Several chairs, a few false partitions, and some silk
wallpaper were smashed or ripped; about 1300 members of the
W&L community and their dates were in similar condition by
night’s end.

The 69th annual Faney
startling finesse, and Student Activities Board co-chairmen

Dress Ball was executed with
Clark Thompson and Terry \twood, as well as their diligent
flunkies, should be commended. From the illuminated marquee
and oscillating skylights to the giant slides of Bogie and Gre
ble and Spanky and Kong, with all the live entertainment in-
between, the Student Center had nearly something for every-
one (except perhaps a life-size poster of Marilyn Monroe),

Ticket sales were between 1000 and 1100 (as of the
meeting Monday night final figures were not available), Gross
receipts were higher than expected, although expenses outran
estimations also. By the final accounting it appears that Faney
Dress will have cost slightly less than anticipated after ticket
sales are subtracted,

\ few errant partygoers arrived sans appropriate formal
wear: in most cases these were admitted, The SAL did turn
away a few souls who were wearing denim jackets or sport-
coats. Some individuals were spied at the ball wearing tennis
shoes beneath their flashy tuxedos, and a few dates wore
pants suits or cocktail dresses. Probably 956, of those in at
tendanee were in the correct attire for the occasion, which is
consoling to the traditionalists among us. We do hope that
next year 1006; will be appropriately clad, including faculty
members,

Susan Ford and her coterie of not-soeseeret service men pro
vided a little extra spice, not only Friday night but throughout
the weekend, Her visit was purely for the fun of it, and we
have been assured that she was not here to bug the Mock Con
vention offices,

\ good time was had by all...

Fellow Students:

This Monday you will be asked
to participate in the election of
the student body officers who will
represent you on the Executive
Committee next year. This is your
opportunity to voice an opinion on
issues which are of central im-
portance to all of us within the
W&L community. And as a can-
didate for Student Body Presi-
dent, I want to listen to any sug-
gestions you might have while at
the same time answering any ques-
tions you may have of me particu-
larly.

The primary thoughts when
choosing student body officers
should focus upon, I think, which
candidate will best represent your
opinions and fulfill the respon-
sibilities of the position. This en-
tails having probably, experience
with the Honor System and the
mechanics of the student govern-
ment in general. This permits the
President to guide the members
of the E. C. in their day-to-day
workings and better organize long
term projects — essential skills
for the man to have who fills the
office of President. These are sim-
ply strengths, much like that of
possessing a knowledge of the pro-
cedural aspects of honor trials,
etc., which allow the President to
more effectively carry out his re-
sponsibilities. Being a mediator is
only one duty of this office: the
President should be able to direct
the Committee from a base of ex-
perience.

Three years on the Executive
Committee have provided me
with a familiarity, and under-
standing which 1 think will be
tremendously helpful in fulfilling
my obligations if elected. I have
a practical understanding of the
committee system, for example.
In my three years here, I have
seen different approaches to the
decision-making process, heard
numerous honor cases presented
to the E.C. and learned firsthand
about the responsibilities of the
President. I would be able to be-
gin work with insight, with the
members of the Committee begin-
ning in September. This time,
which otherwise would be spent in
learning the “ins and outs” of
our student government here, will
be free so that I can direct atten-
tions to the concerns of all of us
within the community.

For instance, my attention can
be immediately turned to the even
further strengthening of the Stu-

dent Activities Board so to better
offer both direct student involve-
ment and input in the form of sug-
gestions. I see the need for yet
more energies to be expanded in
town-gown relations. This liaison
is invaluable and must be more ef-
fectively utilized. And especially
important will be the President’s
ability to retain the undergradu-
ate communication with the law
students as they move to Lewis
Hall.

An effective orientation to the
Honor System for freshmen must
be carefully planned and thought-
fully brought off. And a similar, if
not, more in-depth orientation
must be provided for first-year
law, transfer, and exchange stu-
dents. But to do this, the Presi-
dent must believe in what he will
tell these students and be able to
convey his thoughts convincingly
— an understanding stemming
from direct involvement on the
E.C. seems almost essential for
this.

I recognize my duties to the
Executive Committee, the Student
Body as a whole, but also the over-
riding obligation to meet the con-
cerns of each student individu-
ally. And I sincerely believe my
willingness to assume these duties
at any personal cost and my past
direct involvement of three years
on the Committee can enable me
to more effectively and respon-
sibly represent Washington and
Lee as Student Body President.
Thank you very much.

Fellow students,

The position of President of
the Student Body at Washington
and Lee, with its attendant re-
sponsibilities, is directed toward
the maintenance of a_ strong
Honor System. The President, as
a member of the Executive Com-
mittee, must possess a degree of
dedication, a sincerity of purpose,
and a familiarity in the process of
student government which will re-
sult in an effective Honor System.
In the past, while serving in the
office of Junior Class President
and Sophomore Vice-President, |
believe that I have attained the
qualities which would make for
an able Student Body President.

Further, I believe the office of
President provides the best oppor-
tunity for the implementation of
several policies. The financial sup-
port of groups which are of inter-

Letter To The Editor

Editor, the Ring-tum Phi:

Perhaps you have an explanation
as to what is wrong with the mem-
bers of the Student Activities
Board. Early in the Fall term a
music preference poll was con-
ducted by the SAB. The results in-
dicated that 60.2% of the stu-
dents polled preferred rock music,
23% preferred soul and 16% pre-
ferred country rock.

When this poll was conducted.
our faith in the members of the
SAB was momentarily renewed;
it appeared as though they intend-
ed to be democratic for a change.
They are to be commended for
booking both a rock and a soul
band for Homecoming Weekend.

However, it is now evident to
us that the SAB members have de-
cided to blatantly and unjustly
ignore the results of their own
poll!! Fancy Dress Weekend left
60°% of the student body musically
alienated; a much more appropri-
ate tithe would have been Fancy
Soul Weekend. We would have
preferred silence over the Mar-
vellettes and the Drifters. In our
oninion, if the SAB intends to con-
tinue to ignore the musical taste
of the majority of the student
body, all of their funds should be
allocated to the film committee,
and for grain parties open to the
entire student body.

Otherwise, the “activities fee”
should be discontinued and the

SAB should be dissolved. We sin-
cerely hope that there is no truth
to the rumor that the Spinners are
being considered for a Spring con
cert; what a worthless waste of
our money that would be!
Personal opinions aside, it is
obvious to us that when the mem-
bers of the SAB have a number of
bands under consideration for a
ziven event, they should poll the
student body beforehand. The
SAB clearly has no right to disre-
gard the musical tastes of the vast
majority of the student body.
Sincerely,
—William E. Birbick

The choice of The Drifters as the
grain party band was not made
by the SAB, but by the freshman
class, who were the sponsors of
the party. Grain parties are al-
ready “open to the entire student
body,” and it appeared to us that
no one at the parties (concerts in
question was sulking in the corner
over the music. (Music at a grain
party is of secondary importance
in any case.) In the past the rock
concerts brought to campus have
been less successful than soul con-
certs; however, your suggestion
for a poll on specific bands is a
reasonable idea.

Fellow Students:

The office of the Vice-President
of the Student Body is a position
which carries with it large respon-
sibilities. And, as such, it must be
occupied by someone who is well
qualified to hold that position. But
of at least equal importance, I
think, is a dedication toward the
responsibilities entailed. Through
my involvement with the Exe-
cutive Committee not only as a
class representative but as a stu-
dent body officer, I have become
quite familiar with the duties of
the Vice-President. And, | want
to do the job as best I can, a de-
dication that comes from my pre-
vious involvement.

The Vice-President is account-
able for the responsibilities allo-
cation of all student body funds.
He is a member of the Faculty
Executive Committee and is now a
voting member of the Alumni
Board of Directors. Of equal im-
portance, he is the technical ad-
viser to the accused during honor
trials. The candidate you vote for
must be qualified to fulfill at
least these duties.

The thoughts which I want to
leave you with are very simple
and, more importantly, I think,
they do not commit me to pro-
posals which I cannot singly in-
stitute: if elected, I will honor-
ably assume the responsibiliities
before mentioned, and, in so do-
ing, I will act in the best interest
of you whom I represent as effec-
tively as I know how. I made this
same promise to you last year and,
with all sincerity, my duties as
Secretary have been first in prior-
ity throughout the year. The same
will be true next year should I be
elected.

As you might recall, the one
specific promise I did make last
year was to better familiarize
members of our community with
the particularities of our Honor
System. To effect this, excerpts
from the Honor System White
Book have appeared regularly in
the Ring-tum Phi. And I have con-
tinually tried to increase my
awareness of the advantages and
problems of honor systems in
general by attending relevant con-
ferences—notably, spring discus-
sions at the University of Virginia.
The insights I gained there and
the suggestions that were offer-
ed have greatly helped me in
dealing with the specific problems
of our system here.

In essence, what I can bring to
the office and offer to you is ex-
perience, a desire to do my best,
and a promise to give all the time
necessary to effectively fulfill my
responsibilities.

“Swede” Takacs

In the fall of 1974, I had the
privilege to come to W&L to get a
dose of American campus life. Al-
most two years later, the expo-
sure has generated some reac-
tions. I am sorry to note that con-
cern with student government has
been on steady decline since the
early 70’s. The per cent of the stu-
dent body voting in a campus
election is below 50.

What, then, has caused this sit-
uation?

I would, without any hesitation,
put the blame on election prac-
tices employed by candidates in
the past. Every year, at election
time, the hopeful few dig up some
“hot” issues to campaign on.
Whether they can actually deliv-
er on the promises is not viewed
as essential because the main
thing is to win the election, with
the fundamental assumption be-
ing that once you are elected, your
problems are over, whereas that
actually is just the beginning of
the process of governing. Year
after year, candidates commit the
cardinal error of overseiling hot
issues, raising peoples’ expecta-
tions and in the end creating dis-
appointment. Apathy _ results.
Faith in democracy must rest on
something Abe Lincoln said: “You
can’t fool all the people all the
time.”

Presently, candidates feel pres-
sure to provide controversial is-
sues and patent answers, regard-
less of their values, as long as
they sound good. After election
day, the great silence falls and dis-
appointment rises proportionally.
Apathy grows. It is unfortunate,
since it allows the emergence of a
clique, running the E.C. year after
year in splendid isolation. The sit-
uation has created numerous
“E.C.-majors,” siting out their col-
lege years in the Student Center
with their records mostly unques-
tioned and their reelection apa-
thetically approved.

Pluralism makes democracy.
Democracy, when operating
smoothly, must constantly find
room for people below who are
pressing their way up.

It’s with this in mind I’m run-
ning for Vice President of the E.C.
The primary function of the E.C,
is to uphold the Honor System,
which I believe is in danger unless
an effort is made by the commit-
tee to generate wide spread inter-
est on campus for student govern-
ment. I cannot and will not pro-
mise what I am not sure I can
keep, but I promise to work hard
to bring the issues of student gov-
ernment out to the student body
and thereby avoid friction be-
tween the E.C. and different in-
terest groups. Otherwise clashes
are bound to occur. The creative
freedom of the University Theatre
is an issue of concern, The Minor-
ity Affairs Coordinating Commit-
tee is in my opinion a piece of
scamping and unless its represen-
tatives are given voting rights on
the standing committees, time will
inevitably show its low value.
These are two things that interest
me and which could be worked
out rather easily.

Furthermore, I believe | have

March 4, 1976

Lacrosse season has begun

By BILL FLESHER

Spring began at Washington and
Lee at 2:05 p.m., February 28,
1976.

No, there wasn’t a sudden blos-
soming of leaves prompted by a
new discovery made in Howe Hall.
Nor was the first day of spring
moved upon executive order from
a W&L administration member, a
visiting Secret Service agent, or
Arthur Ponzarelli (and if you don’t
know who he is, well, “Hey, you’re
not cool.”),

Understand if you will. Spring
at W&L officially begins when the
referee, even if he is a W&L law
student, blows the whistle to start
the first official lacrosse activity
of the year.

All right, so it was a scrimmage,
and so it was intrasquad. That
makes no difference, for with that
first faceoff another Generals’ la-
crosse season, and another Wash-
ington and Lee spring, was under-
way.

The Generals have made the
spring months most enjoyable the
past four years, qualifying each
year for the NCAA Lacrosse
Championship tournament.

Since the arrival of head coach
Jack Emmer in Lexington in the
summer of 1972, W&L has com-
piled a three-season record of
40-9, and has annually appeared
in the NCAA semi-finals, only to
lose to the eventual national
champion each year.

Whether the spring of 1976 will
be as pleasant remains to be seen.
The Generals play 13 games and
two exhibitions this year, a busier
schedule than most teams but a
light one for W&L in comparison
to their 19, 17, and 21-game slates
of the past three years.

Defending national titleist Mary-
land, which eliminated the Gen-
erals from last year’s tournament,
is the big addition to the regular
season schedule (May 1 at College
Park). Other new opponents are
Virginia Tech (March 31 in Lex-
ington) and a traveling team of

Norberg selected
best performer
at indoor relays

Washington and Lee freshman
Jack Norberg (of Valley Forge,
Pa.) was selected the Outstanding
Performer as the Generals finish-
ed a close second in the Lynch-
burg College Indoor Relays last
week,

Norberg ran on three winning
relay teams, was on the long jump
relay team that finished second
and the mile relay team that plac-
ed fourth.

W&L also got outstanding per-
formances from team captain
John Tucker, who ran legs on
three winning relays and partici-
pated with the long jump team
that finished second, and weight-
man Phil Dunlay who won both
the 35-lb. weight throw (52 feet,
3 inches) and the shot( 42 feet,
11 inches).

The Generals swept the weight
throw, with Dunlay, Bob Propst
and Hank Phillips finishing 1-2-3,
while Dunlay and Steve Schwei-
zerhof were 1-2 in the shot.

Host Lynchburg College won
the overall competition with 56
points, folowed by W&L with 47.
Others competing were Bridge-
water, High Point and Francis
Marion.

NCAA: Wé&L out, Shepherd in

By SAMMY THOMPSON

Washington and Lee’s basket-
ball Generals’ chances of receiv-
ing a post-season National Col-
legiate Athletic Association (NC-
AA) tournament bid this year are
slim at best.

The Generals split their last two
regularly scheduled games of the
season, beating Maryville College
and losing to Madison, giving
them a 19-7 record for the year
and a 13-1 mark in Virginia Col-
lege Athletic Association (VCAA)
competition.

This record was enough to give
the Generals the VCAA crown.

As a result of W&L’s fine sea-
son play, the Division Il South
Atlantic regional committee voted
unanimously to send the Generals
to the basketball playoffs—which
start March 11.

Nevertheless, the NCAA cen-
tral office in Kansas City has de-
cided, so far, not to give W&L a
bid. Instead, bids were given to
Monmouth College of New Jersey,
Lynchburg College, Shepherd Col-
lege and Glassboro State.

Both Monmouth and Glassboro
State deserved a bid. Lynchburg,
which W&L lost to by one point at
the beginning of the year and beat
by six points the second time, got
a bid automatically by winning
the Dixie Conference. Shepherd
got the bid with a 29-2 record.
This, however, is where the ques-
tion mark comes in.

According to the W&L coach-
ing staff, Shepherd might be in-
eligible for the playoffs because of
suspected NCAA violations.

The first alleged violation is
perhaps the number of games
Shepherd played this year, NCAA
rules state that a Division III team
can play a maximum of 26 games.
Three of Shepherd's games are ex-
cluded from this rule, however.
This would leave them two games
over the limit if they did in fact
play 31 games.

W&L head coach Verne Can-
field had to drop the alumni game
and a scrimmage to comply with
this rule.

Another possible violation has
to do with when Shepherd start-
ed the season. The W&L coaches
said Shepherd may have started
too soon.

The “NCAA Division III Basket-
ball Handbook 1976” states that
Shepherd “is not eligible for post
season competition.”

Several things have been done
to protect Shepherd's selection in
the tournament,

But the NCAA central office of-

inch. The only concession they
have given is that they will invest-
igate the matter with Shepherd
next month at the national meet-
ing.

This will be too late for W&L,
however, because the tournament
is in two weeks.

An NCAA spokesman said, how-
ever, that W&L’s chances of re-
ceiving a bid are not closed.

Captain John Podgajny doubts

Rugby club seeks official support

By KEN MASTRILLI

The W&L Rugby club is about
to embark on probably its biggest
season to date. With a fine crop of
outstanding freshmen and a num-
ber of veteran upperclassmen the
team hopes to provide the Uni-

very slim,” he said, “of getting a
bid.”

Podgajny said he was disap-
pointed with the NCAA’s action
concerning Shepherd .He said he
thought suspected violations were
brushed under the rug by the
NCAA for convenience sake.

Podgajny summed the whole
thing up saying, “It stinks.”

If Shepherd had been disquali-
fied, chances are good that the
Generals would have gotten a
NCAA bid.

W&L certainly had a fine sea-
son ,compiling a 13-game winning
streak and winning the most
games since 1967 when that team
also won 19.

The Generals’ 19th victory came
Feb. 25 against the Maryville Col-
lege Scots in which W&L trounced
their opponent, 110-82.

College co-ed.

versity with but another one of
the entertaining activities which
the springtime always manages to
produce.

Due to some heavy recruiting
by last years’ members of the
freshman class, the team hopes to
build the program into one that
the student body will be proud of,
a program that the team hopes
will be supported wholeheartedly
by both administrators and other
school officials who had previous-
ly doubted the viability of the
club as an entity which merited
recognition.

By incorporating members of
the student body, especially in the
ranks of the underclassmen, the
club hopes to gain this official if
not vital recognition. The paln
calls for the gradual takeover of
the administrative duties of the
club to be placed eventually in
the hands of the underclassmen
in hopes of eventually ridding the
club of the so-called “stigma” of
domination by the law school
members and also in hopes of at-
tracting more underclassmen to
join the club.

The club would like to invite
the student body to its first match
of the year. The match will be
held somewhere on the school
grounds, but owing to some sche
duling problems the exact site has
not yet been determined. The
game will be played on March 13,
which is a Sunday, at 1:30 p.m.

Richmond compiled 361 points,
VPI - 305 and W&L had 259.

The Generals were led by sen-
ior Billy Cogar who was a double
winner in the one- and three-met-
er diving events. Cogar easily
qualified for the Nationals with
his performance.

Sophomore John Hudson won
first place in the 1650 freestyle
event though he swam with an
illness,

W&L also qualified both their
400 and 800-yard relay teams in
the Nationals.

Tad van Leer and Keith Romich
were individual qualifiers for the
Generals. Van Leer qualified in
the 50 and 100-yard freestyle and
the 100 butterfly and Romich met
the 200-yard freestyle require-
ments.

VCU was tough for the Gen-

UC passes new frat statement

(Continued trom page 1)

mouth.” The Council decided to
let S.A.C. look into the matter.

Several members raised objec-
tion to the first paragraph of the
statement, which served as a very
general introduction. After some
discussion of this, Professor Bu-
ford Stephenson suggested that
the Council was making “moun-
tains out of molehills.” He con-
sidered the paragraph to be in-
nocuous.

The Council finally approved
the statement 13-1-3. This means
that it is now official policy, since
the University Council exercises
supervision over fraternity af-
fairs.

The statement reads, in part:

Social fraternities at Washing-
ton and Lee are a valuable and in-
tegral part of both the University
and Lexington communities; as
such, fraternity chapters have im-
portant privileges, as well as re-
sponsibilities to those communi-
ties.

As a particularly visible part of
the Washington and Lee commun-
ity, fraternities—through the ac-
tions and conduct of their mem-
bers—reflect directly upon the
University and affect its efforts to
attract new students and to main-
tain active alumni support. Also,
because chapters are located in
the residential areas of Lexington,
such actions and conduct affect
the city and its residents.

Chapters therefore are expect-
ed to maintain adequately the
physical appearance of fraternity
property and to assure the struc-
tural integrity of chapter houses.
Chapter members are expected to
conform to standards of gentle-
manly conduct and to exhibit a
concern for the rights and sensi-
bilities of others.

To ensure continuing supervi-
sion of these matters, the Student
Affairs Committee, upon the re-

It is expected that fraternities
will comply in a responsible man-

From “The White Book”

“The accused student must be
informed of his status with a brief
description of the offense . . oe

“The witnesses are informed of
their status and kept separate
from each other and from the stu-
dent suspected .. .”

The E.C. is of the opinion that
honor hearings in which both the
accused and any witnesses have
the least specific knowledge pos-
sible about the case tend best to
be the fact-finding investigations
they are meant to be. A typical
charge served to an accused stu-
dent might specify that he pos-
sibly cheated on a certain test giv-
en on a particular day. Any evi-
dence is generally presented at
the hearing to best elicit the facts.
Witnesses are kept separate to
reduce inadvertent collaboration.

Fellow Students:

This coming Monday, you will
have the opportunity to cast your
vote for three members of the
W&L community whom you be-
lieve can most effectively repre-
sent your views on the Executive
Committee. The officers you elect
must be able and willing to con-
vey your concerns. Most impor-
tantly, they must be ready to ac-
tively do this.

Neither myself nor my oppon-
ent have served on the Executive
Committee. However, through my
work as a class officer and mem-
ber of the Student Control Com-
mittee the past three years, I have
learned a great deal about the
inner workings of the University.
My responsibilities have necessi-
tated my gaining an awareness of
the mechanics of the government
here and—most importantly — I
have dealt with people in these
positions. I believe I know what
the majority of students feel and
the problems we all encounter
here. This understanding is what
I would bring to the office of Sec-
retary. | would hope that this
kind of understanding would per-
mit other students to feel more
comfortable in coming to me with
suggestions and concerns.

An awareness of needs, how-
ever, is not all that is required.
The Secretary must be willing to
put in long hours of what is often
tedious work. Therefore, it was
only after learning about the re-
sponsibilities and giving careful
thought to the duties entailed in
the position that my decision to
seek election was made.

I have learned that promises
committing an entire body for
something simply cannot be made
and I refuse to do so. But a pro-
mise to devote my time and do my
best, if elected, can be made. I
will willingly commit myself to
this.

Your decision is an important
one: Please evaluate all candidates
with care. Should you have any
questions for me, I will be cam-
paigning all week on campus.

Thank you.

Respectfully submitted,

and Norm Kristoff played their
last home game in a Generals’ uni-
form, Podgajny received a stand-
ing ovation when he fouled out of
the game with two minutes left.

Podgajny led the Generals in
scoring that night with 30 points
followed by Bob Flint (15), Pat
Dennis (14), Kristoff (12) and
Chris Larson (11).

Maryville’s Randy Lambert led
all scorers with 31 points.

Against Madison, W&L led most
of the first half, but allowed the
score to be tied at intermission,
30-30.

Midway through the second half,
the Generals turned the ball over
10 out of 12 times and Madison
took the lead by as much as 11
points with eight minutes left to
play.

W&L narrowed the lead to five
points with a full-court press, but
time ran out and Madison won,
70-65.

Madison’s Pat Dosh led all scor-
ers with 26 points while Podgajny
and Larson had 16 points each for
W&L.

Podgajny’s point total left him
just 16 points short of reaching
1,000 career points. The 6-foot-2
senior captain averaged about 18
points for the season to lead the
team in that department.

Podgajny also was the Generals’
leading field goal and free throw
percentage shooter, defensive re-
bounder and leader in defensive
recoveries. He was voted most
valuable player in this year’s W&L
Invitational Tournament.

With these credentials, Podga-
jny has an excellent chance for an
All-American selection. Hopefully,
he will have better luck at this
than W&L did in receiving a
NCAA bid.

Recruitment and releases

(Continued from page 1)
cedure by reorganizing the Media
committee. Braun was put in
charge of news releases and Hat-
chett was given the job of recruit-
ing national press.

Everyone lived happily ever
afier until the Mock Convention
signed up Sen. Dale Bumpers to
speak to the convention delegates.
Someone at WLUR learned of the
MC plans and called Bumpers’ of-
ties to conifrm the facts. The
station’s news department broke
the news sometime before the
MC wanted it known.

Bumpers’ appearance was an-
nounced on a Friday afternoon.
Tuesday night following the an
nouncement by WLUR, Boctsie
Hatchett came to the Ring-tum
Phi office with a hastily-prepared
news release telling us what we al-
ready knew. It turned out the
Media committee had beer reor-
ganized once again and Hatchett
was now in charge of getting out
the news. That is how the commit-
tee stands at present.

Hatchett reports that his other
job. bringing in the press, is still
up in the air to a large extent
right now, and the process o fget-
ting people here is entering what
he calls the “crunch-month.” The
Virginia press will be well-repre-
sented and Hatchett says that peo-
ple he has contacted in the com-
monwealth are helping him con-

tact other journalists.

He said David Broder gave him
some advice on the matter during
the journalist’s visit this year.
Broder told Hatchett not to be too
psyched about having a lot of peo-
ple covering the general cam-
paign showing up here since that
was one of the few weekends be-
fore the California primary comes
off and the campaiga goes wild
{hat the newsmen can spend at
home.

So it appears, according to Hat-
chett as well as Morgan, that the
reporters here from the national!
press, if there are any, will come
from a class referred to as “se-
cond-stringers” by Morgaa. Tiere
is also the possibility that the
couvention will be covered after-
the-fact, as if was in 1972 by ‘Time
and CBS.

The outcome of Hatchett’s at-
tempts to make sure that the MC
maintains its national reputation
this year, and the success of
Braun’s campaign to bring a few
lovely faces here to brighten up
the floor are two factors that are
still up in the air right now. But
it would probably be safe to bet at
this point that the Media commit-
tee will have some measure of tri-
umph in the end result, After all,
with the number of revampings
the committee has seen, the law
of averages is on their side.

The press

try’s politics think the press
fell down badly in the 1972
Presidential campaign. They
believe (they)...did compara-
tively well in covering the
Democratic candidate George
McGovern. But they hang their
heads in shame over what they
regard as notably a poor job
in reporting on the Republican
candidate Richard Nixon.

The race for next year’s secre-
tary is being decided in a run-
off today between junior vice-
president Jim Koch and E.C.
junior representative Radar Davis,
a write-in in Monday’s election.

The voter turnout, one of the
largest in recent years, was ex-
panded by a large number of
persons mobilized in the law
school by Hunter’s supporters.
Hunter’s vote alone, 610 to Frank-
lin’s 350, was almost as large as
the total number of voters, about
650, cast in the last Big Three
election. The unusually high num-
ber of votes may also have been
increased by the presence of 175
students in Woods Creek who
were not living on or near campus
last year.

of the on-the-air statment, sta-
tion officials extended invitations
to the other two candidates for

the afternoon after Tackas’ talk,
but winner Sandy Stradtman re-
spectfully declined.

The only close race Monday
was the competition for secretary.
Radar Davis joined the race as
a last-minute write-in after de-
ciding not to go after the v.p.
slot, and managed to win only
two fewer votes than Jim Koch.

The E.C. voted Monday night
to allow Davis’ name to be placed
on the ballot in the run-off, even
though he did not formally file
for candidacy by petition. There
is precedent for such a move ac-
cording to Bobby Pugh, and be-

Freshmen goals stable;
legal careers favored

More than a quarter of this
year’s freshman class—four times
the national men’s average—say
they intend to become lawyers,
according to a 366-college survey

Almost 20 per cent reported
they plan to enter business, slight-
ly above the national average
figure for male freshmen, and 16
per cent, more than double the
national average, said they plan
to become physicians or dentists

The proportions are roughly
the same as they have been each
year since 1970. The survey is
taken each fall by the Washing
ton-based American Council of
Education with the cooperation of
the University of California at
Los Angeles, and survey results
are compiled both for every indi
vidual college and for the nation’s
freshmen as a whole. The na
tional averages are broken down
as well by sex, permitting a com
parison of W&L's all-male fresh-
man class with the rest of the
nation’s male freshmen

In total, law, business and medi
cine account for 63.3 per cent of

the career choices at W&L—but
only 30.8 percent among male
freshmen nationally, the survey

showed

Politically, the complexion of
the entering class this year is
almost exactly the same as it was

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
March 11, 1976

Almost 1000 votes
a new trend?

The election for student body officers turned out to be
quite interesting, after the fact. For a race in which there were
no significant issues a significant portion of the W&L student
body voted, and for that we are delighted. Perhaps we are
finally making some headway against apathy.

Scott Franklin lost to Tom Hunter in the presidential race
by 27 percentage points, a substantial margin. It has been
pointed out to us that not in recent memory has anyone been
on the Executive Committee for three years and then succeed-
ed in a bid for one of the three top spots. While Franklin was
suffering with the flu late last week and his campaigning lag-
ged, a considerable amount of the vote for Hunter must be
seen as an anti-"E.C, major” vote, as another candidate put it.
Hunter parlayed the support of those who like him, those who
dislike the current E.C., and those who dislike Franklin for
one reason or another, into a substantial victory.

The race for the number two seat was extremely interest-
ing. While Sandy Stradtman, an E.C. representative for two
years, won his bid for the position, the anti-establishment sup-
port for “Swede” Takacs was considerable. Takacs, who col-
lected 34% of the vote to Stradtman’s 57%2%, campaigned on
the slogan “Flunk E. C. majors.”

His support came from those who feel the E.C, has lost
touch with the average student, that the same students keep
running for office, and that those who run for office decide
among themselves ahead of time who will run for what posi-
tion. In short, Tackaes’ received the protest vote, against the
system, but mostly against the individuals in the system.

The race for secretary is being decided in a runoff today
between the two front-runners, Jim Koch and “Radar” Davis.
The point to note about Monday's results in this contest is
that Davis received only two votes less than Koch's 331, even
though Davis was a write-in candidate. evidently the voters
did not attach the same stigma to Davis as they did to Frank-
lin and Stradtman, although Davis has been serving on the
K.C. this year. It seems logical that the “anti” vote in this
election was registered in the 26% received by Roger Durham,
whe did not make it to the run-off.

It still bothers us that no sophomores ran for the major
positions, particularly for student body secretary. Next year
will be the first time in over four years that the secretary has
not been a member of the junior class. The class of ‘77 seems
quite political, and it is a safe bet that a large number of those
who lost this week will run for senior [..C. representative on
March 22nd; that election has the potential of becoming a

W&L-style Kentucky Derby,

This was the first set of student body elections since the
opening of the Woods Creek apartments. Although no one
can be sure just what percentage of the Creekers voted, or
which candidates they supported, it is safe to say that the er-
fect of the apartment complex on the turnout was significant,
Those residents constituted a block of 130 voters that were
easily accessible to the candidates during the week of cam-
paigning, and because of their proximity to the main campus a
high portion of their number voted in all likelihood,

All told, 960 students east ballots on Monday, out of an en
rollment of approximately 1000, That converts to exactly 60%,
Ina year when government (at least student government) has
not been held in highest esteem, it is gratifying to note that
00% of the students at WAL even bothered to vote
almost become legendary for our apathic attitude with regard

we have
to the vote. Maybe this is the start of a trend toward more
student involvement in student government, at least one day
a year.

Local citizen replies to allegation

of bias by the Lexington police force

Editor, the Ring-tum Phi:

I am writing in response to a
letter which appeared in the Feb.
26, 1976 edition of the Ring-tum
Phi concerning a questioning of
Lexington’s parking regulations,
signed by Mr. Francis J. Merkel,
Jr. To begin with, I am a resident
of Lexington and am responding
with all due respect for the gen-
eral student body of W&L.

Quoting a portion of Mr.
Merkel’s letter that distresses me:
“It seems that the good citizens
of Lexington often forget who is
(indirectly) responsible for the
very food on their tables.” Here,
he is referring to Lexington de-
pendence upon the existence of
Washington and Lee.

Hopefully, this attitude is not
representative of the W&L stu-
dent body as a whole. Seemingly,
Mr. Merkel has not resided in
this city long enough to realize
the economic complexities that
are characteristic of this area.
The sun does not rise and set
over “Old George” for a great
deal of Lexington’s citizenry.

Assuredly, the working people
of this city and county earn their
livings in a variety of ways (many
of which are in no way associated
with Washington and Lee). And,
as some of you may realize, Rock-
bridge County is presently ex-
periencing the most widespread
recession-related unemployment
of any area in the state of Vir-
ginia. Of course this problem
would be even more severe with-
out Washington and Lee. But who
provides the food for those who
have been laid off from their jobs?

In the midst of all this we see
no outward financial problem be-
setting W&L. May I suggest that
Lexington’s problems, advantages,
and population be examined by
those people who have criticisms
so they may become familiarized
with the community before draw-
ing conclusions.

Also, I am not aware of any
conspriacy aimed at W&L stu-
dents on the part of the Lexington
police force, an accusation which
appeared in Mr. Merkel’s letter.
Lexington has a reputation for
having one of the lowest crime
rates of any city of comparable
size in the country. Someone is
then obviously doing something
right.

As a resident for several years,
I too have been ticketed on oc-
casion for breaking city parking
regulations. Even though they did
seem like trivial matters to me as
well, I did break the law. I saw no
acknowledgement of that fact any-
where in Mr. Merkel’s letter. Up-

Tim Bays
well worth

By FRITZ GOLDBERG
Music Editor-at-large

I hardly paid attention when
someone told me last fall that
the SAB was going to be bring-
ing live music to the Cockpit. At
the time, the only time the Cock-
pit brought any serious thought
from my addled skull was when
I pondered the beer prices and
their relation to Gerry Ford's
economic program.

But that was before I sat down
in the Pit one night and began
talking to a stand-up comic with
a guitar, That was before a morose
and started not getting along with
flutist sat down behind the piano
the SAB. That was before a good
old boy from Yonkers and a couple
from lLforget-where spread their
musical word through the Cock-
pit.

So why did I write all those
and why am I writing this one?
Because when someone makes any
noise more blatant than a drunken
grunt in the Pit, it is time some-
one sat up and paid attention.
This especially true of Tim Bays.

This is no drunken grunt we
are hearing through the SAB’s
fancy sound system this week.
This is a Bacchic scream, a per-
former who has something to say
to all those out there who would

on breaking a law one must be
willing to pay the consequences,
naturally.

If Mr. Merkel is perhaps dis-
appointed with the law as it now
stands, then I suggest he take the
matter up with our mayor (a
W&L professor) or members of
Lexington’s city council (several
are directly associated with Wash-
ington and Lee).

It is becoming more apparent
that Mr. Merkel did indeed violate
the law. As a matter of fact he
might be classified as an habitual
offender. Perhaps, he is flattering
himself by claiming that the police
department is following a policy
of harassment of W&L students.
I think it was just a question of
being in the wrong place at the
wrong time one too many times.

The people of this city are not
to blame, nor is the police de-
partment. Mr. Merkel, you your-
self are to blame for not taking
a little extra time by placing the
nickel in the parking meter or
parking in the proper direction.
There would not be any problem
at all if you had acted within the
law in the first place.

Another point deserves atten-
tion too. Mr. Merkel insinuated
that the Lexington city police
were not providing equal treat-
ment for the city’s inhabitants
overall. However, Mr. Merkel’s
explanation for his failure to pay
one of his parking tickets on
time was due to the fact that he
was a W&L student, had a tight
schedule (it was in the middle of
a mid-term week), and _ thus
couldn’t concern himself with
such trivial matters (it slipped his
mind). Well, such a matter may
seem trivial to him but I am sure
that the people who make their
living by enforcing the law might
not agree.

What I find incredible though,
is that the gist of Mr. Merkel’s
letter was the lack of “liberty
and justice for all,” yet he acts
as though he should deserve
special consideration or special
attention in not being able to
pay his fine on time simply be-
cause of his tight schedule at
W&L. What would have happened
if he would have had to appear
in court? Did Mr. Merkel bother
to inform the police department
concerning his schedule conflict?
Maybe they would have under-
stood the problem and offered a
suggestion. A “tight schedule” is
not a legitimate excuse.

I get the impresion though, that
basically the problem is one of
a lack of understanding. Certain-
ly, one’s college experience in-

rather laugh about the back seat
of a ‘57 Chevy than talk about it
in mixed company. This is a
man with a good deal of social
comment of the sort W&L men
should appreciate, a musician
with music that acknowledges
that the back seat and “green
beer” have a place in the Ameri-
ean culture,

And lest I forget that I am
supposed to be a critic of music
and not culture, and that Tim
Bays sings about more than back
seats, I should add that the
music is very good as music, as
well as social comment.

Bays has a monologue that laces
through his songs, a monologue
that slices through everything
from grandpa’s suicide to his
sweetheart’s wig, a running train
of anecdotal and commentative
humor that picks you up by your
psychic bootstrap and carries you
to a spot several segments re-
moved from where you were a
minute ago.

And lest we forget that this man
is supposed to be a musician, you
notice that the monologue would
be a monotone if there were not
something there to add to the
words, to embellish the stream of
thoughts. There it is, resting on
his leg, a guitar that surpasses

volves more than what is learned
in the classroom. “College ex-
perience” implies a maturing in
attitude regarding associations
with one’s fellow man. Not just
with fellow students, but also a
genuine attempt at building an
understanding of those outside
the immediate realm of associa-
tion within the community. An
attitude of narrow-mindedness
can only have a damaging effect
on school-community relations. It
is a two-sided affair and all who
are involved must learn to bend
a little.

However, after reading such
drastic statements in Mr. Merkel's
letter I must respectfully resent
any inference on his part of (even
indirect) superiority regarding my
dependence on him or Washing-
ton and Lee for my well-being.
Certainly, W&L has always been
a significant asset to this com-
munity and without its presence
Lexington would exist in a wholly
different capacity than its current
state. But it would exist, and I
am sure there would still be
enough food to go around.

Again, I am writing with all due
respect for Washington and Lee
and the student body. Thank you
very much.

Sincerely,
Michael Patrick St. Clair

Editor’s reply:

Agreed, W&L does not put the
food on the table for everyone in
the Lexington-Rockbridge area,
although a significant portion of
the economy is tied to the Uni-
versity (which, by the way, does
have its share of financial prob-
lems).

Agreed also that one must be
willing to accept the consequences
of one’s actions. We believe that
Mr. Merkel was not attempting to
relieve himself of any guilt, but
was questioning the rationale be-
hind the zoning of the street on
which he resides for two-hour
parking only.

Because he has received two
tickets does not make Mr. Merkel
an “habitual offender”; if two
summons constitute evidence of
a habit, you yourself could be so
classified.

The question is not whether a
law was broken or who is to
blame, but why the law exists in
its present form. We must admit
that at times we are at odds to
reason why parking regulations
are what they are. An example:
The zoning of Lee Avenue be-
tween Washington and Nelson
Streets. Perhaps a council mem-
ber could explain to Mr. Merkel

is a Cockpit musician
listening to for awhile

most anything we've heard in the
Cockpit this year, following the
man’s fingers through the strang-
est twists and turns and then slid-
ing into the scheme of things
when the man gets around to
singing a song, or finishing the
one he’s working on.

Now do you understand what
the music of Tim Bays is doing
in the Cockpit? Do you under-
stand what this itinerant folkie
is all about? Somehow, | didn't
think you would. But at least
you can go into the Cockpit with
a little bit of background and
perhaps enjoy the music a little
more. And when you applaud,
stop and ask yourself what you're
clapping for, or what you're laugh-
ing at, and maybe you'll enjoy the
performance just a little bit more.

Bays will be performing in the
Cockpit this evening at 5:15 and
at 9 p.m. Tomorrow and Saturday
performances are scheduled for
7, 9, and 10:30 p.m,

the reasoning behind the Me-
Dowell Street zoning. Perhaps we
should attempt to write a feature
article, so that students may
understand the problem of zoning
and be more sympathetic to the
city.

As for police harassment,
while it is not the rule, there
have been incidents of which we
have knowledge that could be at-
tributed to harassment, by police
of students and vice versa, (Lex-
ington’s crime rate is so low that
its policemen have time to seek
out all parking offenders or just
cruise around.) We hope that those
incidents were just _ isolated
events, and that the Lexington
police force is even-handed in
its administraion of justice.

Letter to

March 2, 1976
Editor, the Ring-tum Phi:

This past weekend I had the
pleasure of attending the Faney
Dress Ball at W&L. The decora-
tions, bands, entertainment, and
refreshments were excellent, and
the whole theme was carried out
to perfection. | had a great time,
and would like to congratulate
the Student Activities Board on
a job well done.

I have one complaint, however,
and hope that the Board will take
it inte consideration next year.
I did not think that beer, or any
other beverage should have been
allowed on the dance floor, Drink-
ing should have been limited to
the table areas, only. It was ex-
tremely messy, and when every-
one is dressed in tuxedos and
gowns, | do not think that there
should have been the risk of hav-
ing someone slosh his drink all
over another person. It reminded
me of a grain party, and spoiled
the otherwise beautiful setting
Perhaps the clean-up committee
would agree with me that the
beer and other drinks should
have remained at the tables.

Thank you,
Sheila A. Buck

N.C. State, Duke trounced

By BILL FLESHER

Imagine that Washington and
Lee’s season opening lacrosse
games had been played on friend-
ly Wilson Field rather than on
Tobacco Road last week.

Think what the scene would
have been as the Generals got
their first goal of the year. On
the field the players congratulate
the goal-scorer. In the stands, the
fans, among other things, strike
up a chorus of the W&L Swing.

And from the pressbox comes
the announcement of the goal:

“Generals’ goal scored by num-
ber 24, (pause), Tom Keigler???”

Seeing may have made believ-
ing easier, but it really did

happen. It was the junior de-
fenseman Keigler—not Donny

Carroll or Rob Morgan or even
Charlie Brown—who opened the
scoring in W&L’s 20-3 romp over
North Carolina State Friday.

Not to be outdone, senior All
American defenseman Rob Lind-
sey retaliated with a goal of his
own the next day as the Generals
walloped Duke, 19-8.

Neither of the lopsided wins
was unexpected, since North Caro-
lina State and Duke are regarded

as the weakest of the Atlantic
Coast Conference lacrosse teams.

Eighteen W&L players hit the
scoring column in the two games,
led by junior midfielder Jack
Dudley’s nine goals and two
assists.

Dudley, who totalled just 14
points last season, scored five
goals and two assists against the
Wolfpack ,and came back with
four goals against Duke.

Senior attackman Donny Carroll
took the team points lead with
four goals and nine assists (five
against N.C. State) in the two
games.

The Generals took a 3-0 first
quarter lead against N.C. State
on goals by Keigler, Jay Sindler,
and Charlie Stieff.

They stretched the margin to
6-1 at intermission, the sixth goal
coming on a Rob Morgan shot
just one second before the period
ended.

W&L then scored six straight
goals in the third quarter, three
of them by Dudley, before the
Wolfpack’s Mike Cunningham
could get State’s second goal.

After trading scores early in
the final period, the Generals reel-

Who’s playing where

A position-by-position look at
the 1976 Generals:

Attack: W&L wil carry seven
attackmen this year, all of whom
Emmer says can contribute.

The attack will be centered
around tri-captain seniors Donny
Carroll and Rob Morgan, the
team’s top two scorers in 1975.

Carrol! (85 points last year; 185
during his career) earned third-
team All-American honor last
year. Known as one of the best
“feeders” in the nation, Carroll
will continue to work from be-
hind the goal while Morgan (53
goals and 78 points in 1975) will
again play crease attack, although
Emmer did not rule out the pos-
sibility of Morgan moving behind
on certain occasions.

Emmer says that freshman Jeff
Fritz will fill the hole created by
the graduation of Dave Warfield.
A quick and aggressive player,
Fritz should give W&L an ex-
ceptional riding game.

Emmer will also have freshman
John Black and sophomore Sandy
Bishop available as behind attack
help, while senior Jim Englehart
(nine goals last year) and junior
Boyd Martin (eight goals, in-
cluding five against Duke) will
back up Morgan.

Midfield: At season’s end last
year, the only midfielder who
wasn’t expected to be back this
vear was Ken Miller, who gradu-
ated five days after the Maryland
game

Since then, however, transtes
and the plain old desire to sit
out the season has cost W&L
seven middies, including the
“Manhasset” line of Scott and
Ralph Baugher and Jay Mona
han, and faceoff specialist Brent
Miller

Many W&L lacrosse followers
are worried about a lack of ex-
perience at midfield, And, as
Emmer admits, the midfield was
the biggest question mark area
before practice began

The most experienced midfield
consists of junior Jack Dudley and
sophomore Jay Sindler and Char
lie Stieff. Dudley (14 points in
each of his two seasons) is a two
vear starter who Emmer calls
one of the steadiest players on
the team.”

Sindler, who possesses the hard
est shot on the team, could de
velop into a premier offensive
threat. according to Emmer, who
ealls Stieff (the leading ground
ball man at midfield last year
with 90) “W&L’'s best defensive
middie.”

\ second unit is made up of
ophomore Mark Derbyshire and
freshmen Bryan Sibson and Chris
Kearney, a converted crease at

case with Miller last season.

None of this includes Chris
Larson, W&L’s sixth leading
scorer last year with 20 points,
who will join the team within a
week of the end of the basketball
season. It would be safe to say
that Larson will find a spot in the
top three midfields.

Defense: With five of the top
six defensemen returning from
last year’s squad, W&L’s reputa-
tion as a strong defensive club
should be continued.

All three starters are back —
first-team All-American Rob Lind-
sey, third-team A-A Tom Keigler,
and crease defenseman John
Strock.

Lindsey, who, like Carroll, is
in his second year as a tri-captain,
will again draw the assignment
of stopping an opponent’s high
scorer, according to Emmer.

The senior defenseman is best
remembered for his performances
against John Hopkins, in which
he shut out two allegedly un-
stoppable attackmen, Jack
Thomas in 1974, and Mike O'Neill
last year.

While Lindsey is known for his
man-to-man play, Keigler is re-
cognized as the best stick-handl-
ing defenseman in the country.

“He’s the best I’ve ever seen,”
says Emmer of the junior’s ability
to handle the ball. Keigler has
led the Generals in ground balls
in each of his two seasons at
W&L (107 in 1974; 188 last year).

While Lndsey and Keigler get
much-deserved publicity, Strock
gets little if any. But as Emmer
and Strock’s running mates
argue, almost everyone is over-
looking a very talented lacrosse
player.

“John is a very steady player
who does everything’ well,”
Emmer says. “There is no doubt
in my mind that John is a better
player than some of the other
defensemen in the nation who
get a lot more publicity than he
does.”

The defensive talent does not
end with starters. Emmer says
that junior Steve White and senior

Dave (call him Weeb) Eubank
will see extensive action
Emmer indicated that White

and Eubank may anchor a de-
fensive midfield, a tactic the Gen
erals used quite successfully
against Johns Hopkins in last
year’s NCAA playoff game

Also an the squad are two
freshmen defensemen Jack
Wileox (from Atlanta, another
new locale for a W&L lacrosse
player) and Ed Grandes, who will
miss several games with a muscle
problem in his lower back

Goal: In sophomore Charlie
Brown, W&L has not only one of
the best netminders in the nation
but also a true offensive threat
who spends most of his time in
side the crease

Brown's 75-yard goal against
Johns Hopkins will undoubtedly
eo down as one of the great
moments in W&L sports history
However don't expect too many
long-range bombs this year

Opposing coaches came to re
spect Brown for his ability to
move the ball down the fleld last
vear. He came close to scoring

ed off seven goals to record their
highest one quarter goal output
since 1974 (11 against Franklin
and Marshall).

It was much the same story the
next day. W&L grabbed another
early lead (5-0 at the quarter) and
controlled the rest of the penalty-
filled game (11 against Duke;
seven against W&L).

Dudley picked up three goals
before halftime (11-3), while Car-
roll tallied two of his three goals
in the third quarter.

Duke’s Mike Heldeman match-
ed Dudley with four goals.

W&L goalie Charlie Brown was
sharp in both games, with 18
saves against North Carolina State
and 13 in less than three quarters
of play against Duke.

As for W&L’s offensive defense-
men, Keigler scored his first goal
for W&L on a hard shot after a
full-field clear against N.C. State.

Some players, however, say
Lindsey’s goal was not a shot but
a pass to Morgan on the crease.

Lindsey would not comment on
the matter, saying only, “It went
in, didn’t it?”

Meanwhile, John Strock, the
third starting defenseman, says

and why

Emmer says that Brown is well
ahead of where he was last sea-
son. He adds that the sophomore
has finally made the adjustment
to college lacrosse, which Brown
admitted last year is “just a little
bit different than the high school
game.”

Backing Brown up are junior
Bill Cole and soph Julian (from
New Orleans) Good, both of
whom played junior varsity la-
crosse last year.

he’ll get his goal in due time.

W&L takes on the powerful
Mount Washington Lacrosse Club
in Baltimore Saturday.

The Wolfpack is the defending
club lacrosse champion. Their
roster is not dotted but filled with
All-Americans.

Several W&L lacrosse alumni
are playing for Mount Washing-
ton this year, including Dave
Warfield, Bryan Chasney, Sam
Englehart, and Skip Lichtfuss.

The Wolfpack stopped Virginia

“Butch” ran effective campaign

In a system where the monet-,
ary matters of a committee are
handled by the _ vice-president
(which gives him something bet-
ter to do than wait for the presi-
dent to kick off) it takes a coura-
geous man to run for the post of
“treasurer.” But Butch Clark was
up to the job and managed to
run one of the most successful
campaigns in recent Washington

and Lee history, striking down all
opponents to win the seat he
sought by a 15 vote margin.
Butch, born Ivan Edward in
1955 (but was like any good W&L
man, unable to live with the name
Ivan), is an English major from
Chevy Chase, Md. who did not
campaign very hard, as some of
his opponents tended to do, be-
cause he thought students were

Committee, the major reason they
failed was because McGovern was
not taken seriously in the media
in the Spring of ’72.

The other aspect of the national
press is coverage of the conven-
tion itself. The media department
of the Mock Convention is trying
to have press representatives on
hand to follow the May event. The
convention media people are tell-
ing correspondents that their col-
legiate work is the most accurate
in the Nation. So far, the re-
sponse has been better than in
past years. The reason for this
change lies in the new attitude
of reporters, as Ms. Toni Roades,
Press Secretary for the Demo-
cratic National Committee said,
“The Mock Convention is what
correspondents are searching for,
a reliable exercise that tries to
play like a real conventions works.
It will be popular with the press
because it is not a poll.”

Solons reverse decision
on senior law franchise

By JOE FITZGERALD

In a special hour-long meeting
Tuesday afternoon the Executive
Committee voted 6-5 to allow
third-year law students to vote in
next year’s election.

The vote followed a 9-1-1 deci-
sion the night before to disen-
franchise the seniors in Tucker
Hall. Tuesday’s vote allows the
seniors to cast ballots Monday for
the student who will represent the
law school on the E. C. during
next Fall’s budget hearings and
this Spring’s committee selection.

The matter of seniors voting was
brought up before Monday’s E.C.
meeting by Channing Martin,
freshman law representative to
the E.C. and candidate in the up-
coming election for upperclass
law school representative.

Dave Cranshaw, one of Martin's
opponents in the campaign, ac-
cused Martin Tuesday of a “con-
flict of interests” in bringing up
the issue during the race. Accord-
ing to E.C. president Leland Me-
Cullough, allowing the third year
students to vote would “do in”
Martin’s campaign.

Martin cited his “duty” to clear
up the discrepancy between vot-
ing rights in the senior classes of
the law  and_ undergraduate
schools. He said the issue was
brought up during the campaign
because that is the only time any-
one thinks about election rules.

Martin was against letting the

seniors vote in both meetings.
Senior law representative Clendon
Lee was the only one opposed to
the disenfranchisement in the first
vote. He was joined on Tuesday
by McCullough, Sandy Stradtman,
Bobby Pugh, Billy Webster, and
Jim Underhill, all of whom were
originally against the seniors vot-
ing (except Webster, who abstain-
cd from Monday’s vote).

Before Tuesday’s vote law stu-
dent Hal Clarke presented a peti-
tion bearing the names of 135 law
students who wanted the issue
decided by a referendum in the
law school before the election.

Clarke cited the fact that even
though the student body constitu-
tion gives the E.C. the power to
decide the rules of all E.C. elec-
tions, the E.C. has given the law
school the right to govern its own
elections in the past. According to
Clarke, “The E.C. is going out of
its way, without really recogniz-
ing it, to antagonize the law
school.”

Tom Sansonetti, president of
the Student Bar Association, also
mentioned the E.C. right to de-
cide election issues, but added,
“They should not shirk that duty.”

E.C, junior representative Scott
Franklin agreed, calling the inde-
cision on the part of the E.C.
“poor.”

Radar Davis, the other jr. rep.,
said that many undergraduate sen-
iors assumed that they could not

vote in class elections. Sr. rep.
Bill Garrison also cited the diff-
erence between at-large elections
for Big Three seats and class elec-
tions for representatives and of-
ficers.

Clarke answered that the repre-
sentative for the upperclass law
students is closer to the Big Three
elections in concept than to the
class elections.

Pugh, in making the motion that
the E.C. reverse its decision of
Monday night, said that the E.C.
had thought the issue was “low-
key” when the original vote was
taken. He said that considering
the issues of personality involved,
the E.C. should let tradition stand
for the duration of the present
campaign and make a permanent
decision on the matter after the
election.

Students depict Founding Fathers

By GRAY COLEMAN

The University Theatre’s pro-
duction of 1776 by Peter Stone
and Sherman Edwards is schedul-
ed to open next week for a three-
night run (Friday, March 26 thru
Sunday, March 20) in Evans Din-
ing Hall.

Dr. Al Gordon is directing the

ADCO posts record profits for year;
“management” pleased with simulation

By the News Staff

“Advanced Communications,
Inc., has announced record earn-
ings for its fiscal year just ended.
Net income jumped to $200,000
from the $5000 of the previous
year. Return on investment leap-
ed from 1% to over 16%, a ratio
thre times the industry average.”

ADCO, as its management likes
the company to be called, does
not really exist on the open mar-
ketplace. But it has been a quite
real corporation to five commerce
students for the past six weeks.
Those students participated in the
Emory Business Game, a comput-
er-simulated program that allows
students to conduct a “business”
in competition with students in
other coleges.

This year’s team finished the
program in second place in their
division, which included Wake
Forest, University of Baltimore,
University of Dayton, W&M and
VPI. Wake Forest placed first,
and went on to take the national
competition,

The students, John Swanson,
Mynders Glover, Phil Hanrahan,
Jay duRivage, and Mark Maurais,
were quite pleased with the final
results. After a slow start in the
wame, the team managed to man-
euver their company into a posi-
tion (o take full advantage of
some market conditions that other
colleges did not anticipate.

What really helped the crew
though, was their formal presenta-
tion (a sort of Stockholders’ Meet-
ing) in the final get-together in
Atlanta. Thirty percent of the
rating given to each team by the
judges is determined by the pre-
sentation, and the W&L group
picked up 27 points here.” “The
team did quite well in handling
the report,” commented the fac-
ulty advisor to the group, Dr.
Joseph Goldsten.

Members of ADCO’s “board of
directors” feel that W&L’s strong
showing provided graphic evi-
dence of the strength inherent in
the W&L business program. “We
were fortunate to represent W&L
——we learned first-hand the true
value of a W&L education,” said
Glover.

While many teams stumbled

when questioned by the judges on
various points about their firms,
the W&L students were quick to
present the correct figures and ex-
plain their significance .

On a seale of 100, W&L receiv-
ed a total of 70.5 points, compar-
ed to Wake Forest’s 73.5. W&L's
bad start in the three-year simula-
tion hurt them, but the fact that
they pulled through in the third
year, plus their expertise in the
presentations, gave them some
favor with the judging panel,
which included Emory professors,
acountants, bankers and corporate
executives.

Other colleges and universities
which compete in the annual pro-
gram include Auburn, Rensselaer
Polytech, Georgia Tech, Vander-
bilt, VCU, and about two dozen
others.

show, with assistance from music
director Dr. Gordon Spice. The
dining hall was chosen as the set
for its large seating capacity and
appropriate decor. The congres-
sional chamber, designed by Wal-
ter Romanchuk, blends with its
surroundings to a great degree,
and utilizes many period pieces,
such as quill pens, inkwells, bam-
hoo fly-swaters, and so forth.

Briefly, the plot revolves around
the actions of the Continental
Congress in the summer months of
1776, up to the signing of Declara-
tion of Independence. The pivotal
character in the movement for
freedom is John Adams of Massa-
chussets (played by Rob Mish).
With the aid of some well known
historical figures like Benjamin
Franklin (Chuck Harer), Thomas
Jefferson (Dan Westbrook), and
Richard Henry Lee (Dan Scott),
he succeeds in overcoming his
main opponents, John Dickinson
of Pennsylvania (Lecky Stone),
and Edward Rutledge of South
Carolina (Mike Armstrong).

Upon seeing the play, a large
number of people may wonder if
our country really got started in
such a way. In the words of the

authors, “The answer is yes. Cer-
tainly a few basic changes have
been made in order to fulfill basic
dramatic tenets . . . Reality is sel-
dom artistic, orderly, or dramatic-
ally satisfying. Therefore, in his-
torical drama, a number of small
licenses are almost always taken
with the strictest fact.”

Indeed, audiences should notice
that aside from the “great names”
of the Congress, there were other
heroes, not necessarily any small-
er in stature at that time, from
the truly admirable patriot, Cae-
sar Rodney (Stewart Barroll) to the
cautious James Wilson (Charles
Smith), whose last-minute conver-
sion changes the entire Congres-
sional outlook. And, finally, the
perpetual dispatches of General
George Washington, somewhere
out on the battlefields, serve to
show the emotions of those out-
side the Congress who desperate-
ly need their help.

Reservations are nevessary for
the show, and the box ofifce 1s
presently open. For seats, call the
University Theatre at 463-9111,

the W&L community are compli-
mentary.

Is Udall the new McGovern?

By PHILIP HATCHETT

At a quick glance it would seem
that Representative Morris Udall
of Arizona is all set to blast off for
the Democratic nomination. As
the campaign moved through
three major primaries, Udall
emerged as the only liberal candi-
date remaining among the five
major contenders, It’s Udall ver-
sus the  never-to-be-nominated
George Wallace, love's candidate
Jimmy Carter, the always bor-
ing Henry Jackson and sideliner
Hubert Humphrey.

Udall was the first announced
candidate for President back in
1974. With his hat in the ring
came a media bombardment of
doomed failure and skepticism.
The print claimed that his name
was not known, and his present
job (member of the House of
Representatives) was not prestigi-
ous enough to warrant voter ac-
ceptance

But since '74 Mo Udall has seen
three of the appealing liberal
candidates rise and fall on the
stomp. Shriver, Bayh and Harris,
all with bigger names and more
recognition for previous actions,
have failed to politically surface
and even take 10% of the vote
in any primary, Now their cam
paigns are bankrupt and washed
up

However Udall has shown voter
appeal, getting 24° of the vote
in conservative New Hampshire
and taking a second place to
Carter. In Massachusetts, another
red-ribbon finish was registered
with 1814 of the vote compared to
Jackson's 24%

But the Udall campaign still
appears lost somewhere between
success and failure. Instead of
standings tall like a General after
fending off the enemy, Udall looks

more like a foot-soldier suffering
and hungry and thanking God for
preserving him to starve and
suffer a little longer. Udall may
be winning some battles but he is
still losing the war of financing.
He is the poorest of the active
campaigners. The Udall for Presi-
dent Committee reports they are
about $100,000 in the hole and
that does not count all the bills
in Massachusetts. At every stop
on the campaign trail, it’s the
speech first and then the drive
for cash.

The natural tendency for politi-
cal observers is to compare the
“Udall in '76" campaign to the
McGovern movement in '72—both
share similar views, a lack of
money and even campaign per-
sonnel. Both have similar quixotic
campaign styles, which gained the
acceptance of the young in "72
and will likely repeat itself this
year.

However the analogy falls apart
on the issues: MeGovern had one,
Udall does not. The MeGovern
“eause” was to end the War in
Vietnam. Udall does not have a
war—just the three “Es”, the
Economy, Environment and En-
ergy. This shallow stance basic
ally defines him the “liberal” and
nothing more, nothing less.

This week even the word “lib
eral” was lost when he started
calling himself “progressive” in
honor of the Wisconsin primary

Where the Udall Campaign has
gotten most of its headlines from
is denunciations, especially of
Gov. Wallace. In October of ‘75
when speaking in Lee Chapel,
we heard him joking about going
to Alabama without his passport,
one of his favorite stomping stor
ies. This attitude served to capture

the intelligentsia vote (but not
their money) of the North and

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
Thursday, March 18, 1976

Who should pay?

The sophomore class settled out of court with the band
that was suing the class for damages allegedly done to its
equipment and van during the Homecoming Grain Party.
The band sought $2000 in reparation ; they are receiving $500.
The question was raised in several recent E.C, meetings as
to who should pay for the settlement: the sophomore class,
all classes together, or the E.C.?

Students buy from their officers class passes which allow
them entrance to all grain parties. Tickets, which can be
purchased by anyone, are normally sold at the “door” for
these functions. Therefore, members of any class could have
perpetrated the “damage.”

Just because the sophomore class threw the Homecoming
party does not make them more liable than other classes for
the damage. An incident of this sort could just as easily occur
at Fancy Dress or Springs. Essentially, when one purchases
a class pass one is supporting all four classes and their parties ;
each class throws a party to which other class members
bearing passes are admitted; each class reciprocates.

The possibility of the Executive Committee paying for
the settlement should not even be discussed. The student
activities fee, on which the E.C, runs its budget, is mandatory.
Class dues, on which parties are thrown and savings funds
accumulated, are not mandatory, It is then obvious that these
class funds, and not general student funds, should be used
in this case, and we feel that the E.C. was wise in not agree-
ing to pay.

Class officers have to sign band contracts in the name of
their own class, but they are assuming responsibility not only
for the actions of their classmates, but of all members of the
University. Is it fair to burden them, and the finances of their
class, with damages that cannot be traced to any individuals?

We think not. Rather than acting in the name of their
class, officers are acting in the name of all who attend these
parties, of all classes. It is therefore our opinion that all
classes should share in any extraordinary charges arising from
these parties, and we hope that in a spirit of co-operation all
class officers will agree to spread the cost of the case among
the four undergradute classes.

Our economic impact

Since our comments on this page last week concerning the
financial involvement of Washington and Lee in Lexington
were made, we have come upon some data to support our
conjecture that W&L is indeed a significant element in the
economy of the area.

According to a study conducted in 1974 by members of
the University, a study which took more than a year to
complete and was quite comprehensive, W&L was shown to
he responsible for more than 25% of the money spent in
Lexington, or $8 million out of an economy that was then
operating at an annual level of spending of $31.4 million. An
interesting fact to note is that for the year studied, the budget
for the University was about $6 million, the inference being
that for every $1 that W&L spends, Lexington pockets $1.33.
(The ripple effect of re-spending, as every student of eco-
nomics knows, accounts for the difference.)

Quoting from the report: “The analysis does not show the
political, social, or aesthetic impacts on the City of Lexington,
There is no way to measure the uncompensated services
\Iso
unmeasurable is the dimension added to Lexington because

rendered by University personnel to the community . . .

of the cultural events, athletic events, social events .. .” It
should also be stressed that the figures used in the study are
dated, and any current assessment of the situation might re-
veal a different level of influence, Also, it should be noted that
the study only dealt with the impact of W&L on Lexington,
and did not inelude data for the county,

WA&L is not the be-all-and-end-all for Lexington and its
residents, as many of them are quick to point out, It does
appear from the study that this University is one of the
largest, if not in fact the largest, “industry” in the city-county,
We hope that students do not dwell on this fact, but that
members of the community do, so that relations between
the two can be smoothed out.

The boys on the E.C.

“Money well spent.”

With that remark exit an Executive Committee member
from the University Theatre following one of three perfor-
mances of the play, The Boys in the Band.

Last month the I.C., after a lengthy and often ridiculous
debate, voted to allocate $50 to finance the production. The
play cost $80. The producer, Brian Garr, is paying for the bal-
ance. The Fine Arts department did no more than donate the
building for several days—all props were solicited from friends
and acquaintances,

Considering the conditions under which they worked, the
cast did an excellent job in presenting material that was not
quite so controversial as some individuals made it out to be.
The more progressive and open-minded members of the E.C.
should be lauded for attending performances to see what
all the furor was about, (All who saw it seemed quite im-
pressed.) Those who voted against funding the play and then
viewed the production should be lauded for having the
intestinal fortitude to attend and afterwards admit that
perhaps they had been wrong.

Those of the E.C. who abstained from the Theatre, well...

Those that did not attend will be pleased to discover that
the theatre season for next year includes a flashy superficial
Neil Simon production, and for those who wish to see a
production of Arsenic and Old Lace, don't give up—your wish
may yet come true,

Amazing

Someone who is not running for student office definitely
needs to say something about the “amazing” number of people
seeking positions of power and responsibility this week, Bill
Kerr contributed the quoted adjective there, and as head
of the Voting Regulations Board, he is supposed to know
quite a lot about elections. He knows so much that after
considering the matter for awhile he decided he would have
to print up a two-page ballot. With that thought in mind he
amended his carlier statment to read “amazing zoo,”

A lot of people have said a lot of things in recent memory
about some vague demon called “student apathy.” Apparently
this formless devil is not with us this month, Last week almost
1000 students voted in the Big Three elections and this week
there are no fewer than 50 persons running for various offices,
This number was reduced from a higher sum by the six or
so candidates who were expected to run for senior E.C, spots
but did not. Possibly they were seared away by the six who
did decide to run for those two seats.

“Seared” may become a catchword in the campaign. It will
certainly be enough to make the stouthearted tremble just a
bit to see this bludgeoning army of hopefuls hitting the
campaign trail, wherever that is. One observer at Monday's
k.C, meeting, when asked what he was running for, gazed
around for a moment at the mass of budding politicians filling
the chairs, the floor, the rafters and one another's shoulders,

and replied, “The border,”

3.5 for 32 in 48...

we

By J. G. FITZGERALD during the opening session.

Paraphernalia

Once more, to clear the air, the
title of this column is not a
whimsical item plucked from the
air to give students something to
speculate about in the midst of
an astounding drunk. The title
“3.5 for 32 in 48..." means that
the Mock Convention goes througa
three and a half years of planning
to spend $32,000 in 48 hours.

Actually not all of that money
will be spent in the two days in
May when the deal actually comes
down, but MC treasurer Bob
Ballenger says that possibly as
much as 40-50% of it will, mostly
on phones for the delegates’ use
in finding out what is going on
out there in the real world. And
not all of it will even be spent
this year. Each MC tries to leave
a little bit of cash in reserve for
the next effort and this year's
steering committee is hoping to
leave about five or six grand for
MC ‘80,

The money that is not spent on
phones or the 1980 convention is
going toward such projects as
bringing in $1000 speakers to
deaden the spirits of the delegates
and prevent the kind of frenzy
that broke out in ‘72.

And just to make gure the
delegates do not get too dulled
by the politics of the thing, the
MC will feature the lovely and
talented Miss Virginia, who will
remind the delegates of the great
responsibility laying before them
by singing the National Anthem

Money is also being spent on
various printing jobs. Last week
the first issue of the “Mock Con-
vention Swing.” a regular up-
date on various MC projects, was
produced. Also appearing was a
new flier running through such
things as the schedule for the
MC, the speakers who will be
here, the record of the MC, and
last but not least, the kind words
David Brudnoy had to say about
the whole deal in his column, If
nothing else, the flier, which folds
out into six sections, will make a
great poster for the souvenir-
conscious when the whole thing
is over.

And for those who do not like
posters with a lot of print on
them, the Mock Convention is
planning a somewhat simplified
poster for people who would
rather look than read. The poster
is expected to look something like
the cover of the MC Journal, so
as to give onlookers a frame of
reference. It is one of many
money-raising projects that will
be coming in these final eight
weeks before the convention.

Since all Journal ads were due
in four days ago, all money the
states bring in now will have to
come from donations and sales
of various MC  paraphrenalia.
Money will also be brought in by
raffles. The Illinois delegation was
running one in the lobby of the
Commons early this week, The
imagination of the delegation is

Q—Are there any ghosts in Lexington?

A—Yes, although many of them prefer to remain anonymous for tax
purposes. As you may recall, the town of Lexington was originally
layed out back in the days when a belief in the supernatural was
as socially acceptable as is placing an obscene phone call in the
Jerry Lewis Telethon today. Consequently, all the fashionable
eighteenth century families in Lexington invited local representa-
tives of the demon’s club to their social gatherings, though hob-
goblins were notoriously poor charades players and often threw
loud tantrums upon missing a clue. Gradually, this practice died
out when whist came into favor.

Here, today, in the many antebellum houses around town, an-
cestral ghosts quietly haunt their former homes, and are regarded
by their living descendents with filial pride and affection, although
occassional family disputes arise over who gets the bathroom first
in the morning. These phantoms are as much a part of the house-
hold as the antique furniture and will often balance centerpieces
and candlesticks on their heads for great lengths of time to fool

dinner guests. Indeed,

these family spooks have enlivened

many a dull alumni party with their incorporeal antics, eccentric
behavior, and an uncanny ability to win at Scrabble.

Of course, the many ghosts of Lexington do not limit their
nocturnal activities to old houses alone. Some roam the back
streets looking for odd jobs, while the more adventuresome ones
will go around ringing doorbells and then, after posing as a
social worker, vanish suddenly before the eyes of horrified resi-
dents who have just agreed to support a starving Korean family
for $1 a month and all the back issues of Esquire they can read.
At the Southern Inn, the waitress reports a misty fellow appearing
each Thursday to order the businessman’s special only to dis-
appear before the Jello is served. “He’s probably embarrassed,”
conjectured the waitress. “I notice he seems to have trouble pick-
ing up his silverware and folding his napkin.” This is thought to
be the ghost of Hawg Sorrels, late postmaster of Lexington, who
was found dead one morning inside a registered package of
lasagna on its way, air express, to Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.
Foul play was ruled out because the package had the correct

postage on it.

Q—What do you say to a ghost, if you meet one?

A—Oh, talk about the weather, or sports, general things. For heavens
sake, though stay away from Dickens. Ghosts hate Dickens. He
never gave them any speaking parts, you know.

Q—How do you get rid of a ghost?

A—-Offer him seconds on Jello.

Automobile registration reminder

All students who have motor
vehicles at Washington and Lee
and who purchased local tags in
March or April of 1975 are re-
minded of the requirement to
purchase new tags prior to the
expiration of the ones currently
displayed.

A student whose local address
is within the city limits of Lex-
ington is required to purchase a
decal from the City Treasurer’s
Office at the Lexington City Hall
on East Washington Street. These
decals, which cost $10.00 each,
are good for a twelve month
period from the date of purchase.
A student whose local residence
is in Rockbridge County is to pur-

what would happen if every one

expectations concerning pledged
work, each student has the re-
sponsibility to understand those
expectations for every assignment.

Baseball Generals opened season Tarheels could be tough

with weekend double-header win

By SAMMY THOMPSON

Junior Dan Westbrook pitched
a 3-hit shutout in the first game
and freshman Rich Wiles drove in
the winning run in the second
game to lead Washington and
Lee’s Baseball team to a double-
header win over West Virginia
Tech last Sunday.

The Generals won the first
game, 7-0, and the second, 5-4.

Westbrook, returning from last
year’s pitching staff, had little
trouble with Tech, striking out
10 and giving up only three hits.

The Generals’ offense came up

with five hits and seven walks
while the West Virginia defense

Track members
take first places

Junior Paul Thomson and fresh-
man Phil Dunlay were individual
champions as W&L placed a
strong fifth in the fourth annual
Virginia College Athletic Associa-
tion (VCAA) indoor track meet.

Thomson won the 880-yard run
with a 2:02.2 clocking, while Dun-
lay won the 35-lb. weight throw
with a distance of 53-1.

Madison won the VCAA champ-
ionship with a total of 67 points
followed by Virginia State and
Hampton Institute with 45 each,
Emory and Henry 24, W&L 22,
Lynchburg 18, Bridgewater 15
and Roanoke 2.

Law III leads

in intramurals

With five sports counted, tennis,
golf, football, swimming and the
turkey trot, Law 3 has taken a
55-point lead in the intramural
standings this year. Phi Kappa
Sigma is second followed by Pi
Kappa Alpha, Phi Kappa Psi and
Sigma Chi.

Lambda Chi Alpha recently
won the ping-pong championship
ahead of PKA, ZBT and DTD.
Phi Kappa Psi won the bowling
title ahead of PKA also.

In the wrestling tournament,
held several weeks ago, Phi
Kappa Sigma won the last match
of the night to deadlock with
Sigma Chi for the championship.
Instead of replaying the match to
determine a champion, the two
teams wil split the first place
points.

committed five errors.

Sophomore Ted Hissey drove
in the first W&L run with a triple
and that, as it turned out, was all
the Generals needed for the vic-
tory.

In the second game, however,
W&L had to play catch-up ball.
West Va. Tech took a 1-0 lead in
the fourth inning and maintain-
ed it at 4-3 going into the bottom
of the 6th. Wild pitching and a
single by Wiles allowed W&L to
go ahead for the first time.

Freshman Bruce Williams re-
placed Mike Rhodes on the mound
and saved the win for the Gen-
erals.

Senior Tommy Hudgins was in-

jured in the game when he was
hit in the head with the ball after
he stole third base. He will prob-
ably miss the next three weeks
of play.

Head coach Joe Lyles was
pleased with the wins and compli-
mented on the team’s sound play.

Last year, W&L had a tough
season with several injuries and
five cancelled games. The Gen-
erals ended up with a 3-19 record.

Today, W&L plays Providence
College of Rhode Island here at
3 p.m. This weekend, the Generals
travel to Newport News and Nor-
folk for two doubleheaders against
Apprentice College and Old
Dominion.

One of the first crucial tests
of the young lacrosse season
comes Saturday on Wilson Field
when the Generals host North
Carolina’s powerful Tarheels.

North Carolina proved it is one
of the nation’s top teams Monday
by taking defending national
champion Maryland into overtime
before dropping a 12-10 decision.

Both teams figure to be high
in the national rankings when
the polls come out next week.
W&L has not been severely tested
from a college opponent, follow-
ing romps over N.C. State (20-3),
Duke (19-8) and Morgan State (18-
3).

W&L and UNC figure to present
quite a contrast on the field.
W&L’s strength lies in its high-
scoring attack and strong de-
fense, while North Carolina’s
forte is a very talented midfield.

High expectations for swimmers

W&L will send probably its
strongest team in history to the
NCAA Division If national
swimming championships _ this
weekend in Washington, Pa.

The seven-member team is led
by five-time All-American John
Hudson, and_ three-time  All-
American Tad Van Leer. Hudson
could become W&L’s first na-
tional champion, since he has the
best time in the nation in two
events and will be the early
favorite.

Hampered in recent weeks by
a viral infection, Hudson hopes to
be fully recovered in time for the
opening events today at Wash-
ington and Jefferson College. The
national meet will continue at the
Pennsylvania school through Sat.

Hudson will swim in the 200-,
500- and 1650-yard freestyle
events, plus the 400- and 800-
yard relays. Van Leer, who also
has been fighting a recent ill-
ness, will swim in the 50- and
100-yard freestyles, the 100-yard
butterfly and the 400-yard relay.

Diver Bill Cogar, the state
champion in both the 1-meter and
3-meter events, is expected to

“They have about eight very
good athletes on their midfield,”
commented W&L coach Jack
Emmer. “Somehow we will have
to negate their midfield strength.
They are good on defense and
their attack is solid, but we think
we can handle it with our de-
fense.”

The W&L defense _ features
goalie Charlie Brown, who _ is
averaging over 15 saves a game,
All-American Tom Keigler and
Rob Lindsey, and John Strock on
the crease. The offense is led by
attackman Don Carroll, who has
six goals and 11 assists; mid-
fielder Jack Dudley (11 goals,
three assists) and attackman Rob
Morgan (six goals, six assists).
Morgan scored three goals in
Saturday’s 11-8 exhibition loss to
Mt. Washington.

In last week’s action, W&L
avenged last year’s upset by
Morgan State, and played well be-
fore losing at Mt. Washington.
Coach Emmer said he was “pleas-
ed with the result against Morgan
State, but we could play a lot
better, and we’ll have to, to win
the big games.”

The W&L coach also was
pleased with the showing against
Mt. Washington, who, he says,
“could very well be the best

lacrosse team in the country, col-
lege or club.” The Generals led
by an early 1-0 score on a goal
by Charlie Stieff, fell behind 4-1,
then tied it on three straight
goals by Morgan.

Mt. Washington, controlling
the ball, led the rest of the way,
but the Generals closed to 9-7
with three minutes to go and miss-
ed a one-on-one shot at the Mt.
Washington goalie. The Mount’s
Skip Lichtfuss, one of a half dozen
former W&L stars now playing
for Mt. Washington’s defending
national club champions, then
scored the clinching goal.

“Our overall defense, both in
the midfield and in close, played
very well the second half,” Emmer
noted, and limited Mt. Washing-
ton to just one second-half goal
until Lichtfuss’ clincher. After a
slow start initially, Brown came
on to stop 22 Mt. Washington
shots-on-goal.

Emmer also had high praise for
the starting midfield of Dudley,
Stieff and Jay Sindler. ‘‘They are
an outstanding midfield unit.”
Emmer said.

Saturday’s game could very well
be a cliff-hanger like last year,
when Carolina won, 13-12, in sud-
den death overtime. The open-
ing faceoff is at 2:00 p.m.

The Spinners signed; rock fans protest

By FRITZ GOLDBERG,
Music-editor-at-large and
JOE FITZGERALD,
Assistant News Editor

“We had two people here when
we changed the entire Honor
System,”

Mike Luttig was about ten feet
away from the press section in
the Executive Committee room
when he made that comment.
There were about 150 people in
the room when he said it.

By the time the meeting start-
ed there were an estimated 300
people and one three-legged dog
crowding the small meeting area,
and it was impossible to hear any-
thing said ten feet away.

At issue was the Spinners, a
soul band whose show includes
not only music, but impressions,
mock TV commercials, and a form

of dance that has led their many
imitators over the years to bill
their acts as “Band and Show.”

There are people at W&L who
love this type of performance for
its rhythm, its blues, and its sheer
entertainment value. On the other
hand, there are those who do not.
These two groups, the pros and
the cons on the Spinners, were
the crowd in the E.C, room Tues-
day evening.

On Monday nights, while the
E.C. meets on the first floor of
the Student Center, the Student
Activities Board meets on the top
floor. Usually there are no more
than five observers at the E.C.
meeting, excluding those having
business with group, and there
are even fewer at the SAB meet-
ing.

This week things were different.

While the SAB voted to bring the
Spinners here for Springs week-
end, about ten people, rock fans,
kept a vigil outside their office.
The rock fans were waiting to
voice their opinion if the Spinners
were chosen.

The rock fans got their forum
Tuesday. The SAB voted 7-3 Mon-
day to bring the Spinners. But
there was a catch. The Spinners
are playing at the University of
Virginia on April 24, the night

after they are scheduled to play
here. The back-to-back perform-
ances in the same area are ex-

pected to cut down on the gate
receipts here. So the SAB, after
telling the E.C. on January 12
that they might need an extra
$2000 for Springs weekend, came
back to the E.C. Monday night
to ask for that money.

The allocation was discussed in
a meeting that was described by
E.C. president Leland McCullough
as “closed” and “informal.” The
student body constitution forbids
the allocation of funds under such
circumstances, so the E.C. had to
hold a special meeting Tuesday
‘o appropriate the money.

Clark Thompson, SAB co-chair-
man, began the meeting by ex-
plaining the three options open
to the SAB as of Tuesday night.
They could bring the Spinners
Friday night, April 23, if they
got the cash from the E.C., or
they could bring the Nitty Gritty
Dirt Band on Thursday night, the
22nd, and hire a smaller band to
play the Friday night concert or
they could bring a combination
of small bands and a quantity of
beer Friday night. According to

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Thursday, March 25, 1976

To run amok no more

The Executive Committee has finally taken
some affirmative action in the perennial
what - to - do - about - the - children - in -
the - Student - Center problem. Effective
immediately, the Cockpit is off-limits to all
unaccompanied minors. (The rest of the
building is already off-bounds.)

No one will deny that the situation, where-
in children have been allowed to run amuk in
the Center, has been tolerated for too long.
There are the impromptu soccer games in
the hallways. There is petty thievery and
not-so-petty larceny in the library and the
dining hall. There is damage done in the game
room. There is general disruption and in-
convenience to those for whom the Center
is operated,

On top of this come reports that parents
in the town and surrounding county are up-
set with us for allowing their youngsters to
rummage through the building. We hear that
parents are distraught to learn that their
children attempt to buy beer in the Cockpit
(and sueceed on occasion). We hear that par-
ents are passing a ridiculous rumor that the
building should be renamed the Student Drug
Center, that we are corrupting the minds
of their children and selling them drugs in
the process,

We will refrain from attempting to drive
home any points about parental control,
et cetera. We will attempt to ruminate on the
I2.C.’s decision to ban minors from the Center,
an action which we wholeheartedly support.

For some time now there have been signs
in the Student Center proclaiming all but the
Cockpit to be off-limits to unescorted minors.
These notices have been ignored, although
they threaten trespassers with forcible evic-

Cadets and

There is another problem in the Cockpit
if one cares to call it a problem, It seems
that W&L students are slowly but surely
working up a temper over the extensive
patronage given the tavern by our comrades
the Parade Ground. It seems
that some W&IL. students are upset when
they walk in the Cockpit on Friday or Satur-
day night and find the premises a bit crowded
with the men in gray flannel.

This particular situation has been brought
up in various meetings and in various ad-
ministrators’ offices both here and at V.M.1.
All sorts of ideas are being bandied about,

from across

from hiking prices on beer sold to “outsiders”
to reserving tables exclusively for the use of
W&L students. One can not help but smirk
at the thought of the brawls that could erupt
when parts of the Cockpit were cordoned
off—it might be a return of the type of col-

A matter

Last week's little brouhaha amongst the
members of the law school over the issue
of disenfranchisement of the third-year law
class in E.C, elections deserves comment.

The tiff underscored the point to whieh
relations have decayed between the under-
wrads and the law students, a problem that
is not going to disappear, but which in all
likelihood will inerease in dimension when
the move to Lewis Hall is completed.

The diserepaney between voting regula
tions in the law school and the undergraduate
school was pointed out in last week's regular
IC, meeting. Graduating law students have
heen accustomed to voting for the E.C, repre
sentative for the rising second- and third
vear students; senior undergraduates are not
wiven the option to vote for the following

year's senior representatives. The E.C,
attempted to rectify the diserepaney by “dis
enfranchising” law seniors in the election

Debate quickly mounted among law students
after the meeting, and soon personalities and
all manner of issues irrelevant to the matter
at hand were being raised, The vote was
rescinded in a special meeting Tuesday.

The point we wish to make is one brought

tion and the serving of warrants. This week
action is being taken to start serving war-
rants on repeated offenders, evidently a
small, identifiable group of local children,
According to one represenatative of the E.C.,
that body has been moving “at a snail’s pace”
to begin taking drastic measures to cut down
on the traffic through the Center, but the
warrants may do the trick. It is indeed un-
fortunate to have to enter on these minors’
records notice of these formal complaints, but
repeated verbal warnings have been of little
use,

Since the outside door to the game room
is supposed to be kept locked, local children
have used the Cockpit entrance to that room
to sneak in, Now problems in the game room
should be cut to a minimum, But even more
importantly, the new Cockpit rule should
remove the threat of reprisals by irate parents
against waiters inadvertently serving beer to
minors (if indeed that situation often occurs).

Persons under the age of 18 who are not
students here will still be able to enter the
Student Center when accompanied by an
adult. But unruly children of townspeople
and also of W&L faculty members will no
longer be able to run in and buy a ham-
burger, run relay races in the corridors, or
behave in rowdy fashion in the television
lounges. We applaud the efforts of the E.C.,
even if it has taken them a long time to come
to grips with the problem, and we hope that
local citizens take the new rule in the ap-
propriate light, for in the larger perspective
we are trying to protect their children as
much as we are trying to protect our build-
ing.

the Cockpit

legiate battles that once typified taverns in
two-college towns.

Attempting to control the clientele of a
public restaurant, and that is what the Cock-
pit legally is, smacks of snobbery and elitism.
Showing disruptive minors the way to the
nearest exit is one issue, but restricting use
of the Cockpit just because several students
wander in late in the evening and cannot
find a place to sit down is another. Heaven
knows, the boys in gray have precious few
chances to unwind, Who are we to deny them
a few hours of rest and relaxation, particul-
arly if they arrive and find empty tables?
Somehow it seems this whole issue does not
necd the type of resolution that is being
contemplated. Gentleman, let's not get car-
ried away in this matter.

at.3.

of unity

outin Tuesday's meeting, Members of the law
school are isolated from undergraduates in
a number of ways: social lives revolve in
different spheres and academic concerns are
‘lifferent, to name two, But most importantly,
the functioning of the Executive Committee,
including its administration of the
System, is somehow foreign to most law
students. There appears to be an ever-widen-
ing gulf between Tucker Hall and the rest
of the campus, and with the physical removal
of the law school to its new location across
the ravine, the invisible chasm will widen,

Something needs to be done, and done
soon, to help bridge the gap. If sincere efforts
are not forthcoming, it is not inconceivable
that the members of the may
petition to form their own governing body,
and perhaps even to formulate their own
honor system. We hope matters do not he-
come that strained, We hope that both sides
will realize that this campus needs to stay
united, in rule and in spirit. We hope that
some meaningful action will be taken by the
special University committee studying the
situation,

Honor

Concern for others’ needs;
and devotion to principles

Dean Frank Gilliam was one
of the most popular figures at
Washington and Lee for five
decades. He joined the faculty as
an English teacher in 1926, nine
years after he reeived his B.A.
degree from the University. He
became dean of students in 1931,
and relinquished that post in 1962
to devote his full time to ad-
missions work, which he had also
directed for many years.

In October 1974 the board of
trustees named a freshman dormi-
tory for Dean Gilliam, noting in
a resolution that freshmen “were
customarily the principal bene-
ficiaries of (his) most direct con-
cern, his first obligation.” As dean,
he had established W&L’s ‘“fresh-
man camp” in 1928, an intensive
period of orientation before the
start of classes.

W&L awarded him the honor-
ary Doctor of Laws degree in
1969, with the observation that
‘if indeed it were possible for
the magnitude of his dedication
to and affection for Washington
and Lee to be exceeded, it could
be surpassed only by the love
and admiration of all those to
whom he will always be “the good
dean’.” He also held an honorary

Why a finance pledge?

Editor, the Ring-tum Phi:

In last Monday's election, my
name was not listed on the ballot.
1 handed in my petiiton; and
while I conducted my campaign
in good faith, not violating any
regulations, I was not listed on
the ballot because I was not
informed that a pledged state-
ment of finances was required,
As soon as I was told of this
requirement, I complied by pledg-
ing that I did not spend over the
limit.

I firmly believe this is a com
munity of honor, where a man’s
word is more valuable than legal-
istic formulae; however, my word
of honor was somehow made
worthless because it was given at
10:00 p.m. election eve rather
than at 7:00 pm. It remains a
mystery how the passage of time
can affect the quality of an honor
pledge.

I would like to thank those who
wrote in my name for E.C. senior
representative, and hope | will
have an opportunity to serve the
University and Honor System in
the future.

You ask a provocative question.
Does anyone on the E.C. have an

Concert controversy

Editor, the Ring-tum Phi:

Thank God I'm leaving in June
I cannot believe that anyone in
his right mind would pay $16,000
to present a concert by the Spin-

President Huntley said on Dean
Gilliam’s death: ‘This University
has had more than its share of
special persons in its history—
but it may be that even W&L has
never had another like Frank
Gilliam.”

Huntley said Gilliam was char-
tcterized by “complete integrity,
daily concern with the needs of
others, and strong-minded devo-
tion to high principles.”

Dean Gilliam was widely recog-
nized in the academic world for
his work as admissions director
and dean of students. Under his
influence, Washington and Lee
became the first men’s college in
the south to require applicants to
take the College Board tests, and
in 1952 he became the first repre-
sentative of any southern school
to be named to the College En-
trance Examination Board execu-
tive committee.

After his graduation from W&L
in 1917, Gilliam served as a first
lieutenant in the 119th infantry
as part of the Allied Expedition-
ary Force, and saw further service
during World War II as an Army
major. From 1920 to 1926 he was
director of education for the
American Presbyterian Congo
Mission. He learned the Buluba
dialect of Bantu in his first three
weeks in Africa, and spent the
succeeding years teaching and
translating textbooks.

He was born in Lynchburg April
22, 1895, the son of the late
James R. and Jessie Johnson
Gilliam. He was married in 1924
to the former Louise Fontaine
Johnson, who died May 27, 1973.
Dean Gilliam is survived by a
brother, James R. Gilliam Jr. of
Lexington, by two children.
Fontaine J. Gilliam of Gaffney,
S.C., and Mrs. Robert L. (Louise
Augusta Gilliam) Hopkins of
Ashland, Va., and by three grand-
children.

In 1963, Dean Gilliam recalled
how he had begun his Lalf-century
association with Washington and
Lee. He and Mrs, Gilliam had
been ordered by her physician to
leave the Congo, and accordingly
he was looking for a job in educa-
tion—“but not in any great hurry
to make a decision. One night in
November the telephone rang. It
was Dr. (Edgar F.) Shannon of
the English department. ...He
asked if I could come up and
teach freshman English for him.
... 1 caught the five o’clock train
out of Lynchburg...and taught
my first class at nine. Since then
I have had my foot in the crack
of the door, and the University
hasn’t been able to shut it.” Six
years ago in a letter to a new
W&L employee he wrote: “In 1926
I came here for a three-weeks
assignment. I’ve been here for 44
years.”

Even after his formal retire-
ment from administrative duties
in 1963, when he was elected
dean emeritus by the board of
trustees, he remained an active
advisor to W&L’s presidents, and
he had an office in Washington
Hall until his death. He knew
virtually every student by name
and remembered them immedi-
ately whenever they would return
to the campus years later—‘as
you would have guessed,” Presi-
dent Huntley recently remarked.
“It is a black and almost non-
existent day when he can't re-
member a student’s name, no
matter how seldom he sees him,”
a student vrote in 1949.

Dean Gilliam’s confidence in
W&L never wavered. In a 1971
interview he observed: “We are
so far superior to what we have
ever been before, so much

stronger in our ability to meet
our primary goals, our educa-
tional objectives, that I cannot
help but be immensely pleased
with the developments I’ve seen.’

where who can tell them how
their state is going to go in the
primary, if said primary is one
of those coming in the weeks
after the convention.

But that’s only half the job. In
the event that no one comes to
the floor with enough committed
delegates to walk away with a
first-ballot nomination, the states
have to find someone out there
who can tell them where their
votes should go on the succeed-
ing ballots.

And before the selection pro-
cess goes too far, the delegates
will probably find themselves
faced with such cosmic questions
as whether Mo Udall can fall
behind Hubert Humphrey, or
whether Scoop Jackson can fall
behind Udall, or whether Jimmy
Carter can fall behind anybody,
or whether George Wallace can
fall behind.

It sounds complicated. It sounds
tough. It sounds impossible.

But it has been done before.
And after all the shouting is
over, after everyone has his share
of everything from bumper stick-
ers to tshirts that say Mock

of the delegates on the floor 1»

Tar Heels stick Generals m1

By BILL FLESHER

Larry Turkheimer turned in
the three-goal “hat trick” while
North Carolina’s defense held
Washington and Lee’s high-scor-
ing offense in check to give the
Tar Heels a 9-6 win Saturday at
Wilson Field.

A crowd of nearly 3000 looked
on as UNC raised its record to 2-1,
while the Generals suffered their
first loss in four starts.

North Carolina coach Paul Doty
called the win “one we had to
have, especially after the Mary-
land game (the Terrapins won,
12-10 in overtime) because every-
one was watching to see if we
are for real.”

The Tar Heels proved they will
be a team to be reckoned with
this season, as they controlled the
ball and the Generals for the bet-
ter part of the contest.

North Carolina faceoff mid-
fielders Dave Yingling and Randy
Gilbert won 12 of 18 faceoffs be-
tween them. As a result, the Heels
were able to keep the pressure on
W&L goalie Charlie Brown
throughout the game.

The Generals’ sophomore net-
minder kept W&L in the game
with 20 saves, 13 of them coming
in the first half.

“Brown and (Tom) Keigler were
the best players on the field, and
that includes my team,” Doty said.
“Those two stopped us from
getting a big lead when we
thought we had a chance to go
way out in front.”

Doty also had praise for All-
American defenseman Rob Lind-
sey, who shut out UNC’s high-
scoring attackman Tom Venier.

“Lindsey did a number on him,
that’s for sure,” Doty said. Venier
paced North Carolina in the
Maryland game with four goals
and three assists.

But the UNC defense didn’t do
badly, either, even though they

played without starter John
Threshie, who injured a_ knee
against Maryland.

The Tar Heel defense held

W&L’s attack to three goals, and
stopped the Generals cold for al-

most 19 minutes between the first
and third quarters.

W&L had taken a 1-0 lead when
Rob Morgan beat UNC goalie
Chuck Weinstein in a one-on-one
situation at the 2:54 mark.

North Carolina took its first
lead nine minutes later on goals
by Turkheimer and Dan Buren.
But W&L bounced right back as
freshman Chris Kearney and
Charlie Stieff scored to give the
Generals a 3-2 lead at the quarter.

Stieff’s goal was the last thing
Generals’ fans had to cheer about
until after intermission. The Tar
Heels scored three goals within
two minutes midway through the
second quarter to take the lead
for good.

Midfielder Marty Sutton scored
the first of his two goals with
W&L a man down to tie the game
3-3. Then middies Steve Sartorio
and Paul Worstell beat Brown on
hard outside shots to put UNC
in front, 5-3.

After W&L’s Donny Carroll and
UNC’s Dan Cox traded goals early
in the third quarter, Turkheimer
got a goal that may have been the
beginning of W&L’s end.

As North Carolina defenseman
Dave Klarman started upfield on
a fast break, Brown left the case
to cover Turkheimer, who was
wide open about 20 yards in front
of the goal.

Klarman fired a pass at Turk-
heimer, who reached just high
enough to deflect the ball and
send it toward the open net pas
Brown, who must now know how
Johns Hopkins’ Kevin Mahon felt
when Brown scored in last year’s
NCAA playoff from 75 yards out.

W&L again fought back to
within one goal at 7-6. Chris Lar-
son scored on an outside shot late
in the third period, while Jack
Dudley got an extra-man goal at
6:23 of the fourth quarter.

But Yingling won the all-im-
portant faceoff after Dudley's
goal, and W&L never got the ball
for a chance at a tying goal.

Turkheimer took a Randy Gil-
bert feed in front of the cage and
beat Brown for his third goal with
4:24 left to give UNC a 86 lead.

Six swimmers gain
All-American status

A two-time national champion,
six All-Americans and an eighth
place national ranking.

That’s the record compiled by
the swimming team last weekend
during the NCAA national swim-
ming championships (Division II)
in Washington, Pa.

John Hudson became W&L’s
first national champion as he won
two events, the 500-yard and 1,-
650-yard freestyles. He also fin-
ished third in the 20-yard free-
style and anchored W&L’s 800-
yard freestyle relay team that
placed seventh.

The list of All-Americans also
includes diver Bill Cogar and free
styler Tad Van Leer, Keith Ro-
mich, Rod Seott and Chip Hoke.

Cogar made All-American with
a sixth-place finish in the one-
meter diving: Van Leer was an
All-Ameriacn in the 50-yard free-
stvle after finishing 10th, and Ro-
mich made it after a ninth-place
finish in the 200-yard freestyle.

Scott, the team captain, and
Hoke joined Hudson and Romich
on the 800-yard freestyle relay

top 12 in national competition a-
chieve All-American status.

The eighth-place finish for
Coach Bill Stearns’ team was the
highest ever in the history of
W&L, which perennially has a top-
rated team. Since W&L inaugur-
ated its swimming program in the
1920’s, the Generals have record-
ed 36 winning seasons, including
eight when they went undefeated.
Since World War Il, W&L has had
26 winning years, two break-even
seasons and just one losing year.

St. Lawrence University won the
nation Division HI team cham-
pionship with 249 points, followed
in order by Johns Hopkins (233),
Williams (170), Bowdoin (143),
Kenyon (140), Wabash (126), Al-
legheny (78), W&L (74) and Ash-
land (61).

Two minutes later, W&L lost the
ball during a clear, and Sutton
scored into an open net to wrap
up the win for North Carolina.
The Generals were plagued by
poor shooting throughout the
game. W&L was outshot 47-35 by
the Tar Heels, and on four of tack
eight man-up situations, the Gen-
crals failed to get off a shot.
The Generals face another
tough early-season opponent
Saturday in the Naval Academy.
Navy beat W&L, 14-8, in Lex-

Baseball squad still undefeated

By GARY COLLIER

Although many of the players
are the same, this year’s baseball
team is showing little resemblence
to last year’s squad Washington
and Lee’s baseball team, continu-
ing their winning ways, extended
their record to 3-0 with a 4-3 extra-
inning victory over Providence
last Thursday.

In the bottom of the 12th, Mich-
ael Clary, scoring from second
base, slid safely under the catch-
er’s tag at home with the winning
run following Maynard McCorkle’s
single to center. Clary reached
first on a wide throw to the first-
baseman from the shortstop. The
shortstop, fielding Clary’s ground-
er to his right, had to hurry his
throw in an effort to beat Clary
to first. Clary took second when
the catcher bobbled a low throw
from the Providence pitcher. After
Clary advanced to second, Provi-
dence walked Co-captain Dave
Otey, which brought McCorkle to
the plate.

Dan Westbrook went the full 12

innings for the Generals, allowing
only three hits while striking out
seven batters. The win was West-
brook’s second three-hitter of the
young season.

Going into the bottom of the
eighth inning, the game was tied
2.2, Mike Falcone then put W&L
on top 3-2 with a 355-foot homer.

The Friars came back to tie up
the game in the top of the ninth.
Following a single up the middle
and a steal, another single to cen-
ter scored the runner from sec-
ond. According to many of the
spectators, the game should have
ended in the ninth. What appear-
ed to most to be the game-winning
strike-out pitch was called a ball
by the umpire. The batter, given
the alleged second chance, then
hit the game-tying single.

In the 10th, W&L had a base-
runner but could not score.

In the 11th, the Generals once
again threatened, but what could
have been the game winning run
was thrown out at home plate.

Students air discontent with SAB plans

(Continued from page 1)
rock people have had no con-
certs or dances to satisfy them.
A poll taken earlier this year by
the SAB was answered by 32%
of the student body and showed
that a majority of those students

preferred rock music to soul.
Another argument of the rock

fans was that the Spinners would
be in Charlottesville, an hour-and-
a-half drive from Lexington, the
night after they are scheduled
to appear here.

SAB members answered that.
granted, there have been many

soul bands here this year, but only
two of them were sponsored by

  

 

Ask Traveller

the SAB. The SAB tried to find
a good rock band for the week-
end in question, but found that
most of the performers they in-
vestigated were either too ex:
pensive or already booked for the
weekend. The mention of the
Charlottesville appearance of the
Spinners was answered with the
statement that the SAB hopes to
make Springs a big event at W&L.
and not at U.Va. (An issue not
brought out at the meeting Tues-
day concerning the U.Va. con-
cert is the fact that students who
attended that performance would
be making the drive after a four-
hour grain party.)

 

Q—Hlow do you explain all the Phi Beta Kappa’s given this year when
SATs are getting progressively lower and the average student
can't even sing the Campbell’s Soup jingle without harassing a

housewife first?

A—Good question. What seems to be a paradoxical situation, (moral
and mental deficiency being abundantly rewarded), is really just
a Canadian stand-off, which is not a smelly lumberjack, but rather
a type of problem having any number of equally ridiculous

answers.

The most obvious answer for low scores/high grades is the
sliding scale, by which a test score may be altered to compensate
for the test-taker’s background, intelligence, shoe size, or lack
of hair. As you may know, half the inhabitants of ancient Pompei
were posthumously awarded 720’s on their Law Boards through
the modern miracle of the sliding scale. (The other half were
disqualified for flicking ash all over the floor of the test center.)

Of course, the sliding scale can work both ways. Lower SAT’s
do not necessarily mean that W&L is getting an inordinate num-
ber of Western State out-patients as new students. It may signify
that standardized tests are becoming more difficult to take and
to accurately grade, or that they are being given to more diverse
groups, or that some Education Testing Center idiot in New
Jersey hasn’t gotten paid and is having some fun until he does.

Another possible reason for the spate of Gold Key winners is
the shocking amount of out-and-out booking going on at W&L.

Hard work, steady application, and a canacity

for sweating

through your hair can certainly make up for a lack of native
intelligence. And that, of course, cannot be measured by stand-
ardized tests. The one thousand volumes supposedly taken each
year from McCormick Library are not being taken by dishonest
students or stealthy cadets. Those books are literally demolished
through the constant handling and scuffling by Phi Beta Kappa
hopefuls. If you don’t believe me, just take a look at that human
anatomy book behind the loose brick on the fifth level. Either
the preface is shredded or that’s a mighty strange-looking pelvis.

Q—-Isn’t it possible that professors are just grading easier?

A—It’s a pleasant thought. But the real issue is who ripped off the
section on “The Female Figure in Motion” from behind that
loose brick. The next shipment of anatomy texts won’t come in

for another month.

able complaint” in saying they

them this year.

Letters
To the Editor

(Continued from page 2)

as a preferred concert. Have they
no consideration for the opinion
of the student body? Those of
us who enjoy rock have been
denied enough this year. Since
September, we have been inun-
dated with Soul music. How about
you guys on the SAB thinking
about the majority and not about
yourselves.

Let me also add that the
Souther, Hillman, Furay concert
of a year ago should not be the
basis for deciding against rock
concerts. It was as poorly planned
a concert as one could be. Only
750 people showed up. Why? I’m
sure it had something to do with
the fact that it was held mid-
term week. If it was set for a
weekend and had it been prop-
erly advertised, many more stu-
dents would have attended.

Somewhere along the line,
there is a communicaiton gap be-
tween the student leaders and
the majority of the student body
Those who hold office at W&L
better show more responsibility.
Don't forget about the little
people who elected you!

Lack of delegates, upcoming primaries face MC 76

(Continued from Page 2)
only came a few votes away
from giving it to McGovern in ’72.

Hal Wellford, credentials chair-
man, was not so optomistic on
Monday night, saying then that
he would like to wait and see the
shape of the coming primaries be
fore making any guesses. Also, he
seems inclined to wait and see
what happens over the break.

State chairmen are being en-
couraged to do some of their
phone work then, and Wellford
speculated that if the work is not
done then, the MC may be ina
trouble, The crunch is apparently
coming in the rank-and-file, mail-
and-file, phone-and-file underbelly
of the research process.

There are good arguments right
now for just about any outlook
one cares to have on the chances
of success for the MC. On the
brighter side, 1,317 of the dele-
gates to the real thing will have
been picked by the time the deal
comes down. One of the states
that will be chosen (on April 6)
is New York, a state that set an
excellent example by their before
the-fact contact with the situa-
tion in ’'72. The mock delegation
did such a good job on the floor

the last time that Morgan is re-
ferring to the “New York model”
of research and prediction in dis-
cussing the way things should be
done this year.

For those who care to take a
pessimistic view towards the odds
on MC success, one of the main
arguments might be that 961 dele-
gates worth of primaries will take
place after the MC. These include
the Nebraska-Oregon-California
group, a major test of Western
suport and a major test of any
candidate’s ability to gain and
keep momentum. Also coming up
after the MC are Ohio and Cali-
fornia, both of which have over
a hundred delegates to choose and
a favorite son candidate to steal
some of those votes from the
genuine contenders,

The number one issue for the
pessimists right now may be the
general lack of a surge of en
thusiasm on campus toward the
MC. A recent sign-up night in
the shadow of a “1776” rehearsal
brought in several persons, but
some of the delegates still are not
filled. Chairmen may find them
selves faced in late April not only

with the job of finding out what
will happen in the real world, bui
also with the job of recruiting
warm bodies here in Lexington.

The best way to bet on the
accuracy of the MC may be to
use the formula that Morgan cited
recently. According to him, bas-
ing his estimate on the past 68
years, with 10 out of 14 correct
choices, the MC chances would be
66. Basing his estimate on the
past 20 years, 4 out of 5 correct
choices, and close to McGovern in
‘72, he came up with the 85%
figure mentioned earlier.

By BOB CHIAVIELLO

The Executive Committee re-
signed itself Monday night to the
fact that it may never hear the
end of the controversy over the
Spinners concert to which it
gave $2000 last week.

Senior Michael Stritch present-
ed a petition with 320 signatures
at Monday night’s Executive Com-
mittee meeting. The petition ask-
ed for a full disclosure on how
much of the student tax would be
used for the Spinners concert
later this month, and further re-
quested that after the amount
spent on the concert by each stu-
dent was determined, the money
should be refunded to the signers
of the petition. The petition
pledged that all who signed it
would forego attendance at the
concert.

The petition claimed that stu-

dents’ musical interests had been
denied by the SAB and that the
E.C. had refused to represent their
constituents in this matter. Bobby
Pugh, Senior E.C. representative,
claimed that as far as he was
concerned he did represent the
people who elected him.

Mynders Glover, who _ voted
against the SAB’s Spinner request,
pointed out that the SAB can-
not please everyone. “Some ac-
tivities dissatisfy and some don’t,”
he said. He went on to state
that once the E.C. makes a de-
cision the student should “abide
by that decision.”

Sandy Stradtman explained that
the petition was “just a word
game,” and that the money will
come out of the student body
reserve fund, “if there isn’t
enough support for the concert.”

George C. Scott visits campus;
films scenes for Lee documentary

By ROBERT KEEFE
Cub Reporter

A feature on Robert E. Lee’s
post-Civil War years as president
of Washington College, now Wash-
ington and Lee University, will
be broadcast next Friday, April 9,
as part of the NBC-TV Today
show's Bicentennial “salute to
Virginia.”

The Lee segment was written
and narrated by George C. Scott,

the Academy Award-winning
actor, who is also a Lee authority.
Most of the filming took place
Sunday and Monday on the W&L
campus, with brief additional
scenes shot on Main Street in Lex-
ington and at the original grave
of Stonewall Jackson in the Jack-
son Cemetery.

Host for the Today show’s two-

claimed that the “only way te
have a voice is to boycott the
concert.” Stritch was quick to
point out that the petition was
not an organized boycott, but just
a Statement of the students’ views.

The E.C. voted unanimously to
table the request for a refund of
the concert money.

In further business the E.C.
heard a request by Bill Kerr,
chairman of the Voting Regula-
tions Board, on changes in the
voting procedure for student body
elections.

Kerr enumerated a number of
voting irregularities and ways to
correct them. Kerr claimed that
the largest infraction concerned

 

the use of the list of names of
those who have already voted. He
suggested that a candidate can-
not look at the list for more than
five minutes, and that he must
move at least ten feet from the
polling place.

It was recommended that the
now-mandatory statment of fi-
nances be dropped, and that it
be replaced by the candidates
pledge that he will follow all
regulations. This pledge must be
given by 7 p.m. on Monday before
the election.

Kerr reported that George Grif-
fin won the second runoff for
Junior E.C. representative with

135 votes.

A collection of 38 miniature
prints by the late artist Arthur
Szyk, centering on the career of
George Washington, has been
given to W&L by a 1964 graduate
and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Win-
field Essex Jr. of New York City.
The collection, “George Wash

Revolutionary War scenes, pri-
marily involving Washington. The
series was commissioned by the
United States government in 1932
to commemorate the 200th an
niversary of Washington's birth
Scenes such as the battle of
Concord, Bunker Hill and Fort
Moultrie and portraits of Revolu
tionary leaders including Wash
ington, Lafayette, Pulaski and
Steuben are in the collection
Szyk, who died in 1951
famous for the intricate detail in
his works, from illuminated manu
scripts to anti-Nazi cartoons dur

REVIEW andOUTLOOK A dams ,

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
Thursday, April 1, 1976

And now a petition

Suddenly the Executive Committee room is the chic spot
in which to be seen. Two weeks ago there were fifty aspiring
statesmen at the gathering. The next afternoon three dozen
law students showed up for a special session, Last Tuesday
more than three hundred students were present to hear debate,
and to interject their own lucid or obtuse comments, on the
spring concert. And last night two dozen fellows appeared
in support of a petition,

The petition of Mr. T. Michael Stritch et al is a curious
document, and the discussion concerning said petition was
even curiouser. By Mr, Stritch’s count there are 320 signatures
on the petition. The statement charges that the interests of
the undersigned in the musical realm have been ignored, com-
promised, ridiculed and so on; the decision to bring The
Spinners to campus is a betrayal of the trust placed by the
undersigned in the members of the E.C, and the S.A.B.;
because of that “breach of contract” the appropriation of
$7500 of student funds for the concert is invalidated; and
refund of a pro rata amount should be made to each of the
undersigned, who by not stretch of the imagination plan to
attend the concert.

Well. This is indeed an interesting proposal, that if a stu-
dent dislikes the way his money is being spent, he has the
right to reclaim the amount questioned. We wonder if those
320 students were actually serious about this proposal, or
whether they saw it only as a means to vent their frustrations.

It seems to us that in the name of democracy Mr. Stritch is
suggesting a form of government known in academic circles
as anarchy. By letting each student withdraw support from
projects that gained his displeasure, it would soon become
impossible to fund any programs of respectable size, includ-

ing such things as yearbooks, on-campus films, symposia, and —

newspapers. And this is not taking the idea too far, for if
the precedent were to be set (to allow refunds on the student
activities fee) there would be no limiting its application to
the S.A.B.

Extending the idea still farther, perhaps belaboring the
point: refund that portion of a student's tuition from which
he gains no direct benefits. Since all tuition money goes into
the same bank account, a chemistry student’s money is help-
ing to support an accounting professor's salary, and so forth.
The disaster to follow a policy to prevent pooling of resources
should be evident,

We therefore hopefully conclude that the 320 students were
not serious in the specific form of the petition’s resolution ;
we assume that the petition was merely to make a ponit. What
was that point?

Obviously, to give the E.C. some vague notion of the
widespread discontent over the Spinners Decision, That point
was driven home, we thought, after last week's meeting, when
the attendance was nearly 15,000% greater than when the
.C. undertook several crucial changes in the honor system
last spring.

Then perhaps the true intent of the petition was to not
only underscore the hurt feelings but to demonstrate that a
large bloc of students oppose the concert and will boyeott
the concert, urging others to act in like fashion, .\ bos cott,
to our mind, is self-defeating. The concert may very well be
a success without the attendance of the 320, (.\nd if extra
money is lost, then there is just that much more spent now
that could conceivably be used to fund the appearance of
the rock-group-of-your-dreams.) A boycott now is an open
invitation for a counter-boyeott at the next rock concert, and
the whole concert situation would degenerate to a point where
the student body would become so fractious no concert of
repute could be scheduled.

The oft-quoted music survey of last fall was widely quoted
again on Monday night. The 60% vote in favor of rock groups
has been used as a rallying flag for the rock troops in their
battle against the soul freaks. What people forget is that
32% of the student body participated in that poll, and that
that 60% is in reality only 19.2% of the student body—if the
whole school were polled the figure might not truly reach
50%, Further, it was mentioned that the poll results were
distorted, it being claimed that, for example, one individual
filled out 30 forms in favor of rock music for concerts,

Perhaps the best suggestion of any merit to come from
these proceedings is that one ought to be able to fill out a
preference card of some sort in the fall matriculation line, We
do not agree with the proposal that monies spent on concerts
should strictly follow the proportions indicated by this poll,
but we do feel that an accurate index of student sentiment on
this issue needs to be established. We really wonder if all the
whoopin’ and hollerin’ is justified—there are many more con-
cerns which need attention than the type of band to be pro-
cured for one night out of the 230 or so nights we spend in

Lexington each year.

Jefferson and Richard

Henry Lee cavorted in Evans

By STEVE BAKER

Who'd have thought a musical
could be done so well at Wash-
ington and Lee? The prize-win-
ning musical “1776,” directed by
Dr. Al Gordon and produced by
the fine arts department last week-
end in Evans Dining Hall, offered
an entertaining evening of sonor-
ous voices and witty dialogue
amidst the signing of the Declara-
tion of Independence.

The Philadelphia setting re-
quired Evans Hall to be trans-
formed into the chamber of the
Second Continental Congress.
There Congressman John Adams
led the liberals in what seemed
a hopeless cause to declare free-
dom in the face of George III and
his British troops. Frequent posts
from General Washington at
battle in New York turned the
necessity of the freedom theme
constantly upon the players. But
the story is a familiar one, or if
not, it will be by the time the
Bicentennial rolls around.

The musical “1776” focused
more on the personal struggles
and events which ultimately led
to the signing. From the numer-
ous references to the women left
behind one got the impression that
“abstinence” was the most troubl-
ing problem among the senators.
The romantic reveries of Adams
and his wife along with the vehe-
ment protests of two original
“Virginia gentlemen,” Richard
Henry Lee and Thomas Jefferson,
gave one the feeling that if they
had gotten their much-needed
saltpetre sooner, our fledgling
country would have had the will
power to secede from the entire
North American continent.

Fortunately, as the play pro-
gressed, only Thomas Jefferson
was visited by his wife, but his
cool head was then put to work
drawing an independence docu-
ment which would meet the ap-
proval of liberals and conserva-
tives alike.

The debates over this docu-
ment encompassed some of the
finer performances in the play.
The most demanding role was
handled by Rob Mish, who played
the rabble-rousing Adams. His
stylish control reflected the play’s
alternating rhythms of the whim-
sical and the filibustering. His
voice was more than pleasing; it

Committee head asks
for student concern

Editor, the Ring-tum Phi:

The Minority Affairs Coordinat-
ing Committee was created to
serve a purpose. The purpose of
those persons on the committee is
to represent the other view point
~-the view point of the minority.
Time and time again viewpoints
within the student body that lie
in the minority have failed to be
recognized. As co-chairman of the
M.A.C.C, I see that it is the
responsibility of the committee to
change this.

That which needs to be changed
is clear to some, unclear to others.
Clearly there is a misrepresenta-
tion of minorities in numerous
areas throughout the W&L com-
munity. Many activities are car-
ried on here at W&L with very
little consideration being given
to the students who constitute the
minority. And because of this
many students chose to resign
themselves from participating in
the activities of Washington and
Lee because they see that their
cries go unheard,

This university should listen to
every utterance from within the
student body, in hopes that it
will improve the school com-
munity. The M.A.C.C. was created
to listen and listen we shall. The
M.A.C.C, is as a legitimate com-
mittee as the S.A.B., Contact or
the Executive Committee, But we
shall never know what potentials
the M.A.C.C, hold if you, the con-
cerned student, do not utilize it.

Committee meetings are held
every second Thursday at 7:00
p.m. in the E.C, room. The next

supported his character as a man
given over to duty. Chuck Harer
as the national sage Benjamin
Franklin was even more impres-
sive as an actor, though his voice
didn’t have quite as much power.
He was perfectly cast though, as
was Lecky Stone as the arch-
conservative John Dickenson of
Pennsylvania. Stone came across
with a powerful calmness that
aroused the audience to significant
admiration while not involving
our sympathy.

Most notable among the other
congressmen were Dan Westbrook
as Tom Jefferson, Warren Mowry
as Col. McKean of Delaware, and
Mike Armstrong as Edward Rut-
ledge of South Carolina. West-
brook’s Jefferson was a rather
passive but eloquent statesmen
only ignited by Martha Jefferson
(played by Penni Chappell). As
the thick-tongued Scotch sena-
tor Mowry showed his penchant
for the extraordinary, larger-than-
life character. His role was offset
by the meek solon, James Wilson,
played by Charles Smith. Smith’s
performance gave the play an

Dearth of student
involvement misleads

E.C., S.A.B. members

Editor, the Ring-tum Phi:

I have been at W&L for four
years. Up until last week I was
as fine an example of apathy as
you could hope to find. The straw
that broke this camel’s back was
relatively minor. The E.C. allotted
money to pay for a Spinners con-
cert. Since I do not like soul
music I began to circulate a peti-
tion asking to have my money
refunded. Yet along the way I
discovered what the real point of
the petition should be. The real
issue far and away transcends
any merely subjective musical
taste differences. I suddenly
realized that the S.A.B. and the
E.C. took no notice whatsoever of
my interests. The people I voted
for (one of whom was certainly
a mistake) did not care or even

Soul of another kind
foregone by students

To W&L via Ring-tum Phi:
Dear Dubyanel,

Did you see Delores Jones last
Monday night? I did, along with
several (as in a few) W&L stu-
dents and quite a few (as in more
than just a few) townspeople.
There should have been 500 stu-
dents there, especially since so
many of us enjoy soul music,

I have used a term that should
have been rewritten. It should say
“many of us enjoy music that
touches our souls.” Delores Jones
did just that for me. Her singing
touched my soul, and touched it
deeply. Her singing is just beauti-

treat of a lifetime.

Well, if you missed it, don't

And yes, they sing soul, too. Just
the same, if soul musie is music
that touches one’s soul, then a
lot of soul music fans have missed
a most enjoyable performance.

ironic touch of realism: Wilson
could only muster one decision in
the three months of action the
play covered.

The only disappointing aspect
of Dan Scott’s and John Holl-
inger’s portrayals of R. H. Lee
and Gen. Washington’s Courier
was the short amount of time
they seemed to be onstage. Per-
haps it is a credit to their talent
that they seemed to be onstage
so briefly; we could have stood
much more of each of them.
Scott’s R. H. Lee was vivacious
to the point of bursting—his de-
sire to get home to his wife was
only outdone by his fondness for
the sound of his own name.
Hollinger’s performance as the
Courier interrupted the gay mood
of the play to revive the serious-
ness of events, which had been
buried beneath an entire act of
diversions and senatorial tang-
ents. The Courier’s naivete firmly
established the serious vein
within the audience’s minds and
gave the play a new degree of
substance.

“The Lees of Old Virginia”

sung by Dan Scott and John
Hollinger’s melodious ‘Momma
Look Sharp” were the best songs
in the play. They are at opposite
ends of the emotional spectrum
and bounced off each other with
a kind of emotional syncopation,

The orchestral efforts of Dr.
Gordon Spice should be lauded.
Ta assemble a viable group from
the mixed bag of musicians on
campus and in town is no small
undertaking, but the resultant
“orchestra” adquately handled
most of the score.

But most important for a play
like “1776” was the good time
had by all. It was an adventurous
enterprise as well as a success
and I look forward to the next
adventure, this time in the Lex-
ington Lime Kiln with Henrik
Ibsen’s Peer Gynt.

want to know what I| think. This
is, however, quite reasonable in
view of the fact that I had never
shown that I cared about their
activities (I hadn’t).

The real reason I presented that
petition to the E.C. involved how
well my interests and those of
people like me were represented
on that committee. I never ex-
pected to get any money back
from those guys. They don’t op-
erate that way. The point of my
petition was entirely different;
the request for a refund was
merely a means. How well do the
members of those two committees
represent you and I? How re-
sponsive are they to your voice
and mine? Unless you personally
know the members and talk to
them your answers are likely to
be negative. But how often do
you and I try to make our voices
heard? How often do we show an
interest by doing something? The
only way Clark Thompson and
Terry Atwood (villians of the
week) and your E.C. representa-
tives can know and respond to
what you want is if you and I
get off our asses and tell them.
You have to show up at meetings
and speak . . . loudly. After four
years here I learned that I made
a bad mistake. I sat back and
complained, but I did absolutely
nothing in a constructive way.
And right now when I would
like to hear my favorite music,
which is neither the Spinners or
the Dirt Band, I'm left out in
the cold. And who do I have to
blame? It’s easy to say Thomp-
son and Atwood, but that’s bull.
I've got only me to blame.

This letter has a two-fold pur-
pose. The E.C, had best pay at-
tention to the students, not just
to their friends and fraternity
brothers. The S.A.B. had best find
out what people want. Those posi-
tions are not there so you guys
can fill in blanks on a job applica-
tion. The positions and You are
there to represent and serve the
student body. However you need
input in order to realize what the
students want. To the underclass-
men who have to stay here I say
get off your asses and yell. To
the future members of the E.C.
and the S.A.B. I say listen closely;
you are there to serve, not to rule.

But the main point is that
apathy screws you over in the
end as well as all down the line,
I know: I blew it. I got from the

nothing. Don't relax with your
dope and beer. Get up, bitch a
little. Take polls, write and cir-

culate petitions. If they screw
you let them know. This ‘support
the guy we voted for’ doesn’t al-
ways work. Who all voted for
Nixon? These people can only act
if you talk to them; do it. They
can only work if you give them
something to work with; do it.
Only through encouragement and
complaint can anything be done.
Student activism need not die. It’s
the only weapon you have.

Sincerely,

T. Michael Stritch Jr. '76

Your suggestion of more stu-
dent involvement is a positive
one. If people cared, if they
bothered to attend an occasional
E.C. or S.A.B. meeting, then
some constructive ideas might
be developed. Complaining long
and loud after a decision is
made does little good; involve-
ment in the decision-making
does some good.

Local alumnus feels
“cheated, ashamed”’

Editor, the Ring-tum Phi:

I really hadn't thought of the
school year 1970-71 as that ancient
a period, but I am slowly reach-
ing that realization. There were
a lot of good concerts that year
I distinctly remember elements of
all the diverse fragments which
made up the student body en-
joying music of all kinds. It could
happen now, but I guess we'll
never have the opportunity to
find out.

Even though it’s not my money
being abused for this Spinners
gig, as an alumnus and member
of the community here, I never-
theless feel cheated, and even
more than cheated, I feel asham-
ed to have to confess to hopefully
ignorant people out there in the
real world that I am part of this
travesty of liberal arts education
where the administration has
such an easy time of things be-
cause they have students to do
their dirty work.

As a positive alternative, |
would suggest opening up the
SAB leadership and membership
to a wider cross-section of the
student body. Only then will the
worms be pushed into their proper
minority.

Sincerely,
W. Patrick Hinely, '73

Calling the current $.A.B.
members “worms” is not help-
ing in any rational discussion
of the music problem.

Ballplayers drop two;
season record slumps

By SAMMY THOMPSON

After winning the first three
games of the season, Washington
and Lee’s baseball team has lost
five out of its last six contests
dropping their record to 4-5.

Oneonta State handed the Gen-
erals their latest defeat Friday,
6-1. Left-fielder Nels Kaupilla led
W&L’s opponents with five hits in
as many trips to the plate. Kau-
pilla only needed one more hit to
have as many as all the Generals’
batters combined.

Oneonta broke up a one-run ball
game in the top of the sixth with
a bases-loaded double off W&L’s
ace pitcher Dan Westbrook. Be-
fore Westbrook could retire the
side, Oneonta came up with four
runs to increase their lead to 5-0.

The only W&L run came in the
eighth as freshman Chuck D’Aurio

led off with a walk. David Hundley
moved him to second with a bunt
and senior captain Ben Bona-
ventura singled D’Aurio home.

Thursday, the Generals suc-
cumbed miserably at the hands
of their Lexington neighbor, VMI.
The Keydets bombarded W&L
with 11 runs while, at the same
time, holding the Generals score-
less.

John Sanford went the distance
on the mound for VMI allowing
only four hits while Billy Young
led the Keydets‘ offense with two
doubles, a walk and two runs
batted in.

The Generals’ defense seemed
to have their minds on other
things—exams maybe? Anyway,
W&L committed five errors and
three different W&L pitchers gave
up a total of nine walks.

Navy victorious;
exhibition Friday

By JOHN HUGHES

Rated eighth in the country in
the latest national poll, the la-
crosse team hopes to get back
on the winning trial with a pair
of home games this week —
Wednesday against Virginia Tech
and Friday with the Australian
All-Stars.

The Generals, now 3-2 for the
year, lost a spine-tingling 8-7 de-
cision to fourth-ranked Navy last
Saturday in Annapolis after the
Midshipmen’s Mike Canders fired
in the winning goal with just 16
seconds remaining.

Coach Jack Emmer’s team twice
fought back from three-goal defi-
cits, the last time overcoming
a 7-4 Navy lead with three straight
goals, the last one Rob Morgan’s
third goal of the day with just
1:29 remaining in the game.

Soon after that, W&L was
found guilty of a holding infrac-
tion, and Navy then scored the
winning goal in an extra-man
situation.

W&L did not play well in the
early part of the game, and Navy
took a 3-0 lead, yet W&L’s strong
defense kept them within range,
and the Generals tied it, 3-3, after
two quick goals by Morgan and
Jack Dudley just before the half,
and another by Don Carroll early
in the third quarter.

Navy then spurted to three-
goal leads of 63 and 7-4, and
again W&L rallied to tie, 7-7, on
a goal by Jay Sindler and two
more by Morgan. That set the

The defense by both teams was
outstanding, particularly in the
goal. W&L’s Charlie Brown had
18 saves, while Navy’s Bill Mueller
was equally as spectacular with
16 saves.

Local lacrosse fans will have a

chance to see what promises to
be an outstanding game Friday
when the Aussies invade Wilson
Field for a 3:00 p.m. faceoff. The
Australians feature some of the
best lacrosse players in that
country, which was host to the
World Championship Games two
years ago. The United States all-
star team that won that 1974
World Tournament _ included
former W&L players Skeet Chad-
wick and Ted Bauer, and W&L
coach Jack Emmer helped coach
the squad.

To help offset the Australians’
expenses in their tour of the
U.S., and also to help pay for a
return visit of U.S. all-star players
to Australia, there will be a
nominal admission charge to Fri-
day's game.

Advance tickets, all $1.00 gen-
eral admission, will be available
at the W&L athletic office until
5:00 p.m. today. At the gate, the
tickets will be $2.00 for adults
and $1.00 for high school stu-
dents and under.

The Keydets scored three runs
in the second inning, two in the
third, two in the fourth, one in
the fifth and ended the merry-
go-round with three in the sixth.

Senior Bob Carpentier threw
the first three innings for the
Generals and was relieved by
Mike Rhoads in the fourth and
Bill Gregg in the seventh.

The Generals played Lynch-
burg College Monday and Hamp-
den-Sydney yesterday for their
final games before the spring
break.

Podgajny,
Canfield gain
top honors

Star player John Podgajny and
coach Verne Canfield of champ-
ion Washington and Lee were
voted basketball “Player-of-the-
Year” and “Coach-of-the-Year” in
the Virginia College Athletic As-
sociation’s Division III.

W&L’s Generals swept through
the eight-team Division III play
with a 13-1 record and finished
19-7 overall. Podgajny, the team
captain and a senior from Chester,
Pa., led the team in scoring with
a 17.7 scoring average.

For Canfield, it was the 10th
straight season the Generals have
posted a winning record. In that
span, his teams have won 168 and
lost 83, a percentage of .669.

Joining Podgajny on the All-
VCAA team, as voied by the as-
sociation’s coaches, are Jim Craw-
ford of Lynchburg, Dick Ponti of
Hampden-Sydney, Steve Brown of
Christopher Newport and Tom
Wright of Bridgewater.

Those five were the top scorers
in the Division, with Crawford
heading the list with a 25.5 aver-
age, Wright at 21.8, Podgajny at
17.7, Ponti at 16.0 and Brown at
15.9. Ponti led all rebounders
with a 13.8 mark, followed closely
by Wright at 13.7.

The six-man second team in-
cludes Bob Flint of W&L, Ed
Tiernan of Hampden-Sydney, Del
Battle of Virginia Wesleyan,
Wayne Davis of Lynchburg,
Davvid Hutcheon of Christopher
Newport and Dennis Gibson of
Bridgewater.

Making honorable mention were
Mike Wenke of W&L, Mike Clark
of Emory & Henry, Otis Jordan
of Virginia Wesleyan, Marty Me-
Nerney of Hampden-Sydney, Tom
Selinger of Lynchburg and Steve
Allen of Eastern Mennonite.

Springs Weekend features
four concerts -- one a day

By J. MICHAEL GALLAGHER

Has the “big Spring Weekend”
returned to W&L? That question
will be answered this weekend
by the number of people attend-
ing no less than four SAB-spon-
sored performances and one
junior grain party.

The SAB has spared no expense
in trying to satisfy the different
musical tastes that exist on
campus. The whole gala affair is
estimated to cost somewhere in
ihe area of $17,000. The bulk
of this sum is for the Spinners
concert, which opens at 8:00 p.m.
Friday with Lorie Jacobs, a

CAPITOL recording artist who
has been compared to Carol King.

After an intermission, the
Spinners will begin the first of
two 45 minute sets. There will be
a coneessions stand operated to
help kill time during the intermis-
sion. Friday’s night’s show will be
MCed by Tom Parks, a stand-up
comie who is well know in these
parts. Contrary to rumor, danc-
ing will be allowed during the
eoncert, as long as there is no
esatoring on the stage. Tickets are
$5.00 per person and may be
purchased in advance at the Stu-
dent Center, and at the door the
night of the show.

Three leading Democrats will
deliver speeches in the next week

Student works
shown in duPont

A series of exhibitions of art by
Washington and Lee students, in-
cluding four separate one-man
shows, began this week with an
all-student show, which wil con-
tinue through May 1.

That exhibition will be followed
by the one-man shows, with works
by Kurt B. Kalfs from May 3
through May 8; Peyton Via, May
10-15; Brett Burkhart, May 17-22,
and John Dean, May 24-29. All
four are senior art majors.

The final exhibition will be a
joint show of works by all the
University’s senior art majors,
Those will be on view during
graduation week, May 31 through
June 4.

The exhibitions will take place
in duPont Gallery, and the pub-
lic is invited to visit each show.
The gallery is open weekdays
from 8 to 5.

walt, who has declared his ecandi-

dacy for the U.S. Senate from
Virginia; Louisiana Senator J.
Bennett Johnston; and Thomas

Reston, Secretary of the Virginia
Democratic Party. Zumwalt will
speak tomorrow and the other
two are scheduled for Wednesday,
April 28.

The three fresentations are
centered around the issues to be
debated on the floor during the
convention’s platform session.
“We want to give the students
a pre-convention forum to discuss
the issues,” said platform com-
mittee chairman Stuart Coco.
Coco says the three men were
chosen because, “they seem ‘o
dominate the news as spokesmen
for one side on the three lead-
ing issues, Defense, Domestic
Policy and Foreign Relations.”
Coco added, “take Zumwalt for
example he is running for
the Senate on a campaign stress-
ing ‘Defense Spending.’ We hope
the students will ask him what
kind of plank he wants in the
Democratic Platform and how Vir
ginia feels about the defense
issue.”

The Zumwalt address will be
held at the Alumni House at two
in the afternoon on Friday.

three-day symposium this week-
end.

The program will bring leading
religious thinkers of the Buddhist,
Hindu, Jewish and Muslim tradi-
tions as well as Protstant and
Catholic Christians together for
a series of lectures, response ses-
sions, and special-topic seminars.

“All claims to (religious) uni-
versality (now) have to be re-
lated to the fact that no particular
religion will be the sole religion
of humankind,” according to Dr.
Donald G. Dawe, who will deliver
the opening address at the sym-
posium. Dr. Dawe is professor of
systematic theology at Union
Theological Seminary, Richmond.
Hiis remarks have been circulated
in advance to other participants
to allow them to formulate re-
sponses which will be delivered
at later points during the sym-
posium,

The program, Dr. Dawe ob-
serves in his introductory address
“ is part of the struggle to make
sense out of the Christian faith”
in light of twe seemingly con-

tradictory factors—the Biblical
direction to “go therefore and
make disciples of all nations”

(Matthew 28:19) on the one hand
and the 20th-century recognition
on the other hand that the non
Christian world “gives every evi
dence of remaining that way,”
and that the earlier aim of “the
universality of Christianity
the conversion of all people
is not to be the case.”

Platform procedures

Monday the Mock Convention
platform will be released. The
following article was prepared
by Stuart Coco, chairman of the
pleiform committee of the MC,
to explain the procedure in-
volved in drawing up the plat-
form and to present guidelines
for persons wishing to chal-
lenge the majority planks dur-
ing the convention.

The platform committee has
two purposes in its drafting of the
mock platform—to present issues
deemed important by the Demo-
cratic Party and to give due con
sideration to W&L student opin-
ion, The commitiee has researched
the issues to gain insight into the
Democratic Party's thinking on

vital issues. Balancing conserva
tive thought with moderate and
liberal ideas of the Party was

this committee's task
The W&L community will have

one more chance to inject its
wisdom into the platform. The
first came when the committee

conducted an opinion poll to a!
low the presentation of new issue
not being considered to date. The
adoption of the platform on Fri
day, May 7th, is the student's las!
opportunity te reconcile its form
with their own belief

Ethics lecture
set for Monday

“The Ethies of Behavior Modi-
fication” will be the topic of a
lecture by Dr. Harmon L. Smith
next Monday, April 6. He will
speak in duPont Auditorium at 8
p.m. Dr. Smith’s visit is spon-
sored by Society and the Profes-
sions, Washington and _ Lee’s
ethics program.

An ordained Episcopal minister,
Dr. Smith is professor of moral
theology in the Divinity School of
Duke University. He joined the
Duke faculty in 1962, after receiv-
ing his Ph.D. from that university.

In 1968-69, he studied under re-
search and study grants from the
Mary Biddle Foundation, the
“raerican Association of Theologi-
cc! Schools, and the Cooper Foun-
cation for Neurologic Research
and Education, carrying out re-
search in medicine and ethics
at the University of Edinburgh.
In 1973 he was invited to be
Humanities Research Fellow in
the Department of Neurologic
Surgery at St. Barnabas Hospital
in New York.

Dr. Smith has lectured through-
out the United States, and de-
livered a Philip Fullerton Hower-
ton lecture at W&L two years ago.
He has written several books, in-
cluding “The Christian and His
Decisions,” co-authored by Dr.
Louis W. Hodges, professor of
religion at Washington and Lee
and director of the ethics pro-
gram.

ed for pro and con speeches. The
plank is either accepted or de-
feated by a vote with no addi-
tional amendment allowed. New
planks may be presented from the
floor, after all Majority Planks
have been considered. The pro-
ponent moves to suspend the rules
to intreduce a plank from the
floor. The Chairman takes a vote

the delegates approves, the plank
is presented with the same time

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Thursday, April 22, 1976

Spring, sunshine,
and vague guilt feelings

The vernal equinox passed virtually unnoticed by students
who were preoccupied with such weighty matters as winter
exams. But our return from far-flung retreats, where we
licked our academic wounds and restored our souls, has
brought with it the realization that spring is here, as our
Rockbridge residence basks in pseudo-tropical sunshine filter-
ing through the dogwood blossoms and maple leaves. This is
really Spring Term, oft spoken of wistfully in the autumn and
expectantly, fervently in the winter, Breakneck runs down
Devil's Kitchen, sublime afternoons in the stands at Wilson
Field, mid-week evenings spent in Manson and Tinker, and
of course an oceasional foray to The Hill for a smattering ol
academic enlightenment will fill our days.

Spring Term, a time for fun, frolic, and feminine compan-
ionship. A time where studies take a (deserved?) second place
in the priority of things. Professors realize this, and con-
centrate on vanquishing the back nine, raising cherry tomatoes,
and pondering deep thoughts from the seclusion of the back
patio, Classes, well classes take a back seat, because it's
obvious the students aren't going to hit the books either,

Road trips and tubing trips and liquor runs are fine, but
we doubt that that is the total picture as envisioned by the
Board of Trustees when the calendar was revamped six years
ago. Students were expected to take full academic advantage
of the term,

This is not to imply that no one does any work in April
and May. On the contrary, certain departments offer challeng-
ing courses that exploit the opportunities available in the short
term. A number of courses are augmented with field observa-
tions: others consist of in-depth seminars made possible by
the lighter class schedules. Many departments, however, have
failed to fully appreciate the advantages o fthe Spring Term.
Rather than developing new courses or new approaches to old
courses, they rely on old courses taught with old methods in
half the normal time. All of the course material gets crammed
into six weeks, but we have the sneaking suspicion that the
impact of the subject has been lessened.

Spring Term was originally designed to be a time of de-
velopment and fulfillment for the individual student. With his
“standard” courses behind him, he was to be able to engage in
extensive research in one or two specific areas of interest to
him. For the most part this has failed to occur. In the transi-
tional year to the new schedule students found the springtime
to be great for development and fulfillment of their extra-
curricular lives, By the time new courses were added, the
notion of the Fun Term had been established. Now students
flock to courses offered in the spring that seem to offer en-
joyment and an easy work load, unless forced by requirements
to take a course in their field of concentration,

We like the term the way it now exists—it softens the
long-range effects of the devasting winter term, particularly
in vears when that term consist of twelve straight weeks of
classes with no pause. Professors like the current arrangement
too, for it gives them time for a little self-fulfillment (what-
ever that is). But deep down we feel slightly guilty, when for
forty-two days we sally forth to class so infrequently, but
have so many good times in the interim.

Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

I am an avid reader of your
weekly publication and anxiously
await every Thursday for the new
issue which I contemplate medita-
tively over a chicken breast patty
and about five small coffees. Such
ritualistic sessions with your news-
paper help dull by senses, and for
a brief hypnotic moment the rig-
orous demands of life et al are
effectively tuned out.

| was particularly tickled by the
\pril first issue, Upon reading the
headlines on page one, I made
prompt plans to pack my bags and
begin my spring vacation. My
plans were crudely aborted, how-
ever, when, reading “The Sylla-
bus.” 1 was reminded it was April
Fool's Day. I slapped my fore-
head in disbelief at my moment-
ary lack of perspicuity and pro-
ceeded to ponder the rest of the
print, amused by the catchy
phrasing of the articles, e.g. “Hol-
lins volunteers for intercourse.” I
cleared the saliva with another
cup of coffee and turned the page.

As is my custom, I focused my
attention at first on the letters to
the Editor. Mr. T. Michael Stritch’s
perturbing apologetic retrospect

down my spine in a rare moment
of self-awareness. But I was graci-
ously mollified by your editorial
and your sound responses to both
Mr. Stritch’s and Mr. Hinely’s
letters. You're right. Anarchy (as
it is defined in academic circles)
has no place in our beloved and
orderly oasis. And if we are not
fully satisfied by the way in which
our money is being used, why
should we get all boiled over? It
only sours the grapes. The best
course of action is to leave com-
plicated economics to those who
are competent and sink back
into our blind serenity. Further-
more, the S.A.B. members are
certainly not worms. They are
bonifide human beings equipped
with brains, and even if they
neglect to use them, they are
after all appointed by the E.C.
which (and your point is well
taken) is elected by the student
body.

Similar to Mr, Stritch, | am ad-
dressing myself to a far broader
issue than, say, Mr. Hinely’s
vision of what the S.A.B. mem-
bers look like. I want to thank
you, Mr. Editor, for your share
in squashing the bitching around

Notes on Robert E. Lee

This essay was written by
George C. Scott, the Academy
Award-winning actor who is also
a serious Robert E. Lee scholar.
“Notes on a Visit to Robert E.
Lee” was developed as a feature
scheduled for broadcast by
NBC-TV on the “Today” show
April 9. Most of the filming
was done on the campus of
Washington and Lee; Lee was
president of the institution
(then Washington College) from
1865 until his death in 1870.
Mr. Scott gave Washington and
Lee permission to reproduce his
remarkable script.

By GEORGE C. SCOTT

This is Main Street, Lexington,
Virginia. On Sept. 19, 1865, a big,
sandy horse with a dark mane and
tail strode effortlessly down this
street. He carried a tall, stooped
man with a pearl-white beard who

might have been taken for a
farmer—the muddy boots, the
faded, literally colorless riding
coat, the sweat-brown,  broad-
brimmed hat.

But he was not an ordinary
citizen bent on some mundane
domestic chore. Neither ordinary
—nor a citizen.

.,. On that pleasant fall morn-
ing, 11 years before America
would celebrate her Centennial
year, R. E. Lee was about to be-
come president.

Obviously, and some say un-
happily, the presidency was not
that of the United States. Rather,
it was as chief administrator of
tiny, impoverished Washington
College that Lee had come to
serve.

He was a paroled prisoner of
war under indictment for high
treason. Reviled by many as the

Dick Pinney’s songs:

not all are melancholic

By PAUL CHASTAIN

Dick Pinney can steal a show
as a warmup performer for a
more highly-billed artist—and this
is documented fact, according to
a story he relates. He tells his
audience of how, with limited
repertoire, he once played intro-
duction to a Tennessee celebrity
in Murfreesboro and unwittingly
picked one of that celebrity's
compositions as an encore when
the star was late.

“When the guy came on he
played the same song and the
audience started laughing—like,
saying ‘Why are you playing a
Dick Pinney song?’” he says, and
adds “Wish I'd known whose song
it was.”

The song is about coal mining
and the tough-and-tender life of
blue collar workers. After hear-
ing it and others in Pinney’s pres-
ent repertoire one ceases to share
the other audience's surprise that
an artist would want to commit
some Pinney to his own memory,
for Dick Pinney’s music is highly
entertaining and he has a sensi-
tivity which makes any song—
gruff, melancholy, humorous—
appealing. Just as important, his
work is technically flawless (that
is, when he is not distracted by
the ever-present noise in the Cock-
pit).

Pinney’s main thrust lies in
songs of melancholy and of people
caught in situations from which
they would love to escape, but
he does not limit himself to a
cause: probably the most sensitive
of his work, as is the case with
most musicians these days, he
gives us through self-exploration.
Although for many this path
would lead to trite exasperation,
Mr. Pinney writes poignantly of
his own purpose—“You may know
me when I have been blessed /
When I give you some and move
on/And I will leave in jubilation
And have you returning for some
more”—and of his own doubts
and self-sortings. In a particularly

 

expressive song, facetiously titled
“You Only Love Me When You're
Drunk,” he explores the pain of
and reluctant release from in-
fatuation. The impact of the song
is heightened when he cracks be-
forehand that he “bets he has
sympathizers on this one” and
elicits a few guffaws.

But Pinney is not all intro-
spection. He sings “Blues My
Sweetie Gave to Me” and other
songs about evil women, direct-
ing a few appropriate remarks at
Roanoke (he calls the town his
pinky toe on his left foot.) He
does an imitation of Merle Hag-
gard in “Door Number Three,”
which he dedicates to Monty Hall,
and his rendition of Sesame
Street's “Song of the National
Association of W-Lovers” is edify-
ing.

Pinney’s remaining perform-
ances in the Cockpit are: Thurs-
day, 5:15 and 7:00; Friday, 4:00,
5:30 and 7:00, and Saturday, 7:00,
9:00, and 10:30.

Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

This letter concerns the con-
troversy of the final decision to
bring The Spinners to W&L. As
Bobby Pugh stated, he wanted to
spend his spring weekend at W&L,
instead of going to U.Va. two
days later to see them. He failed
to understand two-thirds of the
student body (my estimate) will
not now have a spring weekend
concert anywhere, As the political
power structure now stands alone
in Red Square, the student body
of W&L will not be represented
by the present self-serving E.C.
This problem is only our fault
and our fault alone for not run-
ning for office, let this be a lesson

My two suggestions: one, that
in the future more representative
students should run for E.C., and

secondly, that the S.A.B. should
be an elected office instead of a
sub-power of the E.C,

Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:
Upon opening the 1976-77 cata
logue and checking the calendar,
we could not help but notice the
drastic manner in which the holi-
day schedule has been altered, As
students who have had to travel
great distances to attend Wash-
ington and Lee, we are particul-
arly concerned over the length
of the proposed Christmas holi-
day. With trans-atlantic and
trans-continental air fares as ex-
pensive as they are today, the
length of this holiday makes a
trip home almost infeasible. This
might well mean for most of us

Prince of Rebellion, he was tot-
ally disenfranchised — unable
either to vote or to hold any
public office.

But he was also beloved to the
point of mythology by millions
of his countrymen — and among
these were the trustees of Wash-
ington College. They borrowed
the trainfare and a suit of clothes
to send Judge J. W. Brocken-
brough to offer... the chair
of president and an annual salary
of $1,500.

Broken in health and fortune,
looking a decade older than his
58 years, Lee was apprehensive to
accept. He knew very well his
years were waning. But he wanted
desperately to be of use to what
he always termed the “rising”
generation of his country. And
when Judge Brockenbrough insist-
ed that his acceptance would
“evince a mind superior to de-
spair,” he gratefully agreed.

About the only recreation Presi-
dent Lee enjoyed during those
last few years was taking daily
rides through the sourrounding
countryside on that great grey
horse, Traveller. One of the places
he visited frequently was the hill-
side gravesite of Thomas J.
“Stonewall” Jackson.

Prior to the war, Jackson had
been a professor at nearby Vir-
ginia Military Institute. Lee
probably stood at that grave and
spoke quietly to his eccentric,
strait-laced old comrade. Jack-
son, even to this day internation-
ally recognized as one of the
profound tactical geniuses of all
time, was known to some of his
men as “School Marm.”

And Lee probably joked softly
with him that they were both
school marms now.

Undoubtedly, since they were
religious men, Lee knelt here and
prayed for both their souls. And
he probably assured “Stonewall”
that they would be united again
before very long.

But bitterness and morbidity
were foreign to Lee’s nature. And
so was looking backwards. He
worked diligently, even in rapidly
failing health, and the college
prospered—three days after his

death becoming Washington and
Lee University.

... At breakfact with his son
Robert on the morning of his
murder, Abraham Lincoln looked
at a portrait of Robert E. Lee and
said, “It is a good face. I am
glad the war is over at last.”

It was indeed a good face. Was
it not — indeed, is it not still —
the face of a good man?

Edward Valentine, who had
sculpted a likeness of Lee from
life, said: “An artist, above all
other men, is quick to observe
the faintest suggestion of posing.
The slightest indication of move-
ment or expression that smacks
of vanity, he is sure to detect.
Such weaknesses (which, as far
as I know, are shared by many
who are called great ones of
the world) were totally lacking
in General Lee.”

This is Bicentennial America.

This is Election-Year America.

This is 20th-century, thermo-
nuclear, porno-liberated, cokey-
alky, oligarchy, In-order-to-get-
I-gotta-grind-you America.

What are you and I supposed
to learn from or feel about the
world and the character of a man
like R. E. Lee?

He’s cold. We're cool.

He’s passe. We’re avant.

He’s out of it. We’re up to here
in it.

Well, there are a few qualities
this remarkable creature had
which may serve us too, if we
consider them.

Patience — quiet good humor
— adoration of children — loy-
alty — respect for had work —
dedication to an ideal — love of
animals — appreciation of duly
constituted authority coupled
with an abhorrence of authori-
tarianism — a devotion to his-
tory, for, as General Lee said,
“It is history that teaches hope”
— gentleness and the aspiration
to achieve gentlemanliness —
understanding of the state of
being young — courtesy toward
the conditional frailty of ad-
vanced age.

Acceptance of responsibility.
Personal integrity.

 

Platform: our two

will be presented right on sched-
ule and the average student on
the street can finally start to put
his two cents worth into the mas-
sive budget of the MC.

The platform that will be re-
leased is an ideologically mod-
erate affair, according to Stuart
Coco, chairman of the committee
that formulated it. It is an at-
tempt to “reconcile the Demo-
cratic view with the conservative
campus,” Coco said. The import-
ance of the platform in the larger
scheme of things depends on how
far the stuednts not on the com-
mittee want to continue the pro-
cess of reconciliation.

The committee that worked on
the platform includes: Bill Shel-
ton, Bill Kerr, Buster Briggs,
Chris Haynes, Chris Willet, James
Mallory, and Debbie Higgins. The
views represented on that com-
mittee range from Republican to
Hollins. The views that are added
depend on how many minority
planks are presented in accord.
ance with the regulations that will
hopefully be printed on the front
page of this issue.

Presenting a minority plank
does not mean going after your
ideological opponent with a two-

cents...

by-four. It has something to do
with drawing up a statement in
opposition to the majority plank,
the one in the official platform,
and turning it in to the steering
committee in time to ge an ap-
pointment to debate the issue at
the convention. The top honchos
in the MC offices are hoping that
several minority planks will be
presented since the debate and
rhetoric on the issues will be one
of the high points of the conven-
tion. According to past MC litera-
ture, the platform is the area
where student opinion gets its
expression in the convention, Un-
like the actual nomination, the
platform is designed to reflect stu-
dent thoughts on the ideas of the
day, not what the Democratic
party is expected to do.

Both the steering committee
and the Ring-tum Phi are advis-
ing any and all students to turn
in alternatives to the views put
forth in next week’s platform. The
steering committee wants them to
provide debate and excitement at
them to give the people covering
the convention somethin gto write
the convention. The paper wants
about besides how much alcohol
is consumed on the floor.

Washington and Lee’s sudden
lack of offense in the second half
against Hofstra probably cost the
Generals a chance at getting back
into the top eight in this week’s
United States Intercollegiate La-
crosse Association (USILA) poll.
After leading twice by five goals
in the first half (5-0 and 6-1),
W&L scored just one in the final
30 minutes while the Flying
Dutchmen rallied for a 10-7 win.
The Generals gained a split on
their Spring trip Saturday when
they downed C.W. Post, 13-6, de-
spite the fact that five of W&L’s
top ten midfielders did not dress
because of a curfew violation.
The Hofstra loss dropped the

24 schools in the Davidson Relays
and dropped an 85-60 dual meet
to Campbell College.

Senior Mike Burns was a double
winner against Campbell, winning
both the mile and _ three-mile.
Freshman Norvell Scott was sec-
ond in both the long jump and
440 hurdles and third in the high

POLO

The Washington and Lee Polo
Club will open an ambitious
spring home schedule on Sunday
afternoon the 25th of April at the
Blue Ridge Rider's Arena, eight
miles west of Lexington on Route
60. Game time for all home games
is 3 p.m. Admission is $1.00 for

only home game produced a loss
at the hands of the Woodlawn
Polo Club, a team Washington and
Lee had beaten twice earlier in
the year. The Washington and
Lee mallet-men helped th Uni

over the Flying Dutchmen might

have moved W&L as high 1s

seventh, since both Penn and

Brown lost over the weekend.
The week in review:

For a while last Wednesday, it
looked like the two-week layoff
hadn’t affected the Generals in the
least.

W&L jumped to a quick lead
when Donny Carroll scored with
47 seconds gone in the opening
quarter, then increased that lead
to 4-0 on goals by Rob Morgan,
Tom Keigler, and Chris Kearney.

Kearney’s second goal midway
through the second period gave
the Generals a 5-0 lead. After
Tom Rogener put Hofstra on the
board, Morgan picked up his sec-
ond goal to again give W&L a
five-goal lead.

Then the roof fell \n on the
Generals. Paul Mejia and Bill
Burton got two quick goals for
the Flying Dutchmen before half-
time to cut the W&L lead to 6-3.

It stayed that way until midway
through the third period, when
Hiofstra scored three times within
90 seconds to tie the game at 6-6.

The Flying Dutchmen took their
first lead with 2:04 left in the
quarter as Ron Taylor scored his
second goal. W&L’s Jay Sindler
tied the game again with 27 sec-
onds left, but Rich Stoecker’s
second goal just ten seconds later
put Hofstra in front for good.

Fourth quarter goals by Bob
Hiller and Stoecker were all the
Flying Dutchmen needed to put
the game out of reach of the
Generals, who managed just eight
shots on goal in the second half.

W&L goalie Charlie Brown, who
looked at 70 Hofstra shots, came
up with a season-high 27 saves.
The Generals, meanwhile, were
able to get off just 28 shots for

the entire game.

W&L bounced back three days
later to easily handle C.W. Post
even though the Generals played
without half of their top mid-
fielders.

W&L head coach Jack Emmer
suspended middies Charlie Stieff,
Jay Sindler, Brian Tray, Bob Flan-
nery, and Jim Brooks for one
game because of a curfew viola-
tion committed during the trip.

The Generals got off to a slug-
gish start, taking a 2-1 lead after
one period on goals by Morgan
and Kearney.

W&L took command in the sec-
ond quarter, with Jack Dudley,
Chris Larson, Jeff Fritz, John
Black, and Kearney scoring be-

What do football players Tom
Glassie and Scott Gardner of Vir-
ginia, Ronnie Moore of VMI, Phil
Rogers of Virginia Tech, and Jack
Berry of Washington and Lee have
in common?

They were all drafted in the
professional leagues.

Berry, the quarterback who set
all kinds of passing records at
W&L, was chosen in the 17th
round by Tampa Bay, the new ex-
pansion team in the National Foot-
ball League.

In his college career at W&L,
the Madison, Va. senior completed
369 passes for 4,299 yards and 27
touchdowns. That’s roughly two-
and-a-half miles.

Berry, who also hurls the jave-
lin, was off on a spring trip with
the W&L track team when he was

WEL favored in VCAA
tennis tournament here

By JOHN HUGHES

Host Washington and Lee is the
favorite to win the fourth annual
Virginia College Athletic Associa-
tion (VCAA) tennis tournament
here this weekend.

Defending champion Hampton
Institute elected not to compete

this year, thus giving the fa-
vorite’s role to the runner-up
Generals, whose strongest com-

petition is expected to come from
Emory & Henry and Hampden-
Sydney.

Five other teams are entered
and could surprise the favorites:
Madison, George Mason, Bridge-
water, Eastern Mennonite and
Randolph-Macon.

W&L, with an 86 record going
into a pair of matches this week,
is paced by Ben Jones at no. 1
singles, Don Caffery at no. 2 and
Jim Fisher at no. 3, and they all
made the finals last year. Johns
and Caffery have 12-2 records,

along with Ken Voelker at no. 4
and Rob Smith at no. 6, while
Fisher has an 11-3 record and no.
5 Robert Wilson is 9-5.

Their strongest competition is
expected to come from Emory &
Henry's Tom Glenn, who is 15-7
at no. 1, and Rich Rhudy, 20-4 at
no. 2, along with Hampcen-Syd-
ney’s no. 1 player, lan Valentine,
who lost to Johns at no. 3 in last
year’s VCAA championship.

The tournament will get under
way on W&L’s new asphalt courts
at 2:00 p.m. Friday. Finals are set
for Saturday afternoon, with Sun-
day a back-up dav in case of
rain.

In their most recent action, the
Generals won two of three
matches in the New Orleans area
during a spring vacation trip last
week, defeating LSU-New Orleans
7-2 and Southeastern Louisiana
6-3, and dropping a 7-2 verdict to
strong Tulane.

 

THE RING-TUM PHI Jj

 

 

Action close to the goal in one of the Generals’ two games during their spring trip. The lacrosse team

lost to Hofstra but broke even on the pair of games by defeating C.W. Post.

Jack Berry drafted by Tampa Bay

immediately for comment. Earlier
he had said he would like to
“give it a try” in the pros if
he were drafted.

“But I realize the pros take only
the top two or three quarterbacks
in the country each year, so I’m
making sure I have other plans
next year,” Berry said. A top stu-
dent, Berry’s alternate plans in-
clude teaching or law school.

Berry attracted numerous pro
scouts because of his size (6-3,
195), speed( he’s been clocked in
the 40-yard dash in 4.7 seconds)
and his ability to set up quickly
and throw deeply with something
on the ball.

Berry captained the football
team in both his junior and senior
years, and presently is a captain
on the track team. He’s a dean’s

Zumwalt, Johnston, and Reston
speak on principal platform issues

(Continued trom page 1)

The 55 year-old Zumwalt is a
native of California. He attended
the U. S. Naval Academy and
served in World War UI, where he
received four war metals. He was
commander of the U. S. Naval
Forces in Vietnam from 1968-70.
During that time he became a
leading aide for President Nixon
and Henry Kissinger.

Since his retirement Zumwalt’s
interests have turned to Virginia
politics. In his first bid for an
clected office, Zumwalt will try to
unseat Virginia senior Senator
Harry Bryd, Jr., an Independent.

Senator Johnston will speak tn
Lee Chapel at 7:30 p.m. on
Wednesday. Johnston will talk
about ‘Domestic Policies, speci-
fically the problems the country
faces in energy, urban problems
and revenue sharing.

Johnston won election to the
Senate in November of 1972 and
is reported to be one of the most
conservative Senators in Wash-
ington. If one were looking for
the young Senators likely to carry
on the tradition established by
Southern Democrats like Richard
Russell, John Stennis and John
McClellan, few could top Johns-
ton.

Johnston was named in a Time
magazine national survey as one
of the nation’s future leaders—a
selection which included only 11
other Senators. He was also
singled out to serve on the power
ful Appzopriations Committee,
and was tapped by the Senate
Democratic Caucus to chair the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee.

Johnston is the fourth-ranking
Democrat on the Interior and
Insular Affairs Committee, and
his activities in energy legisla-
tion resulted in his being named
“Outstanding Legislator in the
energy field,’ by Gas magazine,
a national publication.

A native of Shreveport, Johns-
ton is no stranger to Lexington.
He attended Washington and Lee
before transferring to the U. S.
Naval Academy. He received a
law degree from the Louisiana
School of Law.

Washington attorney Thomas
Reston will hold an open discus-
sion with student state chairmen.
The Reston gathering will be held
in the Alumni House at 9 p.m.
Wednesday. Reston has witnessed
several national conventions,
with his father, the N.Y. Times
columnist.

Reston’s convention activities
have included handling the floor

planned schedule.

Sincerely,
Pedro C. Joaristi
Enrico Dell ’Osso
No steps will be taken to alter
the calendar for next year; such
an effort was made in Novem-
ber, but the faculty declined to
act. Hopefully a more sensible
schedule for 1977-1978 will be
decided upon next autumn. The
calendar for the coming year is
a disaster, as we have mention-
ed before on this page, but un-
fortunately the faculty wants to
wait and see just how disastr-
ous.

Tax reform urged
Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

Another April 15 has come and
gone, and once more some 40
million Americans were hit with
an income tax penalty of up to
20% because they happen to be
single (including many who are
widowed, divorced, students, mili-
tary, etc.). To end this tax rip-off,
Rep. Edward Koch (D-NY) has in-
troduced HR 850 in the House
Ways and Means Committee, to
establish the tax table currently
used by married persons filling
joint returns as the tax table io
be used by ALL taxpayers. This
bill would ALSO remove tax in-
equities from married couples who
both work.

More information about HR 850
may be obtained by sending a
stamped, self-addressed No. 10
envelope to CO$T—The Commit-
tee of Single Taxpayers, 1628 21st

Another bill pending in Ways
and Means which may be of in-
terest to your readers is HR 10219,
which would allow renters an in-
come tax deduction for that por-
tion of their rent which ultimately
goes to pay real estate property
tax on their rental unit, similar to
the deduction presently allowed
to homebuyers.

All who would benefit from

The inimitable “Daddy Rabbit,” shown above
playing at the Pavilion during Saturday after-
noon’s junior class grain party, was one of the
main attractions of Springs weekend. ‘Daddy
Rabbit” was sponsored by the junior class for
the grain party and estimates of the number of
persons attending run into outrageous figures.
There is general agreement on the statement that

a lot of drunks attended.

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, APRIL 29,

E.C. tables salary dispute;
Phi, Calyx money at issue

About 250 people journeyed to Zollman’s on
Thursday to hear “Passage,” billed as a “Top-40”
band, and about the same number shook off their
hangovers to trot down to the meadow and listen
to the “Plank Road String Band” on Sunday.

In other festivities, “Daddy Rabbit’ moved on
to the Delt house Saturday night to play for a
party sponsored by the Delts, Pika, and Phi Psi.

And lest we forget, at least 2100 people attend-

ed the Spinners concert. At $5 a head, that trans-
lates to roughly $10,500.

pansion of the revenue sharing
program with the following fea-
tures:

a) Permanent appropriations

c) A requirement that 50°) of
appropriations are to be spent
on at least 5 of the areas identified
as primary city problems.

13) The establishment of social
work programs as alternatives to

conduct (i.e consenting sexual
acts, prostitution and possession
and use of marijuana).

15) The elimination of capital
punishment.

16) The leaking of intelligence

ever, will not grant unilateral
concessions to the Soviet Union.

18) The United States will con
tinue efforts to bring The People’s
Republic of China into the world
community through increased eco
nomic and cultural contacts,

19) Recognizing that a potential
crisis still exists in the Middle
East, the United States will con
tinue to strongly support the
existence of Israel and will de
nounce terrorism and all groups
perpetrating such acts.

20) The United States will con
tinue to support its commitment
to collective defense, as embodied
in NATO, and will encourage the
member nations to accept an
equitable share of the responsi
bilities and cost for this defense

As the United States embarks
upon her third century a8 a na
tion, a serious reevaluation of
her goals should be undertaken
Present policies must be viewed

the future direction of the de
velopment of American society
The national spirit that establish

1976

By MIKE GALLAGHER

The main topic of discussion at
Monday night’s E.C. meeting was
whether or not the editors and
business mangers of the Ring-
tum Phi and the Calyx should re-
ceive a salary for their duties.

A salary of $500 is split be-
tween the business manager and
editor of each organization.
Mynders Glover raised the issue,
saying he couldn’t understand
why the head of only those two
committees were paid and the
chairmen of the other committees
worked voluntarily.

The discussion around the
omiscient semicircle ranged from
Bobby Pugh’s explanation that
the heads of the RtP and Calyx
have more responsibility than the
heads of other committees since
they have to meet publication
deadlines and so on; to Leland
McCullough’s justification that
“everybody else does it,” in refer-
ence to other colleges paying their
editors.

When the discussion was open-
ed to the floor, Steve Yevich,
present editor of the Ring-tum
Phi, revealed a new salary plan
for next year. The editor and
business manager would receive
a salary of $100 each and also
receive a percentage of the profits
at the end of the fiscal year.

News editor Joe Fitzgerald
spoke out in favor of the salaries,
saying the Phi and Calyx had
“staffs” and not committees and
were run like businesses, thence
justification for the salaries.

It was also brought out that
the small salaries might be in-
centives for anyone wishing to
apply for those jobs. It was finally
decided to table discussion oa
the issue until next Monday, after
the members have had a chance

Owens; 463-9586), Ohio (Jim Falk;

Students interested in working
for these delegations should con-
tact the person indicated as soon
as possible.

Positions are also open for stu-
dents who would like to work on
the security squad during the
convention. The person to contact

Flesher, present Contact co-chair-
man. Students with questions
about how to fill out the applica-
tions should contact Flesher.
Flesher also reported to the
EC that IFC has only paid $1300
from a $3000 pledge it made to
the Contact committee at the
beginning of the year. He re-
quested EC help in collecting

this debt.
Flesher ended his report by
saying that attorney William

because of previous commitments
he has, but arrangements are be-
ing made to bring other speakers
to fill out the year’s program.

Bob Rogers, representing the
newly organized Guitar Club, ap-
proached the EC for funds to buy
songbooks for the members. When
questioned, he revealed that the
members had not been assessed
dues as yet, but wanted to see
what the EC could do for them.
Since Rogers had no clear esti-
mate as to the amount of money
the club needed, Scott Franklin
suggested they assess their mem-
bers $1.50 in dues and buy their
own songbooks. If this turned out
not to be the answer to their
problems, Rogers was told to
approach the budget committee
next fall.

Adm. Elmo Zumwalt visited the campus last Friday to speak with
Mock Convention people about some of the issues facing the
Democratic party in the President campaign. Zumwalt is the only
announced candidate for the Democratic nomination to challenge
U. S. Sen. Harry F. Byrd, Jr. (Ind.) in this year’s election. Another
speaker announced this week is Don Fowler, chairman of the
South Carolina Democratic Party. Fowler, who spoke to state
chairmen on campus last month, will deliver the opening address

to the assembled delegates next Friday.

Applications for admission to

W&L’s law school next Septem-
ber rose by 12 per cent this year
over the number a year ago,
according to statistics released
last week.

In all, 1,177 applications were
received this year, compared with
last year’s total of 1,044 accord-
ing to Roy L. Steinheimer Jr.,
dean of the law school. The 1976
figures translate into almost 11
applications for each of the 110
places in September’s entering
class.

The first-year law class next
fall will be almost half again as
large as previous first-year law
classes, which have averaged 80
students. The increase, which has
been in the planning for several
years, will be possible because
the law school moves into its new
$7-million home, Lewis Hall, over
the summer.

Steinheimer reported the en-
tering class in September will in-
clude students from 30 states who
have attended about 60 different
undergraduate colleges.

He said the overall quality of
the 1976 applicants, judged by
Law School Admission Test scores
and undergraduate grade-point
averages, “is the best we’ve ever

had.” He said Washington and
Tee’s undergraduate schools led
the list of colleges attended by
those who will enroll next fall
in the law program.

10 earlier expected, and down
even farther from an outrageous

Floats for the parade will in-

Steinheimer said the number of
vomen who applied and the num-
ber accepted were ‘about the
same” as last year, when about
one-sixth of the first-year students
were women. (The law school has
been coeducational since 1972),

Currently, the Tucker Hall has
a student population of 240, with
about 80 students in each class.
With the new law building, how-
ever, total enrollment will in-
crease to between 330 and 350.
The increase will be gradual,
with about 110 students accepted
each year until the law school
is brought up to full strength in
1978.

As the student body increases
in size the faculty will be increas-
ed proportionately as well, main-
taining W&L’s traditional 1:17
teacher-student ratio in the law
school. (The national mean, ac-
cording to the Association of
American Law Students, is be-
tween 1:23 and 1:24.)

The gradual 100-student  in-
crease in the law school will allow
W&L to expand the faculty in line
with the increasing specialization
demanded in contemporary legal
education, University officials say,
without sacrificing the  smalil-
school, personal environment
which characterizes the school.

Even with a student population
of 330 or 350, Washington and
Lee’s will remain one of the
smallest law schools in the na-
tion. In its planning at both the
undergraduate and law levels,
W&L has deliberately sought to
keep its size relatively small and
its admissions selective.

Steinheimer said Lewis Hall ahs
been “an important factor” in the
increase in number of applica-
tions this year. The new facility
will give W&L one of the best-
equipped, most technologically ad-
vanced law schools in the coun-
try, he said.

In addition to classrooms, fac-
ulty and administrative offices,
and extensive areas for student
and professional activities, Lewis
Hall will house a 250,000-volume
law library and a full-size court-
room which ultimately will be
equipped with complete television
facilities to enable students to
practice their courtroom techni-
ques and then view their own
performances on videotape to see
where improvement is necessary.

Thoughout the building, elec-
tronic connections to a media-
control center will eventually
permit instantaneous information-
retrieval.

Lewis Hall has more than six
times the area Tucker Hall, which
will be used to help meet under-
graduate classroom and faculty-
office pressures when the law
school moves.

Tucker Hall had long been in-
adequate to house the law school.
A gift of $9 million to Washington
and Lee in 1972 from Sydney and
Frances Lewis enabled construc-
tion to begin on the new law
facility. The Lewises designated
$7 million of their gift to support
construction, and $2 million to
endow a law-research center.

Counting the Lewis gift, W&L
has raised almost $12.1 million
for law school purposes so far in
its development program for the
decade of the 1970s.

Generals trounce Towson

By BILL FLESHER

Washington and Lee’s drive for
the post-season tournament began
one quarter later than expected
Saturday, but did begin in time
to keep that drive alive.

The Generals, stymied by an

inspired Towson State defense
throughout the opening period,

exploded for eight second-quarter
goals en route to a 13-9 win over
the Tigers before 3500 at Wilson
Field.

W&L, now 6-3, wiped out a 3-0
first quarter deficit by scoring
on their first four sh ts of the
second period, then took the lead
for good on three tallies within
87 seconds late in the first half.

Once in command, the Generals’
defense held the ‘Tigers’ high-
powered midfielders in cheek,
which was the key to the game,
according to both coaches.

“We defensed their isolation
moves quite well,” said W&lL
coach Jack Emmer, noting that
only three of Towson State’s goals
were scored by midfielders.

middies

“WE&L's played good
basie lacrosse,’ a disappointed
Towson State mentor Carl Runk
said. “That’s what beat us—our
middies broke down, and W&L
was able to control the game.”

Another reason the Generais
were able to dominate for much
of the afternoon was the play of
freshman faceoff specialist Jim
Babcock.

The 5’11”, 195-pound first-year
man controlled 16 of 27 faceoffs,
including seven in a row during
the Generals’ second-quarter
surge. Babcock also came up with
the day’s best shot when he
leveled Towson’s Pat Maher with
a flying check near the sidelines.

The play resulted in some heat-
ed arguing by the Towson coach-
ing staff. All it earned them was

Emmer named
coach for South

By BILL FLESHER

Washington and Lee's lacrosse
mentor Jack Emmer will coach
the South team in this year’s
North-South All-Star lacrosse
game, the Ring-tum Phi has learn-
ed.

The post-season match, which
features the nation’s top seniors,
will be played at Charlottesville’s
Scott Stadium June 5.

This will be Emmer’s first ap-
pearance as head coach in the
North-South game. While at Cort-
land State in 1972, he served as
an assistant cocch for the North
squad.

Player selection for the game
will be made sometime after the
regular season,

The weekly mystery known as
the USILA coaches’ poll again
baffled a number of people upon
its release Monday.

In case you missed it, W&L was
ranked tenth for the second
straight week, while Maryland
moved into a first-place tie with
Cornell.

There are several mind-bogglers
in this week's rankings. For ex-
ample. W&L convincingly beat
Towson State, ranked fourth in
the College Division, but did not
move ahead of number nine
Brown, a 20-10 loser to sixth
ranked Johns Hopkins.

a one minute bench penalty,
which the Generals converted into
a Jack Dudley goal that put W&L
on its way.

“We were really pleased with
the way our younger kids played.”
Emmer said, referring to Babcock
and freshmen attackmen Chris
Kearney, Jeff Fritz, and John
Black, all of whom saw extensive
action against Towson State.

Kearney led W&L with three
goals, all coming during the sec-
ond period, while Fritz, who was
starting earlier in the year, added
two goals and an assist.

“We knew Jeff could get the
job done. It was just a matter of
time before he settled down and
started playing like he can,”
Emmer said. The W&L coach al-
so praised the Generals’ blanced
scoring from the midfields. Al!
six members of the top two mid-
fielders had at least one goal,
with Charlie Stieff coming up with
a pair.

One of those middies was Don-
ny Carroll, who made the switch
from attack earlier in the week.

“It’s tough for a senior who has
been on attack for three-and-a-
half years to move to the mid-
field,’ Emmer said of the senior
tri-captain. “But Donny did what
we asked, and played a heck of
a game Saturday.”

Just about everyone wearing a
blue jersey played well, although
it took a bit more than a quarter
for W&L to get on the scoreboard.

Crease attackman Tom Nelson
scored Towson State’s first two
goals, the first in an extra-man
situation at 4:19, the second about
six minutes later when he stuffed
an attempted clearing pass by

Baseball team takes 3

Washington and Lee’s baseball
team won three of five games last
week in a grueling five-day sched-
ule. The Generals defeated VMI
and swept a doubleheader from
Bridgewater, and lost to Madison
and Hampden-Sydney. The Gen-
erals lost to Lynchburg on Mon-
day, 7-0.

Last Tuesday, the Generals beat
visiting VMI 12-7. The Keydets
had beaten W&L, 11-0, earlier in
the year. Senior captain Dave
Otey hit a two-out, bases-loaded
triple in the first inning to key
the scoring. Pitcher Dan West-
brook did not allow a run until
the seventh inning.

Hlampden-Sydney beat the Gen-
erals 8-3 on Wednessday. Fresh-
man Rich Wiles scored one run
and knocked in another one.

Bruce Williams allowed only
one run through five innings to
a powerful Madison club, before
he lost his control in the sixth
in a 40 loss. Mike Falcone had
two hits for W&L.

Washington and Lee swept its
second doubleheader this year on
Saturday when it beat Bridge-
water 9-0 and 7-6 at home. Dan

W&L goalie Charlie Brown and
dropped the ball into the open net.
The Tigers increased their lead
to 3-0 when attackman Paul Mul-
len backed in on All-American de-
fenseman Rob Lindsey, then drib-
bled a low bouncer past Brown
from about four yeards out.

Throughout the first period
W&L got several good shots on
goal, only to see Towson State
goalie Jeff Jones turn each of
them away. Jones came up with
cight of his 17 saves during the
first quarter, two of them to stop
point blank shots by Chris Law-
son and Jack Dudley.

But the Generals’ shots began
to find the cage soon enough. Rob
Morgan took a feed from Carroll
on the crease and beat Jones with
a high shot at 2:15 of the second
peiiod to put W&L on the board.

Forty-seven seconds later Fritz
moved W&L to within a goal
with a hard bounce shot from

Dave Otey had two RBI's. Otey
also knocked in the tying runs in
the bottom of the sixth inning
of the second game with a two-run
homer. Bill Gregg was the win-
ning pitcher.

sard was named Coach-of-the-Year.
Other individual champions for
W&L were Ken Voelker at no. 4
and Rob Smith at no. 6. The Gen-
erals swept the doubles competi-
tion, with Johns and Voelker win-
ning at no. 1, Ben Caffery and
Smith at no. 2, and Jim Fisher
and Robert Wilson at no. 3.

The Generals saw their season
record drop to 9-7 when they
dropped two of their three match-
es during the past week.

That enigma, the USILA coaches’ poll, again spurns the Generals

(Continued trom page 3)

Meanwhile Virginia held on to
sixth place even they had to go
to overtime to beat Towson State
(a game which has been pro-
tested by the Tigers), 16-15, while
William and Mary, not one of the
lacrosse biggies, stayed with the
Cavaliers before falling, 15-7.

Then there’s the strange case
of Hofstra. After a slow start, the
Flying Dutchmen have beaten
W&L and Adelphi (number two
in the College Division) in their

last two outings. Yet they are
ranked eighth, right behind

Hofstra early in the season.

Possibly the most perplexing
development in this week’s poll
is the tie for the top spot. First-
place deadlocks have happened
before, but rarely when an odd
number of coaches vote in the
poll. Cornell received five first-
place votes this week, while Mary-
land was named on four ballots.
The tie occurred when one coach
who picked the Terps as the top
team went with Navy over Corne}l
for second.

It’s interesting to note that
Maryland coach Buddy Beardmore
is one of ten coaches who votes
in the University Division poll,
while Cornell’s Richie Moran must
keep his preferences to himself.

Keep in mind throughout ali
this confusion that the poll has
little impact on which eight
teams receive bids to the NCAA
tournament.

The NCAA selection committee
relies more on season records and
performances against key  op-
ponents in making its picks—at
least they have in the past.

Freshman attac ane Jeff Fritz,
who played his best game of the
year Saturday, was given the Can-
non Award for his two goals, one

assist effort against Towson State
The nine-game statistics show
the Generals’ scoring to be more
balanced this year than during
the past five seasons. Donny
Carroll leads the team with 31
total points, while three other
players—Rob Morgan, Chris Kear-
ney, and Jack Dudley—are over
the 20-point mark. Another five
players are in double figures...
Kearney has a team-high 18 goals,
while Carroll leads with 19 assists
. Tom Keigler is far and away
the ground ball leader with 109.
Mark your calendars and sched-
ules. The W&L-Virginia game has
been moved up to noon on May
15. The time change was nec-
cessitated because of commence-
ment exercises that weekend in
Charlottesville . . . Maybe it was
the unique practice methods that
had something to do with W&L’s
performance Saturday. The Gen-
erals opened the week with a
lacrosse softball game on Mon-
day—hit the ball with a bat, but
play the field with lacrosse sticks.
Then the team held a_ sunrise
practice—how does lacrosse af

Wednesday so that the players
and coaches could take in the Vir-

picked up a pair of extra-man
goals, the first on a low screamer
at 4:23, the second on a high
sidearm shot that hit the top
corner at 6:21 of the period.

The Tigers came back to tie
the game at 4-4 on Mitch Lekas’
extra-‘man goal at 8:11. But Kear-
ney and Fritz worked a_ perfect
attack play behind the goal at
10:11, Kearney scoring his third
goal to put the Generals ahead to
stay.

W&L increased their lead to 7
4 as Stieff worked an isolation
move to set up a hard bounce shot
that beat Jones, followed by Dud-
ley’s extra-man score that was
made possible by the bench pen-
alty against Towson State.

Fritz with 3:06 left put the game

A BLAST FROM THE PAST—The 1972 Mock Convention, the only

clue anyone has to what this weekend’s circus will look like phy-
sically. (The political appearance is still up in the air.) At right,
the McGovern campaign leaves the floor after the last convention
made the resounding mistake of nominating Ted Kennedy instead

of the South Dakota senator.

S.A.B. budget reviewed

The Student Activities Board
ran a deficit of about $3000 on
their four-day celebration of
Springs according to unofficial
figures released at Monday night's
Executive Committee meeting.

The board had budgeted a loss
of $6000 according to Mynders
Glover, E.C. vice-president and
treasurer. The weekend cost $17,-
900 and brought in $7,955 in gate
receipts from the Spinners con-
cert, according to the report.

Glovers said the SAB also lost
money on the Coffee House Cir-
cuit, the series of itinerant musi-
cians who play the Cockpit

The deficits were made up by
surpluses on other activities, in-
cluding the Fancy Dress Weekend,
which was budgeted to cost the
S.A.B. a net amount of $7000 and
wound up costing $3500.

Surpluses also came on the Na-
tional Lampoon Show, which cost

Gilliam award

Nominations for the Gilliam
Award are due by 7 p.m. Monday
in the E.C. room. Any student
may be nominated, and any stu-
dent or faculty member may sub-
mit a formal letter letter of nomi-
nation. The E. C. will make the se-
lection Monday and the presenta-
tion of the award will be Thurs-
day.

$1700. The comedy routine was
budgeted to cost about $2100.

The final figures are contingent
on the outcome of an SAB dispute
with the group that engineered
the sound and lights for the Spin-
ners concert. The SAB is negotiat-
ing a reduced fee for the group
because certain persons and equip-
ment contracted for were not
brought to the concert.

The first meeting of the newly-
formed Student Activities Board
was held Sunday night in the SAB
office. Co-chairmen John Berley
and Mike Armstrong made a few
introductory statements about the
aims and focus of the new board,
and outlined the responsibilities
of each of the board positions.

Discussion was held concerning
possible themes for next year’s
Fancy Dress Bali, plans for the
November homecoming and the
construction of a musie survey
that will be distributed to stu
dents during matriculation next
year. Discussion on these topics
will resume at the next meeting.

SAB meetings will be held every
Sunday night at 6:30 and are open
to anyone who wishes to attend.
The board intends to represent
as broad a cross section of the stu-
dent body as is practically pos-
sible, and will appreciate any con-
structive “feedback” and/or “in-
put” that students present.

Mock Convention arrives:
who will Wé#L nominate?

By FRITZ GOLDBERG

At press time the telephones
in the Mock Convention offices
were never on the hooks for more
than a few seconds. Campus cam-
paign managers for the multitude
of candidates were caucusing
around a rat-infested couch argu-
ing against the conventional wis-

staying with the defending na-
tional champion for the entire
game before dropping a 16-14 de-
cision at College Park.

The Generals, 6-4, never allow-
ed the Terrapins’ 6-0, to break the
game wide open, as Maryland had
done in almost all of its previous
games.

The Terps held leads of four
goals on three occasions, but each
time W&L splashed across the
water-covered Byrd Stadium turf
to pull within a goal.

The Generals were as close as
13-12 with ten minutes remaining
before Maryland's Roger Tuck and
Greg Rumpf scored within 29 sec-

dom that says an atomic peanut
farmer will be Saturday’s nomi-
nee. The offices had an air of des-
peration about them as state chair-
men and campaign co-ordinators
began realizing that the Mock Con-
vention is going to happen this
weekend and there is nothing
they can do about it except pick

 

onds to increase the Terps’ lead
to three.

W&L’s Jack Dudley pulled the
Generals within a pair of goals at
7:17 of the final quarter, then put
a shot past Maryland goalkeeper
Jake Reed 1 minute after, only to
have the ball carom off a goal
post.

In the resulting scramble for
the ball, W&L’s Donny Carroll
was slapped with a tripping pen-
alty, leading to Rumpf’s second
goal of the quarter which again
gave Maryland a three-goal lead,
16-13.

Freshman attackman Chris
Kearney seored his third goal of

town when the real Democratic
convention picks somebody else in
June,

Surprisingly enough, a lot of
the political people involved with
the Mock Convention are not
ready to make a firm prediction
right now about what the out-
come of the game will be. The
same people who were saying two
weeks ago that Pennsylvania
would be the final determinant
are now sitting around looking al-
ternatively glum and _ nervous.
Others are seeming less nervous
but no less uncertain. One person
in the credentials hierarchy in-
sists that he doesn’t know who
the nominee will be, but claims
that he will be the right choice
whoever he is. Of course this is
the same nervous source who
didn't want his name used a while
back when he predicted that the
nod would go to Truman on the
fifth ballot.

The main point of concern with
the political predictors right now
seems to be whether the inevit-
able ABC, as in Anybody-But-Car-
ter, movement will be strong
enough or organized enough to
keep the piano-faced plowboy out
of the running, and if so, who do
the ABC people have to run in-
stead. Humphrey would seem the
natural choice except that no one
is sure what he will do when faced
with the choice of being the kind-
ly elder statesman of the party—
and Senate Majority Leader on
the side—or the crass gutter poli-
tico who stole the nomination

W&L within two. But the Gen-
erals managed just two shots the
rest of the game, while the Terps
went to a slowdown to preserve
the win.

Urso led all scorers for Maryland
with four goals and two assists.
Rob Morgan led the Generals wit!

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
Thursday, May 6, 1976

Another case of double standards

Earlier in the year this column took note of an E.C, comedy
we referred to as a “parliamentary quagmire.” The editorial
Was answered in no uncertain terms by an E.C. member who
felt he and the committee had been maligned by the column,
We hope to receive an equally lucid response to this writing.
The quicksand in question this time around is constitutional,
not parliamentary, and the issue involves the spirit and the
letter of the law, and which concept the E.C.-elect is re-
quired to uphold.

In choosing the committees for next year the E.C, is con-
ducting itself for the most part as if it were already in power.
The student body constitution says committee personnel shall
be chosen by the president-elect, Tom Hunter, “subject to
the approval of the Executive Committee.” The way we read
tha clause, the appointments must be approved by the present
E.C., ie, the McCullough regime, since the new E.C. has not
yet been sworn in.

Instead the appointees are being chosen by a vote of the
E.C.—elect, a body which has no official power as yet, even
though the constitution calls for their installation “within
one week of election.” The E.C.-elect is acting as if it were
already in power in another way: by closing their meetings
when they interview applicants, a practice followed by the
present E.C. as well, in spite of a constitutional amendment
a few years back which says, “The Executive Committee shall
not go into executive session except in the case of possible
honor violations.”

In its use of power in appointing next year’s committees,

the .C.elect is acting as if it were already in office; in closing
the meetings, they claim that since the appointments are
technically the acts of Mr. Hunter alone, the meeting for
interviews is not a meeting, therefore it does not have to be
open in accordance with the constitution,

The E.C.-elect is engaging in a corrupt double-standard
in this situation, They assume enough power to choose the
people who will spend $64,000 of our money next year but
not enough that they are required to obey a direct consti-
tutional rule against closed meetings.

For the record, members of the Hunter regime who argue
for closing the interviews state that the reason for conduct-
ing the sessions in secret is so that applicants can be “more
frank.” In our office lexicon, frank means “open... candid...
sincere” (American College Dictionary) among other things.
Unless we are mistaken, these words imply honesty, a quality
that knows no degree. A man is honest or he is not—there is
no more or less involved.

We wonder whether the E.C. would not be more fair to
the persons applying for committee assignments if they
opened the meetings. By saying that the applicants cannot
be as honest in open sessions, the E.C. is implying that the
applicants are all corrupt. The E.C.-elect owes apologies to
every person interviewed in last week's closed sessions, as
well as to the 1000 students who were excluded from meetings
where the groundwork is laid for spending $40 out of every
student’s pocket next year.

—J.GF.

Of budgets, stipends and kitchens

The lame-duck committee presiding over student affairs
continues to amaze us. The outgoing E.C. once again at-
tempted to legislate a matter not in its realm of jurisdiction,
This time it was a budgetary affair that properly falls in the
lap of the E.C.-elect.

The issue at stake was the salary policy of the Publica-
tions Board, specifically, the salaries paid to editors and
business manager of campus publications. In the name of
economy Mynders Glover proposed that such stipends (for
indeed they are not salaries but bonuses given if the publica
tions operate in the black) be abolished by executive decree
Mr. Glover's main contention was that since heads of E.C.
standing committees are not given any remuneration, editors
should not be given consideration. Mr. Glover and several
other Executive Committee members continually ignored the
differentiation between bureaucratic committees and campus
media services, of which the publications are a necessary part.

A case might possibly be made for stipends for a few other
student positions, but a case for abolishment of all “salaries”
cannot logically be made. Fortunately a majority of the E.C.
members failed to follow the convoluted logic of Mr, Glover.
(Our own interests were not at stake, but those of future
editors were.) It is not as though the publications men are
being paid for the honor of the job—the constant deadline
pressures, negative reactions from students and administrators

(but little praise), contractual business dealings with the loca!
merchants, reporting directly to the Board of Trustees as
well as alumni and parents, lost sleep and grades, and the
ultimate responsibility for producing a document (single-
handedly if all subordinates leave): these are a few of the
items that differentiate the Ring-tum Phi and the Calyx from
the Contact committee and the Voting Regulations Board.
The honor of running a publication is short-lived, and the
bonus is an incentive of sorts to stick it out; otherwise the
turnover of editors would be high indeed.

Mr. Glover had a further argument, that even if some sort
of salary is justified, the fact that others don’t receive money
coupled with the fact that the funds come from the student
tax makes the current situation inequitable. What Mr, Glover
and a few others failed to realize is that the student tax does
not even cover the primary printing costs of publications,
much less attendant expenses—these items, and the “salaries,”
must be paid for from advertising revenues.

Mr. Glover, is trying to conserve energy, attempted to pull
the plug on the small electric fan in the kitchen, expecting
that the occupants would stay and swelter in the heat, After
lengthy debate, the majority of the E.C. decided that the
slight amount of electricity was worth not having a different
cook for each meal.

“Historical” synopsis
of the University

In 1749 the Augusta Academy
was established fifteen miles south
of Staunton on the road leading
from that city to New Orleans
and thence to South America.
The first equipment of the school
consisted of one building, four
tons of beans, and various minor
considerations, such as a Faculty,
class bell, and a registrar. In those
days, American history was a
popular subject, because there
wasn’t much of it and the Revo-
lution and other wars had not
come along to complicate the
course. In 1760, King George of
England paid a visit to the school
and spoke on the stamp act; this
visit was repaid in the interest
of the University by the present
head of the institution in 1921.

In 1793, Augusta Academy was
combined with Liberty Hall and
moved to Lexington. The Fancy
Dress Ball was already a flourish-
ing institution, ranking with the
Boston Tea Party and other no-
table social events. In 1802, the
academy building was getting old
and the authorities decided they
would rather have the school
about a quarter mile south. The
building was heavily insured, so
when the fire broke out it burned
rapidly; the Lexington Fire De-
partment wagon reached the scene
in 1805, but of course the flames
had already made such headway
that, fighting valiantly as they did,
they were unable to save the
structure. The ruins may be seen
to this day, standing on the very
spot where the building burned.

Two buildings were built .n
1804, but they later burned down
and are hence not standing at
the present time. In 1824, the
present main building was erected
on the spot on which it now
stands. The building has since
been propped up on each side by
wings which serve to prevent a
collapse. There are 2,456,645
burned places on the floors where
cigarette stubbs have been drop-
ped, but the house simply will
not burn.

In 1861, the Faculty declared
holiday in order that the Student
Body might take part in the
athletic games then in progress
between the North and the South.
Lexington was shelled during the
games by Northern forces, but
unfortunately neither the main
building nor V.M.I. was struck.

In 1866, the Lexington Law
School was annexed te the Col-
lege and has been regarded as
one of her most valuable liabili-
ties ever since. . . . The School
of Engineering was established
the same year, and since that
time, graduates of this department
have been connected with the con-
struction of such projects as the
Castle Hill bridge, the Lexington
Steam Roller Mill, the Rockbridge
Laundry, an dthe C.&0. station.

The Carnegie Library was form-
ally opened in 1909, and since
that time no less than three per

cent of the Student Body has
made use of the volumes therein.
In 1913, Henry Louis Smith be-
came President of the University.
Under his administration the In-
stitution has become the school
for the cream of the South, and
the Faculty has established a golf
score heretofore unheard of. Paul
M. Penick became treasurer in the
Same year; since that time there
have been but two fires, the one
in Lee’s Dormitory, which was
only partially successful, and the
Law School fire of the Spring of
1923, which was a keen disap-
pointment to the rest of the Uni-
versity on account of the heroic
work of a few Law students.

In 1919, the million-dollar
campaign was started and has now
begun to pay expenses. Consid-
erable construction work has been
done during the present year, in-
cluding a new ditch across the
front Campus for waterpipes.

From the
White Book

In a public hearing the “ac-
cused may have no more than two
advisors. These advisors may be
present at the hearing and may
ask questions of any witnesses
and the accused. The E.C. shall
have no more than two of its
own members who may ask ques-
tions of the witnesses and the
accused, and who may call any
witnesses.”

The 1975-76 Executive Commit-
tee adopted this adversary system
in hopes of achieving a more
equitable hearing than with the
former system. Under this cur-
rent procedure both the E.C. and
the accused have an equal op-
portunity to present their cases to
an unbiased jury, rather than
have the jury serve somewhat as
a prosecution.

Issue of student tax raised again

Is the current method
of dividing the student
tax an effective one?

Editor, the Ring-tum Phi:

As one of the students who
signed the petition requesting re-
fund of that portion of the stu-
dent activity fee which helped to
finance the Spinners’ concert, I've
been surprised that no one has
expressed interest in the issue
which underlies the petition. Not
only the EC, but also the editor
of the Phi and the very man who
organized the petition effort have
dismissed the petition as a rheto-
rical device. When I signed the
petition, however, | had some-
thing more in mind than merely
a theatrical gesture aimed at the
SAB.

Each semester I've been re-
quired to cough up $20 for the
activity fee, which goes to the
EC for dispersal to various campus
activities. I'm billed for the
activity fee when I pay my tuition,
which effectively means that the
treasurer's office acts as the EC's
collection agency. Now, what
have been the effects of this sweet
deal (for the EC and for the
organizations which receive a cut
of the take) upon students’ con-
trol over campus activities?

First, it has rendered pointiess
any debate about the legitimacy
of student government; for if an
agency of the administration acts
as “tax collector,” the implication

is that student government is
merely an arm of the administra-
tion.

Secondly, the current arrange-
ment eliminates student control
over campus activities, I have no
choice but to fork over $40 each
year in order to subsidize activi-
ties in which I may or may not
choose to participate. Regardless
of my feelings about, eg. the
adequacy of the Ring-tum Phi, I
know it will be supported by my
money.

Thirdly—and perhaps most im-
portantly-—the activity fee re-
moves the subsidized activities
from the pressures of real-world
financing. Our economics depart-
ment tells us that enterprizes sink
or swim on the basis of their
ability to deliver what people
want; in a sense, our dollars are
votes for or against products and
services. Not so for subsidized
campus activities. The Phi or the
SAB can do whatever they wish,
‘cause they've already gotten our
money, When you consider that
students have no control over
who runs most of the subsidized
outfits (the EC graciously screens
applicants), then it is clear that
we are doubly powerless: hence,
the Spinners debacle.

It's a curious circumstance,
given the allegedly “conservative”
bent of W&L students. We appear
to be willing to subsidize organi-
zations and publications that
wouldn't stand a chance if they
had to sell themselves to stu

dents; in fact, in conversations
with EC members concerning this
issue, I've observed that the EC
explicitly assumes that the sub-
sidized activities couldn't make it
on their own, It seems to me that
if, e.g., the Phi can’t make it on
its own merits, then it should
die.

The activity fee is, in fact, of
relatively recent origin. It used to
be that students paid a nickel for
the Phi, and they bought Calyx
at the end of the year. There was
a Contact fee. I would suggest
that arguments which see such
piecemeal financing as “imprac-
tical” are self-serving evasions
of the real issue of student con-
trol, Le., if students aren't willing
to pay for concerts, yearbooks, or
newspapers, who's to say the
students are wrong? The cus-
tomer is always right, but the
current arrangement renders the
customer irrelevant.

Thus, I saw the recent petition
as a means of getting at the
matter of subsidies, I'd very much
like to see others approach the
issue in the terms outlined above;
otherwise, we're all stuck with
activities over which we have no
control and which assume the
dimensions of self-perpetuating
bureaucracies.

Yours truly,
J. A. Skelton, '76

* . +

The current arrangement allows
student control over the campus
activities through the electoral

process. If one wants to discon-
tinue subsidies for an activity, one
votes for candidates for the E.C.
who entertain similar views.

Subsidized activities must act
within the constraints set by the
E.Cc., the faculty, or whatever;
they cannot do whatever they
want just because they have been
budgeted an amount from stu-
dent funds.

Piecemeal financing is impracti-
cal in some, though not in all.
There is a necessity for some
functions such as the newspaper
—without it, students on this non-
residential campus would have
no idea what the E.C. or the
S.A.B. were doing. The 5$.A.B.
would not be able to negotiate
contracts with the top-flight bands
everyone so dearly wants to hear,
because the limited number of
people who would attend, when a
ticket would be priced at the
true cost per student of say $10,
would make the booking too risky.

The university campus is not a
competitive marketplace, and stu-
dents are not customers; the
funded activities are services re-
quired or desired by the student
populace, and public services, like
welfare programs, are almost al-
ways subsidized.

Student likes old tie

Editor, the Ring-tum Phi:

It has come to my attention, in
this historically commemorative
year, that Washington and Lee
University is in dire need of an

appropriate old-school neck tie.
The two varieties of the school
tie now available at the local
habedasheries fail to adequately
capture and portray the grandeur
of Washington and Lee University
and, thereby, do an injustice to
the University’s reputation.

I find it somewhat ironic that
the University sanctions the pro-
duction of sheets and pillow cases
and, yet, remains incapable of de-
signing a silk tie that will allow
Washington and Lee students to
dress like Virginia gentlemen, It
is shocking to think that the ad-
ministration of the University’s

affairs have allowed the manu-
facturers of these ties to print the
silhouetted symbols of our herit-
age on a 70° dacron, four-and-
a-half-inch wide plastic style tie.
As I see it, the University has a
responsibility to re-release the old
school, one-inch wide and all-silk
W&L-designed tie which was made
available and sold in years past.
Such a gesture, while small,
would be most appreciated by
those few W&L men who are
holding out against the growing
leisure look.

Respectfully,

T. C, Greenwood

THE RING-TUM PHI J

 

Generals involved in a tight race for bids

Washington and Lee will know
ten days from now whether it will
be making a fifth consecutive ap-
pearance in the NCAA Lacrosse
Championship Tournament.

For that matter, that’s when
Cornell, Maryland, and the rest
of the Division One Schools will
learn whether their seasons are
over or if summer vacations are
delayed for a few days.

The NCAA Tournament Selec-
tion Committee will meet over the
telephone on May 16, the day af-
ter the regular season ends, to
issue tournament bids to eight
teams.

Most observers believe there are
only three spots for which any
competition exists at all. The con-
sensus is that Cornell, and Mary-
land will occupy the top two seeds,
while Navy, North Carolina, and
Johns Hopkins are involved in a
struggle for spots three, four, and
five.

No one, however, is sure which
3 teams will complete the tour-
nament field. Rather than getting
involved in a guessing game over
who those bids will go out to,
here’s a rundown on the top 10
Division One teams:

1) Cornell (10-0), No one has

stayed within five goals of the
Big Red this year, and only col-
lege division stalwart Hobart has
been in the game with Cornell af-
ter halftime (Hobart dropped a
14-8 decision). Offense is Cornell’s
forte, with All-Americans Mike
French and Eamon McEneaney on
attack among the nation’s scor-
ing leaders. Jon Levine, the third
attackman, is good for two to four
goals a game, thus forcing oppon-
ents to respect all three attack-
men.

The midfields, led by brothers
Bill and Tom Marino, are solid at
both ends of the field. There is

some question as to Cornell’s de-
fensive strength, largely because
no one team has been able to test
Cornell for an entire game. Johns
Hopkins played the Big Red even
for 25 minutes, but the Blue Jay
offense then fell apart as Cornell
went on to win 15-7.

Cornell has Princeton, Cortland
State, and Brown remaining on its
schedule. An undefeated season
might mean the top seed in the
tournament for the Big Red.

2) Maryland (6-0). Unless the
Terps’ top nine midfielders come
down with the swine flu before
the bids go out, the Terps will

WéL slighted by the media men

By PAUL SIMPSON

(EDITOR’S NOTE: The coverage
of the W&L-Maryland game had
many of the Generals’ fans out-
raged by the seeming ignorance of
their team. Paul Simpson, a senior
and former station manager of
WLUR-FM, prepared this com-
mentary on the coverage. The text
of that analysis, which appeared
on WLUR Tuesday, follows.)

No one ever said sports report-
ing had to be totally fair. The
home team’s paper and broadcast
stations can usually be relied on
to lean a little toward their team,
or at the least, give the reports
from the home team’s perspective.

But the Washington Star story
on the W&L-Maryland lacrosse
game went beyond all the bounds
of reportorial decency. The head-
line read, “Terps Weather Rain

and W-and-L” thereby equating
sort of a nagging rain and what
the Star considered a nagging la-
crosse team.

The Star article had interviews
with two members of the Mary-
land lacrosse team, All-American
midfielder Frank Urso and goalie
Jake Reed.

It’s sort of expected they would
interview, Urso ... after all, he
had an outstanding day with four
goals and two assists providing a
major chunk of the winning team’s
scoring.

But, Jake Reed? Really now. He
lets in 14 goals while making
only seven saves, and he’s inter-
viewed as though he did an out-
standing job. Not to take anything
away from Reed, but all the Star
reporter had to do was look across
the field to W-and-L goalie Charlie
Brown who had seventeen saves
while allowing sixteen goals.

Then the Star allowed that al-
though the Generals showed an
impressive offense, they had a
mediocre midfield and defense
strength.

Really? OK, let's look at the
facts once again. Granted, Mary-
land’s midfields for the most part
are better than W&L’s.

As Jack Emmer commented on
W-L-U-R last Friday, they have
the depth to run four midfields if
they so desire.

But the thing that gets me is
the comment about the defense.
All-Americans Rob Lindsey and
Tom Keigler, an underrated John
Strock and of course, Charlie
Brown have to make up one of the
best defense in the nation. And
Maryland’s attack scored four
goals the whole game. Mediocre?
I think not.

Now let’s turn to the Washing-
ton Post, just to spread the blame
around. In this case, the story was
not as blatantly critical of Wash-
ington and Lee. In fact, they
couldn’t be considering they men-
tioned the Generals exactly four
times in the whole story. If you
were just to read that story, you’d

   
  
 
  
  
   
     

think the Terps had it salted
away, even when the score was
13-12 in the fourth quarter. And
you’d never know one Washing-
ton and Lee player’s name. I guess
if you’re the Washington Post, a
four goal for four shot perfor-
mance by Rob Morgan wasn’t
worth mentioning.

I guess I could forgive all these
oversights if either of the articles
had captured the true nature of
the contest. Everyone seemed to
agree, it was a good game, that it
was close to the end, that although
it was raining and the field had
become very muddy by the end of
the game, both teams were play-
ing on the same field, under the
same conditions.

But if you really want to get
right down to a partisan W-and-L
feeling, the Generals have never
been known as a good “mud

again be found in the top four
seeds. Frank Urso and friends
have proven their skills on of-
fense, but Maryland’s seeming in-
eptitude on defense (39 f goals
allowed in their last three games)
has to be disturbing to coach
Buddy Beardmore. A good offen-
sive team that can stop the Terra-
pin midfielders from scoring
could be the team to beat Mary-

4) North Carolina (9-2). The
Tar Heels have finished their re-
gular season, losing only to Mary-
land (12-10 in overtime) and Navy
(10-4). UNC is virtually assured of
a bid, but there is question as to
how sharp they might be after a
four-week layoff. UNC is solid
everywhere except in the goal,
where three-year starter Chuck
Weinstein has seen little action
late in the year. UNC could be
among the top four seeds in its
first tournament appearance, de-
pending on what Johns Hopkins
does in its final two games.

5) Johns Hopkins (7-2). The
Blue Jays were stunned by Wash-
ington College early in the season,
then handled Princeton and Vir-
ginia easily before falling to Cor-
nell. The once-mighty Hopkins

team.” W-and-L has nearly always
been a team that relied on quick-
ness and stick handling to move
the ball and get it in the goal.

Not since Skip Lichtfuss two
years ago, has W-and-L really had
anyone who could really run over
people; although freshman Chris
Kearney could be leaving a few
strewn bodies on the field in the
next three years.

And, I think it safe to say, W-
and-L may not have been too keen
on taking on Maryland in the
mud. So if the Star and Post re-
porters had been on the ball and
thought about things a little more,
they might have come to the reali-
zation that, “Mud, rain and cold
are great equalizers in lacrosse,”

Finally, as long as we're look-
ing at journalistic inaccuracy, we
should mention the absence of the
Roanoke Times at Saturday’s
game.

The Times had made a point of
it to cover the Maryland-Virginia
game, which did end up a blowout.
But before the U.Va.-Towson State
game, a Times reporter was quot-
ed as saying the paper would not
attend the W&L-Maryland game
because, “If the Wahoos got blown
out, think what Maryand will do
to you’all.”

In fact, the Terps did not blow
the Generals out, and now all we
can hope for is better coverage as
W&L moves toward another play-
off appearance.

Will we second-guess

the real Democrats?
(Continued from page 1)
from the heir of Lester Maddox.

So if Hubert really is out of the
running, as some people think is
the case after his teary refusal to
run in the primaries, the party’s
options, and the MC’s, would have
to hinge on whether Udall can do
anything in the Western pri-
maries, whether Scoop Jackson
can do anything with the medioc-
re power base of delegates won so
far, and whether Frank Church
can do anything .

Those will be some of the con-
siderations to be made when a
thousand or so people converge
on a converted basketball court
tomorrow to find out whether the
students of a school with a
high percentage of Republicans
can act like Democrats for two
days.

ler and Jim Cahill standout. The
attack trio of Franz Wittelsberger,
Rich Hirsch, and Mike O’Neill is
imposing, but only O’Neill is play-
ing up to his potential, The Blue
Jay defense remains suspect,
while goalie Kevin Mahon has con-
tinued his streaky play. Hopkins
must play at Navy Saturday, then
face Maryland at Homewood Field
one week later. Those games will
determine if the Blue Jays will be
seeded in the top four.

6) Virginia (6-4). The Cavaliers’
record coula be 5-4 by the time
you read this, since a ruling on
Towson State's protest of a 16-15
loss is expected this week. The
Wahoos won a protest earlier in
the season, thus changing an 11-10
loss to Roanoke into a “no con-
test.” The four losses that still
stand have come at the hands of
Maryland, Navy, North Carolina,
and Johns Hopkins—none has
been closer than three goals. Em-
mett Voelkel and Kris Snider lead
the attack, while Paul Marchiano
and Rich Kroll are the top mid-
dies. Sophomore Cam MacLach-
lan has done an adequate job re-
placing Rodney Rullman in the
nets. Virginia has one game left-——
if you don’t know who it’s against,
this is obviously ahe first time
you've ever looked at the sports
page.

7) Massachusetts (7-2). This
could be the mystery team of
1976, much as W&L was the un-
known four years ago. UMass has
a pair of impressive wins to its
credit, over Cortland State and
Brown, while the losses have come
to Cornell and Hofstra. Attack-
man Jeff Spooner leads this team
which could be a sleeper, but
could also be a very overrated
club.

 

8) Brown (8-2). Like Massachu-
setts, Brown is a team not too
many people know a lot about.
What Cornell does know is that
Brown is the team standing be-
tween them and the Ivy League
championship—that game comes
on the final day of the season.
Midfielder Bob MacLeod is the
standout—he has a good chance
of making first-team All-Ameri-
can. The losses are to UMass and
Johns Hopkins (20-10). Brown’s
biggest win of the year came at
Hofstra’s expense, 16-8.

9) Washington and Lee (6-4).

There’s more about the Generals
elsewhere in this paper.

10) Hofstra (6-4). The Flying
Dutchman may have played them-
selves out of the playoff picture
Saturday when they dropped a 13-
7 decision to Rutgers. Only C. W.
Post remains on the Hofstra sche-
dule, and it would take losses by
at least three of the teams above

them to earn the Flying Dutchman
spot.

Those are the ten teams that
will get a look come tournament
time. Only eight will receive bids,
only one will be the eventual na-
tional champion.

It will be most interesting to
see what happens.

Gym vandalism revealed

By JOE FITZGERALD

New activities board

makes Homecoming plans
By BILL THOMSON

The newly-elected Student Acti-
vities Board discussed plans for
next year’s Fancy Dress Ball and
Homecoming Sunday night. Plans
for Homecoming have been com-
pleted, while the theme for Fancy
Dress is still being debated. Sug-
gestions from students are wel-
come, and meetings are open to
the student body.

The board for the upeoming
year is as follows: John Berley

and Mike Armstrong, co-chair-
men; Tim Hendry, treasurer;
Scott Franklin, secretary; Bill

Broders, entertainment chairman;
Charlie Hulfish and Bob Coletti,
film co-chairmen; Doug Jackson,
university center chairman; Bill
Thomson, publicity; Jim Fore-
man, Fancy Dress coordinator;
Jim Feinman, Steve McGehee,
Bill Tucker, Barry Godin, Bob
Chiavello and Jim Thomas, mem-
bers-at-large.

 

At center, Peer Gynt (played by Bill Hirschmann) is threatened by the Troll King (Warren Mowry), in

Davis obtained the figure from
Coach Bill McHenry, at the most
recent meeting of the University
Athletic Committee. Damages in-
cluded destruction of towel racks
folowing the Spinners concert as
well as other vandalism.

Thefts included removal of
clocks, the gym’s Virginia flag
and at least 12 basketballs.

According to Davis, McHenry
asked that some action be taken
by the E.C., possibly emphasizing
gymnasium procedures more dur-
ing the freshman Honor System
orientation and the law hchool
orientation.

The commmittee will be pre-
sented with a more complete and
detailed damage report at next
week’s meeting at 7 p.m. on Mon-
day. Any action will probably be
taken by the “new” E.C. since it is
too late for any comprehensive
attempts at correction of the
problems this year.

In other business, the E.C. ap-
proved a resolution congratulat-
ing the persons connected with
the production of the Mock Con-
vention for a job well done.

Also, the E.C. continued dis-

cussion of the SAB budget. SAB
treasurer Steve Norris reported
that more complete figures will be
provided once a dispute with the
sound and light personnel for the
Spinners concert is settled.

By DOUGLASS DEWING

Governor Jimmy Carter of
Georgia was the nominee of the
1976 Washington and Lee Mock
Democratic Convention. Selected
as his running mate was Sena-
tor Walter Mondale of Minnesota.

Carter was selected on the sec-
ond ballot. In first ballot voting,
he was 134 votes short of the
150414 needed for nomination.
Shifts by Wallace supporters, the
Stevenson block in Illinois, and a
200 vote surge from New York
put him over the top. After the
New York vote, which gave him
1628 votes, the convention nomi-
nated Governor Carter by accla-
mation.

Mondale was also nominated by
acclamation, but in lieu of a sec-
ond ballot. The first ballot saw
votes cast for non-candidates such
as President Huntley of W&L,
Traveller and other greats of
both history and the contempor-
ary scene,

Governor Carter spoke to the
convention from Grand _ Island,
Neb., where he was campaigning.
He said the expression of confi-
dence in his candidacy was a
“very gratifying experience.” He
added that he hoped to live up to
the expectations of the conven-
tion, and perhaps to exceed them
by winning on the first ballot at
the real convention.

He went on to say ‘Our politi-
cal system is the best on earth.
Richard Nixon has not hurt it,
Watergate has not hurt it, the
Vietnam and Cambodian wars
have not hurt it. We’ve been hurt
in recent years with the em-
barrassments and the apologies
and the shame that have resulted
when our people have been sep-
arated from our government.”
He said he hoped the intimacy he
has achieved with the American
people by his constant cam-
paigning can be carried over into
the White House, “if and when I
win in November.”

The convention produced both
expected and unexpected results.
Carter’s nomination had been pre-
dicted in advance by WLUR.
Their surveys showed Carter
winning on the second ballot af-
ter receiving approximately 1200
votes on the first ballot.

The surveys were almost un-
necessary in pre-determining the
outcome. The Puerto Rico cre-
dentials challenge showed where

the strength in the convention
lay, as the Carter forces won with
a 75 votes margin.

The platform debate went much
as anticipated, as the conservative
W&L delegates voted down the
realistic liberal platform prepar-
ed by the Mock Convention. Sena-
tor William Proxmire (D.-Wis.),
the keynote speaker, called the
platform “‘a compassionate call on
government.” During his speech
he spoke in favor of the liberal
principles which the delegates
were to eliminate during the
evening session which woud run
until 1:30 a.m. Senator Proxmire’s
call for social legislation, civil
rights legislation, work legisla-
tion, environmental legislation
and support of the Equal Rights
Amendment brought a_ not-too-
sympathetic reaction from the as-
sembled delegates. The W&L re-
sponse to the standard democra-
tic planks brought the exclama-

tion, “Which convention am I at?”
from the Senator.

He was followed by Representa-
tive Donald Riegle (D-Mich.) who
took off his coat, rolled up his
shirt sleeves and roared right
back at the delegates.

The speaker Saturday morning,
Senator Dale Bumpers of Arkan-
sas, received a friendlier recep-
tion as he delivered a “unity”
speech, attacking the powers-that-
be in Washington, but not men-
tioning the Republican Party by
name.

An expected ‘“Anybody-but-
Carter” move never seemed to
develop, although a number of
states, led by California, seemed
willing to throw their votes to
Governor Jerry Brown of Califor-
nia on the second ballot if Gover-
nor Carter didn’t develop suffici-
ent strength on the first ballot.
A large-state caucus Friday night

Carter nominated on second

lot edge, but not enough votes to
win the nomination. There was a
lot of discussion at that point
about the entry of candidates who
might better “unify the party,”
such as Humphrey or Brown.

But when the votes were talli-
ed, Carter led them all with
13704 votes. His nearest chal-
lenger, Morris Udall, received
only 36042 votes. The other can-
didates, Jackson, Harris, Church,
Brown and Wallace trailed even
farther behind. Humphrey, who
was not officially nominated by
the convention, received 273
votes on the first ballot many of
those went to Carter on the sec-
ond ballot, including those of his
home state Minnesota.

The selection of Senator Mon-
dale is probably not going to be
seen in a favorable light by the
Senator. In 15 tries, the W&L
Mock Convention has never got-
ten the vice-president right.

Convention parade thrills town;

floats run the gamut of ingenuity

By PAUL SIMPSON

It wasn’t exactly on a par with
the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day or
Rose Bowl New Year's Day Par-
ades, but the 1976 Mock Democra
monies Parade can claim at least
tic Convention Opening Cere-
a title as long as either of its
more famous brothers and or sis
ters (the sex of parades never
having been determined). And,
for Lexington, the Mock Con
vention parade was pretty good

It boasted over 50 floats, six
bands, and the Leannettes Baton
Twirlers from Buena Vista. It
also boasted former Virginia
Lieutenant Governor Henry Ho
well as it's Grand Marshall and
Miss Joan Grady (Miss Virginia)
as an honored guest

The floats
the order of a
into the union with
scattered throughout

were arranged in
state's entrance
the bands

Large crowds turned out along
the parade route to decide for
themselves which was the best
float. And they had quite a selec
tion to choose from

There were the impressive
floats such as the Louisiana river
boat float which stood close to
20 feet high. The North Carolina
float took up an entire flatbed
of a tractor trailer. The Colorado
float was a very impressive and
artfuly designed Coors beer can
(opened)

There were the mock floats
such as the Montana float featur
ing Miss Mock Grand Tetons
with one unidentified student as
the mock girl and two smaller un
identified students as her mock
retons. The New Jersey float fea

tured approximately 15 students
doing Godfather impressions . . .
This has been rumored to be the
topic of the New Jersey float
since 1908, but this year, the Jer-
seyites were not content to do
what everyone else did. So, in
what some might consider to be
in questionable but undeniably
funny taste, they had their own
Jimmy Hoffa in the trunk, clad in
cement overshoes. The Maine
delegation’s lobsteretttes were
definite crowd pleasers

Then there were the inbetween
floats such as Virginia’s, which
depicted the “Athens of the
South,” the eventual first place
float (Kansas’ rendition of the

Wizard of Oz), and the lowa float
of a car masterfully disguised as
a corn cob.

The other floats ranged from
excellent to weak, but overall,
the floats were the highlights of
the parade and continually amaz-
ed the crowd (or at least kept
them on their toes, as when the
Florida delegation started pelting
people with oranges).

It's hard to say how this par-
ade compared to the parades of
previous years. With four years
between each one, | would guess
even the people who haven't
missed a Mock Convention parade
in twenty years have trouble re-

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Friday, May 14, 1976

WéL gentlemen,
cavalier conduct

On Saturday morning the northbound lanes of Interstate
81 will be crowded with Lexingtonians, natives and transients
alike, headed for Tom Jefferson's home territory, At noon
will commence the annual Washington and Lee / University
of Virginia lacrosse spectacular, to be held this year in Scott
Stadium in Charlottesville, The atmosphere promises to be
that of the traditional arch-rivalry, complete with banners, cat
calls, and occasional fistfights.

Two years ago extensisve damage was done to UVa's sta-
dium during the game, Plumbing fixtures were ripped from the
washroom walls, benches were damaged in the bleachers, and
broken glass was strewn throughout the stadium and parking
lots. Most of the damage occurred on the visitor's side of the
field, W&L’s side. Because of the vandalism the University of
Virginia has threatened to drop W&L from it’s lacrosse sche-
dule. Only after much cajoling and promises of no repeat per-
formances have the Generals been allowed to remain on the
Cavaliers’ agenda.

Our point is quite simple: have a good time on Saturday,
but don’t jeopardize our chances of ever meeting the Wa-
hoos in a lacrosse match again. We understand that it may be
popular for certain social organizations on this campus to
engage in “pranks” while in Charlottesville. We would advise
against such actions where they would imperil the reputation
of W&L.

Last spring the then -tricaptains of the lacrosse Generals
submitted to this paper an open letter to W&L supporters.
Here's what they wrote:

“We depend on your positive support to be successful, We
have some fond memories of situations . .. when we were
down ... and everyone in the stands gave us a standing and
long lasting cheer.

“There are times, however, when the feedback we receive
on vour actions is a negative one. We don't think that our fans
have to stoop so low as to embarass our opponents with of-
fensive language or actions... . Some of these negative actions
only tarnish all the positive things lacrosse and student la-
crosse fans have accomplished over the last few years.”

The advice is good, and we hope that all who attend Sat-
urday’s game will heed it. Let's continue our winning ways, in
our conduct on the fiteld oan din our conduct in the stands.
our conduct on the field and in our conduct in the stands.

Best of luck to the Generals!
—S§.C.Y.

Congratulations

The cochairmen, the steering committee, the state chair-
men, and everyone else involved with the 1976 Mock Demo-
cratic Convention should be commended for the fine effort
which culminated in the two-day extravaganza held in Lexing-
ton this past weekend, The years of planning, the long hours
of research, the telephone calls placed and the letters mailed,
everything that was put into the gargantuan undertaking pro-
duced an orchestrated result of which the University and the
whole community can be proud,

There were flaws in the proceedings, to be sure, but most
of these were the result of the moderate-to-conservative. Re-
publican inclinations of the average W&L student One thing
that did bother us was the presence of those empty seats in the
larger delegations we would have hoped that more of the
student body would have spent the time in the gymnasium on
Friday and Saturday.

On Monday night the new chairmen of the steering com-
mittee for the 1980 Mock Demoeratic/Republican (pick one)
Convention were picked. Soon the planning will begin anew,
We hope that those who will be here in May of 1980 will be as
successful in organizing their convention as were those who
hopefully picked the correct nominee this year,

The Mock Convention, a stunn-
ing political interlude between
Springs weekend and the campus
showing of “Deep Throat”, is fin-
ally over. It was a phenomenon
difficult to bring into focus as a
whole; therefore, what follows is
essentially a pile of semi-legible
notes arranged with no small
amount of consternation into what
will hopefully serve as an accur-
ate, or at least readable summary
of what happened this past week-
end in Doremus.

Thursday, May 6

Scrounging the campus for
some signs of excitement, all I
find are several people with a
strange gleam in their eyes. Upon
further investigation it turns out
that most of them have been
drinking masive quantities of
beer.

Beer and Henry Howell are the
topies of talk for many of the peo-
ple I see. One person found both
at a four-delegation party at the
far end of town. Thinking he may
have gained some political in-
sights between beers, I asked him
whether the voting would go to
Carter on the second or third bal-
lot. He had no idea.

Another man I spoke to was a
Ilumphrey supporter. He didn’t
know which ballot but he was cer-
tain it had already been determin-
ed. He insisted that someone in
charge knew which ballot would
give the nomination to the noted
peanut farmer. “This thing is rig-
ged,” he said.

He told me the whole thing was
controlled by four or five people.
I had no particular evidence to
dispute what he said at the time,
but I couldn’t see where the poli-
tical predestination was wrong.
After all, if we can believe the
news magazines this week, that’s
how many people are running the
Carter bid in the real world. A
new kind of political machine is
in the works that allows you to
compute your way into the White
House.

A lot of people on the steering
committee would be sorely troub-
led if they realized how many
folks out there don’t really give a
damn about the MC. Those folks
are playing basketball tonight.
They wander by from the old gym
now and then and ponder the red,
white, and bicentennial “conven-
tion hall” with bemused smiles.

inside the convention hall
there are 1200 empty chairs with
1200 “information packets” ex-
plaining approximately what a
delegate to a Mock Democratic
Convention should do with him-
self. The rafters are festooned

with tri-colored banners (guess
what three colors) and the re-
tracted bleachers behind the po-
dium sport a row of American
flags. On the wall facing the doors
there are campaign posters for all
the major candidates except Hu-
bert Humphrey and Ellen McCor-
mack.

People keep telling me that the
man responsible for this fantasti-

&

 

talked to him for being a little too
zealous in his work. I was remind-
ed of Mr. Humphrey’s would-be
fundraiser standing on the plat-
form looking glum when HHH
dropped out of a campaign he had
never entered after Pennsylvania.
One person on the steering com-
mittee said it might have been bet-
ter to turn loose the Humphrey
supporter on the floor to add

The Mississippi Delegation goes wild during one of many “spon-

taneous” demonstrations.

cal set-up is Scott Watson and that
he deserves an enormous number
of Kudos (whatever those are).
They are duly given with an apol-
ogy that the good man’s work has
not been mentioned earlier in this
column.

An insider on the steering com-
mittee, parent company for the
four or five people controlling the
nomination, informed me that the
nod would go to Carter on the sec-
ond ballot. When I asked if that
was a decision or an educated
guess, he said, in no particular or-
der, “An educated guess
(grin) .. . a little decision . . . no-
body knows I told you this... .”

It turned out that the HHH man
I talked to earlier got bounced by
the four or five people who know
which ballot, and serupulously
deny it. He was removed from the
campaign about an hour after I

Letters To

Glover strikes back;
paper’s abuses detailed

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

After reading last week's bias-
ed editorial, “Of Budgets, Sti-
pends and Kitchens,” I felt com-
pelled to express my opinion on
an issue of a more important na-
ture—the negative attitude re-
flected by the Phi staff and many
students toward the Executive
Committee.

It is inevitable that the E. C.,
just as any other governing body,
be the subject of a certain degree
of criticism, Admittedly, we real-
ize that our actions are not with-
out flaw, and so consequently,
constructive criticism serves to
keep us on our ties. However, |
strongly feel that the Ringtum
Phi’s often one-sided, melodrama-
tie articles about the E.C. are
largely responsible for inciting
misunderstanding and discontent
for a group which takes its duties
very seriously. We do, indeed, try
to act in the best interest of the
majority of Washington and Lee
students, but, naturally, we can-
not please everyone on all issues.

Mr. Yevich, we have been criti-
cized by you and your staff for
forming too many subcommittees
to investigate matters, for taking
more than what you consider a
“reasonable” amount of time to
make a decision, and for allocat-
ing funds for purposes with which
you do not agree, Yet, I feel that
we are fulfilling our responsibil-
ity to the Student Body—often
above what is required of us—
even though you might wish to
impart your own set of procedures
and outcomes. I do believe, as
well, that much of your eriticism

of the E.C, results because of your
inability to discover more news-
worthy items, as evidenced by last
week’s 5 E. C. articles and 3 la-
crosse articles. Surely, last week's
Phi could have included better
coverage of the Meck Convention,
such as notification of and back-
ground on the speakers, final de-
velopments of the Steering Com-
mittee, or the proeedure to be fol-
lowed on the convention floor, Or
perhaps you might have chosen to
mention the fact that one of the
big events for this weekend in-
cluded the Spring Alumni Re-
unions,

In conclusion, I wish to state
that, although I may occasionally
disagree with a majority decision
of the E.C., I ean, in good faith,
abide by it because I realize the
care and seriousness of purpose
with which this decison was made
in the minds of these other gentle-
men, I urge both our critics on the
Phi staff and the Student Body, as
well, to either reaffirm their con-
fidence in the E.C. or to quit bie-
kering and elect representatives
in whom they have faith.

Respectfully,
Mynders Glover
Vice-President, Student Body

Sophomore finds fault
with Goldberg’s writing

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:
Although I have come to ex-
pect precious little from your
newspaper, I must say your May 6
issue and its lead article by Mr.
Fritz Goldberg managed to dis
gust me far more than anything
you have printed to date. Seldom
have I seen such naked bias, twist-
ed half truth, and near libelous

some color to the convention.
From the looks of Saturday’s out-
come, the plan was not carried
out.

Friday, May 7

(The following paragraph was
written sometime Friday after-
noon).

Tonight’s session will probably
go to 10:30. Originally someone
on the steering committee sug-
gested that ending the session
then would allow the delegates to
drink until 12:30 and then get
ready for the next day’s early ses-
sion at 9 a.m. Phil Hatchett sug-
gested that they try to run it to
midnight so the delegates would
only drink for half an hour in-
stead of two. Rick Wolf explained
that the plan wasn’t for people to
drink until 12:30, The fact of the
matter was, according to Wolf,
that the people were going to

drink for two hours regardless of
when the session ended.

(The following paragraphs were
printed in the Ring-tum Phi fol-
lowing the 1972 Mock Convention.
The words were written by the
"7172 editor of the paper, John
Robinson.)

“The party platform was volu-
minous .. . It seemed absurd to
try roll call votes with debate on
each plank. But the absurd reign-
ed supreme, as that was exactly
what the Convention set out to do.
The results were quite fatiguing.
A liberal platform was transform-
ed into the latest Conservative
Manifesto.

Georgia Governor Jimmy Car-
ter made a keynote address of
considerable merit. As one stu-
dent observed, ‘It’s unfortunate
that Carter gave an anti-Republi-
can speech to a student body that
is largely Republican.”

(In the paragraph above, one
might consider substituting the
name of William Proxmire where
Carter’s name appears.)

The convention begins with a
statement of traditional Democra-
tic party principles during the in-
vocation, a statement that brings
the word “radical” snarling
through the lips of one person in
the press box. Perhaps a good in-
dication of what is to come. The
expressions by students of their
Republican leanings led Mr. Prox-
mire to ask at one point if he was
at the right convention. The
speech of Don Riegle found sup-
port from the crowd more for its
fire and rhetoric than for the prin-
ciples and politics outlined, There
were scattered boos when Riegle
began denouncing the oil com-
panies, but cheers and pandemoni-
ous approval broke out when the
shirt-sleeved politico gestured
madly and told the listeners, “It’s
a ripoff, IT’S A RIPOFF, IT’S A
RIPOFFIHIN!H” A stirring oratory,
if nothing else.

But neither speech brought
quite the applause that greeted
President Robert E. R. Huntley
when he ended his opening re-
marks with Alben Barkley’s last
words from the 1956 Mock Con-
vention. By now, most people pro-
bably know the story of how the
former vice-president spoke the
words, “I would rather be a ser-
vant in the house of the Lord,
than to sit in the seats of the
mighty,” and then fell over with
a fatal heart attack.

Whether it was the quote or the
general speech is probably irrele-
vant. What mattered was the de-
monstration that followed, 2500
hands clapping for the first of

phrasing attempt to masquerade
as good reporting. | am referring,
of course, to the article entitled
“Mock Convention arrives: who
will W and L nominate?”

Before | came to Washington
and Lee, | worked as associate edi-
tor of the Mercer University stu-
dent newspaper. There I was
taught a fundamental rule of good
newspaperwork; opinions belong
on the editorial page. The front
page is for news. Though the sub-
ject of Mr. Goldberg's article was
worthy of front page treatment, its
wording was more fit for the
depths of a political tract or the
columns of First Monday.

Only once did Mr. Carter's name
appear, and that was in refenence
to an “Anybody-But-Carter” move-
ment. The rest of the article re-
ferred to him as “an atomic pea-
nut farmer.” “the piano-faced
plowboy,” and “the heir of Lester
Maddox.’ “fhe first phrase was in-
nocuous enough and might have
been aceptable had it been fol-
lowed by some form of explana-
tion or clarification, neither of
which was fortheoming. Instead,
Mr. Goldberg chose to call the
man a “piano-faced plowboy,” a
choice of words that reflects con-
tempt for the oceupation of far-
mer and those who follow it, and
constitutes an editorial comment
on the candidate's fitness to hold
the ofifee he seeks.

What most irritated me, though,
was the reference to Mr. Carter
as “the heir of Lester Maddox.”
Such a statement, in light of Mr.
Maddox's record, is not only a dis
tortion of fact, but is a near libel-
ous insinuation that reflects a
complete ignorance of Georgia
polities during the Carter Admini-
stration, Had Mr. Goldberg done

his homework, he would have
found that Mr. Carter and Mr.
Maddox were the bitterest of
enemies, and that the Carter-Mad-
dox legislative battles were some
of the most heated and vicious
fights in the state’s history. True,
Mr. Carter's administration follow-
ed that of Mr. Maddox, but to call
Mr. Carter a political heir is to
imply a common political and
philosophical base, and is rather
like calling Thomas Jefferson the
heir of John Adams, or Warren G.
Harding the heir of Woodrow Wil-
son, Would you call Mr. Jefferson
a Federalist? Would you imply
Mr. Harding's support of the Lea-
gue of Nations? Obviously not, To
do so would be to ignore the facts
of their administrations. That is
precisely what Mr, Goldberg has
done. Out of ignorance and a ten-
dency to lump all Southern polli-
ticlans under one bad heading,
Mr. Goldberg has chosen to im-
ply that Mr. Carter is a clown, an
ignorant hayseed, and an ax-han-
dle-wielding bigot.

The days of poll taxes, lynch-
ings, and white-only bathrooms
are past, Mr. Goldberg. Lester has
slunk off to his lair in Under-
ground Atlanta and is once again
peddling chicken, The racist in
Southern polities is now a bad
joke: a sick curiosity. We of the
South have buried that part of our
past and marked its grave well so
that no one will be tempted to re-
surrect its stinking corpse. Let
the dead rest, Mr. Goldberg, or at
least keep your slurs and distor-
tions on the editorial pages, where
they belong.

Sincerely yours,

The deal comes down

(Continued from Page 2)
many playings of the ‘“Washing-
ton and Lee Swing”, the most imit-
ated of all college fight songs and
arguably the best convention
music, at least in Lexington, that
anyone ever wrote.

After Lexington mayor Charles
Phillips took the podium for a
moment to remind Henry Howell
that in Lexington the utilities are
being put in their proper place,
“six feet under,” the real business
of the convention began with the
first roll call, as clerk Jeff Peck
issued his first resounding ‘“Ala-
bama.”

Few thought at the time of what
the situation would be some ten
hours later, when the die-hard
clerk would finish another roll-
call, on a gun control plank for
the platform, with his voice crack-
ing as he asked “Are there any
more changes?”

By then there were 349 people
left on the floor, not counting the
press and security people. I was
sitting in the back rows of the
near-empty floor just before the
gun control plank came up, talk-
ing to a security man in resplen-
dent red MC T-shirt who explain-
ed the procedural matters going on
in a thick Carolina drawl. “What
we've got here,” he explained, “is
a mathematical equation involv-
ing the factors of alcohol, late-
ness, and general confusion; the
three come together to create a
problem that can’t be overcome.”

The guard was doing more theo-
rizing than securing at the time.
Efforts to stop the flow of brew
had long since ceased and the con-
vention was reaching a dead end
when an exhausted Reed Morgan
stepped to the podium to explain
how to vote on yet another plank.

“An aye vote will make it part of
the platform,” he said, “And a
nay will .. .” At this point he
waved his hand and looked con-
fused. Someone on the floor call-
ed out “bag it.” “That’s right,”
Morgan said, looking very reliev-

ed, “It'll bag it.”

Saturday, May 8

I was wondering during the

“unity speech” from Sen. Bum-

pers why he should get cheers
from the floor where Sen. Prox-
mire was booed so resoundingly
the night before. One person told
me that a certain student from
Bumpers’ home state, Arkansas,
had warned all delegates that if
the senator were greeted with cat-
calls, someone was going to pay.

Someone in the press box ex-
plained it a little differently. He
explained that the Republicans
had been up late the night before
trying to get minority planks add-
ed to the platform. They had stay-
ed up so late that they were all
stil in bed, so the Democrats had
a majority to greet Bumpers.

Bumpers speech was the first
indication of how the day was to

go. It was a Southern day from
start to finish. Dorman Walker,
Alabama native and Carter’s cam-
paign co-ordinator on the floor,
walked around with a grin that
would put the Georgia governor
to shame. Harry T. Jones of Geor-
gia gave the speech seconding the
nomination of Carter. In a drawl
that would, like Walker’s grin, put
Mr. Carter to shame, he suggested
to the convention, ‘“Let’s put an-
other farmer in the White House.”
Russell Moore of Alabama had de-
livered the first speech nominat-
ing Carter.

Following Carter’s nomination
by acclamation, the sound system
boomed out the words of our na-
tional anthem, “And I wish I was
in Dixie .. .”’ and even the most
serious doubters knew that indeed
they couldn’t possibly be any-
where else.

After “Dixie’”’ and the umpteen-
th playing of the “Swing”, the de-
legates began filing out and pre-
paring their ludicrous vice-presi-
dential votes. As they left, the
sound system came alive again
with the words of a song not quite
so traditional as some of the oth-
ers, Bruce Springsteen’s slashing
rocker, “Born to Run’. Although
the playing of the song was coin-
cidental, owing to its place on the
tape, it was perhaps a significant
comment on the many politicians
considered and rejected this morn-
ing, and the one finally chosen.

When the delegates returned,
there was some doubt, but not
much, as to whom they would pick
to run with Carter. The nod would
probably go to Mondale, because,
as Dorman Walker explained it
earlier, “That’s the deal I just
made.” So there was plenty of
room for the delegates to play
around during the afternoon, giv-
ing votes for vp to everyone from
Bobby Pugh to Elvis Presley.

The afternoon’s color came not
only from the variety of the vice-
presidential votes, but also from
the required descriptions of the
states by the people reading off
the vote tallies.

California, the home of the
Beach Boys and California girls

Georgia ,the home of Coca-cola

Illinois, the home of the St.
Valentine’s day massacre and the
world’s greatest mayor...

The Virgin Islands, where celi-
bacy has been a way of life for

200 years...

Guam, the home of lizards and
B-52’s .

Kansas, the home of Vivian

Vance, John Cameron Swayze, and
not much else...

And West Virginia, nominating
their favorite son, Sen. Robert
Byrd, with the words, “We're gett-
ing the finger from Washington,
we might as well put a Byrd in
the White House.”

In the long run, the delegates
were not quite that fatalistic.
They also were not reserved, calm,
or dignified for the most part. But
none of that counts. In the long
run, let’s just hope they were
right.

Generals eye Saturday showdown

By BILL FLESHER

Washington and Lee’s lacrosse
team set the stage for this week’s
showdown against archrival Vir-
ginia with a pair of wins over
both top-rated college division
teams last week.

The Generals played a strong
second half Wednesday to pull
away from last week’s number
one squad, Roanoke College, 12-8,
then shook off a case of the post-
Mock Convention blahs to stop
Cortland State, 13-10, just hours
before the Red Dragons replaced
Roanoke at the top of the college
division poll.

W&L had a different leader in
both games—Jay Sindler pumped
in three goals against Roanoke,
while freshman attackman Jeff
Fritz had his best day as a col-
legian with five tallies and an as-
sist against the Red Dragons.

But the player of the week for
the Generals was junior defense-
man Tom Kiegler, who shocked
both opponents with three goals—
two against Cortland—while daz-
zling the crowds with his superb
stick handling.

W&L head coach Jack Emmer
may have put it best after the Sun-
day’s game. “Thank God for Tom
Keigler,’ Emmer said, echoing the
sentiments of nearly every W&L
lacrosse supporter.

The week in review

The most boisterous crowd of
the season saw W&L play a sloppy
first half against Roanoke, a team
that had never beaten the Gen-
erals in seven meetings.

After Chris Kearney gave W&L
its only lead of the first half at
1-0, the Maroons ran off three
straight goals before Rob Mor-
gan scored near the end of the
opening quarter.

Mike Hayden, Roanoke’s lead-
ing scorer, got an unassisted goal
30 seconds into the second period
to put the Maroons ahead 4-2,
which is how it stayed for the bet-
ter part of the quarter.

Sindler then put the first of his
three goals past Roanoke goalie
Bill Beroza at 12:43 to cut the
Maroon lead to 43, then Keigler,
who leads all defensemen in goals
scored, went the length of the
field to tie the game just 27 sec-
onds before halftime.

W&L took command in the third
stanza, taking the lead for good
on Donny Carroll's goal at 3:34.

Doug Fuge picks up a ground ball in lacrosse action against Cort-

land State.

Roanoke pulled to within one at
7-6, but goals by Carroll, Morgan,
and Jack Dudley put the game
away.

The Generals prevailed despite
being outshot, 49-42. W&L goalie
Charlie Brown came up with 20
saves, while Beroza had 18 for the
Maroons.

Sunday’s matchup with Cort-
land State proved to be one of the

least but most exciting games of
the year.

W&L held the Red Dragons
seoreless for nearly 28 minutes in
the first half while working its
fast break to perfection, setting
Fritz up for four of his five goals
to take a 5-0 lead. Extra man goal
by Mike Hoppey for Cortland and
Morgan gave the Generals a 6-1
lead at intermission.

Then the Generals, and the
crowd of 3000, appeared to go to
sleep. Cortland struck for four
unanswered goals in the third per-
iod to get back into the game at
6-5.

The Red Dragons retained the
momentum, coming back with a
goal for each one scored by W&L
until Hoppey’s third goal tied the
game at 9-9 with 9:12 left.

But as was the case against Roa-
noke, the Generals had an offen-
sive weapon no one counted on.
After breaking up a Cortland
clearing attempt, Keigler took a
feed from Carroll and bounced the
ball off a Red Dragon defender
into the goal to put W&L ahead by
one.

The Generals increased their
lead when Carroll, who finished
with five assists, passed to Dud-
ley, who fired a behind-the-back
shot past an unsuspecting Cort-
land goalie Wayne Werner.

Cortland’s John Walsh cut the
lead to one, 11-10, when he beat
Brown with a bounce shot from 12
yards out, but W&L again went
ahead by two as Doug Fuge scor-
ed with 3:30 left.

Then the suspense began. Just
fifteen seconds later, W&L de-
fenseman Rob Lindsey was found
to be playing with an illegal stick,
a violation accompanied by a
three-minute penalty.

However Cortland managed just
one shot in the extra-man situa-
tion before Brown came up with a
loose ball in the corner. The Gen-
erals controlled the ball for al-
most two minutes before Jay Sind-
ler avoided three Red Dragon de-
fenders and passed to Keigler,
who pumped a shot into the lower
corner to sew the game up.

Again the Generals were out-
shot, 62-38. However Brown came
up with a 24-save effort, perhaps
his best game of the season.

A letter
to the fans

To the Student Body:

History seems to repeat itself
when concerning the W&L-U.Va.
lacrosse game. The game has de-
veloped into an intense rivalry
without the additional pressure
of being selected for the NCAA
tournament which hangs upon
Saturday’s result. Yet for the sec-
ond consecutive year it is most
likely that the winner of this
game will receive an invitation
while the losing team hands in its
equipment.

The Washington and Lee play-
ers and coaches relish the thought
of travelling to Charlottesville to
discover that we'll have greater
support from our students than
that of the home team Cavaliers.
We've become reliant on our fans
to give us that extra boost when
needed but we are somewhat con-
cerned. A year ago we lost one of
our faithful fans from the student
body to a needless car accident
because booze and driving just
doesn’t mix. Our team counts on
your being there in force but we
also hope your support is positive
and we can avoid the destruction
done to the University of Virginia
stadium facilities as in 1974.

Most of all, however, we would
like to see you all back here safe-
ly on Monday to re-hash another
sweet victory over the Wahoos.
Four in a row sounds good to me.

Sincerely,
Jack Emmer
Coach of Lacrosse

But the nice thing is, no one
has to remember each parade, or
compare it to others. It’s simply
the catalyst that puts people in
the Mock Convention mood, acts
as a convention opener and gives
the towns people and students a
good time, all rolled into one.

And that’s no small feat in it-
self.

The convention is over, and
Doremus is almost back to nor-
mal. It is dark, and no one is
using it, obviously Dick Miller is
back in power. Two-thirds of the
rubber put down to protect the
floor is still there. Even the bas-
ketball hoops are still cranked
up so they can’t be used. Bunting
still hangs from the rafters, but
the mood is gone, This isn’t Con-
vention Hall anymore, it is Dore-
mus gym with rubber on the floor

 

and red, white and blue flags
hanging from the rafters.

But it had its moment. For a
few hours, the room was alive
with purpose, filled with cur-
rents, cross-currents and under-
currents of political and emotion-
al drama.

There was the serious side.
Full of the tradition of 10 of 15
right conventions in 68 years, the
delegates, chairmen, steering
committee, and most of all, the
PR director were out to “get it

right.” There were phones all
over the place—a fifteen-phone-
room, phones in the press gal-
lery, phones in the gym offices.
“If you don’t know, call and
find out” seemed to be what they
were saying. “We can’t afford to
get this one wrong.” And in the
name of “party unity” they tap-
ped Governor Jimmy Carter, a
Georgia peanut farmer who
smiles a lot.

There was also a light side to
the convention. Fun and _ horse-

were called from the grave, Cal-
vin Coolidge, Alf Landon, Richard
Nixon.

There were even some serious
candidates, men like Dale Bum-
pers, Adlai Stevenson, Jerry
Brown, Edmund Muskie, Morris
Udall, and George Wallace. But
they all lost out in the resound-
ing voice vote which picked a
Senator from Minnesota (who
else do we know from. that
State?) for the sake of “party
unity.”

One of the most ironic rumors
which came to rest on the floor
was that New York’s 200-vote
switch was not for the sake of
“party unity” at all, but because
beautiful ABC reporter Bettina
Gregory asked the steering com-
mittee to wrap it up before 2
p.m. because she had a deadline
and had to get back to New York.
Hmmm... ?

Of course the big question
now, and what will keep the Mock
Convention Steering Committee
on pins and needles until June,
is WERE WE RIGHT? Will the
real party follow our lead so we
can keep our record? And so,
we'll all wonder, will the party
come together, will it unify in the
face of the common foe, the Re-
publicans? Will it nominate
Jimmy Carter? Or, will Jerry
Brown beat Carter in the West,
sweep into the convention with
a momentum which can’t be stop-
ped and be chosen the “unity”
candidate?

As one candidate’s floor co-or-
dinator said to the co-ordinator
for the Georgia governor, “I still
hate the guy.”

Is that “party unity?”

beaten Virginia the past three
years, a W&L win will still be
considered a shocker in the eyes
of the media. After all, Virginia
is ranked sixth in the latest
USILA poll, their 5-4 record evi-
dently impressing enough of the
voters to keep them well ahead
of the 8-4 Generals.

Actually, the Cavaliers are 6-5
on the season, but one game on
each side of the ledger has been
nullified by protests based on tri-
vial rulings.

An allegedly illegal substitu-
tion cost Roanoke College its 11-
10 win over the Wahoos, while
Towson State successfully chal-
lenged Virginia’s 16-15 overtime
decision on the grounds that a
stick check that resulted in a
three-minute penalty had been re-
quested at an improper time.

There is little doubt that UVa.
should be somewhere in the poll’s
second five. Their four losses
have come at the hands of teams
rated second through fifth—
Maryland, Johns Hopkins, Navy,
and North Carolina.

Yet have the Cavaliers earned
the number six spot in the rank-
ings? The facts would indicate
otherwise. For one, UVa. has not
been closer than three goals in
any of its losses.

Then there is the question of
the quality of those teams Vir-
ginia has beaten. The Wahoos
have recorded impressive wins
over college division foes Wash
ington College and Maryland-
Baltimore County, but neither of

those teams are seeded higher
than fifth in their tournament.
The other three Cavalier wins
have come at the expense of
Franklin and Marshall, William
and Mary, and Duke, schools
feeling privileged to be men-
tioned in the same breath with
Johns Hopkins or Maryland.

All of this is not to infer that
the Cavaliers are not a good la-
crosse team. They did take de-
fending national champion Mary-
land into overtime before the
Terps flexed their muscles and
blew UVa. halfway back to Char-
lottesville.

But the evidence is plentiful if
not overwhelming against the
Wahoos’ claim to a spot above
W&L (or even the unknown quan-
tities at Massachusetts and
Brown) in the USILA poll.

Once again the task of putting
Virignia in its proper place falls
to Washington and Lee. The Gen-
erals have responded—be it in up-
set fashion or otherwise—in each
of the past three seasons. Their
fans, the university community,
and most of the college lacrosse
world is hoping they'll do it
again.

Washington and Lee University’s Weekly Newspaper

 

Volume LXXV

By TOM RENTSCHLER

The University switchboard
operator, the head of reference
in MeCormick Library, the retir-
ing secretary to the dean of the
law school and the senior co-
chairman of the Mock Conven-
tion received Ring-tum Phi
Awards at last Thursday’s meet-
ing of the senior class.

The annual awards are present-
ed by the newspaper to members
of the faculty, staff, and student
body in recognition of contribu-
tions made to the academic and
extracurricular life on campus.

Usually the awards are given
to several people whom the paper
feels deserve more recognition
than they have received.

Ring-tum Phi editor S. Yevich,
who presented the awards, ex-
plained that “no specific criteria
for selection are mandated, but it
is understood that each recipient
should have imparted on the W&L
community a bit of him or her-
self, exhibiting to the students
here that ‘little extra’ that goes
beyond what is required by duty
or position. Therefore the awards
were given to four individuals
who have all helped the university
in their own particular way.”

Receiving the first award was
an individual whose face is un-
known to most, but whose pleas-
ant and courteous voice has been
heard by virtually all at some
time or another. As switchboard
operator, Mrs. Agnes K. Gilmore
has added many a bright “good
morning” to the lives of virtually
every member of the W&L com-
munity.

But Mrs. Gilmore’s service to
the university ranges far beyond
her duties as switchboard opera-
tor. She is always glad to give
helpful information to people who
stop by her office in Payne Hall,
and she has often been of great
assistance to the English depart-
ment.

Second among the four recipi-
ents was Barbara Brown, associate
professor and head of reference
and public services in MeCormick
library. Miss Brown has aided
many students in researching
term papers and this year she
initiated a program to help
humanities and science students
find their way among the vast
stacks of reference material.

For the 1974-75 academic year
Miss Brown trained at UCLA in
a program which recognizes ex-
ceptional management potential
in the field of library science. She
is also a member of the board of
publishers of Shenandoah, W&L’s
literary quarterly.

Perhaps the one recipient who
has been the most devoted in her
service to the University is a
lady who has served the Wash-
ington and Lee Law school for
three decades, and who will re-
tire at the end of the current
academic year. Secretary to five
law deans, Mrs. Catherine Mc-
Dowell has helped many a student
in academic matters and _ in
preparation to enter the legal
profession.

Mrs. McDowell was recently
honored by the establishment of
a full tuition scholaship in the

law school in her name. Notably,
her husband was a member of the
law faculty for 41 years, and her
two sons are both distinguished
alumni of W&L.

Finally, the recipient of the stu-
dent award, which traditionally
goes to a member of the senior
class, was given to one of the
most politically active individuals
at W&L. Marston Reed Morgan, a
political science major, was co-
chairman of the Mock Convention
steering committee and was presi-
dent of the Convention.

Hlaving worked last summer for
Congressman Don Riegle of Michi-
gan, Morgan was well qualified to
give a great share of the guidance
for the plans of the $32,000 1976
Mock Democratic Convention. Of
course his most difficult duty may
well have been the task of presid-
ing over the convention, a task
which he handled admirably.

Abandoned kiln to be site for [Ibsen drama

By GRAY COLEMAN

The Troubadour Theatre will
wind up its eventful season with
a presentation of Peer Gynt, a
production of Henrik Ibsen’s ro-
mantic fantasy-epic, to be per-
formed by the Total Theatre
(Drama 139) class on May 24-26.

The location for the play is
the ruins of the old Lexington
Lime Kiln, a facility which oper-
ated within the last 50 years. In
recent years it has been seldom
used, aside from the renowned

Liberty Hall bicentennial noted

W&L marked a very special
bicentennial of its own last week
~—the 200th anniversary of its
carly name, Liberty Hall, repre-
senting the first official endorse-
ment of independence’ from
Britain by any educational insti-
tution in the Colonies.

The tiny, struggling classical
school was 27 years old in May,
1776, when trustees adopted the
new, revolutionary title.

It was two months before the
Declaration of Independence
would be signed. The school’s
name change “was a bold act of
defiance,” according to to an ac-
count by W&L’s 19th-century
historian, William Henry Ruffner,
“for up to this time the British
flag floated over the capital of
Virginia.”

AED initiates members

The Virginia Beta Chapter of
Alpha Epsilon Delta, the interna-
tional honorary pre-medical so-
ciety, held its annual spring initia-
tion Tuesday in Parmly Hall.

The following are the new mem-
bers: James Christmas, Landon
Garland, Marshall Jemison, John
Sacco, Philip Bailey, Mark Duncan,
Robert Jackson, Robert MeCord,
Robert Mucciola, David Trice,
Keith Teel, Shelby Bailey, Joel

Loving, William Burton, Brew
Houston, Chris Attinger, James
Ballou, Buddy Brothers, John

Cheairs, Michael Clary, Lee Gins-
burgh, Chris Johnson, Andrew
Dickens, and Howdy Knipp.

Following the ceremony the
members heard a speech from
Dr. Norman J. Knorr of the Uni-
versity of Virginia

No one is certain exactly how
or even when, the change came
about. In the minutes of the
trustees’ executive committee
meeting on May 8, 1776, the school
is still referred to as Augusta
Academy. In the minutes of the
same committee five days later,
on May 13, however, the institu-
tion is termed Liberty Hall.

According to Ruffner, “We are
left to surmise as to just when
and how the change was made,
but as the institution was then
not incorporated, probably there
was no legal difficulty in the way
of a change of name by anybody
having official control over the
school.... This band of patriots,
as we may reasonably suppose, on
the oceasion of the (May 13, 1776)
meeting, gave to the... school the
stirring name of Liberty Hall
Academy. Most likely the name
was suggested by Graham” —
William Graham, chief officer of
the school from 1774 to 1796.

The name Liberty Hall lasted
20 years——through the Revolution-
ary War and birth of the republic,
into George Washington's presi-
dency. In 1796 the Father of his
country rescued from bankruptcy
the school that had sided with
the forces of independence, by
donating stock eventually valued
at $50,000, and grateful trustees,
“this band of patriots,” changed
the name again to honor Wash-
ington.

Still fresh from his smash-hit
of last March, 1776, Dr. Al Gordon
returns to the director’s chair for
what may well be another suc-
cess, weather permitting. He ex-
plains the action of the play as
follows:

“Peer Gynt, the main character
of Ibsen’s fantasy, is a man who
will not commit himself to any
cause or person, and who ulti-
mately becomes selfless. His fate
is to be neither rewarded nor
punished, but to be melted down

by the Button Molder, who
pursues him throughout the
piece.”

The drama centers on Peer’s

adventures in Norway and Africa,
and calls for a set consisting of
piles of ruins. The Lime Kiln was

Whiteheads honored
with Lynchburg Citation

Mr. and Mrs. James Walter
Whitehead were recently awarded
the highest honor any Washing.
ton and Lee University alumni
chapter awards, the annual Lynch-
burg Citation.

Whitehead is treasurer of W&L,
secretary of the board of trustees,
and chairman of the university's
American Bicentennial Commit
tee. Together, the Whiteheads
have been responsible for bring
ing the Reeves Collection of 18th
and 19th century Chinese export
porcelain at W&L to a place of
nationwide significance among art
connoisseurs

The citation recognizes the
Whieheads’ “signal contributions
to the enrichment of life through
out the university community in
sensing opportunities for develop
ing unique new dimensions of
fiduciary feasance through the
symbiosis of finance and fine arts

by enhancing the aesthetic,
eultural and material value (of
WA&L’s art treasures); in strength
ening the university's image of
gentility and felicity by graci
ously opening their home and
their hearts to all friends and
patrons of Washington and Lee
and in perpetuating the excellence

of the past and faithfully honor-
ing tradition while always re
maining ‘not unmindful of the
future’.”

Primary among those exhibi-
tions is the current two-year
nationwide tour of 200 pieces
from the collection associated with
the American Revolution. That
traveling display is sponsored by
the Smithsonian Institution.

Adaptations to the setting were
carried out by set-designer Walter

tors Jim Moyler and Jim Feinman,
Dr. Gordon will also be assisted
by stage manager John Jacobsen
in his administrative chores.

Also, in such a fantastic pro-
duction, costumes and make-up
will be ambitious and imagina-
tive. Carried out by Hunt Brown
and Taylor Harbison (for cos-
tumes), and Brian Garr and John-
ny Hargrove (for make-up), work
is proceeding smoothly for the
approximately 50 different out-
fit sets.

Another point worth noting is
that the widow and daughter of
the translator, Kai Jurgensen, will
be present at the performances.
In previous years, Mr. Jurgensen
was a colleague of Dr. Gordon's
at the University of North Car-
olina.

Performances will be at 8:30
p.m. each night, and there is a
possibility of holding the show
over for one extra performance
on Thursday night, depending on
demand.

E.C. suggests action

on equipment removals

By JOE FITZGERALD

The Executive Committee voted
unanimously Monday night to
recommend that persons who have
checked out equipment from the
gym and not returned it be pre-
vented from matriculating or
graduating until the articles are
returned or replaced.

The vote followed a report from
E.C. junior representative and
secretary- elect Radar Davis that
damages, thefts and misplace-
ments in the gymnasium are well
above the $1000 figure quoted at
last week's meeting.

Property removed or stolen in-
cludes 700 towels costing $2 each,
$311 worth of equipment checked
out and never retnrued, 12 wall
clocks, two trash cans, two public
address speakers, weights, folding
chairs, a Virginia flag, and 30,000
bars of soap.

Davis said the soap was sup-
posed to last the entire year
but was gone by the end of the
Fall term. He also reported that
folding chairs are “popular” in
fraternity houses and that “People
don't take these towels seriously
at all.”

Davis also said that over $2000
worth of damage has been done
to the sound system at Wilson
Field.

Calyx editor outlines

organization of volume

By MALCOLM GRAHAM

Bill Thomson, this year’s editor-
in-chief of the Calyx, recently an-
nounced the final plans for the
publication, to be distributed on
or around May 21.

“This year’s format is one of
the most organized we’ve had in
several years,” commented Thom-
son. “There will be no gimmicks,
no records, and no games. Instead,
we tried to rely on good photo-
graphy. This was always our
strongest point, and it’s about time
we exploited it to the fullest.”

Not only can the new Calyx
claim an innovative format, it is
also the first yearbook to include
a Mock Convention spread in the
Same year as the convention it-
self. “It was necessary to twist a
few arms, but we have seven
impressive pages as a result,” said
the editor.

In addition to Thomson, others

Letters
To he Editor

Editor, the Ring-tum Phi:

In regard to your article on the
Mock Convention Parade, specific-
ally the order in which the floats
were to appear. Somewhere, some-
body along the line didn’t do their
research. Your article states, ‘““The
floats were arranged in the order
of a state’s entrance into the
union ...”. I watched the parade,
but I observed that this was not
the case. Delaware was the first
state in the United States, “the
state that started a Nation...”,
and the float for Delaware was
nowhere near the front. So, be
it your mistake or someone else’s,

Washington and Lee proved it
could win a big lacrosse game in
a convincing fashion Saturday,
dominating arch-rival Virginia all
over the field to record a 15-9
decision that moved the Generals
into the NCAA lacrosse tourna-
ment for a fifth consecutive year.

W&L, 9-4, drew undefeated
Cornell in the first round, played
yesterday in Ithaca, N.Y.

The win was also the fourth in
a row for the Generals over the
Cavaliers, 5-5, who saw their
playoff hopes ended by a five-
goal second-period outburst by
W&L.

“Our kids turned in a dominat-
ing performance,” W&L coach
Jack Emmer said, indicating the
Generals probably had their best
game of the season.

The final outcome could have
been more lopsided except for
three unanswered goals midway
through the third period by Vir-

Delts establish fund

Delta Tau Delta social fra-
ternity has established an annuity
valued at almost $12,000 to benefit
its long-time employee, Reid
Colbert.

The annuity was presented to
Mr. Colbert at ceremonies in his
honor during the recent W&L
alumni weekend. He was the guest
of honor at a party of alumni
and current students at the fra-
ternity house and was also singled
out for special recognition at the
lacrosse game later that day.

Mr. Colbert has worked for
Delta Tau Delta for 43 years. The
annuity which current members
and alumni of the local chapter
have funded will provide an in-
come for him and his wife when
he retires.

Leaders in the campaign to raise
funds for the annuity were Paul
Cromelin, president of the fra-
ternity last year, and Mynders
Glover, treasurer. Working with
them was an advisory committee
of Delta Tau Delta alumni who
are now members of W&L’s fac-
ulty and administration, including
President Robert E. R. Huntley,
Admissions Director James D.

Richard given award
for creative writing

The English department has an-
nounced that only one award was
made this year in the Mahan
Creative Writing contest: the
award for sophomore prose which
was won by Mark Richard, class of
1978, for an untitled short story.
The award is good for a prize
of sixty dollars in cash (or a
deduction of one hundred dollars
from next year’s tuition costs).

Very, very few entries for this
year’s contest were received, a
disappointment to the judges. But
the department hopes that next
year will bring a major revival
of student interest.

Those students whose entries
were not awarded prizes may pick
up their manuscripts from the
secretary of the English depart-
ment in Payne 31.

ginia, cutting W&L’s 10-3 margin
down to four.

“We lost our edge a couple of
times in the second half,’ Emmer
said, “But both times we got a
quick goal that put us back in
command.”

W&L was able to control the
ball for most of the rain-plagued
contest because of the work of
freshman Jim (Mario) Babcock,
who controlled 20 of 28 faceoffs
to earn the game ball.

“Sure it was fun to have a
game like that against Virginia,”
Babcock said. He credited assist-
ant coach Dave Cranshaw with
spotting a flaw in his technique
that was preventing him from win-
ning many of his faceoffs.

Once the Generals had the ball,
they had little trouble sticking it
in the goal. The attack trio of
Rob Morgan, Jeff Fritz, and Chris
Kearney combined for ten goals,
while midfielder Donny Carroll
contributed four tallies and a
pair of assists.

in contrast, the high-scoring
Cavalier attack managed just one
goal in settled situations against
the W&L defense, which drew
words of praise from Virginia
coach Glenn Thiel.

“Tommy Keigler and Rob Lind-
sey are two of the best—in my
mind, they’re first-team All-Ameri-
cans,” Thiel said, adding that both
John Strock and goalie Charlie
Brown also had place somewhere
on the A-A team.

Brown turned in a solid per-
formance in the nets, making 14
saves and outplaying his Virginia
counterpart, Cam MacLachlan,
who appeared shaken after the
Generals’ second-period barrage.

After taking a 2-1 first quarter
lead, W&L blew the game open

Thursday, May 20, 1976

Generals demolish Wahoos

with five goals in as many minutes
early in the second stanza. Both
of Kearney’s scores came in that
period, including one which barely
rolled across the goal line past
a fallen MacLachlan.

The Generals appeared to be
headed for a runaway just after
intermission, as Morgan scored
twice while Fritz saw an at-
tempted pass end up behind Mac-
Lachlan to give W&L a 10-3 lead.

But the Wahoos came back with
four of the next five scores, in-
cluding a pair by Emmet Voelkel,
to stay in the game at 11-7.

Fritz and Carroll opened the
final period with goals on isola-
tion moves to increase the lead
to 13-7. Virginia again closed the
gap somewhat as Paul O’Brien

and Bruce Baker scored just 10
seconds apart midway through the
quarter.

The W&L defense then stopped
several Virginia scoring chances
before Morgan and Carroll salted
the game away with goals in the
final three minutes.

Little went wrong for the Gen-
erals, who were urged on _ by
nearly all of the 4500 hundred
fans in attendance.

All were in Scott Stadium to
see W&L “beat them damn Wa-
hoos,” but the win was put in
perspective by All-American Lind-
sey, who throttled Virginia’s Kris
Snider for the entire afternoon.
“That’s the Wahoos,” the Gen-
erals’ tri-captain said. “Now, who’s
next?”

Admissions up— considerably!

Preliminary statistics indicate
that the freshman class entering
in the fall will be largest in
W&L history.

According to James Farrar,
Director of Admissions, 421 stu-
dents are currently enrolled for
the fall semester, an increase of
42 over 1975. (This figure does not
take into account those men who
may cancel during the summer.)

Applications were off 99 this
year, down to 1300 from 1399
in 1975. Numbers of students ap-
plying had been increasing since
1968 until last year.

Sixty-one per cent Accepted

W&L accepted 791 applicants
this year, or 61% of those who
filed applications. Last year the
figures were 819 and 58%, re-
spectively. And this year to date
there have been 421 confirmations,
from 379 the previous year.

43 of those entering in the fall
were admitted under W&L’s Early
Decision Plan. Five students are
from Rockbridge County, leaving
the University the dilemma of
where to house the remaining 400
or so who will show in Sept.

No definite housing arrange-
ments have been made yet. Ac-
cording to Farrar, specific plans
for handling the overflow will not
be made until it is seen just how
many applicants will withdraw
their confirmations in the next
four weeks.

The University Theatre ended
its season this week with an out-
door staging of Henrik Ibsen's

poetic epic Peer Gynt. The pas-
toral setting of the old lime kiln
was enchanting and did much to
enhance this nineteenth century

Norwegian classic. Unfortunately,
the production did not live up to
its backdrop.

There are certain’ inherent
problems in Peer Gynt that must
be overcome before the play can
be successfully staged. Its prolix
nature demands a plethora of

dated in Davis and also in Lee
I and Il. But that still will leave
a good number of men “home-
less.” Suggestions range from ex-
cess fraternity space to a few
floors of the Robert E. Lee Hotel.

Farrar, while surprised at the
response this eyar, is nonetheless
pleased at the results of this
year’s admissions efforts. The
yield (the number of confirma-
tions over the number of those
accepted) is 53%, the highest
ever except for 1965, when the
ratio was 54%. Preliminary
figures also suggest that this will
be one of the most highly quali-
fied classes in recent W&L his-
tory.

Although the Admissions staff
will not know for sure until the
results of the freshman survey
are compiled after Orientation, it
appears that this year’s acceptance
rate indicates a higher percentage
of applicants who filed at only
two or three colleges rather than
applying at half-a-dozen schools.

Management team for W&L dining service will remain the same when the University brings it under its
wing this summer: from left, Rodney Rogers, baker; Charles Dunn, chef; and Jerry Darrell, manager.

WeéL assumes Evans control

W&L will bring its dining-hall
service under its own manage-
ment at the end of the current
academic year and has named
Gerald J. Darrell permanent man-
ager of the operation.

Until now, the university, like
many other colleges and similar
institutions, has contracted with
ARA-Slater Services Inc. to pro-
vide food service to resident stu-
dents and for university functions.

Darrell has been Slater’s resi-
dent manager at Washington and
Lee since 1970.

University officials said the
move is being made to assure

the greatest possible economy and
efficiency, while maintaining a
superior level of meal service.
The university credits Darrell
with keeping costs low and qual-
ity high as well as with building
an extraordinary rapport with stu-
dents. In four years, the cost of
the 21-meals-a-week plan at W&L
has risen only $150, from $600 to
$800 next year, despite a dra-
matic rise in the cost of food
and the cost of preparing it, a
university spokesman said.
Darrell said he plans no per-
sonnel changes in the dining hall
when he brings it under W&L

Curriculum committee reviewed

By J. MICHAEL GALLAGHER

The Curriculum Committee here
at W&L has in the past performed
the function of conducting a sur-
vey of courses to inform the stu-
dent body, professors, and in-
coming freshmen how different
courses and different professors
rate in the eyes of the students.
This survey should not be in-

in play,
an asset

scene changes as well as a
shortening of Ibsen's original
script. Technically, Mr. Roman-

chuck and his students did an
admirable job with the numerous
rearrangements of the set. The
only exception to this was the
attempt to portray the sinking of
Peer’s yacht at the beginning of
Act Il; it would have been better
were it left out than to be treated
so amateurishly.

Another difficulty in doing this
play is that while it is meant to
be a spectacle, the psychological
subtleties must not be forfeited
for grandiosity. Bill Hirschmann,
in the title role, offered a super-
ficial portrayal of a very complex
character. An honest interpreta
tion of Peer demands the dis-
play of a wide range of emotions
Mr. Hirschmann tended to remain
at an emotional high. He did not
investigate the multi-faceted per-
sonality that makes Peer Gynt
the archetypal figure that he is.
Technically, however, the actor
did a fine job with an extremely
difficult role.

The translation and adaption
chosen for the production varies
from the original in many ways
The most important difference is
in the role of the Button Molde:
Mr. Jurgensen’s adaption greatly
expands this part, making it sec-
ondary only to Peers in im
portance, And while Taylor Harbi
son gave a consistant perform-
ance, one had the impression that
much more could have been done
with this role

The criticism of
ance would again have to be
that the spectacular aspects of
the character were blown out of
proportion. Consequently, the
complexities of the Button Mold

his perform

(Continued on page 4)

terpreted as a vendetta against
the faculty, but rather as a means
of conveying to the faculty and
administration student ideas
about the curriculum.

Data used to be collected three
times a year until professors’
complaints about the survey dis-
rupting their class schedules
reduced it to twice a year, and
this year to only once. After the
compilation of the data, copies
are distributed to the individual
professors; the heads of the dif-
ferent departments; the deans of
the school and two copies (for
student use) to the library.

How is the survey regarded’
During registration, the survey is
in great demand by the students.
But it is debatable whether or
not the faculty pays any attention
to it. It seems as though the
faculty is divided on the question
of the student survey. Some fac-
ulty think it is a useful device
that will help them improve their
course and possibly their methods
of teaching. Some even go so far
as to make suggestions for ques-
tions that could possibly be added
to the survey.

Then there are those on the
other side of the fence, who be-
lieve that the students aren't
qualified to rate their professors

‘In a mental institution, the
patients don’t rate their doctors.”
It is also thought that the survey
only sets a disharmonic atmos-
phere among the faculty. It has
a tendency to injure the feelings
of some, and ruffle the feathers of
others.

Other faculty believe that the
survey is only a popularity con-
test and doesn’t actually give a
true evaluation of teachers and
courses; therefore, it doesn't serve

a useful purpose. One outspoken
faculty member remarked, “At
the University of Michigan or any
other Behemoth University, such
an evaluation could serve a use-
ful purpose when there are thous-
ands of faculty members; but
W&L is about as small as three
telephone booths. The ‘grapevine’
would do the job.” These faculty
believe that the dorm counselors
and upperclassmen should pass
the word about courses instead of
a formal survey doing the job.

Washington Hall seems to sup-
port the committee in its under-
takings. Dean Watt says the com-
mittee is doing a fine job, but he
would ask a couple of different
questions and remove some exist-
ing questions from the survey.
Though he believes that the sur-
vey is accurate in its findings
about courses and teachers, he
never makes any recommenda-
tions when studying salaries for
the upcoming year.

While the survey is the most
important function of the six man
committee, it isn’t the only one.
Besides directly reporting to the
E.C., it has two members who
sit on the faculty Committee of
Courses and Degrees. They make
recommendations about the cur:
riculum to the committee, and
receive suggestions about the
survey in return,

Next year’s committee, co-
chaired by Carl Baker and
Tom McCarthy, plans to rid itself
of the do-nothing label it has
acquired during the past years
and adopt a work-horse attitude
for next year. There are going to
be two surveys next year, one in
the fall and one in the winter

management. He said his two key
employees under Slater’s manage-
ment of the dining service will
remain in their posts with the
new arrangement—chef Charles
Dunn, who came to W&L five
years ago after a decade at Roa-
noke College, and baker Rodney
Rogers, a 13-year veteran at W&L
under the Slater system.

Darrell said he also plans a
staff reorganization which will in-
volve promotions from within the
existing staff and which will also
create additional student jobs.

Currently, the dining hall under
Slater management has a full-
time staff of 15 and six part-time
employees, as well as 35 students
who earn part of their college
costs by working in the dining
hall.

This year there are 470 students
who eat their meals regularly in
the dining hall. The service also
has a considerable amount of ban-
quet, catering and other special-
event business for university-re-
lated events from meetings of the
Board of Trustees to student
groups. In recent years the din-
ing-hall service has also become
much sought-after for dinners
sponsored by civic and other local
organizations which involve mem-
bers of the W&L community,
ranging from the Rockbridge
Historical Society to area garden
clubs and the Chamber of Com-
merce.

Frequently Darrell plans special
events for his student patrons,
from outdoor barbecues to
“theme” dinners and elaborate
spreads to mark holidays.

Farewell

For many students the academic year will grind to a halt
on Monday. For seniors, though, the finish is postponed until
next Thursday, when they receive their diplomas from Presi-
dent Huntley, flip their tassels to the left, and step out into
the cold, cruel, “real” world,

Four years of life in Lexington, a life of grueling studies,
of nights spent down the road, of times both good and bad;
four very long and yet exceedingly short years will suddenly
come to an end for you, the Class of 1976, You will be leaving
this sleepy little town without streets and embarking on a
new voyage in your lives, and at a time when conditions are
slowly improving, but still quite difficult economically, socially
and politically.

We feel confident that those of you who are about to leave
here will come to grips with any problems you happen
upon and overcome them handily, Washington and Lee has
hopefully taught you how to cope with more than just term
papers and lab practicals and comprehensive exams. Your
time spent in Lexington has presumably benefited you in a
variety of ways, aiding you in your mental, physical, and
spiritual development. All those mid-terms, Red Square and
Pavilion parties, late-night bull sessions, road trips and tubing
trips, cramming for exams, Truck-Stop runs, and afternoons
at Wilson Field have had their effects on each of you, and
hopefully you are better men for it.

We hope that you graduates-to-be are leaving W&L with
a deep appreciation for the school and for what it has done
for you. We extend our best wishes and hopes for successful
careers, whether they entail further education, a year off for
contemplation, or a foray into the business world, To the
Class of '76 we also say, “Thanks for the contributions you
have made to Washington and Lee during your stay here.”

(none in the spring because of
lack of time and funds). They
plan on improving their public
relations with the faculty, and
reducing the number of com-
plaints they have had in the past
about the haphazard running of
their program. While these actions
will no doubt improve the quality
of the survey, the committee (for
the first time) will also follow up
on the results of the survey and
demand some action. Their im-
mediate target for next year will
be the Math Department.

The average failure rate for the
whole university is 3.4%, while
the Math department’s is 13.8%.
McCarthy attributes this to the
department’s 101 and 102 cal-
culus courses. McCarthy argues
that some incoming freshmen are
not qualified to take calculus
courses, but do so anyway to
fulfill their distribution require-
ments.

Although there are four other
departments offered in Division
Ill, McCarthy says the freshmen
choose math because they are
more familiar with it. As a result,
close to 11% of the freshmen
who take math are “weeded out.”
Therefore, the commitee is going
to push for a pre-calculus course
concentrating on trigonometry to
prepare underqualified students
for the calculus. The course
would count three credits, but
not count towards distribution

The broadcast also explores the
history of the Mock Convention
with particular emphasis on 1924,
when the W&L students chose
John W. Davis, correctly—but to
the surprise of observers at the
time—and on 1956, when former
Vice President Alben Barkley,
then a U.S. Senator from Ken-
tucky, collapsed and died as he
was delivering the keynote ad-
dress at W&L.

He likened it to English 100.

Professor Roberts, head of the
Math department, doesn’t believe
a pre-calculus course would help
much, and doesn’t think many
students would take it because it
would be an underlevel course.
He considers the high failure rate
as normal in comparison to other
universities, and gives the reason
as the department’s efforts to
“deliberately change the concep-
tions of intended math majors
about math.”

He believes that many of the
incoming freshmen take math for
one of two reasns: a.) they really
want arithmetic, b.) they like
science and liken math to science.
Math, he says, is not a science by
the conventional understanding of
science. It is more abstract, more
theory, while science can be di-
rectly applied; and being theory,
it is certainly not arithmetic
(working with numbers).

Roberts is opposed to a pre-
calculus course. Most entering
freshmen have a good background
in math for calculus. If some
freshmen do have an inadequate
background in math for the cal-
culus, it is because they didn't
learn it, and not because they
were underexposed. The depart-
ment wouldn’t be able to teach it
to them, because they would be
bored by pre-calculus, having
probably already been exposed to
it in high school and not learn-
ing it. Roberts believes a pre-
calculus course would actually
form a barrier between the stvu-
dents and calculus. Besides, cal-
culus 101 doesn’t have any trigo-
nometry in it and a good math
student should be able to pick up

He would implement a pre-
calculus course though, if there
were a strong demand for it, but,
“I have to be convinced of a
contribution to people’s educa-
tion.” In talking with Washing-
ton Hall, it seems there exists a
strong agreement with and sup-
port of Roberts’ position.

Next year will definitely show
whether or not a committee with
a formerly passive role can suc-
cessfully take upon itself an
active role in determining the stu-
dent body curriculum. Even if
unsuccessful in their first quest,
they still would have made the
attempt, which is something the
committee lacked in the past. It
would be to the benefit of the
student body if more student com-
mittees followed up on their sur-
veys and saw their ideas through
to the end.

Peer Gynt: a fine job

er’s personality were lost in this
display of showmanship.

The best performances of the
evening were given by Warren
Mowry as the Goblin King and
by Mrs. Kahn as Aase. The latter
was particularly effective as
Peer’s old mother; though she
may hit him with her cane a few
times too often. Other notable per-
formances were given by Brian
Garr and Tama Natkin, both in
various supportive roles.

Overall, Dr. Gordon and the
University Theatre did a fine job
with a very difficult play. The
major underlying fault was a mis-
interpretation of Ibsen’s inten-
tions for the work. Peer Gynt is
meant to be fantastical and spec-
tacular, but it is also a serious
study in human psychology. The
cast created an imbalance by
pushing for too many laughs and
by ignoring the profundity of
Ibsen’s characterizations.

New library bids proposed

By the News Staff

New bids for the proposed
library have been submitted to
W&L, but there is only a remote
possibility that site preparation
may begin within the next year.

According to Frank Parsons,
Assistant to the President, new
construction bids were sought
because the previous one were
outdated and rendered practically
useless by the effect of inflation.

In April of 1974, when the last
cost estimates were submitted,
the total project cost for the
library, including all sitework,
was $8.7 million. Adding incre-
ments for the past two years, in-
flation, the University had a
figure of $10.7 million, an amount
that was considered unreasonably
high and somewhat inaccurate.

A totally new assessment was
deemed advisable, so that realis-
tic figures could be available for
planning purposes. The new bids
have been developed, and the
current cost is estimated at $9.2
million.

Deducting architectural fees
that have been paid and landscap-
ing and furnishing costs that
would not be incurred for sev-
eral years, the immediate project
cost is reduced to about $7.8 mil-
lion. The contractors who sub-
mitted the bids have indicated
that construction costs will con-
tinue to climb in the future.

It is thought that the Board of
Trustees may approve commence-
ment of the site preparation when
a major portion of the needed
funds are in hand. A continuing
impediment to the construction
is the existence of a large out-
standing loan assumed by W&L
to cover construction costs for
Doremus Gym; that loan was in-
curred when interest rates were
uncomfortably high. It would be
desirable to retire the debt be-
fore any major new project is
undertaken.

To date several million dol
lars have been collected that
might be applied to the library
construction.

Much of the efforts of the De-
velopment Office are being turned
toward retiring the gym loan and
raising enough money to begin
the library project. According to
the original timetable, funds for
the library were to have been
raised by this year, and the
people working on the develop-
ment program realize the press-
ing need for a new undergraduate
library facility.

Automatic Rule

The Committee on the Auto-
matic Rule will meet at 1:30 a.m.
on Tuesday, June 8, 1976. At that
time the Committee will consider
the following groups of students,
who have fallen under the Auto-
matic Rule, for possible immediate
reinstatement:

1. those students who failed to
meet the conditions of Academic
Probation required of them at the
end of the current Spring Term;

2. those students completing a
full academic year who failed to
meet the cumulative average re-
quired of their class.

The Committee will consider for
immediate reinstatement all stu-
dents who fall under the Auto-
matic Rule. If any student wishes
to inform the Committee of ex-
tenuating circumstances present
in his case, he may write a letter
to the Committee and deliver it
to the Office of the Dean of the
College before June 7. Immediate
reinstatement is the exception
rather than the rule.

As soon as possible after the
Committee’s meeting, each stu-
dent falling under the Automatic
Rule will receive a letter ex-
plaining his status; his parents
will receive a copy of that letter.
Any student who is not sub-
ject to the Automatic Rule in
June and who fails to achieve
the cumulative average required
at the end of a full year for his
class will be on Academic Proba-
tion for the Fall Term, and he and
= parents will receive notifica-
ion.
