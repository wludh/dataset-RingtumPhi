Wilson letter warns of new drug policy

By Brooke Jarabek
Staff Reporter

 

This summer, President John Wil-
son mailed a letter to students to warn
them of a change in Judge George
Honts’ courtroom policy towards stu-
dents found guilty of possession or
distribution of illegal drug charges.

In his letter Honts claimed that ‘‘the
effects of this court to deal with the
[drug] problem have been unsuccess-
ful...in terms of deterring the contin-
ued presence of illegal substances
among the student body in substantial
quantities.”’

He further stated in response to the
problem that the court [must] re-think

' its sentencing philosophy.”’

“‘My purposes,’ he continued,

“‘are to alert the students that in seri-

* ous drug charges upon conviction they
may face substantial losses of liberty,
money, and civil rights.’’

Not only are the courts planning
stricter enforcement of the drug laws,
but according to Lewis John, Dean of
Students, ‘‘There is no question that
the police in town are going to enforce
more strictly under-age possession
and consumption of alcohol in pub-

Tradition
remains

at W&L

By Brooke Jarabek
Staff Reporter

 

' The W&L campus may have
_ changed over the past 123 years, but
the tradition of the Honor Code has
remained, according to one message
in English Professor Sidney Coullings
" speech to the Freshman Class.

The Honor Code has indeed re-
mained; however, revisions and
philosophical interpretations have
changed and molded it over the years
since Robert E. Lee first asked each

’ student to conduct himself as a
, gentleman.

Last spring, the Executive Commit-
tee voted on a few changes to the
White Book, the school’s honor
system guide.

One of the major changes allows a
third advisor or advocate to ‘‘be pre-

’ sent for the purpose of observation”’
. during closed hearings. This change
enables law students to gain experi-
ence by observing the proceedings.

. Thus, they are better able to serve stu-

dents at future hearings.

‘In order to insure confidentiality

during investigations prior to the hear-

" ings, the EC expanded Section III, O
+ to include ‘‘any student interviewed in

an investigation.’’ In the past although
students were warned that they would

be penalized for breaking the confi-

dentiality of the investigations, the

White Book only included ‘‘the ac-

» cused [and] any witness in an Execu-
tive Hearing’’ and did not apply to a
student interviewed but not called as a
witness.

Because the registrar’s office is
changing from hand-cut and pasted
transcripts to computerized tran-
scripts, the ‘whiting out method’’ to

’ denote whether or not a student is in
- good or bad standing has changed.
On the old manuscripts, the words
’ “Sin good standing’’ were typed to in-
. dicate that a student had not been de-
clared guilty of an honor violation. If
a student was charged with a violation
and withdrew before an executive
hearing or withdrew after being de-
clared guilty at the hearing, the regis-
trar simply omitted the words ‘‘in
* good standing.” If a student was de-
clared guilty, at the end of an open
trial, the words ‘‘in bad standing”’
were added to the transcript.

The new method, developed be-
cause the computer did not allow

‘ enough character space, uses the term
‘‘withdrew’’ to replace whiting out.
The term ‘‘dismissed’’ will replace
‘‘in bad standing.’’ If a student with-
draws for reasons not relating to an

~ henor violation, the term ‘‘withdrew”’

. W Il still be written on the transcript.

Another change excludes witnesses

ym the hearings while they are not

stifying. The reason for this change,
plained EC President Christopher

: Movellan, is because the commit-

2 ‘‘did not want witnesses remaining
and listening to other witnesses so in

» case they are recalled, their testimony

_ won't be changed or blemished by
what they have already heard.”’

De Movellan also explained that the
Committee did not change the Honor
Code to include student conduct such
as physical assault because, although

night when, as one sophomore who
requested anonymity noted, ‘‘Police
were crawling around everywhere
Saturday night. I almost got arrested
for walking around with an empty
cup.””

Along with local law officials, the
University faculty have also issued a
new stronger drug and alcohol policy.
Dorm counselors received a list of
non-discretionary or mandatory penal-
ties to be implemented in instances in-
volving illegal substances.

A freshman’s first infraction of the
no-use or possession of alcohol in the
dorms will result in four hours of ser-
vice. A second act will mean eight
service hours, and a third instance will
require a review by the Student Con-
duct Committee. Students will not
receive just a warning for their first
offense.

An automatic conference with the
Dean is a requirement for illegal drug
use Or possession.

Furthermore, in the past, students
arrested or hospitalized due to drug or
alcohol related instances did not
necessarily have to meet with the
Dean or other faculty member. Now,
however, a meeting with a faculty
member is required.

Dean John emphasized that this re-
sponse is ‘‘more counseling than puni-

é * . BS

(Left to right) Eddie Cameron, III, accepting for Eddie Cameron, ’24; Skip Rohnke, *60

tive.’’ He added, ‘‘In keeping with the
general spirit of the faculty, we will
want to talk to those students arrested
or hospitalized because of alcohol or
drug abuse.’’

One reas6n for this new policy is the
multiple attendance by W&L students
to the Stonewall Jackson Emergency
Room on certain weekends as a result
of alcohol related instances.

Dean John said, ‘‘If there is that
kind of abuse, the potential for some-
thing serious happening is there. As a
University, we have to face up to the
problems this creates.

Junior T.K. Bowers proved to be
slightly skeptical of the effectiveness
of the stricter laws. ‘‘I don’t believe it
will curb private drinking inside the
fraternities and at parties. It might
curb the mass public intoxications of
the good old days, and it will make
you be more careful in public.”’

Increased fear of liability and con-
cern with the new 21- year-old drink-
ing age has also affected the alcohol
policies at the fraternities.

Some national and alumni associa-
tions and corporations have prohibited
individual fraternity chapters from
providing alcohol out of private chap-
ter funds. In essence, this means kegs
are not allowed.

Hall of Fame’s first five
alumni inducted at game

 

Staff Report

 

A record-setting professional foot-
ball player and coach, a pioneer in the
Atlantic Coast Conference, one of the
finest basketball players to come out
of Virginia, a track star whose javelin
record still stands, and the winner of
16 varsity letters comprise the first
class of athletes to be inducted into the
Washington and Lee University Hall
of Fame.

The members of Hall of Fame’s in-
augural class are: Edmund M. (Eddie)
Cameron, ’24; Walter E. (Walt) Mi-
chaels, *51; Karl E. (Skip) Rohnke,
*60; Robert W. (Bob) Spessard, °39;
and Harry K. (Cy) Young, ‘17. The
inductees were chosen from a field of
70 nominees,

The Hall of Fame was established in
1987 by the board of directors of the
W&L Alumni Association to honor
and perpetuate the memory of those
individuals who have made outstand-
ing contributions to W&L athletics
and have helped bring recognition,
honor, distinction, and excellence to
the university and its intercollegiate
athletic program.

 

A native of West Virginia,
Cameron entered Washington and
Lee in the fall of 1920. A three-year
letterman in both football and basket-
ball, Cameron also served as captain
of both teams and was selected as All-
Southern Atlantic fullback. While at
Washington and Lee, Cameron served
as vice-president of the athletic coun-
cil, as president of the freshman coun-
cil, and as president of the monogram
club. He was also elected to Omicron
Delta Kappa, the national leadership
fraternity, in his sophomore year—an
unusual honor.

Upon leaving Washington and Lee,
Cameron worked as a coach before
going to Duke University where he
coached the Blue Devils to several
basketball championships. He served
as a long-time assistant in football to

the legendary Duke coach, Wallace
Wade. Cameron successfully coached
Duke to several football titles and one
Sugar Bowl victory during World War
II. He succeeded Wade as athletic di-
rector and remained in that position
until 1972. During his tenure at Duke,
Cameron served as chairman of the
basketball committees of the Southern
and Atlantic Coast conferences, where
he helped develop their tournaments
to national prominence. He was induc-
ted into the National Football Founda-
tion Hall of Fame in 1976.

Michaels was a member of the 1950
Washington and Lee football team,
the first and last football team ever to
represent the university in a_post-
season bowl game. Although the Gen-
erals lost to Wyoming 20-7 in that
game, the team finished 8-2 with
W&L’s first Southern conference
championship since 1934, and is gen-
erally considered the best football
team ever at Washington and Lee.
Michaels carried the ball 119 times in
his senior year for 712 yards—a 6.0
average—scoring 10 touchdowns and
kicking 29 extra points. He was
named second team All-Southern by
United Press International and third
team All-Southern by the Associated
Press.

Michaels started his professional
football career with the Green Bay
packers of the National Football
League, but gained prominence as a
linebacker for the Cleveland Browns
from 1952- -1961, where he was
named All-Pro several times. He ser
ved as an assistant coach with the New
York Jets and the Philadelphia Eagles
before returning to the Jets in 1976 as
head coach. He also served as head
coach of.the New Jersey Generals of
the United States Football league. Mi

Staggering arrest figures from last
Saturday’s rush activities and strict
warnings for those to come in the next
few weeks dominated Tuesday even-
ing’s Interfraternity Council meeting,
held at 7:30 p.m. in the University
Center.

Chief Beard of the Lexington Police
Force addressed the various rep-
resentatives of Washington and Lee’s
sixteen fraternity houses as well as the
Judicial Board that presides over the
council.

“Last Saturday night, this town was
out of control,’’ said Beard. Police ar-
rested twenty-nine minors in posses-

‘| sion of alcohol, as well as eight per-

sons for drunkenness in public, five
for Driving Under the Influence, and

 

ters from purchasing alcohol with
chapter funds when a party is hosted
by two or more fraternities. Rush

were in 1987, and all parties through
the end of Rush, September 26, are

six for littering. While Beard assured
that not all arrests were W&L stu-
dents, he pressed the fraternities’ re-
sponsibility for all persons in or
around their house at the time of a
party.

Responsibility was the theme for
Chief Beard’s speech, which stretched
through more than haif of the forty-
minute meeting. He reminded dele-
gates of the necessity in obtaining a
permit on the Thursday or Friday
preceding a party, and is requiring the
fraternity presidents to apply in person
for this week’s activities, placing them
in full responsibility for the occurren-
ces at their house. ‘‘We understand
that you are going to party, but you
have to understand that it is your re-
sponsibility ,’’ he summed up.

“I see the same repetition of this

hearing that each of the sixteen frater-
nity houses had already hired a band
to play Saturday night. ‘‘What are you
going to do to prevent this?’’ he asked
the presidents. ‘‘We cannot continue
the way that we’re going.”’

The general tone of the delegates
was that they would be more watchful
in enforcing the rules as laid down in
the By-Laws of the Interfraternity
Council Constitution. Among these,
the need for a brother at the door of a
party was stressed, but to regulate the
inflow and outflow of guests to the

served as captain of each team at
different times during his four years at
Washington and Lee. In track and
field, Rohnke received the Forest
Fletcher Trophy for the most points
scored in his sophomore, junior, and
senior years. He also received the
P.R. Brown Trophy for the most val-
uable athlete and the Wink Glasgow
Award for spirit and sportsmanship in
his senior year. As a junior, Rohnke
broke his own school record in the
javelin at the Penn Relays (200°

school record in the javelin (211°
3'%’’) that still stands.

In swimming, Rohnke was_ the
Southern League champion in the
50-yard freestyle, and conference
champion in the 400-yard medley. He
was awarded the Memorial Swimming
Trophy in 1958, the same year he
broke the school record in the
100-yard freestyle. In soccer, Rohnke
was a member of the first annual
VISA Tournament team and was
named All-South right fullback. Dur-
ing Rohnke’s years at Washington and
Lee, his teams compiled the following
records: track and field, 19-8; soccer,
24-14-3; and swimming, 27-4.

A native of Roanoke, Spessard at-

he starred in football, basketball, and

the fall of 1935 and made All-State in
basketball for three successive years,
1935-37. He was also named to the
All-Southern Conference team those
same three years.

At that time, the Southern Confer-
ence was among the strongest in the
country and included such teams as
North Carolina, Virginia, and other
Southern powers. During the Wash-
ington and Lee vs. North Carolina
game in 1936 Spessard scored 25

AIDS

Speaker alerts students
to the AIDS epidemic

AE NTO ESS EERIE LTE EID ELDER EEE
By Carli Flippen and Pamela Kelley

Staff Reporters

 

Addressing an audience primarily
of freshmen Monday night, Dr. Ri-
chard Keeling, Director of Student
Health at the University of Virginia
and chairman for the AIDS Task
Force on university campuses, spoke
on AIDS and other sexually transmit-
ted diseases.

Dr. Keeling’s lecture centered
around two common questions con-
cerning AIDS: What are the causes
and effects of AIDS? How can contact
with the AIDS virus be prevented?
Keeling combined a straight forward
attitude and humor to effectively con-
vey the AIDS/STD information to
students.

Keeling described the different vir-
uses that cause STDs, all of which be-
long to the ‘“‘HV”’ virus family. He
then explained how the AIDS virus at-
tacks the body’s immune system,
weakening it and leaving it vulnerable
to infection or disease and ultimately
death.

Keeling also discussed some of
America’s irrational fears about
AIDS. He deemed the cruel and/or
stand-offish attitude many take
towards AIDS victims as ‘‘emotional-
ism’’. To combat the fear of AIDS,
Keeling stressed that truth and myth
concerning AIDS must be separated.

He assured the audience that casual
contact, mosquitoes, or even kissing
cannot transmit the virus. However,
kissing may transmit other STDs such
as Herpes (Simplex IT) and Hepatitis.

Keeling stressed that although some
groups of people have a greater risk
for AIDS contraction, no one is im-
mune. He said that 3 of every 1,000
people may be carriers of the AIDS
virus and may infect others, and cited
statistics which state that by 1993,
drunk driving, murder, and suicide
will have been surpassed by AIDS as a
cause of death in the United States.

While Keeling said that abstinence
was the only 100% effective way to
escape AIDS infection, he suggested
that the correct use of condoms will
help reduce the risk of contact with the
AIDS virus. He also suggested that
drinking alcohol may dull ones judg-
ment, leading to unplanned experi-
ences that could bring them in contact
with the AIDS virus.

Keeling’s lecture was followed by a
report to the students by W&L physi-
cian Dr. Jane Horton-Marcella. She
revealed that the infirmary has dealt
with 186 students concerning STDs in
the past year. The visits ranged from
counseling for those with STDs to
testing or notification of those who are
at risk to contract an STD. Horton-
Marcella appealed to the students to
be responsible and make use of these
services available to them on campus
and stressed that all student informa-
tion concerning the virus is confiden-
tial.

AIDS/STD testing is available at the
university infirmary where one may
also discretely obtain condoms.

Horton-Marcella and Dr. Robert
Pickral, W&L’s Student Health Direc-
tors, and Keeling were on hand after
the lecture to answer questions.

W&L ranked

Washington and Lee University is
one of only two Virginia institutions
of higher learning to receive the
‘*most competitive’ ranking in the
1988 edition of Barron’s Profiles of
American Colleges.

The College of William and Mary is
the other Virginia school that received
the designation.

‘“*We are pleased that the volume

OPINION

Editorial
fascism

on the Phi

It is my privilege to inform students, professors, administrators,
employees, alumni (living and deceased) and other affiliates of the
Washington and Lee community that I have been appointed Editor-
ial Editor of The Ring-tum Phi. No one knows exactly how it hap-
pened, but many campus authorities believe that my appointment is
the work of a powerful fascist organization that is on a mission to
destroy The Ring-tum Phi. Other campus officials believe that it is
simply a joke that went too far. But regardless of who is responsi-
ble, the fact remains that I am now the Editorial Editor of the third
most important newspaper in the nation (after the N.Y. Times and
the Washington Post). I now have something that I have waited for
all my life—power. And just like Atilla The Hun who also started
out as the Editorial Editor of his college newspaper I plan to abuse

 

this power.

I am aware that many of my classmates, friends, and relatives do
not believe I am qualified for this astute position. These critics don’t
think I am experienced with important political positions. The truth
is that I was very recently involved in a career that required judg-
ment, fortitude, discipline and an orange helmet—the four charac-
teristics which mark a great leader. I know many readers are won-
dering what year I was President of the United States or Ambas-
sador to Nepal so in order to satiate this rampant curiosity I will

reveal my recent career.

As a fifth grader at Dale Mabry Elementary School in Tampa,
Florida, I was the Captain of the Patrols, responsible for making
sure that every single student returned home safely. Furthermore, I
was expected to maintain a crew of enthusiastic subordinate pa-
trols—all of whom were reaching the veritable apex of their rebel-
lious youth. As a Captain I was considered one of the best. It was
not uncommon to find me camouflaged in oak trees or crawling
through underbrush in order to catch derelict patrols sitting down
on the job or throwing rocks at each other. Throughout the year I
sustained an impressive record of 0 deaths—4 bloody noses—1 con-
cussion. Now that I have definitely proved my credibility I will
move on to the point of this editorial diatribe. We welcome letters,
criticism, essays, novels, diaries and anything else from any literate
member of the Washington and Lee community. Please bring any
submission to The Ring-tum Phi office in the University Center or
hand it to a trustworthy staff member unlike myself.

Nostalgic
words gnaw
at Senior

 

MY VIEW
By Susan C. Lewis

 

The shock can be overwhelming if
one thinks about it too long. The mail-
out sitting before me reads: ‘‘All
Seniors. The Career Development and
Placement Office Presents the Senior
Placement Meeting.’’ At the bottom
are even more ominous words: ‘‘Want
to have a job by the time you graduate
or soon thereafter? Then you must be-
gin now.”’ Begin now? But we’re all
supposed to have one more year of
college left—must we think about jobs
now? And to make sure it all hits
home even harder, Monday was
Senior Convocation—an event just to
honor us seniors, and to make us real-
ize that in a short nine months, we’ll
be walking down the Colonnade for
real, as our families watch eagerly.

It seems as if everyone I've talked to
cannot believe that the years have
flown by so fast. As we sit around,

talking and reminiscing, it seems like
only yesterday that we were the wide-

eyed freshmen who just arrived on
campus, It hardly seems possible that
the wild, exciting, and brand new ex-
periences of sophomore and freshman
years happened as long as two and
even three years ago. Looking back, I
distinctly remember the summer be-
fore sophomore year, when, in re-
sponse to the questions of friends of
the family, I eagerly exclaimed: ‘‘I
just can’t wait to get back to school!”’
They looked at me fondly, and re-
plied, ‘‘Don’t be so eager—you’re
wishing your life away.’’ At the time I
simply laughed their statement
off—not giving much thought at all to
anything except how much fun it
would be to be back at W&L. Now, as
an older and more mature (or so they
tell me) senior, I finally understand
what those people were trying to tell
me. Perhaps not completely, since
they have seen many more years pass
than I have, but enough so to realize
that every time I thought I simply
couldn’t wait for a specific event, I
was, in effect, wishing away—almost
wasting—every day in between.

But all these thoughts still leave me
and all my classmates with only nine
short months between us and gradua-
tion. Truthfully, at times I am not
looking forward to that at all. And it
isn’t simply because I am afraid to
face the ‘‘real world’’ in an attempt to

find a job (although at times, quite
honestly, that is a small fear). Much
more than that, it is the idea that my
four years at Washington & Lee are
drawing to a close. In my mind, this
university is one of the best in the
country—in more ways than one.
Academically, I have learned a great
deal here, and enjoyed doing
it—except a few all-nighters—thanks
to the wonderful professors here.
Also, what could be more relaxing
than stretching out in the sun, on a
warm spring day in front of the Co-
lonnade. Certainly few colleges offer
a more picturesque setting. Perhaps
most important are the deep friend-
ships which are fostered here. In part
because of the many experiences we
have shared, college friendships seem
to be the most treasured and meaning-
ful. I, for one, hope and pray that
these friendships will not diminish,
but instead strengthen, even as we
may physically be separated.

So, in many ways I dread the ap-
proach of June 1, 1989, but I hope
these are not selfish ways. I also hope
I will remember the basis of these re-
grets after graduation, so that I will
keep alive in practice those aspects of
life treasured most at W&L. If I may
leave one piece of advice to under-
classmen: take care to appreciate your
years here and do everything you want
to do for, as they say, these are indeed
the best years of your life. And to the
seniors—may this year be the best of
all four we’ve had here.

Man’s journey

from giant slugs
to the suburbs

 

By Jon Sbar

 

Soon after man evolved from the
Giant Slug, he started walking. His
walk soon became a mission of impor-
tance, a search for a vital necessity.
This vital necessity was not food,
clothing or shelter (only later did man
realize he needed these things), but an
experience that would soon come to be
known as a good time. Eventually,
man ran (walked) into other men and
decided that he was a social animal.
Man then proceeded to gather some
wood and form small tribal communi-
ties which the intellectuals began to
call the suburbs.

Everything went fine in the suburbs
until man discovered that some men
were women. Initially, the only no-
ticeable difference between men and
women was that men loved ‘‘The
Three Stooges’’ while women
detested them. But one late evening in
a dark cave a man everyone called Bill
discovered something he called
Unique Female Physical Characteris-
tics which made women more fun than
other men. The women decided the
same thing about the men and there-
fore started to wear make-up and
complain that they were getting fat

even though they never did anything
about it.

After Bill’s important discovery
men and women began living
together. Family life was peaceful and
satisfying—couples were happy with
simple pleasures such as drawing on
the cave walls. Males and females re-
mained on friendly terms for what
seemed like, and actually was,
thousands of years. In fact, some re-
lations were so good that men and
women went from their Giant Slug
days well into the twentieth century
without having an argument. Actu-
ally, they had one little disagreement
stemming from the invention of beer
which the men loved to drink while
they watched ‘‘The Three Stooges.”’
Because they felt that the men spent
entirely too much time doing this, the
women invented nagging. Tragic as it
may be, the days when men and
women could get along have become a
dim memory. Somehow that long era
of good feeling between the sexes
turned into a merciless war consisting
of relentless battles.

Male-female relations are currently
in a dangerously precarious position
and deteriorating every day. Modern

LETTERS

women read books like, ‘‘Men vs.
Blue-Green Algae; which makes a bet-
ter companion?’ ‘‘Zen without
Men,”’ and ‘‘101 Things to do if you’-
re Celibate.’’ Modern men, on the
other hand, have minimized their
reading to the three paragraph inter-
view of the ‘‘Playboy Playmate of thé
Year’’ which they believe holds the
answer to any philosophic, psycholo-
gical, or physiological question con*
cerning females. If the sexes cannot
improve their rapport in the very near
future, I fear they will split perman:
ently leaving man to drink beer and
watch ‘‘The Three Stooges’’ twenty-
four hours a day.

The male-female controversy has
become a top priority in the scientific
community. Although researchers

To the Editors:

I am writing this letter to make clear once and for
all the alcohol policy for the Wednesday night
bands in the GHQ. As most returning students
remember, there was an incident last spring, in
which an underage drinker was caught by the Vir-
ginia A.B.C. As a result, the GHQ was fined, lost
its beer license temporarily and was severely war-
ned that the next infraction of the A.B.C. laws
will result in a greater fine and possibly a perman-
ent loss of its beer license.

In order to protect our ‘‘Wednesday in the Pit’’
the managers have no choice but to create and en-
force a stricter drinking policy effective imme-
diately when the GHQ regains its beer license on
September 27. In order to purchase beer, ALL

students must show two forms of ID:

1. A valid drivers license with photo or a state
identification card with photo.

2. A second form of ID such as a college ID or a
military ID.

A college or military ID will only be considered
secondary identification and will not be accepted
unless presented with a valid drivers license or
state ID card. This is in accordance with the VA
ABC alcohol purchasing policy.

All GHQ employees have the right to card any
customer at any time. Any person who presents a
false ID will have it confiscated and it will be
turned into the VA ABC. If the ID has come from
a W&L student, that student will be referred to the
E.C. and/or the §.C.C. for appropriate action.

Any person who is found drinking underage will
be ejected and referred to the S.C.C,

I would like to address another issue now, be-
fore the pit reopens. Many students complain that
the presence of a strong honor system should al-
low legal drinkers to drink without showing ID or
just a Washington and Lee ID. Unfortunately, the
ABC doesn’t agree. We must follow their guide-
lines if we want to continue to operate as a tavern ,
in any Capacity.

Please keep in mind that these rules are not ’
meant to keep people from having a good time,
merely an effort on our part to retain our beer |i-
cense.

New abscence policy causes very few problems

 

By Becky Reynolds
Staff Reporter

 

The new clarification of professors’
attendance policies commenced this
week with little « ntroversy from stu-
dents or professors but its really too
early to tell, University Registrar D.
Scott Dittman said.

Dittman said that so far he has not
received any complaints or problems
concerning the new clarification. “‘Its
too early to tell. 1 don’t expect feed-
back on this until the middle of next
week,”’ he said.

The 1987 Faculty Handbook says
that because W&L offers such a wide
range of classes and teaching styles, a
student’s participation in a course

 

Philip Morris

cannot be prescribed on a University-
wide bSasis. ‘‘For this
reason...attendance in class and
laboratory is a matter between the stu-
dent and the faculty member.”’

Last spring, a clarification was ad-
ded that said, *‘Faculty members may
require a previously registered student
to drop a class if the student misses the
first class meeting of the term without

A Washington and Lee alumnus was
indicted last week by a Rockbridge
County grand jury and accused of
stealing porcelain worth approxi-
mately $10,000 from the university’s
Reeves Center.

R. William Mercer, 22, who gra-
duated from W&L in June 1988, will
be arrested Friday, according to Lt. _
Steve Crowder of the Lexington®
Police Department.

longing to the center on or about Aug.
4, 1988.

Mercer worked at the Reeves
Center as an undergraduate and also
worked at the center during the sum-
mer after he graduated, according to
John Elrod, Dean of the College.

Elrod said Mercer ‘‘was a good stu-

dent here’’ and said he was confident
“that the courts will do the right
thing.’’ Elrod called the arrest ‘‘a
very unfortunate set of circumstan-
ces.””

University officials said the artifacts
were safe but refused to discuss details
of the case, saying that W&L em-
ployees may be called to testify.

Tavern renaissance -
replaces ‘60s decor

 

By Heidi Read
Editor

 

A new General’s Headquarters?
Maybe not new, but definitely im-
proved.

Monday’s opening of the GHQ after
a summer remodeling project left
people waiting on the steps to get in
during the lunch rush, according to
Gerald J. Darrell, director of Univer-
sity Food Services.

Darrell said he had hoped to have
the remodeling completed earlier so
that equipment could be tested and
staff could get accustomed to the new
setup, but it didn’t work out that way.
Instead, he has been ‘‘acting chef”’ at
the GHQ.

Darrell said it will take time to ad-
just to the new setup, ‘‘but eventually
customers will not wait more than
15-20 minutes to get served.

 

What do y

 

 

 

 

“Ttch”’
‘*My Mother’’—‘‘I think it’s ex-
cessive. The school should have no
interest in what people do in their
own time.””

Chaffe, senior,

 

from

Lee Ann Foster, sophomore,
Rome, GA—‘‘It would be better
for the school to do more counsel-
ing as opposed to being kicked out
of school.”’

‘*We haven’t done it yet, but we
will. We’re going to make it.’’

The GHQ, formerly the Cockpit,
was built in 1969 as part of the Uni-
versity Center. It was intended to be a
student tavern, Darrell said, but in the
process of its construction it was real-
ized that Virginia law required that
hot food be served with alcohol.

Darrell requested a larger kitchen
five years ago, but the GHQ remodel-
ing was not a priority in the University
budget until this year, he said.

Beginning the day after graduation,
a construction crew worked every day
of the summer, ‘‘gutting out’’ the old
kitchen, enlarging it, installing new
equipment, making a new U-shaped
bar and rearranging the seating.

The new kitchen is three times the
size of the old one, which Darrell said
was intended to be a storage closet.
Even after the remodeling Darrell
said, ‘‘It still looks like we have more

”

room.

prior approval of the instructor.”’
Dittman said that this clarification
was added last spring because of prob-
lems of controlling enrollment. He
said, ‘‘Professors need to know who is
going to be in the class especially in
Spring term. They need to have con-
trol over their class enrollment.”’
Dittman also pointed out that stu-
dents who do not attend first classes
but do not drop them are being unfair
to other students who want to get into
closed classes. ‘‘The biggest day of
drop/add week in every term is Fri-
day, which is almost too late for oth-
ers to add classes. It’s just not fair to
the other students,’’ Dittman said.
Kathy Jo Koberstein, Assistant
Professor of Romance Languages,
said that she supported the new clari-
fication because her classes almost in-
variably wind up with a waiting list.
Koberstein said that she did let one
student into a class on Monday be-
cause of the new rule but also let a

student who missed the first class stay
enrolled in it because he had a
reasonable excuse.

“*T wouldn’t enforce it except in a '

class where there is a waiting list. We
need to know if a student is in the
class, especially in the Department of
Romance Languages,’’ Koberstein
said.

Professor of Romance Languages
Sidney J. Williams, Jr., said that the
new clarification has not affected him
yet, but it may by next week.

Henry Sharp, Jr., Professor of
Mathematics, said that the new policy
would cause no departmental change
but that he could not speak for indivi-
dual professors. About his own pol-
icy, he said, ‘‘I will handle absences
very much the same as always.”

According to Junior Leigh Ann
Brown and others, the new clarifica-
tion seems difficult to follow before
the first day of classes for those who
are not oriented with their professors.

Brown said, ‘‘There are too many
innocent situations that could come up
on the first day and ruin students’
schedules. It may be an appropriate
policy for students who sleep through
their classes but not for those with real
excuses.

“I question whether many profes
sors are really taking it [the new clari
fication] to heart. Almost all of the
professors here are very reasonable
and understanding so I don’t foresee
them doing much to those innocent
students. ”’ :

In a letter to all -W&L undergra
duates, Dittman requested that profes
sor’s instituting the new policy con
sider the University’s recognition of
the importance of holy days and to
make needed accommodations for
students’ observances, which was es-
pecially important this year as Rosh
Hashanah fell on the first day of clas
ses.

New orientation week greets frosh

By Lori Richardson
Staff Reporter

 

The Freshmen began rolling into
‘*Big Lex’’ on Sunday and Monday of
Labor Day weekend. They faced a
week-long orientation that included
lectures, meetings, picnics, par-
ties and numerous introductions to fa-
culty members, upperclassmen, and
fellow freshmen. Orientation °88,
although it included the hectic sched-
ule, early hours, and exciting anticipa-
tion that is typical of the first week of

campus introduction, was indeed
different from Freshman orientation
of past years at W&L.

Pre-Orientation for minority and
international students added a new
dimension to this year’s welcoming
activities. Moving in prior to the rest
of the Class of °92, these students
were provided additional time to settle
in and adjust to campus living. Ac-
cording to Chelsea Porter of New Ha-
ven, Connecticut, Pre-Orientation
also allowed this select group to meet
more upperclassmen.

‘‘This is the year that Freshmen
could be Freshmen and not be rushees
during Orientation,’’ commented
Mary Alice McMorrow, Dorm Coun-
selor and one of three founders of a
committee to involve ‘students in the
planning of Freshman Orientation.
Fraternities exerted much less _in-
fluence on students participating in
Orientation this year than in recent
years. Freshmen, then, had time to get
settled before they had to begin mak-
ing social decisions that could have
great impact on their years at W&L.
Kara Cunningham, a Junior involved
in coordinating Orientation, feels that
Freshman class unity was enhanced
this year because the fraternity scene
did not further divide the women from
the men or the students looking at a
variety of different houses.

Described by one Freshman as
“‘taxing,’’ the week began with a wel-

come from President John Wilson to .

parents and to the Class of ‘92. Organ-
ized to provide a program with a daily
focus on either academics, the Honor
Code or increasing familiarity with
the University, the week proceeded
with a series of placement tests, lec-
tures, and a panel discussion.

The panel discussions concerning
the heritage of the university were the
most popular non-social event. The

panels were composed of students,

alumni and faculty in an informal set-
ting to speak with the Freshmen on to-

 

 

TALKBACK

 

 

 

men

pics that could not be discussed in
pamphlets or lectures. The panel dis-
cussions were also ‘‘brief,’’ a word
used rarely to describe Orientation
week meetings.

Parking permits and Student Tele-
phone Union fees were taken care of
early in the week when parents (and
their checkbooks) were still in town.

Despite the fact that many Fresh-
men felt that certain meetings were
redundant or even irrelevant, good
times were had at the Alumni Associa-
tion barbecue on Tuesday evening at
the Student Pavilion. Then at the Pavi-
lion party on Friday night the stu-
dents, had a chance to mingle with the
upperclassmen while hanging out to
the beat of ‘‘Locals Only.’’ Both
events sported a large turn-out. Ac-
cording to Wally Backdayan of Nat-
chitoches, LA, ‘‘outside of the long
walk, it was fun.’’ the Adopt-A-
Freshman picnic on the law school
field was also a success.

One potential party that never got
off the ground was the Mocktail Party
to be held on Wednesday night in
honor of the grand re-opening of the
General’s Headquarters. Confusion
resulting from the IFC changing con-
tact rules at the middle of the week
and behind schedule construction

work on the GHQ meant that less than
half of the Freshmen were aware that
the party was even scheduled.

Freshmen and Dorm Counselors
alike comment that Orientation week
was ‘‘too dragged out’’ and many as-
pects were ‘‘redundant.’’ Greg Dun-
ford, a Freshman from Fairfax, Va.
suggested that Orientation Week
should be reduced to two or three
days. Many changes and improve-
ments were made this year, though,
predominantly in providing a more
organized, more convenient schedule.
In addition, a concerted effort was
made to break down the class into
groups so as to reduce the size of the
meetings. A committee has been
formed to insure that student ideas are
taken into account when planning
Orientation week for next year. Acti-
vities such as the Student Activities
Fair and Luncheon were a big success
and turn-outs for the social events
were larger than in recent years. Ac-
cording to Mary Alice McMorrow,
Orientation is ‘‘not meant to be a rip
roaring time,’’ but the Freshmen were
able to get to know one another, talked
with many upperclassmen, and cer-
tainly became more familiar with the
rich tradition and atmosphere of
Washington and Lee.

cohol brought to the party by guests,
making certain not to serve anyone
who is obviously intoxicated or is get-
ting out of control. The fraternity
brothers are also responsible for
taking care of guests, including fe-
males from other colleges, who have
passed this point of intoxication and
making sure they are safe until morn-
ing.

‘*This is not Bourbon Street,’’ said
the Chief, commenting that several
girls from neighboring colleges were
literally afraid of the situation Satur-
day and were gathered around police
cars, requesting assistance and protec-
tion.

One fraternity president complained
about being awakened by a police
officer at eight o’clock Sunday morn-
ing and issued a citation for litter in
his house’s back yard. ‘‘This is har-

assment from my point of view,”’ he
said, contending that the litter was not
visible from any street. ‘‘It doesn’t
have to be visible,’’ countered Chief
Beard. ‘‘But it does have to be proper-
ly contained.’’ One By-Law of the
IFC Constitution states, in fact, that
there are to be five trash containers
near the entrance to the house.

The IFC delegates assured that they
would attempt to help the police in any
way they could, especially by making
sure that the IFC By-Laws were fol-
lowed. Chris Willard, secretary of the
council, read the ‘Guidelines for Safe
Partying’ from the By- Laws. The Ju-
dicial Board subsequently promised to
enforce these at the individual frater-
nities through the guidelines of rules
and punishments outlined in the Con
stitution.

‘The police are not in the mood [to
give us] a lot of breaks,’’ summed up
IFC President Ross Singletary.

Other main points of the meeting in
cluded a reminder for the house stan-
dards inspections and deadlines, a
passed motion that the fraternities be
arranged by alphabetical order in the
Rush Date Registration this Friday,
and a review of the rush calendar.

Polo downs Army
twice in Fall Classic

Generals to play best teams in East

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

Despite returning almost its entire roster from the year
before, Washington and Lee has a different water polo
team this year.

‘I don’t think it has to do with X’s and O’s,”’ said head
coach Page Remillard. ‘‘I think the significant adjustment
or change I see in this team is maturity.”’

The Generals showed the kind of composure their head
coach referred to when they twice beat Army, one of the
East’s best polo teams, and captured the W&L Fall Classic
title last weekend at Cy Twombly Pool. It was a case of the
veteran seniors on the team working in unison with a tal-
ent-laden freshman recruiting class.

“The seniors are doing an outstanding job of teaching
the freshmen,’’ said Remillard. ‘‘Our program has been
spared what happens to many programs that have a large
freshman class. We have been blessed with freshmen who
are very talented and yet extremely respectful of the tra-
dition they are inheriting. They are certainly respectful of
upperclassmen, and I’ve been impressed with them.’

What had to be impressive was the way the Generals,
ranked fifth by the East Coast Water Polo Coaches Asso-
ciation, handled the sixth-ranked Black Knights of Army
during the four-team round-robin tournament. In the first
game between the two schools, W&L jumped out to a 2-0
lead after the first period and never looked back. Senior
co-captain David Reavy scored three goals, while class-
mate Moose Herring chipped in two in leading the Gen-
erals to a 8-6 victory.

During the weekend, the Generals (6-0) also defeated
Dayton by scores of 15-4 and 17-9 and earned a couple of

Both W&L soccer teams start season on solid ground |

wins over Lynchburg, downing the Hornets 13-10 and
11-5. These wins set up the championship game and re-
match with Army on Sunday afternoon.

This time around the Generals found themselves down a
goal, 8-7, late in the fourth period. No reason to worry.
With three minutes remaining, senior Martin Burlingame
knotted the score at 8-8. The senior co-captain Dave Dietz
gave the Generals the lead with his second goal of the
match with 2:18 showing.

Army had a man-up situation but the General defense
held and W&L took over offensively and called a timeout
with 1:38 left. Holding onto a slim one-goal edge, it was
time for maturity and leadership to step to the forefront.

“In a one-goal game, anything can happen,”’ said Re-
millard, whose team won the Southern League tournament
last season. **So, we need a goal to make sure the game is
over. We weren't going to hold onto the ball, we were go-
ing to try to score.

‘So Dietz is floating on the water like an otter and just
kind of says, ‘Hey, we're seniors. We've been here for
four years. Let’s go out and get the job done.’ It’s not what
he said, but how he said it.’’

The Generals got the job done, with Dietz scoring his
third goal of the game to secure a 10-8 win. Army was shu-
tout the entire fourth quarter by a swarming W&L defense.

This weekend the Generals will have to turn it up a notch
higher as they travel to Annapolis, Md. for the Southeast
Varsity Invitational, a tournament featuring the best polo
teams in the East. W&L will play Iona in the first round in
a game that is a must win for Remillard. If the Generals
advance past the first round, they will finish no lower than
fourth in the tourney.

“If we win our first game, we are in for three tough,
tough games,”” said Remillard. ‘‘That’s exciting. We need
to win that first game.”’

From Staff Reports

 

The 1988 soccer season could be a
special one for Washington and Lee
head coach Rolf Piranian and his Gen-
erals, and five special people could be
the reason.

This will be the last season for five
standout Generals, seniors Mike Ve-
liuona and Steve Udicious, the 1988
captains, and their classmates Harry
Halpert, Johnny Sarber and Jamie
Urso. Piranian calls the group the
‘*backbone‘* of the team.

‘Although we lost some pretty nice
kids last season, we’ve got some tre-
mendous veterans coming back,”’ Pir-
anian said. ‘‘We’ve got a very special
class of five seniors, all of whom have
been impact players throughout their
careers. I'd like to see this very tal-
ented group finish in style.’’

The team certainly finished its
season opener last Saturday against
Denison in style, sneaking out of

Granville, Ohio with a 2-1 overtime
victory. The Generals trailed most of
the way against the Big Red, but W&L
freshman David Hooker scored late to
send the game into overtime. Urso
showed his senior leadership, connect-
ing for the gamewinner in the extra
period. Sophomore David Gilmore
and junior Rick Silva each had an as-
sist for the Generals.

The win was the first step toward a
successful season, something the five
seniors will assuredly strive to ac-
complish. Sarber, who has scored 15
goals in his W&L career, and Urso,
who was fourth on the team in scoring
last season, will lead W&L’s for-
wards. Gilmore and Silva also will be
keys to the attack up front.

Backing up the forward line is a tal-
ented and productive midfield led by
Veliuona, junior returning _ starter
Scott Levitt and classmate Patrick
Brown, who led the team in scoring
last season and is tied for W&L’s all-
time assist lead with 15 in his career.

Veterans Udicious and Halpert lead
the group at defense, which also in-
cludes sophomore Duke Dilliard and
junior Jeff Caggiano. W&L will be

strong in goal, as junior Jaek Pringle, |

who recorded four shutouts last
season returns. Pringle and sopho-
more Jon Bull combined for the win in
goal over Denison with, each player
making 10 and three saves respec-
tively.

“It’s certainly good to start the
season with a win,’’ Piranian said.
**But we have a lot of work to do this
week. I think having a full week to
work on correcting our mistakes will
help us a lot.’’

W&L will play its home-opener
Sunday against Johns Hopkins at 1:30
pm. The Generals begin their Old
Dominion Athletic Conference sched-
ule on Wednesday at Roanoke.

“*My goals for the team are to have
a winning season and win the
ODAC,”’ Piranian said. ‘‘I think a
10-win season is a realistic goal.”’

Women rebound with 7-0 win over R-MWC

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

Last year was a learning experience
for the Washington and Lee women’s
soccer team.

Playing its first season of varsity
competition, the Generals went 2-8-3
and finished fifth in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference. More important
than the wins and losses, however,
was the opportunity for the team to
become accustomed to game condi-
tions and pressure situations.

That experience, especially from
the seniors who have been with the
program since it started out as a de-
velopmental team four years ago, has
definitely carried over into this year’s
campaign. After a tough 8-1 opening
game loss to an overpowering Den-
ison squad, the Generals rebounded
nicely with a 7-0 thrashing of Ran-
dolph-Macon Women’s College yes-
terday in Lexington.

“‘[The seniors] are very mature and
they are excellent leaders,’ said head

coach Jan Hathorn. ‘‘I think that’s
why we are so cohesive as a team. We
have a lot of fun because of it. They
certainly make my job easy, because
they are so capable, dependable, re-
liable and hard working. This is an ex-
tremely hard working group.”’

The Generals’ hard work was. not
enough to stop an excellent Denison
team on Saturday. W&L was able to
score only one goal, which came from
junior Catherine Baillio, last year’s
leading scorer.

The offense did not remain silent
against R-MWC. The Generals found
the back of the net four times in the
first ten minutes of play with Baillio
scoring twice and freshmen Ashley
Gray and Ann Shaughnessy adding a
goal apiece. Halftime score: W&L 4,
R-MWC 0.

“‘Every freshman is contributing,’’
said Hathorn. ‘‘Everyone of them is a
player. Everyone of them has experi-
ence.’’

The second half had been a trouble-
some one for the Generals a year ago,

Opening day is ugly |

,

something Hathorn attributed to as ‘a
lack of mental toughness and not as a
problem of conditioning. These prob-
lems were not present yesterday as
W&L continued to control the action
and keep the ball on R-MWC’s side of
the field. Freshman Elise Bryant,
senior Stephanie Lake and Shaughne-
ssy (her second goal of the afternoon)
scored for the Generals in the second
half. Hathorn sees the play of the
freshman as the cure to the second-
half blues. ’

**T think it will be better because the
freshman, first of all, are so strong,”’
she said. ‘‘I think it will make people
work, because if they don’t do it they
are going to be replaced.’’ :

The team will play host to the de-
fending ODAC champions in Roanoke
College on Saturday at 2:00 pm before
traveling to Ashland to play Ran-
dolph-Macon on Tuesday. Roanoke is
ranked No. 6 in the region in Division
ILI in the preseason. fC

“It’s going to be like playing a Det-
ison team again,’’ said Hathorn.

for Generals’ gridiron

W&L football’s opening-day dol-
drums continue.

Since 1955, the Generals are 11-22
in season openers. Since 1977, when
head coach Gary Fallon came to Lex-
ington, W&L is 3-8 in game one. And
the Generals haven’t won their season
opener since 1984,

But the Generals’ general lack of

success On opening day in recent years
may have more to do with the oppo-

nent — Emory & Henry six out of

seven times since 1982 — than the
calendar. In fact, Fallon jokingly
blames his poor record in season-
openers on W&L Athletic Director
and chief schedule-maker William
McHenry.

Whatever the reason, the streak
continued Saturday afternoon, when
Emory & Henry pounded the Generals
41-12 before a crowd of 3,300 at
W&L’s inaugural Hall of Fame game.

Things went well for Fallon early
on. W&L received the opening kick
off and drove 59 yards in 10 plays, in
cluding a 19-yard pass from junior
quarterback Phillip Sampson to soph
omore slotback Carl Gilbert and an
18-yard pass from Sampson to senior
split end Keith Boyd.

But all the air went out of the W&L
blimp when a Sampson handoff fell

into Emory & Henry hands. }Even
though the Wasps returned the favor
just three plays later with a fumble of
their own, W&L was stymied and for-
ced to settle for a 37-yard Carter
Quayle field goal. =

At the end of the first quarter, W&L
held a tenuous 3-0 lead, a lead that
would vanish two plays into the sec-
ond period when Emory & Henry tajl-
back Scotty Verran dove into the end
zone from a yard out. Kicker Morty
Guy added the extra point that put the
Wasps up 7-3. i

| ’

After three plays, W&L seniof Tom
Skeen came on to punt, and the Wasps
scored three plays later on a 61-yard
pass play. E&H backup QB Pat Walk-
er found split end Jon Lakey for’ a
61-yard gain and a 14-3 lead. .

W&L drove to the E&H 20, where
sophomore tailback Mason Pope was
caught for a 6-yard loss on. third
down. Quayle’s second field goal of
the day, a booming 42-yarder, made
the score 14-6. »

The Generals were heavily du-
tweighed by the Wasps on both frqnt
lines, and the Emory & Henry size
advantage became apparent on the
next drive. E&H drove 73 yards in gen
plays and scored on a l-yard run by
tailback Rodney Beville to take’ a
commanding 21-6 lead at halftime. ,

MIKE SHADY

After the Olympics,
money talks

Let’s play a game of word association. I'll give you a certain word
and you respond with the first word that comes to mind. Ready?

money—cash
cash—W&L
W&L—conservative
conservative—Bush
Bush—beer
beer—AMiller Lite
Miller Lite—athletes
athletes—Olympics
Olympics—money

Yes, the Olympics are cranking up this weekend and that means
money—big bucks, no whammies—for several of those Americans in-
volved in the activities.

Wait a minute! I thought the Olympics are for amateurs only. What’s
all this talk about money?

Well, it’s not like the athletes will be competing for cash directly, but,
in most sports, an individual’s performance could indirectly lead to fu-
ture dividends. We're talking endorsements. Major endorsements.
Bruce (Wheaties) Jenner does not have to pick up a pinkie for the rest of
his natural life because of the way he marketed himself after winning the
decathlon gold in Montreal. Neither does Mary Lou Retton.

Other winners will use their Olympic experience to launch profes-
sional careers. While track and field athletes are already professionals,
others like boxers, gymnasts, basketball, baseball and volleyball players
as well as the equestrian riders will turn Olympic gold into a chance to
earn lots of green. In boxing, for instance, a gold medal can mean six
figures in prize moolah for their first professional fight. Being on the
Olympic basketball team assures a signing bonus of at least $500,000 on
a NBA club.

Enough, you say! Bring back the ‘‘good old days’’ when men were
men and athletes competed because they loved competing. Why did it
change?

I don’t think it has changed. We get so caught up in this romantic idea
that athletes should be strong of body and pure of mind. If the opportun-
ity presents itself, why can’t an athlete take advantage of it? What’s
he/she supposed to do? Refuse the money?

For most of the individuals at Seoul, the games will be the realization
of the athletic dream. For others, it will be the realization of a financial
dream, as well.

NOTES —Once again my fall is ruined by the New York Mets. Has
there ever been a team, besides the Boston Celtics, that is just universal-
ly hated except by those who live in the New York area? It won’t matter
anyway. Look for the Oakland A’s to beat the ‘“‘Oughta be’s’’ in six
games in the Series... Hats off to the W&L water polo team. This team
has a chance to become the first ever Division II squad to make the
NCAA water polo championships..... Finally, a warm welcome goes
out to our new Sports Information Director Mike (Sid) Stachura. I’m
sure Stach will do an excellent job and it is great to be working with such

In a lot of ways, the 1988 Washing-
ton and Lee women’s volleyball team
looks like a first-year sport. For in-
stance, this season will be W&L’s
first season to compete for the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference cham-
pionship in volleyball. The season will
be filled with plenty of firsts for the
record books, as well.

But all those first-year sport looks
can be deceiving. At least, that’s what
head coach Susan Dittman hopes.

The women will enter their first
ODAC season as almost everything
but inexperienced. Two years of toil-
ing away in relative obscurity as a de-

“I’m really encouraged about how
the year looks,’’ said Dittman, who
has guided the team for the past two
years as a developmental sport. ‘‘I
think we’ ll be able to stay on the court
with everybody and hold our own pre-
tty well. I think we have come a long
ways in two years.”’

 

Opener

 

(Continued from page 6

The third quarter saw E&H use its
size advantage and a powerful running
game to build a 35-6 lead. After an
exchange of punts, Emory & Henry’s
Verran went to work and picked up 37
yards on seven carries, including a
3-yard touchdown run that Gave the
Wasps a 28-6 lead.

W&L had the ball for only one play
before junior fullback Russell Crosby
fumbled at his own 28. Six plays later,
the Wasps were in the end zone and
completely in command, 35-6.

Both teams emptied their benches in
the fourth quarter, and the play of
W&L’s backups was one of the after-
noon’s few bright spots for the Gen-
erals.

velopmental sport have paid dividends
that could be cashed in as soon as this
season.

**At the bare minimum, I would like
to see us make the ODAC tourna-
ment,’’ said Dittman of the season-
ending conference tourney, for which
the top eight ODAC teams qualify.
‘*The team has set a personal goal of
finishing at least slightly above .500,
as well.

**And I think we can do it if we
work hard and the team gels.’’

Many positives point to the squad
doing just that. In addition to having
everyone return from last year’s
group, a fine crop of freshmen should
contribute, also, Dittman said. Of the
returning upperclassmen, three key
players will be seniors Vanessa Hart-
man and Melissa Thrasher, who were
co-captains last year, and sophomore
Melissa Jay, who quarterbacks the
W&L attack and was named the
team’s most valuable player last
season.

The team should feature a healthy
mix of seniors and experienced

“I was really pleased with their en-
thusiasm and hustle,’’ said Fallon.
‘*When they were in there, they were
giving their best.’’

Junior quarterback Chris Smythe
scored the Generals’ only touchdown
of the game after leading a 57-yard
drive that included impressive running
by sophomore fullback Kirk Sohon-
age.

HASHMARKS— Sampson fin-
ished with 8-of-14 passing for 119
yards and one interception. Smythe
completed five of six passes for 61
yards and also rushed for 18 yards on
four carries.... W&L receiving: Boyd
caught five passes for 70 yards, Pope
four for 53 yards.... Crosby carried
10 times for 51 yards, and Sohonage
rushed five times for 32 yards.... The
Generals take a week off before
traveling to Centre College on Sept.
24.

Women’s volleyball set for first varsity year

younger players, Dittman said.

‘*The seniors are in the unique posi-
tion of this being their first and last
season, so they will be the ones push-
ing the others and keeping the inten-
sity up,’” she said.

Dittman is encouraged by last win-
ter’s scrimmages, which saw W&L go
4-3 against conference opponents.
More of the same success could be in
store this fall. The Generals opened
their season Tuesday night with
scrimmages against Eastern Mennon-

ite and Bridgewater. The season gets
into full swing with the Randolph
Macon Woman’s College Tournament
this weekend.

“I expect we'll be competitive and
play good power volleyball,’’ said
Dittman. ‘‘We have some people who
can do a lot of things and that has
opened up a lot of options. Now, it’s a
matter of figuring out how to use them
and getting them on court in the right
places. I think we can be real success
ful.””

‘88 Summer Hot for movies

 

By Michael Tuggle

Entertainment Editor

 

Well, I must say that this summer
was exemplary for good movies. In
fact, it was the best summer for films
since E.T. and company hit the sum-
mer scene in 1982. As always, there
was a plethora of sequels, the majority
of which were incredibly poor, but for
the most part the summer was excel-
lent for good films and high ticket
sales

Many of the heralded films released
toward the end of the summer such as
‘*Married to the Mob,”’ ‘‘Running on
Empty,’’ ‘Eight Men Out’’ and
‘*Midnight Run"’ are not included in
the following analysis of my Top Ten
Summer Movies because I never got a
chance to see them. However, having
seen the majority of the worthwhile
films for summer 1988, here are my
choices for the Top Ten films of the
summer.

10. The Presidio

Good cops and robbers flick. Nice
to see people still smuggle things like
diamonds instead of only drugs. Good
plot and tie together at the end. A little
predictable but not a bad flick. Sean
Connery is wonderful as always and
Meg Ryan is hotter than ever.

Tug’s Tag - * * * (out of five)

9. Crocodile Dundee II

At least as good as the first if not
better. Again there are priceless
scenes such as the snake killing in the
department store, and the scene with
Dundee’s aborigine friends. ‘‘Do we
really get to eat them?’’is priceless.
Hogan is still just as refreshing in the
lead as he was when he first began the
role a few years ago. The end is a little
predictable but it doesn’t hurt this
film; the one sequel that delivered this
summer.

8. Young Guns

The film is very well done cinema-
tically and is perfectly cast but does
tend to drag a little in places. Its nice

to see a decent western for a change
but don’t count on this film bringing
the western back as a_ substantial
genre. The strength of this film lies
not with its subject matter but with its
young stars. Charlie Sheen, Emilio
Estevez and Casey Siemaszko are
adequate but it is Kieffer Sutherland,
Dermot Mulroney and Lou Diamond
Phillips who steal the show. Phillips
scene describing the slaughter of his
reservation is especially powerful.

7. Cocktail

I’m going against the critics on this
one. I thought the film was quite en-
joyable and that the performances
were excellent. Tom Cruise continues
to improve with each film as does El-
isabeth Shue. Bryan Brown gives the
best performance he’s given since
‘‘Breaker Morant.’’ Think about the
film in terms of the cliche *‘Money
isn’t everything’? and you may find
that the film says more than you
thought it did.

6. Bull Durham

The beginning drags and the end
races but overall this is an excellent
character study. It’s not bust out
funny, but it is quite humorous in all
the right places. Good character de-
velopment is really what the film is all
about. While the film is all right, the
three main characters are fantastic.
Costner’s ‘‘I believe in the small of a
woman's back, the hanging curveball,
high fiber, good scotch, long fore-
play, that there ought to be a constitu-
tional amendment outlawing astro-turf
and the designated hitter, the ‘‘sweet
spot‘t, chocolate chip cookies and
long, slow, soft, deep, wet kisses that
last three days’’ line is a classic.

5. Coming to America

Cute story and great versatile acting
from Arsenio Hall and Eddie Murphy
to make the film work. Great tie in to
‘*Trading Places’’ with Don Ameche
and Ralph Bellamy. Murphy’s charac-
terizations of the men in the barber

4. A Fish Called Wanda

If you don’t enjoy Monty Python
and/or can’t appreciate the dry wit of
British humor then going to see this
film would be a waste of your time
and money. However, those of you
with open minds should find this film
utterly hilarious. John Cleese and Mi-
chael Palin, the braintrusts of Britain’s
Monty Python, are again together and
are funnier than ever. The film is per-
fectly cast with Jamie Lee Curtis and
Kevin Kline in the other leads and is
acted beautifully. This is definitely a
film you will want to see again.

3. Big

Definitely one of the best movies of
the summer. Even though the film
dragged a touch in places, overall it
was done very well. The scenes in
FAO Schwartz were wonderful. Tom
Hanks is incredible as the 13-year-old
and again shows us what absolute bril-
liance his talent holds. He has every-
thing about a 13-year- old down to a
T. After so many failures using the
same premise, it is refreshing and sat-
isfying to know that there is a director
out there who can make this film and
not screw it up. Bravo, Penny Mar-
shall.

summer. (At least the guys are asking
that.) The reason is, because ‘‘Die
Hard’’ a great flick. It’s no major
cinematic achievement or anything.
It’s just highly entertaining. Willis is
not in my opinion a comic genius or a
fantastic actor. However, if he can
stick to roles such as the one he plays
in this off to the races, never ending
cops and terrorists film, then he has a
place to work in Hollywood. This film
takes off and never slows down. The
acting is quite good as are the special
effects. If you missed this film, go
back and find it.

1. Who Framed Roger Rabbit?
Definitely lives up to all the hype its
been getting as the best film of the
summer and one of the best of the
year. The combination of the live ac-
tion with the animation is absolutely
incredible and has never had an equal.
This film will win the 1989 Academy
Award for Visual Effects hands down.
Hoskins is perfect having to act his en-
tire part off of nothing but air. Watch
for him to be nominated for Best
Actor when the Academy Award
nominations are announced in March.
Bringing the Warner Bros. and Disney
cartoons together for the first time is
definitely a coup. All the major char-
acters from both studios appear in the
film with the exceptions of Felix the
Cat and Popeye whose owners
wouldn’t accept the $5000 rental from
the director. That in itself is worth
some type of award. The film is won-
derful from the superb opening scene
up until the final one. See this film
more than once and watch and listen
for little things. You'll pick up some-

thing new each time you see it.

Heated debate swells over the new-
dly-formed Confidential Review
Committee as to whether the commit-
‘tee usurps student power on campus.
<The CRC had its first meeting Tues-
day night.

The CRC, composed of four faculty
members and three students, met to
develop a set of policies and proce-
dures that will be effective in dealing
With cases of sexual, racial or reli-
gious slurs and sexual harassment.

* The CRC was formed by a faculty
yote last spring after an ad hoc review
committee decided that there was not a
sufficient outlet for complaints of es-

ially sensitive subject matter.
enny Bray, a Co-head Dorm Counse-
lor who served on the ad hoc review
committee, said the campus needed to
pay ‘“‘increased attention to the fact
that students with these types of con-
cerns felt unable to approach the Stu-
dent Conduct Committee,’ which
formerly had jurisdiction over these
matters.

“SCC Chairmen David Burns and
Wade Fricke voiced their opposition
to the CRC at an EC meeting last
Monday night. Fricke believes that the
=SCC has lost ‘‘one of their most im-
portant roles.’’ Burns said last year’s
SCC president, Mike Henry, “‘gave
the opinion that the SCC did not feel
comfortable with those kinds of
eases.’’ But, Burns added, Henry con-
sulted neither the SCC in full, nor in-
dividual members about this view-
point.

+ Senior Greg Dale said at the EC
meeting that the CRC takes away
power from the student body, since
the CRC has a majority of faculty
members. Burns concurred with this
Viewpoint, saying, ‘‘I think the stu-
dents can handle it.”’

+ However, last year the SCC heard
only two cases of sexual harassment.
Fourteen other cases of sexual har-
assment were heard by Dean Anece F.
McCloud, Associate Dean of Minor-

       

 

   

ity Students and International Affairs.
Professor Samuel J. Kozak, head of
the CRC and head of the ad hoc re-
view committee said, ‘‘The students
(on the review committee) decided
there was a lacking in the way to
handle sexual, racial and religious
slurs.’

Kozak wants to see the CRC be-
come a ‘‘vehicle (for) sensitive issues
that require confidence, that will en-
courage people to come forward so
that their problems can be recog-
nized.””

Burns would like to see the SCC
strive for higher levels of confidentia-

issues in mind, Kozak said. The CRC
has four faculty members to eliminate
situations where students ‘‘are reluc-
tant to go before a committee of their
peers,”’ Kozak said.

The four faculty members who are
on the CRC are Kozak of the Geology
Department, Steven Hobbs of the law
school, Ann Rogers, a Japanese
professor and Barbara Brown, the
University Librarian, The three stu-
dent members are Kathryn Kirmayer,
a law student, Amy Smith, a senior,
and James Rambo, a sophomore.

The CRC membes were selected

‘*... the SCC did not feel comfortable with
those kinds of cases.’’

--David Burns

 

lity. The SCC is composed of 13
members, which Burns admitted can
cause problems in protecting high
levels of confidentiality because of the
number of people involved.

Both Burns and Fricke suggested
several options for the SCC to con-
sider in order to maintain jurisdiction
over sexual complaints. ‘‘A smaller
board of the SCC could deal with
these matters, or we could work with
confidentiality regulations,’’ Burns
said. The SCC has no stipulations for
confidentiality similar to the Section O
of the EC handbook, which requires
that members of the EC say nothing
about honor investigations, Fricke
noted at the EC meeting.

“‘If (the ad hoc review committee)
had come to us and approached us
with problems we could have worked
on it together. We were told (by
Henry) that there was nothing we
could. do about it,’’ Burns said, who
wants to see the jurisdiction of sexual
and ethnic harassments return to the
SCC.

But the CRC was formulated speci-
fically with confidentiality to sensitive

 

about two weeks ago by President
John Wilson, EC President Christo-
pher DeMovellan said.

There are four women and two
blacks on the committee, Kozak said,
who stressed that the committee was
designed to equally represent all fac-
tions of the university. ‘‘I think people
have been chosen who can be objec-
tive and sensitive about the situations.
I personally don’t have a particular
principle that I want to espouse other
than justice.’’

Kozak added that he would like to
see the CRC act as a “‘last-resort
committee,’’ that would take cases
only if it were decided that counseling
or similar steps of action had proved
ineffective.

The CRC will not serve as a coun-
seling organization. One of the few
provisions that was given to the CRC
is that no one involved in the counsel-

ing process in the university may be a ~

member of the CRC. This prohibits
dorm counselors, resident assistants,
University Psychologist Dr. James
Worth and all other university coun-
seling staff from tn on ate commit-

*a

CRC: Debate continues

tee, Bray said. The point of the com-
mittee is only to allow for confidential
communications about sensitive sub-
jects, Bray said at the EC meeting.

David Burns countered the state-
ment saying that he ‘‘would hate to
see a lack of confidentiality and sen-
sitivity in the recent past as the only
points that take some power away
from the student-run campus.’’

Senior John Roach spoke out at the
EC meeting, calling the formation of
the CRC ‘‘One of the worst things that
has happened at W&L since I’ve been
here.’’ Roach said, ‘‘This committee
will stop being a committee of last re-
sorts, and turn into a law review.”’

Roach said that the unchecked facul-
ty power will lead to problems.
“‘When you give a committee ‘carte
blanche’ to move and investigate on
these things, you’re asking for
trouble,’’ he said. He added that ‘‘a
few swear words,’’ which are listed
under the law as sexual denigration,
can lead to a great deal more problems
than they mean at the time they are ut-
tered.’’ In closing, he said, ‘‘The stu-
dent control issue is of grave con-

.

cem.

The EC moved to form a small
committee to look into the options for
the CRC, including complete dissolu-
tion of the committee, or leaving the
committee as it is. EC members Dan
DuPre and John Fialcowitz will meet
with the SCC and members of the
CRC to consider alternatives.

A possibility that was mentioned at
the EC meeting was to change the
formation of the CRC to a student
majority. Kozak said that the CRC
was formed with a faculty majority to
maintain continuity and solidity within
the committee. Faculty members
would be relatively permanent mem-
bers of the CRC, and would be a solid
foundation, while students would
change each year. Kozak said he plans
to leave the CRC after the first year.

Currently, the CRC has no specitic
procedures, but will be able to issue
punishments from counseling to sus-
pension, Kozak said.

The EC committee will report its

findings at the next regular EC meet-
ing on Monday, Sept. 26.

Executive Committee:
budget hearings near

By Stacy L. Morrison
Staff Reporter

 

" After hearing a lengthy debate on
the newly formed Confidential Re-
view Committee (CRC), the Execu-
tive Committee announced the date
for budget hearings.

EC budget hearings will be held
Tuesday, Sept. 27, at 5:45. Approxi-
mately 25 campus organizations, from
Ariel to Trident, will present their
fequests for EC funding. Budget
request applications are due Monday,
Sept. 26, by noon.

’ Petitions for first-year law students
interested running for the EC
Monday

were

due Seven petitions were

received. Candidates are: Paul Dris-
coll, Josh VanHulst, Kerry D. Lee,
Mark A.Cobb, Rick Sorenson, Jimmy
Watts and Tom O’Brien. Also the
Dean of Students has requested that a
law student be appointed to the Stu-
dent Health Committee this year. The
Student Health Committee was for-
merly composed of faculty members
and three undergraduate students.
Senior Greg Dale withdrew his
request for EC funds for a student
voter registration drive. Dale had
planned to print up cards with the
telephone number of each  state’s
Board of Elections so students could
contact their election board to register
and/or request an absentee ballot

Dale withdrew his request because the
Ring-tum Phi agreed to publish the
phone numbers.

DeMovellan said that ‘‘after a great
deal of research,’’ the EC decided to
allocate a maximum of $4,000 toward
the purchase of new equipment of the
EC’s use. The EC will replace its pho-
tocopier and buy a new computer. The
Xerox 1012 copier will cost approxi-
mately $1,610; the Epson computer
and printer, $1,750. The EC voted
unanimously to purchase the above
equipment, which will be used to store
and process EC records, agendas-and
minutes,

All members were present and the
meeting lasted about two hours.

Charles F. Phillips Jr., Robert G.
Brown Professor of Economics at
Washington and Lee University, re-
cently published the second edition of
his textbook, The Regulation of Public
Utilities: Theory and Practice.

The first edition of The Regulation
of Public Utilities was published in
1984 and has served as a preferred
guide to public utilities in the Ameri-
can economy both as a classroom
textbook and as a reference work for
utility executives and regulators. The
book is also used extensively by law
firms, Phillips said.

In the second edition, Phillips re-
views and analyzes the development
of economic regulation, emphasizing
recent and future issues confronting
the public utility sector. The highly
acclaimed text also contains an up-
dated index of all of the significant
commission rulings and court de-
cisions regarding public utlities.

The idea for the book, according to
Phillips, grew out of the need for such
a text in his Economics 314 course,
Regulated Industries in the American
Economy.

Phillips said he was also influenced
by a course he teaches every summer
at the University of Michigan.

**It’s called the Public Utilities Exe-
cutive Program and it’s a four-week
course for middle managers,’’ Phillips
said,

Phillips has taught the course since
1970 and is a faculty member of that
program.

Phillips is a nationally known au-
thority in the field of government re-
gulated businesses and has testified as
an expert witness before federal agen-
cies and regulatory commissions. He
joined the Washington and Lee faculty
in 1959 and was named to the Brown
Professorship in 1980.

Phillips holds a bachelor’s degree
from the University of New Hamp
shire and a doctorate from Harvard.

Campus security guards and Lexington policemen writing parking tick-
ets have been a familiar sight since students have returned to school.

Tickets increase;
Parking decreases

 

By Nancy K. Whalen
Tri-editor

Washington and Lee on-campus
parking leaves somthing to be de-
sired... an available space.

According to Charles F. ‘‘Murph’’
Murray, director of security, the
school has issued 1,560 parking stick-
ers this year to faculty, staff and stu-
dents who will be parking on campus
during class hours. He also said that
his most recent count of W&L desig-
nated parking spaces was 1,051.
However, he concluded that that count
was before construction began on the
Performing Arts Center and Gaines
Hall, which took out three parking
areas.

Of the stickers issued according to
Murph, approximately 600 were is-
sued to faculty and staff, 374 to up-
perclass students living outside a one-
half mile radius of Washington Hall or
residential members of designated
fraternities, 274 to law students, 98 to
freshmen, 96 to residents of Woods
Creek, 91 to residents of Gaines Hall,
and 27 to dorm counselors. A $20 fee
was required from everyone register-
ing a car as listed above, with the ex-
ception of faculty and staff, and dorm
counselors.

There were also 274 stickers issued
to students living inside the one-half
mile radius of Washington Hall not

wanting to use campus parking.

Although the number of available
parking spaces has decreased, Murph
said the numbers of towings and tick-
ets given have increased in the past
few years.

Murph said stricter enforcement
came about at the request of Frank A.
Parsons, executive assistant to the
president, for one reason because the
grass in the corral or ‘‘snake pit’’ as
Murph called it, has become torn up.
He said W&L security guard Thomas
Bane’s primary job is to enforce the
parking regulations.

Adding to the problem, according to
Murph, is the use of W&L parking
during business hours, by some Lex-
ington business owners. He said at
least four business owners’ cars have
been towed from the corral this year.

He said the main problem is that
‘*no one wants to walk.’’ He said the
majority of the cars towed belong to
freshmen because they are breaking a
parking agreement they signed requir-
ing them to park out by Liberty Hall.

Murph said he has made some sug-
gestions to alleviate the parking prob-
lem, but as of yet, no plans have been
adopted. ‘‘It’s a problem,’’ he said,
**...it’s a problem.

IFC reports good rush

No serious problems arise

By Clint Wheelock
Staff Reporter

Interfraternity Council delegates at
Tuesday’s meeting were pleased to
learn good news about Rush in general
as well as good reports on last week-
end’s invitation parties.

Thus far, no freshmen have been
hospitalized or taken to the infirmary
due to overuse of alcohol, a relief

after considering that such instances
have been on a steady rise in the past
several years’ Rush activities.

Also, no serious problems were re-
ported regarding fraternity functions
during the weekend of Sept. 16-18.
Police remained on top of the situa-
tion, particularly as pertained to Sat-

urday’s invitation parties. Bands were
shut down shortly after midnight,
when the amplified noise permits offi-
cially ran out. Several houses,
however, have received citations for

unauthorized amplified sound during
the week — technically, permits are
only issued for Friday and Saturday
nights.

Reminders of the schedule for the
remaining days of Rush and the fol
lowing weeks were also given includ-
ing information on post-pledging acti-
vities as well as deferred Rush. A

period of no contact for non- pledges
will resume on Sunday evening for
most students and on Monday evening
for currently-active varsity athletes. If
a rushee has not pledged by this time,
he must wait until Oct. 7, when full

- considered ‘‘social members”’

contact resumes. This limitation will
not be placed on pledges, who are
of the
fraternity. ‘‘Cooling-off periods’’ will
also be enforced in the next few days,
including all day Thursday and Friday
between the Ist Rush Date and the be-

ginning of parties. The Judicial Board
commented that it consider s
breaching of these rules to be ‘one of
the biggest violations.’” Warnings

were also given regarding the proper
facilitation of Tear Night, which is
Friday, Sept. 23, and the pledge
ceremonies. Also, fraternities were
reminded that Saturday afternoon was
to be a period of ‘‘informal drop-ins at
the house only.’’ Delegates were also

reminded of the necessity in getting
their pledges to the 7:00 assembly at
Lee Chapel this coming Monday.

A proposal outlining a recycling
plan for the Lexington community
was presented by Professor Emmons
of the Biology Department. Through
the plan, the fraternities would vol-
unteer their time to support a center of

the collecting of recyclable glass
paper, aluminum, and other metals.
The center would be operated three

days a week for about eight hours a
day with the aid of fraternity vol-
unteers as an ongoing community ser-
vice project

At the close of the meeting, dele-
gates were reminded to use caution in
this weekend’s pledging activities so
that the past weekend’s good model
would be rem ad.

The United States is plagued with citizens who continue to ex-
periment with devastating drugs like cough medicine and Elmer’s
Glue. Every single day, a well known athlete or computer analyst is
admitted to the Betty Ford Clinic for Famous Drug Abusers. Moti-
vated by First Lady drug expert Nancy Reagan, the Senate is plan-
ning to change the drinking age to 35.

In the middle of this drug controversy is the city of Lexington,
Virginia. The city which was once famous for the grave of General
Lee and his esteemed horse is now earning a reputation as a leader
in underage drinking convictions. The city recently won a Supreme
Court decision against a student who was found eating a chili-
cheese dog at 3 a.m. and arrested for public drunkenness. The ar-
resting officer correctly realized that he had enough probable cause
for a conviction. Lexington Police statistics for the 1988 year have
recently been released to the general public. The total number of
felony arests is second only to Detroit. Here are the exact figures: 0
felony arrests; 0 homicide arrests; 15,000 public drunkenness
arrests 32,000 underage drinking arrests.

In addition, Lexington issued 3 million speeding tickets, 14 mil-
lion parking tickets, and collected $600,000 worth of fines for noise

violations.

The W&L administration supports Lexington’s crackdown on
drugs, alcohol and noise and is doing its part to conform to the city.
To help in the ‘‘just say no to drugs’’ campaign, the University has
increased penalties for substance offenders. The students learned
about this general crackdown from a very well- written university
presidential letter they received this summer.

The position of colleges concerning drugs has changed drastically
in 20 years. It used to be that students went to college in order to
take drugs with administrators and professors. In 1968, a mere 20
years ago, the university president also sent home letters about
drugs to students. I obtained one of these letters for reprinting. Here

it is:

Dear students, The recent South American drought has ruined
their marijuana crop and market prices have escalated. Because the
administration is sensitive to the portion of the student body that
uses this drug, we will help those in need by subsidizing the impor-
tation of a very potent crop from the African nation of Morocco.

Peace brother,
Norman Groovis

Because I hope to someday win journalistic awards for important
commentary against drugs, I will take this opportunity to remind
students that they could die from the abuse of drugs, like arsenic.

MY VIEW
By Robert J. Owen

 

On Tuesday, Sept. 13th, Chief
Beard informed the IFC that the past
weekend’s activities had left Lexing-
ton a ‘‘town out of control.’’ Of the 48
arrests made Saturday night, the vast
majority had been W&L students. In
addition to reminding the fraternities,
Beard also left a warning, ‘“We cannot
continue the way that we are going.”’
These words very accurately reflect
the current situation.

Comments by several students in
last week’s paper demonstrate that
many students may have missed the
point of Beard’s message. But we all
saw that he means business this past
weekend as the police moved to en-
force the law during last Saturday’s
Rush activities.

Some students may feel that Beard’s
actions constitute police harassment.
Others may feel that the administra-
tion is supposed to protect our right to
drink and party. Many more seem to
feel that W&L has no right to interfere
in a student’s private partying when it
is not a school function. Unfortun-
ately, these are not valid assumptions.

Those of you who feel that the
events of the past few weeks have

been police harassment may wish to
consider the following points.

Beard himself reminded the IFC of
the need for fraternities to obtain per-
mits before holding a weekend party.
Imagine the consequences if Beard
withheld permits for parties on Home-
coming, Alumni Weekend, Hal-
loween, Christmas and FANCY
DRESS. It’s even easier to shut down
week night parties. IFC by-laws
clearly state that music and general
noise levels should ‘‘never exceed the
noise ordinance requirements of Lex-
ington.’’ Now consider that it is the
city and police of Lexington who set
and enforce these standards. In short,
Chief Beard has been very reasonable
so far.

As for those students who feel that
the administration is not standing up
for our rights at W&L, consider this
for a moment. There is no written
rule, law or statute that gives us the
right to drink as W&L students. Parti-
cularly since probably 80 percent of
this campus is under the legal drinking
age of 21.

Finally, I respectfully remind the
students who feel that the administra-
tion has no right to interfere in our
non-academic social events that we
are ,. &L students. Because we live in
this community our actions reflect
upon us and our university. Thus the
administration does have a vested in-
terest in what we do. The old argu-

The dangerous direction of French politics —

 

MY VIEW
By Julia Kirk

 

The first time I talked with a mem-
ber of Le Front National I was told
that the leader of the movement, Jean
Marie Le Pen, was a Francist not a
fascist and that being a racist was
something of which to be proud. This
was but a few weeks after Le Pen had
stated publicly that the Holocaust was
a ‘detaile’ (detail). Even now it seems
impossible to me that intelligent edu-
cated people support the Front (FN)
and Le Pen. They do. In the first
round of Presidential elections Le Pen

drugs

ment of ‘‘boys will be boys’’ does not
work anymore. Nor does ‘‘I’m not re-
sponsible, I was drunk.’’ We are not
‘‘boys”’ or ‘‘girls’’ but ADULTS and
as such we are RESPONSIBLE FOR
OUR ACTIONS.

What do we do about this situation?
The answer is simple. The IFC needs
to take the initiative in policing and
supervising the fraternity system. No
matter how painful, the IFC must be
firm and the penalties more than a slap
on the wrist. This is infinitely more
preferable to the possible and proba-
bly future actions of Chief Beard. In-
deed, such a move by the IFC would
remove the necessity of action on
Beard’s part. Finally, this will return a
measure of independence to the IFC
which it has lost in recent years.

The future of parties at W&L lies in
the hands of the student body. Please,
let’s not blow the chance.

beat Mitterand in such key cities as
Marseilles and Nice.

The ever increasing popularity of
the far right in France is worrisome.
In 1981 the movement won only 1
percent of the vote and in 1988 — 14.4
percent. New FN voters are former
moderates, socialists and most espe-
cially former communists. Le Pen’s
nationalistic rhetoric and cries of
‘France for the French’ have created a
strong voter base 50 percent of which
stated that they voted for Le Pen
solely on the basis of his political pro-

On the surface, Le Pen’s program
does not seem terribly frightening. He
supports the death penalty, wishes to
battle drug use and violence, and

wants immigration and naturalization
laws rewritten. Given his virulent ra-
cism the last point would have a stag-
gering effect on the Arab population
in France. However, the most disturb-
ing part of his program is La Pref-
erence Francaise, a policy aimed at
helping French workers who have suf-
fered from competition by ‘foreign’
workers in the country.

France is the fourth largest in-
dustrial economy in the world, yet for
five weeks every year it grinds to a
halt while the population goes on va-
cation. One would be hard-pressed to
find a Frenchman willing to give up
his paid ‘vacances’ or admit that clos-

sound. It is much easier to blame the
most highly visible minority, the
Arabs, for all the country’s problems. ,
Le Pen has had incredible success in
doing just that, and his popularity con-»
tinues to grow.

It is easily conceivable that the,
Front National might grow to encom-
pass up to 20 percent of the voting po-’
pulation. Under the French form of,
government such a percentage would
give Le Pen a huge amount of power. '
He would be able to influence dom-,
estic and foreign policy. With 1992
just around the corner, Le Pen could:
have a profound effect not only on

Western Europe, but on the United’
States as well. ‘

Brady Bunch redefines the ‘F’ word .

 

MY VIEW
By Jon Sbar

 

My continuing search for answers
in the Failure of Contemporary Re-
lationships between the sexes has
brought me to the inevitable
‘“‘F’’word. The emergence of fem-
inism in the 20th century is a key
component in this ongoing battle be-
tween men and women and therefore
must be fully comprehended.

To find out where and when the
feminist movement really started, I
consulted Dr. Lippendrip Bonehead,
P.H.D., in family life, famous for his
dissertation entitled, “‘Is Your Fami-
ly’s Alpha Dog a Bitch?’ He con-
sidered television to be the most im-
portant factor in the feminist move-
ment.

According to Dr. Bonehead, T.V.
was initially anti-feminist with pro-
grams like ‘*Leave It to Beaver”’ in
which Mrs. Cleaver wore dresses and
took orders from Dad, Wally and even

the Beaver. But then came ‘*The
Brady Bunch’’and that critical ep-
isode when the Brady females went on
a housework strike and realized that
playing baseball was more fun than
doing the dishes. At that point,
women all over the globe realized that
like the Brady women they too could
wear groovy bell bottom polyester
pants and play sports better than the
Brady boys who were obvious sissies.

Dr. Bonehead explained that men
probably would have adjusted to this
moderate Brady Bunch type of fem-
inism if it hadn’t evolved into an ultra
militant variation. In the interest of
journalistic compassion I decided to
see a militant feminist speciman
firsthand. After many strings were
pulled, I was finally granted an inter-
view with Melba ‘‘The Beast’’ San-
tini. Here are excerpts from the inter-
view:

Jon: So Melba, what exactly are you
militant feminists trying to accom-
plish?

Melba: First of all, we think that
women should fight in any wars over

the next 200 years to get even for any
fighting the men did for us. Secondly,
we hope to outlaw large breasts be-
cause they make construction workers
gawk and whistle which demeans
women. Naturally, we also believe
that make-up and dresses should be
banned. And our last and most impor-
tant wish is to censor nature programs
which sensationalize the fact that male
big horn sheep treat their females like
cow dung.

Jon: But male big horn sheep do
treat their females like cow dung.
Melba: That’s irrelevant.

Jon: Is it true that your advocate
chauvinocide — the torture and killng
of male chauvinists like Bugs Bunny?

Melba: Yes.

a

Jon: Do you use steroids?

Melba: My attorney has advised me ,
to ignore questions of that nature.

Before I finished interviewing Me- *
Iba she shared with me the exlusive,
Militant Feminist World Evil Chant:

1. Cheerleading
2. Hustler Pornography Magazine

3. The fact that men do not men-’
struate

4. The fact that men do not get’
pregnant

-

5. Mini-skirts ‘

6. The atom bomb, war, world hun- °
ger and cruelty to animals

‘

 

 

In my next article we will talk
with well-known chauvinists and
decide if we like them any better
than the militant feminists. Also, we
will analyze the man-woman debate

from the perspective of the once
idyllic campus of Washington and
Lee University in Lexington, Vir-
ginia.

Has depression already set in with
the start of the school year? If so, the
Washington and Lee peer counselors
can help you break this melancholy.
According to Dr. James Worth, Uni-
versity Psychologist, the W&L peer
counselors are students trained in
listening skills to deal with problems
such as drug and alcohol abuse, sexua-
lly transmitted diseases, problem
pregnancy, and depression, to name a
The purpose of the program is to offer
students an alternative to the Washing-
ton and Lee professional counseling
staff.

A student can contact a peer counse-
lor by calling the ‘‘Hotline’’ or the
counselor’s residence. The Hotline
operates every night of the week and
the number of the Hotline and its
scheduled hours are listed. Dr. James
Worth states, ‘“The nice thing about
the Hotline is the student can call
anonymously.’

The student also has the option of
meeting face to face with a peer coun-
selor; however, the peer counselors
are not expected to have long-term
counseling sessions. According to
peer counselor Carrie Jennings,
‘Counselors are not supposed to go
beyond three face to face counseling
sessions, since at that time a profes-
sional would be of more help to the
student.’ If the student encounters a
problem different from the one
already discussed with the peer coun-
selor, then the student can again seek
the counselor for advice. Meredith
Walker, Head Peer Counselor, notes,
“I see the student-counselor sessions
as a one shot deal. If the student were
to keep coming back, I would recom-
mend him to the W&L professional
counseling staff or to an appropriate
agency or resource because these
alternatives could give the student
more help than I could.”’

All matters the peer counselor con-
fronts are strictly confidential with the
exception that Dr. Worth may be con-
sulted to assure the counselor he or
she has given good advice. Dr. Worth
notes, ‘‘I oversee the program and un-
less the student is dangerous to him-
self or other people, all material is
treated confidentially. Even among
the peer counselors, names are not

Sigma Chi receives award

 

By D. Street
Staff Reporter

The Sigma Chi Fraternity at Wash-
ington and Lee University recently
received the Legion of Honor Schol-
arship Award at Sigma Chi’s 41st an-
nual Leadership Workshop in Dekalb,
Il.

The Legion of Honor Award is gi-
ven annually to those campus chapters
selected as having commendable
scholarship programs, W&L’s Sigma
Chi Chapter was among 54 of the 207
active chapters honored for the
1987-88 academic year.

The delegates from W&L were
President Robert Tompkins, Vice
President David Emerich, Treasurer
Jeff Trussell, Pledge Trainer John
Perkins, and Rush Chairman Gary

McCullogh. The award was presented
to the chapter’s delegates at the work-
shop, where they were involved in
various lectures and discussions on
ideas and methods for successful chap-
ter operations, activities, and schol-
arship. The Sigma Chi workshop, the
largest in the Greek- letter world, is a
four-day program , which this year at-
tracted more than 1,300 student and
alumni leaders of the fraternity from
43 states and four Canadian prov-
inces.

Sigma Chi was founded in 1855 at
Miami University, Ohio, and is head-
quartered in Evanston, Ill. In addition
to its 207 undergraduate chapters, the
Sigma Chi Fraternity has 128 active
alumni groups and more than 156,000
living members, students and alumni.

lectures at VMI

By Becky Reynolds
Staff Reporter

 

An effort must be made to find a
way for the world to live in peace in-
definitely, Sen. Howard Baker said
Thursday night, Sept. 15, in a lecture
at Virginia Military Institute

**You are the great asset. You are
the people who can invent a way to
live in peace forever,’ Baker said to
the corps of cadets in Cameron Hall.

Last night’s lecture was the fourth
in the H.B. Johnson Jr. 1926 Distin-
guished Leadership Lecture Series.
Gen. Sam S. Walker, Superintendent
of VMI, gave the opening remarks
and introduced the endower of the lec-
ture series, Mr. Belton Kleberg John-
son.

Baker, who received a standing ova-
tion at the beginning and end of his
lecture, began by saying he put his
dreams of becoming President of the
United States behind him to become
President Ronald Reagan’s Chief of
Staff in February 1987, because the
party really needed him. ‘‘I made that
choice gladly and I have no regrets,”’
Baker said.

Baker left his post as White House
chief of staff for family considerations
on July 1, 1988. ‘‘I took the summer
off and took the opportunity to think
about issues as a private citizen,”
Baker said.

Baker said that although he believes
the political system in our country is
exquisite, it must face challenges be-
cause these times are different than
any other. He said, ‘‘We possess the
power to incinerate every living crea-
ture on this planet. The biggest chal-
lenge is to live peaceably without a
nuclear exchange indefinitely.”’

Its a strange paradox,’’ Baker con-
tinued, ‘‘that the best way to avoid
war is to remain militarily strong. I
believe we (the U.S.) are strong.”

Baker said that this makes a contri-
bution to indefinite peace but the job is
far from over. ‘‘The nation’s ambition
is 100 percent elimination of nuclear
weapons — a strategic arms treaty
(START). Negotiations with countries
possessing nuclear arms must con-
tinue until Congress ratifies this
treaty,’’ Baker said.

“*Essentially I’m an optimist and I
believe we will survive,’’ Baker con-
cluded.

Baker, who served as Republican
Senator of Tennessee for 18 years and
was senate Majority Leader from
1981-1985, put in a plug for Republi-
can presidential candidate George
Bush and Reagan’s position in the
Iran/Contra hearings during question-
ing. ‘‘I am convinced that Ronald
Reagan did not know about the
Iran/Contra affair and it was conduc-

ted without his authority,”’ Baker
said.
About the series, Walker said,

‘This series has been most significant
to our mission at VMI — building
leaders. Mr. Johnson established this
endowment to stress leadership to
honor his father.

Volleyball team
opens with bang

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

In its first-ever varsity competition,
the Washington and Lee women’s vol-
leyball team won the Randolph-
Macon Woman’s College Tournament
last Saturday in Lynchburg. Not a bad
way to start off a collegiate program.

‘“‘That’s a pretty fast out of the
blocks so I’m very happy,’’ said head
coach Susan Dittman. ‘I thought we
played well, and it was good to get
wins against those teams because
they’re the teams we have to beat in
the conference.”’

During the tournament, the Gen-
erals beat three Old Dominion Athle-
tic conference rivals. W&L opened
with a hard-fought 15-4, 10-15, 15-3
win over Hollins. The Generals then
breezed by Sweet Briar, 15-9, 15-9, to
gain a berth in the championship with
R-MWC. After dropping the first
match to the host school 12-15, W&L
stormed back to capture the next two
matches—15-6, 15-8—and the cham-
pionship.

‘*We were a little inconsistent, but I
attribute that to our inexperience,’’
said Dittman. ‘“We were having
trouble passing serve [attacking off
the opposition’s serve]. That’s proba-
bly one of our weaker areas. When we
blow a couple of those points, we get
down on ourselves and lose confi-
dence.’

Dittman said freshman Mena
McGowin turned in a strong perfor-
mance, leading the team in blocks and
attack percentage. The third-year head
coach (the team spent the past two
seasons as a developmental program)
also praised the play of sophomore
Connie Papazickos, who came off the
bench and played a key role in the win
over R-MWC.

‘‘The freshman are performing
well,’’ said Dittman. ‘‘They have
more experience than some of the up-
perclassman. I want to also point out
that the girls that started with the pro-
gram have showed great progress as
well.”’

Looking at the ODAC this season,
Dittman thinks Eastern Mennonite and

The women’s volleyball team shows some emotions Monday after receiving the plaque
for winning the Randolph-Macon Woman’s College tournament on Saturday.

Bridgewater are the teams to beat. As
for the remainder of the conference, it
remains to be seen as to how well the
Generals will fare. Schools such as
Lynchburg, Roanoke and Emory and

Henry are the programs that will pro-
vide stern tests for the squad.

Two matches are on the schedule
for the Generals this week. Today,
WA&L plays host to a tri-match with

Southern Seminary and Roanoke at 6
p.m. in the Warner Center. On Satur-
day, the Generals travel to Washing-
ton, D.C. for a tri-match with Catho-
lic and Bryn Mawr.

For one week, Student Pavilion was home sweet home

 

By Jay Plotkin
Staff Reporter

 

Question: What is one of the keys to
having a successful team?

Answer: Unity. Every good team
has it. Okay, the Chicago Bulls may
not have a lot of unity, but they’ve got
the next best thing. If you have Mi-
chael Jordan, you don’t need a lot of

* unity.

The Washington and Lee men’s
soccer team doesn’t have Michael
Jordan, so they’ll just have to settle
for unity. Head coach Rolf Piranian
wanted his team to have a great deal of
unity, so for a week before the arrival
of students to campus, the soccer team
lived in the Pavilion. Why?

‘‘We felt a lack of team unity in
years past. This yéar, the upperclass-
men,.and freshmen got to know each
other better because we were all living

in the Pavilion. The intent was to pull-

the team together. It worked,”’ said
Piranian. »-

Senior co-captain Mike Veliuona
felt the same way. ‘‘It gave us unity
right off the bat. In previous years, the
upperclassmen would come down a

day or two early, and the freshmen
came down later. That kind of held us
up during practice. This year, we had
unity right away. We all had the same
schedule. Things went much better,
and we knew everyone’s name, which
helped during practice.”’

Piranian thinks that the week spent
in the Pavilion has been a positive
force on the team’s performance on
the fields. ‘‘I think that the combina-
tion of the Pavilion and playing on a
new field has elevated the games of all
our players.”’

This season, the team has brand
new fields to play on, and they chris-
tened the new field with a 3-2 win on
Sunday over then 18th-ranked Johns
Hopkins. This game meant more to
the team than an ordinary home
opener.

‘*Last year, we played in Baltimore,
and we felt we didn’t get a fair
shake,’’ said Veliuona. ‘*They beat us
1-0, but we had two ‘goals called back
and played them pretty even after they
scored early on. We felt we were
robbed, and we wanted to prove that
we were a better team than they
were.”’

with a few injuries. One of the most
notable of those injured was junior
forward Ricky Silva.

Not to worry though. In steps soph-
omore David Gilmore. In his first
start, he scored twice in the first eight
minutes of the game. The first goal,
Gilmore’s first NCAA goal, was as-
sisted by junior Patrick Brown. The
assist gave Brown the school assist re-
cord,

Said senior co-captain Steve Udi-
cious, ‘‘Our starting eleven has been
together for a while, and we’ve gotten
solid play from the reserves, David
Gilmore had a great game Sunday in
his first start. He replaced Ricky Si-
lva, who was injured, and was tre-
mendous.”’ :

Freshman David Hooker’s goal late
in the first half made the score 3-1,
and, according to Veliuona, put the
game away. ‘‘The score was 3-2, but
they scored a goal with 1:30 left. For
all practical purposes, we won 3-1.”

Women’s soccer makes

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

If there is such a thing as ‘‘victory
in defeat’, then the Washington and
Lee women’s soccer team came close
to accomplishing such a feat last Sat-
urday against Roanoke.

The Generals (1-2) lost 4-0 to the
Maroons on the new Liberty Hall
field. The scoreboard, however, did
not tell the entire story.

In the two games against Roan-
oke—the defending Old Dominion
Athletic Conference champions—a
year ago, W&L was outscored 15-2.
So, it is obvious that the Generals are
much more competitive with the top
tearhs in the conference this season.

**4-0 is a great game for us,”’ said
head coach Jan Hathorn. ‘‘The thing
that was the most satisfying for every-
body was that they had to work hard to
beat us. They really had to play soccer
to beat us. We weren’t necessarily a
pushover.”’

Hathorn praised the defense for its
outstanding play, especially goalie

of keeping their offense from start-
ing.”’ .

Also playing well was junior goalie
Jack Pringle, who often ranged from
the goal ‘to punch away potentially
troublesome balls.

Eariy Wednesday afternoon, Roan-
oke College scored two second half
goals, the last with 18 minutes left, to
come from behind to hand the Gen-
erals a 2-1 defeat in the ODAC opener
for both teams. The Generals’ lone
goal was scored by junior Scott Levitt
off an assist from Gilmore. The loss
left the Generals 2-1 on the young
season.

This year’s team is based around a
group of five seniors, who are playing
together now for a fourth year. Off the
field, they are friends, and on the
field... ‘‘As a group, we’re confident
of each other. We like to say that we
know what each other is going to do
during the game, but we have a pretty
good idea most of the time. I’m eonfi-
dent that the’seniors up front (J8hnny
Sarber and Jamie Urso] will score the
goals, and the seniors in the back
[Halpert and Udicious] will prevent
goals. I try to do my part in the middle
to control the game,”’ said Veliuona.

Sherri Brown. The sophomore made
several great saves that not only kept
Roanoke from scoring but also gave
the Generals all important momen-
tum.
‘Sherri Brown had an excellent
day,’’ said Hathorn. ‘‘That’s the best
goaltending I’ve ever seen her play. I
think, because she came through with
some saves of shots that normally
might have scored or at least last year
might have scored, that got people
fired up.””

The Generals had some good chan-

ces to score but just could not capi-
talize. Junior Sarah Allen had a direct
kick on goal that just missed and, in
the last 15 seconds of the game, a
W&L breakaway also failed to con-
nect.
‘*The opportunities we had were so-
lid ones and they were legitimate,’’
said Hathorn. ‘‘We should have
scored on them but that’s the breaks of
the game and I don’t feel bad about it.
The fact that we did things correctly is
what’s important.”’

It doesn’t get any easier for the
Generals this week. Today, W&L

Said Urso, ‘‘For the most part, the
school is not really conducive to
sports. There’s not a lot of fan sup-
port, but the guys on the team and the
coaching staff have made playing
nowfor four years worthwhile.’’

Co-captains Udicious and Veliuona
feel that this year’s team could recap-
ture the ODAC title that it won in
1986. Both agree that this year’s team
has great potential, but they must be
wary. According to Udicious, ‘‘This
year we have the potential to be the
best team in my four years here. We
won the conference in 1986, and we’-
ve got the potential to do it again.
We’ ve just got to take it one step at a
time.”’

Veliuona said, ‘‘We have a really
good and mature team. The freshmen
have been filling in where we need
them. If we play to our capacity, we
could win the ODAC again.”’

He is also quick to warn, however,
that ‘‘this year there is not one team
that we can look past in the confer-
ence. Every team has the ability to
beat each other. We just have to play
to our capacity.”’

And let the chips fall where they

travels to Ashland to play Randolph-
Macon. The Yellow Jackets finished
second in the ODAC a year ago. On
Saturday morning at 11:30, things get
even more difficult when the Generals
face Marymount, the 10th-ranked
team in the nation in Division II.
Marymount barely beat Randolph-
Macon, 2-1, earlier in the year on a
goal scored in the closing seconds of
play.

“I expect we are going to have to
play with the same kind of intensity
and fight and drive as we did against
Roanoke,” said Hathorn. ‘‘Pretty
much for the next two weeks that’s the
way it’s going to have to be.”’

Hopefully, the Generals will be able
to maintain that level of intensity and
enthusiasm over a stretch of tough
games, something that the team had
trouble accomplishing last year.

‘*We're definitely learning how to
do that,’’ said Hathorn. ‘‘That’s a po-
sitive thing. There is not a game on
our schedule where we can ‘blow it
off’ in a sense, and not that anyone
would want that.”’

Polo tops
lona in

tournament

By Tom Wingfield
Staff Reporter

 

 

Washington and Lee’s water polo
team took a giant step towards becom-
ing one of the best teams in the East at
the Southeast Varsity Invitational in
Annapolis, Md., last weekend.
W&L’s impressive performance
against three of the top six teams in the
East has propelled the Generals into

the number four ranking.
W&L, ranked 19th in the nation en
tering the tournament, opened the

weekend by beating 18th-ranked Iona
9-8. The Generals never trailed in the
game and were led by senior David
Reavy’s three goals. This victory over
Iona not only assured W&L of finish-
ing among the top four teams in the
East, but marked the first time in
W&L history that the water polo team
has beaten Iona.

The Generals’ semifinal game was
against the number one team in the
East and 10th-best team in the country
— Brown. The Generals, who may
have suffered an emotional letdown
after such a big victory, started the
contest a little flat and fell behind
early. The score was 7-1 Brown after
the first half, but the Generals fought
back, making the game close before
losing 11- 8. Despite the loss, head
coach Page Remillard was far from
discouraged. ‘‘My experience in
water polo, international or national,
has shown me that when two teams are
separated by only three goals, they
can play again two hours later and the
other team could win,”’ he said.

W&L’s third game was played
against 17th-ranked Bucknell, who
had lost to Navy in the other semi-
final game. The Generals could never
gain the lead as they seemed to be hurt
most by a week transition game.
Senior David Dietz, who scored seven
goals against Brown and five versus
Bucknell, said, ‘‘We should have bea-
ten Bucknell but our counter-attack
defense hurt us. Otherwise, though,
we played very well against set
offenses all weekend.”’

Remillard was very excited about
the performance of his team and was
very much looking forward to going
to the Northeast Varsity Invitational at
Brown in two weeks.

‘*This team has accomplished more
than any other team in W&L history
already this season,’’ said Remillard.
‘*We’re playing water polo at an elite
level. This team believes in itself.
They know what they can accom-
plish.”’

Dietz and Reavy both agreed that
this past weekend has proven some-
thing to the team.

‘‘We can beat anyone in the East.
Any of the top four teams could win
the Eastern championships,” said
Dietz.

Cross country
ready to run

 

From Staff Reports

 

The Washington and Lee men’s and
women’s cross country teams open
their 1988 seasons Saturday in Lex-
ington, and both teams expect to be
competitive for Old Dominion Athle-
tic Conference championships.

Both teams start their campaigns
against non-conference foe Mary
Washington on the W&L course on
Saturday. The men start at 11 a.m.,
and the women’s race is set to follow
at 11:45.

Men’s head coach Dick Miller is
taking a realistic approach to his 36th
season

‘*We'’ll take them one at a time,’ he
said. ‘‘That’s the only way we can do
it. I don’t think we'll be nearly as
strong as we've been since we lost
some very good seniors. You can’t
replace them.”’

The men recorded their
10th-straight winning season last year
behind the leadership of veterans Rich
Norris and Scott Rippeon. If there is
to be an Ilth, it will have to come
from this year’s new leaders, Bill
Clark and John Deighan, the W&L
senior co-captains.

Meanwhile, the women have
several veterans to help their cause in
*88. Leading the way last year was
Paige Cason, who captured ODAC
Runner-of-the-Year honors and fin-
ished 17th at the regional. Cason set a
new course record each time she ran
the W&L course last season.

Senior captains Stephanie Smith and
Kim Eadie should provide plenty of
leadership, and some new talent could
push the women to their most success-

ful season in history
‘‘Every year, we've taken some
very positive steps, and that’s been

very encouraging,
Jim Phemister.

New Progressive
show on WLUR

 

By Greg Ossi
staff reporter

 

New to this year’s format is the
show Future History. It is a look at
some of the older progressive bands
and their music. Bands such as REM,
Cactus World News, Chameleons,
and Replacements, will be featured
along with Hereshot Similar bands.
This show was created in an effort to
get more rock air time and allow more
new bands air play on the break
through show.

The group that seems to be the
summer hit all over the college chart
and WLUR is the Sugarcubes. Their
album combines innovative rhythm
and haunting vocals in a very catching
way.

Big Audio Dynamite has a new one
out. The music is tight, fast and sub-
santive. If you like B.A.D., you will
love the album. It you've never heard
of them, definitely check this album
out. The name is ‘Tighten Up, Vol.
’88’’ and some good cuts include
‘*Esquerita”’ and ‘‘Champagne.”’

If you’re a fan of the Smiths, you
will be happy to know that they have
released a love album, entitled
‘*Rank.’’ This album features mostly
cuts off the ‘‘Queen Is Dead’’ and is
very hot.

One of the most exciting late sum-
mer/early fall releases is a compila-
tion album of Joy Division. Formed in
1977 and lasting until 1980 when the
lead singer, Ian Curtis, killed himself,
they were part of the start of progres-
sive music. Of course, the death of
Joy Division gave birth to New Order,
another progressive band. This album
is a must for those fans of Joy Div-
ision, as it is relatively hard to get this
music because most of it is imported
from England.

Other releases to smile about in-
clude The Feelies, James Shriekback,
Close Lobsters, Primitives, The Bible
and a release of Early Love and Rock-
ets.

Next week look for Stanley Jordan
playing ‘‘Stairway to Heaven,”’ Billy
Bragg’s latest and an update on U2’s
release of a single from the
album/movie *‘Rattle and Hum.”’

J-prof requests honor guidelines

« Prof. Hampden H. Smith asked the
Executive Committee to make an ex-
‘plicit statement that students correctly
following guidelines of their profes-

charges.
At Monday night’s EC meeting
‘Smith said, ‘“‘It would be terrible to

ment of Journalism, said he teaches

«students are instructed to use other

IFC initiates
new program:
Live Drive

‘By Clint Wheelock
Staff Reporter

 

, Drunk driving accidents account for
hundreds of deaths and uncountable
‘injuries each year.

To combat this crisis, the Inter-
, fraternity Council outlined a plan,
called Live Drive, at its meeting
*Tuesday night. The program will pro-
,vide shuttle service for intoxicated
students at university functions or
‘fraternity parties in the country. Ser-
vice will go to certain points on or
‘near the Washington and Lee campus
‘at specified times.

‘ Live Drive will use two vans in it’s
shuttle service. The program is at-
tempting to obtain its own van. Each
van will have two drivers trained to
secognize over-intoxication and other
medical trouble signs. The vans are
‘insured and part of the program’s ex-
pense is being paid by the Student Ac-
‘tivities Board. The Executive Com-
gnittee and the IFC are currently con-
sidering giving funds to the program.

The project chairmen assert that
‘they do not want to make a judgement
against underage drinking, but rather,
they want to keep people safe.

Live Drive will begin service
Homecoming weekend. The project
chairmen urge all fraternities to notify
them about house functions in ad-
vance, in order that they can be ready
to help.

East Asian

By Caly Smith
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee East Asian
Studies Program offers students of all
majors opportunities to study abroad.
The W&L program sponsors schol-
arships or exchange programs to To-
kyo, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the
Kyoto-Osaka area during the aca-
demic year and Chinese and Japanese
language studies during the summer.

Professor Roger B. Jeans, chairman
of the East Asian Studies Committee,
encouraged all students to consider
“the wealth of opportunities’ offered
by the program.

To spend the academic year in To-
kyo, a student should have two years
of Japanese classroom experience to
apply for the Rikkyo University
Scholarship. A full scholarship sup-
ports this program with a generous
lump sum given upon arrival, fol-
lowed by additional monthly stipends,
according to Jeans.

Chinese study in Taiwan similarly
requires a student to have two years
credit of Chinese to qualify for the
scholarship offering approximately
$400 a month. Students who have stu-
died in Taiwan have always received
scholarships, Jeans said.

programs offer variety

The third scholarship, funded by the
Mellon Foundation Grant and new this
year, provides funds for students to
take Chinese or Japanese during the
summer. With this program, a student

has a number of options such as study-_

ing at Middleburg College or going
abroad to Taiwan, Japan or China. A
flat sum of $250, $500 or $1,000 will
be granted, depending on the Finan-
cial Aid Office’s assessment of the
student’s finances.

As for the other programs offered,

there is no language requirement for
a student wanting to study at the
Chinese University of Hong Kong or
the Kansai University of Foreign Stu-
dies, since English is one of the main
languages spoken.
’ Jeans said, ‘“‘Hong Kong is no
longer restricted to Chinese language
students; it’s wide open to students of
all majors. I’m hoping that students
will follow a former W&L student's
example who studied in Hong Kong
while pursuing his major of business
administration.”’

The Kansai University program is
flexible since it is not necessary for
the student to study Chinese to parti-
cipate in the exchange program, and a
student may stay for one or two
semesters.

Opportunities also are available for
study in the People’s Republic of
China through the program sponsored
by the University of Massachusetts.
Students can go to the Mandarin-s-
peaking zones of Peking or Sian.

To apply to one of the East Asian
Programs, a student must fill out an

In deciding a candidate’s eligibility,
Jeans said, ‘‘The committee first con-
siders the student’s academic record,
then examines the student’s maturity
level to ensure that he or she could
handle being dropped off in East
Asia.””

This year, Yumi Morishige, Hideo
Shimizv, Kiyomi Kamata, Winnie
Wai-gat Chow and Tiffany Chui-wah
Kwan, are the five exchange students
on campus. Yumi and Hideo are from

EC proposes
new plan for
CRC debate

By SacyL. Morison

Staff Reporter

 

The Executive Committee will draw
up a formal proposal for an alternate
committee to the Confidential Review
Committee, EC President Christopher
deMovellan said.

EC Member Dave Nave said, ‘‘I
think we can come up with the com-
mittee that will please the faculty and
the students. ’’

Issues of concern that the EC has
taken into consideration are confiden-
tiality, the ratio of faculty to students
and representation of the student body
on the committee, said EC Member
Dan DuPre. DuPre and EC Member
John Fialcowitz met with members of
the student body last week to define
what the student body wants.

DeMovellan said, ‘‘I don’t want to
rush this [writing the proposal,] but at
the same time, I feel it is an urgent
matter.’’

Several options for the alternate
committee were considered before the
EC settled on the seven -member
committee. The SCC came to the
meeting and presented their standpoint
again. ‘‘I really feel’that the SCC can
handle those cases,” SCC Chairman
David Burns said. ‘‘If the problem is
confidentiality within the SCC, I
would like to see SCC members to
take part in the counseling program
that the CRC members received.’’

But deMovellan is concerned over
what will happen in following years.
Said deMovellan, ‘‘Most deans agree
that this year’s SCC is stellar, but
what happens the year after that?’’
DeMovellan said continuity is impor-
tant in this type of committee. Often,
he said, student committees are forced
to ‘‘re-invent the wheel’’ each year
when members graduate.

EC Member DuPre said, ‘‘The
problem is not that the SCC can’t
handle the job. The problem is the
cases aren’t getting to the SCC.”’

To absolve the above concerns, the
EC voted 10-1 to propose a committee
composed of two faculty members,
three students from the SCC and two
students-at-large. [All of these mem-
bers will each have one vote.] The fa-
culty members are to be appointed by
President Wilson, and the student
members, including the SCC mem-
ibers, will be appointed by the EC.

EC Member John McDonough
voted against the proposal because he
thinks the faculty members should be
non-voting.

EC Vice-President Hugh Finkel-
stein will go before the faculty Oc-
tober 2, at its montly meeting, to an-
nounce that the EC will submit a for-
mal proposal for an alternate commit-
tee at the faculty’s next meeting.

New Virginia lottery
enriches some students

By Genienne Mongno
Staff Reporter

 

A Washington and Lee student has
cashed in on the new Virginia State
Lottery, which began on Sept. 20.

Senior Brad Gottsegen won $50
when he bought three tickets at Stop-
In last Tuesday. He said he felt lucky
when he walked in, so he decided to
give the game a try. “‘It’s not bad
spending a buck and winning 50,’’ he
said. According to Gottsegen, he was
the only one in the store at the time to
win one of the bigger prizes. Ironica-
lly, someone behind him spent$150
and got only $4 in return.

Other students have been enjoying
the lottery as well. Junior Marty
Smith won $6 but lost it all when she
spent the money buying more tickets.
According to local retailers, about 50
percent of the tickets are bought by
W&L students.

Tickets for the instant win game,
known as Match 3, can be purchased
at several locations in the Lexington
area, and since the game’s inception,
suppliers have had a hard time keep-
ing up with the demand for tickets.
The Stop-In convenience store on
North Main Street sold out of the tick-
ets the first day and has had to reorder
twice.

Although traffic in the participating
stores has increased, both workers and
store owners have mixed opinions
about the game. One worker at Stop-
In said bluntly, ‘‘It’s a pain in the
a--!’’ She commented that among
other problems, people just come in to

buy lottery tickets which has resulted
ina lot of loitering.

Another Stop-In representative,
Francine Carter, said that when there
is a lot of work to do it’s hard tp ac-
commodate everyone. However, she
said she still believes in the lottery if
the profits are really going to help the
Commonwealth.

Miles Nye of Kelly’s Corner con-
venience store said it’s too early to tell
whether the lottery will increase busi-
ness since it’s still a novelty. He said
the first few days were like a ‘‘circus
or carnival’? and his business was
probably hurt by it.

Recently, however, lottery sales
have slowed down somewhat and Nye
believes that business will be helped.
So far Kelly’s Corner has sold about
3,200 tickets and the biggest winner
has won $50. According to Nye, the
majority of the people who win the
smaller prizes of $2, $5, and $10, use
the money to buy more tickets,

Bridget Cooper of the Palms said
that they have had three $50 winners
among the many winners of the smal-
ler prizes. In her opinion the lottery is
a good thing, but she warned, ‘‘Don’t
get hooked!”’

This first phase of the Virginia state
lottery will last about eight weeks. A
second instant game will follow. If all
goes as planned, there will be six
different instant games during the first
year. For every dollar spent on a Vir-
ginia Lottery ticket 35 cents goes back
to the state to be put in Virginia’s
General Fund. Lawmakers will decide
which state programs will benefit
most from the money.
 

 

 

 

OPINION

Decide soon...

It is a fact that many W&L students have been the subject of reli-
gious, racial or sexual discrimination and harassment. Members of
the faculty, the student body, and the administration who are not
perpetrating these prejudices want it stopped. And everyone agrees
that if it is to stop, it must be exposed.

The problem is that most of the students who have been harassed
or discriminated against do not expose the crimes committed against
them because they are embarrassed. Presently, a student who wants
to bring up such a charge must do so in front of the Student Conduct
Committee. Students are obviously not comfortable discussing
these sensitive issues before the SCC, because last year the Com-
mittee heard only two cases while the Dean of Minority Students,
Anise McCloud, heard fourteen.

The faculty felt that students were not bringing these cases to the
SCC because they were worried that secrecy could not be main-
tained on a committee (SCC) consisting of 13 members. To fix the
problem the faculty took the initiative and formed the seven- mem-
ber Confidential Revue Committee. Four of the seven CRC mem-
‘ bers are from the faculty while the other three are students.

Some SCC members are against the CRC because they feel like
the faculty majority is a serious threat to the W&L tradition of stu-
dent government. The SCC warns of the inherent dangers in giving
the CRC unchecked power to investigate and discipline offenders.

The SCC has proposed that it form a small sub-committee that
offers the advantages of the CRC, but keeps power with the stu-
dents. The big question then is whether students would prefer to
bring sensitive issues to their peers or to members of the faculty,
not whether the SCC is capable of handling the cases.

Regardless of how it is done, changes must be made immediately.
As a school, we are not providing the means to help students with
some very serious problems.

There are some common misconceptions concerning committees
that deal with sensitive issues. A lot of male students incorrectly be-
lieve that these committees are support groups for females who
want to whine about chauvinists who hate co- education. These
committees are for all students.

Men are by no means isolated from sexual harassment. In fact,
males who have been harassed by females or homosexuals are very
reluctant to discuss their case with anyone. Males, as well as fe-
males, would benefit from a more confidential committee.

Sexual, religious and racial harassment is unexcusable on any
level. The University must do everything in its power to help elim-
inate these problems and a more confidential committee is a step in
the right direction. If the CRC can do a better job in this area than
the SCC, then they should be allowed to do it. At the same time, the
SCC has some valid concerns that deserve to be reviewed.

Hopefully an effective compromise can be reached...SOON.

America is isolated geographically
but our political involvement is world
wide. It is not good enough to know
that the Atlantic is to the East, the
Pacific to the West, Canada to the
North, and Mexico to the South. As
citizens we can’t hope to influence
national policy towards a nation like
Israel when we don’t know where it
is.
Mr. Bush and Mr. Dukakis have
been very vocal in their discussion of
the Pledge of Allegiance in our ele-
mentary schools. It seems to me they
should worry less about the Pledge
and worry more about what is being
taught. After all, given the amount of
money we spend on defense, we'll
look pretty stupid when we can’t find

All of Lexington not honor-bound

 

MY VIEW
By Beckwith Archer

 

After two weeks of living in a Uto-
pian environment, I received a harsh
welcome back into the real world last
week. I hope that this article will serve
as a warning to everyone on campus
who is a trusting as my roommates
and I were.

I was studying late last Wednesday.
Around 1:30 a.m. I got up to get a
book from my room. I shut the door
behind me and after about two minutes
I began to hear little shuffling noises. I
figured that one of my roommates was
up so I ignored the sounds. Whey they
persisted for about five minutes I de-

cided to go see what it was. When I
opened the door there was a man
standing in our suite with his hand on
the doorknob to one of the tooms. All
I could do was stand there, terrified.
He was about mediurh build with
blonde hair and a tattoo on his right
arm. He very calmly turned and said,
“Oh, I must be in the wrong room,”’

and then he walked out. I turned to see -

which way he went and I saw that he
had propped the front door wide open
with a shoe, in preparation for his get-
away. I have to wonder why instead of
taking the television or microwave in
the den, he had decided to risk going
into one of the rooms, the only single
girlroominthe suite. .

The police and security came and I
was taken to the police station. Ten
minutes after we got there, a call came

Degeneration
by rock-n-roll

 

MY VIEW
By Jon Sbar

 

In order to deal with a vital is-
sue, I have been forced to postpone
my planned continuation of the
male-female controversy in which I
was attempting to determine just
how far a topic could be dragged
out. This issue concerns the
degeneration of America’s youth. As
the reader probably suspects, I have
nothing important to say about it. In
the hopes of making myself more
socially accepted, I am officially
endorsing the Moral Majority’s
efforts to make adolescents more
like Benjamin Franklin.

The problem started in the 60s
when children, who once enjoyed
geography and chocolate chip coo-
kies, became the hippie teenagers

who traveled to Woodstock for .

‘rampant sex, nudity and a haze of
marijuana smoke.’’ Since the 60s,
this vicious youth-destroying cycle
has continued. Even as I write, ado-
lescents about the world continue to
move farther and farther from the
ideals of Franklin. No one knows
exactly why this is happening to our
youth, but it must stop. Some ex-
perts blame a dependence on the
mind-altering ingredients in Lucky
Charms and other psychoactive
cereals, While I support movements
to ban these harmful cereals, I be-
lieve the problem goes much
deeper. It reaches into the very core
of human existence. As you know,

the core of human existence is mu-
sic. Friends, believe me when I tell
you that rock music is destroying
our youth. Rock music takes away
inhibition, encourages -anti-social
behavior and generally makes no
sense —the three things needed to
ruin a young life. Card-carrying
Moral Majority and Woodstock,
N.Y., resident, Minerva Reinscha-
gen said it best when she remarked
that rock music is ‘‘devil inspired.’’

A well-known Tampa, Fla., mu-
sic expert believes that the problem
with rock music is in the drums. He
explained that ‘‘primitive peoples in
ages past have always used the drum
as a means of arousal to warfare or
orgy.’’ and rock music relies heav-
ily ‘‘on the inordinate use of this
percussion instrument.’ The link
between rock music and drugs is de-
finite; the only question is ‘‘whether
the drugs are used to calm down
listeners or arouse them further?’’
Remember, ‘‘music is the language
of the emotions and can make peo-
ple do almost anything.’’ The sad
truth, which Ann Landers has
known for years, is that rock-n-roll
causes insanity.

An addition side effect of rock
music is that it is played so loud that
young fans cannot carry on a con-
versation. Many hardcore fans have
entirely forgotten how to communi-
cate with other humans.

A modern danger of rock music is
music television. In a music telev-
ision video, harmful music is ac-
companied by visual effects, which
include only three elements:

1. effeminate men with very

in. Someone had just been seen going
through a dresser in one of the houses
around campus. For the next three
hours, while: I filled ‘out’ reports ‘and
looked at naug shots, the :police told
me about the crime rate in Lexington.

The amount of crime goes up dras-:
tically when the students return to
school because we are such easy tar-
gets. We leave our doors unlocked,
keys in the car, and valuables laying
around. These people follow crowds
out into the country and make a for-
tune off of the big parties. The only
advice that the police had was to lock
the doors and to make sure that things
left in a car are not visible from the
outside.

The police called me a couple of
days ago and told me that they believe
that they have caught the man who

3. some type of sexual re-
lationship between the effeminate
men and the beautiful women.

Because these videos are so pain-
fully stupid, a person who watches

kill brain cells.

tried to burglarize my room. I must»
testify against him in court in a few
weeks. I am certain that there are’
more like him out there however, I
still do not rest easily until.all of my
roommates are home and the door is °
locked. e

It is impossible for security to be
omnipresent, and unfair for us to ex- ’
pect if of them. Here at Washington ,
and Lee we live in an unrealistic en-
vironment and we become so spoiled +
by honesty and trust that we some-
times forget that not everyone is play- °
ing by our rules. If nothing else comes +
of this article, maybe just a few more
people will lock their doors tonight *
and the criminals will have a tougher
time finding a naive W&L student to
rip off. Lexington, Virginia, is not on °
the Honor System.

‘

 

To save America’s youth from ,
drugs, sex and stupidity, we must
eliminate the generation of acid-fire ‘
rock music. Our children should be »
listening to high-tech bands like
Lawrence Welk, in addition to get-
ting a lot of fiber. I urge my readers ¢
to get involved and help stop this
crisis before it’s too late.

Voter registration held for college students

 

y Brooke Jarabek
Staff Reporter

 

In 1972, the national voting age was
changed from 21 to 18 and almost 50
percent of the 18 -24 age group voted.
However, in 1980, only about 39 per-
cent of this age group voted. Insuffi-
cient knowledge on how to register to
vote and about the candidates and is-
sues themselves are two reasons for
this decline in youth voter turnout.

To solve this problem, the National
Student Campaign for Voter Registra-
tion, the NSCVR, and the United
States Student Association, USSA,
organized a 1500-member National
Student Conference on Voter Regis-
tration in 1984. These students re-
gistered more than 500,000 voters at
750 college campuses. But despite the
increase in new voters, the number of

all 18-24 year-olds who voted still re-
mained at less than 41 percent.

Another voter registration confer-
ence is scheduled Sept. 30-Oct. 2 in
Washington, D.C. to further encour-
age youth votes in the 1988 election.

According to Fred Azcarate, presi-
dent of USSA, ‘‘Once registered, 80
percent of all 18-24 year-olds vote on
election day.’’ This percentage is
equal to other age groups.

Voter registration procedures vary
from state to state. For example, Min-
nesota allows registration on election
day, while Arizona requires registra-
tion 50 days before an election.

New laws, like public law 91-285,
which allow for temporary and mail-
in registration, will make it easier for
students to vote this year.

Any W&L student who has not re-
gistered to vote in the upcoming

Visitor’s Center grows

By Laura Dodge
Staff Reporter

For those who have not heard, Lex-
ington has a new Visitor’s Center.
Located in the Centel Building on
Washington Street directly across
from its old home, the new center has
expanded in both space and content.

In August, the lease for the old Visi-
tor’s Center expired and they moved
across the street where they are open
from 9- 5,

The Visitor’s Center has expanded
to meet the growing number of tou-
‘rist coming through Lexington. In
‘1976, 131 visitors signed the book.
‘This year the number of visitors has
‘already increased 8 percent over
‘1987. on

Jean Clark, head of the Center,
which is part of the Visitor’s Bureau
of Lexington, said that tourists come
‘from March through November, not
just in the summer months. She said
the staff at the center ‘‘must know a
little bit about just about everything.’’
They answer questions on a range of
subjects about Lexington and the East
coast. Clark also said that many for-
eign visitors come through Lexington.

Usually, guides advise all new-
comers in Lexington to visit both
Washington and Lee University and
Virginia Military Institute. W&L’s
main attraction is Lee Chapel, where
General Lee worked the last five years

of his life. The Stonewall Jackson
House and his grave in the city
cemetery are additional attractions. A
guided tour of Jackson’s house is
available every hour on the half-hour
for $3.50. Two museums at VMI are
mentioned as well. One offers a his-
tory of the institute, Jackson and the
Civil War and the other, the George
C. Marshall Museum, gives World
War II history.

To discover additional interesting
Sites, the Visitor’s Center distributes a
general brochure of Lexington, and a
walking guide of the city. It describes
over 40 sites to visit in Lexington. For
those who don’t want to walk, the
Visitor's Center offers a shuttle ser-
vice each day from 9:30 a.m. to 5:00
p.m. The shuttle gathers and delivers
tourists to sites at VMI, Lee Chapel,
“Stonewall’’ Jackson House, and
three stops in downtown Lexington.
The cost is $2 per person.

Another way to view Lexington is
by a carriage tour. These tours are
offered Mon. through Sat., 9:30-5:30
p.m., for $6 per person. The carriage
covers all the walking tour sites, but
does not stop.

The Visitor’s Bureau offers several
displays on area history, local arts,
crafts and industries and local archi-
tecture. Clark said, ‘‘The Visitor’s
Center is here to.sell the area, but we
provide «information ‘on: everything
else too.”’ J

presidential election may pick up an
absentee ballot from Lucille Joyce,
the general registrar, in Lexington
City Hall.

This temporary registration form
may be sent to any state but only al-
lows a citizen to vote in the presi-
dential election. Following the presi-
dential election, the registration is de-
clared null and void. For permanent
registration, a student must officially
register within his precinct.

Virginia residents who have not re-
gistered will find the Virginia Appli-
cation for Temporary Voter Registra-
tion as well as Absentee Ballot Appli-
cation (both are pink forms) at City
Hall. Those Virginia residents who
are registered and are not planning to
attend the polls within their precinct
need to fill out the blue Virginia Ab-
sentee Ballot Application.

  

The deadline for registration in Vir-
ginia is Oct. 8 and absentee ballots
must be received by the county regis-
trar at least 5 days before the election.

**Most states,’’ Joyce said, ‘‘have a
close-out period form 15-30 days
prior to the election for temporary re-
gistration and absentee ballots.”’
Thus, out-of-state students should ap-
ply as soon as possible and Joyce will
furnish them with forms.

Students may register to vote in
Lexington, if their legal address is in
Lexington. A legal address would in-
clude a driver’s license address and
possibly car registration at that ad-
dress.

An important point for students to
remember is that absentee ballots must
be witnessed. Some states may require
notarization. Two notaries who work
in the W&L Treasurers ottice are
Myrna Zybco and Sharon Edwards.

Foxfield races draw 5,000

By Eleanor Nelson
Staff Reporter

 

 

Pal

Brooke Tinley, sophomore, Ti-
monium, MD. ‘“‘I think Bush won
because of his foreign policy.”’

Despite last Sunday’s cold and wet
weather conditions, approximately
5,000 people attended the Foxfield
races in Charlottesville.

The crowd was considerably smal-
ler than previous years, drawing only
about 5,000 people. Typically the
races draw 18,000 to 25,000, accord-
ing to J. Benjamin Dick, organizer of
the races.

Albemarle County police said viola-
tions were down this year primarily
due to the smaller crowd. The police
arrested eight individuals for underage
possession of alcohol and five for
drunk in public. One policeman said
that although these people were not
the only ones drunk at the event, they
‘‘were falling down drunk. We don’t
bother them if they can walk.’’

Three people were arrested for pos-

session of marijuana, one for posses-

sion of mushrooms, one for driving
under the influence of alcohol and two
for trespassing. Seven people received
traffice summonses.

The general admission ticket price
increased from $8 to $10 and field
tickets increased from $40 to $60 this
year. Despite the fact that ticket prices
have not increased for a few years,
according to the race’s organizers,
several students were displeased with
the rate increase. Race’ organizers said
increasing costs of running horse
races spurred the price rise.

Some fraternities cancelled plans to
attend the races despite previously
purchased tickets and chartered buses.
Among the students who did attend,
the typical afternoon of tailgate parties
and socializing did take place. One
student reflected that despite .the.smal-
ler crowd, ‘‘there were still long lines
at the bathroom!”’

VMI exhibit opens

By Tina Vandersteel
Staff Reporter

 

The first major exhibition ever as-
sembled of Civil War Confederacy art
opens formally tomorrow, at Virginia
Military Institute’s Jackson Memorial
Hall and it will remain on display ,
free to the public, until Dec. 12.

The display, titled ‘The Confeder-
ate Image: Prints of the Lost Cause’’
will open at 7 p.m. with lectures by
Harold Holzer of New York City and
Gabor S. Boritt of Gettysburg, Pa.,
who are the two of the three authors of
the book by the same name. The pub-
lic is also invited to attend a reception
after the lectures at 7:30 p.m. in the
museum.

The exhibit features a compilation
of over 50 original 19th century en-
gravings and lithographs, including

Confederate etchings by Adalbert J.
Volck and portraits of Confederate

heroes Robert E. Lee, ‘‘Stonewall’’
Jackson and Jefferson Davis. Most
historians agree that these images of
the “‘Lost Cause’’ helped unify the
Southern people after suffering dev-
astating losses in the war. These pic-
tures, which decorated the walls of
family homes, schoolrooms, and pub-
lic buildings during and after the Civil
War, helped to remind the Southern
people that their cause was a noble
one.

Holzer and Boritt’s book, co-
authored by Mark E. Neely, has been
well-received all across the nation. It

has been features in numerous
national publications, including
**American Art Journal.”’

The exhibit, sponsored by Gettys-
burg College, the Pennsylvania Hu-
manities Council and the Lincoln
National Life Insurance Company
opened last year in Gettysburg in July.

Wright became a member of the fa-
culty at UVa in 1983. Among several
writing awards, Wright received the
National Endowment for Arts awards
in 1974 and 1984. In 1975. he was
awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in

so far, Tiffany said the demanding
work, the helpful professors, the
beautiful campus and the crazy party
atmosphere stuck out in her mind. She
said, ‘‘The fraternity atmosphere is
too crazy for me, yet the people here
are very friendly and even though I
can’t understand all the English I en-
counter, I am learning and I enjoy
that."’

In previous years, one speaker a
year came to represent all of East
Asia. In 1985, the program received a
Mellon Foundation Grant that enabled
the program to offer two to three
speakers a year, plus some sort of cul-

ture event.

Jeans said, ‘‘In 1986, we sponsored
a No Drama Performance. Last spring
we held a Japanese Film Festival and
this year we're again going to view the
Pacific War Film Festival and possi-
bly sponsor a Peking Opera perfor-
mer.”’

According to Mark Spiessi who
spent last year at Kansai Gaidai, the
East Asian Studies Exchange Program
is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that
will completely change a person. He
said, ‘‘A student would be wrong to
pass up the opportunity, if even vague-
ly considering it. It’s something that
can never happen again since college
doesn’t last forever.

‘‘One cannot deny there is a world
outside the United States and to waste
the opportunity offered by the East
Asian Program is almost a crime.”’

Washington and Lee University’s

Culminating ‘‘High Tech’’ Day was
a presentation by Dr. Edward A.

presentation was open to the public in
Lee Chapel. Brown, a 1962 graduate,
is director of the High Power

Brown majored in physics at W&L
and holds a master’s degree (1964)
and doctorate (1970) from New York

tinued on as a civilian employee at
HDL and was named recipient of the

| The Washington and Lee cross
| country teams opened their respective
; Seasons with mixed results last week-
end in Lexington.

The men split a tri-meet with Mary
| Washington and Washington College.
i s, led by senior Billy
| Clark, lost to Mary Washington 17-45
‘ but defeated Washington College
45-95. Clark finished fourth overall,
covering W&L’s five-mile course in
29:04.

‘*We ran as well as could be expec-
ted,’’ said men’s head coach Dick
Miller. ‘‘It was rainy. We ran against
a good team. Mary Washington is a
good men’s team.”’
| Mary Washington took the first
; three places of the race and, after

{and six to clinch the victory. Other
iscorers for W&L were Charles Ed-
| wards (8th, 30:03), Lee Parker (10th,

and Kennon Walthall (13th, 32:12).

; The Generals just didn’t have the
‘depth against Mary Washington,

| ‘*We’re not as deep as we were last
lyear, or the year before,’’ he said.
\‘*The point is, we lost [Scott] Rip-

Staff Reporter

When W&It ahd Centre meet on the
football field, you can bet the ranch
and the dog on the home team.

Since 1980, the host squad has won
every time the two schools have met in
football. And Saturday the home team
won with an exclamation mark, as the
3-0 Colonels rolled to a 30-16 victory.

While the score wasn’t close,
W&L’s head coach Gary Fallon
seemed optimistic about his team’s
play against Centre on offense and on
defense.

‘*I saw a number of really impres-
sive things we did,’’ said Fallon.
‘‘Outside of our special teams, that
game might have turned out to be a
one-touchdown win.”’

As they did two weeks earlier
against Emory & Henry, the Generals
(0-2) struck first. Junior fullback Rus-
sell Crosby scored on a 33-yard trap

But the Colonels responded with a
scoring drive of their own. Centre
quarterback: ‘Kelly ..Sandidge - capped
the drive with a one-yard touchdown
run, but kicker David Harr missed the
extra point, so W&L held on to a nar-
row 7-6 lead.

But one of three W&L special-
teams disasters followed on the ensu-
ing kickoff. Sophomore slotback Carl
Gilbert took the kick but fumbled the
football when he was hit. The
Colonels recovered and went on to
take a lead they would never relin-
quish. A 21-yard field goal by Harr as
the first half ended put Centre up 9-7.

The third quarter began with spe-
cial-teams disaster number two — a
91-yard kickoff return for a touch-
down by Centre defensive back Berry
Hayes. Harr converted the PAT to
make the score 16-7.

W&L’s next drive stalled after only
three plays, and senior Tom Skeen
came on to punt. But the kick was par-

needed only an 8-yard drive to go up
23-7 and put the game out of reach.

True; the Generals would goon to *

add nine more points. —three on a
30-yard Quayle field goal and six ona
26-yard pass from junior quarterback
Chris Smythe to sophomore slotback
Tyler Suiters — but the Colonels used
a 7-yard scoring pass from Sandidge
to tight end John Bruner to keep the
Generals from pulling rank and
preserve the win.

HASHMARKS— W&L will play
host to Randolph-Macon (1-2) Satur-
day at 1:30 p.m. The Generals won in

Volleyball turns
in strong week

 

By Beckwith Archer
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee women’s
volleyball team, in its first varsity
season, is off to a very impressive
Start.

The Generals split three consecutive
tri-matches over the past week. Yes-
terday, W&L defeated Shenandoah
but lost to Mary Baldwin in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference opener
for the Generals.

The week began with W&L (6-3)
splitting a tri-match with on Thursday
night against Roanoke and Southern
Sem. The first match of the night be-
tween W&L and Roanoke saw Roan-
oke the victor, 7-15, 12-15. W&L
came storming back in its next match
however, defeating Southern Sem in
two straight games 16-14, 15- 8. The
Generals trailed in the first game by as
much as 14-8 before making an excit-
ing comeback. The win over Southern
Sem was the team’s fourth win of the
year over the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference team.

Both head coach Susan Dittman and
student coach Steve Baldridge are
very pleased with the team and the
strides that it is making. They think
the strength of the team lies in the
unity and cohesion among the players.
Although this is a young team, the
freshmen have come in ready to work
hard alongside the veterans. There
have already been a few injuries on
the team. Junior Joanne Even has a
sprained ankle and will have to sit out

From Staff Reports

 

The W&L women’s soccer team
split four games over the past
week. The Generals traveled to
Randolph-Macon last Thursday
and fell 4-0 to the Yellow Jackets

« and then dropped a 6-0 decision to
Marymount, highly ranked in Div-
ision III, on Saturday in Lexington.

The team rebounded on Monday
with 2-1 home victory over Guil-
ford. Freshman Katie Seeman
scored both goals for the Generals.
W&L (3-4, 2-2 in the Old Domin-
ion Athletic Conference) made it
two in a row Wednesday, with a
3-0 win over Sweet Briar. Fresh-
man Ashley Gray put the Generals
in front early and junior Catherine
Baillio added two goals to put the
game away. Sophomore goalie
Sherri Brown made eight saves en
route to her second shutout of the
season.

The Generals take on North
Carolina Wesleyan in an away
game on Saturday.

 

SPORTS NOTEBOOK

 

for about a month. The remaining in-
juries, however, are relatively minor

Senior co-captain Melissa Thrasher,
who was very happy with the team’s
performance Thursday, said, ‘‘We
were optimistic going in tonight, even
though we knew that [Roanoke] were
a really good team. We hung in with
them which is something we couldn’}
do last year. Our team gets more ex}
perienced every time we walk out on
the court and I think that next time we
play them we will have a good chance
of beating them.”’

The consensus seems to be that the
big improvement for the Generals this
year is their hitting and blocking.
Seniors Amy Smith and Vanessa
Hartman are big hitters who have
sharpened their skills since last year,
Mena McGowin and Marcy Brown
are very promising freshman hitters.
W&L also has very yood setters in
freshman Lori Rhodenizer and soph-
omore Lisa Jay.

The weekend was also successful
for the Generals. The squad had mat-
ches against Bryn Mawr and Catholic,
schools that Dittman wanted to play in
order to beef up the schedule. Though
the team lost to Bryn Mawr in a close
game 6-15, 15-13, 10-15, Dittman
was pleased to come away with an
11-15, 15-9, 15-4 win over Catholic.
She said Jay’s outstanding perfor-
mance at the setter position was what
made the difference in the Catholic
match.

The next home match for the
women’s volleyball team is Wednes-
day at 6 p.m. in the Warner Center.

aw

certainly will be no rest for the
squad this weekend.

The Generals play one of the
most crucial tournaments of the
young season this weekend in
Providence, RI, when they travel
to compete in the Northeast Varsity
Invitational. The 16-team event
features the best polo programs in
the East, <7. “)*' ’

 

The W&L men’s soccer team
dropped a couple of tough contests
last week, but scored an important
conference win Wednesday over
ODAC rival Eastern Mennonite.

The Generals (3-2, 1-1 in the
ODAC) lost to Roanoke last
Thursday 2-1, despite out-shooting
the Maroons 21-10.

On Saturday in Lexington, the
team suffered a 3-0 loss to highly-
ranked North Carolina Wesleyan.
W&L, however, salvaged the
week with a 1-0 win yesterday over
Eastern Mennonite. Junior Rick Si-
lva took a Steve Udicious pass and
connected for the game- winner in
the first half.

The Generals travel to Pennsyl-
vania on Saturday to renew a tra-

Local bands play for
Jamaican Hurricane relief

By Dana Bolden
Staff Reporter

According to Robert Luciano,
‘Rockbridge County has never seen
anything like this!’’ Luciano, owner
of Lexington’s Subway shop, is refer-
ring to this Sunday’s Gilbert Relief
Aid Festival in Rockbridge County.

Luciano says the festival was desig-
ned to help the residents of Jamaica,
whose homes were destroyed by hur-
ricane Gilbert two weeks ago. ““We
started this effort because there is a se-
rious need for help. Because Rock-
bridge County is where I reside. I
wanted to include the people of the
area in this effort.’’ Luciano said.

The festival, which features ten
bands and different types of food, will
begin at noon on Sunday and last all
day. The event will take place in the
Heart of the Forest, a dell that is lo-
cated about 14 miles west of Lexing-
ton on Route 60.

Several groups came together to
make this event happen, students from
Washington and Lee University, Hol-
lins College and Virginia Military In-
stitute offered their time. Luciano says
the bulk of the volunteers are county
residents who agreed this was a good
cause, ‘‘Many people wanted to ex-
tend their hearts and their hands to
make this project work and help those

   

in need,” Luciano said.

Ihe organizers went before the
Rockbridge County Board of Superv-
isors Monday night to secure a permit
for the event. According to Luciano,
they were granted a permit, on the
condition that the rules the county set
forth will be met. He says almost all
of the rules have been met, but the
Supervisors must see proof of this, in
writing, before they actually deliver
the permit.

Through the sale of T-shirts, tickets
and donations, he hopes to raise about
$10,000. The proceeds will go to buy
food, bottled water and building sup-
plies. Luciano says he has arranged
for transportation of the items to Ja-
maica, also ‘‘Many companies have
offered to match whatever is bought
from them.”’ He offered an aluminum
company as an example, “‘However
much aluminum roofing material we
buy from this company, they will
match that amount as a donation.”’

Tickets can be purchased at the
Subway Sandwich Shop for $10 be-
fore the festival or at the festival for
$12. Tickets are two dollars less if
canned goods are donated when tick-
ets are purchased.

Luciano says the festival will be
‘Irie Man!’’ (Loosely translated: a
good time will be had by all!)

VOLUME 88, NO. 4

 

By Elizabeth Parkins
Tri-Editor

Debate over the existence of sorori-
ties at Washington and Lee continues
this fall with the creation of a stu-
dent/faculty committee.

According to junior Wendy Wilson,
the committee was formed in response

to a petition circulated at the end of
last winter term.

Over the summer letters were sent
out to all female students asking if
they would be interested in joining the
committee. Dean Atkins, advisor to
the committee, received 64 responses
and of these, 11 were chosen to serve.
Along with the students, five faculty
members (all women) were asked to
participate.

Agents

Last weekend marked the 17th an-
nual Class Agents Weekend. The
agents were wined and dined by the
university to honor the those who have
dedicated service to Washington and
Lee.

A Class Agent is an alumni, who
has agreed to solicit donations to the
annual fund from his classmates. His
duties include writing three letters a

“Opinion was not a factor in the
choosing of the students. Whether the
person was for or against sororities
wasn’t known at the time of the de-
cision,”’ said Wilson.

At the inaugural meeting this past
Monday, the committee discussed
several steps which will soon set the

panel, including representatives from
Davidson College and Washington
and Lee, will be present to answer

According to Wilson, the informa-

not support sororities.

“Our biggest worry is response.

We need to know how people feel. We

have not been given specific numbers,

just to look for ‘significant’ numbers

when making the decision.’’ said
Wilson.

If these ‘significant’ numbers indi-
cate that women are in favor of sorori-
ties, a tentative schedule will be made
up. This includes January Rush for
upperclass women and spring Rush
for freshmen.

On the other hand, if W&L women
overwhelmingly say ‘no’, the commit-
tee will be disbanded and that will be
the end of the question for this year.

graduating class.

The annual fund, according to Car-
ter McNeese, associate director of de-
velopment and director of the Annual
Fund, consists of ‘‘unrestricted gifts
from alumni, parents, and friends of
the university.’’ This fund supports
the daily operating expenses of the
university including faculty salaries,
electricity, telephone bills, etc. The

money can be spent in any manner the
University wishes.

Using an annual fund to subsidize
the budget is not unique to W&L,
however, the university is ‘‘one of
very few schools that uses class agents
almost exclusively to solicit funds for
the Annual Fund,’’ explained
McNeese.

McNeese elaborated further on the
function of the Annual Fund and the
W&L budget. The annual fund sup-

Leading thinker gives

Staff Report

 

Russell Kirk, identified by Time
and Newsweek as ‘‘one of Ameri-
ca’s leading thinkers,’’ will deliver
two lectures at Washington and
Lee University on Tuesday, Oct.
11. The public is invited to attend.

Kirk’s first speech, ‘‘The Gath-
ering of Gentlemen,”’ will be at 3
p.m. in the Moot Courtroom in
Lewis Hall, the W&L law school.
At 7 p.m. Tuesday evening, he will
speak on ‘‘The American Presi-
dency: Hoover Through Reagan’”’
in the Northen Auditorium of the
University Library.

Kirk writes and speaks on politi-
cal thought and practice, edu-
cational theory, literary criticism,
ethical questions and social
themes. The Conservative Mind,
one of his 23 books, is perhaps the
most widely reviewed and discuss-
ed work of political theory in this
century, a W&L_ spokesperson
said. Other books written by Kirk
include The Roots of American Or-
der, a history of ideas and institu-
tions; Decadence and Renewal in
the Higher Learning, biographical
studies of John Randolph of Roan-
oke, Edmund Burke, and Robert
Taft; four volumes of literary

political perspective

social essays; and five volumes of
fiction. He also is the author of
several hundred periodical essays
and short stories. His work has
been published in 20 foreign coun-
tries.

A frequent speaker on American
campuses, Kirk also often appears
on both educational and commer-
cial television and radio. He now is
helping to produce a series of 13
one-hour films based on his book,
The Roots of American Order, to
be shown nationally on public
television stations.

Kirk is the editor of the quarterly
journal University Bookman. He
also was founder and first editor of
the quarterly Modern Age. For 13
years his syndicated column, To
the Point, was distributed by the
Los Angeles Times Syndicate.

Kirk received his bachelor’s de-
gree from Michigan State Univer-
sity and his master’s from Duke
University. Honorary doctorates
have been conferred on Kirk by
Boston College, St. John’s Univer-
sity, Park College, LeMoyne Col-
lege and Loyola College, among
others. He is the only American to
hold the highest earned arts degree

IFC re-evaluates Rush

By Clint Wheelock
Staff Reporter

Most of Tuesday’s IFC meeting was
devoted to voicing opinions and sug-
gestions for future Rush regulations
by the sixteen fraternity delegates.

“The biggest problem this year,”’
IFC president Ross Singletary said,
‘‘was that there were a lot of grey
areas [in the rules]... lots of things we
hadn’t even thought of came up.”’
Multiple fines were given out this year
by the IFC for Rush violations, most
of which dealt with infringements of
alcohol and no-contact rules.

Also, as Vice President Jeff Kelsey
commented, ‘‘Most freshmen don’t
even know what’s going on before
they sign up[for open houses].’’ The
importance of BYOB parties before
sign-up was stressed, so that rushees
would have a better idea of which
houses they were interested in and in
what manner they wanted to approach
the open house period.

Also, some delegates favored fewer
open houses and more rush dates, with
possible revision of the sign-up situa-
tion. A suggestion was made describ-
ing a system whereby the rushee
would sign up for eight open houses,
the order to be randomly chosen such
that every open house could be treated
with the same vigor as the first few.
The general sentiment was that broth-
ers strongly favor freshmen who come
through toward the beginning of the
open house circuit, depriving the later
ones of the same attention.

Overall, the council agreed that the
present system works quite well, but
that a few revisions for next year’s fall
rush might make things easier and a
bit more fair for all involved

 

get, earnings from the endowments,
gifts from the past that have been in-
vested, equal about 25 percent, and
the rest comes from corporation and
foundation donations.

“It (the Annual Fund) really makes
the difference here of W&L being a
top quality school as opposed to a run-
of-the-mill school. It provides a mar-
gin for excellence,’’ McNeese said.
Furthermore, ‘“W&L has been listed
as a best buy for the past several years
because of the tuition cost compared
to the quality of the education, and
one of the reasons is the Annual
Fund.”’

Last year, class agents set a record
by raising $1,895,784 from 7,129 do-
nors. This year’s goal is $2 million.

Class Agents exist for every class
that has been graduated for 50 years or
more. Out of the 100 class agents and
three officers, 49 attended, coming
from areas such as Houston, Atlanta,
Buffalo and Roanoke.

McNeese estimated that ‘‘about 75
percent of the people who as serving
as class agents have been here in the
past three or four years.’’ Class
Agents usually serve three to five
years. However, this year marked
Charlie Longacre’s (Class of ’33) 20th
year as an Agent. The chairman for
the second year in a row is Hardin
Marion, ’55, ’58 law.

The agents discussed plans for the
coming annual fund year and were
briefed on the state of the university.
On Friday they received dinner in
Evans Dining Hall. They attended a
Saturday morning workshop in the
Moot Courtroom, the football game,
and a Saturday evening cook-out at the
home of Ferris Hotchkiss, vice presi-
dent of university relations.

EC rules on plagiarism policy

By Stacy L. Morrison
Staff Reporter

 

 

The Executive Committee voted at
its Monday meeting to make an “‘in-
formative statement”’ in its plagiarism
guidelines that students operating
under a professor’s directives cannot
be brought up on honor charges.

This action is in response to Journal-
ism Prof. Hampden H. Smith’s
request for clarification of a student’s
position between the Honor System
and his professor. Smith appeared be-
fore the EC last Monday night.

Hugh Finkelstein, vice president of
the EC, said, ‘‘This statement is in-
formative, and is not to be used as a
defense’’ in honor trials.

E.C. Member Dave Nave, who will
word the revision, agreed that this
statement should not be ‘‘codified”’
into the procedural guidelines of the
White Book.

The EC decided not to make the
statement in the White Book. EC
Member Chris Giblin said, ‘‘It
wouldn’t hurt, but I don’t think we
need it.””

In other business, the EC will hold a
public meeting about the CRC and the
EC’s alternate committee proposal in
Lee Chapel. The date is tentatively set
for Oct. 12 at 7 p.m. Finkelstein said
the meeting’s goal is to educate for a
student referendum.

EC Members Dan DuPre, John
Fialcowitz, John McDonough and Al-
ston Parker are currently writing the

Sororities:
yes or no

The 1988-89 school year could prove to be a very important year
for the future of this university and its students. However, the be-
ginning of every school year holds this truth. This year is no

 

different.

Soon the women of this university must make a major decision
about the future of sororities on campus.

Since 1985 when the first coed class enrolled, the women have
been struggling with the question of sororities. Several attempts to
begin some sort of process of establishing sororities have fallen by
the wayside. With each new attempt little progress was made.

Without discussing the merits or demerits of establishing sorori-
ties, it is important to make a decision NOW. Much time has been
wasted counting and recounting and analyzing what the women
want. Time and again the women have been asked ‘*Do you want
sororities?’’ and time and again nothing resulted.

If the women do not want sororities, then so be it. Drop the issue.
If they do want them, then get representatives on campus and start

Rush.

I realize that it takes careful planning to successfully implement a
sorority system but at least make a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ decision.

Because of the indecision, confusion, and delay that has taken
place since 1985 the women of the senior class may now be ex-
cluded from the process. Even if they are not excluded, they may
well miss out on what they should have had three years ago.

“The Duke’’

 

MY VIEW
By Jim Lake

 

Autumnal musings on the campaign
of Massachusetts’ favorite charlatan,
presidential candidate Michael S. Du-
kakis:

In the tradition of Johnson and Ken-
nedy, it’s Bentsen and Dukakis —
Lloyd and the Duke! Yeah! To par-
aphrase Jesse Jackson, the long night
is over, the morning has come! At
last, an administration like that of JFK
and LBJ — a pair we could count on, a
pair we could trust!

Wait a minute...the Atlanta conven-
tion speakers didn’t quite go that far.
Sure, the idea of repeating the cam-
paign success of Kennedy-Johnson
sounds great to Democrats and has
some appeal to overgrown hippies
with teary-eyed memories of the Ken-
nedy assassination. But somehow the
years in between those two tragic
events don’t make me want to shout,
‘*Kick some ass, Duke!”’

Remember, the team that brought
America a Democratic White House
in 1960 is the same team that brought
us cabinet-level nepotism, sixties in-
flation, the Bay of Pigs fiasco and the
war in Vietnam — hardly high points
in American history.

No, it may be sacrilege for me not
to bow and cross myself when I say
‘*JFK,’’ those hallowed letters of the
American left, but I'll take the chance.
The Austin-Boston connection was
bad for America in 1960, and, as far
as this observer is concerned, the
same is true in 1988.

**Say it ain’t so, Jim! How can you
find even a single reason why we
shouldn’t vote for Massachusetts’ sav-
ior, Lord Michael Stanley?”’

A single item! I’m sorry, but it’s
impossible to pick out just one. So,
with the permission of The Ring-tum
Phi editorial staff, I'll use some space
in this issue to explain why Gov. Du-
kakis has no more business being elec-
ted president than Jimmy Carter, Billy
Carter or Nell Carter.

las Morning Newspointed out not long
after the Democratic Convention,
‘*‘Mr. Dukakis is more than a bore;
he’s a charlatan.’’ The Duke is pre-
tending to be a competent centrist
when he is in fact the opposite — an
incompetent extremist. And the
national media are letting him pull off
this campaign of vague innuendo and
meaningless rhetoric because their
leaders can’t stand the thought of an-
other Republican in the White House.

Let’s put the “‘Gospel according to
Rather’’ to rest. Dukakis did not raise
Massachusetts from the dead and is
not the savior America longingly
waits for. Hard to believe, I know, es-
pecially considering the reports that
have been oozing from the liberal
propaganda machine in_ recent
months, but true nevertheless. And, if
George Bush campaigns as he should
in the few weeks remaining, he can
win by a landslide. Here’s why:

© The Duke on corruption: the gov-
ernor and his friends got together in
Atlanta to pound their chests and cry
with shock and indignation over the
many ‘‘scandals’’ in the Reagan Ad-
ministration.

(Interestingly, the name of Ray-
mond Donovan, the former transpor-
tation secretary who was crucified and
scarred for life by the Democrats be-
fore a grand jury concluded that char-
ges against him should never have
been brought, was not mentioned at
the Atlanta convention. But the name
of former Attorney General Edwin
Meese, whose life was picked apart by
a independent prosecutor but who was
never convicted, indicted or even
charged with anything, was loudly
trumpeted. You see, only Democrats
are presumed innocent until proven
guilty.)

But the Democrats somehow found
it easy to forget that, as Howie Carr of
The Boston Herald points out, their
nominee ‘has presided over the most
corrupt administration in the last 25
years of the already-ripe history of
Massachusetts state government.”
Here are some highlights:

MY VIEW
By Jon Sbar

My efforts to explain why Ameri-
ca’s children are scoring lower on
standardized tests than many inani-
mate objects like the Ronco Fishing
Rod has brought me to television. It’s
not that children are watching too
much television (about 16 hours a

 

day), it’s the kinds of television shows ,

they’re watching. The problem started
when kids began rejecting classic car-
toons like Bugs Bunny and Friends for
trashy sci-fi metalloid cartoons. Sur-
geon General C. Everett Koop is very
concerned and recently summed up
the problem in an important presi-
dential meeting. Luckily, I happened
to be in the President’s office at this
tim@jof this important disclosure.
President and surgeon general
were playing poker and drinking beer
in the oval office when all of a sudden
things got serious: President: ‘‘Hey,
doc, pass me the peanuts. By the way,
why are children so damn stupid?’
Surgeon General: ‘‘Well, Ron, it’s
T.V.’s fault. A long time ago telev-
ision programmers provided quality
shows for America’s youth. With
heroes like Woody Woodpecker, chil-
dren learned to be clever, violent, he-
donistic, and not to underestimate the
intelligence of animals—the four qua-
lities an American needs to lead a pro-
ductive and wholesome life. But
nowadays television programs for our
youth are dominated by characters
who talk slowly, never have a good
time, and rarely expand energy at-
tempting to carouse with members of

 

 

 

 

 

 

the opposite sex. Individuals with
names like Metalhead and Titanic
Teeth are typical characters in a new
generation cartoon. These inorganic
characters are encouraging our youth
to use drugs like WD-40, talk slowly
and to be generally stupid.’’

To help the Surgeon General in his
effort to save the children I have
formed a Bugs Bunny Fact Finding

Committee. It’s a good head start for
our lost youth.

Bugs Bunny:

Will not go 10 seconds without
disguising himself as a seductive fe-
male

Is generally ruthless but can occa-
sionally be sympathetic to charac-
ters who are down on their luck.

Chile warms to democracy

 

MY VIEW
By Julia Kirk

In September 1973, atter a bloody
military coup in which the President
of Chile, Salvadore Allende, was
killed, General Augusto Pinochet as-
cended to power. He has been Presi-
dent of Chile ever since. On October
5, Chileans decided if the 73-year- old
dictator would continue to rule their
country. The election was a plebiscite
and Pinochet was the only candidate.
The people voted simply ‘yes’ or ‘no’.

Pinochet is considered one of the
worst human rights violators in the
world. People disappear often in Chile

This is, in effect, an addendum to the Univer-
sity’s parking regulations for 1988-89 and thereaf-

Although I am the duly designated parking Czar
(that is, ticket fixer) for the University, I have
neither the professional training nor the time to
engage in daily quasi-legal debates on whether or
not the University has been explicit enough in
making clear all the places motorists are not sup-
posed to park. Neither is there enough yellow
paint in Lexington to define all these places, nor
does the University wish to create a veritable
forest of No Parking signs. Instead, I resort to this
method of informing all those affected by Univer-
sity regulations as to what is parking rightly and

The map issued to those who register their

and vocal opposition to the regime is
illegal. Seemingly, there is no ques-
tion that Pinochet will lose; however,
before deciding the election out of
hand, one must look at the success of
the Chilean economy.

Chile’s economy under Pinochet is
nothing short of miraculous (eat your
heart out Duke). Unemployment is
falling, investment is rising, the bud-
get is very nearly balanced, real GDP
has grown 4-5 percent for three con-
secutive years and inflation hovers
about 12 percent a year. (Brazil's in-
flation rate is around 60 percent).
Furthermore, great steps have been
taken to diversify Chilean trade. Cop-
per, once Chile’s most important ex-
port now accounts for only 40 percent

of the trade receipts. Exports such as:
toys, computer software, defense
equipment, exotic fruit are becoming
increasingly important. Consequently ,
in 1987 Chile enjoyed a trade surplus
of $1.2 billion. If Pinochet loses in
Chile, he can come fix our economy,
right?

Wrong. Chile’s growth has been
‘paid for with domestic austerity; per
capita income is 12 percent below that
of 1981. Pinochet has forced ‘belt
tightening’ on his countrymen in a
way that would be impossible in a
democracy.

both right and left wing groups, have
formed a coalition, ‘‘Command for
the No.’’ The Command is supported

registration (sticker), parking in a parking area
that matches the sticker is not only permitted but
encouraged. Parking anywhere else on the Uni-
versity grounds is not only discouraged but is sub-
ject to penalties specified in the printed regula-

tions.

The University security officers assigned to en-
force parking regulations are trained to differen-
tiate between University parking areas and those
parts of the campus that are not parking areas. In
handling appeals of parking tickets I will depend

upon the good judgment of these officers in the

decisions involving:

— Whether or not the vehicle was in a desig- |*
nated parking area.

— Whether or not the vehicle is authorized to
park in the parking area.

— Whether or not one’s parking technique,
even when exercised within a designated parking
area, has introduced an unacceptable hazard to the
safety of others. Such a hazard may include, but is
not restricted to, the blocking of access to fire,
emergency, and service vehicles.

If anyone is in doubt about where they should
park, I'll be happy to tell them where to go. To
paraphrase the axiom that a former administrator
of parking justice at Lewis Hall used to quote:
‘You wrongly choose, you surely lose.’’

Will always prevail in any envir- ,
onment but is sometimes vulnerable
to evil anti-rabbit factions who ma- +

Thomas P. Rideout, promoted to president of the American Bankers Asso-

ciation.

W&Lalumnus elected
head of bankers’

group

by Eleanor Nelson
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee alumnus
Thomas P. Rideout will be inau-
gurated as president of the American
Bankers Association on Tuesday, Oct.
11, at the 1988 convention in Hono-
lulu, Hawaii.

Compared to the association’s pre-
vious presidents, Rideout is unique.
He is only the third’ ABA treasurer in
the associatign’s pistory to become
president.

He is senior vice president and di-
rector of governmental affairs at First
Union Corp., Charlotte, N.C. First
Union is among the top super-regional
banks in the southeast.

Rideout has experience in lobbying
and serving on ABA committees that
prepare him for issues currently fac-
ing the ABA. He has served on the
government relations council, the
board of directors, and chaired the Fu-
ture Issues Task Force.

The ABA is the national trade or-
ganization for commercial banks. It
has about 12,000 members, which ac-
count for 95 percent of the nation’s
banking assets.

The banking industry faces issues
greatly pending on Congressional de-
cisions. Rideout is uniquely prepared
in dealing with the legislature as a di-
rector of governmental affairs at First
Union, and having chaired the Future
Issues Task Force for the ABA.

As president of the ABA, Rideout
has two primary concerns for the
banking industry this fiscal year. ‘‘A
resolution must be found for the fail-
ing savings and loans, and banks need
to broaden the types of products and

Interviews by Copeland Kapp

services they can offer,’’ said
Rideout.
Rideout identified the insolvent

thrifts as the industry’s main problem.
They cannot be liquidated by the
FSLIC because it lacks the capital.
Rideout dimly views one possible so-
lution of the FDIC assuming the
FSLIC’s debt: ‘‘It makes no financial
sense and would simply be unfair to
make banks bail out the‘S&L’s.

“Banks are currently frozen to a
small portion of the financial services
market; they can’t even compete with
the products and services other finan-
cial institutions can offer. As a trade
association, the ABA is involved with
the whole question of appropriate pub-
lic policy, meeting the needs of the
economy, and really meeting the
needs of the consumer,”” he said.

A European history major at W&L,
Rideout said education has always
been important to him. ‘*In addition to
the courses in history, I took courses
in political science and economics,”
he said.

“IT am encouraged to see W&L’s
continued emphasis on the liberal arts
with the additional discipline of cour-
ses in finance and commerce,”’
Rideout said. He cited the relationship
between the liberal arts departments
and the departments of commerce,
economics and politics at W&L as
unique and ‘‘doing a fine job of de-
veloping the various disciplines. ”’

He has returned for summer alumni
college sessions and last year spoke at
the spring alumni reunion, which was
his 25th. Rideout’s daughter,
Schuyler, is in the sophomore class at
W&L.

Lake

 

Someone should ask the governor
about Gerald Indelicato, a former ad-
visor and close friend whom Dukakis
named president of Bridgewater
(Mass.) State College in 1987. Indeli-
cato, while Dukakis was bellowing
about Edwin Meese during the week
of the attorney general's resignation,
was awaiting sentencing in federal
court in Boston; the Duke’s buddy had
earlier pleaded guilty to a series of
felonies involving bogus consulting
contracts.

Someone should ask the governor
about Francis Plilecki, whom Dukakis
named president of Westfield State
College in 1978. Plilecki resigned a
few years later after he was accused of
homosexual molestation. Neverthe-
less, the Duke and his buddies allowed
Plilecki to return to a professorship at
Fitchburg State College, where he had
been accused of making sexual advan-
ces to a young man in 1976.

Someone should ask the governor
about George Ripley, a former busi-
ness agent for the Bricklayers’ Union.
That union gave $5,000 to the Duka-
kis campaign committee on June 10,
1983, even though the Duke had been
elected just seven months earlier and

 

wouldn’t be up for re-election for
three years. Five days later, Dukakis
fired his state labor commissioner and
replaced him with— you guessed it —
George Ripley.

But Ripley didn’t last long. ‘Ihis pil-
lar of good government hired his two
daughters to work for him and was
eventually fined by the Massachusetts
State Ethics Committee and forced to
resign. It appears the Duke didn’t
quite live up to his pledge to abolish
“lock, stock and barrel’’ the rampant
patronage system that is Massa-
chusetts state government.

¢ Dukakis and the truth: The gov-
ernor says he is a member in good
standing of the Greek Orthodox
church who is able to receive all sa-
craments. Now I couldn’t care less
what religion Dukakis is, but I do
have trouble with fraud, and this reli-
gious claim appears to be just that.

First, the governor married outside
the church. Second, his children were
never baptized. Third, for 20 years he
has been ineligible to receive certain

sacraments. Furthermore, he has
Openly supported homosexual
*‘righs”’ and abortion.

As Bishop Kallistos, one of Greek
Orthodoxy’s leading theologians, ob-
served, ‘Dukakis has no right to pre-
sent himself to the American public as
a member of the Orthodox church.”’
Russian Orthodox Bishop Hilarian of

New York said, ‘‘It is rank hypocrisy
to identify oneself with a particular re-
ligious faith when one does not, in
fact, practice that faith or uphold its
moral precepts. A man of integrity
would not do this.”’

In short, the Duke is lying, probably

using the church to build some sort of

ethnic base. The question is, will the
national media question their candi-
date on this matter the way they but-
chered Pat Robertson over the date of
his marriage? Don’t bet on it.

According to Washington columnist
Pat Buchanan, when Evans and Novak
raised the religion issue in their
nationally syndicated column, The
Washington Post cut their article to
ribbons and left out vital quotes so that
the question of hypocrisy was hardly
raised at all. And, according
toNewsweek, ABC’s Sam Donaldson
said during the Republican convention
that the delegates there had ‘‘better be
glad I’m leaving the White House beat
in November, because, if Bush gets
elected, I'd savage him.”’

Clearly, in the few weeks remain-
ing, George Bush won’t be getting any
help from the Dukakis fans that con-
trol the evening news programs and
some of the nation’s largest papers. If
the truth about the Duke is to be
known, it won’t be Dan Rather and
company that tell it. The Vice Presi-
dent has his work cut out for him.

we would try to get experts on it for a
panel discussion. ”’

Financing for the 1988 series is
provided by the W&L Executive
Committee, which will provide
$17,000, and by the Inter Fraternity
Council, which Roach expects will
provide around $10,000.

Spencer
publishes
geology text

 

By Genienne Mongno
staff reporter

 

Edgar W. Spencer, professor of ge-
ology at Washington and Lee, re-
cently published the third edition of
his leading geology text, Introduction
to the Structure of the Earth.

In this new edition, Spencer pre-
sents a broad up-to-date review of
structural geology and tectonics (geo-
logical structural features as a whole).
The text also describes the structures
of the mountain system and the
oceanic crust in addition to the me
chanics of the deformation of the crus ,,

and their formation, large and small =

features and the way the features
form, Spencer said.

Professor Spencer received his
bachelor of science degree in physics
from Washington and Lee in 1953 and
his doctorate in major-structural ge-
ology from Columbia University in
1957. He joined the W&L faculty in
1957 and has been head of the geology
department since 1959.

Liberty Hall

Volunteers
sponsor Lee

memorial

A memorial service honoring Gen.
Robert E. Lee will be held at noon
Wednesday, Oct. 12, in Lee Chapel
on the Washington and Lee University
campus. The ceremony will mark the
118th anniversary of the death of Lee,
who served as president of Washing-
ton College from 1865 to 1870.

The memorial service is being spon-
sored by the Liberty Hall Volunteers.

The day’s activities will begin at

9:30 a.m., the time of Lee’s death in
1870, when the bells in the chapel will
toll 19 times — the equivalent of a
19-gun salute. At noon, the Liberty
Hall Volunteers, a group of W&L
students interested in Civil War re-
enactment, will march from Washing-
ton Hall to Lee Chapel.

Following the presentation of the
colors, Louis Hodges, W&L chaplain,
will give the invocation. Hodges will
be followed by Capt. Robert Peniston,
director of Lee Chapel, who will give
introductory remarks about Lee. The
W&L Glee Club will offer a selection
following Peniston’s remarks.

Taylor Sanders, professor of history
at Washington and Lee, will speak on
the life of Lee and his contributions to
Washington College. Benediction will
follow the W&L Glee Club’s singing
of How Firm a Foundation, Lee’s
favorite hymn. The service will then
adjourn.

Airport plans continue

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

The Rockbridge County Board of
Supervisors last week voted to begin
negotiations with a Herndon engineer-
ing firm that may be selected to update
the master plan for a county airport.

Campbell and Paris was selected in
a 4-1 vote after a motion to enter into
negotiations with Hays, Seay, Mattern
and Mattern was defeated 3-2.

The county had interviewed four
firms that were interested in the study
but rejected two of them last month.

Gene Lucas, a spokesman for
Campbell and Paris, said engineers
from his firm will attend the board’s
meeting Oct. 11.

While the firm has looked at the
existing master plan and what changes
may have to be made, Lucas said

Campbell and Paris engineers have
only begun examining the area, its
needs and a possible site. He said the
firm would not be prejudiced against
alternatives to the site selected in the
original master plan.

‘‘Our intention is to take into ac-
count the positives and negatives of
the existing site,"’ Lucas said, but
*‘there would be a need to investigate
other potential sites.”

If the board votes to allow Campbell
and Paris to update the plan, the
agreement between the firm and the
county would then go before the Fed-
eral Aviation Administration for its
approval.

Ninety percent of the cost of the
study would be paid by the FAA, and
the remaining ten percent would be
paid by the state and the local
governments involved.

Harriers sweep by |
ODAC-foe Roanoke §

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

Racing in near-perfect conditions
last Saturday, the Washington and Lee
men’s cross country team turned in a
near- perfect performance.

The Generals (3-1) dominated the
proceedings, defeating Roanoke and
Norfolk State by identical 26-53
scores in a tri-meet on W&L’s 5-mile
course. Top honors belonged to senior

It was a good week for the Washing-
ton and Lee men’s soccer team. The
Generals went 1-1 for the week with
win over Hampden- Sydney and a loss
to eighth-ranked Messiah, making
their record to 4-3 on the season and
2-1 in the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference.

On Saturday, the Generals made a
journey to Messiah College in Penn-
sylvania. Messiah was ranked No. 8
in the nation in Division III coming
into the game, making them the third
nationally-ranked team and the second
top-ten team that W&L has played this
season (North Carolina Wesleyan and
Johns Hopkins were the other two).

The final score was 2-0, but the
game was highly contested through-
out. It was just a case of Messiah be-
ing bigger and a little bit quicker than
the Generals.

team’s overall effort still has plenty of
room for improvement.

**We had our top five within four
minutes of each other,’’ he said. ‘*Not
good, but acceptable at this time of the
year.”’

Earlier last week the Generals
received some bad news. Sophomore
Larry Pilkey, one of W&L’s top run-
ners, was diagnosed as having a stress
fracture in his right leg. Pilkey, who
suffered the injury in the team’s first
meet of the season, will most likely be
out for the rest of the year.

The Generals will travel this Satur-
day to Catholic University in Wash-
ington D.C. to take on the host school
as well as Old Dominion Athletic
Conference rival Lynchburg.

As for the type of course the team
will run on this weekend, Miller has
absolutely no idea.

“It’s very difficult to access at this
time because you never know what it’s
going to be until you get there,’’ he
said. ‘“‘They never run the same
course two years in a row. So, I don’t
know where they are going to run it.”’

‘*They were undefeated, and ranked
in the top ten in the country,’’ said
head coach Rolf Piranian. ‘‘They
were significantly bigger than us and

quicker than we were.”’

Said senior co-captain Steve ‘‘Sid’’
Udicious, ‘‘We played really well.
They didn’t get their second goal until
late in the game when we were press-
ing to score the tying goal. They were
sharper than we were because they
had played more games, but as far as
them being better than us—if we could
have gotten a couple of breaks—we
could have beaten them.’’

In spite of the fact that the Generals
were undersized and overmatched,
they did not give up and got several
fine efforts from different players.
Junior Patrick Brown starred again for
W&L and received help from reserve
goalie Jon Bull. Replacing the injured
Jack Pringle, Bull made several, ac-
cording to Piranian, ‘‘fantastic’’ saves
to keep the Generals in the game. Pir-

Macon football game goes

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

For the third straight year, the
W&L/Randolph-Macon football garne
went down to the final play. Only this
year, nobody won.

A pass from W&L junior quarter-
back Phillip Sampson was picked off
by Mike Hanson as the clock ran out,
but the Macon linebacker was tackled
at the W&L 33 to leave both teams
disappointed with a 10-10 tie.

While the game was not a loss, it
did cost the Generals (0-2-1) dearly.
Senior split end Keith Boyd, who had
caught one or more passes in 12
straight games, suffered a broken
right leg and will miss the remainder
of the season.

‘‘I’m very upset that Keith isn’t go-
ing to be with us,’’ head coach Gary
Fallon said about the loss of his top
pass-catcher. ‘‘He means so much to
us as a performer and a team leader.”

Even though the Generals lost a
starter, in a sense they found another.
Sampson alternated with junior Chris
Smythe throughout the afternoon, and
the former backup proved he deserves
to be considered for a starting role.

But Fallon prefers to see the play of
his two quarterbacks as complemen-
tary rather than competitive.

‘‘When Phillip’s in there, we ask
him to do some things we wouldn’t
ask Chris to do,’’ said Fallon, who
also calls on Smythe to do some
things—namely, running the op-
tion—that he rarely asks of Sampson.

And, while Smythe’s numbers (sev-
en of nine for 177 yards) were clearly
better than Sampson's (three of 10 for
85 yards, one touchdown and one

interception), Fallon is quick to point
out that Sampson played more downs
when Generals had to throw—and
when the defense knew it.

After W&L was stymied on its
opening drive, Macon started the scor-
ing with a 38-yard field goal by Mark
Palmgren with 6:45 left in the first
quarter.

The two teams exchanged punts be-
fore the Generals began a 3-play,
75-yard scoring drive.

After picking up four yards on two
plays, the Generals faced third and
six. Sampson found junior tight end
Bob Martin over the middle for first-
down yardage, but W&L would get
more than just a first down on the
play. Key blocks by Boyd, junior full-
back Russell Crosby and senior run-
ning back Tony Waskiewicz and some
nice footwork of his own gave Martin
a 70-yard touchdown reception and
the Generals a 7-3 lead.

In the second quarter, both head
coaches rolled the dice on fourth
down, and both coaches lost. But
neither team could capitalize on the
other’s gambles.

And, when the Yellow Jackets
threatened late in the half, W&L
senior linebacker Tom Skeen snagged
his team’s first interception of the
season. Skeen returned the picked-off
pass to the W&L 23, where the offi-
cials later said he stepped out of
bounds. Sampson came on to down
the football for the last play of the
half.

Macon came back in the third quar-
ter with a 14-play, 63-yard scoring
drive. Running back Mike Ste-
fanko—only a freshman—carried sev-
en times for 26 yards, including the
final two for Macon’s lone touch-

anian also said that freshman Chet
Lewis played some very respectable
minutes in his first varsity game.

“It was a hell of an effort on our
part,’’ said Piranian. ‘‘We were bea-
ten by a clearly better team, but we
were there the whole way. We had
some breakdowns. They outshot us
20-11, and if you get as many chances
as they did, something is bound to
happen.”’

On Tuesday, the Generals traveled
to Hampden-Sydney for a big ODAC
game. Last year’s game, which in-
cluded a fight, was won by the Tigers.

‘*Last year was a bitter pill for us to
swallow, because we outplayed
them,”’ he said. ‘*We just didn’t outs-
core them. I hope the officials will
control the game better than last year.
They have some ‘head hunters’ over
‘there, and if the refs don’t control the
game, it will be hard not to have a
physical game. They’re a good defen-

sive club, and this is a big ODAC
rivalry.”’

This year’s game was different than
last year’s. The Generals were never
challenged as they defeated H-SC 3-0.
Junior Scott Levitt scored early off an
assist from freshman David Hooker.
Levitt took Hooker’s pass and beat a
couple of Tiger defenders. His shot
came from about 18 yards out. It
snuck past the goalie and kissed off
the near post into the goal to give the
Generals a 1-0 lead. Senior Johnny
Sarber scored twice to provide the
final margin of victory off assists from
sophomore David Gilmore and senior
Mike Veliuona.

With only one conference game left
in the season, against Lynchburg on
Nov. 1, ‘‘the winner of that game will
probably win the conference title,’’
said Udicious.

The Generals play Marymount at
home this Saturday at 2 p.m. up on the
Liberty Hall field.

down to the wire — again

down. Palmgren’s kick gave the Yel-
low Jackets a 10-7 lead.

Neither team threatened until the
end of the period, when Smythe found
Boyd for a 47-yard gain and a W&L
first down at the Macon six.

But one of the biggest plays of the
game turned out to be the last of
Boyd’s career. The senior broke both
bones in the lower part of his right
leg, and the 2,000-plus fans at Wilson
Field waited in silence as the Lexing-
ton Lifesaving Crew and trainers from
both teams put Boyd’s leg in a brace
and carefully lifted him onto a stret-
cher.

When play resumed, Smythe car-
ried for a gain of one to give the Gen-
erals a second down at the Macon
five.

The Macon players had been talking
to the Generals all afternoon, and the
officials apparently decided they had
had enough. As the teams returned to
their huddles, the Yellow Jackets were
hit with an unsportsmanlike conduct
penalty that Fallon expected would
give his team an automatic first down.

Instead, according to Fallon, the
officials told him that the dead-ball

penalty did not include an automatic
first. The penalty moved the Generals
half the distance to the goal line, plac-
ing them on the Macon three.

Facing second and goal, Waskie-
wicz carried for a loss of one as the
third quarter ended.

‘‘We should have scored on that
play,’’ Fallon said later. ‘“‘One guy
came over the top and just got a hand
on Tony.”’

Smythe threw an incomplete pass
intended for Martin on third down,
and the Generals decided to settle for
the tie. Sophomore Carter Quayle

They finally beat ‘em.

After three previous tries that ended
in nothing but frustration, the Wash-
ington and Lee women’s soccer team
scored a historic win over Hollins yes-
terday afternoon on Liberty Hall
Field. The Generals scored three
goals in the second half, including two
in the final ten minutes of play, to beat
Hollins 3-1.

Last season W&L lost all three
games it played against Hollins with
the most disappointing loss coming in
the first round of the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference tournament. All
three were games the Generals could
have—and probably should
have—won. This year’s contest,
however, was never in doubt.

“I really wasn’t in doubt,’’ said
head coach Jan Hathorn. ‘‘I would
have been very highly surprised if we
lost.”’

Junior Joelle ‘‘Action’’ Jackson put
the Generals on the scoreboard first
with an unassisted goal at 15:16 re-
maining in the game. It took Hollins
only a 1:08 to tie the score when Dan-
dridge Keyser beat W&L goalie
Sherri Brown and, suddenly, it looked

like the Generals were suffering from’

the same problems that afflicted them
a year ago.

“It’s a real ‘mental’ thing for us to
play Hollins because they’re Hol-
lins,”’ said Hathorn, who thought that

Last Saturday, the harriers
grabbed second place in a four-
team meet. Running on their home
course, the Generals came
up a little short against Norfolk
State, losing 27-35. W&l fared bet-
ter against Roanoke, downing the

Leading the way was sophomore

fact might have caused the Generals to
allow the tying goal so quickly.

But that was then, and this is now.
On what was easily the best and
prettiest play of the afternoon, junior
Catherine Baillio took a corner kick
from freshman Ashley Gray and
headed it past the Hollins goalkeeper.
It would prove to be the game winner
for the Generals.

“As far as the header, that’s pretty
much the idea but it doesn’t always
happen,’’ said Hathorn. ‘‘We try to

get it to work. It’s a play we try to

run.

‘*[Gray] has one of the most accu-
rate shots. That's definitely one of our
plays because she is so good at it.””

She’s also not bad at scoring her
own goals. With under three minutes
left, Gray unleashed a powerful shot
that went off the hands of the goalie
and into the back of the net. With the
all-important insurance goal secured,
the Generals (4-5, 3-2 in the ODAC)
could relax somewhat and just run out
the clock.

WA&L played on the road last Satur-
day and lost a tough 6-0 game to high-
ly-ranked North Carolina Wesleyan.

‘This team is a great team,”” said
Hathorn. ‘‘I don’t see us losing unless
we're outplayed, as far as playing a
team that we’re equally matched
with.”’

The Generals will stay in Lexington
on Saturday to take on Sweet Briar.

travels to Lynchburg to play the Hor-
nets on Tuesday afternoon.

lona hot, polo not in N.E. Varsity Invitational

 

By Tom Wingfield
Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee’s water polo
team fell victim to one of the hottest
teams in the East last weekend at the
Northeast Varsity Invitational in
Providence, R.I. The Generals fin-
ished the weekend with two straight
wins, however, raising their record to
9-3.

After beating Iona in their last meet-
ing in Annapolis, the Generals came
out a little flat and fell behind 5-1 after
the first half and could never recover.
The final score was 10-5. Iona played,
without question, one of its best
games of the year against the Generals
and then went on to beat Bucknell in

“It’s third down and long for
Bridgewater College,’’ says the
commentator. ‘‘The quarterback
drops back, looks around and,oh
my, down he goes. What a hit! He
is thrown for a big loss on the sack
by number 61, Jimmy Johnson.”’

Just who is number 61, Jimmy
Johnson? No, he’s not the big-
- mouthed, slick-haired coach of
the Miami Hurricanes. He is senior
tri-captain on the Washington and
Lee football team. He also happens
to have been selected as The Ring-
tum Phi Athlete-of-the-Month for
the month of September. Johnson
recorded over ten tackles in each of
the first three games of the season
for the Generals.

J.J., as he is called by his
friends, stands 6’3‘* and weighs in
at 230 pounds. He is the anchor of
the defensive line and is leading the
team in tackles this season.

Against Randolph-Macon last
Saturday, he was in on seventeen

the semifinals of the tournament.

“It is kind of a mystery to me but
we were not up to par against Iona,”
said head coach Page Remillard. ‘“We
were playing low in the water. The
whole team had a bad game. Hopefu-
lly, this will be the only time it hap-
pens all season.”*

Remillard also said it was not a case
of the Generals tightening up because
of the pressure.

“I don’t think handling the pressure
is a problem,’ he said. ‘‘It’s just a
matter of developing a little contin-
uity. We were very sluggish against
Iona, and they kept our backs to the
wall the entire game.””

The Generals, who came into the
tournament ranked 17th in the nation,
bounced back from their first round

defeat to trounce a_ well-coached
M.I.T. squad 19-5. This set up a
meeting with Army for the third time
this year. It is always hard to beat the
Same team three times in one season
but the Generals rose to the occasion
and defeated Army 15-14 in double
overtime.

W&L was led by the strong perfor-
mance of senior David Reavy, who
contributed five goals and some great
play down the stretch. ‘‘Reavy took
control and played to win when it
counted,”’ said Remillard. Senior Da-
vid Deitz also contributed seven goals
to the victory.

Yellow Jackets quarterback Paul
Dillard. Against Centre College,
Johnson was in on close to fifteen
tackles.

What kind of an example does
Johnson set for his teammates?

‘‘Jimmy is definitely a leader by
example. He is a definite crazy
man, a monster on the field. His in-
tensity carries over to the other
players and makes them want to
compete at the same level he
does,’’ said freshmen Willie Hen-
derson and Jeff Kreis.

Said junior defensive lineman
Scott Silverman, ‘‘During the
game, Jimmy is the big play man.
When a big play needs to be made,
Jim Johnson steps to the forefront.
Every time I came off my block
and looked up, all I could see was
Johnson drilling the guy with the
ball.

Johnson hails from Atlanta, Ga.
and is a journalism major. He’s
been on the football team each of
his four years here and has lettered
each year. He says that the greatest
moment he has had over his career

| |[Athlete-of-the-Month

to secure a Division IH national
championship. W&L, currently ran-
ked second in D-H, will play both the
number one-ranked and number three-
ranked teams in the coun-
try—University of California at San
Diego and Claremont-Mudd-
Scripps—as well as Pomona-Pitzer in
the Claremont Invitational.

‘We can do a great deal for our
cause if we can sweep the California
trip,”’ said Remillard. ‘‘We can clinch
a D-III national title as well as im-
prove our position for Easterns. We
continue to hold our destiny in our
own hands. There are some teams that
find a way to win and some that find a
way to lose. We have to be one of
those teams that finds a way to win.”’

 

 

"Jim Johnson

was when the Generals tied for the
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
title during his freshman year.
‘‘What was so great was that we
won three games by a touchdown
or less. It was a tight race. It was
great the way we did it. Also, it
was the first winning team that I
had ever been on.”

 

 

Off the field, Johnson is not the
intense, big-hitting lineman that he
is on the field. In his free time, he
likes to go fishing as well as spend
time hanging around with his dog
Slug.

Congratulations to Jimmy

Cheaters are
never winners

Things were so much easier when you were a child. Think about it.
Homework consisted of cutting snowflakes out of white paper for the
Christmas play or making Mom that special Mother’s Day card. You
drank Kool-Aid by the bathtub-full, Toughskins were the fashion state-
ment and you weren't cool if you didn’t own a pair of puke-green Zips.

Your outlook on life was so much simpler too. What philosopher
could possibly argue with the theory of ‘‘finders keepers, losers
weepers’” or “‘never talk to strangers’’ or ‘‘I know what you are but
what am I?’ My favorite, however, was one my parents taught
me—‘‘cheaters never win.””

Ben Johnson cheated. And he didn’t win. Maybe, instead of bemoan-
ing the fact that Johnson took steroids and whining about the state of ath-
letics, we should be celebrating that Johnson was stripped of his gold
medal and banished from track and field. The system works—cheaters
never win. Well, maybe it’s not so simple after all.

The childhood idealogy doesn’t include the important phrase of ‘‘If
they get caught.’’ Despite all the money spent on drug testing at the
Olympics, it would be naive to say that all the winners were drug-free.
Two members of the Bulgaria weightlifting team cheated, got caught
and were stripped of their medals. The Bulgarians then proceeded to
pull the rest of their squad out of the competition, supposedly because of
embarrassment. Most people suspected, probably correctly, that the
Bulgarians thought they could beat the drug testing and when they
didn’t, realized that their remaining weightlifting competitors would all
test positive as well.

The technology of masking steroid use continues to be a step, albeit a
small one, ahead of drug testing technology. What of those who know
how to beat the system? Which makes me wonder: Who won because of
hard work and determination or who won due to better science? Steroids
have a valid medical use—they aid in the healing of torn or strained
muscles. But the steroid Johnson was on was being taken for more than
just the hamstring pull he suffered early this year.

It seems incredulous, but Johnson maintains that he did not knowingly
take steroids. Some sources speculate that Johnson has been taking ster-
oids for the past couple of years. Johnson’s personal physician, ---- As-
taphan, even bragged about being ‘‘responsible’’ for Johnson’s world-
record performance last fall at the World Championships in Rome. And
yet, Johnson continues to say he didn’t know what was going on. What
did Ben think he was taking? Aspirin? Vitamins?

Another question: Where does the athlete draw the fine line between
an ‘‘earned’’ victory and an ‘“‘assisted’’ one? How can any competitor
feel good about himself when he/she has had to cheat to win. The old
‘Everybody else is doing it, so why shouldn’t I?’’ saying just doesn’t
cut it any more. Carl Lewis, Kristen Otto, Matt Biondi and the other
gold medal winners didn’t use drugs.

Johnson’s life has been destroyed. He will probably never run compe-
titively again—but who really cares? Who know’s whether or not John-
son’s climb to the top of the men’s 100 meters was all brought about by
steroids?

As I said a couple of weeks ago, lucrative endorsements (read: mega-
bucks) can be had by Olympic champions. It’s ironic that the means
Johnson took to obtain those financial rewards, ended up costing him
everything he had gained so far.

There is no excuse for Ben Johnson. Fortunately for the Olympics and
sports in general, Johnson was caught. Mom and Dad were right in this
case—cheaters don't win.

NOTES-—Since I’m never right about these things, I’m going to ruin
every New York Mets fan entire winter. The Mets will win the World
Series in five games over the Oakland Athletics. How’s that for the
‘kiss of death?”’ All things considered, NBC did a nice job with its
Olympic coverage. Kudos especially to Marv Albert (boxing) and Char-
lie Jones (track). Lowlight of the Games had to be the U.S.-Soviet
Union basketball clash, Dick Enberg and Al McGwire were more em-
barrassing than the way the U.S. played. Would someone please inform
Enberg that it is ‘‘Bimbo’’ Coles and not Vernell.... Looking at the
games here in Lexington, the women’s athletic teams just keep getting
better and better. All three fall programs are off to fine starts, with the
volleyball team deserving special recognition for its inspired play, de-
spite being a first-year varsity program....

The Ring-tum Phi, October 6, 1988,

 

Again, Vienneau astounds chapel

By Margaret Pimblett
Staff Reporter

 

I exington concert-goers got a jump
on New York City this week when
Robert Vienneau, a W&L second-year
law student, gave a resoundingly suc
cessful piano concert in Lee Chapel
Tuesday evening

Vienneau presented a program of
nineteenth- and twentieth-century
compositions to a crowd which filled
the chapel to standing room only

He will play the same program in
New York City on October 24, in an
appearance sponsored by the W&l
New York alumni chapter and the
Canadian consulate. Vienneau is a
native of Montreal.

Each half of the concert, which
lasted an hour and a half with an
intermission, was well-balanced, with
a contemporary composition to begin,
slower melodic pieces in the middle,
and Liszt pieces showcasing Vien
neau’s virtuosity at the end

The evening began with George
Gérshwin's ‘‘Three Pre
ludes,*‘composed in 1926. These
three short pieces, influenced by the
jazz and popular music of the Twen-
ties, include much rhythmic variation
and syncopation. Vienneau handled
easily the intricacies of rhythm, and
was particularly impressive in the
second prelude, the slowest of the
three. He controlled the tempo and
meter well, resisting the temptation to
stretch certain notes to excessive sen-
timentalism within the blues-oriented
theme.

The middle section of the first half
included Chopin’s Ballade No. 1 in G
minor (1835) and Debussy’s Suite
Bergamasque (1905), including the
famous ‘‘Clair de Lune**. Vienneau
treated both with technical and inter-

pretive care, these two
Romantic compositions to be heard
free of maudlin banalities. The **Clait
de Lune” as exquisitely presented.

Vienneau concluded the first set
with Franz Liszt's ‘La Campanella,”
an energetic, highly-virtuosic work
which he played with hands flying and
fingers blurring. He was technically
amazing

After intermission, Vienneau
played a 1954 composition by Cana
dian Francois Morel, Deux Etudes de
Sonorite. The two-part piece consisted
of a slower opening section and a fast
close, *‘ Vif et Joyeux’’, with a driving
left hand which seemed almost to anti
cipate later rock music of the 1960's
and 70's.

Like the Gershwin, this piece had
much rhythmic complexity and syn-
copation. The piece was very accessi
ble contemporary music, although it
would never be confused with a
Beethoven piano sonata. Like many
performers of twentieth-century mu-
sic, Vienneau found it necessary to
use sheet music for this piece in order
to handle the contemporary rhythms
and melodies.

Rachmaninoff's Elegie in E-flat
minor (1892) was another late Roman
tic piece, allowing Vienneau to slow
down to a more lyrical, expressive
pace. This set the audience up perfec
tly for the final programmed selec
tion, Liszt’s Mephisto Waltz. As with
the first Liszt piece, Vienneau was
technically superb, with the opportun
ity to showcase his talent on a chal
lenging, fast-paced and_ highly
entertaining piece. The one difficulty
Vienneau faced during the Mephisto
was the small fly circling his head
while he played. He simply waved the
insect away, without missing a beat or
a note.

allowing

 

The audience gave a standing ova-
tion to bring Vienneau back for an en-
core, Robert Schumann's *‘Child Fall-
ing Asleep’’—a lullaby to pacify an
audience which wanted to hear even
more of Vienneau’s exceptional play-
ing. The piece was brief to the point of
abruptness, and was definitely too
short for some of the audience, who
kept applauding for some time after he
had finished

student, has given solo recitals annu-
ally since 1984, except for last year
(certainly excusable for a student be-
ginning a law education). He also has
accompanied university vocal groups,
including Southern Comfort, the Glee
Club and the University Chorus.

Lexington music lovers have be-
come accustomed to hearing perfor-
mances of exceptional merit whenever
Vienneau plays. Tuesday night’s con-
cert was a continuation of another fine
WAL tradition of excellence.

Clean & Sober disappoints; Betrayed disturbs

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

I was really beginning to wonder if
anyone was going to give Big Top
Pee-Wee a run for its money as worst
film of the year, but after seeing Clean
and Sober 1m not so worried any-
more.

Clean and Sober is simply the
year’s most disappointing film. Direc-
tor Glenn Gordon Caron begins the
film in documentary fashion in im-
pressive style but then sits by and wat-
ches it die. This film had all kinds of
potential for reaching out and making
a significant statement about drugs,
alcohol and the people who are addic-
ted to them. Unfortunately though, the
film weakens, gives in and dies just
like the addicts it attempts to follow.

Michael Keaton, who was hilarious
but shorted in his part in last year’s
Beetlejuice, is a gifted comic but
makes the same fatal mistake in Clean
and Sober that Bruce Willis did in

Poetics’

By Greg Ossi
Music Critic

I managed to listen to Stanley Jor-
dan and company play ‘‘Stairway to
Heaven”’ and never have a felt sorrier
for Plant, Page and the rest of
Zeppelin. The only thing that could
possibly beat this version out for
worst remake ever would be if the
London Philharmonic attempted it.

This is not a fusion song to be
played with sythesizers. Needless to
say if you can appreciate Led Zeppelin
even a little bit, stay away from this
song because it is horrible and will
only make you mad if you listen to it.

The Waxing Poetics have released a
new album entitled ‘*Manakin
Moon.** The Poetics are from Nor
folk, Virginia and have played at ‘‘the
Pit’’ and several fraternity houses in
town. This is their second album, fol-
lowing ‘‘Hermitage’’ which
released a little over a year and a half

 

was

Blind Date; that of acting outside his
forte.

As stated, Michael Keaton is a bril-
liant comic and has had great success
with parts in such films as Night Shift,
Mr. Mom and Beetlejuice. Note,
however, that Keaton’s successes
have come in comedies, every one.
Keaton gives an adequate perfor-
mance in the film, yet, he is not a
good enough dramatic actor to carry a
dragging film such as Clean and
Sober.

The film loses its potential by being
too simple. Drug Addiction and the
correction thereof carries many possi-
bilities for a quality film but the story
has to be more than problem-clinic-
b solution-have a nice life. After a
while therapy gets a little old; scratch
that, a lot old.

After so many promising previews
this summer, it’s very disappointing
that Clean and Sober couldn’t deliver.

ago.

With ‘‘Manakin Moon’’ they seem
to be moving in a different direction.
The playing is very solid but.... The
Poetics live sound comes from the
great rhythm and beat by drummer
Bill Shearin and bass player Sean
Hennessy. The drums are there but as
in their first album, Hennessy seems
to be lost in the mix. They also seem
to have abandoned their style of com-
bining ringing chords with melodic
leads. Instead they focus on the fuzz-
box and blistering leads.

The best song on the album *‘Baby
Jane’’ rocks. Even better, you can ac-
tually hear Hennessy, who is a very
talented bass player. If you buy the
album expecting more of the same you
may be disappointed.

**Downstairs’’ is
their old album. The fuzzbox is not so

On the flip side if there is one direc-
tor who knows how to make a film
about a controversial subject it is Con-
stantin Costa- Gavras.

The latest film from the mastermind
behind Zand Missing is Betrayed star-
ring Debra Winger and Tom
Berenger. Once again, Winger plays a
government agent, whose job this time
is to infiltrate a Klan-like group and
gather information on its leaders.
Berenger plays one of the leaders.

Betrayed isn’t great but is a good,
thought-provoking film that will make
you think. One scene in particular has
Berenger taking Winger out on ‘‘a
hunt,’” where members of Berenger’s
group kidnap a black man, let him go
in a heavily-wooded area and then
hunt him down like an animal.

If nothing else, Betrayed should
make you question what your defini-
tion of freedom is and whether or not
you think every person in this country
has it. If your answer is yes, in my
opinion, you're wrong.

Every person in the United States
technically has the same rights as any
other person, yet, it is scary to think
that someone’s rights can be stopped
when any other person thinks they
should be.

Many people will watch this film
and the anti-semetic and Ku Klux Klan
groups represented in the film and will
dismiss them as clinematic license.
They ‘re not.

They are realistic ahd dangerous
entities who believe they are a chosen
group. They believe they are Ameri-
cans before they are white supremi-
cists, yet they will say that someone
who is Jewish or black or homosexual
is that before they are American.

Betrayed is disturbing but a film that
anyone with a social conciousness
should see. It is beautifully directed,
well-filmed and well-acted. The end
gets tied up a little too fast, but for the
most part it is a quality film.

songs on the album also just seem to
be there with nothing substantial about

‘*Manakin Moon’’ is a mediocre
album by a very good band that will be
popular because it is by a hot local

elf study underway for re-accredidation

By Caly Smith
Staff Reporter

 

Self study committees, consisting of
faculty and students, are in the process
of ensuring re-accreditation of Wash-
ington and Lee University as outlined
in the Criteria Manual of the Southern
Association of Colleges and Schools
(SACS).

To be accredited, the university
must be evaluated every 10 years by a
visiting team. This year, instead of do-

ing a traditional self study, W&L is
conducting a long-range plan for the
future of the university.

According to Dean John Elrod,
‘‘Every department is involved in
planning for the future of this univer-
sity. The final strategy adopted should
last out through the end of this cen-
tury, covering a little more than 10
years.”

Dean Elrod said the faculty and stu-
dents are essentially responsible for
the planning. He said, ‘The strength
of this undertaking is not the president

and his administrators devising the
plan, but rather all of the faculty and a
number of students. The plan will be
as good as the imagination, time,
energy and hard thinking the faculty
and students give to it.”’

Specific plans for the next 10 years
are being developed in the following
areas: 1) Quality of faculty, 2) Quality
of student body (Admissions), 3)
Academic programs, 4) Campus life
and student services, 5) Freshman
year. 6) Institutional effectiveness, 7)

Administrative services, 8) The Law

School, 9) Physical facilities. The re-
ports by the faculty and students will
be given to the Long Range Planning
Steering Committee by March 30,
1989. The committee will evaluate the
area reports in April and May, and
then combine them into an institu-
tional report.

According to Dean Elrod, the report
will be reviewed and/or modified by
the Board of Trustees, turned in to the
SACS for W&L’s re-accreditation re-

-CRC debate: No finalized plans made

‘

 

By Stacy L. Morrison
Staff Reporter

Concerns about the circumstances
surrounding the formation of the Con-
fidential Review Committee, such as
the loss of student power and the need
for a body to hear sensitive cases,
were discussed last night in Lee
Chapel at the CRC forum.

Currently, the CRC has jurisdiction
over cases that involve sexual harass-
ment, racial, religious or sexual slurs
and cases of ‘‘unwanted sexual touch-
ing.’ The CRC was voted into exis-
tence by the faculty last Spring after
an hoc review committee ascertained
that there was a need for a body to
deal with cases requiring heightened
sensitivity and confidentiality.

The forum this week was to be an
informational session followed by a
question and answer period. ‘‘We
want your opinions about possible so-
lutions,’’ said EC President Christo-
pher deMovellan in his opening com-
ments.

‘‘We have some definite needs in
the student body that must be met, but
we also have a desire for self-
governance. We cannot sacrifice the
needs, for self-government,”’ said
deMovelian before opening the floor
for discussion.

No action was taken at the forum,
but points of concern were discussed
between the faculty, students and rep-
resentatives of the SCC, the EC and
the CRC.

The primary reason for the forma-
tion of the CRC is a need on the cam-

EC clarifies policies

By Stacy L. Morrison
Staff Reporter

 

The Executive Committee voted
at Monday night’s meeting to add a
statement to its plagiarism pamphlet
that clarifies a student's position when
working under a professor’s direc-
tives.

This action is in response to Journal-
ism Professor Hampden H. Smith’s
request for such a statement at an EC
meeting two weeks ago.

The statement will read, ‘‘For ex-
ample, where a student follows his or
her professor’s instructions on an as-
signment, the Honor System recog-
nizes that this pamphlet does not ap-
ply.”’

The revision will go under Section
E, ‘‘Specialized Assignments,’’ of the
plagiarism pamphlet, and will go into
effect immediately. The new state-
ment will go into the pamphlet at next
year’s printing.

EC Member Dave Nave drafted the
statement, and the EC voted 10-1-0
for the revision.

In other business, the EC received a
letter requesting that the EC look into
discontinuing the common practice of
posting bills on the colonnade because
they ‘‘deface’’ the colonnade. EC
President Christopher deMovellan
said, ‘‘Things need to be put up there
in an orderly fashion.’” EC Member
Mark Cobb will look into this matter
and report back to the EC next week.

Freshman class officer elections
will be held Monday. The EC
received 32 petitions from freshmen
interested in running for EC rep-
resentative, president and vice presi-
dent.

Nineteen students submitted peti-
tions for the freshman EC rep-
resentative position. The candidates
are: David S. Bohigian, Bryan Byrd,
Christopher Doherty, Mike Gray,
Karen Halsell, Gregory Hicks, Clay-
ton A. Kennington, Brant Martin,
Frank Martien, Paul M. Mazyck,
Trént Merchant, Mason L. Petit, Fred
Renneker, Clay Thomas, William
Edwin Thomas Jr., Jamie Tucker,
Elizabeth Vallotton, Kim Wolf and
Monica L. Young.

The seven candidates for freshman
class president are: Evan Balmer, Ted
Eades, Scott Goodman, Willie L
Henderson Jr., Will Jones, Brad Mar-
tin and Blaire Postman

Five freshmen are vying for the vice

pus for a committee to hear sensitive

issues concerning sexual and ethnic
harassment and violation. Last year
there were 14 such cases that did not
go before the SCC. Associate Dean of
Students Anne C. Schroer-Lamont
said that victims she dealt with last
year said they would not feel comfor-
table going to the SCC. Schroer-
Lamont spoke with three of these vic-
tims this year, who said they would
have taken their case to the CRC as
the committee exists now.

Several suggestions have been
fielded for alternate committees to the
CRC. The EC plans to submit a pro-
posal to the faculty for a committee
composed of two faculty members,
three SCC members and two students-
at-large. The SCC wants to form a
sub-committee of their committee to
handle sensitive cases. Another option
that has been discussed is to change
the ratio @f faculty-students of the
CRC from four-three to three-four.

The SCC has definite plans to add a
confidentiality clause to its guidelines,
said Burns, who suggested that the
size of the SCC, thirteen members,
can be seen as a negative when con-
sidering confidentiality.

Schroer-Lamont is not sure that an
SCC sub-committee would solve any
problems. ‘‘All of us are aware that
we have a problem of homophobia on
this campus. It is intimidating for a
gay, or a lesbian, to bring a case like
this before his peers,’’ Schroer-
Lamont said.

The SCC is composed of very visi-
ble students on campus. The president
and vice-president of each class serve

presidential position: Fred Elliott,
John Flippen, Lance Merryweather,
David Phillips and Gene Pridi.

Each of the candidates was required
to make a one-minute speech at Lee
Chapel Wednesday afternoon. Run-
off elections will be held the Thursday
following primary elections.

In EC budget news, two campus or-
ganizations presented their budget
requests at Monday night’s EC meet-
ing. The soccer club, a new organiza-
tion, requested $2,243 to go toward
the purchase of equipment and uni-
forms.

Sophomore Michael Danzansky,
vice president-treasurer of the club,
said that if uniforms were removed
from the budget, the amount of money
needed would drop to $763. The EC
awarded $500 to the club.

Mock Convention Co-Chairman
John Symonds requested $2,000 for
Mock Convention this year. The EC
asked to see a statement of the Mock
Convention’s bank account standing at
the end of last year before making a
decision. Symonds will report back to
the EC next Monday night.

President deMovellan will meet
with the Board of Trustees on the
weekend of Oct. 21. DeMovellan will
ask the board for vans for the new
Live Drive program. Any other sug-
gestions for requests should go to de-
Movellan or another EC member,
deMovellan said.

All members of the EC were present
and on time. The meeting lasted 35
minutes.

In the executive session following
the meeting, the EC appointed the fol-
lowing students to faculty subcommit-
tees:

Athletic Committee: John Carberry,
Vanessa Hartman and Kenon White-
hall.

Scheduling committee:

on the SCC. Junior Jill Westphal said
that discussing something ‘‘so serious-
ly personal’ to the SCC and then see-
ing that person in class could be un-
nerving. Westphal said, ‘‘Even
though you can change the formation
of the SCC, I don’t think you can

change the[student’s] perception of

the SCC.”’

Many students do not want to see
the power taken away from the SCC
because they see that move as a break-
down of the student-run campus. So-
ciology Professor David R. Novack,
who served on the ad hoc review
committee, said ‘‘Our primary con-
cern [on the ad hoc review committee]
was not the issue of self-
government.’’ Novack said they wan-
ted to help those students who did not
have confidence in a student commit-

Staff Report

 

Three Washington and Lee Univer-
sity students’ cases were heard before
the Rockbridge County Circuit Court
last week.

Harmon Harden of Winter Park,
Fla., was sentenced to 30 days in jail
and a $500 fine after being found gui-
Ity of a class one misdemeanor for the
possession of marijuana.

A motion was granted by the court
to strike the charge of manufacturing
or possessing marijuana with the in-
tent to manufacture the same, not for
his own use.

David Alden Shaw of Easton, Md.,
pleaded guilty to a class one mis-
demeanor for the possession of mari-
juana and was placed on first offender
status as part of probation for an un-
disclosed period of time. That was
after passing a drug test ordered by the
court.

Commonwealth’s Attorney Eric L.
Sisler chose not to prosecute the in-
dictment for possession of cocaine
(nol. pros.).

All charges against Carey Ferguson
Garst of Boones Mill, Va., were dis-
missed for lack of evidence.

It is the policy of the Board of

Trustees that students who are facing
charges in felony cases_ will not have

 

their degrees considered and thus their
diplomas will be withheld. With these
cases coming to their conclusion, the
matter of three diplomas comes to the
forefront.

According to J.W. Elrod, Dean of
the College, there is no set policy, but
the Board of Trustees will make one
for the Catalog Issue of Washington
and Lee University at its October
meeting.

‘The university takes any disciplin-
ary action it sees fit only after the
court has adjudicated the cases,’’ said
Elrod.

Elrod explained that after the stu-
dent has paid his debt to society, then
it is the responsibility of the faculty to
vote whether or not the degree should
be conferred by the Board of Trustees.
The last step after that is the final con-
sideration by the Board.

port, and then used as a basis for a
capital campaign. Elrod said, ‘‘The
fund raising campaign, hopefully be-
ginning in 1990, will be needed to
raise money to pay for the new pro-
grams recommended in the long range
plan report.’

Washington and Lee was given
permission by the SACS to do the
long-range plan in lieu of the custo-
mary self study report in order to plan
the school’s future for the next 10
years. The evaluation officially began
this summer. and the final report will

be written by May 30, 1989, Elrod
said.

People involved in the planning said
some recommendations that may
come forward in the area reports are
one or two more buildings, more fa
culty, increased computing power for
faculty, more financial aid for needy
and meritorious students, a few new
interdisciplinary academic programs,
more research and instructional lab
space, and greater opportunities for
study abroad.

 

Former Virginia Governor Chuck Robb.

Charles S. Robb, the former gov-
ernor of Virginia, stressed the impor-
tance of the social and economic situa-
tion in America in a stump speech
Monday in Lee Chapel.

“The subject of the social and
economic situation in America has
been a subject shoved on the back
burner of political debate. I think it be-
longs at the top of our agenda,’’ Robb
said in his speech, which was the first
of eight in a series sponsored by Con-
tact, an organization at W&L that
pays speakers to address W&L and the
Lexington community.

Robb, who is running for the U.S.
Senate as a Virginia Democrat, said
the chief dilemma now in our country
is a growing social isolation of the
underclass in our society.

Robb said, ‘“The government needs
purposeful leadership and common ac-
tion. We need to recast social policies
in the light of 25 years experience,...
to combat this problem.”’

He said, ‘‘The government needs to

U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor will be speaking in Lee Chapel
Thursday, October 20, as a part of the Otey lecture series.

We have to let them know we care
what happens to them and we'll help

Robb proposed several ways to be-
gin this process, including early inter-
vention, expanded prenatal care, pub-
lic/private cooperation and public
safety. He also emphasized creating
new opportunities for young Ameri-
cans to serve their country.

After Rob’s speech, his wife, Linda
Robb, reiterated her husband’s asser
tions. ‘‘We all need to feel we are
making a contribution to society, do
ing something for others,’” she said.

Robb, who has an honorary degree
from ‘W&L and has spoken at the
school three times in the last four
years, was governor of Virginia from

1982-1985.

Robb’s Republican opponent for the
Senate seat, Maurice A. Dawkins,
also was invited by Contact to speak at
WaL.

Robert K. Tompkins, a member of
Contact, said Dawkins will be north of
Lexington at the McCormick Farm on
Oct. 18 and has been invited to speak
at W&L that afternoon or evening. ‘‘It
has been fairly difficult to schedule
and we have not received an answer
from Dawkins yet,’’ Tompkins said.

According to Tompkins, the two
candidates were originally asked by
Contact to have a debate at W&L, but
both refused. *‘Robb called back later
and asked if he could speak,’’ Tomp
kins said. According to Tompkins,
this is why Contact sponsored Robb’s
speech and will sponsor Dawkins’ if
possible. He added that neither candi
date is getting paid for speaking as is
Contact’s usual procedure.

Dean John W. Elrod, acting presi
dent of W&L, said of Robb’s speech,
“It was a relief from negative cam
paigning. It’s the first positive politi
cal speech we've heard.’

OPINION

Environment

The life of every human being hinges on an ability to acquire
food, water, and oxygen. Sex, companionship, comfort and any
other human needs or activities are subordinate to the need for food,
water, and oxygen. Immersed in the bustle of daily life, most Amer-
icans take it for granted that they, will have easy access to those
three vital necessities. But humanity is in the process of destroying
the very resources that make it possible to eat, drink and breathe.
By destroying the environment, the human race is destroying itself.

Every aspect of the environment is part of an inter-related
system. Pollution in the Pacific Ocean can influence the number of
salmon a bear on a river in Oregon catches. A change in one part of
the environment causes a chain reaction. If the atmosphere becomes
super-saturated with carbon dioxide, forests will dry out and die.
The ocean will heat up and rise, and fertile land in areas like the
Midwest will be too dry to grow crops.

Pollution, the greenhouse effect, acid rain and other human- de-
rived environmental problems are changing the course of nature.
Before we know the full repercussions of our industrial activities,
there may be no more clean air, no more fertile land, and too many
extinct species of animals to heal the damage done to the envir-
onment. The prevention of such environmental tragedy calls for
concerted effort by all the nations of the world. —

At this point, environmental solutions are sill available, even for
huge problems like the increased amount of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere. It is this carbon dioxide that is causing global warming

known as the greenhouse effect. Fortune Magazine reports that the
Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee estimates that the en-
tire greenhouse effect could be stopped by planting 1.7 billion acres
of Sycamore trees, which are particularly adept at absorbing car-
bon. Nations also can help by finding energy alternatives other than
fossil fuels. Burning the fossil fuels is the main source of atmo-

spheric carbon dioxide.

MY VIEW

By Damon Fensterman

 

America has reached the pre-
pubescent stage of politics: the age of
the one liner. The current presidential
campaign, more than any other, rep-
resents the monolithic importance of
the mass media in mass politics. It has
been said that in this decade, the
single most effective source of cam-
paign media coverage is not political
advertisements, but appearances on
television news programs. And few
would dispute that claim. After all,
this is the year when the term ‘‘sound
bite’’ became a household phrase, and
when the political observation of the
week was: ‘‘That answer was about as
clear as the Boston Harbor.”

But it would be a waste of time to
belabor the issue of candidates using
one liners rather than substantive dis-

less knowledge thereof. And _poli- ,
ticians, though not necessarily more ¢

dishonest than ever before, are cer-

cussions of real issues to reach the
American electorate. The topic has
already elicited many stacks of printed
page.

The salient point is this: although
Americans might accuse 1988's poli-
ticians for being shallow, short-
sighted, and simplistic in their politi-
cal pitches, it isn’t the fault of the can-
didates. It isn’t even the fault of their
high-powered media staffs. Rather,
the blame lies on the American peo-
ple.

Americans are the ones who buy the
empty political rhetoric. They are the
ones who cheer the adolescent
exchange of one- liners. And they are
the ones who are so politically ignor-
ant that their vote might be swayed by
how a candidate looks on television.

And while both candidates have

dates are very much in touch with
America if they emphasize such shal-
low methods of communication as I’-
ve mentioned. Whatever else the
“‘mainstream of America’’ is, it’s pol-
itically ignorant. And mass media
have given candidates the tool to tap
that ignorance.

Obviously, rhetoric has always had
a place in American politics. Candi-
dates have never been totally honest
with the electorate. And from Day
One, the electorate has had considera-
bly less-than-total control over what
transpires in government. However,
those two forces have balanced each
other.

Yet, in the 80s, we’re beginning to
see that balance slip, While Ameri-
cans gain more and more control over
the government, they possess less and

tainly not required to be honest. Poli- *
ticians are only required to be suave «
and impressive. They have to ‘look
presidential,’’ not BE presidential.

It’s about time for America to wake ,
up. The ‘‘compact of government’
completely falls apart when the people *
don’t even know what their govern- |
ment does. We live in a country where
the citizens entrusted all power to the
government, and then put it on autopi-
lot. That’s hardly the sort of political
savvy that enables ME to sleep easily »
at night.

on past presidencies

Kirk also theorized that the long-term
drift of the U.S. government has been
towards increased concentration of
power.

While describing the presidency,
Kirk referred to Caesarism. Kirk said
that Caesarism arrived in the execu-
tive office with Lyndon B. Johnson.
Kirk said, ‘‘Johnson never lacked
nerve.”

Eugene McCarthy also was a cen-
tral figure in Kirk’s speech. As a
prominent political figure during the
1950s-70s, McCarthy, to Kirk, was a
“poet as a_ politician.’’ Through
McCarthy's opinion, Kirk described
John F. Kennedy. He said, ‘‘Eugene
McCarthy denied that either Jack
Kennedy nor his family brought mean-
ing to the American public.”’

The first president to speak of
American decadence, according to
Kirk, was Richard Nixon. When

Nixon asked Kirk if Americans had
any hope, Kirk: replied, ‘‘That de-
pends on popular belief.’ For, Rus-
sell Kirk believes the public will fol-
low the contemporary prophets.

After what Kirk describes as the
“‘quasi-populous Carter,’’ came the
““Western-hero”’ president — Reagan.
Kirk said Reagan has had to wear a
mask throughout his administration,
although he has executed his position
as ‘‘a man of great courage.”

Kirk also said that the president to-
day is ‘‘responsible for everything.”’
The concentration on television de-
bates, advertising and campaigns has
led to a ‘‘publicitary democracy.”’
However, Kirk gave a glimmer of
hope concerning America when he
compared the nation to the Byzantine
Empire. ‘‘A period of decay may lead
to a period of progress.’’ The deca-
dence Nixon first spoke of may not
last.

the victim of ruthless physical abuse.

“Although the play deals with a deeply

By John Vittori
Staff Reporter

 

I entered the offices of the Lex-
ington Downtown Development As-
sociation (LDDA), preparing myself
for a brief interview I had arranged
with LDDA Executive Director Diane
Herrick. Instead, I was greeted with
three cartons of stuffed envelopes and
a plea of help from my interviewee to
take my share downstairs. After com-
pleting the interview, I realized I had
gotten a little taste of how the LDDA
functions — through the help of
everyone in the community.

The idea for the LDDA began when
the Historic Lexington Foundation
and the Lexington-Rockbridge County
Chamber of Commerce sponsored a
video conference about the national
Main Street Program in the fall of
1984 at Washington and Lee Univer-
sity, Herrick said. LDDA received its
national charter in April 1985, and in
1987 became an official Virginia main
street city. There currently are 10

such cities in the state and more than
350 in the country, Herrick said.

The LDDA functions on a four-part
program. Herrick said the four parts
are: organization, design, economic
restructuring and promotion. The Or-
ganization Committee establishes a
partnership of all the businesses that
are members of the LDDA. The De-
sign Committee works to enhance the
appearance of downtown Lexipgton.
The Economic Restructuring Cammit-
tee tries to help businesses financially
by establishing, for example, low in-
terest renovation loan programs. And
the Promotions Committee holds
events throughout the year, such as
Downtown Week, Student Bags for
incoming students at W&L, Virginia
Military Institute and Southern Sem-
inary College, and President’s Birth-
day Sales.

Herrick said technical assistants are
hired to help each city. She described
Lexington’s technical assistant as
‘*most beneficial.’’ Herrick said her
own job mainly is to contact the
stores. She said, ‘‘My role is as a

last year, were to have reported back
to their respective committees to field
comments and suggestions.

SCC Chairman David Burns said

‘The problem was that Mike Henry
did not consult the committee.”’
Henry told the ad hoc review commit-
tee that the ‘‘SCC did not feel comfor-
table with those kinds of cases.”’

Senior EC Representative John
McDonough said, ‘‘It seems like the
decision[{to form the CRC] was made
on a casual basis.’’ No formal guide-
lines were written for the CRC before
its formation, and procedures have yet
to be defined. McDonough questioned
how the ad hoc review committee
could form the CRC without first de-
ciding what the new committee should
have power to do.

Kozak said, ‘‘I think it was beyond

the commission of the ad hoc review
committee to make the guidelines [for
the CRC].’’ Kozak said the CRC is
working on procedures, and expects
to have them ready for approval by the
end of the month.

Law Professor Johnson said, ‘You
don’t adapt detailed procedures before
the committee has been approved.’’
Johnson said he thinks it is early to be
considering changes from the CRC,
since the CRC ‘‘has not had a chance
to operate.”’

Third-Year Law EC Representative
Dave Nave said, ‘‘People really just
don’t know what the CRC will be able
to do.’’ Nave asked for ‘‘clarification
on the substance of the policy,’’ as
soon as possible, to clear up confu-
sion.

Kozak said, ‘‘We’re working as
quickly as we can.”’

The EC will submit its alternate
committee proposal to the faculty at its
next meeting on Monday, Nov. 17.

ground of information (out there).

She said Lexington is geared to
serve three markets: tourist, local and

ing.

 

Herrick said the LDDA receives no
funding from the state. She said it de-

Flea market can offer
many nostalgic items

By L. Joelle Jackson
Staff Reporter

 

If you are looking for great bargains
and interesting conversation, Lexing-
ton’s Flea Market is the place for you.
Located on Va. 631 about ‘miles
west of East Lexington, this Flea
Market is a true piece of Lexington
nostalgia. It has been in operation for
13 years, and is now at its second loca-
tion.

The market has three dealers; Carl
and Ruby Blackwell Sr., Carl Black-
well Jr., and William O’Connor each
operate their own sections. The
Blackwells are native Virginians and
have been residents of Lexington for
many years; O’Connor is from New
Jersey. O’Connor states that at the
point of retirement, he and his wife
wanted to move somewhere other than
New Jersey, and, while he wanted to
move to Ireland, his wife wanted to
move to Virginia. ‘‘So,’’ he said,
‘*We compromised and moved to Vir-
ginia.”’

The Flea Market is more of a hobby
than anything else to them. Blackwell
explains that their prices are so low
because their joy comes more from
the actual buying and selling than re-
ceiving a large profit. Most of their
merchandise comes from yard sales
and auctions and is re-sold at virtually
the same cost for which they bought it.

‘‘T have some things I sell for $20,”’
Blackwell states, ‘‘that if I he!d onto, I
could eventually get $65 for, but that
would mean that I couldn’t keep buy-
ing things.”’

Out of Blackwell's favorite items is
a cash register from a filling station
where he went as a child ‘‘to buy ice
cream in little dixie cups for 5 cents’’;
it retails in the books for almost $900.
Another interesting item is a true
piece of Lexington memorabilia. Car!
Blackwell Jr. owns a scale that gives a
fortune. It used to sit in front of the
Lexington five-and-dime-store on
Main Street where Lexington Hard-
ware is now located.

Mr. Blackwell Jr. demonstrated by
placing a penny in the slot of the
month of his birth and stepping on the
scale. While he did not reveal his
weight, his fortune stated that ‘*You
dodge trouble by laughing it off.”’

Among the thousands of pieces of
merchandise, some other items of in-
terest include a wind-up Victrola
complete with records, brass arm and
brass needle-holder, an adding
machine from the 1920s, a Model T
jack, a wagon wheel wrench, an old-
fashioned wooden ice box, and defin-
itely the strangest item, a mechanism
used to give medicine to a horse. The
best sellers, according to Blackwell,
are the Coca Cola items.

Blackwell says that they have had
patrons from all over the United States
and Canada; however, a large part of
their business comes from Washing-
ton and Lee University.

The Flea Market would like to say
thank you to Washington and Lee and
invites everyone to come in and
browse around,’’ Blackwell says.

Morgan, visiting prof, poet
signed copies of Parties

 

By Laura Dodge
Staff Reporter

 

“*T want that book!”’ cried a woman,
rising out of her seat at a poetry read-
ing in Virginia in 1987. The woman
was a publisher from Louisiana State
University, the reader was Elizabeth
Seydel Morgan. Within a year, Miss
Morgan’s collection of poems, now
entitled Parties, was published by
Louisiana State University.

Parties is Elizabeth Morgan’s first
publication. She has worked on the
poems over a number of years. Mor-
gan wrote Parties as her thesis project
tg obtain her Master of Fine Arts De-
gree at Virginia Commonwealth Uni-

Gettier

versity in Richmond. David Smith, a
professor at Virginia Commonwealth,
worked on Morgan’s thesis, Parties,
as her thesis director. According to
Morgan, he helped her to revise the
collection ‘‘extensively.”’

Morgan teaches English at St. Cath-
erine’s School in Richmond. She also
has taught a few English courses as a
visiting professor at Washington and
Lee, occasionally giving speeches and
poetry reading at Washington and Lee
and Virginia Military Institute.

The collection of poems is divided
into two sections: ‘“The Party Before
the Party,’’ and ‘‘The Party.’’ The
sections begin with poems of the same
titles. According to the review on the

and celebration intertwine, and joy
remains the subtext of the deepest
pain.”’

Miss Morgan said it was ‘‘very ex-

citing’’ to have a listener at her read-
ing interrupt her and cry out ‘‘I want
that book.’’ Elizabeth Morgan had not
even begun to try and have her poems
published.

Miss Morgan autographed both

hardcover and paperback copies of
Parties from 3 to 4 p.m. Thursday,
Oct. 8, in the Washington and Lee
bookstore. Although she was occupied
signing books the entire hour, she
stated, ‘‘I did want to say that I never

Freshman Ashley Gray makes a move past a defender in action

against Hollins last week.

Football shuts down Scots

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

Gary Fallon became the winningest
football coach in W&L history Satur-
day, and he did it with an exclamation
mark, as the Generals rolled to a 20-0
victory over Maryville and their first
shutout in nearly a decade.

Fallon’s 49 wins in 11 seasons at
W&L are balanced by an equal num-
ber of losses, but his teams can still
boast more victories than those coa-
ched by Lee McLaughlin, whose
Generals won two Southern Confer-
ence titles, a College Athletic Confer-
ence Championship and one small-
college national title.

But Fallon, as usual, was reluctant
to take credit for his successes

“It's a credit to the staff and the
kids,’’ he said. ‘‘If I stay around long
enough, I'll probably have the record
for the most losses, too.”’

Although the final score wasn’t
even close, the game didn’t begin as a
blowout. After receiving the opening
kickoff, the W&L offense stalled, and
senior Tom Skeen came on to punt.
The snap from center sailed over
Skeen’s head, and Maryville took
over at the W&L 11.

But the defense held for the Gen-
erals, and senior tackle Jim Johnson
blocked a low field goal attempt on
fourth down.

The first play of the next series — a
4-yard gain on a sweep by Mason
Pope — was only the sophomore tail-
back’s eighth carry of the season. But
Pope would go on to play the game of
his career. W&L ran 71 offensive
plays Saturday, and Pope carried the
football on 30 of them; W&L gained
360 yards Saturday, and Pope rushed
for 163 of them.

Pope scored five plays into that
first-quarter drive, but a holding pen-

The Hampden-Sydney Tigers
have never lost a W&L homecom-
ing game, and the Generals, to use
one of coach Gary Fallon’s
favorite phrases, ‘‘will have their
hands full’’ in trying to end that
streak Saturday afternoon on Wil-
son Field.

The Tigers, 3-2 overall and 1-1
in the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference, are coming off a tough
21-14 fourth-quarter loss to Emory
& Henry.

Against the Wasps, Hampden-
Sydney scored first on an 11-yard

Armstrong (5-8, 145). But Fallon

 

alty brought back the touchdown and
changed a 35-yard scoring run into a
20-yard carry that gave W&L first and
goal from the 15. Sophomore Carter
Quayle kicked a 25-yard field goal
that capped a 9-play, 73-yard drive,
and W&L took a 3-0 lead.

The second quarter began with the
Scots driving. But four straight tackles
by Johnson — including a huge hit on
fourth and one at the W&L 13 —

is more concerned about the two
Tigers that combined for Sydney’s

completed 77 of 163 passes for

ond in the ODAC.

Water polo crams for West Coast exam

 

By Tom Wingfield
Staff Reporter

 

Exams at Washington and Lee are not scheduled
until the middle of December. This weekend the
W&L water polo team heads West for an early set
of examinations where they will play three of the
top 20 teams in the nation. W&L will face Clare
mont University on Friday and the University of
California at San Diego and Pomona-Pitzer on Sat-
urday. UCSD is ranked 10th in the nation; Clare-
mont 19th and Pomona 20th. The Generals are cur-

rently ranked 18th.

This trip is the first of its kind for the Generals’
polo team and is one that acknowledges Washington
and Lee’s water advancement into the upper
echelon of polo in the United States. There will be
11 players representing the team on the trip, a de-
cision that came very hard for head coach Page

Remillard.

“*My policies are not to cut players who try out
for the team,”’ he said. ‘‘I am not used to having to
go through the difficulties of saying ‘no’ to a young
man. I don’t think either the team or myself was

calloused to this type of decision.”’

From Staff Reports

 

The W&L women’s soccer team
went 1-1 over the past week. The
Generals notched a 3-2, come-
from-behind victory over Sweet
Briar Saturday. Freshmen Ashley
Gray and Morgan Warner and
senior Tracy Williams scored for
W&L. The Generals’ record,
however, fell to 5-6 on the season
when the team lost to Lynchburg
1-0 on Tuesday.

The Generals have a full slate of
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
action this week. W&L plays Ran-
dolph-Macon Woman's College in
Lynchburg today and plays host to
Randolph-Macon on Saturday.

The W&L men’s cross country
team went out of town for a meet,
and the W&L women’s team
stayed in town, but both teams had
tough days on Saturday.

The men traveled to Washing-
ton, D.C. for a tri-meet with Cath-
olic University and Lynchburg.
W&L finished both the host team
and the ODAC-rival Hornets. The
final tally had Catholic at 31,

to 3-3.

The W&L women fared a little
better than their counterparts.
Sophomore Paige Cason finished
first and freshman Cecily Tynan
was third win W&L’s tri-meet with
Lynchburg and Mary Baldwin in
Lexington. Cason’s time was
21:49, while Tynan finished
W&L’s 3.1-mile course in a time
of 22:30. Lynchburg finished first
in the meet, with W&L second and
Mary Baldwin third.

Both men’s and women’s teams
compete in the Virginia State Meet
in Charlottesville on Saturday. The
men’s race begins at 10 a.m. while
the women’s race starts at 11 a.m.

 

The W&L women’s volleyball
team suffered two ODAC losses
over the past week. Last Thursday,
the Generals traveled to Salem to
play Roanoke and ended up on the
short end of a five- setter. The
Maroons handed W&L a tough
loss, 10-15, 15-8, 15-12, 10-15,
15-10. On Tuesday in the Warner
Center, W&L lost to Eastern Men-
nonite 15-3, 15-6, 15-1 but
defeated Mary Washington 15-7,
15-4.

Remillard’s decision rested on who he felt had
the most experience and ability to accomplish what
the Generals are trying to do on this trip. Ten of the
11 players have had experience in California water

‘This team is a type of California connection that
is looking to go back to the West coast to play with
W&L pride,’’ said Remillard. ‘‘They want to de-
monstrate that non-California water polo can be

Remillard also is looking at this trip as a chance
to impress some potential recruits. ‘‘There will be a
lot of high school players at these games who will
have a chance to see an excellent East Coast school

Despite the importance of this trip in terms of the
athletic standpoint, this will be a cultural experi-
ence for the players as well. The schools the Gen-
erals are playing are very similar to W&L, with
impressive academic standards.

‘*The players at these schools come from similar
backgrounds as our guys do. They go to school to
study first and play water polo second,”’ said Re-

Remillard is looking forward to this trip because
it will be a type of homecoming for him. He left

Claremont to come to Washington and Lee 10 years
ago. ‘‘I am going to California with great pride. I
want to show my friends that what I’ve been doing
back East for 10 years has paid off. I am extremely

proud of this team of young men,”’ he said.

Obvious selections for the West Coast team are
two of the seniors, David Reavy and David Dietz.
The Generals will need strong performances from
both of these players at the offensive and defensive

ends of the pool if they hope to do well. Both of

these students have played polo in California and
therefore know what to expect.

‘There is a higher quality of game out West. The
officiating is at a higher level. If you can play with

the teams in the West, then you can play anywhere

in the country,’’ said Dietz.

It is important for us to play well and gain confi-
dence for the Southern League Championships and
Easterns,’’ commented Reavy. /

The Generals are on a mission on this trip — to
prove they can play as well as the West Coast
teams. They feel they need to win their game
against Pomona and they have a 50-50 chance of

beating Claremont. If the Generals can beat UCSD,

they will have passed their exam with flying colors
and will more than likely receive an At.

Missed opportunities hurt men’s soccer in loss to Averett

 

By Jay Plotkin
Staff Reporter

 

It all started well on Tuesday after-
noon for the Washington and Lee
men’s soccer team.

Coming off a forfeit win over Mar-
ymount College, freshman David de
Falco scored a goal five minutes into
the game against Averett College.
After that however, it was all Averett,
as they caught and pulled away from
the Generals, winning the game 3-1.
The loss dropped the Generals to 5-4,
2-1 in the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference

The Generals had won three out of
their last four games, including the
3-0 domination of arch-rival Hamp-
den-Sydney, coming into the Averett
game, yet looked nothing like a team
that was starting to put the pieces

together.

‘*We just weren’t on top of our
game,’’ said junior half- back Patrick
Brown.

‘‘We had our lapses. There were
times when we played well,’’ said
senior co-captain Mike Veliuona.
‘*We just couldn’t put the ball in the
back of the net. We must have hit the
post four or five times. [Senior for-
ward]|Johnny Sarber had lots of chan-
ces. We just couldn’t capitalize on
them. We played decent, but no where
near the level we are capable of."’

‘*T had a lot of chances to score,”’
said Sarber. ‘*I must have hit the post
three or four times myself, and the
team hit the post five or six times. It
was frustrating. I think we picked up
the tempo of the game in the second
half, but we couldn’t put the ball in the
goal. Some first half let-downs came
back to haunt us.

**Averett has always been an up and
down team. We beat them pretty
soundly last year, but they always
seem to have a good team,”’ he said.

Some players thought the Generals
should have won the game. ‘‘I think
we should have won,’’ said Brown.
‘*We had more potential than they did
to win. We were just unlucky. We
couldn’t seem to put the ball in the
net."

Looking down the road toward the
end of the season, the Generals have a
tough schedule to contend with. Ac-
cording to Veliuona, the team must
play at the level it did against Hamp-
den- Sydney if it wants to reach its
goal of a 10-win season and an ODAC
title.

‘We have a hard schedule left to
play, and looking back, Averett was

probably going to be the easiest game.
There are going to be no easy games
the rest of the way, and we need to
play like we did against H-SC. It will
take good ball[playing] to win 10
games.””

Sarber summed up what lies ahead
for the team. ‘‘Every game is tough,
but foremost on our list is to pull
together and play as a unit. Every
game is going to be a struggle. We've
played our best when we played as a
unit. We’ve set a tough goal for our-
selves, and we'll have to be pumped
up to play every game. The last
ODAC game will decide the cham-
pionship, and I think we’re ready for
it. It is going to be interesting.”’

The Generals take on Guilford Fri-
day at 3:30 p.m. on the Liberty Hall
Fields. W&L then travels to Mary
Washington on Wednesday.

Come in out
of the cold

The following dialogue came from one of the recent Mets/Dodgers
playoff games at Shea Stadium in New York City.

‘*What do youse guys think the Mets’ chances are?’’ said Tony Beer-
gutini to a couple of his cronies. *‘Do youse think we have a chance to
win the Series?”’

“I don’t (expletive) know,’’ said Ralph Metstein, ‘‘but I do know that
it’s (expletive) cold. I’m going to lose my (expletive) fingers and toes
because of (expletive) frostbite!”’

‘‘Ditto, what he (expletive) said,’’ said Vinnie Cretininski. ‘‘It’s too
(expletive) cold! Pass me the (expletive) rum and hot chocolate.”’

Despite their foul language and bad grammar, these Mets fans are ab-
solutely right. Baseball has no business being played this late in the
year. Does anybody out there really care? Unless you are a devout fan of
one of the teams playing, I’m sure most of you are watching college and
pro football by now. The World Series, known as ‘“The Fall Classic,”’
has become extremely tedious.

Sure, I’ll watch some of the action, but what’s there to watch? I get to
see Wade Boggs, wrapped up in 20 undershirts and four pairs of long
underwear, swing a bat like the Michelin marshmallow man (that’s what
it sometimes looks like). This year baseball got lucky with both teams
coming from the West Coast, but normally this isn’t the case.

Baseball is a game tailor-made for the hot lazy days and nights of
summer. Baseball means sweat, humidity, suntans and ice-cold
lemonade, beer and soda. It does not mean wind-chill factors, numb feet
and hands and thermoses of hot chocolate or coffee. The only ice that
should be seen is the ice used to fill your cooler with, not icicles hanging
from the tops of gates and doorways at the stadiums.

People wonder why some players don’t perform well in the
playoffs—it’s not the pressure but the cold. Hitting a baseball in sub-
zero temperatures is not fun. It hurts if you don’t catch the ball with the
sweet part of the bat. And what about pitchers going to their mouths?
That’s because if they didn’t their hand would freeze solid. Ever try
throwing a baseball with fingers that can’t move?

The solution is simple. Make the season shorter. Cut out all of Sep-
tember and half of August from the schedule. More than half of the
teams in majors are already out to the race by mid July. Instead of mak-
ing their fans suffer for another 2/2months, mercifully end the suffer-
ing. Think how many Orioles and Braves fans will be relieved. I mean,
is there anything in this world less meaningful than a Braves/Phillies
game in late August? By making the season a 100 games or so, the pen-
nant races are tighter, more people are interested and Ted Turner can
rest easier knowing he doesn’t have to broadcast any September Braves
games on TBS.

Start up the playoffs while the sun still sets before 7:00 at night and
finish up the World Series as quickly as possible. Then everyone can go
home before you can say ‘‘Welcome to ESPN’s coverage of the NFL
preseason.”’

NOTES—Here’s the mid-term predictions. Since the Mets went down
the tubes (there is a God) I’ll have to pick the Oakland A’s to win the
Series in five games. Look for the Philadelphia Flyers, Edmonton Oilers

the NBA, the Detroit Pistons will finally bring home the championship.
And finally, Washington and Lee’s football team will beat the dreaded
Hampden-Sydney Squids on Homecoming. Final score: 21-10.....

Wa&L athletes sacrifice fun for competition

 

Jay Plotkin
Staff Reporter

 

It's Homecoming Weekend here
at Washington and Lee University.
What does that mean?

Sure, it means lots of women will be
around the campus. It means lots of
parties. It means a home football
game. It means a big Friday night
concert. So basically, it’s just like
every other weekend, only with a
fancy name.

Because it is that time of year, when
a big weekend occurrence is happen-
ing on campus, it is important not to
forget those students who aren’t going
to be able to have all the fun that
everyone else is. Yes, we must recog-
nize the athletes of this institution.

They can’t always go out over the
weekend and get trashed with the
majority of the school. They can’t go
to Friday night parties due to curfew

Pope +5.
Pope +2.

Unfortunately for him, Pope didn’t
get the touchdown that followed —
junior tight end Bob Martin scored it
on an 11-yard pass play from junior
quarterback Phil Sampson — but Pope
should probably get at least three of
Martin’s six points. In an 8-play,
88-yard scoring drive, he rushed for
51 yards on six carries.

Quayle’s PAT gave the Generals a
10-0 lead, a lead they took into the
third quarter, thanks to an end-zone
interception by Skeen when the Scots
threatened late in the second period.

Maryville took the third-quarter
kickoff but went nowhere. After a
3-yard gain on first down, W&L
sophomore free safety Clark Wight
broke up a pass on second down, and
junior tackle Scott Silverman sacked
Maryville’s Russ Thomas for a 1-yard
loss on third down. The Scots were
forced to punt.

The third quarter ended with a
30-yard W&L scoring drive. After
rushing four times for 4 yards in the
drive’s first six plays, Pope got the

before Saturday games. Sometimes,
they aren't even around to go to Sat-
urday night parties. How do they feel
about missing weekend social events?

“‘T don’t miss not being able to party
at all. I know I'll be able to party after
the season all I want,’’ said senior
water polo goalie Tom Rawls.

This weekend will be especially
rough for the water polo players.
They can’t go to Homecoming even if
they wanted to. They will be out on
the West coast, playing a tournament.

However, said Rawls, the thought
of playing in the tournament has made
the team work harder. ‘‘This week
our practices have been incredible.”’

Missing Homecoming takes a little
bit out of playing on a team. ‘“We’ve
missed Homecoming three out of four
years, and that takes away from the
fun a bit,’’ says senior Cross Country
captain Bill Clark.

Other than that, Clark says that he
doesn’t mind missing parties. ‘I don’t

make the score 17-0.

But Maryville head coach Phil
Wilks refused to send his starters to
the locker room. The Scots drove to
the W&L 2, where the defense held on
fourth down to preserve the shutout.

The final scoring drive of the game
saw Fallon run time off the clock with
six running plays and only one pass.
The drive ended when Quayle nailed a
35-yard field goal — his sixth in six at-
tempts this season — to lock up
W&L’s first win of the season.

regret running. I get a lot out of it. I
can make a commitment until the
season is over. I enjoy running and I
still have a lot of time to have fun.’’

Most athletes seem to agree that
when you make a commitment to play
sports, giving up part of your free
time is part of the sacrifice.

Says senior basketball player Lee
Brading, ‘‘Everyone realizes that it is
just part of the sacrifice when you play
a sport. It is only Saturday nights for
US, So it is not really a big deal.’’

It is not always a disadvantage to
miss some weekend parties says soph-
omore volleyball player Sarah Allen.
‘That is one of the advantages of be-

ing on a team. Missing certain func-
tions is worth it because of all the peo-
ple you meet while on the team.”’

Senior water polo player Stu Shel-
don summed the general feelings up.
**It’s something you get used to. Sure,
we don’t like it when we miss things

Films better late than never

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

I can remember driving through
Lexington for the first time in 1984
and noticing what a quaint little town
it was with its architecture, its schools
and its people. It was almost as if I had
been put back in time a few dozen
years. About that time I drove past the
theatre and noticed that ‘‘The Wizard
of Oz”’ had finally made it to big Lex.
For a moment it was kinda like Back
to the Future, but once I got back on to
Main Street for lunch at Arby's, I
knew all was well.

Granted, no one has ever accused
Lexington of being ahead of the times.
In fact, they’re usually behind them.
That's not really not so bad though if
you think about it; especially when
movies are concerned. I mean where
else can you see two of the hottest
films of the swmmer in the middle of
October. You gotta love it.

It was good week for movies, with
the exception ofCaddyshack II which
we won't even grace with space.
(After the original Caddyshack, rumor
had it that 2 would be set at an all-
black country club and would star Ed-
die Murphy, Arsenio Hall, Sammie
Davis Jr., Bill Cosby, Redd Foxx and
one white guy to be named later. I
think they blew it on the sequel.)

There is no question that Coming to
America andBig were two of this
summer’s best and funniest films.

Eddie Murphy’s Coming to America
starts off a little slowly but picks up
steam like a San Francisco trolley with
no brakes. Murphy plays a prince who
decides that he wants to find his own

wife instead of being told he will
marry a certain woman. After much
thought he determines that the best
place to look for a queen would be,
(boing) Queens, New York.

Arsenio Hall plays Murphy’s per-
sonal manservant and best friend and
complements Murphy very well. Hall
is really coming on as a comic and will

take his place beside the aforemen-
tioned comics in time. If Coming to
America is any indication of the fu-
ture, Arsenio’s will be quite bright.
The finest aspect of the film is the
diversity of Murphy and Hall’s talent.
Throughout the course of the film the
two play at least five roles a piece and
they are absolutely hilarious. There is
no question, however, that the high-
point of the comedy comes in the bar-

ber shop when the guys in the barber
shop are arguing about who was the
greatest fighter of all-time. Murphy
plays two characters and Hall one in
the scene and it is just priceless.
(Murphy does play the old, white
man).

The film is fresh and very creative.
There is a tie toTrading Places with
Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche that
The most refreshing
thing though, is seeing once again that
Eddie Murphy is at his best and most
talented when he’s not trying to cuss
the walpaper off the wall.

It is becoming increasingly more
evident every six months or so that
Tom Hanks is moving to the forefront
of the comedy world. His new
filmPunchline with Sally Field is get-
ting rave reviews from just about
everyone and his face is on the cover
of every major magazine around.
When did this happen you ask? This
summer.

Thanks to the brilliant direction of
Penny (Laverne & Shirley) Marshall
and the absolute comic genius of
Hanks, a film idea that had been ha-
shed and rehashed over and over again
took on new life and stormed the
summer box offices as one of the
summer’s best films.

Big is a simple story about a kid
who makes a wish about being big and
gets his wish. The beauty of the film is
not the story, it’s the acting. Hanks

The film has scene after scene that
are clearly directed brilliantly and are

Sewartz in New York is priceless, as
is the scene in Elizabeth Perkins

film. It is just made up of one great
scene after another that never go

Guadalcanal Diary

 

From Elektra Records press

Having emerged unscathed
from the recent ‘‘holy wars’’ con-
troversy, Guadalcanal Diary con-
tinues to enjoy the success of their
third LP, subtly titled 2X4. Like a
Waffle House sign in the early
hours of Sunday morning, 2X4
shines with a promise of hope for
a wicked world. Produced by Don
Dixon (Smithereens, R.E.M.,
Marti Jones, Marshall Crenshaw),
the newest album marks a return
to the high-octane rock and roll
that brought this Georgia band out
of the boondocks to take on the
world.

Guadalcanal Diary’s original
members have been driving a
funny car in the fast lane of show-
biz since their humble beginnings
in 1981, playing for a friend’s
wedding. The group is a proud
product of Marietta, Georgia, nes-
tled in the same festering Bible
Belt which unleashed both rock
and roll and fundamentalist reli-
gion on an unsuspecting world.

Guadalcanal Diary released
their first vinyl in 1983, an EP tit-
led Watusi Rodeo, produced by
Bruce Baxter for E.O.D. Records.
Manager Warren Chilton shot a
low-bodgetcinema-verite video
that became an underground
classic, drawing praise from such
diverst sources as MTV and the
American Film Institute. In 1984

came the debut LP, Walking in the
Shadow of the Big Man (DB Re-
cords), recorded and mixed by
Don Dixon in an incredible 50
hours--‘‘totally drug- free.’’ The
band is quick to add, “except for
coffee and the occasional pencil.’’
On the basis of the album’s im-
pressive sales and laudatory re-
views as well as the band’s blister-
ing live shows, Elektra Records
signed Guadalcanal Diary in May,
1985 and issued a remastered ver-
sion of Big Man as the first release
under the new contract.

. Relentless touring of the United
States led to a European trek in the
fall of 85, where the gospel of the
Diary was preached to waiting
heathens in England, Sweden,
Norway, Germany, Switzerland,
France and Holland. A second
album, Jamboree, was released in
1986. Produced by Rodney Mills
(Cruzados, Greg Allman), this
wildly eclectic set only made it
more difficult for critics to hang
an easy label on Guadalcanal
Diary.

Having established themselves
as the highest-paid entertainers in
Las Vegas (and having sold more
records than Roger Whitaker and
Zamfir combined), Guadalcanal
Diary withdrew from the spotlight
of stardom in June, 1987 to record
2X4. In the depths of Atlanta’s
Axis Studios, far from the gla-

mour and tinsel, the champagne
and flashbulbs, band and producer
worked together to achieve the
perfect Vulcan mind-meld. As
Don Dixon notes, ‘*We had three
weeks longer to ruin this one than
we had to make Big Man.”’

The resulting album is a high-
water mark for Guadalcanal
Diary, combining the foursome’s

characteristically tongue-in-cheek
black humor with Dixon’s bril-
liantly buoyant production.
Through songs that explore me-
chanization and childhood super-
stitions, T.V. evangelism and
youth-targeted advertising, 2X4’s
lyrical themes are borne on music
that is fittingly jubilant, driving
and confident. The opening track,

‘“‘Litany (Life Goes On),’’ is an
ebullient anthem to life eternal
which sets the tone for the whole
LP. From the punishing crunch of
*‘Under the Yoke’’ to the driving
call-and-response of ‘‘Get Over
It,”’ these twelve songs snap,
crackle and pop until ‘‘Lips of
Steel’’ closes the set in a wash of
neo-Jet Age psychedelia.

»

ducer/engineer John Jansen
(Supertramp, Cutting Crew) says:
‘They are all of the above: a
synth/guitar pop rock dance
band—with a quirky sense of
humor.’’ But to the audience
they’re simply the Producers.
Since 1980 the Producers have
played a sprightly, ironic brand of
power pop. Signed by Portrait
after a single audition: with pro-

ducer Tom Werman (‘‘It was the
best live audition ever done for
me. I knew midway through the
third song I wanted them.’’), the
band put out a debut album re-
markable for its energy, melodies
and good spirits. The band had a
couple or regional singles and
enough MTV rotation to be in-
vited to perform at the first ever
MTV ‘‘New Year’s Eve Party’’.
‘What viewers saw that night was a
fresher, more energetic take on
bands like Cheap Trick, The Cars
or The Knack; a band that played
sugarpop to the hilt, but whose na-
tural abilities and emotional con-
cerns were leading them instinc-
tively to aspire to pop music’s
more serious side.

In 1982, The Producers came
out with a beefed-up sound, more
mature lyrics, a tougher poplook
and their strongest single to date
(‘‘She Sheila’). This was fol-
lowed (in retrospect) by the dues-

paying the band avoided with their
seemingly effortless signing to
Portrait. They became the quites-
sential road band, packing in lyal
crowds on the strength of their
new albums, live zaniness and
word of mouth.

After two years of this, bassist
Kyle Henderson left to pursue in-
dividual musical directions; he
was replaced by Tim Smith. The
band recorded and marketed an
independent LP in 1985 (Run For
Your Life) that contained a strong
ballad (‘‘Waiting on a Train’’),
but which also revealed an un-
characteristic slump in_ their
trademark humor and energy—a
result, no doubt, of the road’s
wear and tear.

Now, all that is about to change,
because The Producers, who
seemlessly melded pop, rock,

The Ring-tum Phi, Homecoming Supplement October 13, 1988 4

Scheduling is key to football success

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

I went to the Virginia Tech/South
Carolina football game last Satur-
day in Blacksburg. It was Home-
coming Weekend for the Hokies
and, despite all the typical revelry
and hoopla that accompany a foot-
ball game (even more so for
Homecoming), there was a sense
of dread among the Tech faithful.
You see, the Cocks (as they are
so affectionately nicknamed) were
coming into the contest ranked
eighth in the nation, led by quar-
terback and Heisman trophy can-
didate Todd Ellis. Not exactly a
big morale booster for the home
team.

Tech almost beat ‘em, losing
26-24, but that’s not the point.
The point is that the Hokies
shouldn’t have had to worry about
beating anyone on Homecom-
ing—they should be playing
someone easy, like VMI. Every-
one’s doing it. South Carolina
took on Appalachian St. (who?) in
its Homecoming a week earlier,
not exactly a contender for the
national championship. Two years
ago East Carolina played some-
thing like five Homecoming
games, .its own and four other
teams’. We’re talking cream-puff
city here, and not the kind you get
at County Kitchen.

Since I’ve come to W&L, the
Generals are 1-2 in Homecoming
affairs, winning my freshman year
while dropping the last two in a
row. Overall, since non-scholar-

ship athletics came into existence,
the Generals are 17-14-2. Not
exactly a record that sets the old
pulse racing, eh?

On Saturday, the W&L wel-
comes that oasis of masculinity,
Hampden-Sydney, to Wilson
Field. The Squids last week
played Emory and Henry tough,
losing 21-14. Far be it for me to
say the Generals can’t win this
game (In fact, I am extremely op-
timistic about W&L’s chances.
But remember, everything I think
and do is drug-induced), but why
should the outcome even be in
doubt?

Let’s bring in East Poedunk U.
for Homecoming. Or Joe Blow St.
How about Roanoke? (Whoops, I
forgot. The Maroons are too civi-
lized to have a football team)
Well, ship their I-M champs up
here. Does Mary Baldwin have a
football program? (Strike that.
That wasn’t very nice.) Aca-
demics? I don’t care if the school
we schedule doesn’t even require

Next year?

    

The Lexington High School football team would be a real challenge for next year’s Homecoming game.

fore 1:30, and then get to see the
Generals kick some ass. Hell, this
way no one can get upset when the
people leave at halftime. There
will be a legitimate reason. W&L
will be so far ahead the game will
already be over.

Guaranteed wins have been a
part of football scheduling for
years. You say its unethical? What
is this, a philosophy class? I don’t
think anyone would care if we
played St. George’s School for thé
Blind, as long as we come away
with the victory. There’s nothing
more enjoyable than seeing your
home team pound some weakling
into submission. Think about it.
All the players’ stats will be bet-
ter, the starters can rest up for that

night’s parties, and the W&L
Sports Information Director can
sleep easier at nights.

If all this doesn’t persuade you,
consider the good-time theory.
Here’s how it works. From Friday
afternoon until Sunday morning,
having a good time is top priority.
If the Generals lose, than every-
one’s fun is stopped (albeit for
only a short while, because I’m
sure, for most people, having a
good time does not hinge on the
outcome of the football game).
With a cream-puff opponent,
W&L wins big and everyone goes
home happy. Everybody’s good
time is uninterrupted. This results
in a continuous good time (the
premium of good times), and also

stops people from blaming coedu-
cation for our lack of football
prowess.

People go to football games for
excitement and school com-
raderie. What could be better than
seeing the Generals light up the
scoreboard- against a team like,
say, Southern Sem? (Whoops,
strike number two. Again, that
wasn’t very nice) a

By consciously selecting a
featherweight football team for
their Homecoming opponent, the
Generals can pad their record and
a good time can be had by all. And
isn’t that what this weekend is all
about?

Lee service held

 

By Beckwith Archer
Staff Reporter

 

_ _ The twelfth of October was the
118th anniversary of the passing of the
General-in-Chief of the CSA and the
fc.mer president of Washington and
Lee University, Robert Edward Lee.
A memorial service honoring the me-
nidity of Lee and his many contribu-
tons was held at noon in Lee Chapel.

The Liberty Hall Volunteers mar-
ched into the chapel at noon to the toll-
ing of the passing bell, and the cere-
mony commenced. The invocation
was delivered by Dr. Louis Hodges,
the university chaplain, and introduc-
tory remarks concerning the great
effort which has gone into planning
and preparation for the service,- were
given by Capt. Robert C. Peniston.
Southern Comfort then sang ‘*Dixie,””
which, in the solemnity of the chapel,

. was both beautiful and haunting.

Dr. Taylor Sanders, the university
historian, was the speaker for the ser-

‘ vice. He captivated the audience with

his fable of a meeting with General
Lee several months ago. He went on
to relate just how Lee would have felt

‘ about the university today.

New visitation and drinking
policies at Boston University may set
a precedent at other colleges and uni-
versities across the nation. Since the
new restrictions would sharply limit
student autonomy, perhaps the
policies themselves should be more
closely examined.

BU’s new alcohol policy limits the
amount of alcohol in the dorms to a
six-pack of beer or one liter of any
other alcoholic beverage. After this
policy was put into effect, the Boston
licensing board stated that all Boston
Buse must restrict the amount of

families, and the total value of the
school was $63,000. Sanders said that
the general would be pleased with the
school today.

There were several contributions
that Lee made to the university, which
undoubtedly have gone largely unre-
cognized. Before Lee came to the uni-
versity, the entire curriculum con-
sisted of Greek, Latin and mathema-
tics.

Lee wanted men who were ‘‘trained
in practical professions,’’ so he added
the law school, engineering, journal-
ism, bookkeeping and business. Lee
and the faculty made church atten-
dance voluntary for the first time and
the general was delighted that the stu-
dents opted to attend.

Many feel that the Honor System
was unquestionably Lee’s greatest
contribution to the university. When
he arrived, he abolished the long list
of rules and regulations, which the
school had. He insisted that you could
not tell young people how to live their
lives, that instead they must be taught
by example.

Sanders said that Lee would be very
satisfied with today’s Honor system
and the ways in which it has been
adapted to fit modern times.

Lee sought to teach, through his ac-

adopts new restrictions

alcohol in college dormitories.

The two visitation policies being
considered for inclusion in next year’s
policy revisions include prohibiting
guests of the opposite sex in dorms
and limiting the number of guests al-
lowed in the dorms to four between
the hours of 8-11 p.m. on Sunday-Th-
ursday and from 8 p.m. to | a.m. on
Friday and Saturday.

Scott Edwards, a public relations
spokesperson for the university, said a
task force has been set up to devise the
policies.

Edwards said that complaints from
students and parents concerning the
noise levels and the violation of a stu-
dent’s privacy when a roommate had
guests in the room, prompted the de-

cision to develop the policies. He said,
‘“We wanted to maintain a serious
study environment at Boston Univer-
sity.”’

At a press conference last Wednes-
day, 1,000 students protested the
resolutions. Students said they felt the
university was violating their rights to
freedom.

When asked if he thought the
policies would affect enrollment in the
future, Edwards said, ‘‘That’s hard to
say. I’m sure it will have an effect, but
I’m not sure how much or how little.”’
Edwards also stressed that the visita-
tion policies have not yet been fina-
lized and that the task force is con-
sidering all recommendations for im-
provement of the policies. Since the

Legislature believes the state should
not have to pay.

If the no-smoking law is successful
in deterring these officials from smok-
ing, supporters of the bill believe that
the number of disabilities will be re-
duced and that state disabilities pen-
sion costs will be reduced.

The passage of this law raises many
questions about how far the govern-
ment can go to restrict the behavior of
public employees. Future litigation
suits by either fired or disgruntled
public safety officials could allow the
Massachusetts courts to answer some
of these questions.

Supporters of the ban are confident
that the law will be upheld by the
courts, citing a U.S. Court of Appeals
decision last year affirming the Okla-
homa City Fire Department’s smoking

ban. In that case, a firefighter trainee
was fired for smoking while off duty.
Rejecting the trainee’s contention that
his privacy rights had been violated,
the court ruled that the fire depart-
ment’s regulation was a rational at-
tempt to promote health and physical
conditioning for firefighters. In addi-
tion, since the new law only applies to
new employees who will be made
aware of this condition prior to em-
ployment, many supporters believe
that future complaints will be easily
dealt with in or out of the courts.

Opponents, including union leaders
and Tobacco Institute spokesmen,
contend that the new law will create
numerous disputes, which will ulti-
mately have to be settled in the courts
with a great deal of controversy and
public expense.

policies will directly affect the stu-

receive as much input from the stu-
dents as possible.

Boston University has not yet no-
ticed any change or improvements
since the program was implemented
because it has only been in effect since
Sept. 15. But, Edwards did concede
that the resolutions will be difficult to
enforce. Still, he said that many
schools across the United States have
similar programs, and many more are
following in their footsteps.

Such policies could set a precedent
for universal regulations to be estab-

Mercer admits to
theft of porcelain

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

R. William Mercer, a 1988 gra-
duate of Washington and Lee, Wed-
nesday admitted he was guilty of steal-
ing $10,000 worth of porcelain and
ivory figurines from the university's
Reeves Center.
Mercer, 22, appeared in Rock-
bridge County Circuit Court and told
the court his plea was guilty, but
Judge George E. Honts III agreed to
withhold acceptance or rejection of
the plea pending a pre-sentence re-
port.

But Mercer’s attorney, Marshall
Mundy of Roanoke, asked the court to
accept the plea under advisement until
a pre-sentence report could be com-
pleted.

Honts refused to accept that motion,

but he did agree to adjourn the case
until the report is available. Honts
may accept or reject Mercer’s guilty
plea when the case is resumed.

If convicted, Mercer could be sen-
tenced to up to 20 years in prison.

about Aug. 4 and eight small carved
ivory figurines from the Reeves
Center, where he worked last sum-
mer.

After he was arrested on Oct. 16,
Mercer was released on a $5,000 un-
secured bond, according to court re-
cords.

The objects have been returned to
the center, according to Lt. Stephen
E. Crowder of the Lexington Police
Department.

Executive Notes:
EC to meet with trustees

 

By Stacy L. Morrison
Staff Reporter

Executive Committee President
Christopher deMovellan will meet
with the Washington and Lee Univer-
sity Board of Trustees this weekend to
ask the board to fund student needs for
the campus and community, said de-
Movellan at the EC meeting Monday
night.

If anyone has suggestions they want
brought before the Board of Trustees,
deMovellan said to talk to him today
at the latest.

DeMovellan will ask the Board of
Trustees to fund the purchase of two
vans for Live Drive, an organization
that provides transportation to and
from student parties on weekends.

The Board of Trustees is the
governing body of the university.

The entire EC will have lunch with
the Board of Trustees tomorrow after-

noon
_ In other business, the EC decided to

purchase an IBM computer package in
place of the Epson package it had
voted to purchase a month ago. IBM
computers can be serviced on campus
instead of having to be taken to Roan-
oke.

EC secretary Eddie Yu called a dis-
count computer dealer to get price
quotes. The EC agreed to purchase an
IBM PS-20 (model 30) computer with
an IBM monitor and a PP-2 printer for
a total cost of $1,890. A Word Perfect
package also will be purchased for an
additional $125.

Winners of the preliminary fresh-
man class officer elections, which
were held Monday, were announced
at the EC meeting. The run-off elec-
tion was held today.

Two candidates for each position —
EC representative, president and vice
president — were on the ballot in the
run-off election. Clayton A. Kenning-
ton and Fred Renneker won the preli-
minary election for EC representative.

sorority issue discussed

By Eleanor Nelson wast

Staff Reporter

 

A panel discussion on women’s
social organizations took place last
Thursday night in Lee Chapel.

The program’s purpose was to give
students information on sororities and
other possibilities for women’s social
organizations at W&L. A question
and answer session followed the panel
discussion.

National sororities and eating
houses were two possibilities discuss-
ed. The national director for extension
of national sororities, Lissa Bradford
spoke. The dean of Greek affairs at
the University of Richmond, Alison
Lord, discussed the recent coloniza-
tion of national sororities on that
school’s campus.

A senior from Davidson College,
Heather Fitzpatrick, discussed their
campus system of eating houses for

women.

Dean of Greek affairs at W&L,
Leroy ‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins and the pane-
lists then responded to students ques-
tions. At this time students were able
to express their concerns about the
opportunity of women’s social organi-
zations at W&L.

Bradford and Lord answered ques-
tions ranging from the likelihood of a
rush this year to the likelihood of phy-
sical sorority houses. A winter rush
could take place this school year.
‘‘Physical sorority houses are un-
necessary; we started sororities two
and a half years ago without them at
Richmond and we still don’t have
them,”” said Lord.

At this time, 18 sororities‘are inter-
ested in colonizing at W&L. ‘‘The
sorority advisory committee would
assess which national sororities would
best meet the students’ needs, and
which ones would provide the best co-

lonization support,’’ said Sorority
Advisory Committee member Erin
Cosby.

A forum will take place this Mon-

day, Oct. 24, in Lee Chapel at 7:30

p.m. At this time a panel of two W&L
students and two faculty members will
open discussion on the pros and cons
of sororities, eating clubs and other
possibilities. All studests concerned
with the issue should attend.

The 93 students who signed a peti-
tion for sororities last winter term, the
64 students who asked to be on the ad-
visory committee over the summer,
and the students who attended last
Thursday’s panel all indicate an inter-
est on the W&L campus for some type
of social organizations for women.

OPINION

Students Face
‘Alarming’ Risk

Washington and Lee University has always been excellent at pro-
viding needed services to its students. This is especially true with
the housing situation: anyone who needed on-campus housing was
sure to get it.

 

What is not known, however, is that students who do receive on-

campus housing are accepting a dangerous risk that he or she can do
nothing about.

Just what is this risk? It is the all too familiar (and constant) ring-
ing of the fire alarm. So the fire alarms go off all the time? That just
means they work, right? Well, not really, when you consider that
fire alarms are only supposed to go off when there is a REAL fire.

The constant ringing poses a special problem. For one thing, it
never fails to go off at 2 to 3 in the morning. It also never fails that
at 2 or 3 in the morning, the student has 1) just come back from a
long night of studying or 2) just come back from a long night of par-
tying. Imagine, if you will, being disturbed by the unrestrained
ringing of the fire alarm when all you really want to do is sleep.
And that is what most students do —ignore the fire alarm.

The alarms have gone off almost nightly in the new Gaines Resi-
dence Hall in the last few weeks, and everyone knows that it hap-
pens almost constantly in Graham-Lees from the beginning of
Freshman Orientation to Commencement in June. After the fifth
time (and for some, the second time) the alarm has gone off, the de-
sire to leave the building gradually wanes. It is much like the prin-
ciple of diminishing returns: the more it happens, the less anyone
wants to do about it.

The university is responsible for the protection of its students
when they live in on-campus housing. To state the obvious, if
someday there is a REAL fire, no one will know to leave the build-
ing. At best, the Lexington fire department will soon arrive and
contain the fire; at worst, a dorm full of sleepy or intoxicated stu-
dents will not be able to leave in time.

Some can accept that Graham-Lees is an old building and with
this comes a certain understanding that things will malfunction.
This acceptance does not excuse, however, the need to find a solu-
tion to the problem. As long as we have been here, the fire alarm
has not been fixed satisfactorily.

As far as Gaines is concerned, nothing can be excused. The build-
ing is brand new and no amount of reasons (I.E. paint fumes) will
change the fact that the alarm system must be fixed.

This is a serious problem that should be addressed now by the
university. Somewhere along the hierarchy that exists at this
school, someone must take responsibility, whether Buildings and
Grounds does something about it, or a contractor fixes them, or
whoever. Now is the time to take control —before the fire alarm has
rung just one too many times. . ....

‘Lyric to be renovated

 

by John Vittori
Staff Reporter

 

The Lyric Theater building on

‘ South Main Street is expected to be

, Tenovated into retail shops and of-

fices, according to one of the buil-

‘ ding’s new co-owners, Patricia
, Roberts.

Roberts said she and her husband,

+ Walter F. Roberts Jr., bought the

, building on April 4, with the hopes of

* opening a restaurant/comedy club.

., Roberts said she wanted the restaurant

to be a step above Spanky’s, but not as

‘ elegant as the Willson-Walker House.

, She called it a ‘‘middle-of-the-road

restaurant,’’ saying that ‘‘There is a

‘ despearate need for that type of res-
, taurant in Lexington.

However, Roberts said the plans tell
‘through since they were not able to
, persuade anyone to take a chance in

Lexington. ‘‘Everyone had re-
‘servations about (the idea) in Lexing-
, ton,’ she said.

The new plans for the building call
for retail shops and offices on the first
floor and only offices on the second
and third floors. She said, ‘The profit
is greater with an office building in-
stead of a restaurant.”’

According to court records, the
Roberts’s bought the building from
Edward Side for $100,000. Roberts
said there is no set date for when the
renovation will begin or for the open-
ing of the shops and offices.

Clothes valued at $900 were taken
from the vehicle of a former Washing-
ton and Lee student last Saturday, ac-
‘cording to police reports.

A Volkswagen Jetta, belonging to
‘Richard G. Parkhurst, Jr., 22, of
‘Charlotte, NC, was parked on Tucker
Street when the automobile was en-
tered and the clothes were taken, ac-
\cording to Officer K.S. Coffey of the
Lexington Police Department.

* The theft occurred some time be-
.tween | a.m. and 10:30 a.m., and the
‘vehicle was unlocked.

 

A local Democratic Party cam-
paign headquarters has opened in
downtown Lexington.

The offices, at 22 N. Main St. in the
old Grand Piano store, were opened
last week by former Gov. Charles
Robb who is campaigning for the U.S.
Senate.

The offices will serve the cam-
paigns of Robb, U.S. Rep. James Olin
(D-Va, 6th district) and the Dukakis-
Bentsen presidential ticket. The of-
fices will be open from 10 a.m. to 5
p.m. Monday through Friday,
through Election Day on Nov. 8.

Position papers and political para-
phenalia, such as stickers and pamph-
lets, are available for the public.

The offices are a cooperative effort
between the Lexington Democratic
Party Committee and the Rockbridge

tions and not his words, self denial,
service, honor and courage. The stu-
dents and faculty of Washington and
Lee University still hold fast to these
values in a world that occasionally
tempts us to do otherwise. Sanders be-

lieved that Robert E. Lee would be
proud of what he has created, and tou-
ched by the memorial service held in
his memory.

As the audience sang Lee’s favorite
hymn, ‘‘How Firm a Foundation,”’
and the Liberty Hall Volunteers filed
out, thoughts were on the great gen-
eral and the steadfast foundation that
he established so long ago.

‘Hello Lexington’

 

by John Vittori
Staff Reporter

 

‘*Hello Lexington’’ is a welcom-
ing service started by the Lexington
Downtown Development Association
(LDDA) in May 1988, representative
Marjorie Page said.

LDDA Executive Director Diane
Herrick said ‘‘Hello Lexington’’ was
started to welcome new residents to
the town. She said the program is
modeled after a similar welcoming
service in Bedford, Va.

Page said she searches out new resi-
dents by talking to the deans of Wash-
ington and Lee University and Vir-
ginia Military Institute, realtors, and
people in town. ‘‘A big portion of our

new residents are new facul-_

ty,”’ she said.
Page takes a basket of coupons,

. gifts and information from 30 Lexing-

ton businesses and several other non-
profit organizations in town to the new
residents. She also discusses LDDA
with them and provides more informa-
tion on Lexington. She said she is al-
ways asked questions about whom
to call for babysitters, repairs and

‘ even chimney-sweeps. If she is unable

to answer their questions on the spot,
Page said she finds out and calls the
person back. ‘‘It really gives people a
good cross section of the businesses in
the downtown area,’ she said. ‘‘Bu-
sinesses count the coupons that are
used to correctly assess how beneficial
this service is for them,’’ Page said.
But no statistics have been asseembled
yet, Page said.

Liberty Hall Volunteers
honor W&L history

 

Staff Report

 

The Liberty Hall Volunteers will
hold memorial services for Thomas J.
‘*Stonewall’’ Jackson and Robert E.
Lee:

The Volunteers plan a Gentleman’s
Dinner, scheduled for Jan. 19, to
honor the births of Lee and Jackson.

The group also will honor the 126th
anniversary of Jackson’s death with a
service on the weekend of May 13.

According to David Burns, one of
the group’s leaders, last year the
group marched in uniform to Jack-
son’s grave, laid a wreath and fired a
volley from their rifles.

Wednesday, the group held a me-

morial service for Lee in Lee Chapel
on the Washington and Lee University

_ campus.

‘*Last year, a group of concerned
students realized that there was noth-
ing commemorating the death of Lee
and decided to begin an annual ser-
vice,’’ said Burns.

The Liberty Hall Volunteers is an
organization formed to ‘‘educate the
Washington and Lee community as to
the role played by students of Wash-
ington College during the Civil War,”’
Burns added.

The Volunteers dress up in Civil
War uniforms and drill, using infantry
tactics from that era. They re-create
Company I of the Fourth Virginia In-
fantry, the ‘Stonewall Brigade.”’

HC increases arrests

Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee University’s
Homecoming Weekend was ‘‘kind of
wild,’’ according to Lexington Police
Chief B.M. Beard.

Arrests were up overall and this has
the police concerned, said Beard.

The biggest increase was seen in the

-ces (DUIs) issued. According to
Beard, there were nine arrests for

~ DUIs during the weekend (two were

of non- students).

The high number of DUIs are still
the police’s greatest concern, said
Beard

Beard explained that officers are
taught to look for drivers who might
be driving while impaired.

“They will usually follow someone
who is zig-zagging or weaving. In
cases like this, there is a 75 percent
chance that the driver is drunk,”’
Beard said.

Following Monday’s forum, a one-

The surveys should be turned in to the

ministration told her that women
could not swim there because the only
access was through the men’s locker
room. It took a year to convince the
administration to allow women to
swim in the old pool, she said.

All three women said they felt
women in law were accepted. ‘*There
are problems about women’s percep-
tion... but it’s a societal concern...
We've seen slow change, but it’s a
slow. collective positive change,”’
said White, a law librarian and associ-
ate professor of law at the W&L Law
School.

Garrison, the first woman on the
W&L Alumni Board and the first
woman on the W&L Law Council,
echoed Wiant’s views when she said,
“TI felt no problems in women being
accepted as professional lawyers.
There have been some awkward situa-
tions, but they were funny.”’

Karin Garvin, president of the
WLSO, organized the seminar and
said that the WLSO plans to organize
more events in the future to ‘‘reach
out to undergraduate women and to
encourage undergraduate women to
get involved in some of WLSO’s acti-
vities.’’ WLSO is currently planning a
day, tentatively in November, for
undergraduate women to attend law
school classes for a day, talk with ad-
ministration and participate in infor-
mal discussions.

New hotel?

By Cheryl Bowles
Staff Reporter

 

 

The Lexington City Council Thurs-
day approved permission for de-
veloper David J. Nodine to apply for
an Urban Development Action Grant
(UDAG) for the construction of a
downtown hotel.

The council approved the applica-
tion even though the funding for the
federal grant has been suspended in-
definitely. The cost of the hotel de-
velopment is estimated at $1.5 mil-
lion.

Nodine is planning to build the new
hotel in the historical Old Main Street
Mall building without destroying the
original structure, said Kathy Causey,
administrative assistant to City Man-
ager Joseph C. King. She said Nodine
plans to make interior changes, add to
the top of the building, and extend it
back toward Randolph Street.

If Nodine gets the grapt, he will be
expected to repay the city with re-
venue from the hotel, and the city has
agreed to use some of that money to
build a parking lot for the hotel.

Interfraternity Council rep-
resentatives to the October 15 meeting
of the Alumni Fraternity Corporation
(AFC) reported an adamant concern
within the corporation regarding the
purchase of alcohol, particularly kegs
of beer, with house funds.

Every W&L fraternity, except Kap-
pa Sigma, has a rule against house-
funded alcohol purchases. The
alumni, however, are pushing for the
adoption of an IFC Constitution By-
Law requiring each house to live by
uniform restrictions.

“The, idea,’’ contends IFC Vice-
President Jeff Kelsey, ‘‘is that every-
body has got to live by the same
rules.’’ Most house corporations of
chapters on campus have already es-
tablished regulations regarding this
matter, but all the regulations are
worded differently and have different
provisions. One fraternity president
commented, for example, that his
chapter is permitted to buy alcohol for
special occasions, such as Parents’
Weekend, with special permission of
its house corporation.

ference to many fraternities’ practice
of pooling money from the member-
ship body to purchase alcohol for a
party. ‘‘It doesn’t make any difference
how it’s paid for,’’ he continued. ‘‘It’s
still the fraternity buying the alco-
hol.”’

One reason for regulations are to
protect fraternities from liability for
serving alcohol to guests. This issue
concerns every house, nationally as
well as locally.

Although the banning of kegs is an
unpopular idea, safety is the motivat-
ing factor behind the ban.

Squids slip past Generals

Mistakes prove costly in 22-20 loss

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

W&L football’s starting offense and
starting defense turned in their best
performances of the season Saturday,

\but their best wasn’t good enough to
keep Hampden-Sydney from spoiling
yet another W&L homecoming.

On the last play of the first half, the
Tigers took advantage of a prevent de-
fense that didn’t. Later, they were just
as opportunistic on a bad snap on a
fourth-quarter punt to steal a 22-20
victory that left W&L coach Gary Fal-
lon disappointed with the final score
but not with his team’s play overall.

‘*We gave forth a tremendous effort
against a good football team,’’ Fallon
said. ‘‘We’re improving every
week.”’

The game began with W&L’s most
impressive drive of the season. The
Generals balanced rushing by senior
tailback Tony Waskiewicz and junior
fullback Russell Crosby with the pass-
ing attack of junior quarterback Phil-
lip Sampson, and the result was a
15-play, 63-yard scoring drive that
ended with a four-yard carry by soph-
omore tailback Mason Pope. Sopho-
more Carter Quayle’s extra point gave
W&L a 7-0 lead with 8:22 left in the
first quarter.

The Tigers responded with a

, 58-yard drive built around running
back Chris Barth. The W&L defense
‘ held on third down at its own 12, but
, Tommy Mallis came on to kick a
29-yard field goal and cut the W&L
« lead to four.

But the W&L offense would soon
get back its seven-point lead. The
Generals drove to midfield before the
first quarter ended, and Sampson

‘ found Waskiewicz for a 22-yard gain
, on the first play of the second. Four

downs later, Quayle nailed a 39-yard
field goal that put W&L back up by a
touchdown.

The defenses took over for most of
the rest of the second period. The
Generals failed to capitalize on two
Sydney turnovers in the quarter — a
fumbled Tom Skeen punt that was re-
covered by senior defensive end Tony
Onorato and an interception by junior

Bland Warren — and the W&L
offense stalled on a fourth-and-three
play at the Tiger 10.

Fallon later said he wanted more
than a 10-point halftime lead— which
is all a Quayle field goal would have
given him — and so went for it on
fourth down.

‘‘We have to score touchdowns
when we can get them,”’ Fallon said,
and so he called a pass-option play
that sent three receivers out of the
backfield on short patterns and al-
lowed Sampson to run if a hole opened
up. But the W&L receivers got cros-
sed up on their patterns, according to
Fallon, and Sampson’s pass to junior
tight end Bob Martin fell incomplete.
The Tigers took over on downs at
their own 10 with 1:17 left in the half.

Hampden-Sydney ran eight plays
before the period ended, and on seven
of them the Tiger two-minute offense
was somewhere between mediocre
and awful. But the last play of the half
was — what else — a Flutie-esque
bomb in the end zone. Four W&L
safeties were back on Fallon’s prevent
defense, but flanker Stephen Waskey
pulled in the 51-yard prayer. Mallis
kicked the extra point to tie the score
at 10.

But the Tigers couldn’t carry any
momentum from that play into the
third quarter. They took the second-
half kickoff but drove only 17 yards
on seven plays before punting.

Instead it was the Generals who

started the second-half scoring.
Quayle’s eighth field goal of the
season, a 40-yarder that tied the
school record for most field goals in
one season, came after a 51-yard drive
and gave the Generals a 13-10 lead.

After an exchange of punts, the
Tigers re-tied the game early in the
fourth quarter on a 24-yard kick by
Mallis.

The Generals started their next
drive at the W&L 16 with 11:54 re-
maining, but the offense stalled when
Pope was stopped for no gain on
fourth and one at the Hampden-
Sydney 44.

The Tigers couldn’t take advantage,
though, and punted to the W&L 22.
Two incompletions and a sack sent
Tom Skeen into the game to punt.
Onorato’s snap was high, and Skeen
was forced to take a safety that gave ~
the Tigers a 15-13 lead.

Unfortunately for the Generals, that
safety would go on to cost more than
two points. With newfound momen-
tum, the Tigers went on their most
impressive drive of the day. Hamp-
den-Sydney’s offense clicked for at
least 3 yards on six straight plays, in-
cluding two Barth carries for 9 yards,
and scored on an 18-yard run by full-
back Chris Underwood. Mallis added
the point after that gave the Tigers a
commanding 22-13 lead with only
2:34 remaining.

With only 1:15 left, Hampden-
Sydney, coach Joe Bush sent in his
backups to run out the clock, and the
W&L defense took full advantage.
The Tigers were held to only eight
yards on three plays and ran an option
play on fourth and four. Onorato step-
ped in front of the pitch and grabbed it
out of midair. Eighty-two yards later,
he was mauled by jubilant Generals
who realized that the game, with 1:15
remaining, wasn’t out of reach.

West equals success for polo

 

By Tom Wingfield
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee water polo team traveled wes-
twang: thisipast weekend with something to prove. The
Genérals Wanted to show the some of the top teams on the
WeS&t Coast) that a Eastern school like W&L could play
good water polo. The West Coast teams have heard of
schools like Navy, Brown and Bucknell but now they have
to include W&L in that list of good East Coast water polo
programs.

The Generals, ranked 18th in the nation, began their
mission by facing 19th-ranked Claremont on Friday after-
noon. W&L came out of the locker room pumped up and
ready to play. It was immediately apparent that the team
was in for a dogfight. There was not much scoring in the
first half and the two teams went into the halftime tied at
1-1.

The second half was as close as the first but with a little
more offensive production. Senior David Dietz scored
four goals to give head coach Page Remillard, who coa-
ched at Claremont before coming to W&L, one of his
biggest wins of his coaching career. The final score was
5-4 with the key to the victory being the goaltending per-
formance of junior David Olson.

**All weekend Olson gave the team lifetime performan-
ces, said illard. ‘‘He played extremely well after com-

| ing off a serious sprain in three of his fingers on his throw-

ing hand. We have to give credit to our trainer for getting
David healthy.”

After the Generals’ victory over Claremont, they headed
south for San Diego where they played the No. 10 team in
the nation, University of California at San Diego. The
Generals came, put strong and took a 2-1 lead after the first
quarter. At this point in the game, jet lag seemed to catch
up with W&I.. UCSD took control and went on the beat
the Generals 13-3.

“It was a combination of them being a better team and
us being tired. They took the upper hand in the game and
like a good team they didn’t let us back in it,’’ said Remil-
lard.

The Generals’ final game of the trip was against Pomon-
a-Pitzer University. W&L was in control of the entire
game, coasting to victory by the score of 15-8. The
offensive output was led by Dietz with 5 goals, senior Da-
vid Reavy with 3 goals and freshman Jay Smith with 2
goals. Once again Olson shined in goal for the Generals
and capped off a great weekend for both himself and the
team.

Overall, Remillard was extremely pleased. ‘‘We drew
the attention of serious students from the West Coast.
These young men now realize they have a place to go in the
East to get an excellent education and play good water
polo,”’ he said.

The Generals will now look ahead to the first round of
the Southern League Tournament this weekend in Wil-
mington, N.C.

Volleyball

continues
to improve

 

By Beckwith Archer
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee women’s
volleyball team has been very busy for
the past week improving on its win-
ning record. The Generals moved to
11-6 overall after Tuesday night’s ac-
tion.

The Generals picked up another Old
Dominion Athletic Conference vic-
tory Friday night in Hollins. The
W&L women went down the road to
battle the women from Hollins and the
Generals drove home with a 15-3,
15-2, 12-15, 15-8 victory under their
belts.

But W&L may have gained more
than just a victory with its perfor-
mance against Hollins. The Generals
Virtually assured themselves of a berth
in the ODAC Tournament with the
win.

Things did not go as well for W&L
four days later, however. Although
they beat Salem College, 13-15, 15-6,
15-8, the Generals suffered a tough
ODAC setback at the hands of Emory
and Henry. W&L fell to the Wasps
15-2, 10-15, 15-8, 15-4.

The Generals began a comeback in
the second game of the match with
E&H, but they were unable to swing
the match back in their favor. Fresh-
men starters Marcy Brown and Ra-
shmi Sachan, who leads the team in
service percentage, were both out
with injuries, which continues to be a
sore spot for W&L head coach Susan
Dittman.

But Dittman praised the efforts of
substitutes junior Debbie Grove and
sophomore Connie Papazickos, say-
ing both were impressive in their first
starts.

While injuries continue to be a prob-
lem, Dittman is pleased with her
team’s talent and play. Experience is
the only missing ingredient

. ‘*We don’t have a big power hitter
like a lot of teams that we play,”’
Dittman said. ‘We get in great rallies,
but we have trouble putting it down
and winning the points. That will all
come with more experience.’’

Dittman said the team has been get-
ting that experience and is learning to
make the necessary adjustments to
other teams’ strengths.

The big players for the Generals
have been sophomore Lisa Jay, who
continues to set weil, senior co-
captain Vanessa Hartman, who leads
the team in hitting, freshman Mena
McGowin, who is tied with Hartman
for the lead in blocks per game, and
senior co-captain Melissa Thrasher,
who has been the most consistent
player on the team, ranking second in
both serving and hitting. The Gen-
erals’ next action is tonight in the
Warner Center, when ODAC-rival
Sweet Briar and Ferrum are in town
for a tri-match. The Sweet Briar
match is set to begin at 6:30.

Clark captures first place;
Teams ‘run well’ for fourth

Mary Washington, Eastern Mennon-
ite, Christopher Newport and Hamp-
ton Institute. Hampton was the only
D-II team to beat the Generals.

‘‘It was a good meet for us, espe-
cially in getting us ready for ODAC’s
(the Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
ence meet) and Regionals,’’ Miller
said.

For the women’s team, the Gen-
erals’ performance almost mirrored
the men’s effort. Sophomore Paige
Cason was W&L’s top finisher, taking
8th place in a time of 20:38 for the
3.1-mile course. Classmate Cecily
Tynan also ran well ending up with a
14th-place finish. The Generals (3-3)
placed fourth overall out of eight
teams.

*“*] thought the women ran well
also,’’ Miller said. ‘‘Like I said, it
was a really good meet for both
teams.”’

This Saturday, the men’s team
travels to Bridgewater for a tri-meet
against the host school and West Vir-
ginia Tech, two teams Miller said he
did not expect to many problems with.
The women’s team will be idle this
week.

Both teams will have one more dual
meet on Oct. 29 before gearing up for
the conference championships on
Nov. 5. to be followed by the NCAA
Regional Championships on Nov. 12.

The Lexington City Council Thurs-
day approved permission for de-
veloper David J. Nodine to apply for
an Urban Development Action Grant
(UDAG) for the construction of a
downtown hotel.

The council approved the applica-
tion even though the funding for the
federal grant has been suspended in-
definitely. The cost of the hotel de-
velopment is estimated at $1.5 mil-
lion,

Nodine is planning to build the new
hotel in the historical Old Main Street
Mall building without destroying the
original structure, said Kathy Causey,
administrative assistant to City Man-
ager Joseph C, King. She said Nodine
plans to make interior changes, add to
the ton of the building, and extend it
back toward Randolph Street.

If Nodine gets the grapt, he will be
expected to repay the city with re-
venue from the hotel, and the city has
agreed to use some of that money to
build a parking lot for the hotel.

Rangers play to win

By James Johnson

Washington and Lee University’s
ROTC ranger challenge team partici-
pated in a head-to-head ranger compe-
tition against teams from the Univer-
sity of Virginia, James Madison Uni-
versity and Virginia Military Institute
on Saturday, Oct. 8.

The competition, hosted by the
W&L ROTC department, consisted of
four events; one-rope bridge building,

a hand grenade assault course, M-16
assault rifle and M-60 machine gun
assembly and a 10-kilometer forced
march.

The Mink Battalion team, coached

behind James Madison and VMI.

Deal said the young W&L team
“‘gained necessary experience, which
will help them to be competitive at the
upcoming brigade competition.”

The brigade ranger challenge com-
petition will take place Oct. 21-23 at
Fort A.P. Hill, Va.

By-laws reviewed

By Clint Wheelock
Staff Reporter

 

Interfraternity Council rep-
resentatives to the October 15 meeting
of the Alumni Fraternity Corporation
(AFC) reported an adamant concern
within the corporation regarding the
purchase of alcohol, particularly kegs
of beer, with house funds.

Every W&L fraternity, except Kap-
pa Sigma, has a rule against house-
funded alcohol purchases. The
alumni, however, are pushing for the
adoption of an IFC Constitution By-
Law requiring each house to live by
uniform restrictions.

*‘The, idea,’’ contends IFC Vice-
President Jeff Kelsey, ‘‘is that every-
body has got to live by the same
rules.’’ Most house corporations of
chapters on campus have already es-
tablished regulations regarding this
matter, but all the regulations are
worded differently and have different
provisions. One fraternity president
commented, for example, that his
chapter is permitted to buy alcohol for
special occasions, such as Parents’
Weekend, with special permission of
its house corporation,

than an inconvenient rule that can be
skirted,’’ said Leroy C. ‘*Buddy”’ At-
kins, dean of greek affairs, in re-
ference to many fraternities’ practice
of pooling money from the member-
ship body to purchase alcohol for a
party. ‘‘It doesn’t make any difference
how it’s paid for,’’ he continued. ‘‘It’s
still the fraternity buying the alco-
hol.”’

One reason for regulations are to
protect fraternities from liability for
serving alcohol to guests. This issue
concerns every house, nationally as
well as locally.

Although the banning of kegs is an
unpopular idea, safety is the motivat-
ing factor behind the ban.

Squids slip past Generals

Mistakes prove costly in 22-20 loss

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

WA&L football's starting offense and
starting defense turned in their best
performances of the season Saturday,
but their best wasn’t good enough to
keep Hampden-Sydney from spoiling
yet another W&L homecoming.

On the last play of the first half, the
Tigers took advantage of a prevent de-
fense that didn’t. Later, they were just
as opportunistic on a bad snap on a
fourth-quarter punt to steal a 22-20
victory that left W&L coach Gary Fal-
lon disappointed with the final score
but not with his team’s play overall.

‘*We gave forth a tremendous effort
against a good football team,’’ Fallon
said. ‘‘We'’re improving every
week.”’

The game began with W&L’s most
impressive drive of the season. The
Generals balanced rushing by senior
tailback Tony Waskiewicz and junior
fullback Russell Crosby with the pass-
ing attack of junior quarterback Phil-
lip Sampson, and the result was a
15-play, 63-yard scoring drive that
ended with a four-yard carry by soph-
omore tailback Mason Pope. Sopho-
more Carter Quayle’s extra point gave
WA&L a 7-0 lead with 8:22 left in the
first quarter.

The Tigers responded with a
58-yard drive built around running
back Chris Barth. The W&L defense
held on third down at its own 12, but
Tommy Mallis came on to kick a
29-yard field goal and cut the W&L
lead to four.

But the W&L offense would soon
get back its seven-point lead. The
Generals drove to midfield before the
first quarter ended, and Sampson
found Waskiewicz for a 22-yard gain
on the first play of the second. Four

From Staff Reports

 

The Washington and Lee men’s
soccer team experienced a tough
, week, playing well but coming
away with only a scoreless tie and a
shutout loss.

h On Friday, W&L goalies junior
Jack Pringle and sophomore Jon
Bull combined to shut out Guilford
in double overtime. However, the
Generals offense was stymied as

well and W&L was forced to settle
with a 0-0 tie.
Wednesday, the Generals

traveled to Fredricksburg where
there offensive continued, losing to
12th-ranked Mary Washington
4-0. W&L’s record now stands at
5-5-1, 2-1 in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference. Saturday on
the Liberty Hall Fields, W&L
plays Washington College at 2
p.m.

 

The W&L women’s soccer team
‘ went 1-2 over the past week. The
Generals romped past Randolph-
Macon Women’s College 7-0 last

downs later, Quayle nailed a 39-yard
field goal that put W&L back up by a
touchdown.

The defenses took over for most of
the rest of the second period. The
Generals failed to capitalize on two
Sydney turnovers in the quarter — a
fumbled Tom Skeen punt that was re-
covered by senior defensive end Tony
Onorato and an interception by junior
Bland Warren — and the W&L
offense stalled on a fourth-and-three
play at the Tiger 10.

Fallon later said he wanted more
than a 10-point halftime lead— which
is all a Quayle field goal would have
given him — and so went for it on
fourth down.

‘‘We have to score touchdowns
when we can get them,”’ Fallon said,
and so he called a pass-option play
that sent three receivers out of the
backfield on short patterns and al-
lowed Sampson to run if a hole opened
up. But the W&L receivers got cros-
sed up on their patterns, according to
Fallon, and Sampson’s pass to junior
tight end Bob Martin fell incomplete.
The Tigers took over on downs at
their own 10 with 1:17 left in the half.

Hampden-Sydney ran eight plays
before the period ended, and on seven
of them the Tiger two-minute offense
was somewhere between mediocre
and awful. But the last play of the half
was — what else — a Flutie-esque
bomb in the end zone. Four W&L
safeties were back on Fallon’s prevent
defense, but flanker Stephen Waskey
pulled in the 51-yard prayer. Maallis
kicked the extra point to tie the score
at 10.

But the Tigers couldn’t carry any
momentum from that play into the
third quarter. They took the second-
half kickoff but drove only 17 yards
on seven plays before punting.

Instead it was the Generals who

W&L were junior Catherine Bail-
lio and freshmen Ann Shaunessy
and Katie Seeman.

On Saturday on the Liberty Hall
fields, W&L hung tough with Ran-
dolph-Macon before succumbing
by the score of 3-0. Wednesday,
the Generals fell 2-1 to Virginia
Wesleyan on the road. The
women's record is currently 6-8,
3-3 in the ODAC. The Generals
play at Hollins Saturday and then
play host to Sweet Briar on Tues-
day in the first round of the ODAC
Tournament. Game time on the
Liberty Hall Fields is 4 p.m.

 

The W&L women's tennis team
completed its fall season with a
sparkling 8-1 mark. The Generals’
only defeat came at the hands of
Mary Washington, the defending
Division [I National Champions,
in a hard-fought 5-4 match. The
women are co-coached by Assis-
tant Athletic Director Cinda Ran-
kin and David McLeod 88’, a for-
mer W&L all-America tennis
player and currently a W&L ad-
missions assistant.

started the second-half scoring.
Quayle’s eighth field goal of the
season, a 40-yarder that tied the
school record for most field goals in
one season, came after a 51-yard drive
and gave the Generals a 13-10 lead.

After an exchange of punts, the
Tigers re-tied the game early in the
fourth quarter on a 24-yard kick by
Mallis.

The Generals started their next
drive at the W&L 16 with 11:54 re-
maining, but the offense stalled when
Pope was stopped for no gain on
fourth and one at the Hampden-
Sydney 44.

The Tigers couldn’t take advantage,
though, and punted to the W&L 22.
Two incompletions and a sack sent
Tom Skeen into the game to punt.
Onorato’s snap was high, and Skeen
was forced to take a safety that gave
the Tigers a 15-13 lead.

Unfortunately for the Generals, that
safety would go on to cost more than
two points. With newfound momen-
tum, the Tigers went on their most
impressive drive of the day. Hamp-
den-Sydney’s offense clicked for at
least 3 yards on six straight plays, in-
cluding two Barth carries for 9 yards,
and scored on an 18-yard run by full-
back Chris Underwood. Mallis added
the point after that gave the Tigers a
commanding 22-13 lead with only
2:34 remaining.

With only 1:15 left, Hampden-
Sydney coach Joe Bush sent in his
backups to run out the clock, and the
W&L defense took full advantage.
The Tigers were held to only eight
yards on three plays and ran an option
play on fourth and four. Onorato step-
ped in front of the pitch and grabbed it
out of midair. Eighty-two yards later,

West equals success for polo

 

By Tom Wingfield
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee water polo team traveled wes-
tward:thisipast weekend with something to prove. The
Genérals Wanted to show the some of the top teams on the
We&t Coast) that a Eastern school like W&L could play
good water polo. The West Coast teams have heard of
schools like Navy, Brown and Bucknell but now they have
to include W&L in that list of good East Coast water polo
programs.

The Generals, ranked 18th in the nation, began their
mission by facing 19th-ranked Claremont on Friday after-
noon. W&L came out of the locker room pumped up and
ready to play. It was immediately apparent that the team
was in for a dogfight. There was not much scoring in the
first half and the two teams went into the halftime tied at
1-1.

The second half was as close as the first but with a little
more offensive production. Senior David Dietz scored
four goals to give head coach Page Remillard, who coa-
ched at Claremont before coming to W&L, one of his
biggest wins of his coaching career. The final score was
5-4 with the key to the victory being the goaltending per-
formance of junior David Olson.

‘All weekend Olson gave the team lifetime performan-
ces, said Remillard. ‘‘He played extremely well after com-
ing off a serious sprain in three of his fingers on his throw-

ing hand. We have to give credit to our trainer for getting
David healthy.”’

After the Generals’ victory over Claremont, they headed
south for San Diego where they played the No. 10 team in
the nation, University of California at San Diego. The
Generals came, out strong and took a 2-1 lead after the first
quarter. At this point in the game, jet lag seemed to catch
up with W&L. UCSD took control and went on the beat
the Generals 13-3.

“It was a combination of them being a better team and
us being tired. They took the upper hand in the game and
like a good team they didn’t let us back in it,’’ said Remil-
lard.

The Generals’ final game of the trip was against Pomon-
a-Pitzer University. W&L was in control of the entire
game, coasting to victory by the score of 15-8. The
offensive output was led by Dietz with 5 goals, senior Da-
vid Reavy with 3 goals and freshman Jay Smith with 2
goals. Once again Olson shined in goal for the Generals
and capped off a great weekend for both himself and the
team.

Overall, Remillard was extremely pleased. ‘‘We drew
the attention of serious students from the West Coast.
These young men now realize they have a place to go in the
East to get an excellent education and play good water
polo,”’ he said.

The Generals will now look ahead to the first round of
the Southern League Tournament this weekend in Wil-
mington, N.C.

Volleyball

continues
to improve

 

By Beckwith Archer
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee women’s
volleyball team has been very busy for
the past week improving on its win-
ning record. The Generals moved to
11-6 overall after Tuesday night's ac-
tion.

The Generals picked up another Old
Dominion Athletic Conference vic-
tory Friday night in Hollins. The
W&L women went down the road to
battle the women from Hollins and the
Generals drove home with a 15-3,
15-2, 12-15, 15-8 victory under their
belts.

But W&L may have gained more
than just a victory with its perfor-
mance against Hollins. The Generals
virtually assured themselves of a berth
in the ODAC Tournament with the
win.

Things did not go as well for W&L
four days later, however. Although
they beat Salem College, 13-15, 15-6,
15-8, the Generals suffered a tough
ODAC setback at the hands of Emory
and Henry. W&L fell to the Wasps
15-2, 10-15, 15-8, 15-4.

The Generals began a comeback in
the second game of the match with
E&H, but they were unable to swing
the match back in their favor. Fresh-
men starters Marcy Brown and Ra-
shmi Sachan, who leads the team in
service percentage, were both out
with injuries, which continues to be a
sore spot for W&L head coach Susan
Dittman.

But Dittman praised the efforts of
substitutes junior Debbie Grove and
sophomore Connie Papazickos, say-
ing both were impressive in their first
Starts.

While injuries continue to be a prob-
lem, Dittman is pleased with her
team’s talent and play. Experience is
the only missing ingredient

. ‘We don’t have a big power hitter
like a lot of teams that we play,”’
Dittman said. ‘*We get in great rallies,
but we have trouble putting it down
and winning the points. That will all
come with more experience. ”’

Dittman said the team has been get-
ting that experience and is learning to
make the necessary adjustments to
other teams’ strengths.

The big players for the Generals
have been sophomore Lisa Jay, who
continues to set weil, senior co-
captain Vanessa Hartman, who leads
the team in hitting, freshman Mena
McGowin, who is tied with Hartman
for the lead in blocks per game, and
senior co-captain Melissa Thrasher,
who has been the most consistent
player on the team, ranking second in
both serving and hitting. The Gen-
erals’ next action is tonight in the
Warner Center, when ODAC-rival
Sweet Briar and Ferrum are in town
for a tri-match. The Sweet Briar
match is set to begin at 6:30.

Clark captures first place;
Teams ‘run well’ for fourth

Mary Washington, Eastern Mennon-
ite, Christopher Newport and Hamp-
ton Institute. Hampton was the only
D-II team to beat the Generals.

‘It was a good meet for us, espe-
cially in getting us ready for ODAC’s
(the Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
ence meet) and Regionals,’’ Miller
said.

For the women’s team, the Gen-
erals’ performance almost mirrored
the men’s effort. Sophomore Paige
Cason was W&L’s top finisher, taking
8th place in a time of 20:38 for the
3.1-mile course. Classmate Cecily
Tynan also ran well ending up with a
14th-place finish. The Generals (3-3)
placed fourth overall out of eight
teams.

“I thought the women ran well
also,’’ Miller said. ‘‘Like I said, it
was a really good meet for both
teams.”

This Saturday, the men’s team
travels to Bridgewater for a tri-meet
against the host school and West Vir-
ginia Tech, two teams Miller said he
did not expect to many problems with.
The women’s team will be idle this
week,

Both teams will have one more dual
meet on Oct. 29 before gearing up for
the conference championships on
Nov. 5. to be followed by the NCAA
Regional Championships on Nov, 12.

What is your all-time favorite movie ?

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

Last weekend one of the networks
aired a program hosted by Jerry Lewis
where people could call in and vote on
their favorite films in the categories of
comedy, drama, action/adventure and
science fiction/horror. Being some-
what of a film fanatic, I tuned in to
watch what I thought were the best
films in these genres blow away the
competition.

Well folks, it just didn’t happen.

For starters, the morons that called
into this show picked Tootsie as the
all-time greatest comedy. Well I’m
real sorry, but there’s no way. Come
on. Tootsie over Chaplin and Keaton?
Laurel and Hardy and Abbott and
Costello? O.K. forget slapstick. How
about The Graduate and for the sake
of argument (not the greatest comedy
of all-time but certainly in the same
class as Tootsie) how about The Blues
Brothers?

Unfortunately the disappointments
didn’t end with the comedy category.
Raiders of the Lost Ark won the action
category over The Bridge on the River
Kwai, Star Wars won the science fic-
tion/horror category over Close En-
counters of the Third Kind and Gone
With the Wind beat out Casablanca,
The African Queen, Citizen Kane and
The Godfather for best drama. In addi-
tion, Gone With the Wind won honors
as the best film of all-time because it
got the most calls during the night.

Well, I hate to be harsh, but the pin-
heads that called in and voted on this
show are clueless.

I realize that everyone is entitled to
their opinions but give me a break,
huh. I mean when was the last time
The Bridge on the River Kwai or Citi-
zen Kane came in second in a film
competition? Uh, never maybe. Ask
your parents what they think since
they were around when these films
were made. My dad thinks The Bridge
on the River Kwai is the greatest thing
since sliced white bread.

Regardless, I have decided to solve
this argument (at least part of it) once

and for all. In the coming weeks a
couple of boxes are going to be put in
busy areas of the campus and in those
boxes we want you to put a list of your
favorite ten films of all-time. If you
can rank them that would be nice but if
you can’t, just list them in any order.
In two or three weeks I'll run the re-
sults here on The Back Page and we'll
find out once and for all ‘‘What is the
all-time favorite film at Washington
and Lee?’’ (Another one of those
burning questions that our parents are
spending $20,000 a year for us to find
out.)

To kind of start things off, here are
my top ten favorite films of all-time.
Remember, you're not choosing the
best of all-time. Choose your
favorites.

Tug’s Tag All-Time Top Ten

10. Whose Life is it Anyway? (1981,
Dir. John Badham)

Richard Dreyfuss gives what I think is
his tour de force performance as a
sculptor who becomes a quadroplegic
in a car accident and then argues that
he has the right to die if he so desires.
John Cassavetes and Christine Lahti
also give wonderful performances as
Dreyfuss’ doctors. The film is moving
and very powerful.

9. Moscow on the Hudson (1984, Dir.
Paul Mazursky)

Again choosing outstanding perfor-
mances, Robin Williams gives the
performance of his career in this
sleeper about a Russian circus musi-
cian who defects to the United States.
The film is excellent all the way
around, but Williams performance
makes it worth watching over and
over and over.

8. The Elephant Man (1980, Dir. Da-
vid Lynch)

Beautiful black and white film chroni-
cling the life of John Merrick, a
nineteenth century London man who
was so badly stricken with elephantia-
sis (a type of leprosy characterized by
swelling of the lymph glands) that he

was branded the Elephant Man and ta-
ken around to circus sideshows. John
Hurt plays Merrick beautifully as does
Anthony Hopkins as the doctor who
saves Merrick from the sideshow hor-
rors. Perfectly directed and filmed by
Lynch.

7. The Graduate (1967, Dir. Mike Ni-
chols)

No question one of America’s most
beloved films with Dustin Hoffman in
his film debut, Anne Bancroft and a
phenomenal score by Simon and Gar-
funkel. You've heard of ‘‘Every Col-
lege Boy’s Dream.’’ Well, this film
spells it out pretty clearly. Absolutely
hilarious. My hands down pick for
funniest film of all-time.

6. The Natural (1984, Dir. Barry Le-
vinson)

Definitely one of the most cliche films
ever made (although it doesn’t seem
like it as much after the Kirk Gibson
story in Game | of the World Series).
Beautiful film to watch and acted
superbly with Robert Redford, Glenn
Close, Kim Basinger, Wilford Brim-
ley, Robert Duvall, Barbara Hershey
and the rest of this all-star cast. One of
those movies that makes you stand up
and cheer even though you know
what’s going to happen.

5. The Godfather (1972, Dir. Francis
Ford Coppola)

What can you say? All-star cast that
put Robert Duvall, James Caan and Al
Pacino up for Best Supporting Actor
and of course put Brando up for Best
Actor which he won. There is very
little you can criticize this film for.
Consistently one of America’s
favorite films and rightly so. One of
the finest films ever made and by far
the finest film concerning the mafia.

4. Out of Africa (1985, Dir. Sydney
Pollack)

One of the most beautiful films ever
made due to the acting and the incre-
dible Oscar-winning cinematography.
Meryl Streep is absolutely pheno-
menal and were it not for the sym-

pathy vote for Geraldine Page at the
Oscars, Streep would have easily won
her third award. Klaus-Maria Bran-
dauer is equally good. Reford even
puts in a good performance.

3. Chariots of Fire (1981, Dir. Hugh
Hudson)

Beautiful British film about a runner
who refuses to run on Sunday in the
1924 Olympic Games. Beautifully
filmed and acted. Ben Cross and Ian
Charleson are wonderful in the leads.
Won Best Picture over Reds, Raiders
of the Lost Ark and On Golden Pond.
Inspiring music and cinematography
make this a film to move you and take
your breath away.

2. The Dresser (1983, Dir.
Yates)

Another beautiful British import about
an aging Shakespearean actor and his
valet in World War I London. Albert
Finney gives the performance of his
career as Sir, the aging, dying actor
who can never remember which role
he is performing as does Tom Cour-
tenay in the role of his dresser. The
film is more of a character study than
anything else and is a little slow but is
a wonderful watch.

1. E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982,
Steven Spielberg)

Yes, this is a cheesy pick for number
one and no, I’m not ashamed to say I
love this movie. I saw this movie three
times in one day and scary as that may
sound, I’m still not tired of it. I would
think that by now, everyone has seen
E.T., but if you haven’t you’re just in
time for the release of the videotape
version due to hit video stores this
week. This is one of the most heart-
t warming films ever made without
question and though it is already the
number one grossing film of all-time,
it will blow the roof off the list when
the videotape is released. It’s a feel-
good movie, it’s funny and with
Spielberg behind the controls some-
what believable. It’s absolutely...
well, rent it and see. I’m going to
stand in line at the video store.

Trustees pass fraternity renovation plan

4

 

by Heidi Read
Tri-Editor

 

The Board of Trustees last weekend
unanimously approved a $10 million
program designed to renovate the uni-
versity’s 17 fraternity houses.

The goal of the ‘‘Fraternity Renais-
sance Program’’ is to set uniform
standards in all the local chapters and
strengthen the fraternity system over-
all.

Thomas Touchton, chairman of the
trustees’ campus life committee,
called the action ‘‘the most important

\ decision since we voted to become

coeducational’’ in 1984.
W&L President John D. Wilson,

‘ who is on leave for fall term, wrote in

a memorandum ‘to the trustees,
‘Fraternities at Washington and Lee
) have a larger, more generous place in
the historic life of this institution.

‘‘Over the years, almost every stu-
\ dent belonged to one or another of the
houses, lived there and ate there,
made lasting friendships, enjoyed

Old tales told
of Halloween

* By Melinda Conkling
} Staff Reporter

 

 

The sounds of ‘‘Trick or Treat”’
soon will be upon Lexington, although
the signs of Halloween have been here
for a couple of weeks. The weather
_ has gotten colder, the leaves are
changing color and there’s a full moon
in the sky — and those are just
nature’s subtle hints! All around Lex-
ington one can see carved jack 0’ lan-
terns, fake spiders and monsters.

The holiday of Halloween,
_ however, did not originate with little
kids dressed in costumes running from
door to door asking for candy. It all
, Started more than 2,000 years ago in
what are now France and the British
isles. The celtic people held a festival
once a year to please their Lord of the
Dead. The Celtic priests burned peo-
ple alive, usually prisoners of war or
criminals, to pacify the Lord of the
Dead.

This also was a joyful time because
it meant the death of the old year and
the birth of a new. The harvest was
done and people celebrated the sun
, god, Baal, who had given them the
safely stored ripened grain.

r

-

In the first century before Christ,
the Romans invaded the Celts’ home-
land and extended the rule of the
Roman empire. The Romans also had
a festival for the dead and gradually

the two festivals became one. The
* Roman rulers were furious about the
« Celtic influence so they banned Celtic
practices. The Celts preserved their
traditions, though, and when Chris-
tianity entered the empire, the Chris-

>~

tian religion gave new meanings and
, ames to the Celts’ customs while not

obliterating them. The Celts believed
i the fire rites they had once held for the
_ Lord of the Dead would now protect
‘ them from the Devil, the enemy of the
( Christian church.

o

\ The 7th century saw the estab-
lishment of All Saints Day in May,
“although by the year 900 it was cele-
{brated on Nov. 1. The Celts still
,awaited the arrival of ghosts on Oct.
31, and they trembled in fear at any
\unusual sounds. And they still cele-
brated the tradition of ancient harvest
‘rituals by feasting and playing games.

The many holidays, All Saint’s Day
sand All Hallow’s Even, eventually
, merged into the one Halloween on
‘Oct. 31. The Scotch and Irish brought
cit to the United States in the 19th cen-
tury, complete with the Halloween
‘witch and cat, devils, ghosts and de-
(mons.

; Halloween is not just a time to get

* lots of candy; it originated from peo-

ple celebrating their harvest and hon-
,oring their dead. The black and or-
ange colors we traditionally recognize
‘as Halloween’s were derived from
harvest colors.

People started wearing masks in
Europe long after all the holidays had
‘merged into Halloween. They wanted
to be unrecognizable, just in case a
* ghost might want to get them. Until a
i few decades ago, boys and girls dres-
sed up as ghosts to scare the neigh-
bors, but no one went ‘‘trick or treat-
» ing.””

» About 40 years ago, neighbors be-
_ gan giving treats to their costumed
‘ visitors. Each Halloween thereafter,

1 more and more ghosts, witches, then

_ Martians, and then clowns began to
appear on doorsteps on Oct. 31. Thus,

_ know it today!

social occasions and learned how to
get things done in the world. Even to-
day a high percentage of male students
(80 percent) belong and much of our
social life revolves around the houses.
They are, on balance, worth saving,
as much for their past utility and im-
portance as for their promise.”’

At the foundation of the renaissance
program is a set of ‘*Standards for
Fraternities’’ adopted by the univer-
sity last year. The standards set forth
operating guidelines that define the
privileges and responsibilities of the
fraternity houses. They also specify
the physical standards to be met for
the interior and exterior condition of
the houses. The standards are manda-
tory and not optional guidelines. All
fraternities must be in full compliance
with the standards to be eligible to par-
ticipate in the renaissance program.

Acting University President John
Elrod said that the project has resulted
in the fraternities and the administra-
tion ‘‘pulling in the same direction.”’

**We should have it all down in two
to three months,’’ he said. Continu-

ing, Dean Elrod said he hoped the
renaissance project would ‘‘help
fraternities be better neighbors to each
other and the Lexington community,
restore the fraternities to what they
were intended to be and make the
houses more pleasing to look at.’’

According to Dean of Students
Lewis John, all fraternities were re-
quired to be in compliance with all but
the house physical standards by Sept.
15. He said when house renovations
are complete, the fraternities must
maintain the standards required in the
**Standards for Fraternities. ”’

Under the program approved by the
board of trustees, the university will
advance financing for the renovation
of the 17 fraternity houses. The
money will be returned to the univer-
sity over a period of time through
alumni gifts, rental payments and
Greek system student fees. The fi-
nancing program is not mandatory, so
any fraternity wanting to do its own
renovations is free to do so. However,
all fraternities—whether or not they
participate in the university's financ-

ing program— —must adhere to the uni-
versity’s ‘‘Standards for Fraterni-
ties,’ including requirements calling
for the physical renovation of the
fraternity houses.

According to Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy”’
Atkins, dean of greek affairs, all but
one fraternity are qualified to partici-
pate in the program if they choose.
But Dean Atkins said once that frater-
nity’s paperwork is turned in, it will
also be eligible to participate in the
renaissance project.

According to the plan, if a fraternity
applies for university financing, the ti-
tle for the fraternity house must be
deeded to the university. In return, the
university will absorb all current
mortgage balances and will manage
the renovations. W&L already owns
three fraternity houses, Chi Psi, Kap-
pa Sig and Sigma Nu, as well as the
land on which many of the houses are
situated, such as fraternities in Red
Square. Alumni corporations own the
Figi, Delta Tau Delta and Sigma Phi
Epsilon houses.

Once renovated, fraternity houses

Professor Alty, Amy Lehr, Esther Huffman, sary Hampson and Mary Alice McMorrow answer questions at the
Monday night discussion about sororities in Lee Chapel. A final decision on whether or not sororities will colonize at

WA&L will be made within the next 2

months.

Sororities still discussed

by Heather Midkiff
Staff Reporter

 

A last discussion on the advan-
tages and disadvantages of sororities
was held Monday night in Lee
Chapel. The surveys handed in by the
women after the forum will decide
whether or not sororities will begin to
colonize this year at W&L.

A panel of two pro-sorority and two
anti-sorority individuals was headed
by senior Esther Huffman in order for
the female students to hear and ex-
press their own opinions on the issue
of sororities.

Some students felt that bringing
sororities to the W&L campus would
be a good solution to the problem of a
lack of social outlet that they feel is
not affecting W&L women.

“*T was led to believe when I was
accepted that we could have what we
(the women) wanted — we could have
sororities ae -if. we wanted

them. I don’t think TRIDENT is ca-
pable of running the school any-
more,’’ said one senior.

As to the matter of whether or not
sororities would be a break in the tra-
dition at W&L, senior Stephanie
Smith said, ‘‘Who does this tradition
belong to? We are the tradition. You
(the women) aren’t lucky to be here—
you're here because you deserve it.
It’s time to stand up for yourself.”’

On the other hand, the basic consen-
sus of many of the women were feel-
ings of concern that they were being
rushed into an idea they weren’t ade-
quately prepared for.

One male in the audience pointed
out that the women ‘‘had a lot of in-
formation to digest. I can see that the
girls obviously need a social outlet,
but I don’t think you should jump into
something and have it fail; it might de-
triment the women’s movement for
the future.’’

Many of the women’s concerns,

‘*We (the United States) can’t af-
ford to forget the concerns of the Anti-
Federalists,"’ said U.S. Supreme
Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
in her lecture in Lee Chapel last
Thursday night.

She explained that the Anti-
Federalists were mostly farmers from
the western United States who argued
against the absence of a bill of rights.
They also argued that the federal
government would become too power-
ful and the states would become
powerless if the Constitution were ra-
tified.

O'Connor agreed, saying that the
answers to many problems lie in state
legislatures, not in Washington, BC;

In recent cases, such as Minneapolis
Star and Tribune Company v. Minne-
sota Commissioner of Revenue, the
U.S. Supreme Court has supported
the concerns that the Anti-Federalists
had, according to O'Connor. In this
case, the court declared it unconstitu

+A meee Nettle coe

tional to impose a tax (on paper and
ink) to restrict the freedom of the
press.

Keeping strong state governments
alongside a strong federal government
proved to be the perfect mix that ena-
bled the United States constitution to
be ratified and last for 200 years.

O'Connor spoke as the third Eli-
zabeth Lewis Otey lecturer, an annual
lecture that brings women of a-
chievement to the university.

O'Connor fits in this category since
she is the only woman to serve on the
highest court in the land. Through her
concurring and dissenting opinions,
she has helped to shape the laws that
govern the United States.

O'Connor has been an associate jus-
tice of the U.S. Supreme Court since
1981.

The day after her lecture, the
58-year-old O'Connor had breast can-
cer surgery at Georgetown University
Hospital. A Supreme Court spokes
woman said last week that O’Connor
is expected to make a “‘total recove
ry’ and should return to the bench by
the end of the month.

such as the amount of time and money
involved with sororities, are problems
that could be solved through further
education.

“If we have sororities now, there
would be a lot of confusion and tur-
moil. There are still too many girls
opposed to sororities,’’ said one soph-
omore.

One of the major concerns was sor-
orities breaking up the women at
W&L and turning them toward a ser-
ies of cliques.

Senior Class President Fray
McCormick told the women they
needed ‘‘to give themselves some cre-
dit. Sororities are not like beautiful,
idiotic girls here and cows over there.
You're selling yourselves short — I
have a lot of faith in the W&L girls.
You could use the Greek system —
you could use it to your advantage.”’

The surveys are now being tablu-
lated, and a decision on when and if
sororities will be coming to the W&L
campus will be made within the next
two months.

will be leased back to the house cor-
poration—a group of alumni who
Oversee the operation of the
house—with specific requirements for
maintenance and operation.

Other features of the program in-
clude:

~The university will provide prop-
erty insurance, maintenance, utilities
and custodial care.

—A portion of the lease/contract be-
tween the house and the university
will be directed to a repair and re-
placement reserve.

—Noncompliance at any time with

the ‘‘Standards for Fraternities’’ will
be cause for termination of the
lease/contract.

—A resident manager with specific
responsibilities will be required.

Dean Elrod said the university is
hoping to begin house renovations as
early as this summer, although re-
quired architectural planning and es-
sential clearances with the City of
Lexington could delay modifications
until a later period.

According to Dean John, four or
five houses could be renovated each

Executive

summer. However, the — selection
process is still undecided. He said the
renovation steering committee may
take applications on a first come, first
serve basis or by cluster—Red Square
or Washington Street houses

The renovation steering committee,

made up of students and members of
the administration, will meet on Nov.
11 to decide on specifics, such as the
applications procedure, Dean John
said. He also said the Alumni Frater
nity Council and house corporation
presidents will meet Nov. 19 to ex
plain procedures to individual chap
ters and discuss whether or not chap
ters want to apply for participation in
the program.

A project supervisor will be hired to
oversee the renaissance program.
That supervisor's responsibilities will
include working with the renovation
steering committee, the dean of stu-
dent’s office, the individual house
corporations and fraternity chapter
officers to oversee the development of
individual house plans as eligible
houses apply.

Notes:

No more flyers on colonnade

 

By Stacy Morrison
Staff Reporter

 

Flyers will no longer be permitted
to be posted on the colonnade after a
motion made by the Executive Com-
mittee at its Monday night meeting is
approved by the deans, said First-
Year Law EC Representative Mark A.
Cobb.

Cobb reported that Dean of Students
Lewis G. John wants ‘‘to get the
flyers off the columns and the fronts
of the buildings on the colonnade.”’
Cobb spoke to Dean John last week in
response to a request EC President
Christopher deMovellan received
from Senior David Burns.

Burns said the posters ‘‘detract’’
from the colonnade’s beauty, and
since the colonnade is a_ national
landmark, the flyers should go on the
campus bulletin boards.

Cobb said Dean John suggested
several options, such as more bulletin
boards on campus, or having a work
study student pull down outdated
flyers from the buildings. Buildings
and Grounds already removes posters
hung on the columns and doors.

DeMovellan said he wanted to see
all flyers completely off the colon-
nade. But, he said, ‘‘The question is,
where is the stuff going to go?”’

There are currently four bulletin
boards on campus. They are located in
front of the Co-op, behind Payne Hall,
in front of DuPont Hall, and in the
Graham-Lees Dormitory archway.
Cobb said students are allowed to post
flyers on the bulletin boards inside
each of the buildings on the colonnade
as well.

Sophomore EC Representative Wil-
lard Dumas suggested an additional
bulletin board be installed outside the
library, because there is such heavy
traffic there.

Cobb is drafting a letter stating that
posters are to be hung only on bulletin
boards. He will present the letter at
the next EC meeting on Monday
night.

In other business, deMovellan re-
ported on his meeting with the W&L
Board of Trustees last weekend. He

Library reports
missing books
and articles

By Eleanor Nelson
Staff Reporter

 

Missing books, jackets, calculators
and back packs do not surprise the
WAL librarian.

Students have reported missing arti-
cles from study carrels in the library
as well as the Commerce School li-
brary. Circulation librarian Peggy
Hayes said, ‘‘It seems to happen
spurts."’ The recent complaints are
not new to the librarians.

Since W&L leaves the library and
the academic buildings on campus
open 24-hours-a-day, it is difficult to
monitor who comes in and out of the
buildings. Because the library is a de
pository library, one that receives fed
eral documents for free, it must be ac
cessible to the public in this con
gressional district in addition to stu
dents.

‘Students need to take the honor
code seriously at all times, not just
when they are taking an exam. Regret

Get

InShape!

The average American is in poor physical condition. Extensive
media coverage of the ‘‘fitness boom’’ is enough to make it seem
. otherwise, but this fact is undeniable. While a small majority of
‘ elite athletes have used modern training and equipment to attain
amazing levels of fitness, most people have moved in the opposite
direction. The days when humans stayed in physical shape by using
their hands and feet to hunt and gather food, to build shelter and to
entertain themselves are gone. Today, a person with a sedentary
* job, a car, and a television can easily survive without physical acti-
vity. Of course, there is more to health than physical activity. Eat-
ing, sleeping, drinking and smoking habits, in addition to stress, are
also important variables.
By these standards, college students are very unhealthy. Few
“ exercise regularly and college is very conducive to the development
. of poor eating habits. Most college students sleep erratically and

many drink and

smoke excessively. The academic pressures and

change of lifestyle inherent to most campus environments make col-

lege very stressful.

If so many unhealthy people function in society, then what's the
point of exercising and living right? For one, it will increase your
life span. A long term study of Harvard alumni reported by the New
York Times in 1986 showed that ‘‘men who walked nine or more

_miles per week had a 21 percent lower risk of death than men who
_ walked less than three miles.’’ It also showed that the least active of
the older alumni are twice as likely to die as their very active

counterparts.
A Soviet study

reported by the United Press International blames

the low life expectancy rates of Soviet citizens on the fact that ‘‘less
than one-third of the population exercises regularly, 30 percent are
overweight, 70 million smoke, and heavy drinking is common.”’
There are twice as many fatal heart attacks in the Soviet Union as
-there are in Western European capitalist countries.

Besides increasing the length of life, a healthy lifestyle increases
the quality of life. Strenuous or even moderate exercise is a great
.way to relieve stress. Many fitness lovers put exercise on a spiritual

level. Exercise related body fatigue is a great way to relax the mind.
A regular exercise program will do more for most people than any

drastic change in

personal philosophy. A conditioned body is a de-

served source of self esteem and respect. Exercise is for everyone.
If you are not doing it on a regular schedule, I encourage you to
start. Find a sport or an exercise you enjoy and do it regularly. Start
slow and make sure it’s fun. The results will amaze you.

MY VIEW

I would like to begin by compli-
menting the Sorority Advisory Com-
mittee as a whole on the idea of hold-
ing an open forum. In addition to clar-
ifying the winter rush rumor (they will
only have winter rush if there is suffi-
cient interest, especially in the under-
classes), it allowed some of us — who
have been filling out ‘‘sorority inter-
est’’ questionnaires for four years and
are beginning to doubt anyone is
listening — to state our opinions. I
would also like to extend special
kudos to Esther Huffman who did an
excellent job as chairman (chairwo-
man, chairperson — take your pick).

The purpose of this letter is not to
debate the pros and cons of the soror-
ity issue (I will not even say which
side I support), but rather to question
the qualifications of some of those
who were chosen to sit on the panel —
specifically Professor Alty and Amy
Lehr. I would like to emphasize that
this is not a personal attack — I am
sure Ms. Alty and Ms. Lehr are per-
fectly wonderful individuals — I sim-
ply feel that they were completely un-
qualified to address the issue of sorori-
ties at Washington and Lee.

By Beckwith Archer

 

In the ongoing debate concerning
sororities at our school, I am of the
opinion that they should not be insti-
tuted at Washington and Lee. I am a
transfer student from the University of
Kentucky. I was a member of the Del-
ta Rho chapter of Delta Delta Delta,
and I am aware of the pros and cons
concerning sorority life.

Sororities are an important part of
the social life at a major university.
The enrollment of UK was 23,500
students as compared with W&L’s
1,600.

Through the sorority I became
friends with girls whom I probably
would not have ever seen on campus
in the four-year period that 1 was
there. We did a lot of things together
and were an entity unto ourselves. In
that sense, I suppose that the sorority
life offered a feeling of security. I al-
ways felt I had a place where I be-
longed. It was a home away from
home.

There are negative aspects,
however, which on the W&L campus
outweigh the positive ones. Sorority
rush is one of the most humiliating and
frustrating experiences for a freshman

 

 

member of the panel introduced them-
selves and explained why they were
chosen for the panel. Prof. Altyes qua-
lifications were simply that she had
been in a sorority in @bllegé "and
thought they would be a good thing to
start at W&L. My question is is: what
does a first year professor really know
about student life at W&L? Was she
here when W&L was all male? Was
she even here during the first few
years of The Great Female Infiltra-
tion? No. Then how can she possibly
understand the impact that sororities
would have on both the social life at
WA&L and on alumni relations? The is-
sue is not ‘‘are sororites a neatsy-keen
idea’’ but whether they are right for
WA&L, and/or are they right for W&L
at this time. She had little more to con-
tribute than a speech on how swell
sororities can be.

Amy Lehr was similarly unquali-
fied. Her ‘‘qualifications’’ were based
on the fact that she had been a member
of a sorority at Vanderbilt. (For those
who do not know, Ms. Lehr is a junior
transfer this year.) Again, her main
contribution to the forum was that she
loved being in a sorority and, gee
whiz, they were such fun. Forgive me
for saying this, but SO WHAT. That
does not prove that they are the right
thing for Washington and Lee. In-
deed, how can someone who has been
a student at W&L for less then two
months judge the effects a sorority

woman. Instead of being able to get
onto a campus and make a name for
yourself, you are immediately judged
by a group of women who know noth-
ing about you as a person.

From the rusher’s side, the situation
is even worse. We were expected to
sit and talk with a girl for 20 minutes
and based on that meeting, make a de-
cision that might affect her entire ex-
perience at the university.

This is a very traumatic time for
both the sororities and the rushees.
The former being torn between
hypocrisy and truth, and the latter try-
ing desperately to understand why
they were not accepted to the sorority
of their choice.

At a university the size of UK this
situation was aided by the sheer enor-
mity of the school. We found solace in
the fact that if we were lucky, we
would never have to see the girls that
we had excluded. The institution of
Washington and Lee does not foster
any of these attitudes. Hypocrisy and
avoidance are two evils that this uni-
versity seeks, through its teachings, to
eradicate.

Many argue that there is sisterhood
in sorority life, and to an extent this is
true. However, in reality, I feel that
this is a facade. The bonds exist sim-
ply because you wear the same letters.
Real sisterhood develops only from
true friendships. I also regret the

Co-ed Questions Committee

system would have here?

Having two such unqualified people
speak out for sororities only managed
to weaken the pro-sorority argument.
As a result, many persons who went to
the forum undecided to uninformed
left indisputably against a sorority
system at W&L. I do not think the
fault lies with the individuals (Ms.
Alty and Ms. Lehr) themselves, but
rather with whomever chose the panel
for the forum. Surely the organizer
could have found two women from the
senior or junior class, or even a guy,
who were more qualified to judge how
sororities would affect W&L and
whether the good effects would ou-
tweigh the bad ones. A student, for
example, who was around when the
move to co-education took place and
perhaps had some insight into the
changes (either through having
‘‘lived’’ through them, or because of
special alumni connections, which
enabled them to have known the ‘‘old
W&L’’). I know many such students
exist both in the senior class and the
junior class. If nothing else, they
would have been able to talk from
some basis of W&L experience. Such
a person’s opinions would have been
taken seriously and they would have
strengthened, rather than weakened,
the argument for sororities at W&L.

Again, I would like to compliment
the Sorority Advisory Committee on a
job, otherwise, well done.

Sorority Issue Simmers
| MY VIEW

many friendships that I missed out on
simply because the tri-Deltas were not
supposed to socialize with the Thetas
or the Kappas.

The list of baseless innuendos and
vicious rumors that spread among the
sororities was ridiculous. It is naive to
think that this sort of thing won’t hap-
pen at Washington and Lee should
sororities be instated. Many girls are
hurt and bitter about the rush process
and every sorority wants to be thought
of as the superior one. The backstab-
bing is inevitable.

I would also argue that there already
is a sisterhood at this university. We
are the women of Washington and
Lee. We have been brave enough to
come into a male-dominated institu-
tion, and I believe that we have estab-
lished ourselves very well. We have
seen a lot of changes in four years, not
the least of which is that we have been
accepted on campus and in the class-
room.

A sorority system on this campus
would cause a schism that would be ir-
reparable. The girls would become
divided and some would inevitably
have a feeling of superiority over oth-
ers. The clique situation would wor-
sen dramatically with girls associating
primarily with those in their same sor-
ority. I realize that there are several

A Great

MY VIEW
By Jon Sbar

 

 

In a very dangerous area of a big,
city in the middle of the night, the
Hell's Angels and the Better Business
Bureau threw a party. As motorcycle
maniacs and embezzling economists
settled down to a night of dangerous
drugs and wild women, a perceptive
participant made a stunning realiza-
tion. The two presidential candidates,
in addition to their vice presidential
nominees happened to be at this same
party. After some skillful lobbying
and threats of violence, the candidates
agreed to a debate. In order to give the
debate some degree of realism, two
brain dead members of the crowd
were chosen as panelists. As usual, f
happened to be in the right place at the
right time and recorded the entire de-
bate on the tape recorder I just hap“
pened to be holding. }

Question 1; From Mr. Rockhead,
a member of the Omaha Chapter of
the Hell’s Angels: Governor Duka
kis, if I ran over Kitty's face with my
Harley, raped her, and then cut her up
into little pieces and served her as an
h’ors d’oeuvre, would you recom-
mend giving me the death penalty?

Dukakis: No, I wouldn't. There are,
more effective ways of dealing with
criminals. I would revoke your
motorcycle license and put you on
probation. That way you might be’
able to reform and someday join the,
ACLU.

Mr. Rockhead:' Mr. Bush, what
would you do if I did the same thing to,
your wife?

Bush: I'd cut your heart out with a
machete before you even had a trial, ;
and I'd torture every living member of
your family by blocking their blood’
vessels with super glue.

Question 3, from Mr. Waffleface,’
senior partner at Waffleface and,
Son Accounting Firm: Senator
Quayle, if you had to be a garden‘
vegetable, which one would you be,
and why?

Quayle: Well, it’s funny you ask, :
but just the other day my 97-year-old.
grandmother told me I looked and ac-
ted like a rutabaga she planted as a‘
child. I would be a rutabaga because
Grandma says they can cure hemorr-
hoids and I have always been inter-;
ested in medicine.

Mr. Waffleface: Senator Bentsen, ,
do you believe in God?

Bentsen: Actually, Mr. Waffleface,
I worship the devil. I’ve found that Sa- ,
tan knows a h=ll of a lot about politics.
I realize that my religious beliefs may‘
seem to be at odds with Dukakis who
is a Zen Buddhist, but, remember, re-"
ligious tolerance is in the first.

Question 5, from Mr. Rockhead: ;
Senator Quayle, what was the most
recent book you read and what did it ’
teach you? '

Quayle: Three months ago I read
The Cat in the Hat by Dr. Seuss. It '
taught me that the anarchist society ,
advocated by the cat will only work
with the help of a strong military. '

Mr. Rockhead: What about your
favorite book, Senator Bentsen?

Bentsen: Unfortunately, I am one ;
of the 20 million functionally illiterate
Americans. :

Question 7 from Mr. Waffleface:
Mr. Bush, why is it so important that !
our children say the Pledge of Alle-
giance?

Bush: It is the only thing separating -
us from Communist countries: like |
Bulgaria.

Question 8 from Mr. Waffleface: ,
Governor Dukakis, how tall are you?

Dukakis: I’m 5°4°’, but Kitty thinks »
I may still be growing, just like Amer-
ica will grow under a Democratic ;
president.

Question 9 from Mr. Rockhead: ‘
Senator Quayle, aren't you a little |
young to be a vice president? I mean,
you don’t even have Alzheimer's '
Disease.

Quayle: Personally, I think good
presidents can be effective even if they ”
don’t have a disability.

‘

Question 10 from Mr. Rockhead: \
Senator Bentsen, if Dukakis became
president and was killed after being ‘
shot by Iranian terrorists, what steps ,
would you take as the new president?

Bentsen: Let's see. I'd probably
order a pizza with onions and extra
cheese. I'd also move my stereo into
the oval office and crank up some Led |
Zeppelin. And then I'd probably run,
through the White House wearing
nothing but a Stetson cowboy hat.

At this point, the debate was inter-
rupted permanently by irate members
of the crowd who began throwing

Wa&L may just be
in the movies

by Betsy Griffin
Staff Reporter

 

This summer, Washington and
Lee was considered as a possible site
for the production of a Walt Disney
film titled, ‘‘The Dead Poets’ So
ciety.
The stars Robin Williams
(’Moscow on the Hudson’’ and
“Good Morning Vietnam’’) and is
directed by Peter Weir (‘‘Wit-
ness’’and *‘The Year of Living Dang-
erously’’). It concerns a writer (Wil-
liams) who returns to his all-male prep
school to teach. When he was a stu
dent, he organized the ‘*‘Dead Poets’
Society’’ to read and study poets’
works. He is asked to reorganize the
society when he returns.
This summer, representatives from
the Virginia Film Office, which en-
couraged filmmakers to produce films
, in Virginia, examined several cam-

puses across the state as possible sites
» for the movie. They also visited Mary
, Baldwin College, University of Vir-
‘ ginia, Hollins College, Roanoke Col-
\lege and the preparatory schools:

Stuart Hall, the Miller School and the
‘ Madeira School.

Representatives from the Virginia
Film Office and Walt Disney Pictures
‘spent six hours looking at W&L on
July 24. They were looking for a cam-
pus that was “‘striking architectural-

movie

They also were looking for class-
rooms that were typical of the late
1950s, such as the ones in Robinson
Hall. They also examined Lee Chapel
and Evans Dining Hall. The rep-
resentatives who visited were ‘‘very
impressed’’ and thought W&L was
the best of all the places they had
visited.

In early September, Peter Weir and
five representatives from Walt Disney
visited for about three hours. Weir felt
that W&L was too large to give the
appearance of a 300-student prep
school. They decided to film the mo-
vie at St. Andrews School in Delaw-
are.

W&L, however, will continue to be
considered as a possible location for
motion pictures. W&L News Office
Director Brian Shaw said, “‘It is the
university’s policy to cooperate as
much as we can with the film office.’’
Shaw also said the filming of a movie
at W&L ‘‘would be an educational
experience. Both the presence of a
movie crew on campus and the possi-
bility of participating in the produc-
tion, would be beneficial to W&L stu-
dents.””

There has been discussion of film-
ing ‘‘The Foreign Student,’’ based on
Philippe Labro’s book. The Thom
Mont Company, which produced
‘*Bull Durham’’ purchased the film
rights to Labro’s book. However, no
contracts have been made concerning
the film site.

Life in the Fast Lane

by Debbie Grove
Staff Reporter

 

 

The Fast Lane, Lexington’s new
bowling alley, is doing ‘‘extremely
well,’ according to Wayne Heslep,
‘president of Lois Lanes Inc., which
owns the alley. He added, ‘‘The re-
‘sponse has been extremely good —
‘way ahead of all our projections.’

The Fast Lane is located on U.S. 11

. North, one mile past the intersection
of 11 and interstate 64. Heslep said
there currently are 16 lanes, but 8 to
10 more lanes may be added this
\spring. The facility boasts a game
room, snack bar and computerized
‘scoring of the games.

Heslep said the bowling alley is
successful because ‘‘there are not
many things to do around here.
‘Bowling is something just about
anyone can do, it’s inexpensive and
it’s fun.”’

He said over the years there has
been an effort vy a number of people
‘

 

to build a bowling alley, but because
of financial difficulties, the idea never
go past the drawing board.

The Fast Lanes’ manager, Butch
McClamma, said The Fast Lane is
open from noon until midnight Mon-
day through Thursday and noon until
2 a.m. on Fridays. On Fridays,
McClamma said there is a special
“moonlight bowling’’ during which
the lights are turned off. On Satur-
days, The Fast Lane is open from 9
a.m. to 1 a.m., and Sundays it’s open
from noon until midnight.

Because of the formation of bowling
leagues, McClamma said the hours
for open bowling are from noon until
5 p.m. every day. All day Wednesday
and Saturday after 3 p.m. are open, as
well as Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,
Friday and Sunday evenings after
9:30.

Bowling costs $1.50 per person, per
game from noon until 5 p.m., and
$1.85 after 5 p.m. Shoe rental is 95
cents at all times

 

 

 

 

 

  

“Do any of you have a drinking
problem? Raise your hand.’’... No
one raises their hand. ‘‘Has anyone
ever thrown up drinking before?
Raise your hand.’’... Three-fourths
of the people raise their hand. ‘‘Do
any of you have a drinking prob-
lem?’’... Everyone has a puzzled
look. ‘‘I consider throwing up a
problem. Do you?’’... Everyone

laughs...

On Friday, Oct. 21, this dialogue in
Lee Chapel between Mike Green and
the audience began the discussion of
alcohol abuse. Green’s message to the
W&L community and the 10 other
schools he visited during the National
Collegiate Alcohol Awareness Week
was one of moderation and safety.
Although his message ‘was intended to
educate, it did not dictate. As one stu-
dent, Mike Malloy, said, ‘‘He was on
the level of the students. He talked

with you, not at you.”’

Also atypical of alcohol programs,
Green did not suggest that students
stop drinking altogether, and even
admitted that some of his best times
with college football ‘‘buddies’’ were
spent drinking. However, as a re-
covering alcoholic, he did stress that
drinking can get out of hand and he
was speaking to pass on some tips on
how not to let drinking become a prob-
lem. He said, *‘I don’t want anyone to
have to go through what I went
through.’’ Another student, Allen
Ferguson, said, ‘‘It was neat how his
emphasis was on how to drink, not
how not to drink.”’

Green’s first tip was not to succumb
to the ‘‘power of suggestion.”’ Stu-
dents shouldn’t let roommates or
friends con them into believing they
need a drink. Drinking to mask prob-
lems or recover from a hard day is
probably the worst time for us to
drink, Green said.

Green's second tip was not to sur-
render to peer pressure. Although stu-
dents might not think that peer pres-
sure is a ‘‘big deal,”’ all it takes is one

g up a problem?

person at a party to start yelling
“‘chug’’ and then everyone starts yell-

ing ‘‘chug’? and so
**chugs.”’

Green’s third tip was to avoid the
“*gets.’’ He asked how anyone could
enjoy a feeling that is described as tra-
shed, hammered, fried, s.faced, and

that person

‘f'dup.

The final words of advice that
Green left were on the 2-H.A.L.T.
TIPS that are part of a promotional
t-shirt for the Philadelphia Flyers.

First, drink only two drinks per
hour, a drink being a 12-oz. can of
beer, a 3-oz. glass of wine, or a mixed
shot. The body can neutralize one
drink per hour and the second drink
may give you a nice ‘‘buzz,”’ but at
least it’s out of the .01 legal intoxica-
tion range. Also, avoid drinking if you
are hungry; it will make you Hungrier
and Heavier. Don’t drink when you’ re
Angry or Lonely because your emo-
tions are intensified and you may
either hurt yourself or someone else.
And don’t drink when you’ re Tired.

Gladys Steele and her shelter for the
homeless prepare for the winter months

Se REA | SEAS CRITE,
by Caly Smith

Staff Reporter

 

Coming up on its third winter, Gla-
dys House Inc., on Varner Lane,
opens for the homeless Nov. |. This
year the shelter is again seeking assis-
tance from volunteers, such as church
groups, students and local individuals.
Gladys Steele, who operates the shel-
ter out of her home, says her house is
open to anyone who comes.

The shelter operation provides the
homeless with two meals a day.
Church groups have been the main
providers of the evening hot meal and
breakfast funds have been provided by
the shelter committee. Night vol-
unteers stay overnight in the shelter to
answer the door and enforce the rules.
According to John Hall, a W&L law
student and volunteer coordinator,
‘*The commitment of a volunteer isn’t
very substantial and the experience is
worthwhile and rewarding.”’

In the winter months, the commun-
ity has been the main source of dona-
tions to the shelter. During the sum-

mer months, Steele has maintained the
shelter, using her own money and
energy to provide for those in need.
She said, ‘‘I don’t think the commun-
ity is aware that there are as many
homeless in the summer as in the win-
ter. I try to do the best I can, but it is
hard going it alone, relying on my
own limited energy and finances.’

The shelter rules prohibit alcohol,
weapons, violence and smoking up-
stairs. Those persons desiring to eat
must be in the shelter by 5 p.m. to
receive a hot meal and lights are out at
11 p.m. The homeless are expected to
be out of the shelter by the time the
volunteer leaves in the morning;
however, when the weather is cold,
there is no set time one must leave.
Steele said she has never had a prob-
lem with people defying the rules.

The shelter consists of two large
rooms upstairs, a bathroom and a
small sitting area for meals and telev-
ision. The shelter can hold 10 people
comfortably, but Steele has allowed
19 to stay the night. Cots are provided
by Virginia Military Institute and
VMI staffs the program every Satur-

 

TALKBACK

   

day, according to Steele.

Hall said that on a national scale,
the majority of homeless suffer from
substance abuse or mental illness.
Hall, involved with shelters for six
years, said, ‘‘I’ve never run across a
person who wasn’t grateful, kind or
who I couldn’t be a friend to.’’ He
also said that the committee is looking
for people who are interested in help-
ing, especially student volunteers will-
ing to spend the night.

In the near future, the committee
hopes to build a new shelter. Presen-
tly, the committee possesses property
on Moore Street, but does not have the
money to build a shelter. Steele hopes
to pool together W&L resources in
order to sponsor a fund drive. She
said, ‘‘I hope W&L will contribute to
this cause because the university is so
good with fundraising.’’ In addition,
Steele said her house will only last one
more winter due to its age. Thus, the
new shelter may become a necessity.

Steele said last year she and her
family fed 30 people on Thanksgiv-

the work is worthwhile.

Sororities

 

(continued from page 2)

groups already on campus that are
fairly exclusive, yet sororities will
only enhance that situation. There is
also a problem with the fraternities.
Do not think that once there are soror-
ities that our days of freedom to attend
any fraternity party will continue. The
fraternities will invite one or two of
the sororities at a time to the house for
parties, and although other girls may
be allowed to attend, it is not a lot of
fun to go to a party where others know
that you were not invited.

I also have heard the argument that
life is not fair and that every situation
we encounter from now on will not
necessarily be pleasant. My counter to
this statement would be why, if life is
definitely going to deal us harsh
blows, should we subject ourselves to
self-imposed inequalities? University
life is not reality and it is pointless for
us to try to argue that it is or that we
should make it so.

As an alternative to the sororities, I
would advocate eating clubs for
women, common among Ivy League
universities. The girls would be free
to go and sign up in a house where
they feel the most comfortable, and
with the girls whom they believe that
they have the most in common. Much
of the dissention and anger could be
avoided in this way.

Washington and Lee is a very small
school. I believe part of its charm lies
in its size and the cohesiveness of the
student body. We are a sorority unto
ourselves, and there are not enough
women at this school for us to allow
this controversy to cause dissention.
The fact that the body of female stu-
Cents is so torn over this issue should
be an indicator that this is not the time
for the institition of sororities at
Washington and Lee. At a big univer-
sity, identity is based on your Greek
letters. The only letters that the
women of this school need are W and

City Hall makes
a new proposal

By Cindy Phoa
Staff Reporter

 

Lexington City Council submitted a
proposal to the Rockbridge County
Board of Supervisors to consolidate
the city and county government of-
fices by renovating and adding to the
existing county offices in Courthouse
Square on West Main Street.

The proposed ‘‘Rockbridge Area
Court and Office Complex’ would
provide badly needed court facilities
for both governments and administra-
tive office spaces for the county.

The city based its proposal on the
belief that only with cooperative
efforts could the governments of Lex-
ington and Rockbridge County, ac-
cording to the new City Hall proposal,
“‘maintain efficient government oper-
ations and enhance quality of life for
all area residents."’ City officials be-
lieve their proposal to be more benefi-
cial than the considerations by the
County Board of Supervisors to con-
struct new facilities near the regional
jail; they believe, despite difficulties
in developing the downtown area, the
offices need to be maintained in their
historic location.

Courthouse Square has been the site
of Rockbridge County government for
nearly 200 years, and the city’s plans
would preserve the square and the

county jail.
Plans include: purchasing First

Sprunt exhibits art

 

Staff Report

 

More than 50 recent paintings and
drawings of local artist Elise Sprunt
will be on exhibit in the Conference
Room Gallery of Washington and Lee
University’s Commerce School from
Nov. 5 to Dec. 31.

Sprunt’s paintings over the past 30
years have largely been private com-
missions and include portraits, scenes
of clients’ homes or their favorite
views of House Mountain and the
Blue Ridge Mountains. Her recent
work is focused on subjects of imme-
diate personal interest to her: the gar-
den and setting of Old Glasgow Farm,
her home on South River in Rock-
bridge County, where she and her
husband, David Sprunt, have lived for
20 years.

Sprunt says of her recent works,
‘‘What interests me is color, and the
power of light in it to evoke feeling or
response. An emotional response to
the sudden rediscovery of the visible
world in some particular aspect of vi-
vid color and/or luminous shadow, is
of more interest than a precise, literal

Marshall Kirkland **Kirk’’ Follo, a
1967 Washington and Lee graduate
and instructor in German at W&L
since 1981, has been appointed to
direct the W&L Outing Club.

In addition to working with the out-
ing club, Follo will continue to teach
one class per term in intermediate
German and serve as foreign studies
coordinator, where he will advise stu-
dents wishing to participate in
non-W&L-sponsored foreign studies
and summer abroad programs.

Although Washington and Lee has
sponsored outing programs and pro-
vided outdoor equipment for a number
of years, a recent rise in student inter-
est has prompted the university to fu-

hope, to the viewer of my work.’’

Sprunt, the daughter of the Rev.
McE. Miller, originally of Rock-
bridge Baths, grew up in Philadelphia.
She received her education there and
also received a bachelor’s degree in
art history in 1953 at Wellesley Col-
lege.

Her art training has been through a
variety of agencies, from private les-
sons as a teenager to one year at the
Art Students League and two indepen-
dent painting courses at James Ma-
dison University.

In addition to raising a family,
Sprunt has pursued her interest in art,
exhibiting in a number of local and re-
gional shows and receiving several
prizes and some awards for ‘‘best in
show.”’

She was one of the founding mem-

Follo already has organized white-
water rafting trips to West Virginia,
hiking trips to House Mountain
and the Blue Ridge, and has many
other activities in the planning stages.
‘*Response has been very good so
far,’’ says Follo. ‘*During registration
at the beginning of the year, more than
180 students signed up for outing club
activities. My hope is that the club
will bring students, and also members
of the faculty and staff, together out-
side the classroom. ”’

Organizing trips, offering basic in-
struction, and providing equipment
for students to use on their own are the
main services the outing club will
offer. Canoeing, camping, hiking, cy-

American Bank and the land behind it
that extends to Randolph Street, then
renovate the existing building to add
on a new addition; the county jail
would also be renovated and connec-
ted to the new extension. A problem
facing the proposal is the lack of ade-
quate parking. City officials,
however, have suggested a plan pro-
viding 160 new and 52 improved park-
ing spaces.

The complex would be owned and
operated by the Industrial De-
velopment Authorities of both the
Lexington and Rockbridge County
governments, and the IDA would
reimburse their investment by leasing
the office space at sufficient rates to
recover initial expenditures, and to
maintain and operate the buildings.

The cost of renovations is estimated
at over $3.1 million, and an annual
collection of approximately $3000
would be needed to adequately cover
costs. Therefore, the residents of the
complex, the city, the county and First
American Bank, would be expected to
pay $8.44 per square foot leased each
year.

Lexington’s annual expense is esti-
mated at $122,887 per year, and
Rockbridge County would be expec-
ted to pay $164,842 per year.

City manager Joseph King said
plans have not solidified enough to
discuss anything definite, but he said
the building would be suitable for
housing. The proposal made in Au-
gust suggests the space may be made
available for sorority housing.

Academic standards rise

 

by Laura Dodge
Staff Reporter

 

It has been four years. Four years
since Washington and Lee became a
co-educational university. Economic
and sociological reasons played a
large role in the co-ed decision.
Within four years, applications and
enrollment have changed, exhibiting
the success of W&L’s academic stan-
dards.

In 1974, the number of enrolled
undergraduates was 1,327. This year
1,608 have enrolled for the 1988-89
academic year. Applications have in-
creased as well. The first year W&L
went co-ed, applications jumped 76
percent. Applicants for the 1987-88
year numbered 3,336, while last year
3,222 applied. According to Dean
John Elrod, the admissions office ac-
cepted 947 in 1988, and 46 to 48 per-
cent usually enroll.

After students enroll in the univer-
sity, they may transfer out during their’
four (or five) year education. W&L,,
however, ma‘ntains a high retention
rate. Elrod said, ‘*The retention rate!
has increased quite a bit.’

The 1988 graduating class has a 7
percent retention rate; this year the‘
number is 83 percent. The numbers ,
are even higher for the current soph--
omore and junior classes. The class of }
1990 has an 89 percent retention rate ‘
and the class of 1991 is 96 percent.

Elrod said, ‘‘(It) is interesting that ;
the retention rate has gone up. It is ac-
tually a surprise. Since we had!
planned to open the year up withy
1,500, but 1,608 enrolled.*’

Most applicants are from Virginia, ’
followed by New Jersey and Texas.

‘““Boyd’s Boys’’ kicked some butt
Saturday afternoon.

Keyed by the outstanding play of
Washington and Lee’s defensive front
line, the Generals turned in a com-
manding 21-point shutout of Sewanee,
and irascible defensive-line coach
“Boyd Williams, who has been none-
to-fond of the University of the South
for most of his 35 seasons of coaching
Generals’ football, is rumored to have
cracked a smile over the outstanding
play of his ‘‘boys’’ — who played
more like men.

The defense was strong throughout
the game, but the W&L offensive and
special teams did everything they
could to give Sewanee the early lead.
The Generals won the coin toss, and
freshman David Harper took the open-
ing kickoff 15 yards before fumbling
at the W&L 22. But the Tigers failed
tg cash in on the turnover — W&L
sophomore defensive back Clark
Wight picked off a Sewanee pass on
second down to make up for the Har-
per fumble.

‘But the W&L offense would not be
denied its Opportunity to give away
points. Three plays into W&L’s first
drive of the game, Sewanee line-
backer Robert Black intercepted a
pass from junior quarterback Phil
Sampson, and the Tigers took over at

the W&L 37.

The Sewanee offense drove 36
yards in nine plays, despite a sack by
senior defensive tackle Jim Johnson.
Then, with first and goal from the
one, freshman running back Alan
Broom was stopped for no gain. After
a false start on second down cost the
Tigers five yards, running back Mark
Barineau reached the one on a sweep.
But W&L stopped Sewanee for no
gain on two straight plays, and the
Generals took over on downs.

The offense remained stagnant.
After junior fullback Russell Crosby
picked up four yards on first down,
Waskiewicz was stopped for no gain
and Sampson threw an_ incomplete
pass that sent in senior Tom Skeen to
punt out of his own end zone.

The W&L defenders should have
been exhausted by now, but they wer-
en’t. After Sewanee again drove to the
W&L 1, the Generals forced a fumble
by Broom, and senior lineman Hughes
Melton recovered.

After an exchange of punts, the
W&L offense finally came to life.
Starting at their own 22, the Generals
drove to their 45, where sophomore
running back Mason Pope took a han-
doff from junior quarterback Chris
Smythe. Pope, who rushed for 114
yards on 18 carries in the game, cut
left and out-ran the Sewanee defense
for the game’s first touchdown.
Quayle kicked the extra point that
gave the Generals a 7-0 lead — a lead

\In cross country, nothing helps your
team more than grabbing first place.
On Saturday, the Washington and Lee
men’s cross country team received
that as well as an added plus in its
25-30 defeat of Old Dominion Athle-
ti¢ Conference rival Bridgewater.

ft was no surprise to the Generals
when senior co-captain Bill Clark was
fifst to cross the finish line, smoking
Bridgewater's 5-mile course in 27:45,

at was unexpected, however, was
the performance of freshman Lee Par-
ker. Passing two Bridgewater runners
in the final 200 yards, Parker took
sevond place in 28:31 and almost as-
sured the Generals of victory.

‘*He ran well. That was his best
performance of the year,”’ said head
cgach Dick Miller of Parker’s race.

Both he and[freshman | Charles Ed-
wards have come along real well.*’

Edwards, who has been the No. 2
runner for W&L for most of. the
season, had somewhat of an off-day
but still managed to finish fifth in a
tithe of 29:13. Junior Joe Geitner (7th,

29:46) and freshman William Benson
(10th, 30:53) were the other scorers
for the Generals, W&L, 5-3, also
picked up a forfeit victory from West
Virginia Tech.

Miller, considering how far ahead
the Generals finished in front of
Bridgewater at the Virginia State Meet
a week earlier, seemed slightly sur-
prised by the closeness of the meet.

But it was Parker’s impressive kick
that really caught the coach off guard.
**T didn’t think he had enough speed to
do that because he hasn’t shown that
much speed in previous meets,’’ he
said.

The W&L women’s team picked up
a forfeit victory from West Virginia
Tech as well on Saturday, raising its
record to 4- 3.

Next up for the Generals is a trip to
Harrisonburg Saturday for an impor-
tant tri-meet that includes ODAC-foes
Eastern Mennonite and Hampden-
Sydney for the men, and Eastern
Mennonite and Lynchburg for the
women. The meets will be a final
tune-up for both teams before the
ODAC championships on Nov. 5.

they would never relinquish — with
12:02 left in the half.

After fielding Quayle’s kickoff,
Sewanee fumbled on its first play
from scrimmage, and Skeen, playing
linebacker, recovered at the Sewanee
a.

By now, the W&L offense was roll-
ing. Smythe led the Generals on a
nine-play drive and scored from
l-yard out with 7:23 remaining, and
Quayle’s extra point made the score
14-0.

Despite a slow offensive start,
W&L dominated the halftime stats.
The Generals had nearly doubled the
Tigers in total offensive yards
(181-95) through the first two periods
and had limited the Tigers to 41 pass-
ing yards, less than a quarter of their
166.5 yards-per-game average.

The second half saw more of the
same. The Tigers were able to crank
out some offense but crossed the
W&L 20-yard line only once and
never crossed the 15. A 14-yard run
by Pope with 1:43 left in the third
quarter capped a nine-play, 68-yard
drive and put the game out of reach
for good. Quayle kicked the point
after for a 21-0 W&L lead.

The defense held on the rest of the
way. Wight intercepted his second
pass of the day with 13 seconds left,
and it was then that coach Williams
probably thought about smiling. His
‘“‘boys’’ had dominated in W&L’s
second shutout of the season.

Sweet Briar

The sun finally peeked through the
clouds at the end of Tuesday’s
women’s soccer match between Wash-
ington and Lee and Sweet Briar in the
first-round of the Old Dominion Ath-
letic Conference Tournament. Unfor-
tunately for the Generals, that brief
moment of sunshine turned out to be
the only bright spot during what was a
dark and gloomy afternoon for W&L
up on the Liberty Hall Fields.

Despite dominating the action for
much of the 90-minute contest, the
Generals lost 2-1. It was a game that,
accorting te‘head coach Jan Hathorn,
W&L should have won.

The Generals outshot Sweet Briar
32-6 and had at least four times as
many scoring chances. After a score-
less first half, W&L junior Sarah T.

Allen lofted a shot past Sweet Briar
goalie Keri Chrisman with 43 minutes
remaining in the second half. Con-
sidering the way the Generals were
playing, a one-goal lead probably
looked like five to Sweet Briar.

But the visitors capitalized when
they had the opportunities. Michelle
Lennane, Sweet Briar’s leading
scorer, connected on a direct kick
with 25 minutes left, beating W&L
goalie Sherri Brown with a shot to the
upper right-hand corner of the goal.

Suddenly, overtime seemed a likely
possibility as the Generals peppered
Chrisman with shots but were unable
to find the back of the net.

‘They had an outstanding goalie
today,’’ Hathorn said of Chrisman,
who normally plays a wing positon.

was, I think it would have been a

Men tie top-ranked Macon

It was Wednesday afternoon, and
the Washington and Lee men’s soccer
team was getting ready to play Ran-
dolph-Macon.

Nothing new for the Generals, ex-
cept that Randolph-Macon is ranked
in the Division II Top 20. That makes
the fifth team that W&L has played
that has been ranked. The other four
were Johns Hopkins, Messiah, North
Carolina Wesleyan and Mary Wash-
ington.

In the Mary Washington game last
Wednesday, the Generals were, ac-
cording to head coach Rolf Piranian,
“beaten by a real good team. Accord-
ing to them, it was the best game that
they had played.”’

The final score was 4-0, the fourth
time the Generals had been shut out
this year. No matter how Mary Wash-
ington played, Piranian was not at all
pleased with the Generals’ perfor-
mance. *‘I wasn’t high on our perfor-
mance. I didn’t see that we played
well at all. We're not getting the kind
of effort I'm expecting. We just didn’t

put together 90 minutes of effort.”’

The loss dropped the Generals to
5-5-1, but the team got back over the
.500 mark with a 3-0 win over Wash-
ington College on Friday afternoon.

Seniors accounted for all the scor-
ing. Johnny Sarber scored two goals
and had an assist. Co-captain Mike
Veliuona scored and had an assist, and
Jamie Urso had an assist.

Yesterday, the Generals came away
with a 1-1 tie against Randolph-
Macon on the Liberty Hall Fields.
Freshman David Hooker scored 18
minutes into the game to give the
Generals a 1-0 lead that lasted until
there were 13 minutes left in regula-
tion play.

With three games left in the season,
Piranian said the team is positive of
the position they are in. ‘*We are posi-
tive of where we are.’ he said. ‘‘We
would like to have a settled lineup and
substitution scheme, but I can’t say
we're there yet. We're still moving
forward, playing some stretches
where I like what I’m seeing.”

The Generals’ next home game is
Tuesday at 3:00 p.m. against Lynch-
burg.

has been all year. It was typical.’’

It still looked like the Generals
could pull it off, but then came The
Call. With just under six minutes re-
maining, one of the two officials ruled
a General had committed a flagrant
foul in the 18-yard box, thus awarding
Sweet Briar a penalty shot.

“It’s just a subjective call and he
called it the way he saw it,’’ Hathorn
said. ‘‘It’s the kind of call that’s going
to lose a game for a team. That’s the
kind of call that an official should just
stay off his whistle, unless he really
thinks it was a blatant, terrible thing.
It wasn’t, but that’s the way he
thought it had to be called and he did
what he had to do.”’

Laura Mangus took the free direct
kick and knocked in the game-winner
past Brown.

The Generals came into the game
with plenty of momentum, scoring an
incredible come-from-behind victory

Broadway actress Lucy Martin stars in
W&L production of “‘Steel Magnolias”

 

Staff Report

The Washington and Lee University
Theatre’s first production of the
season, Robert Harling’s ‘*Steel Mag
will feature Broadway ac
tress Lucy Martin as the guest artist.

Martin, whose acting career has in-
cluded roles in the Broadway produc-
tions of Children of a Lesser God,
Shelter, The Unknown Soldier and His
Wife, Breaking the Code, Pygmailion,
Noises Off and Agnes of God, also has
appeared on television and in off-
Broadway and regional theaters across
the country. For five years, she ap-
peared as Tiffany in the daytime
serial, The Edge of Night.

A native of New York City, Martin
still lives there with her husband,
Broadway stage manager Jack Gian-
ini, and their three children. She is
spending a month at Washington and
Lee as artist-in-residence. Martin will
play the role of Truvy in *‘Steel Mag-
nolias,”’ a hilarious but sentimental
play about six women. The play is set
in Truvy’s beauty parlor in the carport
of her house in Louisiana.

drama at W&L and director of **Steel

sional actress like Martin raises the
quality of an entire production “Lu
cy’s presence and experience cause
everybody else to rise to her level.”
he says.

Ziegler chose Martin especially for
the part of Truvy. Through a mutual
New York friend, he was able to catch
her bewteen acting jobs to come to
Washington and Lee to serve as a
guest artist. Martin in Washington and
Lee’s first guest actor in recent years,
although each year the theater has had
a guest director of choreographer.

Joining Martin in the play are three
local actresses, Betty Kahn Taylor,
April Watts and Ginger McNeese, and
two W&L drama students, Zan Streib
and Monica Burke. ‘Although Truvy
is not a leading character, she is the
cement of the whole piece,"* says Zie
gler, who describes the play as an
‘‘ensemble piece. As the owner of the
beauty shop, she is the center of all ac-
tivity.””

‘Steel Magnolias’? currently is
playing off-Broadway in New York,
and after more than 500 performan-
ces, is still playing to sell-out audien-
ces. A move, which will be released
next year, is in the making with Dolly
Parton playing the role of Truvy.

Martin sees W&L’s production as
‘‘a very nice group effort.’’ She says

of the cast members, ‘‘Everybody is
commenting on everybody else. It’s a
wonderful learning experience for the
students."

A month spent in the Shenandoah
Valley is a welcome change for Mar
in. ‘I love being a guest artist,”” she
says. ‘‘When you come into a univer-
sity situation, the ground rules are a
little different. You put aside certain
rules. It's much more relaxed, more
laid back, especially at the undergra-
duate level.’ In addition to starring in
the play, Martin has been lecturing
and critiquing students in W&L’s act-
ing and directing classes.

Martin has served frequently as a
guest artist, but only one other time in
a university setting. There, she
worked with graduate students instead
of undergraduates. ‘‘It was more of a
conservatory situation with much
more competition among the students.
Instead of a learning experience, it
was more of a weeding out process,”
she remembers. ‘‘This is much more
fun.”

Martin says she sees ‘‘good things
happening’ in the drama department
at Washington and Lee. ‘So many
theaters are run on a_ shoestring.
W&L’s theater is better equipped than
some I’ve worked in New York (ex-

cluding Broadway). The technical as-

pect is terrific.”

The theater has played a major role
in Martin’s life. Growing up in New
York with parents who both worked in
thf theater probably influenced her
decision to pursue a career in acting,
she says. When she graduated from
Sweet Briar College, she was one of
three drama majors. All three still are
acting.

Martin colleges and uni-
versities as serving a major role in the
future of the arts in America. ‘‘They
are education the future philanthro-
pists of the country,’’ she says. **Un-
iversities, like Washington and Lee,
must be willing to support the arts and
must bring the arts to everybody's at-
tention. By not doing this, colleges are
not serving the world properly.”

Martin continued, *‘We are encoun-
tering a generation of consumers who
spend money on other forms of enter-
tainment, but do not buy artwork, or
go to the theater, or visit the museum.
This is a trend that is threatening the
survival of the arts.””

VOLUME 88, NO. 8

 

By Eleanor Nelson
Staff Reporter

 

National Sororities will begin colon-
izing on the W&L campus in January
1989.

The Sorority Advisory Committee
voted on the decision on Tuesday,
Nov.1, after discussing the results of
the Sorority Interest Survey. There
are 116 women who responded they
would rush if the sororities came this
winter.

The survey was mailed to all under-
graduate women. Of the approximate
500 women contacted, 219 returned
the survey. The majority response

* (116 votes) was for the colonization of

:

sororities. There are 95 women who

}

ties.
The survey included a question for

_ those women against sororities; they

¢ ities they would support. The alterna-

tives women voted on were : eating

clubs (received 27 votes), Trident
(received 37 votes) and Co- ed Inde-
pendent Union (received 27 votes).
The option of no women’s organiza-
tion needed received 15 votes.

The Sorority Advisory Committee,
comprised of students, faculty and
administration, stressed many times
throughout the meeting that the colon-
ization of sororities will not eliminate
the existing organizations for women,
nor will it eliminate the possibility of
other organizations to come to the
campus.

‘‘We are simply responding posi-
tively to the need expressed by these
116 women,”’ said Dean of Greek Af-
fairs Leroy ‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins. The de-
cision to form sororities this winter
does not close the options for other
opportunities to be formed in the fu-
ture.

The advisory committee will con-
sider the three sororities women men-
tioned on their surveys and will con-
sider the research they have done on
sororities that have contacted W&L.

They will ask the National Director
for Extension of National Sororities,
Mrs. William Bradford, how many
should come to W&L.

Experience at other schools that
have recently colonized national sor-
orities, such as the University of
Richmond, indicates that more than
116 women will pre-register to rush.
At Richmond over twice as many
women rushed as the preliminary sur-
veys indicated.

The committee will invite twice as
many sororities to give presentations
than will actually come; from this
group they will decide which sorori-
ties will colonize at W&L. They will
take into consideration the funding the
sorority would provide, its policies for
extension, its dues, and the proximity
of chapters.

In late January the committee esti-
mates rush will begin for all classes of
women interested.

W&L expects 1700 at 34th
annual Parent’s Weekend

 

by David Emrich
‘Staff Reporter
}

 

W&L’s campus is alive with acti-
wity as each fraternity house is being
cleaned, every dorm room straight-
éned, and all the laundry washed in
preparation for the 34th consecutive
Parents Weekend scheduled for this
Vriday, Saturday and Sunday.

. This year, as in the past, W&L’s
-Development Office is coordinating

Director of Development Carter
McNeese, W&L expects 1,500 to
{,700 curious parents, grandparents
and siblings for 1988’s Parents Week-

end.

« McNeese said this year’s schedule
is much the same as past years, but he
did point out several changes and addi-
tions to the calendar.

McNeese said, in the past, the
W&L Department of Music has given
only one concert. Generally it has
been some combination of choral and
woodwind groups. This year,
McNeese said there will be two separ-
ate concerts, The first, on Friday
eVening at 8 p.m. in Lee Chapel, will
headline W&L’s Choral ensembles.
The second, at 8 p.m. Saturday even-
itg in Doremus Gym, will feature the
W&L Wind Ensemble.

He also said the parents luncheon,
usually held indoors, would be held
outdoors this year if the weather per-
mits. The event, called ‘‘The Parents’
Weekend Harvest barbecue,’’ will be
held on the lawn in front of the Presi-
dént’s house from 12:15 to 1:15 p.m.

on Saturday afternoon. If the weather
does not allow the barbecue to be out-
side, it will be held in Evans Dining
Hall.

Professor Edward Hamer has been
involved with Parents’ Weekend since
1956, its second year. He says the
event, which used to be called Par-
ents’ Day, hasn’t changed much in
spirit since its early days.

He said Parents’ Day was a way for
“‘parents, who after all were paying
for their (children’s) education, to
have a chance to meet and get to know
the faculty.’

In keeping with the spirit of the
event, Hamer said, a large part of the
weekend has always been the parent-
faculty conferences. He said the Fri-
day evening concert in Lee Chapel
and the President's report to parents
on Saturday morning, are also hol-
dovers from the early days of Parents’
weekend.

Parents’ Weekend has
however, been without changes.

According to Hamer, in the past
there were lectures for the parents on
Friday evening. He said the dis-
cussions usually centered on some
academic topic such as foreign affairs
or literature.

The discussions, said Hamer, were
soon replaced with Parents’ Seminars.
Under the new system, he said, the
parents are split into about 10 groups
and then matched with a member of
the faculty, an administrator and a
student. The groups then discuss
whatever is of interest to the parents.
Hamer said he thinks parents have

Carriage Company

! Quits: unable to fund operations

 

By Gena Hauser
Staff Reporter

 

+The Lexington Carriage Company
had its last day of operation on Hal-
loween day.

‘Despite a request for $6,000 from
the Lexington City Council, the com-
pany will be unable to fund operations
far the coming year.

“I’ve already made my commit-
ients,”’ said Lexington City Manager
Joseph King.

The city does, however, hope the
bus shuttle will resume operations.
President Ben Nicely said, ‘* I have a
strong feeling the bus will be contin-
uéd, because the city wants more
bysiness for the Virginia Horse
Center.’’

‘The bus could make rounds, bring-
ing people from Lexington to the

horse center ind back

The Lexington Carriage Company
was sold to a group of investors two
years ago.

“It’s a very cut and dry business,”’
said Nicely, who used to drive one of
the carriages daily through the streets
of Lexington.

The tours normally are taken by five
to ten Lexington visitors daily. April,
May and June are dominated by senior
citizens, while June through Labor
Day normally brings families,

“It’s a very demanding job,’ said
Nicely.

Tours used to begin near the Visi-
tors’ Center, then drive on Washing-
ton Street, followed by Main Street.
and then into some residential areas.

The ‘‘clop, clop, clop’* of the hor-
ses will not be heard anymore in the
Streets of Lexington.

 

 

File Phote

found the new system much more in-
teresting and informative.

The switch from lectures to seminar
discussions has not been the only
change in Parents’ weekend over the
years.

‘It used to be,’’ said Hamer, ‘‘that
I and two or three other people would
handle everything.’ He said he and
his team used to arrange lodging and
schedule faculty meeting times for all
the parents.

He said, ‘‘Those were the early,
heroic days’’ of Parents’ Weekend.

Now, of course, planning for Par-
ents’ Weekend is far more decentra-
lized. Parents are responsible for their
own lodging, and students must ar-
range faculty meeting times for their
parents.

According to McNeese, the De-
velopment Office does not so much
plan Parents’ Weekend as coordinate
it.

He said, ‘‘We coordinate what the
various departments do, but the De-
velopment Office does not tell the in-
dividual department to arrange an
event for Parents’ Weekend. Most de-
partments,’” said McNeese. ‘* have
their own special event.’’ He added
that planning wasn’t really necessary
because ‘‘their is a highly cooperative
atmosphere at W&L anyway.”

Some of the most popular events at

McNeese, have been the parent-

In 1984-85, before women arrived

on the W&L campus, the Fraternity
Affairs Subcommittee studied the pos-
sible establishment of sororities. They
recommended to the university that if
interest was shown in sororities, the
University was obliged to show the
same support that it does for fraterni-
ties. They also suggested a committee
be formed when that interest was ex-
pressed to decide when and how the
sororities should be colonized.

In 1986-87 the Women’s Forum
Sorority Committee sponsored an in-
formational session and open forum
on sororities and the alternatives.
After that forum a survey was de-

sororities should not start until more
than 100 women wished to join.

Executive Committee:
Alternative proposals to CRC discussed

 

Stacy L Morrison
Staff Reporter

 

The Executive Committee approved
three proposals Monday night for
alternative formations of the Confi-
dential Review Committee, and will
take these suggestions before the fa-
culty at its next meeting on Monday.

A subcommittee of the EC com-
posed of Dan DuPre, John Fialcowitz,
Alston Parker and John McDonough
wrote the proposals after reviewing
student and faculty opinion. There has
been serious debate concerning the
CRC, and the EC is attempting to find
a committee that the entire student
body can accept.

McDonough said in writing the
alternative proposals, the committee
was ‘“‘shooting more for what the stu-
dent body as a whole would prefer.”’

The primary proposal consists of a
committee composed of two voting
faculty members, two Student Con-
duct Committee members and three
students-at-large. The faculty mem-
bers are to be selected by Washington
and Lee University President John D.
Wilson. The SCC members are to be
nominated by the SCC and selected by
the EC and the students-at-large will
be selected by Wilson and approved
by the EC.

The second and third proposals will
act as options to consider at the faculty
meeting after the initial presentation
of the first proposal, the EC decided
Monday night.

The second alternative committee is
composed of one voting faculty mem-
ber, two non-voting faculty members,

one SCC member and three students-
at-large, while the third alternative
committee is composed of three voting
faculty members, one SCC member
and three students-at-large.

The members of the above commit-
tees will be selected in the same way
the members of the first proposed
committee would be selected.

The EC subcommittee said in their
proposal they would like to change the
ratio of the CRC because of ‘‘the phi-
losophy of the student-run govern-
ment, the need for student input
through elected class officers, the
composition of the student body and
the negative perception by the white
male majority due to the racial/gender
ratio in the current CRC.”’

The CRC is currently composed of
four faculty members and three stu-
dents-at-large. The breakdown of the
committee is four women and two
blacks. Some students have come
forward and said that is a misrepresen-
tation of the white male majority at
this school.

The EC subcommittee also said in
the proposal that their suggestions
‘‘still preserve a maximum level of
confidentiality, the rights of the victim
and perceptions of fairness necessary
for cases to be heard.”’

The EC subcommittee wrote these
alternate proposals with the rights of
the victim and of the accused in the
mind.

In other business, the new policy
that bans posters and flyers from be-
ing hung on the colonnade was ap-
proved, reported Mark Cobb. Build-
ings and Grounds will remove any
flyers that are hung on the colonnade

from now on.

Any posters should be hung on the
bulletin boards on campus, which are
behind Payne Hall, by the Co-Op and
in front of DuPont Hall.

Senior Chuck Shissias made a bud-
get request for the Journal of Science
for $1,000. The EC approved the
budget allocation. The budgets for the
Ski Club and Liberty Hall Volunteers
were frozen at the meeting because the
two groups failed to post announce-
ments about their meetings at the law
school.

University adoptsAIDS policy

by Brooke Jarabek
Staff Reporter

 

The Student Health Committee in

’ the spring of 1988 proposed and adop-

ted a University policy for handling
Acquired Immunodeficiency Syn-
drome (AIDS) cases and education.
This policy is based on the American
College Health Association’s General
Statement on Institutional Response to
AIDS.

Students or employees who test po-
sitive for the antibody to HIV or who
have AIDS ‘‘will not be excluded
from enrollment or employment or re-
stricted in their access to university
facilities or services, unless a medi-
cally based judgment... establishes
that exclusion or restriction is neces-

sary to the welfare of the infected in-
dividual or the welfare of other mem-
bers of the university community’’ as
stated in the draft for the policy pro-
posal.

A person who suspects he might
have AIDS is ‘‘expected’’ to seek
knowledge regarding his possible in-
fection. If he is infected, he should not
behave in a manner that would threa-
ten the health of other university
members. Furthermore, he should no-
tify ‘‘one of the university physicians,
a member of the psychological coun-
seling staff, or a member of the Dean
of Students office, so that the univer-
sity can respond appropriately to their
health and educational needs.’’ This
notification would be ‘‘on a confiden-
tial basis’? according to the policy

proposal.

The university will conduct an ong-
oing educational program to keep uni-
versity members informed of basic
AIDS information and safety guide-
lines.

The director of the Student Health
Committee is to serve as case manager
for individual cases and will help
determine whether a need exists to re-
strict that individual from enrollment
or employment. The policy requires
that ‘‘confidentiality of medical in-
formation will be respected, and dis-
closed to Public Health officials as re-
quired by law.”’

““Testing’’ according to the Health
Committee’s proposal ‘‘is available

Check the
Speed Limit

By Michael Tuggle

 

In the September 15 edition of the Ring-tum Phi,
Police Chief Bruce Beard was quoted as saying ‘*...this town was
out of control.‘‘ Well, call it missing the forest for the trees but
Chief Beard needs to check the ‘‘control‘* and professionalism of
his officers.

Lexington

About a month ago on the Friday night that the freshman pledged
at their various houses, I was in the front yard of my fraternity
house on Washington Street roasting a pig for a Saturday lunch and
noticed a great number of police cars driving up and down Wash-
ington Street. At first, I thought little of all the activity since the
Police Station is on Washington Street, but as the night wore on the
police activity increased and the cars started driving by faster and
faster.

Around 11:30 p.m. a police car turned off of Washington on to
Varner Lane (the road that passes in front of the old Visitor’s
Center) and accelerated down Varner into the first gravel parking
lot on the right.

The car sat in the parking lot for three or four minutes with the
lights on and then suddenly accelerated again, spun around nearly
360 degrees in the gravel and accelerated out of the lot and down
Varner toward Washington Street. The car slowed down at the stop

sign, did a ‘‘rolling stop** and proceeded up Washington toward the
police station.

In a similar instance last spring, there was a domestic disturbance
at the end of Varner Lane and at least three or four police cars came
flying down Varner screeching to a stop at the end of the street.
Once stopped, officers got out of there cars with their pistols
drawn.

About thirty minutes after the cars first answered the call, a
police car sitting in the first parking lot previously mentioned, again
floored the accelerator and spun around, finally exiting the lot. This
time though, the police car came straight across the street and up the
driveway leading to the Pi Kappa Phi and Kappa Sigma parking
lots. The car accelerated quickly up the hill and then back down.

Then this past weekend I was walking on Washington St. toward
home and a police car came flying over the hill by the Centel office
with his blue light on driving well, well over the speed limit and
flew past me near Tucker St.. Once past Kappa Sig the car slowed
down, turned off the blue light and then proceeded up Washington
where the car turned into the residential neighborhood at the end of
the street.

What is going on? Are police officers above the speed limits
whenever they feel like driving a little faster than normal? On the
whole, the police do an adequate job, but the driving is out of hand.
Tear night was a rainy night and there were lots of people walking
up and down Washington Street going to and from various parties.
All it takes is hitting a slick place in the road and someone gets hit.

I realize that in the case of an emergency a policeman is required
to act as quickly as possible, but I have a sneaky suspicion that the
guidelines say something about safety as well. The police zip up and
down Washington Street daily traveling well above the 25-mile-an-
hour posted limit. Something needs to be done before someone gets
hurt. Policeman are employed to enforce the law; not bend it until it
breaks.

The Ring-tum Phi Staff
would like to wish
everyone a

safe
and
enjoyable

A Survival Guide to Parent’s Weekend ~_

 

MY VIEW
By Jon Sbar

 

Once again it is time for students to
test their psychological, intellectual
and physical skills in the most rig-
orous ordeal of the year —Parents’
Weekend. In comparison, final exams
are easy and an honor violation is re-
laxing. In order to continue this ritual
without the students rioting, admin-
istrators make Parents’ Weekend out
to be a fun-fill weekend of family ac-
tivities. Don’t believe this lie for a
second. To put it bluntly, parents’
Weekend is 48 hours of living hell.
The thing that makes the weekend so
tough is that powerful political faction
known as ‘‘mothers.”’

During Parent’s Weekend, mothers
are relentless. Once they discover a
weakness, they will prey upon it until
you break down and admit defeat. The
best thing about the week-end is fath-
ers who are just happy to see you alive
because they know just how incompe-
tent you really are. In order to help
students get through this tough week-
end, I have compiled a list of helpful
hints.

First of all, remember who you are
dealing with. Don’t think of your
mother as the bread-baking, gift giv-
ing person you loved as a child. As
soon as she hits the Lexington border,
your mother becomes a_ trained
professional on a mission to find your
faults and capable of detecting mil-
dewed laundry at a distance of over
1,000 feet.

If it’s possible, keep your mother

out of your room. The best way to do
this is by padlocking the door and
swearing that your room is under
quarantine for a rare case of the bu-
bonic plague. Convince your mother
that the fate of the nation depends on
keeping your door locked. During last
year’s Parents’ Weekend, my mother
spent 27 laborious hours bringing my
room to a near sanitary level. As you
might imagine, she was very unhappy
to discover a group of illegal aliens
living in my closet. If you cannot keep
your mother out of your room, con-
vince her that it was clean until for-
eign agents, searching for classified
documents, ransacked it.

Try to make a good first impres-
sion. The first time you see your par-
ents, it is a good idea to be holding a
book, like the Scholar’s Edition of
Alighieri Dante’s 12-volume poem A

Fly Dies Slowly.”’ Also, maintain ’

good personal hygiene so you can }*

avoid being ridiculed as I was last
year. I was waiting at the airport
when I spotted my parents. They
looked at me and had this conversa-
tion:

Mom: I wonder why that filthy hip-
pie over there is waving at us.

Dad: I think that’s our son. !

Under no circumstances whatsoever
should you let your mother see your
checkbook. Within a matter of seconds
she will spot checks you wrote to
places like The Playboy Video Club.

Check your refrigerator for dead in-

sects and milk with an expiration date _

prior to Sept. 1.
Last of all, don’t lose hope; if Par- .
ents’ Weekend is any later next year it

will be over Thanksgiving Break and ’

you can go home.

Is it political coverage or a biography?

 

MY VIEW
By Courtney Payne

 

Let’s face it... the most exciting
issues arising in the American politi-
cal arena are purely personal. Gary
Hart had his Donna Rice, Teddy Ken-
nedy has his Chappaquidick, and Dan
Quayle had his... where should I
start?

Long after Americans forget Bush’s
slogan, they'll remember that Dan
Quayle’s family (supposedly) maneu-
vered him out of Vietnam. More peo-
ple remember the name ‘Donna

Rice’ than recall Gary Hart’s political
affiliation (Democrat). Is nothing
sacred? Should it be?

Admittedly, most public figures

realize that their personal lives attract
a certain amount of attention. Dan
Quayle should have guessed from the
start that any suspicious ‘‘encounters”’
with females other than his wife are
fair game for the media. Quayle, of
course, is not the only recipient of
close public scrutiny. Just recently,
(false) rumors flew that George Bush
was running around on Barbara. Not
too much before that, we discovered
that Kitty Dukakis had been addicted
to diet pills. We’ve been subjected to
reports on Ronnie’s cancer, Nancy’s
cancer, and even Sandra Day O’Con-
nor’s-cancer. We even know that
Nancy consults an astrologist. Yet,
Jack Kennedy’s ‘‘goings on’’ in the
White House were not common topics
of conversation. It makes you wonder
why the media is so frightfully
thorough in ‘‘covering’’ the private

lives of public figures these days.
Have we decided that they should be
excruciatingly vulnerable to examina-
tion by press and public?

Dan Quayle is a case in point. He
MIGHT be qualified to be an emer-
gency president, but no one really
knows because we’ve all been too
busy looking for other ‘‘wrongdo-
ings’’ to pin on him. Strikes against
his personal life will follow him for-
ever, influencing the rest of his politi-
cal career. It seems that there is a fine
line between what should be known
and what should not. Gary Hart’s dis-
astrous “‘fling’’; with Donna Rice
ruined his career, although that aspect
of his life should not theoretically af-
fect his political performance. The
real issue is whether or not a poli-
tician’s personal morals affect his
leadership abilities. Jack Kennedy is

LETTER

Sigma Society- a burning issue

suspected of having had Mafia ties and

being involved with Marilyn Monroe. °
However, National Inquirer-type stor- ‘

ies were not splashed cross the front
pages for eager readers to snatch up.

No one questioned his credentials be- ,

cause he MIGHT have been cheating
on his wife.

The press cannot take full responsi-
bility for a national preoccupation
with our leaders’ personal lives. Gran-
ted, the issues of Jack Kennedy’s era
were more pressing than the color of
his socks. But we face problems today
that threaten to destroy our society as
we know it. It is time to push oursel-
ves away from reports of Ronnie’s jel-
lybean habit, vote and get to the real
issues at hand. But the way, how

much money did Geraldine Ferraro’s |

husband embezzle?

To the Washington and Lee community:

I would like to bring to your attention that the
Sigma society is again branding students as a part
of their initiation process. I saw two students last
year with significant infections to the brand burns,
and so far have seen one student this year who re-
quired antibiotic therapy. The Sigma society ap-
parently has a longstanding tradition of branding
their initiates with the Greek letter Sigma in the
right groin area, a practice that I find both medi-
cally and morally abhorrent.

While I feel my first responsibility is to treat the
consequences of this practice when students pre-
sent themselves for care in the Student Health
Center, I also feel it is my responsibility to bring
this practice to the attention of the Washington

and Lee community in the hopes that something
can be done to stop it. Branding is a dangerous
hazing practice, no different from those which
have received national attention when students fi-
nally were seriously injured. I feel that the poten-
tial for serious illness or injury is present in this si-
tuation, and that it would not reflect well on
Washington and Lee University if such an inci-
dent did occur.

I feel that peer pressure is what keeps so-called
‘‘traditions*‘ alive at Washington and Lee, and I
hope that increased awareness and open dis-
cussion of dangerous hazing initiation practices
will result in peer pressure that may help end
them. I hope this can happen before ap individual
student is severely injured.

Thank you tor your consideration of this prob-
lem.

Harmful Dogs Trouble Campus

To the Editors:

W&L is a dog-infested campus. Personally, I
love to see puppies and dogs romping through the
quads, playing outside the Co-op and even wan-
dering through Tucker Hall. But recently, my
roommates and I experienced extreme difficulty
trying to leave our apartment to go to dinner. We
were stopped on the second-floor landing by the
sight of two dogs (half wolf, half something else)
gnawing on a live cat.

Needless to say, the sight was not a pretty one.
And dinner certainly could have been more fun.
What made the instance even worse than the sheer

horror of the scene is the fact that the cat probably
was someone’s pet. Since then, I have seen those
dogs attacking puppies and overheard numerous
complaints from other students describing scenes
of a puppy howling from fear as it hides under a
bench trying to escape the dogs, of owners being
nipped at while trying to rescue their puppies from
the dogs, and even of small children being fright-
ened by the dogs chasing them and nipping at
them.

Monday morning, the entire Co-op was disrup-
ted as those two dogs chased another dog into the
building. People parted right and left as the snarl-

 

ing mass ran through the building. About two
hours after this incident, I again saw the dogs
jumping on another dog. One was biting the dog
around the neck.

As I stated before, I like dogs and pets roaming
around campus. It creates a homey, playful at-
mosphere. What I do not like is the possibility that
someone else’s pet could possibly harm or even
kill another's pet or even someone’s child. If you

cannot trust your pet, do not unleash it on
someone else's.

Low Blows on the
Campaign Trail

 

MY VIEW

As far back as spring 1987, ‘an
onymous tipsters’? contacted journa-

_ lists across the national suggesting that

Gary Hart was not the only presi-
‘ential candidate involved in extra-
marital activities. When George Bu-
sha and Michael Dukakis were in Los

; Angeles recently for the second presi-

dential debate, an entire issue of the
‘LA Weekly was devoted to ‘‘the dark
#ide of George Bush.”’

On Wednesday, Oct. 19, the Dow
Jones dropped 43 points in response to
@ rumor that the Washington Post
planned to publish an article linking
the vice president with adulterous ac-
fivities.

Eleanor Randolph points out in her
urticle on Friday, Oct. 21, in the Post
that the market drop created a dilem-
ma in the media because editors ‘‘had
to explain to their readers or viewers
jvhat happened to the market without
spreading unsubstantiated _ political
tumor.’’ The steadfast denials by the
Post and the accurate detailed stories
hbout the rumor appearing in USA To-
day and the Wall Street Journal
suggest the dilemma was handled
properly by the media. However,
Donna Brazile, the Dukakis cam-
paign’s deputy national field director,
bn Thursday. Oct. 20, referred to the
rumor in a way that typifies the 1988
presidential campaign’s negative tone.
, ‘‘I wasn’t on the stock market yes-
terday, but I understood they got a

*uittle concerned that George was going

to the White House with somebody
other than Barbara.’’ Although Bra-

 

zile resigned shortly after this state-
ment was made and Dukakis apolo-
gized and distanced himself from her
remarks, the fact remains that these
totally unwarranted negative words
were spoken. By no means, however,
does the blame for the pessimistic atti-
tude of the campaign rest solely with
the Democrats.

Six weeks ago, the Maryland GOP,
headed by chairman Daniel E. Flem-
ing, sent a letter to its contributors,
which included a picture of Michael
Dukakis alongside convicted mur-
derer and rapist William Horton. Hor-
ton was serving a life sentence for
murder when he raped a Maryland
woman after escaping from a Massa-
chusetts prison furlough program.
The Maryland Republican Commit-
tee’s letter asks, ‘‘Is this your pro-
family team for 1988?’’ Last Sunday,
Republican presidential campaign
chairman James Baker denounced the
Maryland GOP letter much as Duka-
kis denied accountability for Brazile’s
remarks. The condemnations for ac-
tions occurring within the respective
campaigns by their leadership does
not change the overall negative tone of
the presidential race.

The widespread pessimism in the
campaign can only have a negative
effect on the general election. Ameri-
cans are fed up with the low blows
each party has thrown at one another.
The average American voter wanted
substance in the campaign, but
received superficial bickering be-
tween the Republicans and the Demo-
crats. Hence, the public lost interest in
the 1988 presidential campaign. This
will lead to a low voter turnout on
Nov. 8, and a relatively inaccurate re-
flection of who should be the next
President of the United States.

In late July of 1986, Nicaragua
filed suit with the ICJ against Hon-
‘duras and Costa Rica. The Nicaraguan
government asked that the use of it’s
neighbors territories as Contra bases
be prohibited. A little over a year
later, these three nations, plus Guate-
mala and El Salvador, signed a history
¢naking peace plan. Still a year later,
hopes for the success of the plan, Es-
‘quipulas II, are nil, and it’s author,
Oscar Arias Sanchez, the president of
Costa Rica, is described as feeling
“‘alternately discouraged, angry and
powerless.”

Arias’ plan has 10 tenets, all of
‘hich apply equally to each nation.
they are:

1) National Reconciliation: the ini-
tiation of a dialogue between unarmed
opposition forces and their govern-
ments and the release of all political
prisoners.

2) Ceasefire: an undertaking by
tach government to end_ hostilities
within its borders.

‘ 3) Democratization: each govern-

ment was charged to promote, ‘‘an
authentic, democratic, pluralist and
participatory process;’’ including
freedom of the press and the lawful
organization of opposition political
parties.

4) Free Elections: ‘‘free, pluralist
and honest’’ elections were to be held
on all levels and to be monitored by
international observers.

5) Suspension of Military Aid: a
request by each country for aid to in-
surgents to be discontinued.

6) Non-use of Territory to Attack
Other States: all five nations promised
to prevent the use of their territories to
destabilize the region.

7) Negotiations Relating to Secur-
ity, Verification, Control and Arms
Litigation: continued negotiations
monitored by the Contadora Group.

8) Attention to Refugees and the
Displaced: a commitment to give
protection and aid to refugees and to
facilitate their ‘‘repatriation, resettle-
ment and relocation.”’

The plan was doomed to failure at
its signing for two major reasons. The
first being the U.S. distrust of the
Sandinistas. The Reagan administra-

support to the plan because it did not
guarantee that a cessation of U.S.

A petition signed by 93 women dur-

with a simultaneous restoration of pol-
itical freedom in Nicaragua. The sec-
ond reason for Esquipulas II’s failure
was that all its initiatives were vol-
untary, and there were no penalties
nor non-compliance. Therefore, each
country complied with the plan only
when it was convenient to do so.

The plan cannot, however, be writ-
ten off as a total failure. It did begin a
useful dialogue between Central
American countries. More importan-
tly, it recognized their  inter-
dependence in both an economic and
political context.

There were 64 women who responded
they would like to serve on the adviso-
ry committee.

General Volunteers help
the Lexington community

 

By Keri Wessel
Staff Reporter

 

Kline,
phia, PA- **

The General Volunteers is a ser-
vice organization that began last year
under the direction of Mory Watkins
°88. Watkins sought to bridge the gap
between W&L students and the Lex-
ington community by providing vol-
unteers for various social service
groups within Rockbridge County.

Students participating are asked to
commit a minimum of one hour per
week to the program of their choice.
The General Volunteers coordinates
the students and the program. Options
for the students range from tutoring to
physical therapy.

A tutoring program has been started
at Lexington High School and will
eventually include Lylburn Downing
Middle School. Volunteers, including
some pre-med students, currently are
woiking at the Stonewall Jackson

Hospital in a variety of situations.
These include the medical/surgical
ward, obstetrics and physical therapy.
There also are volunteers at both the
Eagles Nest Clubhouse and the Lin-
coln House.

The Eagle’s Nest Clubhouse, lo-
cated in Buena Vista, is a support
system providing daily counseling for
the mentally ill.

The Lincoln House provides a set- :
ting in which mentally retarded adults
learn everyday skills and preliminary
job training. Both facilities help quali-
fied clients find jobs in the commun-
ity.

Students wishing to participate in
any of these programs are required to
sign a contract stating their area of in-
terest and the amount of time they are
willing to commit per week.

Those interested in joining the Gen-
eral Volunteers or getting more in-
formation about a particular program
should contact either Benny Savage or
Keri Wessel.

Athletes question drug testing policy

rights regarding due process of law

by Chris Baradel
Staff Reporter

 

If you were going to write a head-
line for the year in college sports, one
that would have to be considered is
The Year of the Substance Abuser.

The year began with the University
of Miami losing their middle line-
backer for the national championship
game against Oklahoma because of a
failed drug test.

Sports Illustrated recently broke a
story by a former University of South
Carolina football player detailing
steroid use in his life and by his team-
mates. Brian Bosworth’s autobiogra-
phy tells of similar problems at the
University of Oklahoma. Locally,
Virginia Tech wrestler Steele
McGonegal refused, with great pub-
licity, to take the university drug tests.
(He has since agreed to sign a waiver
form.)

Naturally, with drugs affecting so
many athletes in so many sports, the
issue of drug testing has been closely
scrutinized.

Here at W&L, there is no drug test-
ing policy. Athletes must sign a form
at the beginning of each athletic

season stating that they will submit to
testing should they reach an NCAA
championship event. Anyone who re-
fuses to sign is ineligible to practice or
compete. Associate Athletic Director
Dick Miller meets with the athletes
and explains the rules and lists the
groups of banned substances to them
before they sign the form. Miller says,
‘The only place we would be tested is
at an NCAA championship event. It
would be random testing, only known
by the NCAA testing group. For ex-
ample, in tennis last year they tested
the semi-finalists. ’’

According to athletic department
officials, there are three reasons why
athletes aren’t tested by the school.
Miller explained, ‘‘It’s very expen-
sive. We couldn’t afford to test all our
athletes. Secondly, its not the answer.
Education is the only answer.”’

Athletic Director William McHenry
added, ‘‘President Wilson does not
feel that it is appropriate to test all ath-
letes at the Division III level.”’

A fourth reason concerns questions
about the constitutionality of drug test-
ing. McGonegal based his refusal to
take the Virginia Tech test on the fact
that it violated his Fourth Amendment

and probable cause.

Randall P. Bezanson, W&L dean of

law, said a number of court cases in-
volving drug testing are still pending,
so the legality of testing has not been
resolved. He said, **’
testing depends on how reasonable the
form of testing used is in achieving its
purpose.’’ However, he added,
‘Drug testing, if invasive, is a search
and seizure.”

There are between 3,500 and 4,000
banned substances, ranging from
chemicals as well-known as caffeine
and as mysterious as _benzthide.
However, a real problem for athletes
is that many over-the-counter drugs
contain banned substances. For exam-
ple, taking Sudafed could be enough
to be disqualified.

The testing process itself is a com-
plicated one, but basically the ath-
lete’s urine is collected (under superv-
ision) and two vials are filled from the
sample. The vials are labeled, sealed
and secured. The secured container is
shipped to an independent lab, where
one vial is tested. If the first test is po-
sitive, the second vial is also tested,
with the results being final.

To critics who scoff that the tests
can be easily circumvented, McHenry

Three Washington and Lee Univer-
sity trustees ended their terms of ser-
vice during the recent board of
trustees meeting in Lexington.

The trustees who retired are Joseph
S. Keelty of Baltimore, Md., SL Ko-

pald Jr. of Memphis, Tenn., and
Frank G. Young of Fort Worth,
Texas.

A native of Baltimore, Keelty atten-
ded W&L from 1940 to 1942 and
received a bachelor’s degree in 1943
from Loyola College. After serving
three years as an officer in the U.S.
Navy, he joined the family-owned
business James Keelty & Co. in 1946.

He is currently president of the re-
sidential building and land de-
velopment firm which operates in the
Baltimore metropolitan area. Keelty is
a member of the board of trustees of
Loyola College and the board of direc-
tors of Equitable Bancorporation. He
previously served as trustee of Mary-

said, *‘There is no way in the world
that an NCAA sample can be swit-
ched.”’

There has never been an athlete dis-
qualified at W&L, thanks in large part
to the strict adherence and complete
understanding of the rules. McHenry
recalled, ‘‘We told them (student ath-
letes) to report if (they) are taking any-
thing at the time of testing. We had an
individual who informed the doctor at
the time of testing that he was taking
one of the banned substances by doc-
tor’s prescription.”’ Since the doctor
was notified before the test, the athlete
was not declared ineligible when the
sample showed traces of the sub-
stance. According to McHenry, ‘“‘It’s
the athlete’s responsibility to inform
the team trainer.”’

Robert Haley, who was tested dur-
ing last year’s NCAA Division III
tennis tournament, described the ac-
tual testing as ‘‘a tedious process’’ and
‘*kind of a pain.’’ However, he said,
“I really think it’s a pretty good
thing.’’ Haley does have a complaint
against one part of the testing. He
said, ‘‘I know it’s expensive, but I
think (testing) should be done on a
team basis, not an individual basis. I
think that if you test one person, you
should test everyone.”’

Students at W&L interested in
having an animal at school may find it
more difficult to do so in the future.

The SPCA will no longer give ani-
mals out to, students at W&L because
of ‘‘several problems in the past,”
said an SPCA employee.

‘‘The SPCA has had problems with
pets being deserted over Christmas,
parents not wanting their

sons/daughters to have animals, and a
high increase of stray animals.”’

One security officer at W&L said
that a dog was found over Christmas a
few years ago with a sign around its

   

gious organizations in Memphis.

Party debate held in chapel

‘By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

}. The chairmen of Virginia’s two
major political parties returned to
‘their alma mater last night to discuss
jwhat is at stake in next week’s state
and national elections.
’ Donald W. Huffman, the chairman
of the Virginia Republican Party, and
Lawrence H. Framme III, the com-
qmonwealth’s top Democrat, traded
criticism and commentary in a some-
‘times heated exchange in Lee Chapel
at Washington and Lee University, the
school from which both men received
iaw degrees.
, In discussing the race for the U.S.
Senate in Virginia between Republi-
¢an Maurice Dawkins and Democrat
Charles S$. Robb, Huffman said, ‘‘The
Republican candidate is way down’’
and a victory by Dawkins over Robb
would be ‘‘a monumental upset.”’
set.”
; Framme called Robb ‘‘a man of
national acclaim and national stature’’
and said those qualities would be ‘‘a
change for the Senate seat he will oc-
cupy.’’ That seat is now held by Re-
publican Paul S, Trible, Jr.
, Although he predicted defeat for the
GOP in the Virginia Senate race,
Huffman said the commonwealth will
yote Republican in the presidential
election. When Framme discussed
what he thought an administration led
by Democratic nominee Michael S.
_ Dukakis could achieve, Huffman shot

back, ‘‘There won’t be a Dukakis ad-
ministration.’

Huffman said Republican nominee
George Bush ‘‘is as well-qualified
through his experience to be president
of the U.S. as any man in my life-
time,’’ and predicted that Bush ‘‘will
be a good, caring, compassionate
president.”

Framme tried to associate Robb and
Dukakis with the integrity and honor
that he said were guiding principles in
the life of Gen. Robert E. Lee, princi-
ples that he said have been missing
under President Reagan.

“T believe in the bottom of my heart
that the principles of Michael Dukakis
and the principles of Robert E. Lee go
hand-in-hand,” said Framme, and he
said that people who are not dedicated
to those principles ‘‘have no business
being in public life.”’

Huffman admitted that some corrup-
tion has existed in the Reagan admin-
istration, but he said ‘‘There isn’t go-
ing to be an administration that
doesn’t have problénis’’ because
“there are too many temptations’ fac-
ing thousands of federal employees.

The Republican party chief said
Gov. Dukakis’ government in Massa-
chusetts has had to deal with corrup-
tion of its own, but Huffman said he
was sure any Massachusetts em-
ployees who were convicted of crimes
“thave had their sentences commuted

or been paroled,’’ a reference to the

Republican claim that Dukakis has
been soft on criminals.

Framme criticized Bush for what he
called campaigning ‘‘on a negative
basis’’ and said charges that Dukakis
would advocate a weak national de-
fense or foreign policy are not true.

He said polls that give Bush a lead
over Dukakis nationwide show that
“the paid political gurus in their back
room might be more effective than the
paid political gurus in our back
room.””

But Framme didn’t let those polls
keep him from hammering away at the
Reagan adminstration, claiming it
never submitted a balanced budget to
Congress and attempted: to trade arms
for hostages in Iran.

Huffman countered with charges
that a Democratic administration
would be soft on communism.

‘*The Democratic Party has never
seen the threat that has come from the
left,’ he said.

The presentation. was part of
W&L’s Contact lecture series, which
is a joint project of the school’s Inter-
Fraternity Council and the Executive
Committee of the W&L student body.

trustees were elected at the board’s re-
cent fall meeting in Lexington.

The new members are Gray C.
Castle of New Canaan, Conn., H.F.
“*Gerry’’ Lenfest of Huntingdon Val-
ley, Pa., and M. Theodore Van Leer
of Glen Ridge, N.J. The election of
the three trustees brings the number of
WA&L trustees to 30.

A native of Salem, Mass., Castle
received his bachelor’s degree from
W&L in 1953 and his law degree from
W&L in 1955. While a student, Castle
served as secretary to Omicron Delta
Kappa the national leadership

‘**The Americans are coming; the
Americans are coming!”’

That will be the cry of citizens in
four Soviet cities next spring when
W&L sends its first group of students
ever to visit the Soviet Union.

The trip, which is being offered
through the history department and
lead by Assistant History Professor
Richard Bidlack, will include 28 days
in the Soviet Union and four days in
Warsaw, Poland.

Bidlack said the trip is intended to
provide a ‘‘look into contemporary
Soviet society in the context of Soviet
history.’’ Specifically, he said some
of the areas the students will look into
involve Gorbachev’s perestroika revo-
lution in terms of liberalization of the
press, public opinion, contact with
foreigners, and restructuring of the
government.

The proposed cost of the trip is
$2,600, which is dependent on the
number of students who go on the trip
and the strength of the dollar. Bidlack
said 25 students have already expres-

Oil, Xerox and INA. He joined
MONY in 1985 as chief legal counsel
and attained his current position in
1986.

Castle also is a member of the bars
of New York, Virginia, Washington,
D.C., and the U.S. Supreme Court.
He is the founder and first president of
the Westchester-Fairfield Corporate
Counsel Association, and is a member
of the American Corporate Counsel
Association, the Association of Life
Insurance Counsel, and the Interna-
tional Advisory Board of the South-
western Legal Foundation. He is
president of the Rescon Companies —
a real estate partnership firm — and is
director of the Oenoke Condominium
Association.

Lenfest is a native of Jacksonville,
Fla., and received his bachelor’s de-
gree from W&L in 1953 and law de-
gree from Columbia University in
1958. While a student at W&L,
Lenfest was a four-year member of
the soccer team, and was a member of
the Forensic Union and the Sigma Chi
social fraternity.

He served seven years as a lawyer
with Davis Polk & Wardwell in New
York. In 1965, he became associate
counsel for Triangle Publications and
later became editorial director and pu-
blisher of Seventeen magazine.
Lenfest is president of the Lenfest
Group, the nation’s 35th largest cable

sed an interest in going, including stu-
dents who are studying under Visiting
Associate Sociology Professor
Krzysztof Jasiewicz, who is here from
Warsaw.

Bidlack said he would like to have a
final count of students who plan to go
by next week.

Students will receive six credits for
the term. These credits may be taken
all within the history department or
split between history and any other
department with approval from that
department. Bidlack said that he
didn’t think there would be any prere-
quisites, but he strongly recom-
mended that the students have some
knowledge of the Soviet Union, either
through the history, politics or econ-
omics departments, or through a
background in Russian language.

The first two weeks of the term will
be spent doing background reading on
the Soviet Union and practical aspects
of living there, Bidlack said. The stu-
dents will then fly to the Soviet Union
where they will visit Moscow, Leni-
ngrad, Tbilisi and Vilnius.

Bidlack said he chose Moscow since
it’s the capital, Leningrad because he
lived there for almost a year, Tbilisi

ployees. The Lenfest Group operates
cable systems in three California mar-
kets, and in King of Prussia, Lebanon,
Chester and Lancaster, Pa.

Earlier this year, Lenfest and his
wife, Marguerite Lenfest, donated $3

named the Lenfest Center for the Per-
forming Arts.

A native of Mobile, Ala., Van Leer
received his bachelor’s degree from
W&L in 1951. While a student at
W&L, Van Leer was a four-year
member of the cross country team and
was a member of the track team. He
was elected to the Monogram Club in
both his junior and senior years and
was a member of the Spiked Shoe So-
ciety. He was a member of the Phi
Kappa Sigma social fraternity.

Van Leer is president of the Van
Leer Chocolate Corp. He is a member
and former president and secretary of
the Chocolate Manufacturers of the
United States and is a member of the
National Confectioners Association

Van Leer is chairman of the Glen

Bidlack leads trip behind Curtain

because it is in non-European Russia
and Vilnius because it is in the Baltic
states.

‘*The Baltic states are probably the
most interesting area in the Soviet
Union right now because they are try-
ing to exercise a bit more autonomy,”’
Bidlack said. Vilnius, the capital of
Lithuania, has been a kind of testing
ground for the perestroika reforms.
Recently, 300,000 citizens signed a
petition demanding international in-
spection of their nuclear power plants.
Thus, Lithuania and the other Baltic
states may prove to be successes of the
reforms, or they may take their recent
nationalism and try to break from the
Soviet Union, an attempt the Soviet
government would surely try to crush.

The students will then move on to
Warsaw, where Bidlack said they will
have a chance to compare East block
countries. They will spend four days
there before returning to W&L.

These lessons were only the beginning
of a musical career that recently cul-
minated in a concert performance at
America’s Society in New York on
Oct. 24.

‘**New York was the brainstorm of
alumnus Robert Mottley,’’ explained
Vienneau. After reading an article
about Vienneau, Mottley was intri-
gued by Vienneau’s statement that he
liked Lexington audiences better than
New York audiences.

Mottley requested a tape from
Vienneau and decided to test Vien-
neau’s preference. He sent the tape
and letters to various people and or-
ganizations in New York. Vienneau
even has a letter from Jacqueline

B&Bs discussed tonight

by Betsy Griffin
Staff Reporter

 

Tonight there will be a public
hearing concerning a new ordinance
on bed and breakfast establishments.

According to Lexington Building
and Zoning Administrator Don Mette,
the ordinance would allow the City
Council to control the presence of bed
and breakfast inns in the city of Lex-
ington. Currently, there is no ordin-
ance which states the Council’s pol-
icy.

The new ordinance would, accord-
ing to Mette, ‘‘state what the Council
has been doing for years.’’ It would
permit a two-guest bed and breakfast
establishment anywhere in town.
Under the proposed law, if someone
established an inn that accommodated
more than two guests, a hearing be-
fore Council must be held. This way,
Council could impose restrictions
concerning parking and noise control.

Many establishments in Lexington
now offer a room and breakfast, but
are considered tourist homes or down-
town businesses.

One such inn is the Llewellyn

Onassis.

When Lucille Duncan listened to the
tape, she arranged the concert for
Vienneau with the help and sponsor-
ship of the America’s Society, a non-
profit organization that promotes La-
tin American and Canadian art and
also the Canadian Consulate, the New
York Chapter of W&L alumni and the
Quebec Mission.

“It was my first big concert by my-
self in a major city, but,”’ said Vien-
neau, “‘you can’t do it without the
help of a lot of people. Just renting out
a concert hall costs a tremendous
amount of money.”’

The hall was small but filled to
standing room only with approxi-
mately 130 attendees, according to
Vienneau. The concert was given for
the W&L alumni, but was open to the
public. He said, ‘‘The Fiji (his frater-
nity during his undergraduate years at
W&L) representatives from New
York attended the concert and suppor-

Lodge on South Main Street. It offers
a room and breakfast, but was con-
sidered by Council to be a tourist
home. It would not be affected by the
proposed ordinance.

Fassifern Bed and Breakfast is lo-
cated outside of Lexington on Va. 39
near the horse center and would not be
under the proposed ordinance. It con-
tains four rooms in the main house and
two rooms in outbuildings.

There are some establishments in
downtown Lexington which offer both
a room and breakfast, but are re-
gistered as a corporation. These also
would not be directly affected by the
proposed ordinance. The Alexander
Withrow House, the oldest building in
downtown Lexington, and the
McCampbell Inn are two such busi-
nesses. They both are furnished with
antiques and each room has a private
bath. Breakfast is included in the price
of the rooms.

Bed and breakfast establishments
offer an alternative to the major
motels and hotels in Lexington. If the
City Council passes the proposed or-
dinance, the number of bed and break-
fast inns in Lexington may greatly in-
crease.

ted me.”’

Vienneau was asked to come badk
and play for America’s Society again
sometime within the next two years.

Vienneau described the experience
of performing at such a prestigious
event: ‘‘Beforehand, it’s like standing
on the edge of a building and havirig
someone expect you to perform tricks,
You question your senility and won-
der ‘what an I doing here; I can’t real-
ly play the piano’. But then once you
are Out on stage, you tend to block
everything else out and concentrage
only on what you are playing.’

Playing the piano has been a major
part of Vienneau’s life. Under his first
teacher, he entered competitions mt
McGill University for 10- and
11-year-olds at the ages of 5 and 6. He
received a scholarship to study at the
Conservatory of Quebec at age 7.
Most students at the conservatory fehl
in the age range between 14 and 22.

While at Quebec, he studied under
Irving Heller, the head of the consef-
vatory piano department. When Heb-
ler left the conservatory, Vienneau
continued under his private tutelage
from age 12 to 16. y

Heller, who has played at Carnegie
Hall, is the artistic director of the
Montreal International Piano Compg,
titions. He also was a judge at the
Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow,
Vienneau described Heller as “very
intense.”’

“*One day he (Heller) brought me ta
the edge of the window when I was
playing something wrong and said,
“You're going to go down.””’ i

At W&L, Vienneau continued in-
struction under Timothy Gaylaré
throughout his undergraduate years.

“I'd love to be a pianist,”’ said
Vienneau. *‘That’s number one on my «*
list, but unfortunately, there’s the
reality of feeding myself. I don’t fit
the role of a starving artisttype.”” _,

He said he hopes to enter major
competitions after his third year of
law school, but can only do so if he,
finds sponsorship.

A few facts answered for trivia buffs

 

Caly Smith
Staff Reporter

 

A Washington and Lee education
is definitely NOT a trivial pursuit.
Here is a sampling of questions and
answers to test your knowledge of
Washington and Lee:

Q. What job did Gen. Robert E.
Lee turn down to become the presi-
dent of Washington College in 1865?

A. An insurance company offered
Lee its presidency at an annual salary
of $10,000. Lee declined that position
to accept $1,500 a year as the 12th
president of Washington College. The
school’s trustees had to borrow the
money to pay Lee’s salary the first
year.

Q. Who gave Washington and Lee
its first major endowment gift?

A. In 1796, George Washington
made a gift of $50,000 worth of James
River Canal stock to a struggling insti-
tution named Liberty Hall Academy.
At that time, Washington’s was the
largest endowment gift ever made to a
private educational institution in
America. But more importantly to the
Liberty Hall Academy trustees, the
gift saved the school from financial
ruin. To show their gratitude, the
trustees voted in 1798 to change the
school’s name to Washington College.
That original endowment gift has not
disappeared, either; in 1984-85, each
W&L student received about $3.54
from the gift.

Q. What was the first private insti-
tution of higher education to be com-
memorated on a U.S. postage stamp?

A. In 1949 the U.S. Postal Depart-
ment issued a stamp recognizing
Washnigton and Lee’s bicentennial.
The stamp featured renderings of Lee
and Washington superimposed on the
Colonnade. It was a 3-cent stamp —
good for first class mail back then.

Q. When did Washington and Lee’s
football team last play in a post season
bowl game?

A. The 1950 Generals took an 8-2
record to Jacksonville, Fla, on New
Year’s Day 1951 to play Wyoming’s
Cowboys in the Gator Bowl. Had not
an untimely appendectomy felled the
Generals’ star player, Walt Michaels,
the outcome might have been
different. As it was W&L lost 20-7.
Michaels recovered to become an All-
pro with the Cleveland Browns and a
coach in both the National and United
States football leagues.

Q.What national honor fraternity
was founded at Washington and Lee?

A. In 1914 three Washington and
Lee underclassmen organized the first
chapter of Omicron Delta Kappa in
efforts to recognize the outstanding
leadership on the campus. The frater-
nity annually ‘‘taps’’ or initiates stu-
dents who excel in leadership activi-
ties on W&L’s campus and campuses
throughout the nation.

Q. Where did journalism education
begin?

A. In 1869 at the instigation of
Washington College President Robert
E. Lee, the school offered 50 ‘‘press
scholarships’’ and began instruction in
journalism. The project was part of
Lee’s philosophy that the South’s
greatest need following the Civil War
was informed and competent leader-
ship in commerce, law, government,
engineering and public opinion. That
is why Lee introduced into Washing-
ton College’s classical curriculum in-
struction in commerce, law, engineer-
ing and journalism.

Q. Where does the Washington and
Lee student newspaper get its name?

A. When it began publication in
1897, the Ring-tum Phi was named
for an old football cheer, which began
‘*Ring-tum Phi, stickeri bum! We’re
the stuff from Lexington!”’

Q. What were the last words spoken
by Vice President Alben Barkley and
where did he speak those words?

A. Delivering the keynote address
at Washington and Lee’s Mock De-
mocratic Convention on April 30,
1956, Barkley, vice president under
Truman, thundered, ‘‘I would rather
be a servant in the house of the Lord
than to sit in the seats of the mighty.’’
He then clutched his heart and keeled
over from a heart attack. At the urging
of Barkley’s widow, the Convention
continued a week later, nominating
Adlai Stevenson as the candidate of
the Democartic Party — another cor-
rect prediction for the quadrennial
event, which has now predicted 13 of
18 nominees.

Q. What dies the Latin motto ‘‘Non
incautus futuri’’ on the Washington
and Lee coat of arms mean?

A. Not mindful of the future. The
coat of arms was created by quartering
the Lee and Washington family arms
and adding the Lee motto and the
Washington crest (the figure of the
bird at the top). The bird, incidentally,
is araven.

Q. What is the Washington and Lee

A. No doubt you've heard the
Washington and Lee Swing many
times in the past, but you might not

have realized whose song it really is.
The Swing is particularly unusual
among college fight songs since it is
an original product of the college and
is attributed to a trio of W&L gra-
duates. The tune first was strummed
on a mandolin in 1905 by undergra-
duate Mark Sheafe. The melody was
kept alive after Sheafe’s graduation in
1906 and was eventually published
and copyrighted by student Thornton
W. Allen, ‘11. The words were writ-
ten by Clarence Robbins, ‘11. The
familiar tune has been filched by other
schools ever since and is by most
reckonings the most popular football
song ever written.

Q. What college baseball pitcher is
credited with having thrown the first
curve ball in an intercollegiate game
and for whom did he play?

A. On May 20, 1878, Washington
and Lee pitcher George Augustus
Sykes used his curves to stymie the
University of Virginia’s Wahoos in a
game at Charlottesville. The Wahoos
were not at all happy with Sykes’ in-
vention, calling his curve ‘‘a scurvy
trick.”’

Q. Whose statue stands on the Front
Lawn at Washington and Lee?

A. Cyrus Hall McCormick, a native
of nearby Steele’s Tavern and inven-
tor of the reaper, was recognized by
the university for his generous gifts in
the late 1800s.

Q. What was the budget for Wash-
ington and Lee’s first Fancy Dress
Ball?

A. $47. That was the amount that
Miss Annie Jo White, librarian and
drama instructor, had left from a play
she had directed earlier in the 1907-08

academic year. She decided to put the
money into a costume ball, which
years later become known as the pre-
miere social event of the South.

Q. Where did the yearbook, 7he
Calyx, get its name?

A. According to the 1901 edition of
The Calyx, the name was taken from
the calyx of a flower, signifying that
which encloses what is sweetest and
loveliest.

Q. When was the Washington and
Lee campus designated a National
Historic Landmark?

A. In 1971. The citation referred to
the University’s strikingly beautiful
Colonnade as ‘‘architecturally harmo-
nious and spatially related neo-
classical buildings that, together, form
one of the most dignified and beautiful
college campuses in the Nation.’ At
that time only three American colleges
had been honored with the designa-
tion.

The results of the HIV testing will
be kept in a separate HIV file with ac-
cess limited only to the HIV counsel-
ing nurse and university physicians.

While developing this proposal, the
Health Committee discussed the im-
portance of confidentiality. The com-
mittee members selected a statement,
which allowed other university offi-
cials to be informed of AIDS cases on
a need-to-know basis. The committee
determined, according to psychology
professor Nancy Margand, that a
need-to-know situation did not exist.

The Student Health Committee per-
forms other functions ‘in addition to
creation of the AIDS policy. This
year, the committee has been adopted
to study student health service as part
of the long range planning program.

As advisory, educational and pol-

icy-forming committee, it evaluates
the service provided by the student
health clinic, as well as providing ed-
ucational materials and programs
about AIDS, drugs and other impor-
tant issues.

The committee will investigate the
effectiveness of the clinic hours, staff
numbers and members, the adequacy
of facilities, the health education
efforts, gynecological services, per-
sonal counseling services, athletic
medicine, alcohol policy for overnight
visits in the clinic, the provision of
medication at no cost and the design of
a questionnaire for student evaluation
of the health center.

The committee encourages student
input. A student may drop a sugges-
tion in the suggestion box located in
the university health clinic or contact
one of the committee members.

The committee members are Lisa T.

D. Logan 90, Nancy A. Margand,

- Sampson throws Generals to 14-10 win

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

BRIDGEWATER W&L foot-
ball’s defense has been outstanding in
1988, but during the fourth quarter
Saturday, it was the offense that
shined, as the Generals rallied for a
14-10 conference win over the
Bridgewater College Eagles.

Despite a slow start for the offense
— the game was scoreless at halftime,
and the Generals (3-3-1) were shut out

“« through three quarters — junior quar-

terback Phil Sampson turned in the

* best performance of his career, lead-

ing W&L on two fourth-quarter

touchdown drives and completing 19

* of 29 passes for 193 yards, one touch-
down and no interceptions.

But while Sampson led the drives,

senior linebacker Tom Skeen made

“them possible by picking off two

‘-* fourth-quarter passes.

The first interception halted the

1 Eagles’ most impressive drive of the
vi afternoon. Running back Anthony
‘e) Lawrence led Bridgewater on a
53-yard drive that gave the Eagles a

« first down at the W&L 3. Quarterback
ti Matt Puryear threw into the end zone

,.on the next play, and Skeen stepped in
vc front of the receiver for his third

interception of the season and the

, ,, eleventh of his career.

Tuesday afternoon. The Washing-

Sampson brought what had been an
ineffective W&L offense to life. The
Generals put on an 80-yard clinic that
took nearly eight-and-a-half minutes
and 16 plays. The classic ball-
possession drive was impressive and
time consuming, but it was also har-
rowing, in that the Generals faced
third down four times and fourth
down once.

But four clutch plays kept the drive
alive. Facing third and seven at his
team’s 23, Sampson found sophomore
slotback Carl Gilbert for a 14-yard
gain. Three plays later, Sampson hit
sophomore split end Craig Irons for
10 yards on third and nine. And three
plays after that, Sampson scrambled
for seven yards on third and four.

But W&L’s third-down magic
didn’t last. On third and three at the
BC 18, sophomore tailback Mason
Pope was stopped after a 2-yard gain.
W&L needed only a yard on fourth
down, but senior tailback Tony Was-
kiewicz picked up two and gave W&L
a first down at the Bridgewater 18.
Two plays later, Pope scampered in
from 16 yards out, and sophomore
Carter Quayle’s kick put the Generals
up 7-3 with 4:46 left.

An excellent kickoff return put the
Bridgewater offense in excellent field
position at the W&L 47, but Skeen’s
second interception of the day and a
14-yard return made it seem like
W&L had iced the game. Instead,
Pope fumbled two plays into the W&L
drive, and the Eagles were back in
business.

And, to his credit, Puryear didn’t let
his two interceptions get to him. The
Bridgewater quarterback threw for all
of a 62-yard drive in only five plays,
including a 14-yard scoring pass to
running back Mike Redmon that gave
the Eagles the lead. Darrell’s extra
point put Bridgewater up 10-7 with
only 1:26 remaining.

Bridgewater's Homecoming crowd
of 2,750 went apoplectic, and the
Generals easily could have folded.
However, according to Sampson, the
W&L offense was virtually unaffec-
ted. Rather than thinking the game
was over, the Generals decided; We’-
ve already come from behind once to-
day, so let’s do it again.

‘Our confidence on that last drive
was just amazing,’’ said Sampson,
who commanded the W&L_ two-
minute offense on what he called the
Generals’ best drive of the season.

W&L started at its own 33 but
quickly picked up 15 yards on a first-
down pass to Irons. But the offense
stalled at midfield and, after three
straight Sampson incompletions,
WA&L faced fourth and ten.

“‘In the huddle, I didn’t see looks of
despair in the faces of the linemen or
the receivers,’’ said Sampson. Cool
under pressure, sophomore split end
Chris Acebal made the catch of his life
near the sideline at the BC 41 to give
WA&L a first down and keep the drive
alive.

‘That was the crucial one,’’ said
head coach Gary Fallon. ‘‘He drops
that or doesn’t get the first down, and

 

very few opportunities, with junior
Ricky Silva having the only two
legitimate scoring chances. A few
minutes into the game, Silva appeared
to score but the officials ruled the ball
did not go into the goal. The second
chance was with five minutes left in
the half. Silva beat the Hornets’ de-
fense but his shot on goal was just off
to the left.

The Generals then started out strong
in the second half. Junior Scott Levitt
sent a nice cross towards the goal for
freshman David De Falco that was
broken up at the last minute by
Lynchburg goalie Rob Simpson. Silva
then blasted a shot off the goalie that
rebounded out. Sarber misfired on an
open net high and wide right as well
and Silva again was stymied by Simp-
son several minutes later.

The missed opportunities would
come back to haunt the Generals.
After Silva’s chance, Lynchburg
moved the ball upfield and scored on
sophomore goalie Jon Bull to go up
2-0. Lynchburg was able to take every
missed General opportunity and turn it
into a fast-break situation.

With the offense sputtering, things
looked grim for the Generals until five
minutes were left in the game. Urso
broke down the right wing with the
ball and saw Sarber flash open in the
middle. Urso’s pass was on the mark,
and Sarber put the Generals on the
board with a shot past a diving Simp-
son.

‘*We passed the ball well in the first
half, and we were a little unlucky,”
Veliuona said. ‘‘We thought we
scored right at the beginning but the
ref said the ball didn’t go in the net. I
think we slowed up a little on defense
in the second half and we had to play
with our backs up against the wall.”’

The Generals had several more op-

portunities after that, but couldn’t
cash in on them. The 2-1 loss dropped
the Generals to 7-6-2 on the season
with one game remaining. The defeat
also gave the Generals a third-place
finish in the ODAC.

On Saturday, W&L defeated high-
ly-rated Millersville in Pennsylvania
2-1. It was a come-from-behind win in
not the greatest of playing conditions.

‘It was our best effort of the year
against an aggressive and talented
team,”’ said Piranian. ‘‘In the first
half against the wind, it would have
been easy to pack it in due to the con-
ditions. They were being very physi-
cal. We hung tough and showed a lot
of character and composure.

‘It was one of the classic wins since
I’ve been coaching here.”’

‘*We played really well in the sec-
ond half and put two balls in the net,””
said Veliuona. ‘‘I felt that if we kept
them to one goal going with the wind
in the first half, that we could score
two goals and we did. We played 90
minutes of soccer for the first time this
season.”*

Urso scored to tie the game and co-
captain Veliuona scored his second
goal of the season, both game-
winners, to give the Generals a hard
fought victory.

As for the seniors, they will be
surely missed next year. Sarber is the
team’s leading scorer this season with
five goals and two assists. For his ca-
reer he has 20 goals and eight assists.
Veliuona has a knack for game-
winning goals. Urso had two goals
and four assists this year and eight
goals and eight assists in his career.
Both Halpert and co-captain Udicious
have provided excellent defense
throughout the year.

season is Tuesday at VMI.

Three straight first-down passes put
W&L in the end zone. Junior slotback
Scott Jackson hauled in a 23-yarder to

First-year Ursinus head coach
Steve Gilbert will try to do what
none of his predecessors could —
beat W&L in Lexington— when he
brings his team to Wilson Field for
Parents’ Weekend Saturday after-
noon at 1:30.

The Grizzlies are 2-1 against the
Generals after losing last year
21-7. But a new head coach has
brought a new offense, a new de-
fense and new challenges for coach
Gary Fallon’s Generals.

This year’s Ursinus team (2-6,
2-4 in the Centennial Conference)
is built around the passing of soph-
omore quarterback Brian Thomas,
who averages nearly 200 yards per
game. And, despite the Grizzlies’
poor record, Fallon is worried

“They frighten me for this
reason: they live by the pass,”’ said
Fallon. ‘*The people that play them
haven’t been able to keep them off
the scoreboard."’

Thomas (6-1, 190) has been
named the player of the week in the
Centennial Conference twice this
season. He is a 70 percent passer
(155 completions in 220 attempts)
but has thrown more interceptions
(16) than touchdowns (12). His top
receivers are Joe Czechowicz (6-1,
188), with 37 catches for 565 yards
and four touchdowns, and Kevin
Ross (6-2, 185), who has 34 re-
ceptions for 463 yards and seven
TDs.

The Grizzly defensive set uses
four linebackers, four down line-
men and three defensive backs, but

Dominion Athletic Conference
Player-of-the-Week. This week he
has been named The Ring- tum Phi
Athlete-of-the-Month.

Tom Skeen, a 5’10°’, 215-pound
senior from Paris, Kentucky has
been chosen by The Ring-tum Phi
as Athlete-of- the-Month for Oc-
tober. Skeen is one of the starting
linebackers and a tri-captain on the
football team. He also shoulders
the punting chores.

Last week against Bridgewater,
Skeen was in on 19 tackles and
intercepted two passes, one in the
end zone to stop a Bridgewater
drive. His play helped the Generals
to a come-from- behind 14-10 win.
Over the past three games, Skeen
has made an unbelievable 46 tack-
les. He is the team’s leader in al-
most every defensive category. He
is currently second on the all-time
interception list (first for lineback-
ers) and he leads the team with four

By Jay Plotkin “Tom is a laid-back individual
Staff Reporter who doesn’t hoot and holler,’’ said
head football coach Gary Fallon.
Last week he was named the Old *‘He knows his ability and respects

those he is around. He is an out-
standing leader by example.”’

Skeen’s most memorable mo-
ment on the field came as a fresh-
man when he caused turnovers on
consecutive possessions. ‘‘It was
the Hampden-Sydney game, and
we were winning late in the first
half. One of their players came
across the middle and I drilled him
and he fumbled. We turned the ball
over right after that, and they were
driving. Then I fiitercepted a pass
in the end zone to stop that drive.”’

‘‘He is thebest linebacker that
has played for us in my 11 years of
coaching here,’’ said Fallon. ‘‘I
just hope someone can step in and
we won’t miss him, but he will
leave some tough shoes to fill. It’s
like how do you replace a good
running back? I think his level of
play will be an inspiration for those
who will follow him and those who
look up to him.”’

Skeen is also a versatile athlete.
Aside from being the leading tack-

Off the field, Skeen is a business

Trojans are likely opponent
for W&L polo in tournament

 

By Tom Wingfield
Staff Reporter

 

Imagine Sugar Ray Leonard and Marvin Hagler fighting
again here at Washington and Lee. Okay, now substitute
Leonard and Hagler with the University of Arkansas-Little
Rock and Washington and Lee water polo teams. Barring
an unbelievable upset, this will be the matchup in the title
game in the Southern League Championships to be held at
Cy Twombly Pool this weekend.

The tournament will feature W&L, Hampden-Sydney
Richmond and Arkansas. The Generals tangle with Hamp-
den-Sydney at 12:00 in the afternoon on Saturday and play
Richmond at 5:30 that same day. The championship game
is slated for 1:15 p.m. Sunday.

It is hard to picture anyone but the Generals and the Tro-
jans meeting in the finals. These two teams played two
weeks ago in the finals of a tournament in Wilmington,
N.C. and both are the class of the Southern League. Ar-
kansas, ranked 15th in the nation, was victorious in that
matchup as they downed the 18th-ranked Generals 13-8.

But don’t think for a moment that W&L won’t be ready
come Sunday afternoon. Since that earlier defeat, W&L
head coach Page Remillard and his charges have been stu-
dying miles of game tape and been logging extra practice
time in the pool.

‘*The guys have been working very hard,”’ said Remil-
lard, whose team is seeded second, behind the Trojans, in
the Southern League. ‘‘We’ve made some adjustments and
added some wrinkles to our overall game plan.”

But the normally verbose coach would say no more.
Remillard has obviously got a few surprises in store for the
Trojans that he does not want to reveal.

Last year, the two met in a classic confrontation at

Twombly Pool. The Generals, buoyed by a cheering
crowd of around 450 people that reached over 120 decibels
(louder than the Twins’ fans were in the Metrodome dur-
ing last year’s World Series), rallied for a 10-9 victory
over Arkansas-Little Rock.

“The crowd played a large part in our victory last
year,’’ Remillard said. *‘They gave us great support. We
would really benefit from another large crowd this Sun-
day.”’

“It gets you psyched up,”’ said senior co-captain David
Reavy. ‘‘The only time we get to play in front of a large
crowd is at home. It’s a lot more exciting.

“It helps both teams. We just won’t be the only ones af-
fected. It will help us play well as well as help Arkansas-
f Little Rock.’’

The W&L aquatics staff is ready for a big turnout for the
championship match, adding extra seating on the pool
deck.

As far as the future repercussions are concerned, this is
the time of the year when every game becomes more and
more important. With the Eastern Championships rapidly
approaching, the winner of this tournament will most
likely receive a high seed at Easterns. The top two teams
from the Southern League will qualify for next week’s
Eastern Championships.

“*It sets the tone for Easterns,’’ said Reavy. ‘‘We win
this one and we can get things rolling heading into the
Eastern Championships. We might see two teams weaker
than Arkansas in our first two games at Easterns, so it will
give us confidence by winning this one. The higher seed is
also important because it will help us get through the first
round easier.”’

With this on the players’ and coaches’ minds, the teams
head into a tournament in which they are almost destined to
meet in the championship. In the words of Arkansas coach
Richard Turner, ‘*It will be a war!”’

 

 

 

What’s the strategy?

Water polo head coach Page Remillard will try to find a way for

his team to defeat Arkansas-Little Rock.

Cross country teams prepare for conference championship meets

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

The Washington and Lee cross country teams
traveled to Eastern Mennonite last weekend
with more in mind than just running an Old
Dominion Athletic Conference meet. What the
Generals were actually doing was preparing for
Saturday’s conference championships.

W&L will make the same trip this weekend as
the championships will be held at Eastern Men-
nonite. More important, however, will be the
fact that the race will be run on the same course
the Generals just competed on.

‘‘That’s the purpose of running it the week
before,’’ said men’s head coach Dick Miller.
‘*That’s why I scheduled it there. So we could

get a good look at the course and have a compe-,

titive chance on it before we have to run it for
the conference meet. That was our whole pur-

pose.”’

“‘T think for any runner who is less estab-
lished, knowing the course can help,’’ said
women’s head coach Jim Phemister. ‘‘Every
runner is a little more confident and can run that
way. I think it will be a big advantage.”’

In the meet itself, the men’s team, 6-4, lost to
Eastern Mennonite 22-33 but defeated Hamp-
den-Sydney 16-42. Leading the way for the
Generals was senior co-captain Bill Clark, who
finished second in a time of 27:58 on the hilly
five-mile course. Freshmen Charles Edwards
(6th, 28:42) and Lee Parker (7th, 29:27), junior
Joe Geitner (8th, 29:24) and freshman William
Benson (11th, 31:02) were the other scorers for
W&L.

“It’s nice to know the course now,’’ said
Clark, who thought his time was a little slow.
“Tt will definitely help.”’

In the women’s race, the Generals, 4-4, were

competing against the best team in the confer-

ence—Eastern Mennonite. W&L lost:.18-44, but
the surprising thing about the race was not the

score but the performance of sophomore Paige
Cason.

Cason finished eighth in a time of 22:46. But
for the first time when she has run for W&L,
Cason was not the Generals’ top finisher. That
honor belonged to sophomore Cecily Tynan,
who took third place with a time of 21:12 over
the 3. 1-mile course.

‘*Everyone is entitled to a bad race,’’ said
Phemister of Cason’s time. ‘‘She had a particu-
larly tough two or three weeks[academically]
and she responded as expected of someone who
has not been well rested.

“‘Overall, it may have been a good experience
for her because that was the first time a race was
physically difficult for her and yet she worked
through it. It also helped Cecily Tynan, because
that was the first time she has had to lead a
race.’’

Sophomore Heather Jenkins (10th, 23.25),
and seniors Copeland Kapp (11th, 23.56) and
Stephanie Smith (12th, 24.22) were the other

,

three scorers for the Generals.

As for W&L’s chances in the conference
championships, both coaches think that the
Generals will probably finish in third place.

‘‘Eastern Mennonite and Lynchburg are real-
ly running for first and second, and I think
everybody else is running for third,’ said Mil-
ler of the men’s field. ‘‘{Clark] has as good a
chance as anyone of winning it all.”’

In the women’s field, Phemister sees Eastern
Mennonite and Lynchburg as the top two teams
as well, but will not be disappointed with his
team’s effort if it should happen to end up in
third.

“We're not only getting better every year,
but also getting proportionately better to the
other teams,”’ he said. ‘*We are closing the gap
on the other teams,”’

Cason is the defending ODAC champion and
was named the conference Runner-of-the-Year
last season.

Volleyball
sets itself
for ODACs

by Beckwith Archer
Staff Reporter

 

 

The W&L women’s volleyball team
has finished up regular season play.
Last Thursday night the team split
with Bridgewater and Bluefield at
home. Bridgewater, ranked number
one in the region, defeated the Gen-
erals decisively, but the team rallied to
beat Bluefield in two straight games.
Saturday afternoon the Generals went
on the road and lost to Guilford in
three straight.

The women are now preparing for
the ODAC Championships to be held
at Emory and Henry on Nov. 4-5.
Only the top eight of the 10 ODAC
teams are invited to the tournament,
and the Generals earned a berth by fin-
ishing up fifth in conference play. The
team’s overall record was 15-9 and
4-5 in conference.

The Generals are in the
bracket with Bridgewater, Emory and
Henry and Mary Baldwin. All three
are teams that have posted wins over
the Generals during regular season.

After the tournament, the team will
graduate its first seniors. Head Coach
Susan Dittman on the seniors:

Melissa Thrasher: ‘‘Melissa has
been with the program all three years.
She was the key to getting women’s
volleyball started at W&L.”’

Vanessa Hartman: ‘‘Vanessa has
played all three years and is the
hardest worker on the team. She did
not play varsity in high school, and
has come a long way.”’

Amy Smith: ‘‘Amy has been with
the team for two years. Before ‘that,
she had never played volleyball: She
is definitely the most improved player
on the team.”’

Jessica Reynolds: ‘‘Jessica’ has
played all three years. She turned in
impressive games against Hollins and
Emory and Henry. Though she does
not always see a lot of action, she has
a lot of spirit and is willing to do
whatever is necessary to help: the
team.” :

Steve Baldridge: ‘‘Steve has been
invaluable as a student coach. He‘was
instrumental in getting the women’s
volleyball program started. ’’

Parents are taken for granted.

For the fourth year in a row now, my parents are com-
ing down from Pennsylvania for Parent’s Weekend.
They will read this column, as they have read every other
column and sports story I have ever written. They will
also read everything I write in the future.

Parents are a strange phenomenon. This weekend I'll
look into the crowd at the football game and see the par-
ents of almost every player, watching their son. It doesn’t
matter if their kid gets in or not, they'll sit on those un-
comfortable benches and watch. And be proud.

Think of all the times your parents came to see you
play in one of your games. My parents went to every
single home basketball game (and even some on the road)
when I was in high school, even though my chances of
seeing any playing time were worse than winning the
Virginia lottery. They didn’t care if I played or not.
Neither did any of the other parents.

It’s amazing how much influence parents can have on
the athletic growth or development of a person. There are
the parents who are coaches, making their kids practice
for hours on end before the child is even old enough to
know what the words commitment and sacrifice mean.
There are the parents who are teachers, giving little poin-
ters here and there in an attempt to help you be a better
player. And then, regrettably, there are the parents who
are uncaring, distancing themselves from their child’s
endeavors. It seems ironic that some of the best athletes
come from broken homes. Even a negative influence can
have a positive outcome.

When you are out there—wrapped up in the competi-
tion—our parents aren’t noticeable, just one of the
several specks in a sea of faceless individuals. But when
its over, there they are, ready to congratulate or console
depending upon the result of the game. Again, it doesn’t
matter how you played or if you played or even if your
team won or lost. What matters is that you were a part of

 

Se. eee
Mom and Dad really

make a difference

 

the team that played.

Unconditional love is a strange, illogical thing. People
talk about ‘‘earning’’ respect from another person or
‘deserving’ a reward for some completed task. Uncon-
ditional love is not earned or deserved but rather given.
No one demands it and no one works for it. Your parents
just give it to you, no questions asked.

Do me a favor if your parents come down to see you
this weekend. Let them know how grateful you are for all
the times they have been there for you—and only
you—when you needed them. Believe it or not, they have
done more for you than you can possibly imagine.

It’s funny how our attitudes change when we get to col-
lege and spend a few years away from home. Before, you
hoped your parents wouldn’t embarrass you in front of
your friends or would be ‘‘like other parents’’ and give
you a | a.m. curfew. Now, I look at my parents and
think, ‘They sure are cool.’’ I guess that’s what you call
growing up.

NOTES—I don’t know if this is necessary, but support
W&L water polo on Sunday in its match against Arkan-
sas- Little Rock. The crowd made a difference last year
and it’s so nice to see a little school enthusiasm for an ath-
letic event... Congratulations to Jan Hathorn for winning
ODAC Coach-of-the- Year. She has brought the
women’s soccer program a long way in just two years of
varsity competition and the outlook for next season is just
as bright... Is Larry Brown scum or what? First he ad-
mits he knew Kansas committed NCAA recruiting viola-
tions but didn’t think them major enough to report them.
Then he has the audacity to say he would have stayed at
Kansas (he’s now the coach of the San Antonio Spurs) if
he had known that the NCAA was going to levy such a
harsh penalty. Don’t call us, Larry, we'll call you when
we want you to give a lecture on integrity...

“Animal House’’is your choice for No.1

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

I must say, this has been a real ex-

perience. It has been a great deal of

fun seeing what films you thing are the

best ever. Not surprisingly, none of

my top ten made your top ten but E.T.
did make the top 15.

Your top ten is made up of great
movies from top to bottom. In fact,
the top ten films you chose have won
24 Academy Awards between them.
Five are comedies, three are ac-
tion/adventure and two are dramas.
Each film has some aspect of excel-

lence and all are worthwhile viewing

experiences. Though your picks for
25 to 15 are not quite as wonderful, I
_Suppose each of them has some merit
as well (although in a couple I’m not
«so sure.)

So now, without further ado, here
Washington and Lee are your top 25

favorite films of all-time. And thank
you for your support.

“it

#25. Angel Heart (1987, Dir. Alan
Parker)

Interesting plot-twisting film starring
.Mickey Rourke, Robert DeNiro and
Lisa Bonet in her first and most con-
troversial film role. Rourke plays two-
bit private eye hired by DeNiro to find
a missing man that Rourke eventually
wishes he had never found. Frighten-
ine images and intriguing plot turns.

FA very good watch.

P24. The Wizard of Oz (1939, Dir.
- Victor Fleming)

Classic American film about Kansas
farmgirl (Judy Garland) who goes
over the rainbow into the land of Oz
where she meets the scarecrow (Ray
Bolger) the tin man (Jack Haley), the
cowardly lion (Bert Lahr) and the
Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret
Hamilton). A must see for any serious
film buff or any true film lover.

23. The Terminator (1984, Dir. James
Cameron)
First and best of the Schwarzeneggar
films about a cyborg sent back in time
to kill the hope for the future. Intel-
igent script and relentless drama
nake this film a delight to watch. Just
s good the second and third times as

  

 

it is the first.

22. Top Gun (1986, Dir. Tony Scott)
The most expensive navy recruitment
film in history. Great flight sequences
and adequate storyline. Tom Cruise,
Anthony Edwards, Meg Ryan and Ke-
lly McGillis all give fine performan-
ces. Fun film to watch but a real buzz
crush for all those people who saw it
and signed up to fly jets and who are
now scraping barnacles off battleships
in the Persian Gulf.

21. Stripes (1981, Dir. Ivan Reitman)
Hilarious Bill Murray yarn about an
army unit out of control. Murray is a
scream as usual as are Harold Ramis
and John Larroquette. Good early per-
formances by Judge Reinhold and
John Candy as well. Very fun film to
watch.

20. The Natural (1984, Dir. Barry
Levinson)

Definitely one of the most cliche films
ever made but a beautiful film to
watch. Acted superbly by Robert Red-
ford, Glenn Close, Kim Basinger,
Wilford Brimley, Robert Duvall, Bar-
bara Hershey and the rest of this all-
star cast. One of those films that
makes you stand up and cheer even
though you know what’s going to
happen.

19. Brazil (1985, Dir. Terry Gilliam)
Demented black comedy about a bleak
futuristic society. Directed by Monty
Python alum Gilliam which shows.
Very imaginative and complex but de-
finitely worth watching.

18. The Big Chill (1983, Dir.
Lawrence Kasdan)

Wonderful introspective look at a
group of old college friends who reun-
ite for one of their collegemates fu-
neral, An all-star cast including Tom
Berenger, Glenn Close, William Hurt
and Kevin Kline is superb as is the
60's soundtrack that accompanies the
script. Much like a St. Elmo’s Fire on
an adult level, but better.

17. It’s a Wonderful Life (1946, Dir.
Frank Capra)

One of American filmes real treasures
made by one of America’s finest di-
rectors with one of America’s finest

actors in the lead. Jimmy Stewart is
superb as is Henry Travers as Clar-
ence. This is as much a Christmas
classic as Miracle on 34th St.,A
Christmas Carol or the Grinch.

16. Dr. Penetration (Who knows, who
cares)

Hopefully a poor sequel to Ian Flem-
ming’s Dr. No, Richard Fleischer’s
Doctor Dolittle or Stanley Kubrick's
Dr. Strangelove, but I doubt it. Sorry.
Haven't seen it.

15. Deep Throat (same clown as 116
probably)

The first of the widespread films fea-
turing carnal artistry as its subject
matter. Virtually quite a simplistic
film whose plot summary unfolds in
the first, say, 30 seconds. With this ti-
tle, film should have been about a
sword swallower. It would probably
have been more exciting and far more
interesting intellectually.

14. E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982,
Steven Spielberg)

My pick for number one without ques-
tion. Enchanting film about the love
between a young boy (Henry Thomas)
and an orphaned alien who he be-
friends. Touching film that really tugs
on the old heartstrings no matter how
many times you have seen it. Already
the number one grossing film of all-
time.

13. One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest
(1975, Dir. Milos Forman)

Fantastic film about the triumph of the
human spirit starring Jack Nicholson
and Louise Fletcher who both won
Oscars for their performances. Film
also won Best Picture, Screenplay and
Director designating it as one of the
few films in history to ever win all
five top awards at the Academy
Awards.

12. Debbie Does Dallas (19??, Dir.
I.M. Demented)

Terribly boring film about the statisti-
cian for the Dallas Cowboys football
team, and for the Dallas police de-
partment and other various estab-
lishments around the Dallas area.

11. Casablanca (1942, Dir. Michael
Curtiz)

No question one of the finest motion
pictures ever made. Humphrey Bogart
and Ingrid Bergman and incredible as
is the film as a whole. One of those
films you watch and can’t believe just
how good it really is. Full of wonder-
fully rememberable lines and an un-
forgettable performance by Dooley
Wilson singing ‘‘As Time Goes By.”’

10.Rocky (1976, Dir. John G. Avild-
sen)

Wonderfully inspirational film about a
down and out boxer who gets a shot at
the heavyweight championship of the
world. All around fine performances
by everyone in the all-star cast. Be-
lieve it or not Stallone got an Oscar
nomination as Best Actor. Too bad he
plays every part like Rocky or he
might get another one. Bill Conti's
music and theme especially remain
some of the most popular and inspir-
ing film music in history.

9. Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981, Dir.
Steven Spielberg)

Non-stop action/adventure film star-
ring Harrison Ford that took America
by storm. Visual effects justifiably
won an Academy Award but Speil-
berg was again snubbed as the direct-
ing award went to Warren Beatty for
Reds. To this day, there may not be
another film to top Raiders enthusiasm
or energy in effects.

8. The Blues Brothers (1980, Dir.
John Landis)

Outlandish, hilarious comedy about
Jake and Elwood Blues (John Belushi
and Dan Ackroyd) and the Blues
Brother band they assemble to raise
money for the mortgage on the or-
phanage they were raised in. Belushi
and Ackroyd are priceless in their
finest roles as is the plethora of musi-
cal legends they run into along the
way such as James Brown, John Lee
Hooker, Aretha Franklin, Cab Cal-
loway and Ray Charles. A must see to
anyone who loves to laugh.

7. Apocaylpse Now (1979, Dir. Fran-
cis Coppola)

Coppola’s controversial VietNam epic
heavily based on Joseph Conrad’s
Heart of Darkness. Marlon Brando,
Robert Duvall and Martin Sheen all
give fine performances. Film contains

SERVIC,

What do Bill Holmes,

many memorable and disturbing
scenes, but a must see.

6. Gone With the Wind (1939, Dir.
Victor Fleming)

Fleming had quite a year directing this
and The Wizard of Oz. Considered by
many to be the greatest film of all-time
and by all means the finest war epic,
and southern epic of all- time. Clark
Gable and Vivien Leigh and just won-
derful in the leads. She won the Best
Actress award while Hattie McDaniel
won the Best Supporting Actress
award. Masterful storytelling and a
phenomenal, almost flawless film.

5. Star Wars (1977, Dir.
Lucas)

The film that almost single-handedly
caused the explosion in film making
about space. Though nuked by Annie
Hall for Best Picture at the Oscars, it
was by far the most popular film of the
year and maybe the decade. Spawned
two sequels that were better than the
original. The trilogy on the whole is
masterful and a real film treasure.

George

4. Caddyshack (1980, Dir. Harold
Ramis)

Hilarious look at a country club and an
eccentric (Rodney Dangerfield) who
invades it. Film is quite funny overall
with Dangerfield, Chevy Chase and
Ted Knight in the two leads but Bill
Murray steals the film as the greens-
keeper. Film appears a little old now
but will still put you in stitches.

3. Monty Python and the Holy Grail
(1974, Dir. Terry Gilliam)

Cult classic that is very typically
Monty Python humor. Scene after
scene is priceless, however and will
keep you rolling if you are in the
mood to see the film. Much more fun
to watch with a group of people than
alone. A definite film to see for those
enjoying dry, black comedy and those
enjoying Monty Python especially.

 

2. Fletch (1985, Dir. Michael Ritchie)
This may be Chevy Chase's finest
film role as an undercover reporter.
Though it doesn’t necessarily need to
be carried, Chase carries this film off
maximizing its full comedic potential
while not going overboard. A lot of
fun to say the least.

1. Animal House (1978, Dir. John
Landis)

Quite appropriately your number one
pick of all-time considering it is hands
down ‘‘the’’ college film of all-time.
Probably Belushi’s greatest single per-
formance. You can watch this film 20
times (as I'm sure many of you have)
and you'll still find it as funny as the
last time you saw it. Scene after scene
is absolutely perfect. If you haven't
seen it since coming to college, see it
again. You'll have a whole new ap-
preciation for it.

Well, there you go. Your top 25
favorite films of all-time. I hope you
have enjoyed this little poll and thank
you to all the people who participate.
Have a happy and safe weekend with
your parents.

Beethoven and Jane

releaseimpressive LPs

 

By Pat Heffernan and Mike Graf
Staff Reporter

 

Our Beloved Revolutionary Sweeth-
eart( Virgin) is the long awaited follow
up to Camper van Beethoven’sTele-
phone Free Landslide Victory his is a
coming of age album for the Califor-
nia quintet

Our Beloved \acks the outright silli-
ness of its predecessor, but it is still
marked by creative genius. The band
keeps its folk rock sound while adding
more studio polish and maturity. This
change is most evident on the album’s
fourth cut, ‘She Divines Water.”
Jonathan Segel’s wailing violin and
Greg Lisher’s crafted guitar chords
are intertwined with tape splices and
dubs. The end result is a powerful
combination of creativity and crafts-
manship. The song climaxes in a cres-
cendo of studio effects only to close
with an acoustic solo.

Other tracks do not rely on as much
technical assistance but do continue to
reflect the band’s new found maturity.
The record starts with ‘‘Eye of Fatima
(Pts. 1 & 2),’’ arguably its best song.
In Part 1, Victor Krummenacher's
bass riffs lead the way into an ethereal
world of insight via hotel room art.
Par 2 hints at the Campers’ punk past
as driving guitars re-interpret the ori-
ginal melody.

Other highlights include ‘‘O
Death’? with its funeral march beat,
the raucous folk stomp of ‘“Turquoise
Jewelry,”’ the guitar-rich instrumental
‘*Waka,”’ and the plaintive vocals and
simple melody of ‘‘Life is Grand.”
Our Beloved Revolutionary Sweeth-

eart finds Camper van Beethoven ex-
ploring new territory, away from the
joke rock of the past. The final pro-
duct is no different, though an out-
standing album from one of the most
exciting and innovative bands on the
progressive music scene today.

Jane’s Addiction is a band that has
realized where progressive rock is
moving and has taken the
lead.Nothing’s Shocking (Warner
Bros.) is currently number three on
most college rock charts and number
one in the southern region for college
radio airplay. The strength of the
album lies in its recognizable com-
ponents and its unmistakable origina-
lity. The album has a diversity of
sound within each song, but is held
together by an overall mood. The
songs vary form the straightforward
rock of ‘‘Had a Dad”’ to the frenetic
horns of ‘‘Idiots Rule.’’ Tracks like
‘*Mountain Song’” immediately recall
the Cult with their mystic and disjoin-
ted lyrics and the sporadic and omni-
present snare drum.

Bluesy songs like ‘Ted, Just Admit
It’’ reflect their roots and the popular
‘‘Jane Says’’ has a back porch acous-
tic guitar sound that recalls the best of
progressive and classic rock. *‘Ocean
Size’’ reveals the depth of Jane’s Ad-
diction. The slow acoustic intro, the
screaming and then surprisingly me-
lodic vocals, the properly placed
guitar fill, and the snare (again,shades
of the Cult) epitomize the album.

Nothing's Shocking is an album that
demands an audience. This is the fore-
front of the next progression in pro-
gressive music.

The long and winding political road
has reached its final destination with
George Bush continuing the Republi-
can legacy.

Vice President Bush, the expected
winner, took an early lead in the vot-
ing Tuesday and by 9 p.m. Eastern
Standard Time had been declared the
winner by the nation’s media.

According to the Associated Press,
Bush received 54 percent of the popu-
lar vote while Dukakis received 46
percent with 99 percent of the nation’s
precincts reporting.

More importantly however, Bush
rolled over Dukakis in the electoral

college; 40 states with 426 electoral
votes to 10 states with 112 electoral
votes. A candidate is declared the
winner after receiving 270 of the 538
electoral votes.

In Virginia, Bush collected 60 per
cent of the vote (1.3 million votes) to
Dukakis’ 40 percent (850,000). Bush
won all 12 precincts with his widest
margins of victory coming in the more
affluent precincts.

In an article by the Associated
Press, Bush revelled in his smashing
victory saying that his feelings ran
‘‘somewhere between total exhil-
aration and recognition that the chal-
lenge ahead is going to be awesome.””
Bush added ‘‘that his election was a
clear verdict and said he would work

Thefts from students’
cars are a problem

Two students were robbed of more
than $1000 after their cars were
broken into on Oct. 29th while both
cars were parked along Henry Street,
a Lexington police report said.

Burgess A. Thomasson, 22, of Mo-
bile, Ala., was robbed of $295 worth
of stereo equipment after someone
broke into his Ford Bronco II, the re-
port said. A Sherwood equalizer and
amplifier and a Sony portable radio
were stolen, the report said. Thomas-
son told police the crime occurred be-
tween 10:30 p.m. Saturday and 9:15

a.m. Sunday while the car was parked
at 110 E. Henry St.

Keyser Harris, 21, a student at Hol-
lins College, was robbed of an esti-
mated $775 worth of merchandise
after someone broke into her Isuzu
Trooper, the report said. Similar to
the break-in of Thomasson’s Bronco
II, someone broke the right vent
window of the Trooper and stole two
gold rings valued at $700 and a Kodak
35mm camera, the report said. Harris
told the police the crime happened be-
tween 11:30 p.m. Saturday and 9:00
a.m. Sunday while the car was parked
at 8 Henry St.

An auction of departmental office
furnishings, sponsored by University
Services, will take place this Saturday
at 10 a.m. in the student activities pa-
vilion.

Fontanne Bostic, who works for
University Services, said the doors
will open at 9 a.m. so buyers can look
over the selection of office furniture,

antiques, motor vehicles and other de-
partmental relics which are considered
obsolete now for university purposes.
At 10 a.m., Charlie Conner, the mail
room supervisor, will begin the auc-
tion.

Bostic said each item will be tagged
according to the department from
which it came so that the money ear-
ned from its sale can be given back to
that department. Bostic also said there
will be no selling of personal items
and no advanced sales.

Now that the long journey is over,
many in the U.S. are wondering if
Bush’s campaign promises will re-
main intact. In a news conference
Wednesday afternoon, Bush attemp-
ted to shed some light on his future
presidential plans, On taxes, he re-
iterated that his anti-tax stand will
hold saying, ‘‘I’m talking about hold-
ing the line on taxes and I don’t plan to
deviate and I think the American peo-
ple must have understood that.””

In the realm of judicial appoint-
ments, Bush said that ‘‘he has no lit-
mus test for the Supreme Court or
other judicial appointments he will

said that he didn’t want to name
anyone to the court who would legis-

that Bush will have the opportunity to
appoint at least two Supreme Court
justices in the next four years.

At Wednesday's news conference
Bush also appointed james A. Baker
III to be secretary of state during his
administration and chief of staff Craig
Fuller and senior campaign advisor
Bob Teeter as co-directors of Bush’s
transition into office.

Bush is expected back in Washing-
ton early today in order to consult
with President Reagan on the first
steps of his presidency.

It's a funny thing the way the
seasons change so quickly. It seems
like most of the leaves fall in single
night. I never notice the change until
they are all gone and only the empty
branches are left. At that point, the li-
brary gets a little noisier as people be-
gin the final grind to make up for all
those afternoons outside.

But wait a minute, don’t despair -
you don’t have to go to the library yet.
Hunting season is here, and
Rockbridge County is home to some
of the finest hunting in this part of the
country.

The George Washington National
Forest runs right through the county,
offering more than a million acres of
prime hunting land. There are also
thousands of acres of private land in
the area to hunt on - just be sure to ask
first.

The season opened for turkey, ruf-

fed grouse, rabbit and squirrel on
November 7 and will remain open un-
til January. Deer season opens
November 21 and closes December 3
in this county, which only leaves one
week after Thanksgiving break for
those of us who are leaving. Hunters
are allowed two deer this season,
which must be antlered bucks, except
for the last two days when either sex
may be hunted.

Now, it’s not like Alabama or Texas
around here; you can not pick and
choose, but with good scouting,
patience, and a touch of luck, you can
still be successful. There is also hunt-
ing for raccoon, opossum, fox, bob-
cat, and even bear!

Deer hunting is the pursuit that
brings the most hunters to the woods.
Unfortunately, this popularity on oc-
casion creates a dangerous situation
when there are too many hunters too
close together. Each year hunters are
accidentally shot when this happens.
Consequently, the Virginia Depart-
ment of Game and Inland Fisheries

 

has created two laws to increase
safety: mandatory hunter safety edu-
cation and mandatory blaze orange
during firearm deer season.

The hunter safety requirement is for
young hunters and for those who have
never been issued a hunting license to
help ensure that everyone in the
woods knows the safe and responsible
use of his firearm. The last hunter
safety classes of the season are being
offered at the Airport Holiday Inn in
Roanoke on Nov. 12- 13. Call the
Game Dept. at (703)983-7704 for de-
tails.

The second safety rule requires that
hunters wear blaze orange visible
from 360 degrees during deer season,
so that you won’t get your buddy
mixed up with a deer or some other
critter coming down the trail.

Hunter McCoy at the Shootist (now
McCoy’s Sports Center), suggested
the Goshen of the Little North Moun-
tain Wildlife Management Areas near
Goshen as a good area to hunt, but

there are many others as well. The
Pedlar Ranger Station in Buena Vista
has an excellent map of the area for
$1, as well as more detailed topogra-
phic maps of $2.50. Both McCoy and
the rangers are extremely helpful and
would be happy to answer any further
questions.

I have hunted all my life and found
it to be a very rewarding pastime,
having gained a great appreciation for
the animals and the wild places in the
world. I realize, however, that hunt-
ing is not for everyone. I can re-
member countless times when I have
sat at the bottom of a tree, shivering

for hours in the morning frost with
numb fingers and toes, or when my
dog had run off to chase some rabbit
and I had to crawl in the snow through

the thickest tangle of briars imagina-
ble to retrieve my own bird and I had
thoughts of a warm room somewhere.
I guess that sometimes I have wished
for a moment that I had gone to the li-
brary. But only for a moment.

The Executive Committee voted
Monday night to require that all tran-
scripts of closed honor trials be retur-
ned to the EC after the student body
hearing is completed so the EC may
destoy the transcripts.

Transcripts of a closed honor trial
are given to the accused, his advo-
cates, the EC and the President of the
Student Bar Association, who acts as
chair for a student body hearing, if the
accused decides to have a student
body hearing.

EC President Christopher de-
Movellan said the EC decided to re-
vise the White Book "because there
was nothing that said those transcripts
had to be turned back."

Third-Year Law EC Rep. Dave
Nave drafted three revisions which
can go into effect only after a secon-
dary EC vote next week, which is re-
quired to approve changes in the
White Book. s

In the White Book, Part III "Proce-
dure for Honor System Hearings by
the Executive Committee of the Stu-
dent Body," section A, sub-section
two (page six) will now read: "Fina-
lly, the accused will be reminded that
he or she does not have to testify in
either this hearing or a subsequent
Student Body Hearing. The accused
shall also be told that the testimony
given during the course of the hear-
ing, including that of the accused,
shall be recorded.

If the Executive Comrmrittee finds
that the accused has violated the
Honor System and he or she subse-
quently requests a Student Body
Hearing, then the accused, his or her
advocates, the EC, and the Chair may
have this recording transcribed solely
for use at that hearing. The accused,
his or her advocates, the EC advo-
cates, and the Chair shall turn over
any and all transcripts derived from
this recording to the EC immediately
following the hearing. The EC will
then destroy these transcripts."

Under the "Procedure for a Student
Body Hearing," Part IV (page 15), a
section K will be added to read: "Im-
mediately following the hearing, the
accused, his or her advocates, the EC
advocates, and the Chair shall turn
over any and all transcripts derived
from the recording made at the Exe-
cutive Committee Hearing to the EC.
The EC will then destroy these tran-
scripts."

A third revision that does not deal
directly with transcripts will be put
into effect at the same time. In the
third sentence of section O, which
stipulates confidentiality guidelines,
under Part III "Procedure for Honor
System Hearings by the Executive

Staff Report

 

Lexington City Council will decide
this fall whether or not to place a per-
sonal property tax on W&L and VMI
student vehicles.

The tax would affect students living
in the city. A student paying a per-
sonal property tax at home would have
to pay the difference between his
home tax and Lexington’s tax.

Lexington’s personal property tax is

5.5%. If, for example, a student pays
a 4% personal property tax at home,
he would have to pay the 1.5%
difference to Lexington. If the stu-
dent’s home town does not charge a
personal property tax, the student
would have to pay Lexington’s full
property tax assessment.

At Lexington’s ‘‘Town, Gown and
Coatee’’ meeting this past Tuesday,
City Council members discussed the
problem that students are not sharing

Committee of the Student Body," the
word "will" is to be changed to
"may." Therefore, section O will now
read: "For example, the accused, any
student interviewed in an_ in-
vestigation, or any witness in an Exe-
cutive Committee Hearing may be
placed on social or conduct probation
or suspended from the Universi-
ty.’’ DeMovellan said if anyone has
questions or suggestions about the
above amendments to the White
Book, they should see an EC member
before next week’s meeting, when
these changes will be put into effect.

In other business, Junior EC Rep.
Jud Parker and Freshman EC Rep.
Clayton Kennington will look into
possible solutions for the complaints
that the EC has received about dogs
on campus.

DeMovellan said that he has heard
student concern about the presence of
dogs without leashes running around
on the campus. Kennington and Par-
ker will meet with Dean of Students
Lewis G. John and report back to the
EC on Monday.

In other business, the Men’s Vol-
leyball Club was granted a budget al-
location of $1,024. DeMovellan said
that the club "had a lot of interest and
a lot of leadership."

The Ariel’s budget was frozen
temporarily at the meeting because
the group did not post flyers at the
law school.

The Independent Union, Interna-
tional Club, Minority Student Asso-
ciation, Student Activities Board and
Trident all gave budget reports at the
mecting. The EC reported all the
above organizations as financially
stable.

Parker was late and Junior EC Rep.
Chris Giblin was given an excused
absence. The meeting lasted one hour
and 40 minutes.

the cost for the city services they use
with Lexington residents. Tax paying
citizens must compete with students
for available parking.

The city would face the difficulty of
finding the cars and the owners. The
Commissioner of Revenue, Courtney
Baker, contacted other towns and ci-
ties where colleges and universities
are located. Most of them responded
that locating the cars and students for
the tax was ‘‘worth the trouble’.

'88-'89 Registers are in Reid Hall

 

By Heather M. Midkiff
Staff Reporter

 

The student directories are
available at the Registrar’s office.

The directories, which contain per-
tinent information on the telephone
numbers, of students, faculty (both at
home and the office), fraternities and
dorm hall numbers are free for all stu
dents.

The directories are to be used be the

now

students instead of the Student Infor
mation Number, which has been
abused in the past

According to a memo written by

Lewis G. John, dean of students,
‘*The purpose of Student Information
is to provide information on how to

reach a student by phone or mail after

efforts in consulting either the current
register of faculty, staff and students,
the Lexington telephone book or the
Washington and Lee telephone direc
tory have failed. The message center
will contact students in case of emer
gency and make a reasonable effort to
reach a student if personal, depart
mental or staff efforts have failed
However, the primary responsibility
to contact a student lies with the ini
tiating party, as the message center
serves as a backup system. ””

Carol Ann Calkins, who is in
charge of Student Informa
tion/Message Center, says there have
been many instances of students call
ing the number when it was not neces
sary.

She also said, ‘*The student Infor
mation Number is manned by work
study students who are only here from
9 a.m. to 4 p.m. There is no one here
to answer the phone during evenings
or weekends.”’

Tax on Cars?

OPINION

 

WA&L students may soon see more money coming out of their
checkbooks in next year’s matriculation line.

Lexington is considering imposing a tax on vehicles owned by
W&L and VMI students who live in the city. If the measure is
passed, students could be paying as much as 5% percent of the
value of their car per year. In dollars and cents that translates into a
$990 tax on an $18,000 car.

Granted, not all student cars are worth $18,000, but a 5'4 percent
tax is nonetheless a substantial sum of money for any student to pay
to drive a car in Lexington for a year.

However, the city does have a legitimate reason for imposing a
tax on student cars (though not necessarily at the 5'2percent rate).
Lexington has a weak tax base and needs revenue to provide ser-
vices to city residents — students included. Those revenues help
pay to clean the streets of garbage and snow as well as help pay the
salaries of the policemen who ticket student cars.

Since students are not permanent residents of Lexington, they

: * receive these services for free. State law allows localities to charge

college students the difference between what students pay in per-
sonal property taxes at home, and what they would pay if they were

' citizens of the college town. Therefore, students living in localities

with a personal property tax rate lower than Lexington’s 5% per-
cent would be required to pay the difference. Since Lexington has
the highest personal property tax rate in Virginia, there will be a
difference to be paid, at least for in-state student car owners.
Lexington Mayor Buddy Derrick said in a News- Gazette article
last week that taxpaying citizens must vie with students for available

'+ parking in Lexington, yet the students are not sharing the burden of
_ * funding the city services they use, such as traffic control and street
;., Maintenance.

The vehicle tax is a fair tax — students should help pay for the
city services they use. But a reasonable rate not relative to vehicle
value would be a better alternative. It would alleviate the money

.« crunch on students and make it easier on town officials if everyone
' » has to pay the same price.

MY VIEW

: By Jon Sbar

 

The day was Monday October 31,

: 1988. My planned agenda for the
‘ evening included figuring out what

happened to the dinosaurs, writing a
‘novel, and deciding if God really
’ exists. But, suddenly, I was in Ancient
: China eating lunch with Ghangis Khan
-(note: I was having an out-of-body
experience). ‘‘Fred’’ (Khan’s nick-
name) told me to go trick-or-treating
so I finished dessert, paid my bill, and
came back to my body.

Immediately, I called up a few
friends from the neighborhood and
they said I could tag along. Then I
‘turned to the problem of a costume. I
thought about going as a transvestite
from the third moon of Jupiter, but
decided it was too mundane. I wanted
something different, something dar-
ing, something my 11-year-old friends
would remember: I wanted to be
«Charles Manson.

The door bell rang - my friends
were ready. One was Godzilla and the
,other was Mother Theresa. We were
in a big hurry. It was already 6 p.m.
-and we had to be in by 9 p.m. Armed
with pillow cases for candy, and flu-
orescent lightsticks for crossing the
street, we attacked the neighborhood.

: After the first couple of hours I real-
: ized something was wrong. As soon as
: homeowners saw me they got stingy. I
' was getting sugar-free sucking candy
: while Mother Theresa was raking in

: quarter-pound chocolate bars. Even if

‘I was the only trick- or-treater in the
‘country with a driver’s license, it still

H:L.R.

A Night with Charles
‘Manson and Friends

wasn’t fair. I didn’t want to admit it,
but deep in my heart I knew it was my
Charles Manson costume. For centur-
ies, Halloween bigots have rewarded
good characters like Mother Theresa
while persecuting evildoers like me
and Jack-the-Ripper. I was sorry to
see the ugly head of discrimination
reared on a sacred holiday like Hal-
loween. Besides, it was cutting into
my candy profits. To make up for
these losses, I needed a costume
change and I needed it quick (it was
almost 9 p.m.). I decided to be
Ghandi. In a matter of minutes, I stole
a white robe and shaved my head. Bi-
got homeowners responded generous-
ly to this positive character, stuffing
my pillowcase with blank checks and
Swedish chocolates. By 8:30 I had
enough candy to retire on. I knew that
I should have gone home but I
couldn’t stop. I was infected. I had to
have more candy.

Against the better judgment of God-
zilla and Mother Theresa, I stayed out
past curfew. By now it was 10:45 and
I was a few blocks from my house.
Turning a corner, I froze in my tracks.
Less than ten feet away from me was a
pack of big kids (12 or 13). They were
armed (with shaving cream and eggs),
hostile and dangerous. I had to hide.
Where? The bushes. Too late, they
see me. I turned and ran for home but
my bag was too heavy to stay out in
front. Like a pack of hungry hyenas
chasing an antelope, they dragged me
down. They snared my loot and
cracked eggs in my shoes. I was left
with nothing but a white robe and a
shaved head.

The moral of this story is obvious:
If you go trick-or- treating next year,
carry a concealed hand gun.

Ignorance of International Politics

 

MY VIEW
By Julia Kirk

 

On Monday I asked twenty-five
people ten questions about the ‘inter-
national political scene.’ This article
will be devoted to recounting their an-
swers.

The first question concerned
France. I asked for the name of the
president, his political party, and the
name of the prime minister. Eighteen
people knew that Francois Mitterand
was the president, seventeen knew
that he was a socialist. No one knew
the prime minister’s name, although
seven mistakenly believed that Chirac

MY VIEW
By Elizabeth Parkins

 

In the waning hours of the morning
I sit here attempting to come up with a
suitable topic for a My View this
week. The last two I conjured up were
vetoed over-whelmingly by both my
roommate and the boy who lives up-
stairs.

‘*Too mushy, sentimental, that stuff
should be saved for the end of the year
when it really means something,”
they both said.

So, into the garbage can they went
(well, actually I kept a copy for future
reference) and I still had no My View.

still held the post. Question number
two is an embarrassment to us all. One
(!!!) person knew the current president
of Mexico’s name (congratulations to
Christopher deMovellan). No one
knew the president-elect’s name.

My third question, ‘‘Who is the
president of South Africa?’’ met with
mixed success. Thirteen people knew
that Botha was president, one believed
that Tutu was chief executive, and
eleven didn’t know. Question number
four asked for the name of El Salva-
dor’s president; nine people knew it,
sixteen people did not. The fifth ques-
tion, ‘‘Who is the president of Nicara-
gua?’’ was a disappointment given
U.S. involvement in that country.
Only thirteen people knew that Ortega
occupied the post, three thought that
Noriega did, and nine didn’t know.

One thing did strike me however,
and on the suggestions of several
friends, I would like to expound on the
work of several of my classmates. My
freshman year several girls got
together and decided that a women’s
soccer team was needed. So in the
cold, dark hours of a January night the
two ran from dorm to dorm gathering
the needed signatures to form a team.
All-in-all they came up with a list of
15 girls.

Coach Piranian was soon enlisted to
help and come spring, the team started
practicing. There was a considerable
increase in participants though, with
28 women coming out to the field. In
the days when there were only 100
women here, this 28 percent was sig-
nificant.

Four years and a coach later, the

When asked, ‘‘Who is Yitzhak .

Shamir?’’ eleven people responded
correctly, three held misconceptions
about his identity (one believed he was
the ‘‘head of the PLO’’), and six
didn’t know. Question number eight
queried, ‘‘Who is Juan Carlos?’’ Nine
people knew, three believed he played
pro-baseball, one believed he was a
Colombian coffee bean pickler, one
believed he was an international terro-
rist, and eleven didn’t know.

The question, ‘‘Who was Tito’’
garnered twelve correct responses,
eight ‘no clues’, and four incorrect
answers including, ‘‘Dorothy’s dog,’’
“‘an Argentinean dictator,’’ and *‘Mi-
chael Jackson’s older brother.’’ The
final question, ‘‘What nation political-
ly and economically supports Soma-
lia?’’ received eight correct answers,

eight incorrect answers, seven ‘‘no
clues’’ and eighteen ‘‘Where the hell’s
Somalia?’’s. ‘
Four people refused to answer the
survey on the basis of political illitera-
cy. The most common response was,
“‘Are you trying to show how ignorant
I am?’’ but ‘‘Who cares about this’
crap anyway,’’ ran a close second,
“*Yeah, well what do you know about
finance?”’ was a distant third. :
To those among you who know the:
answers to the above questions I offer
my congratulations, you seem to be ah

rarity here at W&L. To those, who in. \

reading this article find they have ‘no

team is considered a growing power-
house. Six players have won post
season honors in two of ODAC com-
petition and this year W&L sported
the premier ODAC coach when Jan
Hathorn was named Coach-of-the-
Year. °

So what? The point is, coeducation
has worked in many ways that are just
beginning to come to a fruition. In the
last several years the Class of ’89 has
somehow been lost in the shuffle. In-
creasing enrollment standards have
brought gifted, enthusiastic students
who come to this campus with many
programs already in place. (That’s not
to say that when we got here there
were no programs, it’s just that with
new women at W&L some things
needed to change.) Both men and
women helped to form many neces-

sary organizations and groups.

It is necessary then, to remember
those students who have spent man’
hours organizing and building. Bu.
more importantly, the students who
follow the Class of ’89 must continue
to contribute to the University. They
will be able to expand and create new *
opportunities for both themselves and
the students to follow. Washington
and Lee is ever evolving and it is up to
the students to see that it does not
stagnate.

Well, as for the team, soccer is over
forever now for those original Class

of ’89 members. The rest of the team '

sent us off with much (appreciated)
fanfare and yes, some sadness. But |

look to them with trust to continue the »

traditions that we have started.

Putting the Ring-tum Phi to bed.

Daniel Coffey:

I must be a traditionalist because I was

cation at the university from which my
father and grandfather also graduated.
My favorite extracurricular activity

Impact of World War II; friendships;
everything under Fitz Flournoy; stu-

The lasting friendship made with both
fellow students and faculty. I re-
member having new areas of interest
opened to me by energenic and en-
thusiastic faculty.

Marshall Follo:
Friends, teachers, learning to pay at-
tention to words.

John Gunn:

My strongest sense of Washington and
Lee over 47 years’ observation is the
essential continuity of the things that
matter most.

Patrick Hinely:

That during my tenure as a student,
frat membership fell under the 50%
mark (of the total student body) for the
only time since WW II . That students
voted in favor of coeducation. That
Nixon won the student poll but
McGovern carried the faculty poll.
That the general feeling was that
Watergate was a minor foible which
the Nix would squirm his way out of.
That I didn’t expect this school to be-
come coeducational in my lifetime. It
still amazes me. I’m glad I came back.

Professor James G. Leyburn’s incom
parable classes, Coach Lee McLaugh
lin’s leadership on the athletic field,
the quiet dignity of President Fred
Cole and Bob (Murph) Murray's vain
attempts to beat me in handball.

David McLeod:

How at home I felt at W&L being able
to talk to the deans and the president
of the university. I don’t think I could
have gone to another school
where the president knew me well
enough to call me up and ask me to
play ping-pong with him.

ever

William McHenry:

The excitement on campus when our
football team upset nationally ranked
(Sth) Virginia 42-14 in 1951.

Timothy McMahon:

Junior year I turned someone in for an
Honor Violation; he went public, and
testifying was difficult considering the
consequences. Still, that day was the
first time I knew what it meant to be a
part of this university.

Lex McMillan:

Warm days, cold nights, loud music,
gifted teachers, new knowledge, old
wisdom, rapid changes, foolish mis-
takes, forgiveness, encouragement
and love.

Holt Merchant:

The opportunity to study with a num-
ber of talented and dedicated teachers.
The two men who had the greatest in-
fluence on me were Olliger Crenshaw
and Allen Moger. They showed me
why I loved history, they encouraged
me to continue my work beyond
W&L, and they made it possible for
me to have a life in academics. I could
never thank these men enough for
what they have done for me.

Edgar Spencer:

My first view of the colonnade the
night I arrived in Lexington from Ar-
kansas; hikes in the country; fellow
students who will remain lifelong
friends; a few teachers who changed
my views of the world I knew and in-
troduced me to worlds I did not know
existed.

Mike Stachura:

So much happens over four years, it’s
hard to point to one isolated event. But
when graduation day came and Presi-
dent Wilson mentioned my name in
his remarks at graduation, I guess I
had the feeling that I had accompli-
shed something in my four years here,
other than earn a degree. It made me
feel good to know that I had been a
part of this institution.

I remember most the faculty’s support
of my endeavors and their willingness

vices and reference librarian at Wash-
‘ington and Lee University, served as a
contributing writer for an American

4 ‘government textbook, We the People,

,

published this month by Holt, Rine-
hart and Winston.

Hays wrote the historical essays that
are included as special features in each
chapter of the text to help students bet-

+ ter understand why government has

grown and changed. The essays cover
such diverse topics as women’s suf-

« frage, the McCarthy era and citizen-

ship for native Americans.
In addition to writing the essays,

« Hays served as a reader and consultant

for the manuscript, specifically to in-

¢ clude more material on women and

minorities.

WA&L trivia
answered

By Caly Smith
Staff Reporter

 

 

Answers to last week’s trivia:

The Egyptian God Anubis is found
on a mural in the Commerce School.

W&L’s first professor of penman-
ship and bookkeeping was Professor
C.M. Koones.

The *‘Ranches’’ were old apartment
houses where students lived on Pres-
ton St. and in Red Square when there
were no fraternities.

The Commerce School was first re-
ferred to as ‘‘The School for Graft’’
between 1903-1905.

The ‘‘calics’’ were local girls.

Newspapers across the country
falsely reported that the Natural
Bridge burned down in 1873.

W&L’s women’s singing group, Jubilee, entertains a crowd in Lee Chapel last weekend as part of the 34th annual Parent’s

Weekend.

By Henry Ferris
Staff Reporter

 

At 4:07 on Tuesday afternoon a
gunshot sent almost 200 members of
the student body into a wild dash
across the law school fields. Less than
twenty minutes later, junior David
Martin broke alone from the woods to
easily win the annual Washington and
Lee Turkey Trot.

“It was pretty tough, especially the
last hill,’ Martin said of the women’s
five kilometer cross-country course on
which the race took place. A member
of the Washington and Lee indoor and
outdoor track teams, Martin credited
his victory to his training for the 1500
and 3000 meter events which he will

run this spring. His time of 19 minutes
and seven seconds was over a minute
faster than the second place finisher,
sophomore Bruce Taylor. Law 1 rep-
resentative JohnJohnson placed third.

Not all who ran the 3.1 mile course
through the mountains and along the
Maury River were in the race to win
it. One participant called his finish a
“‘moral victory,’’ although he had
been forced to walk portions of the
course due to an upset stomach. All of
the racers were cheered on by mem-
bers of the varsity cross-country teams
who were placed along the course to
watch and direct the runners through
the rugged terrain.

After the last finisher had crossed
the line, the results were taken back to

the intramural office where they were
tabulated. The Turkey Trot is a major
event on the schedule for the fall in-
tramural season. After tabulating the
number of participants and the finish-
ing times, Law 1 received 100 points
for winning the overall race. Sigma
Alpha Epsilon was second, gaining 95
points, and Phi Delta Theta finished
third, accumulating 90 points.

When it was over, most of the 173
finishers seemed winded but happy
that the race was over for another
year. Sophomore Gary Maxa summed
up the event for most of the competi-
tors by saying, ‘After this race, you
realize how out of shape you really

Freshmen create
new hall lounge

By Chris Baradel
Staff Reporter

 

should be resurrected into a viable en-
tertainment center.

The lounge contains a television
mounted on a stand with a small couch
and a chair providing seating capacity
for three. According to Joy, it costs
about $300 to furnish the room, half
of which came from a $2000 fund for
freshmen activities. The other half
came difectly from the pockets of the
twenty guys living on the hall where
the room would be located.

Freshmen Steve Ross said, ‘‘Ever-
yone gave about eight bucks. I think
the television room is a good idea for
people who don’t have a TV or
cable.’’ That comment typifies the
support the room has among those
who repose there. Scott Miller, an-
other freshmen, said, ‘‘It gives me
something to do between classes when
I don’t have any work.”’

However, Ross did voice one com-
plaint: ‘‘The room the lounge is in a
way too small. It only seats three peo-
ple comfortably." Miller raised an-
other problem. ‘‘Often there will be
people there who haven’t contributed
any money.’’ But Miller stressed that
people who did pay would not banish
anyone from the lounge for that
reason.

In the last few years, the admissions
department at Washington and Lee
has made a conscious effort to recruit
and enroll the brightest students avail-
able from across the country. No
doubt at some point in their prep-
aration for college these students were
indoctrinated with the wisdom the ear-
liest settlers have passed down to us,
such as the old adage, ‘‘Necessity is
the mother of invention.’ Rest as-
sured that the residents of the fourth
floor of Graham-Lees who live on
Dorm Counselor Ed Joy’s hall were
well prepared, and learned that prov-
erb properly. When they were faced
with the problem that many freshmen
know all too well; plenty of leisure
time and no television set to squander
it in front of, they put that old lesson
to work, banding together and raising
money to convert an old storage room
into a television lounge for them-
selves.

Joy said, ‘‘Everyone on the hall said
they wanted a television room. They
came to me and I went to Dean Rus-
cio.’’ Ruscio agreed with Joy and the
freshmen that the empty storage room

Politics Flick

The Washington and Lee Film
Society is pleased to announce its
next presentation, ‘‘Rosa Luxem-
burg’’ (West Germany, 1985), dir-
ected by Margarethe von Trotta.

Showings will be at 8:00 p.m. on
Friday November 11 and Saturday
November 12 in Lewis Hall Class-
room ‘‘A.’’ There is no charge for
admission. The film is in German
and Polish, with subtitles.

Director Von Trotta (‘*Marianne
and Juliane,’ ‘‘Lost Honor of
Katherina Blum,’’ and others) pre-
sents a sweeping portrayal of the
life and times of Rosa Luxemburg,
‘Red Rosa,’’ one of the most
extraordinary political figures of
this century. Barbara Sukowa de-
livers a wonderful performance as
the woman whose very active pol-
itical career included opposition to
the czarist government in Russian
Poland, revolutionary opposition
within Germany to the German
government during World War I,
and a role as one of the most
powerful and persuasive propon-
ents of radical politics on the inter-
national scere.

dication to Christianity. The main
focus of the evening , however,
will be when the floor is opened up
and the audience is encouraged to
share what they are personally
thankful for. The event is being
sponsored by a student fellowship
group. It is designed to bring the
town, the faculty and the students

Another W&L student was robbed
of more than $3,500 worth of personal
belongings on Oct. 29th after someone
broke into his house at 7 Tucker St., a
Lexington police report said.

Allen Thomas McConnell, 21, of
Dallas, Texas, told police that
someone entered his house between
10:30 p.m. Saturday and 1 a.m. Sun-
day and stole several things from his
living room, the report said. Among

the articles stolen were a Rolex watch,
a VCR, and $40 cash, the report said.
McConnell said everything stolen was

in the living room.
The report said the thief probably

walked in the front or back door since

neither doors were locked and no
traces of forced entry were found.

No suspects have been found.

‘ball Generals to a 10-6 Parents’
‘Weekend victory over Ursinus Satur-
) day on Wilson Field.

» The Grizzlies (2-7) scored on a
20-yard interception return by line-
backer Todd Klinedinst just four

,minutes into the game and picked off

‘another Sampson pass six minutes
jlater. But sophomore slotback Carl
‘Gilbert sizzled the Grizzlies’ defense
}for a 44-yard touchdown reception be-
tween the two Sampson turnovers,
and Carter Quayle’s extra point with
,7:18 left in the opening period proved
‘to be the difference.

The Generals (4-3-1) would add a
(32-yard Quayle field goal in the fourth

uarter, but Ursinus turnovers and
theavy rain in the second half com-
bined with a strong W&L defensive
effort to keep the Ursinus offense
‘scoreless and assure the Generals of a
‘record no lower than .500 for the first
hime since 1985.
+ Ursinus took the opening kickoff
but moved the football only 22 yards
before punting to the W&L 15. Senior

ilback Tony Waskiewicz picked up
Five yards on two plays before Kline-

, dinst stepped in front of a Sampson

pass, and the Ursinus linebacker raced
into the endzone untouched.

Dave Lockhart came on to kick the
extra point, and the W&L defense
blocked his point after. But there were
12 Generals on the field, and the
half-the-distance-to-the-goal-line pen-
alty gave Ursinus coach Steve Gilbert
all the incentive he needed to go for
two.

‘*He had two kicks blocked earlier
in the season against Catholic Univer-
sity,’’ said W&L coach Gary Fallon,
‘so, early in the game, he probably
was willing to take a chance.”

But Ursinus running back Joe Zir-
polo was stopped short of the goal
line, and the Grizzlies’ lead was held
to six.

And it wouldn’t last long. The Gen-
erals drove 84 yards in nine plays, but
they needed only one play for the last
44 —the Sampson TD pass to Gilbert.

‘‘Carl had him [the Ursinus defen-
der] beat even on a dry field,’’ said
Fallon, ‘‘and when their guy slipped
in the mud, he really had him beat.’

Quayle’s extra point would be all
the scoring W&L needed. The Gen-
erals allowed Ursinus across _ their
20-yard line only once all day, and the
Grizzlies never crossed the W&L 10.

The Generals were also helped by
four Ursinus turnovers. Quarterback
Brian Thomas maintained his two
interceptions per game average,
thanks to a little help from W&L de-
fensive backs Bobby Rimmer and
Brad Miller, and the Generals re-

covered two Ursinus fumbles.

Rimmer, a junior, ended a 59-yard
Ursinus drive in the second quarter
when he picked off a Thomas pass in
the end zone. Then, after a punt by
senior Tom Skeen gave Ursinus the
ball back, W&L defensive tackle Jim
Johnson sacked Thomas and knocked
the ball loose, and senior tackle
Hughes Melton recovered for the
Generals.

When it rains, it pours, and it rained
heavily in the second half Saturday —
and all of it fell on the Grizzlies. A
third-quarter fumble by Thomas was
recovered by W&L sophomore free
safety Clark Wight, and Miller, a jun-
ior, intercepted a Thomas pass to halt
the Grizzlies’ final drive of the game.

HASHMARKS— W&L has won
four of its last five games and is 4-1-1
in its last six. A victory in their season
finale against Washington University
(2-7) Saturday in St. Louis would give
the Generals their first winning season
since 1985, when W&L was 7-2....
The Grizzlies netted only 58 yards of
offense in the second half.... The
W&L defense has allowed only 32
points in five straight games and only
42 in its last six.... Skeen, one of
W&L’s two starting linebackers,
made 14 tackles Saturday and 60 in
W&L’s last four games. Junior Mike

Sunday will be a day that the Wash-
ington and Lee water polo team would

 

just as soon forget. The Generals’
worst scenario came true. W&L had a
bad day in the pool while the Univer-
sity of Arkansas-Little Rock Trojans
were playing a great game. These two
factors resulted in a 14-6 loss for the
Generals and a Southern League
Championship for the Trojans.

The game started off on the wrong
foot for W&L as the Generals fell be-
hind 2-0 halfway into the first quarter.
Once the Generals were on the down
side of the scoreboard they were never
able to recover. The Trojans contin-
ued their barrage of scoring and led
after the first half 7-1.

It was obvious at this point that the
Generals needed to score almost every
time they had the ball in the second
half but when Arkansas scored first
early in the third quarter the game
was, for the most part, decided.

The Trojans moved the ball with
precision and quickness that seemed to
overwhelm the Generals from the very
start. Arkansas was getting a good
shot almost every time they had pos-
session. This was the difference in the
game. W&L was unable to make any
progress against a tough Arkansas de-

fense. The Generals’ typical posses-
sion was one or two passes, then a
turnover or a bad shot.

The Generals’ poor play was a re-
sult of Arkansas distracting them early
in the game. The Trojans came out
playing very physically and the effect
seemed to work in their favor. This
rough play had a couple of players
concentrating on revenge instead of
water polo.

‘**A couple of our guys were out

Trojans roll past W&L ©
in league polo finals

there head hunting instead of playing ~
water polo. We lost our composure {
due to the type of game the officials al- .

lowed Arkansas to play. Their offi-
ciating complemented their style of
game,”’ said head coach Page Remil-
lard.

The Generals will now move on to

the Eastern Championships that will.
be held at Brown University this -

weekend. The first round game for

W&L will be against —guess who »

—Arkansas.

‘This game should be a little
different. We will be playing in a

longer pool which should be to our “

advantage. The pool will also be an all
deep pool which will change things
around as well. I am really looking
forward to some better officiating
which we will get up at Brown,”’ said
senior co-captain David Reavy.

4] The Washington and Lee
women’s volleyball team, which
finished its first season with the
+] best record ever of any first- year
women’s team at W&L, had its
season come to a close with a dis-
«| appointing outcome at the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
Tournament.

‘| The Generals, 15-9 and 4-5 in
the ODAC during the regular
season, were hit with injuries very
early in the first match of the tour-
nament. Senior co-captain Melissa
Thrasher and freshman starter
Marcy Brown went down with in-
juries in the first game, and the
Generals had to struggle to stay on
‘| their feet the rest of the way.

‘| W&L dropped its first two mat-
ches of the tournament, losing to
Emory and Henry 15-2, 15-7 and
‘| top-seeded Bridgewater 15-9,
15-0. But the Generals rallied for a
'| win in their final game, beating
Mary Baldwin 15-9, 12-15, 15-9.

tournament, and that was dis-

with what we accomplished this
year.”’

 

The W&L men’s soccer team
closed out its season with a 1-0 win

Junior Scott Levitt provided the

Nothing wrong with third-place finishes for x-country

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

Third place doesn’t sound like anything all that
great to achieve. But for the Washington and Lee
men’s and women’s cross country teams, a third-
place finish in Saturday’s Old Dominion Athletic
Conference championships would mean the Gen-
erals ran as well as could be expected.

Letting powerful Lynchburg and Eastern Men-
nonite battle it out for the conference champion-
ship, the men’s team put together a solid perfor-
mance and grabbed third place out of the seven-
team field. The Generals were led, as usual, by
senior Bill Clark, who finished fourth in a time of
28:45 over the 5-mile course. Freshmen Charles
Edwards (8th, 29:05) and Lee Parker (19th, 30:26),

junior Joe Geitner (24th, 31:12) and freshman Bill
Benson (30th, 32:23) were the other scorers for
W&L. Both Clark and Edwards were named to the
all-conference team on a day when heavy rains af-
fected everyone’s times.

‘*Both teams ran well,’’ said men’s head coach
Dick Miller. ‘‘We ran up to our capabilities. I think
everybody performed well despite adverse weather
conditions.

“It was a very nasty day. Thank goodness it was
primarily a pavement course — which I don’t like to
begin with — but it gave pretty reasonable footing
most of the time.”’

The women’s team would not be outdone by the
men. Led by sophomore Paige Cason, the defend-
ing ODAC champion, the women took third place
as well, with Eastern Mennonite and Lynchburg
finishing one-two respectively. Cason finished fifth
with a time of 21:27 for the 3.1-mile course and

was named to the all-ODAC team for the second
year in a row. She received support from sopho-
more Cecily Tynan (10th, 21:56), freshman Erika
Ingersoll (14th, 23:46), senior Stephanie Smith
(16th, 24:06) and sophomore Heather Jenkins
(18th, 24:19).

Both teams now will travel to the University of
the South (Sewanee, Tenn.) for the NCAA Division
III South/Southeast Regional Championships on
Saturday. The top men’s team plus the top three in-
dividual finishers (not from the top team) will qual-
ify for the national championships which will be
held at Washington University (Mo.) on Nov. 19.
The top women’s team plus the top four individuals
will qualify for the national championships. Last
year, Clark was named to the all- South/Southeast

” Regional team.

‘*Probably Emory [University] is the team to beat

again,’’said Miller of the men’s race.

had so much potential. It's really dis-
appointing that it didn’t deliver.’ A
perfect quote, for a very imperfect
film

Alien Nation stars James Caan
(Brian’s Song, The Godfather, Gar-
dens of Stone) as Matthew Sykes, a
cop whose partner gets literally blown
away by one of the ‘‘newcomers’’ and
Mandy Patinkin (Yentl, The Princess
Bride) as Sam Francisco (George) the
first newcomer promoted to the rank
of Detective on the L.A.P.D..
Together, Caan and Patinkin work to
find the ‘‘slag’’ who killed Caan’s
partner, but find themselves trapped
in the beginnings of a drug war in-
stead.

According to Francisco, his people
were genetically engineered to be
slaves on their home planet and to
keep them in control, the government
developed a super drug ten times more
potent than earth’s strongest drug.
The drug was used as a reward for
hard work so that the harder the
workers worked, the more drug they
got and the more drug they got, the
harder they worked. The drug seemed
simple, but there was some secret
about it that Francisco refused to tell
anyone.

No one on earth knew about the
drug so it wasn’t available until an en-
trepreneurial alien organized a group
to manufacture the drug. And now we
have a story line. Problem ? Yeah, be-
cause that’s where the quality part of
the film ends.

writer had ten months to write a
screenplay and spent nine and a half
weeks writing the first half of the film.
The beginning of the film is quite en
joyable and is full of witty, interesting
dialogue. There are twists and turns
and deadends where you thought you
had figured everything out, but hadn’t
and just when you are ready for the
climactic point in the film, it dies.

James Caan, Mandy Patinkin, and
Terence Stamp as the drug kingpin of
the newcomers are all quite good and
give more than adequate performan-
ces but the script and the speed of the
film really let them down. As I said,
the beginning of the film was very en-
joyable but the end races and leaves
more than a few questions unresolved.
The special effects are all right and the
storyline is intelligent. It’s too bad the
directors and writers couldn’t get the
speed right too.

If there was some saving grace for
this film it was that Caan’s partner at
the beginning was named Tuggle, but
lo, even that couldn’t save this dis-
appointment.

Thanksgiving is
around the corner

By Melinda Conkling
Staff Reporter

 

As exams begin to loom over W&L
and teachers start handing out tests
and term papers, it can only mean one
thing: Thanksgiving break. To many
students, Thanksgiving is 10 days to

‘work on term papers, but traditionally

’
'

‘
‘

‘

,

‘

it is a time for families to unite and
give thanks for all that they have.

Thanksgiving, one of two national
holidays, was proclaimed so by Wil-
liam Bradford in 1623, two years after
the historic first celebration with the
Indians in the Plymouth Colony. The
Pilgrims established this day to thank
God for the bountiful harvest He had
given them so they could survive an-
other winter. The Indians also partici-
pated in the festivities because they
had taught the pilgrims how to plant
and fish.

Thanksgiving is celebrated the
fourth Thursday in November and like
all holidays, Thanksgiving means
different things to different people.
‘*Thanksgiving is getting together
with all your relatives, eating, and
having a good time,’’ stated sopho-
more Cecily Tynan.

Amnesty

Staff Reporter

 

 

U-2, Sting and concerts were
among the replies W&L students
made when asked what they first
thought of upon hearing the words
‘*Amnesty International.’’

These reactions are because of the
widely publicized Amnesty Interna-
tional tours in 1986 and 1988 that
were produced to expand public
awareness of the human rights group.

The tours were widely successful in «+

achieving their goal. In the 1986-87
school year, the number of student
groups doubled from less than 200 to
nearly 500, and is still increasing.

W&L saw the formation of an Am-
nesty International chapter here last
year, largely through the efforts of a
single student. Many may remember
the all-day concert on the Colonnade
last spring that was sponsored by the
W&L Amnesty International chapter.
Once again, good music and good
times.

But to about 40 W&L students,

Different factions of the W&L
community celebrated Thanksgiving
this week. On Monday night, Evans
Dining Hall sponsored a Thanksgiving
dinner. They offered a special turkey
dinner complete with candlelight and
cloth napkins. Dorm counselors car-
ved the turkeys, which were accom-
panied by other traditional Thanksgiv-
ing favorites, like mashed potatoes,
peas, pumpkin pie, and apple cider.
‘*It was awesome, and just what the
school needed to promote a communal
Thanksgiving spirit,’’ summed up
Head Resident Assistant Esther Huff-
man.

To further promote the communal
Thanksgiving spirit, an informal
Thanksgiving service was held in Lee
Chapel on Tuesday night. Accompan-
ied by guitars, the participants sang
songs of thanks, and then opened the
program to the audience for them to
contribute what they were thankful
for. Answers ranged from friends at
W&L to thanks for the break, as well
as thanks for the opportunity to be
ourselves. ‘‘I’m thankful for the in-
credible beauty that God has given us
and the ability to perceive it,’’ stated
senior Elisabeth Fowler.

celebrates human rights

Amnesty stands for much more than
good music. Amnesty stands for hu-
man rights work, helping release
prisoners of conscience and support-
ing the Universal Declaration of Hu-
man Rights.

W&L Amnesty International Coor-
dinator Eve Mullen explained that the
most effective action an Amnesty
chapter can take to further human
rights is to write ‘‘Urgent Action Let-
ters’’ for ‘‘prisoners of conscience.”’

According to Amnesty International
literature, prisoners of conscience are
people detained because of their be-
liefs, color, sex, ethnic origin, lan-
guage or religion who have not used
or advocated violence.”’

Amnesty International regional of-
fices supply each Amnesty chapter
with the names and addresses of
prisoners of conscience in need of
help. Then, each member of the chap-
ter writes an individual letter that
states who he is, what he is concerned
about and urges that the prisoner be
released or some other positive action
be taken.

The letters have had great success in

Faculty to review CRC
in January of 1990

By Stacy L. Morrison
Staff Reporter

 

The faculty voted not to accept
any of the student Executive Commit-
tee’s proposals for substitute forma-
tion of the Confidential Review
Committee, said President Christo-
pher deMovellan at the EC meeting
Monday night.

‘Basically, they decided they wan-
ted to let it ride for a year,’’ deMovel-
lan said. The faculty plans to review
the CRC in January 1990 after the
committee has been able to operate for
a full year, said deMovellan.

In other business, dogs will be al-
lowed to remain on the W&L campus
without any restraints, reported Junior
EC Rep. Jud Parker. ‘‘As it stands
now, dogs are not going to be bani-
shed,’’ Parker said.

Parker and freshman EC Rep. Clay-
ton Kennington spoke with Dean of
Students Lewis G. John last week
about dogs on the campus. The EC
had received a few complaints about
large dogs running loose on campus a

few weeks ago.

Parker reported that Dean John
spoke to the owners of some of the
dogs about the problem and felt that
no action was necessary right now.

The EC adopted the three White
Book revisions concerning the return
of transcripts of closed hearings that
the committee voted on last week. EC
by laws require that there be two votes
to revise the White Book.

The revisions state that all tran-
scripts of closed hearings given to
persons involved in an open honor
trial be returned to the EC after the
trial is concluded so the EC may des-
troy the transcripts.

Contact, the Field Hockey Club,
Mock Convention, the Ring-tum Phi,
the Rugby Club and the Soccer Club
all gave budget reports at the meeting.
The EC said that all these organiza-
tions are financially stable. The EC
voted $1,650 from the Mock Conven-
tion’s Sumners fund to its operating
budget.

Junior E.C. Rep. Chris Giblin was
given an excused absence, and Ken-
nington was late. The meeting lasted
approximately one hour.

moving political leaders to release
such prisoners, ind Amnesty Interna-
tional works on vehalf of almost 3,000
prisoners of conscience each year.

‘‘Letter writing puts international
pressure on governments who use
threats, imprisonment, torture and the
death penalty against their people. If
enough people write, the pressure is
enough to affect change,”” says a
booklet about Amnesty International.

Aside from urging the release of
prisoners of conscience, Amnesty
chapters support the Universal De-
claration of Human Rights that was
adopted by the United Nations Gen-
eral Assembly in December 1948.
This declaration contains 30 articles
that delineate the freedoms that are
‘*fundamental human rights, in the
dignity and worth of the human per-
son.””

The 30 articles range in tone from
Article 5: ‘*‘No one shall be subjected
to torture or to cruel, inhuman or de-
grading treatment or punishment,’” to
Article 24: ‘*Everyone has the right to
rest and leisure, including reasonable
limitation of working hours and

periodic holidays with pay.”’

To celebrate the 40th anniversary of
the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, Amnesty International chap-
ters signed petitions supporting the
declaration. The W&L Amnesty chap-
ter featured an animated version of the
declaration, in which top animators of
the world each did a 10-15-second clip
on one of the declaration’s articles.

The W&L Amnesty chapter also
will bring other activities to campus
soon. Mullen said after Christmas the
W&L chapter will sponsor an ‘‘AI
Week.’’ During that week, AI will
have speakers and information tables
on campus. These activities are ‘‘just
to try and get our name out,’’ Mullen
said at a recent Amnesty meeting.

W&L’s Amnesty chapter meets
twice a month to organize its activities
and, as always, to write Urgent Action
Letters.

‘If you belong to Amnesty Interna-
tional, you come to the meetings when
you can and write letters. That’s all it
takes,’’ said Mullen. ‘‘It’s a pretty
good way to spend a half hour of your
time every other week.”

indecision booked

By Christie Champlin
Staff Reporter

One of the bands has been announ-
ced for the Eleventh Washington &
Lee University Superdance, the an-
nual fund-raising event to benefit the
Muscular Dystrophy Association.
Superdance will take place the week-
end of February 3-4.

Indecision has been booked to play
Saturday night and negotiations are in
progress for another Saturday night
band. There will be a ‘‘Battle of the
Bands’’ competition on Friday night
and the winner will open for the bands
on Saturday. All of the slots for the
‘*Battle of the Bands’’ have not been
filled, so anyone with a band who
would like to play can contact Harry
Murphy or Allen Richardson for more
information, according to Fontanne
Bostic, the advisor of the dance and
Administrative Assistant of University
Services.

After last year’s Superdance the tote
board showed total donations for the
Muscular Dystrophy Association in
excess of $24,000 and committee
members are working to match that
total. This yeat the Superdance Com-
mittee is co-chaired by seniors Debi
Hurtt and Wright Ledbetter, with jun-
ior David Allen working as the vice-
chair.

The format of Superdance will
differ greatly from last year. Last year
the dance was a 15-hour marathon.
This year, the event will be a 15-hour
Superdance. The difference comes
with the breaking of the time into two
periods - half on Friday night and half
on Saturday night. The chairmen be-
lieve this will provide ‘‘an attractive
environment so that the W&L com-

for Superdance

munity and surrounding schoois cau
have a good time for a good cause,”’
said Ledbetter.

The change was made to attract
more dancers and spectators. ‘*We are
hoping for more dancers, because
they will not be committed during the
day on Saturday, and more spectators
because people come out at night for
entertainment,’’ said Bostic. Tickets
for weekend admission to all events
will be sold.

Dancer participation is vital to the
success of Superdance. The minimum
amount of pledges required to qualify
as a dancer is $100 for a single, or
$125 for a dancer and a date. This sum
must be collected in cash and/or
checks. Any pledges over the base
amount that are less than five dollars
must also be collected in cash or
checks.

The money donated by Superdance
to MDA is used for research and
patient services, which include wheel-
chairs, crutches, clinics, and camps.
“‘It is important that this year we take
a new look at Superdance and see it as
an opportunity to do something for
others and have a good time while do-
ing it,’’ said Ledbetter.

The grand prize will be awarded to
the person who brings in the largest
total with a combination of cash and
pledges. This prize has not been
determined, but a four day trip to Fort
Lauderdale is being investigated. The
second place prize will be a weekend
trip. A weekend trip will also be given
to the person who raises the most cash
donations. Donations raised by a cou-
ple will be divided and half will be al-
located to each member. Weekend
trips to the Williamsburg Hilton and
the Greenbriar have been finalized.

Visitor parking extends
parking problems

 

by Banks Ladd
Staff Reporter .

 

Last week, to the chagrin of many
students, three parking spaces in the
parking area known as the ‘‘corral’’
were designated for visitor parking
only. These three spaces are located at
the immediate right after one passes
through the War Memorial into the
Corral and are clearly marked. Ac-
cording to security officers, students
with registered cars will be ticketed if
caught parking in these spaces during
chapel hours.

When asked why these spaces were
designated for visitor parking, Assis-
tant to the President Frank Parsons
replied that the university has a re-
sponsibility to provide parking for Lee
Chapel. Lee Chapel has been declared
an historical landmark by the Com-
monwealth of Virginia and money for
the chapel and visitor parking has
been donated by various historical or-
ganizations. He also noted that the
parking area in the corral nearest Lee
Chapel has been marked for visitor
parking on the ‘‘Washington and Lee

University Parking Map,’’ but W&L
upperclassmen have been allowed to
park there because of the growing
parking problem that exists.

The reason for the recent designa-
tion of these spaces for visitors arises
from an incident that occurred earlier
this fall concerning a Lee Chapel
guest’s car that was towed for not
having a student parking sticker. The
security officers were not aware that
the car belonged to a /isitor and as-
sumed that the owner was in violation
of student parking regulations. De-
spite the efforts to accommodate visi-
tors, unmarked cars including those of
female fraternity guests and students
who failed to register their vehicles
may be the true beneficiaries of the
effort to provide visitor parking for
Lee Chapel guests.

On the subject of parking, Parsons
added that measures are being taken to
alleviate student parking problems.
Upon the advice of Phi Kappa Sigma
Fraternity members, the university
has recently leased the parking lot be-
tween Phi Kap and University
Cleaners to be used for upperclass
student parking.

Student Car Tax

City could raise up to $250,000

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

The high amount of tax-exempt
property in Lexington and the city’s
no-annexation agreement with Rock-
bridge County are the main reasons
behind the city’s move to consider a
tax on vehicles owned by local stu-
dents, according to City Manager
Joseph King.

Speaking to a journalism class
Tuesday at Washington and Lee, King
said 60 percent of the land within Lex-
ington’s city limits is owned by tax-
exempt agencies, such as churches
and schools.

And King said that figure is not
likely to change anytime soon because
Lexington has a revenue-sharing plan
with Rockbridge County that prohibits
any move by the city to extend its

W&L running smoothly Elrod says

 

by Heather M. Midkiff
Staff Reporter

 

Shortly after ithe Convocation to
the University, on Sept. 14, President
John D. Wilson took his first leave of
absence to Oxford University in order
to do some research. It was at that
time that the dean of the college, John

W. Elrod, stepped into the position
assigned to him by the board of
trustees as temporary president of
Washington and Lee University

Dean Elrod said he sees his position
of president as one of a *‘caretaker

my thought is to keep the university
yn a level keel.’ Dean Elrod
ishington and Lee

running

came to W Univer

sity during the summer of 1984. He is
a graduate of Presbyterian College
and a native of Griffin, Ga. He
received his master’s and doctorate at
Columbia University. He has, since
then, lectured on the philosophy of re
ligion at Union Theological Seminary
in New York City and was a professor
of philosophy at Iowa State Univer
sity. He came to W&L as a professor
of philosophy, vice president for aca-
demic affairs and dean of the college.
Dean Elrod said one reason for his
coming to W&L is the ‘‘opportunity
to work at a liberal arts college of high
distinction it iS an Opportunity to
work with a faculty and student body
of high quality.”’
Dean Elrod has not initiated any
new policies at the university during

the president’s leave. However, he
-urrently is the chairman of the steer-
ing committee.

‘The committee is engaged in a
long-range planning process of plan-
ning for the future of the university.
The committee will stay in existence
until December 1989,”’ he said.

Dean Elrod says that he has not ex-
perienced any unexpected difficulties
since President Wilson left. Further-
more, he has managed to accurately
divide his time so that his mornings
are spent in the office of the dean of
the college, while his afternoons are
spent in the president’s office.

He claims, however, ‘‘It has been

interesting to look at the university
from the point of the president's of-

fice; the president spends a lot more
time worrying about the university
than a dean does.’

He also mentioned that ‘‘a lot of the
administration has taken over addi-
tional responsibilities during the
president's absence."’

As for the students’ response to a
temporary transfer of power, Dean
Elrod said, ‘‘I think the students have
had a quiet fall. The university has
been on its best behavior; there ha-
ven’t been major problems or unex-
pected problems with the student
body. Everyone seems to be deter
mined to be on their best behavior
since their leader is gone.”’

President Wilson will return on the
the 15th of December.
   

Police Give
Their Side

In recent weeks, the Ring-Tum Phi editorial page has been very
critical of the Lexington Police Department. While I believe the an-
ti-police articles and cartoons were justified, I think our coverage of
the police department has been very lopsided. There are two sides
to every story and so far we have only shown one. I now seek to
correct this error.

Last week, I interviewed two policemen at the police department
— Sgt. A.M. Miller and Officer Jimmy Ruley. Both were obviously
dedicated to their work and sincerely concerned about problems be-
tween the community and the student body of W&L. I asked them
questions on the issues, which bring them the most criticism from
students — noise violations and speeding tickets.

I asked why the police give the fraternities in red square noise
violations when there are obviously no residential areas in the near
vicinity. Miller replied that while red square noise does not norma-
lly disturb residents, many of the other frats are in residential areas
and the police department constantly receives complaints from resi-
dents on loud nights. Since the police are forced to enforce the noise
ordinances for the fraternities in residential areas, to be fair they
also enforce them in non-residential areas.

Next I asked about the speeding tickets. The typical attitude on
campus in that Lexington is one big speed trap, the speed limits are
way too low and that the police prefer ticketing students over local
residents. Ruley answered that the speed limits are a product of the
narrow streets, which are very dangerous at fast speeds. Until the
streets are widened, the speed limits will remain fixed. Ruley added
that the main reason the streets haven’t been enlarged is to preserve
the historical significance of the university. Even before I asked
about tickets, Ruley assured me that when the police stop a car for
speeding, they stop it for speeding and only speeding. According to
him, the driver ofthe car makes absolutely no difference.

I also asked Sergeant Miller to give his opinions on the problems
between the community and the students. He seemed to feel that the
situation would improve if the students would start treating Lexing-
ton like they live here instead of a town they go to college in. He
added that the condescending attitude of students toward local resi-
dents has strained relations between the college and the community.
I agreed with Miller on this topic. I have frequently witnessed rude
behavior from students towards locals. On a positive note, Ruley
added that things have improved a lot in the last few years, especial-
ly with the fraternities.

I hope students will give serious consideration to the words of
these two policemen. I don’t think we give the police department
credit for providing one of the most important services in a city.
Police work is dangerous, demanding and usually thankless, but I
for one would not want to live in a city without the security of a
police department. In addition to the police officers I interviewed, I
also talked to Chief Beard. The department is open-minded and
willing to cooperate with the students. If you don’t believe me, go
to the department and talk to the police yourself. I know they will be
more than happy to discuss their policies and reasons behind them.

My four roommates and I live in
‘*Woods Creek.’’ Now, don’t get me
wrong. There are some pluses to on-
campus housing; they just escape me
at the moment. The proximity-to-the-
hill advantage is ruled out by the fact
that we have to rappel up a manure-
scented mountain to get to class every
morning. Let me tell you the saga of
life in ‘Woods Geek ’”...

We should have known last year
that our apartment (affectionately
called ‘‘the hole’’) would be trouble.
We discovered in a trip to see our new
‘*home,’’ that the former inhabitants
had furnished the living/dining area
with a bed. The dining room table, of
course, was on the balcony.

We're still not sure what they had
done with the rest of the Brady Bunch-
style furniture that miraculously ap-
peared to grace our apartment this
year. Steam iron burns in the carpet

that leads down the hall to the bath-
room also remain unexplained.

Did I mention our ‘‘accent walls’’?
According to a buildings and grounds
representative, ‘Woods Geek’’ build-
ings were ‘‘engineered’’ in order
to have an accent wall in each room.
ENGINEERED? Can I just tell you
that we have pea green, burnt orange
and puke yellow ACCENT WALLS
in our apartment?

There are many other perks to life
in ‘*Woods Geek.’’ We currently have
six cats and one ‘possum living
in a bush in our front yard, two wolf-
hounds on the loose, a ‘‘peeping
Tom’’ law student in the next building
and neighbors who break windows at
three in the morning.

Four of our seven window shades
are PERMANENTLY drawn. The
plumbing hangs above our toilet in a
way that defies all laws of gravity, and
we have a stall and three sinks in our
bathroom. Our shower head threatens
to fly off the wall at any moment — it
is a favorite theory that our heat and
shower do not function at the same
time. We arrived in September to find
a year’s supply of toilet paper dumped
beside our front door.

‘‘What’s wrong with that?’’ you
might ask. Well, nothing until a
freshman guy decided it was the per-
fect place to throw up.

The smallest noise is audible in
EVERY corner of the apartment; we
have no secrets here. One bedroom
remains 10 degrees colder than the
rest of the apartment (mine, of
course). The B&G man mumbled
something about the room being ‘‘eng-
ineered’’ without a heat duct as I re-
call.

Our kitchen, however, really takes
the prize. We have blown the only
existing socket in our kitchen twice in
four weeks, simply because we used
our microwave and toaster oven at the
same time. I had to disengage my
roommate from the microwave as she
cried ‘‘This can’t happen! My life
DEPENDS on this microwave!!’’ We
steamed our veggies and made cheese
toast in the hall for two days.

Our regular oven cuts the heating
time of most standard ovens in thirds.
In other words, Mrs. Stouffer’s Fro-
zen French Bread Pizza cooks in
eleven minutes instead of 38. Our
freezer door does not close properly
because permanent life sculptures

form inside.

Because B&G has no mop, my
roommate scrubbed two years of crud
off the floor on her hands and knees
before Parent’s Weekend.

These apartments also have no gar-
bage disposal; therefore the cats in the
front yard are treated to a steady diet
of fried chicken, chocolate chip coo-
kies and burnt pudding (thoughtfully
thrown over the balcony by a room-
mate). It’s a wonder she didn’t get
stung by one of the yellowjackets that
live out there.

But I feel safe here. We have a fire
extinguisher (that almost gave me a
concussion), a sprinkler system, and a
large red pull-down fire alarm in our
“living room.’’ We also have killer
wolfhounds patrolling the building. I
went down the stairs the other day to
discover a half-digested (dead) cat and
the culprit wolfhound. When I had
sufficiently »2covered enough to drag
a roommate down, I found other
‘Woods Geek’’ inhabitants, a Hefty
“‘body bag’’ with cat inside, and the
Subway delivery man holding his
nose. I love this place... and I promise
it’s all true.

Emancipate Man’s Best Friend

 

MY VIEW
By Jon Sbar

Due to a few problems caused by
unleashed dogs on campus, there has
been much talk by leash law advocates
of clamping down on dog freedom.
While the leash law advocates have
brought up some good points, they are
forgetting one important point. Un-
leashed dogs give Washington and
Lee its edge over other schools. If
dogs are restricted, the admissions of-
fice will be devastated. If it wasn’t for
dogs, I know I wouldn’t be here. I can
remember my visit to the campus in
my senior year of high school like it
was yesterday. I was thinking this:
This college is cold; it's four and a
half hours away from surfing; there
are more girls in auto mechanics class
back at high school; the classes look
hard and this honor code thing is over-
rated, i inal, wien cures if Ecan leave
my wallet in the library without
anyone stealing it? Why would I do
that anyway?

I was already thinking about getting
home so I could apply to the Univer-
sity of Florida when all of a sudden I
noticed there were unleashed dogs on
campus, generally in a state of pure
chaos. At that point, I knew W&L was
the school for me. One can only guess
how many students had this exact ex-
perience — probably thousands.

Another good thing about unleashed
dogs is it keeps people in class. I
mean, who would go to class if they
didn’t think there was a chance of a
dog stopping by to listen in on a lec-
ture (Note: Dogs prefer the philoso-
phy department).

Of course, there are more important
reasons for letting dogs roam free
other than admissions and academic
benefits. First of all, if dogs are lea-
shed, they can’t chase cats. And
everyone knows dogs have to chase
cats. Why? For one thing, it's tun. |

 

know some of the best years of my
dog's life have been spent in hot pur-
suit of terrified cats. Also, man’s best
friend has rights, too. My dog, a re-
cent law school graduate, is preparing
to go before the Supreme Court to ad-
vocate Amendment 44 (The Milk
Bone Bill), proposed by a Doberman
Pinscher from California. The
Amendment states: Congress shall
make no law abridging a Canine’s
freedom to roam free, dig through
garbage and chase cats and mail-
men.

Another reason dogs should be
guaranteed emancipation is their intel-
ligence. Next to dolphins and whales,
dogs are the smartest creatures on
earth. If you don’t believe this, con-
sider the recent Wall Street Journal ar-
ticle about Rex, the canine defendant
in a leash law arrest, who convinced
the jury to rule in his favor by balanc-
ing a dog biscuit on his nose. And then
there’s my dog who has a law degree
(I'm very proud of this) and watches
Lassie reruns with total comprehen-
sion.

The last reason for letting dogs run
free probably is more important than
Constitutional rights or intelligence.
Many of you might have noticed dogs
spend a lot of time sniffing grass,
barking at vacuum cleaners and dig-
ging holes, While those activities may
seem arbitrary, the truth is dogs have
a secret agenda. They are looking for
something very important. No one
knows exactly what, but researchers
agree that it's important. My confi-
dential sources tell me dogs are on the
brink of discovering a pollution-free
alternative to nuclear energy.

If this article has convinced you that
leashed dogs will destroy our campus
and maybe the universe, then I urge
you to do two things. First, join
PAAFD (People Advocating Anarchy
for Dogs), a for-profit organization
started by me right now (please send
me all your money, jewelry and kit-
chen appliances). Second, get psychia-
tric help immediately.

NEWS/OPINION

Let’s shape up!!!

 

by Heather Logan
Staff Reporter

 

“Uggh! I feel sooo fat! Wow! I am
s00o0 out of shape!’

Okay! so, what are you going to do
about it? Instead of patting your pro-
truding stomach and huffing and puff-
ing up four flights of stairs to a class
you've already overslept for, take
some time out and exercise. It will be

_ amazing how much better your pants

will fit when you can button the last
button and how much easier it will be

_ to make it on time over the last step if

you could just dedicate 30 minutes of

_ your day to some type of physical fit-

ness.

You do not have to be an athlete in
order to get any exercise. However,
as Coach Norman Lord says, ‘‘It is
important for you to enjoy doing the
things that will get you fit because,
that way, you will continue to do
them.”*

So, if you are prone to getting bored
with one activity, don’t just quit, find
something else that you like. Try do-
ing something different every day.

What to do? Well, believe it or not,
Lexington Va., is not devoid of things
to do in order to increase one’s physi-
cal fitness. Actually, there is a wide
variety of activities offered on and off
campus.

First, if you like to devise your own
workout, there are a multitude of faci-
lities available on campus that are eas-
ily accessible. The largest facility, the
Warner Center and Doremus Gym-
nasium, is open from 7 a.m to 10:30
p.m. This means that the basketball
courts, indoor track, racquetball
courts, squash courts and weight
room, which offers both universal
weight system and free weights, are
available between those hours except
for class and team times, which usua-
lly are (there are exceptions) between
11 a.m. and | p.m. and 4 to 6 p.m.

Since pools require lifeguards for
safety, their hours are restricted. The
lower level | pool (competitive pool,
25 yards) is open Monday-Friday 7 to
8 a.m. and noon-2 p.m.; Tuesday and
Thursday 7-8 p.m. and Saturday-
Sunday 4-5 p.m. The ‘‘old pool’’ on
level 3 is open Monday-Friday 5-6
p.m. Also, there is a Nautilus weight
room, including some free weights,
located in Gaines Hall across the street
from the gym, which is open to the
public from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. and to
faculty and Gaines residents between
8 and 9 a.m. and 10 and I1 p.m.

Besides these indoor facilities, the
tennis courts, upper and lower level,
and the track, which incidentally is
’ mile in circumference, also are
available for use at all times except
when occupied by sports teams. There
also are the Chessie and Woods Creek
trails, which not only make a good
jog, but also a scenic walk. And con-
trary to popular belief, the Chessie
Trail does not stop at the Water
Treatment Plant. For the avid nature
lover, it continues approximately 7-7
miles into Buena Vista.

Next, for the people who do not like
trying to find someone to play, run or
walk with, there are organized exer-
cise activities also available on and off
campus. Monday-Friday from 6 to 7
p.m., Anna Hampton, Debbie Hurt
and Catherine Boardman offer aerobic
workouts in the wrestling room. The
wrestling room is located behind the
basketball court in the Warner Center.
The workouts consist of 10 minutes of
warm up, 30 minutes of high impact
aerobics, and 20 minutes of floor
exercises. Fees are $10 a term and
new classes will begin winter term.

For adults and faculty, Lucinda Ran-
kin offers aerobics Monday, Wednes-
day and Friday from noon to | p.m.
Also on campus, the ROTC depart-
ment welcomes people to join them
for their physical training program
Monday, Wednesday and Friday from
7 to 8 a.m. The PT workout involves
stretching, conditioning (push-ups,
sit-ups) and aerobic exercise (circuits,
runs, sprints).

Moving to the off campus scene,
there are two dance studios, Halestone
Studio (463-744) and Lexington
School of Ballet (464-1620). Along
with these studios, the W&L PE de-
partment also is offering ballet and
modern dance classes for the first time
winter term. Another new opportunity
for W&L students is the Lexington
Fitness Center located on 16 E. Nel-
son St. above Hunter and Huntress.
The center offers aerobics, weight
training, and karate to people of all
skill levels. The membership fees are
$35 per month for three months or $30
per month for a year. For more infor-
mation, call 464-1-FIT.

If it’s a team activity you are inter-
ested in, then club sports might be the
solution. For information about the
club sports offered and to be offered,
contact the PE department. Another
alternative might be intramurals. This
year, along with the other intramural
sports normally provided, there also
are the Resident Halls Intramurals,
where people living in any type of
campus housing can participate. There
is a women’s club basketball team
forming from the Residents Hall In-
tramurals that meets every Monday
night. For more information about the
program or the club basketball team,
contact Mary Alice McMorrow.

Spanky’s
remodeled

By Holly Buffington
Staff Reporter

 

 

W&L students may have noticed
changes in Spanky’s main dining
room.

According to Jane Plogger, Span-
ky’s manager, the old paneling on the
main dining room walls was torn off
and a new concrete wall, was poured.
The ceiling was lowered, and a life-
size Spiderman was placed on it.

Plogger stressed that the wooden ta-
bles with various past and present stu-
dents’ names carved in them were left
as they are because of the sentimental
value attached to them by Spanky’s
customers.

Plogger said the changes were made
because Spanky’s wanted more of a
“‘party atmosphere.’’ Plogger feels
that the dining room is now ‘“‘much
prettier and brighter.’’

Spanky’s remodeling changes have
definitely helped business, drawing
‘“‘more older family types’’ to Span-
ky’s, according to Plogger, in addition
to their usual student customers.

Spanky’s own company construc-
tion workers were in charge of the
remodeling and spent approximately
$5,000. The remodeling, which took
two weeks, has been completed for
three weeks now.

Future remodeling plans for Span-
ky’s include the expansion of the bar
from six seats to one that will accom-
modate up to 40 customers. Plogger
predicts that this phase of the remodel-
ing will be completed by the first of

spring.

Spaces available

Staff Report

Faculty and staff who park on Let-
cher Avenue are urged to park only
with their vehicles headed downhill
toward Jefferson Street. Letcher
Avenue, which is privately owned by
W&L and not a city street, provides
important access for visitors to our
own Admissions Office and to VMI's
grounds as well. While ‘‘wrong way”
parking is tolerated on many residen-
tial streets in Lexington, this practice
S hot permitted on most of Lexing-
on’s downtown streets, nor on Let-
cher Avenue. Drivers with ‘*A”’
stickers who park headed the wrong
way on Letcher will risk tickets that
carry a $25 fine.

A new small parking lot with a ca-
pacity of about 20 vehicles is now
available to students with ‘‘C’’ stick-
ers on their cars. The lot is located be-
tween Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity
house and University Cleaners on Jef-
ferson Street. Only ‘*C’’ stickers are
permitted in this new area between 8
a.m. and 6 p.m.; violators are subject
to the customary risk of ticketing,
fines and towing.

The Democrats just don’t learn

 

MY VIEW
By Ray Welder

 

The election held two weeks ago
was an election on liberalism, and lib-
eralism lost. Once again, the Ameri-
can people told the Democratic party,
“If you send us a liberal, we'll send
him home.’’ And once again, Ronald
Reagan’s assertion that the American
people didn’t leave the Democratic
party— the Democrats left the people
— is held true.

. At the polls two weeks ago, not only
was Michael Dukakis defeated, but his

ideas on governing were defeated as
well. The American people said no to
socialized medicine. They said no to
having the federal government force
individual employers to provide all
types of insurance to employees. They
said no to being easy on criminals with
weekend furloughs. They said no to
the infringement on the right to bear
arms. They said no to allowing ho-
mosexual couples to adopt children.
They said no to having the IRS auto-
matically dock workers’ paychecks if
the worker owes the government
money (something that banks can't
even do). In short, the American peo-
ple said no to a bigger, more intrusive
government.

The election for the 41st president

will go down in history as a contest be-
tween ideologies. George Bush was
correct when he told the American
people this fall that there were stark
differences for governing between
himself and his opponent. Inherent in
Dukakis’ vision for America is the be-
lief that there exists some special elite
out there who can make better de-
cisions for individuals than the indivi-

duals can make for themselves. Bush
disagrees. The president-elect be-
lieves strongly that individual citizens
CAN make the best decisions concern-
ing themselves, and don’t need some

imposing, know-it-all bureaucrat tell-
ing them how to do things.
The American people have spoken.

But will the Democrats listen? Recent
evidence suggests they don’t even
want to hear. In last Sunday's Wash-

ington Post, for example, the Demo-
crats began to make excuses that
dodge the real issue on why they lost.

Come on, the coffee is brewing; it is
time for the Democrats to wake up and
smell it. The Democrats have losi five
of the last six presidential elections.
Surely it is time for the Democratic

party to gain the gumption to stop
making excuses and ask themselves,
“Can something be wrong with our
message?’

If they don’t hurry, they just might
excuse themselves into oblivion.

 

To the Editors: :

The parking terrorists have struck again! Three
of the spaces in the corral, the lot most dear to all
students, have been stripped away. Three spaces
do not matter so much given the enormous park-
ing problem that we. face— the problem that the
university continues to ignore. But it does matter
that our rights continue to be blatantly disregar-

ded. They have given these parking spaces to visi-
tors who can park anywhere in the downtown
area’s ‘‘two-hour’’ parking zones. These zones
are not at all feasible for students. How many stu-
dents spend only two hours on the Hill at a time?
The corral is about the only lot in which students
can park all day.

Realistically, however, the problem is even
worse than it seems. A student living off-campus
scarcely has a chance at the corral because it stays
filled with the students’ cars who live in that area.
This is also true of the lot behind the gym.

This incident is a clear example of the univer-
sity’s misplaced priorities. In the administration’s
mind, the university’s image is more important
than the students’ happiness, and I don’t think that
the students will let this negligence go on forever.
This new development in the parking problem, the
ground-breaking of the fine arts center, and the at-
tempt to widen the diversity of the student body,
are all products of the image problem within the
university. It will be wonderful to have a new
theater on campus and it’s great that we are at-
tracting the ‘‘better students’’ that the university
wants to have, but the problems of the students
who are already at W&L should have precedence
over any other concern of the administration.
Otherwise, the Hill better prepare itself for an all-
out revolt with respect to parking. Threatening the
university’s self image in this way may be the only

LETTERS

way the students can get through to them.
DAVID ALLEN °90

To the Editors:
It has come to our attention, not for the first

‘time, that someone of below average intelligence

may be running this university. If recollection
serves us properly, the biggest controversy at the
opening of this school year concerned parking, or,
more accurately, lack thereof. The change of all
spaces on Washington Street to hour parking and a
new university policy of extremely limited park-
ing in ‘‘the corral,’’ coupled with the ever-
increasing student population at W&L, created the
classic problem of too many trying to fit into too
few, Now the administration has seen fit to take a

section of ‘‘the corral’’ that can normally accorm-
modate four or five cars and mark it for ‘‘ Visitor
Parking Only,’ specifically three visitors’ park-
ing only. What are these supposed wise men in
our administration thinking? Why are they aggra-
vating a situation that is already volatile? It seems
to us that the administration might take some of
the nine million plus dollars being spent on a
theater department that is hardly overpopulated
with students and spend that money on something
we could all use, more parking. In fact, there is
probably enough money in the university coffers
from the security department’s overzealous enfor-
cement of the ridiculous parking situation to
finance a multi-level parking complex. Finally, if
the university needs three parking complex. Final-
ly, if the university needs three parking places for
visitors, why not take them from the faculty lot
behind Graham-Lees Dorm and the C-school
where there are usually extra open parking
spaces. Besides, wouldn’t those spaces be more
convenient to visitors because of their proximity

I would like to take this opportunity to thank the
members of Alpha Phi Omega and the Newman
Club for their efforts last Friday evening in col-
lecting food for the Community Share Project in
Buena Vista. Over $150 worth of canned and
boxed goods were received, as well as almost $60
in cash donations.

This food will be distributed in Thanksgiving
boxes later this month, and will go a long way
toward giving some of the poor and needy in our
community a lot to be thankful for. We are ail
grateful for the volunteers who helped make this

‘‘Alternate Futures for Africa’’
panel holds symposium at W&L

By Jon Ryan
Staff Reporter

 

A struggle for national unity amid
ethnic factionalism is what Africa can
expect in the future, according to
members of the ‘‘Alternate Futures
for Africa’’ symposium panel.

The symposium was held last
Thursday in Northen Auditorium. The
symposium panel was comprised of
W&L Professor of Politics Craig
McCaughrin, Grand Duke Mengesha
Seun of the Ethiopian royal house and
two former U.S. ambassadors to Afri-
can nations, Walter Carrington and
Frederick Hasdel.

According to Carrington, the strug-

gle of unity overwhelms any consider-
ations of ideology.

‘The prevailing ‘ism’ in Africa is
not capitalism or communism, but
nationalism,’” he said.

Carrington spoke on the fact that
Africa’s problems of unity stem from
the fact that European colonizers split
the continent up without regard to the
established kingdoms. The result is
present-day nations comprised of
several ethnic groups, with ethnic
rivalries.

Carrington said national leaders in
Africa have to create a sense of unity,
making nationalism the greatest force
for political stability on the continent.

Carrington gave the example of

Angola, whose ethnic groups split into
three parties fighting for control of the
government.

Hasdel said, ‘‘Unity is a precious
commodity at best.’’

According to Hasdel, part of Afri-
ca’s problems were caused by the
“‘battle-by-proxy’’ policies of the
United States and the Soviet Union, in
which the two superpowers support
factions of the appropriate ideology in
struggles for power inside nations.

Hasdel said he saw the U.S. posi-
tion as one of continuity for the next
few years.

**The new administration is likely to
be more of the same."’

Cans stack up to feed poor

by Becky Reynolds
Staff Reporter

 

Service organizations from Vir-
ginia Military Institute, Washington
and Lee and the W&L law school col-
lected $150 worth of food and $50 in
cash in a Thanksgiving food drive
held last Friday, according to Catholic
Campus Minister William C. ‘*Burr’’
Datz.

Newman Club, a service and prayer
organization of university students
from St. Patrick’s Catholic Church
and Alpha Phi Omega, a Washington

and Lee service fraternity, co-spon-
sored the food drive, which was -held
from 4 to 6 p.m. Friday, Nov. 10.

According to Datz, more than 20
students from VMI, W&L and the law
school were on hand at the Lexington
Market and Kroger in Lexington, and
the Quality Market and Food Lion in
Buena Vista to collect boxed and
canned food from shoppers.

Datz said, ‘‘People were tremen-
dously cooperative and the response
from the community was overwhelm-
ing. We were only there for two hours
and we collected a lot.”’

The food was donated to the Com-
munity Share Project in Buena Vista

and, according to Irma Thompson, di-
rector of the Community Share
Project, will be used in Thanksgiving
food baskets next week.

Thompson said, ‘‘We are very ap-
preciative that they (the service organ-
izations) had the food drive because it
will help us with the food baskets.
Without the donated food, we would
have to buy most of the food for the
baskets because we have not been get-
ting too many donations.”’

According to Thompson, 12 fami-
lies will receive food baskets from
Community Share for next week's
holiday.

 

Car tax

 

(continued from page 1)

‘*Because we're so small and have
no possibility of growing,’’ said King,
“the city is going to be looking for

opportunities like this for increased
revenue.””

King said Lexington could perhaps
raise as much as $250,000 annually
through a tax on student vehicles,
thanks to a 5.5 percent personal prop-
erty tax rate in Virginia.

The legal thinking behind a student

vehicle tax is spelled out in state law.
According to King, if a vehicle is
‘*primarily parked or garaged’’ any-
where in Virginia, then the local
government has the right to tax the
owner of it, regardless of whether the
owner is a state resident.

When asked how the tax would be
levied, King said VMI and W&L
would probably be asked to provide
the city with a list of students who
own cars.

And what if school officials refused
to turn over such a list?

‘| think it would be embarrassing
for them to refuse,’’ he said.

But, if schools refused to cooperate,

King said the city could take down li-
cense plates, identify owners and send
them bills.

“‘If it came down to that, I’m not
sure the university could block the
city,’” he said.

But according to W&L’s acting
president, John Elrod, the university
hasn’t even discussed the possibility
of a student vehicle tax with Lexing-
ton officials.

While W&L ‘‘does have a policy of
restricting the list of students,’’ Elrod
said that ‘‘whether we would make
such a list available to the city is a
question we have not addressed.’’

Fort Lee weekend trained
cadets in marksmanship

._ by Robert Haley

Staff Reporter

 

More than 100 cadets from Wash-
ington and Lee and three other affi-
liated schools participated in the an-
nual fall Field Training Exercise
(FTX) at Fort Lee, Va. The purpose
of the exercise was to train third-year
cadets for the ROTC advanced camp
they will attend this summer, and to
expose freshman and sophomore par-
ticipants to Army tactis, training and
barracks life.

The cadets left their respective uni-
versities on Friday, Nov. 11, and ar-
rived at Fort Lee that night. There
they received their initial block of in-

structions from senior cadets on bar-'

racks life and basic Drill and Cere-
mony. The next morning, cadets con-
ducted physical training and indivi-
dual tactics. This training included
camouflage and individual movement
techniques, which included high
crawl, low crawl, 3-5-second rushes,
and a demanding obstacle course.

“‘Obstacle courses require team-
work, physical strength, and stamina,
and they also provide an exciting chal-
lenge,’’ said one cadet.

The afternoon activities included

squad movement techniques, crossing
danger areas, reaction to artillery fire,
and hand and arm signals. All of these
classes taught the cadets how to react,
survive and destroy the enemy in a
combat situation.

On Sunday, the cadets were intro-
duced to the M-16 rifle. Each cadet
learned Basic Rifle Marksmanship
and was permitted to fire on the Zero
Range in order to adjust the sights on
Field Fire Range, with multiple tar-
gets ranging from 50-300 meters.
Cadets received their scores after fir-
ing.

The weekend was fun and involved
for everyone. Captain Ramos, an offi-
cer from Washington and Lee, said,
‘*The freshmen and sophomores who
participated on the exercise area were
enthusiastic about the program and en-
joyed their weekend.”’

Those who participated learned
about many different facets of the
U.S. Army, as well as making friend-
ships with fellow squad and platoon
members. Lieutenant Colonel Snow,
professor of military science at Wash-
ington and Lee, deemed the weekend
a success, saying, ‘‘All cadets were
highly motivated during training and
this is what it takes to be a United
States Army officer.’’

 

 

Goods sell

fast at W&L
open auction

by Tina Vandersteel
Staff Reporter

 

 

More than $6,000 worth of de-
partmental furniture and relics were
sold this past weekend at an auction
held by University Services.

Fontanne Bostic, who works for
University Services, said that every-
thing was sold in three hours, starting
at 10 a.m., and she said the money
earned on each item was given back to
the department that donated it. She
said about 90 bidders showed up to 4
buy, and the auction went smoothly.

Bostic also said University services
is planning to hold other auctions
periodically to clear our storerooms
full of obsolete departmental furnish-
ings. She said that departments should
contact her office to reserve space in
storerooms for future auctions,

Other W&L staff who donated their
time Saturday morning for the auction
include: Charlie Conner, Agnes Gil-
more, David Weeks, Kenneth Swink,
Tony Muterspaw and William Moh-
ler.

Defense sparkles
in football victory

‘Streaking Generals end 5-3-1

 

‘*By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

The bend-but-don't-break-defense
that has been the trademark of W&L
football for nearly a month compen-
sated for a slow-starting offense, and
junior quarterback Phillip Sampson
came back from early turnover trou-
bles to throw for over 200 yards and
lead the Generals (5-3-1) to a season-

,ending 17-13 win over Washington
University Saturday in St. Louis.

Like the game the week before
against Ursinus, this one was a mud-
bath — only worse.

“Tt was a sea of mud from sideline
to sideline,’’ said head coach Gary
Fallon. ‘I thought there would be

reven more turnovers than there
were.”’

But Sampson probably thought his

+three first-half turnovers— two fum-
bles and an interception — were more
“than enough. The W&L defense was
¢yet again called on to cover for the
offense— and the defense yet again re-
* sponded.
+ After the game opened with an
exchange of punts, the Sampson-led
*Generals drove to the Washington 1,
,where Sampson fumbled and the
Bears’ Ben Hess recovered. But the
»defense held, and Sampson and com-
,pany got another chance.

Starting at the WU 33, the Generals
‘moved the football to the 11, where a
Sampson pass was intercepted by the
Bears’ Rod Shelton. But the defense

‘eheld, and Sampson and company got
another chance.

Starting at the WU 44, the Generals
snoved the football to the 2, where ....
no, this time, they cashed in. Senior
‘halfback Tony Waskiewicz powered
,into the end zone and sophomore Car-
ter Quayle added the extra point that
‘gave the Generals a 7-0 lead with 6:44
Jeft in the half.

After a Bear fumble, a Sampson
‘fumble and a Bear punt, the Generals
fook over at their own 12 with 3:32
remaining. Backup QB Chris Smythe
tame in, and Fallon shifted to a
ground-based offense. Four straight
rushing plays — including two
10-yard-plus ‘carries’ by Smythe —
moved the football to the W&L 38.
But a false start penalty and an incom-
‘plete pass stalled the drive, and time
ran out after a 10-yard carry by Was-
kiewicz.

Wrestlers look to rebound a

Both teams did a better job of hold-
ing on to the football in the third quar-
ter, but only the Generals took advan-
tage. Sampson built a_ 10-play,
52-yard scoring drive with passes to
Craig Irons. The sophomore split end
pulled in five catches for 69 yards on
that drive alone (the Generals were hit
with two ten-yard penalties), includ-
ing a 13-yard catch that put W&L at
the Washington 2. Waskiewicz scored
a play later, and Quayle’s kick put the
Generals up by 14.

The fourth quarter saw the W&L
defense bend badly — but not break.
Washington scored less than a minute
into the period on a 22-yard pass from
Robert King to running back Pad
Boyle, and Jeff Chrusciel’s kick made
the score 14-7.

After a Tom Skeen punt, King was
intercepted by senior defensive end
Tony Onorato at the WU 12, and that
set up a 28-yard field goal by Quayle
that gave the Generals a 10-point lead
with ten minutes remaining.

The Bears would cut that lead to
four by driving 84 yards in 13 plays
and scoring on a 9-yard pass from
King to Bob Lavender. Washington
went for the two-point conversion in
an effort to set up a winning field goal,
but King’s pass was incomplete, and
the Bears would need a touchdown to
win.

W&L tried to run out the clock but
was forced to punt with :27 left.
Skeen’s kick sent Washington back to
it’s own 20, though, and, three plays
later, the clock ran out and W&L had
its first winning season in three years.

HASHMARKS— W&L finished
with wins in five of its last six games
and was 5-1-1 in its last seven. It was
the Generals’ first winning season
since 1985, when W&L was 7-2....
The Bears netted only 33 yards of
offense in the first half.... Junior line-
backer Mike Pack made nine tackles
Saturday; Skeen, W&L’s other start-
ing linebacker, had six stops.... Fal-
lon is 8-3 in season finales at W&L....
Quayle’s field goal was his tenth of

‘the season (he already Wns the school

record). Quayle finished the season
10-of-12 in field goal attempts and
perfect on 14 PATs.... Sampson com-
pleted 18 of 23 passes for 207 yards
against the Bears. Irons caught eight
passes for 108 yards, and Waskiewicz
caught five for 64 yards. ;

Senior Lee Brading’s passing, as well as scoring, will key W&L’s success.

Basketball tips off season Friday

 

By Jay Plotkin
Staff Reporter

 

Head coach Verne Canfield is entering his 25th season
as coach of the men’s basketball team here at Washington
and Lee. This year he has a special gleam in his eye when
he talks about his team.

“T like the kind of young men in the prograrfi this
year,’’ he said. ‘‘They are a joy to teach and to be
around. They have teachable attitudes and listen to in
struction. That doesn’t mean they do everything I say. |
expect mistakes from them. This is one of the best groups
of young men I’ve seen in my 25 years of coaching.”’

Why does Canfield expect mistakes from the 1988-89
edition of Generals’ basketball? One reason could be the
fact that of the 17 members of the team, 15 are either
freshmen or sophomores. The only two players who
don’t fall into this category are senior guard Lee Brading
and junior center Del Clark. Brading, a 6-3 Rex Chap-
man look-alike, didn’t play during his junior year but
started in 12 games as a sophomore. The team also re-
turns 10 lettermen.

With the preseason over and the season starting with
the W&L Tip-Off Tournament Friday night in the War
ner Center, Canfield said the team will try to generate its
scoring from the defense. ‘“We’ll use a multiple defense
system—several different sets and variations of them. We
want to score a lot from defense and free-throw situa
tions.””

Canfield said the team is also relying on the three-point
shot to provide most of the offense. ‘‘We’re going to
shoot the bejabbers out of the three-pointer. We have that
capability. We, have to realize though, that when they
aren’t falling, we have to-stop. shooting them. We also
have to hold on to the ball and work for a good shot. So
far we haven't shown that patience. ”’

The team can go nine or ten players deep without suf

fering a significant drop in talent. According to Canfield, .

there are five to seven players capable of scoring in
double figures with two freshmen lurking around the

of the gan
the game. It’s who’s in when the game in on the line that I

vo by

this team has

corner waiting to show what they can do. ‘*The ideal si-
tuation would be for our leading scorer to average 15 or

16 points a game, and the next guy to be around 13 or 14.

1 would like six players in or around double figures.””

And don’t assume that the five players that Canfield

starts will be the same five he has on the floor at the end

‘I’m not real concerned with who is starting

‘For instance. right now, in a tight situation, I would

want both [sophomore Jim] Casey and [sophomore Mi-
chael]Holton in the game [at the guard positions] along
with Brading. Right now, only one of the two, Casey or
Holton, will start because of what I’m trying to do with
our big men,” said Canfield.

As for who will shoulder the scoring burden, the lead-

ing returning scorer is 6-5 forward Ed Hart. The sopho-
more averaged 14 a game last season along with 6.5 re-
bounds. Brading also averaged in double figures at 10.3
his sophomore year. Look for he and Holton to have the
green light when it comes to the three- point shot. Holton
should provide a spark on defense as well. He led the
team in steals last year. Sophomore forward Chris Jacobs
will be a key player on the frontline. Jacobs came on
strong in the latter stages of last year, averaging 8.5
points a game for the season.

Canfield is the type of coach who doesn’t like to dwell

on weaknesses, but he said maturity is the one weakness

albeit a temporary one.

“When you get a team who accepts their roles, then
you've gota nucleus,”’ he said. ‘*We’re not there yet, but
we will be soon.”’

Canfield also thinks the Generals will make a serious
challenge for the Old Deminion Athletic Conference ti-
tle. “Il see a tremendotisly balanced league this year, but
{ think we can make a run for the championship. I am
very excited about the potential of this team.”’

The Generals play Gallaudet Friday night at 8 in the
Warner Center. The winner of that game will play the
winner of the 6 p.m. Marymount/N.C. Wesleyan game
in the championship on Saturday at 4 p.m.

 

 

seniors Manoli Loupassi and Mark
Robertson],’” said Franke. ‘‘[Senior]
Richard Redfoot didn’t wrestle last
year, but now he’s back. We expect a
lot from them.

Right now, the lineup begins at 126

key, last year’s outstanding freshman
wrestler. Next comes junior Jonah
Glick 134; then junior Lee Garlove,
who was an Academic all-American

From Staff Reports

 

The Washington and Lee men’s
and women’s cross country teams
finished their 1988 seasons at the
NCAA Division III
South/Southeast Regionals in Se-
wanee, Tenn., with some of their
best individual performances of the
year.

While none of the Generals were
able to advance to nationals, senior
Bill Clark and freshman Charles
Edwards of the men’s team and
sophomores Paige Cason and Ce-
cily Tynan and freshman Jenny
Nasser of the women’s team turned
in admirable performances.

The men’s team finished ninth in
field featuring runners from 17
teams—-the biggest field in the his-
tory of the regional. W&L's Ed-
wards grabbed 30th place, while
senior co- captain Clark finished
33rd.

The W&L women took sixth
place in a field containing runners

’ from 13 teams. Cason came in
23rd overall with a time of 21:54,
while Tynan was close behind, fin-
ishing 25th overall in a time of
21:57. Freshman Nasser had her
best meet ever, finishing 36th with
a time of 23:42.

The Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference made its all-conference
selections in football, soccer and
women’s volleyball this week.

Water polo
finishes 8th
in the East

By Tom Wingfield
Staff Reporter

 

This past weekend's trip to Brown
University for the Eastern Champion-
ships did not go as Washington and
Lee’s water polo team had hoped. In
fact, it went very poorly for the Gen-
erals who lost all three of the games
they played. It was a bad ending to a
good season for the Generals, who fin-
ished eighth in the East with a 15-9 re-
cord.

The Generals opened the tourna-
ment against their nemesis, the Uni-
versity of Arkansas-Little Rock. The
Trojans had defeated W&L twice ear-
lier this year, including just a week
before in the Southern League Cham-
pionship game and were looking to
make it a hat trick against the Gen-
erals.

W&L kept the game close but came
up on the short end of a 16-12 score.
The Trojans proved to be a better team
as they out- muscled and out-played
the Generals. ‘‘We played well
against Arkansas but it was just not
quality Washington and Lee water
polo,’’ said head coach Page Remil-
lard. ‘By not beating them we came
up short of season-long goals.”’

After the opening round loss, the
Generals had to play consolation
games against Army and Harvard.
W&L could not rise to the occasion
after the loss to Arkansas, however,
losing to Army 12-5 and dropping
12-7 decision to Harvard. These los-
ses seemed to upset Remillard the
most.

“I was very disappointed in our
inability to bounce back after a serious
setback,’’ he said, ‘*Part of this was
due to our success for most of the
season but a good team must be able to
handle these setbacks. It will up to the
our underclassmen to learn from this
and to make sure it doesn’t happen
again.”’

Senior David Reavy was not pleased
with the weekend either. ‘‘We didn’t
play as a team and that really hurt us.
After the Arkansas game it was hard
to get motivated for the other two. It
was definitely a disappointing way to
end a four-year career.”’

The Generals will lose some of their
fire power when senior co-captains
Reavy and David Dietz graduate.
‘*Losing those two guys will hurt us,
but we will also lose Matt Brady and
Tom Rawls who both played very well
this year,’’ said Remillard.

For the football Generals, senior
linebacker Tom Skeen, senior de-
fensive end Jim Johnson, and
sophomore kicker Carter Quayle
were named to the all-conference
first team at their respective posi-
tions,

Named to the second team for
the Generals were senior offensive
linemen David Surface and Julian
Phillips, junior tight end Bob Mar-
tin, sophomore wide receiver
Craig Irons and junior defensive
backs Bobby Rimmer and Bland
Warren. Skeen was named to the
second team as a punter.

W&L head football coach Gary
Fallon received the top honor as he
was selected by his peers as ODAC
Coach-of-the-Year for leading his
team to a 5-3-1 record after an
0-2-1 start.

For the men’s soccer team,
senior back Steve ‘‘Sid’’ Udicious
and junior forward Patrick Brown
were both named to the conferen-
ce's first team. Senior Vanessa
Hartman garnered first team all-
ODAC honors in women's volley-
ball.

 

The W&L men's swim team
opened up its season last night with
an impressive 148-79 victory over
host VMI. The women's swim
team plays host to ODAC rivals
Mary Baldwin, Randolph-Macon
Woman's College, Sweet Briar and
Hollins this weekend in the W&L
Invitational.

~ nta;  °  "

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

One has to wonder at what point Hollywood will quit commercia-
lizing the Vietnam War. I mean it’s no secret that for years Holly-
wood has been notorious for taking a successful film idea and then
turning out dozens of bastardations to turn a profit by pulling in
viewers from the original success. After all, Gremlins (not an all
together pleasant film) did spurn such classics as Ghoulies and Crit-
terswhich, though it wasn’t that difficult a task, were far worse than
their predecessor.

Stull, I suppose if you examine film history, commercialization,
especially in the case of war, has been happening since the film in-
dustry exploded in the 1930s. As for war films, let’s face it- John
Wayne alone kept the WW II film industry in business. (It should be
noted, however, that many of the Duke’s war films are American
classics, unlike the mindless wastes of celluloid previously mention-
ted.

So, I guess the question at hand is how long will Hollywood con-
tinue to bring back the nightmarish memories of Vietnam that
America either never knew or tried to forget.? The answer is- as
long as there is a film idea and money to support it. As long as
Americans continue laying down $4, $5 and even $6 to watch Stal-
lone kill commies for cash and continue to support films likeDeath
before Dishonor, then producers will continue to back these worth-
less, insulting films.

\ wish that the industry would quit producing films about Viet-
nam that are nothing but insulting to the men who fought there. Our
veterans are real and they do see. They do absorb what is going on
around them. Many still think that America hates them for doing

Two weekends ago in Washington, I interviewed a homeless man
in Lafayette Park across from the White House who is a Vietnam
Veteran and who sleeps in and eats out of trashcans. Part of his
commentary to me was: ‘‘We came home and the government said
here, take this drug, take these valium and you'll feet better but,
how can they teach you how to love after you've killed so
long?... You can’t do it man. No one ever said coming home from
Vietnam would be easy, but no one said, hey, love you. They all
said, ‘you were wrong man, you were wrong...Hey, sorry about
what you did.’ Sorry’s too late.’’

If Hollywood is so concerned with presenting a quality film about
the effects of Vietnam and about what happened then it should do so
and quit turning out sequel after sequel of contrived garbage that
never and could never have happened. It’s absolutely abusurd and
infuriating. Stallone was in Sweden during Vietnam, I wonder
why? Oh, and how about another one- Springsteen singing ‘‘Born in
the U.S.A.”’ after dodging the draft. Where is the justice here?

Please do not get me wrong. I am not blasting every Vietnam film
that has ever been released. Many such as Platoon, Full Metal
Jacket, Hamburger Hill and the film I am reviewing today, Bat 2]
are excellent. But please let’s put an end to this sickening displays
of commercialization and make a serious statement about getting
quality films. Remember, the road begins at the studios, but it ends
at your wallet.

Hackman
and Glover

excellent
in Bat 21

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

Every now and then a film comes
along that sets itself apart from the
mainstream and makes a_ serious
statement. Every now and then direc-
tor, actor and cinematographer put
together a film that makes a difference
and says something new. Every now
and then a film is truly worthy of be-
ing seen and discussed. Bat 2/ is such
a film.

The film is the true story of
Col.Iceal Hambleton, an elestronic
specialist and high ranking colonel
who was shot down over Vietnam and
saw for the first time in his military
career just what combat was like. Us-
ing golf terminology to throw off the
Vietnamese (the Vietnamese had
never been introduced to golf) he dis-
closed his position to
Cap.Bartholomew Clark, callsign
‘‘Birddog,’’who tracked him in his
recon plane and helped him reach
“‘the clubhouse. ”’

As always, Gene Hackman and
Danny Glover are superb. As Hamble-
ton and Clark, they give the film the
emotion and believability it needs to
succeed. Unlike most Vietnam films
though, it has an inherent feel with
scene after scene for support that say
it doesn’t have to succeed, it just does.

There is one scene where Hackman
must kill a farmer and then another
where he meets a little Vietnamese
boy on a bridge where Hackman lets
the little boy pass unharmed. As
Hackman approaches a springed trap
at the end of the bridge, the Viet-
namese boy runs back and trips it for
him and saves his life. Hackman gives
the boy something and the boy in turn
gives Hackman his hat. It is in these
scenes that one can see the character
of Hambleton realize how futile and
terrible the Vietnam War really is.
Hambleton sees then for the first time
that the Vietnamese were people just
like us and that the war is nothing but
a waste.

Bat 21 starts off like just another
war film, but quickly turns into one of
the better films of the year. Enough
cannot be said for Hackman’s and
Glover’s performances. Hackman is
as good as he was in The French Con-
nection for which he won a Best Actor
oscar and gives probably his best per-
formance since then. Glover proves
again that he is the finest young black
actor working today. Anything of his
is good from his first film to this one.
Even Jerry Reed, (of Smokey and the
Bandit fame) who produced this film,
puts in a very solid performance as
Glover’s superior officer.

Put Bat 21] on your list of films to
see over Thanksgiving break. It’s an
excellent piece of work and thanks to
the incredible cinematography, a
beautiful film to watch.

out is totally false.

 

R.E.M. fans have something to smile about this fall. The
band has two new releases out. Eponymous, a greatest hits
album, was released by I.R.S. and Green, their latest re-

The first single off of Green is ‘‘Orange Crush,"
terestingtune that has Michael Stipe telling us ‘
my spine, I’ve got my orange cruch.*’
ble, it will probably do well of the pop charts. But even if
the song is a musical success on the disgusting pop scene,
it will make some smile to see a tune written about an un-
fortunate Vietnam killer, Agent Orange, on the charts at
all. Yes, this album is more accessible than others pre-
viously released. Perhaps STipe and the rest of the band
realize this as the title of the first song is *‘Pop Song ‘89."’

The band’s sound is very tight throughout the entire re-
cord. Peter Buck still prefers a ringing guitar chord to a
blistering lead. Bill Berry and Mike Mills provide solid
rhythm but nothing exceptional. Stipe, however, as a lyri-
cist and singer has grown up. His voice is no longer muf-
fled at all and the lyrics are not as obtuse and difficult as

Immediately likea-

But as for all this talk of selling out, that’s undeniably
wrong. The band certainly changed since the release
ofChronic Town but they are still progressive. It is true
that their music crosses over into pop but to say they sold

The band has branched out incorporating mandolin

an in-
‘I’ve got

 

playing in ‘‘You Are the Everything.’’ The song starts out
with the sound of crickets recorded outside of their studio
in New York. Accompanied by organ, piano and mando-
lin, Stipe sings a haunting and catchy ballad.

On “‘Stand”’ Peter Buck does the unheard of and plays a
lead. Nothing blistering or inspiring but something that
fits well with the song and demonstrates that his playing
has moved up slightly.

 

 

Another unheard of occurs on this record as well;
R.E.M. printed the actual lyrics to the song ‘*World
Leader Pretend.’’ The song encompasses the band’s
world peace and understanding ideology. It is no coinci-
dence that this album was released on November 8 and it .
is true that Stipe was a volunteer for the Dukakis cam-
“| paign. The song is well-written, played and will have you
dancing and thinking at the the same time.

R.E.M. turns up the distortion for ‘‘Turn You Inside
Out”’ and it works. It rocks only the way an R.E.M. song
can. Then it’s back to the mandolin for ‘*The Wrong
, .| Child;’’ a song that one can only guess tells the story of a
child that cannot communicate with the rest of the world,
or is not allowed to. Another haunting tune that hooks in
4 the listener.

The album lists only ten songs but there is an eleventh
track that is unnamed. Several songs recorded did not
make the album and probably will be on the ‘‘B’’ sides of
singles released.

Just where does this album stand among the R.E.M.
albums? T’ll leave that to your preference. If you do de-
cide to fork over the ridiculous amount that record stores
charge for recordings you won’t be disappointed and
might even be pleased at what you hear.

Washington and Lee University has
received a $250,000 gift from Edwin
A. Morris, a 1926 graduate of Wash-
ington and Lee from Greensboro,
N.C.

The gift will be divided between
two programs. An honor scholarship
will be established at Washington and
Lee, endowed at $150,000, for wor-
thy and achieving students of fine
character from the state of North Car-
olina. The remaining $100,000 is to
be used to enrich the economics pro-
gram at Washington and Lee, through
endowment in Morris’ name, in the
areas of guest lectures, materials, li-
brary acquisitions, travel, and the
overall enhancement of the teaching
program.

‘Mr. Morris’ generous gift will
enable the economics department to
enrich the curriculum, strengthen fa-
culty development efforts, and expand
research activity,’ said Larry Pep-
pers, dean of the School of Com-
merce, Economics, and Politics at
Washington and Lee. ‘* We are indeb-
ted to Mr. Morris for his support of
our academic program.”’

Morris entered Washington and Lee
from Concord, N.C. He is a member
of Omicron Delta Kappa, the national
leadership fraternity founded at Wash-
ington and Lee, and a member of the
Sigma Chi social fraternity. He
received an honorary doctor of laws
degree from Washington and Lee in
1980. He attended the Harvard Busi-
ness School.

and the first and second place winners
of the contest will open for the two
headline bands on Saturday night.

Contact will be made with all poten-
tial dancers, including students at the
five surrounding women’s colleges,
before Christmas break, Bostic said.
‘‘We need to make contact before
Christmas so people can get their
pledges over the holidays,”’ she said.

Bostic said several of the weekend
prizes have already been confirmed,
including a weekend at Greenbrier
and a weekend at the Williamsburg
Hilton. These prizes, which are do-
nated, will be given to dancers who
bring in the most pledges and money
at February’s dance.

Bostic said the Superdance commit-
tee is still working out the details for
the grand prize, which they hope will
be a 4-day weekend in Fort Lauder-
dale, Florida, over spring break. ‘“We
normally have to pay a portion of the
grand prize. If the Lauderdale week-
end works out, we will probably have
to pay air fare but the hotel accom-
modation will be donated,’’ Bostic
said.

A couple of fund raisers for the
Superdance are also in the works,
Bostic said. A bowl-a-thon was held

Superdance is set

Tuesday, and the committee is work-
ing on a Casino 21 night, a night
of gambling for those who are 21 or
older, for sometime in January.

Bostic said, ‘‘We don’t make a
whole lot of money on these fund
raisers. They are mostly used for
promoting the actual dance.

In the past, the Superdance commit-
tee has held slave auctions at the sur-
rounding women’s colleges as fund
raisers but are not going to do that this
year. According to Bostic, the auc-
tions are good publicity but the money
is difficult to collect. She said last year
they had $4,000 in pledges at the slave
auctions but only collected $500 be-
cause people do not pay their pledges
or do not take it seriously. She also
said that several of the women’ col-
leges do not like the auctions.

“We are going to use a different
avenue of publicity at the women’s
colleges this year. We hope our rep-
resentatives at these schools will get
more involved and decide on promo-
tions for their schools,’ Bostic said.

Bostic said there are no figures yet
as to the number of dancers who will
be participating but they are hoping

Homeless shelter operating again

 

By Jim Johnson
Staff Reporter

 

As the freezing winter months des-
cend on Lexington, Gladys Steele
prepares to deal with the problem of
sheltering the homeless.

Steele is the manager and owner of
the Gladys House Shelter for the
Homeless, which she runs in her home
on Varner Lane, under the Nelson
Street bridge. She has been taking the
homeless into her house for almost 20
years. The shelter itself was opened
three years ago.

The shelter operates officially only
during the winter months, beginning
Nov. 1. Funding and volunteer help
for running the shelter comes from
area churches and civic groups who

provide meals and supervision, These

groups volunteer on a weekly basis,

providing meals for an average of 4-5
shelter guests per night.

According to Mac Crawford, com-
mittee chairman and volunteer coor-
dinator for the shelter, additional vol-
unteer help comes from the W&L
community, with undergraduates, law
students and faculty contributing their
time and efforts. He said the shelter
committee “‘really appreciates all that
the W&L community has done.”’

During the summer months, when
the Gladys House is not officially
open, Steele supports operations with
her widow's pension from the Vet
erans’ Administration.

While most people seeking aid from
the Gladys House are from the Lex

ington area, transient homeless, such
as people travelling on the highway,
usually contact the Lexington Police
Department for aid. According to
Lexington City Manager Joseph King,
the police refer these homeless to the
Rockbridge Area Relief Association
and the Salvation Army. These organ
izations provide cash, shelter and food
to those who demonstrate need

King said currently there is not
much of a homeless problem in Lex
ington, During the winter months, he
said, police will check under bridges
and in other areas frequented by the
homeless to make sure anyone who
needs help can get it. ‘* When you look
at Lexington and Washington, D.C
he said, **

of scale.”’

there is no real comparison

According to one shelter committee
member, however, national predic
tions are that the homeless situation
will worsen. In anticipation of this,
the committee has cleared a lot given
to the shelter on Moore Street, and has
begun discussing construction of a
new shelter. Lack of funding and op
position to the construction have put
the plans on the back burner for the
time being

Steele said people who want to do
nate food, clothing or funds in the
warm weather months must give the
items to her personally

In the meantime Gladys Steele and
local volunteers will continue to pro

OPINION

 

Give Athletes
Some Credit

Ah, yes, the W&L athlete — the overworked, underpaid W&L

athlete.

This brings a question to mind — why does the University give
only two Physical Education credits to an intercollegiate varsity ath-
lete who participates in a sport for four years?

It seems unfair that an athlete devotes at least two hours every
day, (along with pre-season, off-season, and sacrificing vacation
time) during his/her season for four years, yet must take three more
P.E. courses before his/her P.E. requirement is met.

The University is benefitting from an athlete’s participation in
sports, right? Then why isn’t the University giving credit where

credit is due (pun intended)?

An athlete would still be required to take one other P.E. course if
he/she received credit for all four years of his/her effort.

Does the University actually think an athlete will benefit in some
way from taking those three more P.E. courses? Perhaps the athlete
would become moré well-rounded. He/she wouldn’t have a concen-
tration in one single area. After all, W&L is a liberal arts college.

But does liberal arts include P.E.?

Some may say it is the athlete’s choice to give up his/her time for
a sport. It’s an extracurricular activity. Wait a minute. Isn’t chorus
an extracurricular activity? Don’t the students who voluntarily sa-
crifice one hour a day at least two times a week to chorus get one
credit hour for every semester they participate?

‘*A”’ for effort? It doesn’t seem that the athletes are getting any-
thing for their effort, accept maybe sore muscles and hopefully a
P.E. course enrollment card from Coach Dick Miller. If they want

anything more they’ Il have to sing.

Lessons from the past

 

MY VIEW
By Scott Richardson

 

Ah, November. The holidays be-
gan as we spent Thanksgiving at home
with family and friends. It was a time
to be thankful, a time to reflect on
what is, and what might have been.
November is a time of change, and a
time for remembrance.

As our generation spent the holiday
watching’ television and enjoying the
advent of another endless NBA
season, our parents and the nation re-
membered, with glassy eyes, a day in
Dallas that forever changed their lives
and ours. I gave up flipping between
Monday Night Football and MTV to
watch several excellent documentaries
marking the 25th anniversary of the
passing of John F. Kennedy.

My parents, who never watch telev-
ision, became entranced as faces from
the administration told with compell-
ing emotion of the life and death of the
beloved president.

Extensive footage followed, tracing
the events leading to the assassination
and the horrific drama that unfolded
before the eyes of the entire nation and
the world. This was not the first presi-
dent to be shot or die, but the un-
precedented media coverage made it
into perhaps the most memorable day
of this century.

Funny huh? I never hear or read of
anyone remembering where they were
and what they were doing as World
War I and II ended or the stock market
crashed. Did Kennedy, the first telev-
ision president, really project such a

forceful, infallible image? How could
someone capture so completely the at-
tention of an entire nation? Maybe we
should ask ourselves this as Reagan
laughs out the remainder of his term.
The sound byte is more powerful than
the sword.

The Kennedy image shattered as the
nation realized that we are indeed a
violent society beset by crime and an
underworld. Do you think this was a
mob hit? Were there two, maybe even
three gunmen? It seems as if we will
never know the.truth.

“Time has'a fascinating effect on his-

Meet me in the library

tory and what is fact and what is fable.
Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Lee
and Franklin were all great men of
legendary proportions, but Kennedy?
Time, aided by the pale white glow of
T.V., has cast its golden glow on a
man who should perhaps be re-
membered for womanizing and war.

Why give Johnson the short end of
the stick? If Kennedy had lived, in
reality he never would have lived up
to his present legend. Reagan had to
fight to keep his presidency, but I'll
bet in 50 years he'll be remembered as
a great president. I knew I should have
taken acting lessons.

While the quality of this past elec-
tion left little to be thankful for - is it
possible to be marginally thankful?
I'm thankful for our democratic
processes despite their trappings.
Power changes hands extremely fast
in Washington, brutally so. But, this
transfer is a marvel we should all be
thankful for. It’s a pleasant paradox
that the most powerful position in the
world usually changes hands with no
bloodshed. The king is dead; long live
the king.

Merry Christmas!!!

MY VIEW
By C.Edward Klank

It has been quite a while since I have
made a contribution to this fine pub-
lication, and I feel that I will bring up
some issues that should be discussed.
As in the past, I will approach every
issue from an unbiased viewpoint.

Recently a sophomore brought to
my attention a story that not only sur-
prised me, but shook my Judeo-Chris-
tian values. This sophomore who wit-
nessed this startling event has asked to
remain anonymous. Of course, I could
tell you, but then I would have to kill
you. Jokes aside, this sophomore
(who from this point on I will refer to
as Saul Boil) was in the University Li-
brary- I forget which floor, the third
or fourth I believe, but I’m not overly
worried about the facts- trying to
study for a very important mid-term
examination. He took a break to run to
the little boys room. As he was return-
ing to his study carrel, he passed a
study room, from which he heard
some commotion. Saul looked into the
room through a window on the door,
and much to his surprise there were
two undergraduates, a representative

 

To the Editors:

 

 

On Wednesday evening November 16, two
WLUR disc jockeys aired uncomplimentary re-
marks concerning Washington and Lee women
and Trident. ‘‘Remarks broadcast with the ex-
pressed intent of ridiculing any individual or
group are a direct violation of established station
policy.”’ They should not be taken as a reflection

I regretted not finding more students in atten-
dance of the concert in Lee Chapel on Monday
night. I understand we all have a lot to do the last
two weeks of school, but please make the time to
go to university functions. The events in Lee
Chapel are generally of high caliber and serve as
an important part of the college experience. It’s
not that we don’t have legitimate time pressures-
we do, it’s just that the student representation at
such events reflects upon our school to quest per-
formers, lecturers, politicians, etc. which come
from all over the world. I shudder to think that

from both the major genders, rough-
housing in the room. After a closer
examination, Saul realized that these
two undergrads were carrying acts of
passion, procreating, slapping little
Johnny behind the ear, however you
would like to phrase it. Saul was
shocked into paralysis. The male half
of this cute couple looked up and no-
ticed Saul. Saul came to, and went to
find other people to laugh at these
clowns, but when Saul came back the
room had been straightened’ and va-
cated. Saul included more details
when he related this story to me, but
these acts committed by these two le-
chers are so profound and so disgust-
ing that proper decorum prevents me
from mentioning them in this dis-
cussion.

How does the student body react to
actions such as these? (This is a rhet-
orical question.) Two years ago, I
wrote an article in this same pub-
lication about the increasing incidents
of public displays of affection on
campus. They heard but did not listen.
Obviously, the problem has escalated
during the last two years. Actions
such as these present practical, as well
as moral problems for the entire stu-
dent body. First of all, grubbing in the
University Library may disrupt the
study patterns of others. I think it

Third World Hunger

 

MY VIEW
By Julia Kirk

 

Do you remember when you were a
child and your mother caught you hid-
ing your brussels sprouts under your
mashed potatoes? Chances are she
told you to eat them; there were chil-
dren starving in Ethiopia. As an intel-
ligent, curious child, you may have
asked what your brussels sprouts had
to do with starving Africans, or if you
did see a connection, you offered to
send your unwanted veggies to Ethio-
pia. After all, buying a clear cons-
cience with brussels sprouts was.-a
good deal, a truly cheap price. Send-
ing unwanted or surplus food to dis-
tressed nations is cheap, painless, and
in most cases terribly wrong.

Wheat sent to hungry nations serves
many purposes. First it feeds starving
people, until the supply runs out and
more must be sent. Secondly, it
undercuts the price of domestic pro-

duce and may put struggling tarmers
out of work, thereby adding to the
ranks of people dependent on the
government. Also, countries that suf-
fer long-term food shortages often be-
come dependent on_ internationat
hand-outs. Instead of developing via;
ble agri-systems they look to Live
Aid, Band Aid, and Bob Geldof to
save them. In short, by sending huge
quantities of food to countries like
Ethiopia we simply put off starvatior
temporarily, we do not stop it, and we
may even be perpetuating famine. *

Nations that cannot feed themselves
would benefit more from tractors, ad-
visors, and modern technology thant
they do from our surplus wheat. We.,,
the western world, tend to take the
easy way out of*d painful moral di-’
lemma - the disparities between our,
surplus and Third World need - by
sending food. The brussels sprouts we *
offered to send as children have,
changed into tons upon tons of wheat.
It is time we accepted the fact that we *
do more harm than good, and change ,
our alimentary policies.

would be hard to concentrate on an
academic subject if the entire floor
was shaking because two people were
unable to control their animal desires.
Also, it would be hard to remain seri-
ous about studying, if people were
making noises that sounded like a
couple of steers dying. I also believe
that most people would rather watch a
young man and woman make idiots of
themselves rather than study for a test.
In addition, these types of acts may
create messes that the custodial staff
of the library is not prepared to
handle. With the AIDS virus in mind,
unless the male carries around appara-
tuses the Surgeon General recom-
mends using in his wallet (which is
very redneck), the chances of spread-
ing this virus are increased. I do not
think the library should put in vending
machines to meet the needs of a few
individuals. However, there is a posi-
tive side to this incident. With the in-
creased number of male students
wearing earrings, weird clothes, such
as black leather pants, chemicals in

Washington and Lee might well be considered the
campus at which performances are attended pri-
marily by townspeople instead of students.
Unfortunately it was even more disappointing to
see the students that did attend. Talk about poor

representation!

ruined the performance.

Several guys were snoring; the girl across the
way was reading her library book; another few
guys were looking through a magazine; several
were passing notes; and one couple in particular
conversed incessantly throughout the second half
of the show. So obnoxious were they, most
everyone I saw after the show reported they

The two individuals have been discharged from
their positions at WLUR and will not be allowed
to participate in any station activities for the re-
mainder of their academic careers. Any such vio-
lations on the part of the station personnel have
been dealt with in a similar manner.

Impolite quartet audience annoys student |

On behalf of WLUR and the Journalism De-
partment I apologize to our audience in general
and the University community in particular.

The quartet did receive a standing ovation
which is an honor rarely given in a chapel - it &
would seem to indicated the general audience
thought they were great. Whether they were or
not is , of course, personal opinion; nonetheless,
it is appropriate to applaud at the end of a show. It
is inappropriate to run for the exit while perfor-
mers take their bows - as did most of the people in
the balcony. It seems to me such behavior might
be acceptable at Wilson Field; however, in the
chapel respect is due.

their hair, and hair down to their mid- ,
back, it is nice to see. an old-fashioned
heterosexual relationship, although in ‘
this case it was neither the time nor ,
place. ;
The question remains what to do if,
one confronts this type of situation.
The first rule is not to laugh out loud ’
in order not to disturb the lovely cou-
ple. Try to recruit as large a audience’
as possible- the more the merrier. -
When the time is right-I’ll leave it up
to the individual to determine when *
“the time is right’’- everybody run in ,
and shock the couple. If one is short of
money, blackmail the two for all they ‘
are worth. In this case, a camera ,
would help. If you do not need any
money, but are instead feeling bel- '
ligerent, ask the young lady to leave, :
and slap the guy around a little bit just
to make him feel like worthless dirt. If »
there are a group of guys, take his
clothes and let him run around in his *
birthday suit. The possibilities are ,
endless, just use your imagination.

Kato to give lecture

 

Staff Report

 

Rysozo Kato, an expert in Japanese
security and defense issues, will open
this year’s Telford Lecture Series at
Washington and Lee University on
Monday, Dec. 5.

Kato’s lecture, ‘U.S. - Japan Part-
nerships in the Pacific Age,’’ will be
presented at 8 p.m. in the University
Library’s Northern Auditorium and is
open to the public.

Since January 1987, Kato has ser-

Cats poisoned

By Betsy Griffin

The pets of two W&L seniors were
recently poisoned. The cause of death
is unknown, but it is believed that the
cats ate antifreeze, according to Dr.
Douglass Hopkins, a veterinarian at
the Blue Ridge Animal Clinic.

Dr. Hopkins said antifreeze is lethal
to cats since it only takes a teaspoon to
cause death. He said the substance
destroys a cat’s kidneys in only a few
days. W&L senior Christie Davis said
she noticed her cat was acting

Agreement.

Kato also spent two years in the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs at Yale
Law School and has subsequently held
posts in Tokyo, Washington, Austra-
lia, and Egypt, dealing with both pol-
itical and economic matters.

Each year the Telford Foundation

academic year has been organized by
the School of Commerce, Economics,

more lectures in the series, ‘“The U.S.
and Japan: Trading Places,’’ and
“‘NHK: Television News and Politics
in Japan,”’ are scheduled for January

day it had died.

Davis’ roommate, Melissa Anemo-
janis, said she noticed that her cat ac-
ted like Davis’. She said the vet put it
on a dialysis machine and it recovered
within a few days.

Dr. Hopkins said samples have been
sent to the state laboratory to deter-
mine what poisoned the cats.

Pet owners should be careful since
the antifreeze that leaks out of cars is
enough to kill a pet. Symptoms that
seem like a simple cold could be a
much more serious problem.

| Five sororities will give talks

 

By Eleanor Nelson
Staff Reporter

 

Starting the first week of the winter
term, undergraduate women at W&L
will begin the move toward colonizing
sororities.

On Jan. 4 five national sororities
(Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Kappa
Gamma, Pi Beta Phi, Chi Omega, and
Kappa Delta) will give presentations
to the students. These sororities were
chosen according to the interest indi-
cated on the surveys and according to
the interest and cooperation of the
national sororities.

At each presentation, women will
be able to leave comments on the three
sororities they would select. All pre
sentations will take place in Northern
Auditorium.

The following Sunday, Jan. 8 the
decision will be made on which sorori-
ties will colonize here.

In the second week of the term,
mandatory rush information sessions
will be held in Lee Chapel. Women
wanting to rush must attend either a
session on Wednesday or Friday in
Lee Chapel.

Tentatively, actual rush will begin
on Sunday, Jan 22, the fourth week of
the term. Open houses on Sunday will

 

as women’s rush begins

be followed by group interview ses-
sions and receptions on Monday and
Tuesday

Preference parties would take place
that Wednesday and women would be
invited back by certain sororities.
After these parties, women would turn
in their preference cards of what sor-
orities they want to join.

Bids would be given that Thursday.

All rush functions will be organized

and run by representatives of the
national sororities and their alumni.
Current members of sororities would

come only to assist in presentations
and open houses.

stress management discussions

By Todd Peppers
Staff Reporter

 

Take a minute and ask yourself the
following questions: Do I eat at least
one hot, balanced meal a day? Do I
have the appropriate weight for my
height? Do I have an income adequate
to meet basic expenses? Do I get
strength from my religious beliefs?
Do I have a network of friends and ac-
quaintances?

These questions are taken from a
test entitled ‘‘How Vulnerable Are
You To Stress? The test, developed
by psychologists Lyle H. Miller and
Alma Dell Smith, asks 20 questions
which are ranked by how they affect
your life. The resulting score demon-
strates how susceptible a person is to
the daily stresses of life.

As Washington and Lee students
rapidly approach their finals, the ques-
tion of stress management become
more and more timely. Three work-
shops on the topic are being sponsored
by the Health Education Committee of
W&L. On Thursday, Dec. 1, Dr.
James Worth, University Psycholo-
gist, will lecture at 7 p.m. in the Moot
courtroom. The second lecture is
Monday, Dec. 5, at 7 p.m. in the gate
house of Gaines Hall. Dean Schroer-
Lamont, associate dean of students,
and Dr. Horton-Marcella, University
Physician, will lead the discussion.
The final presentation is on Wednes-
day, Dec. 7 in room 109 of the Uni-
versity Center. Dr. Pickral, university
physician, will chair this discussion.

Carol Calkins, program coordinator
of the committee, said, ‘“The idea of

our workshop is to have two different
authorities speak. One will deal with
the psychological aspects and one will
speak on the physiological aspects of
stress and how to manage it.”’

All three discussions, which are
open to the W&L community, will
deal with similar subject matter. Stu-
dents can therefore have a choice of
which workshop to attend. Handouts
on stress management will be avail-
able at each lecture. After the even-
ing’s speaker students can view a
videotape on relaxation techniques.

Calkins added jokingly, ‘‘These lec-
tures will help you survive your final
exams.’’ Students who have difficulty
facing the pressures of finals, or sim-
ply desire to reduce stress levels in
their daily lives, should consider at-
tending.

A news story in the Nov. 17 edition

The fifth paragraph should have
said ‘‘Lexington could perhaps raise!
as much as $250,000 annually througt|

personal property tax rate of 5.5 per-|

The Army Reserve Officers’ Train-
ing Corps (ROTC) Scholarship Pro-
gram provides financial assistance for
the education and training of highly
motivated young men and women who
desire to serve in the military service
as commissioned officers.

In addition to the ROTC four-year
scholarships usually awarded to high
school students entering college, there
are other Army ROTC scholarships
available for students who are already
enrolled in college.

Students who have three years re-
maining toward a baccalaureate de-
gree may apply for a three-year schol-
arship. There are also two-year schol-
arships for students currently enrolled
as college sophomores.

These scholarships pay some of the
college tuition and provide a specified
amount for textbooks, supplies and
educational fees. In addition, schol-
arship winners receive an allowance
of $100 per month for up to ten
months each school year that the
scholarship is in effect. Students also
receive pay for attending the six-

week Advanced Camp during the
summer between the junior and senior
years of college. The benefits from an
ROTC scholarship at Washington and
Lee are worth over $9,000 per year
and there are over 25 W&L students
who are presently enjoying these
benefits.

Three- and two- year scholarships
may be used at any college or univer-
sity where Army ROTC courses aré
offered. Scholarship students are ree
quired to serve in the military for a
period of eight years. This may bé
fulfilled either by serving two to four
years on active duty followed by sery-
ing the remainder of the obligation itt
the Army National Guard or the U.S,
Army Reserve. Or, students could
serve eight years in the Army Nationat
Guard or U.S. Army Reserve follow-
ing the Active Duty completion of an
officer basic course. The ROTC De~«
partment will be taking applications
from qualified freshmen and sopho-
mores starting Dec. 7. If you are in«

Basketball blows out Tigers

 

‘By Jay Plotkin
(Staff Reporter

 

On Tuesday night, the Washington
mand Lee basketball team took the court
\ for its Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
‘ence opener against arch-rival Hamp-
yden-Sydney.
| +41he Generals came into the game
‘with a 2-1 record with wins over Gal-
| Jaudet 80-54 and North Carolina

Wesleyan 86-75 in the W&L Tip-Off

Tournament on Nov. 18-19. The loss
fame on the road to Emory, 94-79,
aver break on Nov. 21.

The Tigers came into the game on a
roll. The pre-season pick to win the
gpnference, they were 4-0 on the
'ygung season and fresh off a 92-91
upset win over Division I William and
Afary.
hey If 1 want to be scared {of H-SC],

Kd look at their stats,"’ said W&L
jhead coach Verne Canfield Tuesday
‘afternoon. “‘They’ve got some awe-
seme stats, and I can’t match up with
their stats.”

),, Indeed Hampden-Sydney came into
the game with very impressive stats.

Aquatics program lo

As a team they were shooting 54 per-

cent from the floor averaging 88
points a game. Five Tigers averaged
in double figures, led by freshman
center Russell Turner and senior
guard Ralph Baker at 20.5 each. Tur-
ner and sophomore , forward Orson
Williams were both shooting at least
63 percent from the field.

‘They've got some talented young
men. They’re young, but they have
some weaknesses,”’ said Canfield be-
fore the game. ‘‘We are going to try to
exploit their weaknesses.

‘*] just have an awfully good feeling
the guys are going to play very well
tonight.”

And Canfield’s gut feeling could not
have been more right.

After falling behind 8-2, the Gen-
erals went on a 13-2 run and never
trailed again. Sophomore guard Mike
Holton’s three- point bomb broke an
8-8 tie and sent the Generals on their
way to a blow out.

When Hampden-Sydney cut the
Generals’ lead to 28-22 with about
seven minutes left in the first half,
Canfield looked down the bench and
found instant offense in sophomore

guard Pat Gallavan. In a little more
than five minutes, Gallavan scored 10
points on five of six shooting, includ-
ing an off-balance 15 footer at the
halftime buzzer to send the Generals
to the locker room with a 43-32 lead.

By halftime, all eight Generals who
played in the first half had scored.
Gallavan led with 10, followed by
sophomore forward Craig Hatfield
with eight, and classmates Chris
Jacobs, Ed Hart, and Holton with six
each.

Just as Gallavan provided the spark
for W&L in the first half from the out-
side, Jacobs, a 6-6 center, and Hart, a
6-5 forward, kept the fire burning
with some outstanding inside play in
the second half.

Jacobs and Hart combined to score
eight of the Generals first 10 second
half points to extend the lead to 51-35.
Both players finished the game with
20 points, and both were perfect from
the foul line. In the second half, the
Generals shot a perfect 10 of 10 from
the charity stripe.

The final score was 94-74 as W&L
threw a balanced attack at H-SC.
Jacobs finished with 20 points and a

Success is a two-edged sword, and Washington and Lee
-Aatics director Page Remillard knows it all too well.

held the evening of Nov. 19.
‘‘Sweet Briar’s focus was on the dance,”

Remillard

‘‘T hope those priorities are reflected in their perfor-
mance at the end of the season.”’

The Generals’ coach was quick to downplay the signifi-
cance of W&L’s performance at the Invitational.

+ )Remillard’s W&L women swimmers enter their 1988-89
j season with the confidence of last year’s Old Dominion
\thletic Conference championship — the first ever confer-
rence championship for a W&L women’s team.
;, But with last year’s success comes pressure to defend
“that title. Remillard said that he and his team will not rest
«on their laurels.
mg Last year, we caught [perennial ODAC swimming
ower]Sweet Briar sleeping,’’ the Generals’ coach said.
But this year the competition will be tougher. They have
Rome strong swimmers back from Europe. Plus, we no
Afonger have a diving program.”
# For all Remillard’s concern, however, the Generals
Shave gotten off to an impressive start — and they have
FHone so against their ODAC rivals.
8 At the W&L Invitational, held Nov. 19-20 at Cy Twom-
Ply Pool, W&L got a chance to size up those rivals, includ-
eing Sweet Briar. The Generals won the meet, sending a
Message that they are prepared to pick up right where they
Heft off last season.
Pesweet Briar, the’only ODAC. team to. defeat W&L. in.a
yyrdnal meet last year, chose not to participate in the final ses-
sion of the Invitational, largely due to the meet’s schedul-
ing conflict with VMI's Ring Figure dance, which was

KELLY’S CORNER

   
 
   
  
 
 
  
   

   

“The Invitational is an early-season opportunity for the
teams to meet each other and establish the competition,”’
Remillard said. ‘‘It should not be interpreted as how the
season will go. It helps us get a sense of the quality in each
event, and it is especially helpful for freshmen to evaluate
the other teams and for they themselves to be evaluated. ””

Meanwhile, the team is continuing to train hard for its
dual-meet season, with particular emphasis on the after-
noon of Dec. 7. The opponent? Sweet Briar.

Judging from the strength of the swimmers this year,
Remillard and his swimmers ought to have good reason to
anticipate a repeat performance. Senior Elizabeth Miles
already has qualified for the NCAA Division III national
championships in the 1650-yard freestyle. Classmate
Nancy Whalen and juniors Kris Amoroso and Heather
Logan will be key competitors in the sprint freestyle, the
backstroke and the breaststroke, respectively.

Sophomores Sharon Coleman, Rachelle Nock and Kris-
tin Wagner are expected to excel in the butterfly, the
breaststroke and distante-évert The’ roster Of promising”

Dunford, Alex Glynn, Jodi Herring and Stephanie
McHaney.

 

game-high 11 rebounds. Hart finished
with 20 points, Gallavan added 15 in
just 13 minutes, and Holton had 13
points and seven assists. Brading, the
team’s leading scorer, tallied just five.

‘*That’s one of the nice things about
this win,’’ said Canfield after the win.
‘‘Here, our key player in terms of
stats, had an off game. Someone else
picked up the slack. Chris|Jacobs] had
probably his best game I’ve seen here
at W&L last year or this year.

**T thought everybody had a part in
it [the win,] and that’s Washington
and Lee basketball, that’s what I
like.”

One other thing that Canfield was
impressed with was the crowd. A rau-
cous throng of 1,447 turned out for
the game, and that is appreciated by
the basketball team. ‘‘It was really
nice to see the people in the stands
standing up and clapping. We need
them here next Wednesday for
Bridgewater, and with their help, we
just might be able to do that job.””

Next, the 3-1 Generals hit the road
for games at Greensboro on Thursday
and Lynchburg on Saturday.

oks to improve on last season’s success

Nation’s Top 8 is goal for men’s team

 

From Staff Reports

 

It seems that almost every year the expectations for the
Washington and Lee men’s swim team get greater and
greater, and yet, year after year, head coach Page Remil-
lard and his charges meet and go beyond those expec-
tations.

Will the trend continue in 1988-89? Even Remillard ad-
mits it will be difficult for the men’s team to better its
11th-place finish in the Division III National Champion-
ships a year ago.

Difficult yes, but don’t think for a minute that the W&L
swimmers don’t have their sights set on repeating — and
going beyond — the achievements of the past.

Last season, the men’s team captured the Atlantic States
Championship and then went on to the national champion-
ships, where seven Generals garnered All-America hon-
ors. All seven of those All-Americans are back for the men
this year and head coach Page Remillard has set his team’s
goals accordingly.

‘At nationals, we want to get into the top 10, and really,
we’re shooting for a finish in the top eight,’’ said Remil-
lard, whose W&L career record of 42-36-1 places him
third behind W&L swimming coaching legends E.P.
‘*Cy‘* Twombly and Bill Stearns. **We’ve got a very diffi-
cult duat-meet schedule ahead GPs.’

’ W&L ‘has already gotten of Ma strong start, defeating ~

VMI 149-78 on Nov. 16. ‘‘The VMI meet really helped
get our mental frame on swimming,”’ said Remillard.

‘I’m feeling better about this team than I felt about last
year’s. They are acting like a team that wants to go out and
win it.””

The Generals will meet the challenge of 1988-89 with a
talented stock of veterans and an equally talented set of
newcomers. Topping that list has to be junior backstroker
David Olson, who captured All-America honors in seven
events last year.

Olson, who broke three school records last season, came
within one-hundredth of a second of winning the 100-yard
backstroke at nationals. Olson also earned All-America
status in the 200-yard backstroke, the 200-yard individual
medley, the 200- yard medley relay, 400-yard medley re-
lay, the 200-yard freestyle relay, and the 400-yard frees-
tyle relay.

Six other Generals who earned All-America status in
1988, seniors Moose Herring, Jeff Bercaw, David Dietz
and David Reavy and juniors Adam Morgan and Shawn
Copeland, are also back this season. Reavy, Copeland and
Dietz, along with Olson, were part of the school-record
400-yard medley relay team that finished sixth at nationals
last year, while Copeland and Olson joined Herring and
Bercaw on the eighth-place 200-medley team.

Bercaw also grabbed All-America honors in the 100 but-
terfly, while Copeland reached that level in the 200 breast-
stroke.

‘*1 think we have an excellent mix this year,’ Remillard
said. ‘*We're young and yet we're experienced, too. It de-
finitely should be a positive experience. When experience
is the difference in a meet, we'll have what it takes.

Fleshtones

Staff Report

 

 

Since May of 1976, the Fleshtones
have been the purveyors of authentic,
home-made, rave-up, rock'n'roll
sounds. Formed in the bedroom bor-
ough of Queens, home and birthplace
of the rock‘n’roll revolution in the
mid 70's (which boasts such other lu-
minaries as members of The Dicta-
tors, Ramones, and New York Dolls),
the Fleshtones have created a reputa-
tion for uproarious live performances
as well as sought after, innovative col-
lector-item type LP’s. They've estab-
lished a world-wide presence and are
considered by the international rock
press to be one of America’s most im-
portant and influential bands.

Remarkably the band has changed
‘very little since its formation. The
major changes were the addition of
drummer Bill Milhizer in 1980 (taking
the place of Lenny Calderone Il) and
the recent departure of original bassist

Jan Marek Pakulski in the fall of *86.
Though the band was saddened (but
not weakened) by Marek’s choice to
pursue his other career options, his
place is now ably filled by the equally

University ensembles

headine

slender and tall Robert Warren. A
native of Georgia by way of the Lower
Side, Robert can occasionally still be
seen drawing long cool ones behind
the bar of the infamous King Tut's
Wah Wah Hut on Avenue A in NYC.
Another moonlighting Fleshtone, the
charming and vivacious frontman,
Peter Zaremba can be seen monthly
on MTV, hosting the award winning
show, ‘‘The Cutting Edge.”’

The new LP ‘‘Fleshtones Vs. Reali-
ty’’ on Embargo Records, long
awaited and eagerly anticipated, more
than fulfills any expectations that have
developed over the past 3 years. The
new record gives an indication of the
breadth of the Fleshtones writing abil-
ity and provides a much clearer idea
of the band’s completely honorable
motives. Self-produced with James A.
Ba.., this album exhibits production
values that anyone from the diehard
garage/psychedelia fan to the most
discerning radio programmer can ap-
preciate.

If you cut to the core of the Flesh-
tones you'll find that they stand for
FUN, TRUTH & TRADITION in
rock'n'roll, which, after all, are inse-
parable.

to present ‘Messiah’

 

Staff Report

Lee University will present Handel’s

Winter Hours will open

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

They have been likened to R.E.M.,
but said to be better. They have been
likened to The Church on certain
songs, but better. One critic in Con-
trast even said, ‘‘...these guys can
pick up where Murmur left off and
make you forget you’ve ever heard
another jangle in your life.’’ Welcome
to the music of Winter Hours.

For any of you who haven't heard
of Winter Hours before now, don’t
worry. You'll be hearing lots from
them in the future. With only two EPs
(Churches, Wait Till the Morning) and
a 12-inch (The Confessional) to their
credit before 1987, they finally hit the
mainstream in January of that year
with Leaving Time, and LP that made
it up to at last number eight on the
College Albums chart in Rolling
Stone.

Winter Hours, comprised of Joseph
Marques on lead vocals, Bob Messing
on bass, Bob Perry and Michael Car-
lucci on guitar and John Albanese on
drums, seem to able to play it all.
‘The Confessional’’ and ‘“‘We Can
Only Win’’ hit hard while *‘Have You
Ever Loved a Woman’’ kicks back
into the blues of Derek and the Do-
minoes. ‘‘Ten Minutes’’ is acoustical-

The Ring-tum Phi, December 1, 1988

ly new and improved from its debut on
The Confessional in 1986 and ‘*Wait-
ing for the Thunder’’ rocks loud and
clear while ‘‘If I Could Make You
Hear Me”’ bursts with energy. While
musically versatile, Winter Hours re-
tains and never loses touch with their
folky sound.

How do the guys in Winter Hours
feel about all of this?

‘Right now, we're kind of at a
midpoint for us, where we're not
completely unknown but we’re not
Bon Jovi either,’’ (the band’s from
New Jersey) said Marques in a May
28, 1987 Connecticut newspaper arti-
cle. ‘‘So our writing and shows reflect
that in that we’re still learning and as-
similating all these new experiences.”

Regardless of what they are still
learning, you can bet that tomorrow
night's concert will be well worth at-
tending and not one you can dare miss
if you are a fan of rock music. In addi-
tion to their own repertoire, the band
is notorious for playing excellent
covers of The Hollies, Patti Smith and
Bob Dylan including ‘‘All Along the
Watch Tower,’’ a song that is sure to
regain popularity after its inclusion in
U2’s album and film U2: Rattle and
Hum.

Don’t miss Winter Hours tomorrow
night; a band on the cutting edge of
having New Jersey saying Bruce who?

Wa&L clarifies renaissance program

~

By Greg Euston
Staff Reporter

 

Yesterday's, today’s and
tomorrow’s fraternity members will
be bearing the burden of renovating
fraternity houses as the university
begins its Fraternity Renaissance Pro-
gram in the spring of 1990.

In a presentation designed to clear
up misconceptions about the program,
University President John D. Wilson,
board of trustees member J. Thomas
Touchton, VMDO architect David
Oakland and chairman of the Fraterni-
ty House Renovation Steering Com-
mittee, Col. Paul Murphy, spoke to an
audience of mostly freshmen and
sophomores in Lee Chapel Tuesday
night.

The most important feature of the
Renaissance program centers around
the renovation of the individual
chapter houses.

“*We want to preserve the character
of the houses,’’ said Oakland, one of
the architects for the project.

The board of trustees will finance
the renovations for $10 million. Half
of that $10 million will come from a

Live Drive
recruiting
members

By Stacy L. Morrison
Staff Reporter

 

Live Drive, which describes itself
as a student organization ‘‘committed
to the elimination of intoxicated driv-
ing,’’ will hold a new member
registration drive next week.

““We don’t have adequate human
resources yet,’’ said Live Drive co-
ordinator John Fialcowitz. Every day
from noon to | p.m., Live Drive
members will have a table outside the
Co-op and the law school library to
recruit new members, said Live Drive
Publicity Director Amy Sapp.

‘*We’re looking to get more people
driving so we can run more often,”’
Sapp said. Prospective drivers must
have ‘‘a good driving record and a
high sense of responsibility,’’ said
Fialcowitz.

Sapp said Live Drive would like to
recruit enough members so that each
member would have to put in only two
hours a month.

Currently, there are 31 drivers.in the
organization, said Fialcowitz, and ap-
proximately 40 people in the group al-
together. ‘“‘There is too much of a
strain on a small group of people, ‘‘
said Fialcowitz.

Anyone who is interested at all
should sign up, Sapp said. ‘‘There are
a lot of things to do besides driving,”’
she said, such as scheduling and pub-
licity. The group also needs people to
ride with the students who drive the
vans.

To date, Live Drive has carried
1,076 students since it began running
Homecoming weekend this year, said
Sapp. For last week’s Connells con-
cert at the new pavilion, Live Drive
transported 193 students.

‘*We have been pleased that people
have been using Live Drive, said
Sapp, but she thinks not enough
students feel comfortable leaving their
cars at a function and using the Live
Drive van to get home if they have had
too much to drink.

direct grant from the university
through alumni and other donations.

The other $5 million is a loan to in-
dividual : fraternities. The loan’s
repayment will be stretched over the
next 30 years. ‘‘We feel,’’ said
Touchton, ‘‘that the cost should be
borne by the fraternity members of the
future who will benefit most from the
renovations. We also feel that the
fraternity members of the past should
help pay because they are partially
responsible for the present condi-
tion.”’

Wilson said that after houses are
rebuilt, fraternity members can expect
to pay higher dues and rent. ‘‘Rent
should include some money for the
cleaning and maintenance of the
houses,’’ he said.

However, he added that he hoped
“‘room and board will be no more ex-
pensive than similar university ser-
vices.””

Oakland said that because fraternity
house rent is so low, residents treat it
as low rent housing. Parties are the
other cause of damage to houses,
Oakland said. Each new house design
will include a specially designed party
facility.

In trade for new houses, fraternities
are required to adopt the ‘‘Standards
for Fraternities at Washington and
Lee University’’ adopted by the uni-
versity last year. The standards set
forth operating guidelines that define
the privileges and responsibilities of
the fraternity houses. The standards
also state that fraternity housing must
be equal in conditions to university
housing.

House mothers are included in the
standards as well. Associate Dean of
Students, Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy”’ Atkins,
said, ‘‘House mothers are there to
serve as a resident manager, to make
life more convenient for the residents.
They're there so the students don’t
have to worry about the day to day
running of the house. Students age
here to go to school, not be a
housewife or a handyman.”’

In his address to the Greek com-
munity, Col. Murphy dispelled two
popular myths about the Fraternity
Renaissance program. The first myth,
he said, is that the university plans to
close the fraternities after they gain
control of them. He recalled a recent
Ring-tum Phi cartoon saying that the
best way to get rid of fraternities is by

helping them. Murphy emphasized
that this was not the case and the uni-
versity has no ulterior motive in the
program.

The other myth, he said, is that the
*‘Standards for Fraternities’’ will turn
them into ‘‘mamby-pamby eating
clubs.’ This also is not true, he said.

“Party facilities are being included

in every house design so members can
continue to party in the style they have
become accustomed to.’ He added
that party facilities are usually the
single most expensive item in the
renovation.

During his address, Wilson describ-
ed the state of fraternities over the last
two decades. Counter-culture values

have become a part of fraternities over
the last 20 years, he said. It began
with the war effort, he said, and de
veloped into anti-military, anti
government and anti-fraternity.

The result has been a loss of leader
ship in fraterm‘ies. loss of support

written by J. Thomas Touchton of the

Sorority rush set to start

Three Sororities Make The Final Cut

 

by Eleanor Nelson
Staff Reporter

 

Three national sororities, Chi
Omega, Kappa Alpha Theta and Kap-
pa Kappa Gamma, will begin coloniz-
ing on the W&L campus Jan. 22.

The Sorority Advisory Committee
voted on the decision in its meeting
last Sunday, Jan. 8, after discussing
the presentations that five national
sororities gave on campus last week.
Kappa Delta and Pi Beta Phi were the
two sororities not selected after the
presentations.

The advisory committee, comprised
of students, faculty and administra-
tion, invited the sororities to make
presentations at W&L according to the
interest of women indicated on a
Sorority Interest Survey and after con-
sidering research the committee had
done on the sororities that had con-
tacted W&L. The committee gave
each of the sororities a list of ques-
tions concerning such issues as the

process of rush and colonization and
the possibility of housing assistance.

The criteria for selection included
how long a chapter advisor from the
national sorority would remain on
campus to assist the colony and how
well the presentation answered the
committee’s questions. The com-
mittee also considered the sorority’s
statement of discrimination against
race, religion, creed or handicap.
Students attending the presentations
were encouraged to leave the com-
mittee written comments about the
sororities.

For the presentations, each of the
sororities sent officers from their
national office and representatives
who had advised chapters colonizing
on other campuses. Some of the
sororities brought current members
from other campuses and invited their
local alumni to come also.

The individual sororities will send
their national representatives for ex-
tension to the W&L campus. The

Executive Committee

EC appoints committee to review CRC

 

By Genienne Mongno
Staff Reporter

 

After reviewing the recently releas-
ed Confidential Review Committee
(CRC) procedures Monday
night, the Executive Committee mov-
ed to form a sub-committee to present
the CRC with several suggestions
concerning the new procedures.

E.C. members Dan DuPre and
Dave Nave and E.C. Secretary Eddie
Yu were appointed to the committee
which was to present the suggestions
this week to Professor Samuel J.
Kozak, head of the CRC.

Specifically, several E.C. members
said they were concerned that the pro-

cedures did not allow for cross-

examination of the complainant during
the hearing. The question was raised
as to whether the lack of cross-
examination was inflicting on the right
of those involved to due process of
law.

There were additional problems
found with the wording of some of the
sections of the procedures.

Nave said that he believes the
CRC’s definition of sexual harassment
is unclear. He said he would like to
see a more precise definition or an ex-
planation as to why the definition is
vague.

The E.C. has no power to actually
make changes in the procedures,
which were adopted by the faculty at
its December meeting.

According to Kozak, copies of the

CRC procedure are availzble through
the office of Lewis John, dean of
students.

Kozak said that as of now the pro-
cedures are in their final working
form, adding that if the CRC finds that
the procedures are not workable it will
review and modify them in the future.

The CRC was formed by a faculty
vote last spring after an ad hoc review
committee decided that there was not a
sufficient outlet for complaints of an
especially sensitive subject matter,
those dealing with cases of sexual,
racial or religious slurs and sexual
harassment

The committee is composed of four
faculty members and three students.

national director for the extension of
sororities, Mrs. William Bradford,
also will come to the campus to
organize the rush and colonization
process. All W&L women wishing to
participate in the colonizing of
sororities must attend one of the two
mandatory pre-rush registrations; the
first registration meeting was on
Wednesday, and the second will be
from 4 to 6 p.m Friday, Jan. 13, in
Lee Chapel.

On Sunday, Jan. 22, the sororities
will begin holding ‘‘open houses’’ in
various rooms of the University
Center, according to the advisory
committee. Monday and Tuesday,
Jan. 23 and 24, they will interview
groups of women.

Wednesday, Jan. 25, the sororities
will ask the women back to
‘preference parties’’ after a process
of matching the women’s preference
to those of the sororities. On Thurs-
day, Jan. 26, the sororities will extend
their bids to the women.

believes the changes in the fraternity
system will help elevate the fraternity
system to the high level of standards
shared by the rest of the university
community.

Touchton said in the letter that the
fraternity system has not been em-
phasizing the qualities and values that
W&L stands for. He also said an
*‘animal house fraternity culture’ has
become popular over the last two
decades and this was something that
has been tolerated too long.

‘The board of trustees does not in-

tend to be supportive of the behavior
at W&L that reflects negatively on our
institution and its values,’’ Touchton
wrote.

Touchton cited negative values such
as the abuse of alcohol, drugs and
female guests. He also said students
“‘can be more conscious of
their academic opportunities. "’

Dean of the College John Elrod
said, ‘‘Tom Touchton thinks it is
necessary to communicate’ with
everybody who has a vested interest.”’

Wilson returns

‘to Wé&aL

By Genienne Mongno
Staff Reporter

 

Washington & Lee President John
D. Wilson, who returned on Dec. 14
after a three month leave of absence
spent in England, said he enjoyed
every day of his time abroad but is
happy to be back on campus.

Wilson said the board of trustees
gave him the ‘‘gift’’ of three months
away from his administrative duties so
he could concentrate on scholarly ac-
tivities. He went to England because
he graduated from Oxford University
and wanted a chance to return to fur-
ther explore the subject of England
during the 16th century.

Specifically, Wilson said he was in-
terested in relations between England
and Ireland during the 16th century.
He said he spent most of his three
months researching ‘‘an unusual Irish
character’? named Hugh O'Neill.

According to Wilson, O’Neill went
to England as a young boy and spent
seven years living with the prominent
English family of Sir Philip Sidney.
After learning English and the religion
of the English people. O'Neil
returned to Ireland where he himself
rose to a prominent position, rebelled
against the English Queen Elizabeth
and demanded both restoration of con-
fiscated Irish and freedom of religion

duties

for the Irish.

Wilson said O'Neill was a major
force in the attempt to unite Ireland at
that time.

Wilson said at Oxford he was able
to get library materials on the subject
not otherwise available to him. He
said he also got the chance to visit
many of the places in Ireland that were
important in O’Neill’s life.

In addition to his research on
O'Neill, Wilson said he learned a lot
about the problems Oxford is facing
today. Specifically, he said the
students at Oxford were ‘‘up-in-
arms’ over the fact that the Thatcher
government wanted to introduce stu-
dent loans rather than academic
grants.

“‘It was interesting to see the argu-
ment unfold, ** he said, adding that
although in the United States students
are used to the idea of educational
loans, the concept is new to the
English.

Wilson also met with several W&L
students who are presently studying at
Oxford.

While he was away Wilson said he
had very little contact with the univer-
sity or Dean of the College John
Elrod, who was acting president dur-
ing his absence.

The Washington and Lee University
Minority Student Association will
celebrate Martin Luther King’s birth-
day Monday, Jan. 16, at 8 p.m. at the
First Baptist Church in Lexington.
The theme of this year’s program is
“Words and Music in Celebration of
the Life of Martin Luther King, Jr.”’
The program will feature Lovida H.
Coleman Jr., a Washington, D.C.
lawyer as the principle speaker, and

the Washington and Lee Glee Club
will sing spiritual music.

Coleman said she will be speaking
on the continuing relevance of the a-
chievements of Martin Luther King
with focus on how these achievements
relate to each individual person.

“His ultimate destiny is still to be
determined by what each of us do,”’
she said in a telephone interview to-
day. Coleman said the speech will

- OPINION

 

Sororities ...

The inevitable has arrived. After three and a half years of wat-
ching and waiting, sorority rush will begin on Jan. 22.

The debate began back in 1985 when W&L’s first coed class
enrolled. Would there be sororities? Dissension and indecision
among the group of just over 100 women shoved the debate into the
shadows, for the university administration decided to defer the
decision on sororities until there were four classes of women at
W&L. Even so, the debate continued. Petitions and surveys floated
around campus, but the results never indicated a majority of women

interested in colonizing sororities.

Arguments for and against sororities abound. The former argue
that sororities would provide ‘‘a place to call our own’’ and a
‘place to return to when we graduate.’ The latter argue that
sororities would foster cliques and division among the already small

numbers of women.

However, the fact is that rush will start, regardless, in 10 days.
Obviously, those women who pushed for sororities will participate,
but those who were of the opposite opinion should also consider
rushing—if only to prevent the sorority system from becoming what
they were afraid it could become in the first place—the stereotype of
cliquey and snotty girls. It is not hypocritical if one considers it this

way.

People benefit from diverse viewpoints since they become open
to more possibilities. The concerns of those women who were
against sororities can become a sounding board to help the female
Greeks become more unified and sensitive to the needs and con-
cerns of women in the W&L community.

Sororities must be viewed as a challenge—the clay that W&L
women must shape into a form that accommodates many different

tastes.

Year In Review

Sbar view
by Jon Sbar

ON a cold day in January when
our ancestors were still evolving from
large reptiles, a lazy prehistoric
neanderthal journalist named Toad
was watching ‘‘Return of the Tyran-

nosaurus Rex’’ on television when .

suddenly the telephone rang. It was
the editor of the ‘‘Daily Dinosaur’’
calling to remind Toad that he had a
story deadline in three hours.

As Toad began brainstorming for a
story subject, it occurred to him that
he could save time and energy by
writing an article commemorating the
top stories of last year. Toad’s idea
caught on and ever since that day,
newspaper readers have been bom-
barded in early January with
thousands of ‘‘Year in Review’’ ar-
ticles written by lazy journalists.
Because I am a lazy journalist and
because it is early January, I am com-
pelled to review last year’s top news
stories. Stop: The Society for the
Preservation of Prehistoric History
interrupts this article to correct Mr.
Sbar’s total disregard for the
historical record. First of all, man
did not evolve from large reptiles,
he did not have television sets and
telephones, and finally, there is no
evidence whatsoever that a
newspaper publication entitled
“The Daily Dinosaur’? or a man
named Toad ever existed.

The first great news story of 1988 is
‘*Merit-badge grudge festers,’’ a UPI
report published in the Tampa
Tribune. A 25-year-old man in Illinois
‘*stalked and stabbed’’ his Scout-
master because when the former Boy
Scout was in eighth grade (12 years
ago) the Scoutmaster denied him a

» merit badge. The estranged Boy Scout

- decided to track down his old Scout-

master after he happened to see him
drive pastoneday,

ihe best letter wiitten to a publica-

tion in 1988 was from someone who

wrote to Parade Magazine espousing

the belief that Manic Depression is a

sexually transmitted disease.

‘*Male Striper Bumps and Grinds
Down Candy Aisle in Circle K”’
comes from the AP and the Salt Lake
City Tribune. At 3 a.m. in a Circle K
store, a man stripped to a G-string and
leather jacket and ‘‘bumped and
ground’’ his way down the candy ai-
sle, much to the delight of the female
clerk. Later that night, the man was
arrested for indecent exposure outside
of a different convenience store.

Another top story of the year con-
cerns that pelvis-thrashing, Saturday
matinee movie making, side burn
growing drug-using rock star, Elvis
Presley. Although he died years ago,
millions of people claim to have seen
‘‘The King’’ working at gas stations,
surfing in California, selling en-
cyclopedias or break dancing in New
York City. While these theories sound
plausible, I know them to be incor-
rect. I can say this because I know
where Elvis really is. In fact, I talked
to him yesterday. Here’s the real
story: He’s a finance major right here
at W&L, he’s in a Southern fraternity
(don’t forget, he’s from Tennessee),
he’s off hard drugs and now only oc-
casionally uses recreational drugs,
and he plans to be a stock broker. If
we play our cards right, I bet we could
get him to play at Fancy Dress.

As predicted by literacy critics, the
Weekly World News had another
banner 1988. Here are the headlines
from some of the better stories:

**Steroids turn man into bigfoot’’

*‘Noah’s Ark found on Soviet
Mountain’’

“Man sneezes so hard — eyeballs
pop out”’

“‘UFO base camp found in New
Mexico’’

‘“*Toddler grows up in ant bed —
ants fed her for years’’

**12-year-old classmate gets teacher
and four classmates pregnant’’

“‘Doctor keeps wife’s head alive for
10 years”’

(Special note for skeptical
readers; these headlines are totally
fictional. My sources have verified

every single one.)

Prospectives with athletic potential being unfairly overlooked

To the Editors:

I think most of the juniors and seniors would
agree that Washington and Lee us not the same
school they came to three or four years ago. We
have been forced to accept changed social at-
mosphere, increased faculty involvement in stu-
dent activities and affairs, and occasional, un-
justified police harassment whether we like it or
not, most W&L students have accepted this
change as permanent. Also, Washington and Lee
has begun to increase the standards of acceptance
to new heights. My concern is that we are
overlooking prospective students who could

potentially add a lot more to W&L than just ab- ©

normally high test scores.

Certainly, a brilliant student is to be credited,
however, W&L has never been and should not
pretend to be a school of bookworms. W&L
should look for a well-rounded student who may
add to other aspects of student life. One need not
look any further than the athletic department for
evidence of this phenomena. Just about every
coach is having a nightmare recruiting because of
the standards imposed by the admissions com-
mittee. If this trend continues, I don’t see it possi-
ble to compete with other schools such as David-

son and Emory who will allow their coaches the
opportunity to recruit athletes who may not have
done particularly well on one section of the SAT, -
but have demonstrated the ability to work hard
and excel in all aspects of their high school ca-
reers.

The truth is that W&L is rejecting many of
these student/athletes who are being accepted at
Davidson, Emory and Vanderbilt — all schools
that W&L is constantly competing with and being
compared to. The disheartening fact of the matter
is that these students want to come to W&L and
help continue a tradition which has existed for
over 100 years. The admissions committee and
certain members of the faculty seem to be under a
type of ‘‘peer pressure’ to see how high they can
make the median SAT. Id this the criteria of a tru-
ly exceptional university? I think not.

To this end, what is wrong with giving W&L
athletics the opportunity to be competitive in a
national atmosphere? Why should coaches be re-
stricted to recruiting players with above 1100 on
their SAT? I am not saying to let every athlete in,
but certainly some concessions can be made to
help coached recruit players who are getting in to
other highly competitive universities. Without a

doubt, putting a little emphasis on athletic success
cannot help but to increase the reputation of the
school. Who doesn’t want to be associated with a
winner? Look at schools such as Stanford, which
maintains its reputation as one of the most com-

<

~

petitive schools in the country and has won °

NCAA Championships in tennis, baseball,
swimming and gymnastics in the past five years.
Successful extracurricular activities do nothing
but enhance the reputation of a school. We have
started to improve our facilities with the construc-
tion of a new arts building and hopefully that will

«

«

encourage more performers to come to W&L. ,

However, 40 percent of the W&L student body
participates in varsity athletics and look at our
facilities compared to Davidson, Emory and
Rhodes(all schools similar in size to W&L) and
you can see that little commitment the administra-
tion has made to athletics. Maybe this problem is
not evident now, but as someone who tries to keep
up with athletics, I think it is just a matter of time.
If this trend continues, not only will our athletic
teams be losers, but the school itself will be a big
loser.

ROTC scholarships offer more than just financial aid

To the Editors:

I am writing in response to the headline printed
above an article on ROTC scholarships in the
Dec. | issue. The headline reads, ‘‘ROTC has a
deal for needy students.’’ This makes me think
that the editors believe that ROTC is just another
form of financial aid. This could not be further
from the truth.

The mission of Army ROTC is to commission
the future officer leadership of the United States
Army. It is not to provide funds for the ‘tneedy”’
students of W&L to attend college. The Army
provides scholarships to help students during their
college years but it is by no means a free handout.

ROTC scholarship recipients work for that schol-
arship, both physically and mentally. However,
the reward is a commission as a second lieutenant.
A recipient of financial aid may receive a diploma
after four years, but only those in the ROTC pro-
gram will receive the ‘‘special trust and con-
fidence’ given by a commission in the Armed
Forces from the President of the United States.
Most, if any all, of our Cadets on scholarship
do not need the Army to pay for their tuition.
They joined the ROTC program because they are
not satisfied with being run-of-the-mill. They
want the responsibility, the challenge that is avail-
able through the Armed Forces. A second lieute-

nant in some cases will give orders that ask of his
men what, in other circumstances, no one would
have the right to ask. Do you still feel that ROTC
is just another form of financial aid? I hope not
because by doing so you not only insult those who
are in the ROTC program now but also those who
have dedicated their lives to a profession tasked
with protecting the democratic society which
allows you to be so creative in your journalism. I
hope I have sufficiently cleared up this matter and
I thank you for your attention.

W&L women’s clubs to offer alternatives to sororities

To the undergraduate women at Washington
and Lee:

The women of W&L will be making several im-
portant decisions in the near future. These deci-
sions will have a significant impact on the social
scene at W&L. We represent a group of women
interested in establishing social organizations
different from sororities. Encouraged by the ad-
ministration’s stated commitment to respond to

the wishes of a significant number of women, a
steering committee has been organized, has met,
and is preparing a proposal to the university. This
proposal will be discussed at a meeting slated for
next week (look for flyers) and could include con-
sideration of eating clubs or similar non-
exclusionary social groups. We invite all inter-
ested women to join us to learn about and con-
tribute to the proposal.

Honor code called into con@ideration on the subject of alcohol

To the Editors:

Consider the following argument:

1. It is dishonorable knowingly to break the
law.

2. All W&L students know that it is against the
law for anyone under 21 to purchase, possess or

consume any alcoholic beverage.

3. Therefore, any W&L student under 21 who
purchases, possesses or consumes any alcoholic
beverage is dishonorable.

I suspect that very many people will have an in-
terest in denying the conclusion of this argument,
and hence they will reject the argument. But on

Student Calis for Rejuvenated Mascot

To the Editors;

In attempts to raise school spirit I began to think
about our school’s mascot. I quickly realized that
we do not use our mascot, the General, on many
of our official banners, uniforms, notebooks, etc.
Also, we do not have a live representation of our

mascot at any of our athletic events. I have spoken
to Coach McHenry, the E.C., and some students;
all were enthusiastic about having a mascot at the
games, but they were unsure about keeping our
current mascot. (The Yosemite Sam looking gen-
eral won a contest several years ago, which had

what grounds? Does the conclusion not follow
from the premises? Are the premises not true?

I would be pleased to learn from the readers of
the Phi how they deal with this argument.
Reasoned responses alone are welcome.

mink, the Liberty Hall volunteers, or a new gen-

any action taken; please direct any comments to

APO Christmas Tree has Become a Library Tradition

To the Editors:

Those of us who enjoyed the Christmas tree in
the main lobby of the University Library during
the hectic two weeks before the holiday break are
indebted to W&L’s service organization, APO,

and in particular to Dan Knight, Dorothy Mills,
and Steve Ingram of that organization. The three
students spent an afternoon finding the tree, chop-
ping it down and placing it in a tree stand. The
**APO Christmas tree’’ has become a tradition at
the library. I would be remiss in my duty if I did

not direct the praise and appreciation for the tree
to those who did the work!

Education
concerns

IFC

by Clint Wheelock
Staff Reporter

The majority of the Jan. 3 Inter-
fraternity Council meeting dealt with
the upcoming period of pledge edu-
cation for freshmen in Washington
and Lee’s 16 fraternity houses. In ad-
dition to the normal representatives,

pledge class presidents were invited to
listen to the details of this stage in

their preparation for initiation. In ac-

cordance with By-Law VII of the IFC

Constitution, the pledge education
programs will begin Monday, Jan. 9,
and must not continue for more than
10 weeks.

IFC President Ross Singletary and
W&L’s Dean of Greek Affairs, Leroy
C. ‘Buddy’’ Atkins, stressed the
rules for pledge programs as laid
down in the IFC Constitution. All
forms of hazing are prohibited, as are
any activities that may pose a physical
or emotional hazard to the individual.

Pledge activities are limited to one:
weeknight per week and must not take ?

place outside the corporate limits of f

Lexington, in or around the freshman)
dormitories or at any time past 8 p.m.

Fraternities nationwide are facing
the dangerous consequences of pledge
hazing in the forms of forced alcohol
consumption and physical and emo-
tional abuse. Dean Atkins said that if
any serious problems
such as these arise, it will mean ‘‘the
end of your chapter on this campus for
good’’ with ‘‘no appeal.’’ He added
that “‘this is the single biggest problem
that fraternities have... it's got to stop,
and this is the year it’s going to.”’

The 28 W&L pledges who did not
achieve the 1.9 cumulative grade point
average required for initiation are
subsequently ineligible to participate
in pledge programs until they have
brought up their average. Likewise,
they cannot be required by their
fraternities to maintain residence in
the house during their sophomore
year.

Casino night ‘Big’ success

 

By Genienne Mongo
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee Muscular
Dystrophy Superdance Committee
sponsored the first Casino Night in the
General’s Headquarters Tuesday night
and according to the members of the
committee, it was a big success.

“‘It was a phenomenal success!”
said senior Debra Hurtt, co-
chairmwoman of the Superdance
Committee. She said the total intake
for the evening ws $1,300, but more
important than the money raised was
the enthusiasm generated for the
Superdance.

‘*The important thing about this and
other promotional events is that we
spread the word about Muscular
Dystrophy and educate the student
body, including the law students.
Hopefully, this will create an en-
thusiasm and influence people to do-
nate their time and money,” said
Wright Ledbetter, co-chairman of the
Superdance Committee.

The original idea for Casino Night
belonged to Lea Santamaria, head of
the Specials Events Committee who is
studying abroad for the rest of the

year. She followed through with the
idea and found all the equipment
needed before she left, said Ledbetter.

The rest of the committee took over
where Santamaria left off, creating a
simulated casino where students could
purchase and gamble with fake
**Superdance Dollars.”’

The event was open by invitation
only to those undergraduate and law
students over the age of 21. According
to Ledbetter, the committee was
“trying to be in touch with the older
crowd and the law students who are a
vital part of the W&L community.”

Originally, the event was scheduled
to run from 9:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m.,
but because so many students showed
up, the gambling was allowed to con-
tinue until 12:30 a.m.

Afterwards, the students were given
a chance to use their “‘Superdance
Dollars’’ to bid for a variety of prizes
at an auction held in the Fairfax
Lounge. Prizes included ski passes, a
Fancy Dress package, free tuxedo ren-
tals and Superdance shirts.

Ledbetter said he was especially
thankful to all the people who donated
their time to make Casino Night a
success, including the staff of the

General’s Headquarters and the Chi
Psi fraternity, whose pledges were on
hand all night to run the various
tables.

“IT hope the enthusiasm displayed
tonight can be carried through the re-
maining weeks leading up to the actual
dance. We hope to get the entire stu-
dent body involved,”’ said Ledbetter.

Faculty sponsor Fontanne Bostic
said, “‘It’s not too late to participate,
either by being a dancer or a spec-
tator. Dance for those who can’t.
That's what it’s all about.””

The Muscular Dystrophy Super-
dance will be held in the student ac-
tivities building on Feb. 3 and 4 from
6:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. Friday night
will feature a ‘‘Battle of the Bands”
contest and Saturday there will be two
“*big name bands”’ to be announced in
the next few weeks, said Bostic.

Students who want to dance must
raise a minimum of $100 in pledges.
The grand prize will be awarded to the
dancer with the most pledges/cash
raised. Any student interested in danc-
ing should pick up an information
packet at Carol Calkins’ office in the
University Center.

TALKBACK

 

' Library celebrates

decade of service

Staff Report

 

Tuesday marked the 10th an-
niversary of the opening of the new
Washington and Lee University
Library.

It was 10 years ago that day when
1,700 volunteers — students, alumni,
faculty, staff, and townspeople —
toted Leggett department store shop-
ping bags full of books from the old
McCormick Library to the univer-
sity’s new 130,000-square-foot
building. In an unprecedented com-
munity wide effort, 140,000 books
were moved from the old library to the
proper shelf areas in the new facility
in 2 and one-half hours. The ‘Great
Move’’ was not only a tremendous
feat of meticulous planning and com-

munity goodwill; it was the social
event of the year. Volunteers were
treated to snacks and lunch and T-
shirts were awarded by lottery
throughout the day. Undergraduate
classes were cancelled and a huge par-
ty was held by the university for
everybody who participated in the
move.

The old McCormick Library was
renovated to become the home fo the
W&L School of Commerce,
Economics and Politics, while the new
library provided the much needed
space and physical capabilities that
were critically needed.

On Tuesday, the library held an
open house celebrating its 10th birth-
day. Refreshments were served in the
main lobby throughout the day.

Harassment policy

finalized

By Heather M. Midkiff
Staff Reporter

 

 

The Confidential Review Com-
mittee (CRC) has composed its policy
on harassment at Washington and
Lee.

The CRC deals with any case of
**Ethnic, racial, religious, or sexual
nature that has the purpose or effect of
substantially or unreasonably interfer-
ing with an individual’s work or edu-
cational performance; of creating an
intimidating, hostile, or offensive en-
vironment for work or learning; or of
adversely affecting an individual's
quality of life.”

Sexual harassment, which appears
to be the most obscure form of
harassment, can include anything

Students for Minority and Interna-
tional Student Affairs, Dean Mc-
Cloud.

McCloud emphasizes that ‘*No ac-
tions will be taken without the ap-
proval of the alleged victim. A person
who feels she/he has been victimized
may just come over and talk about it; I
can explain the options possible. "”

The options possible for taking ac-
tion against an offender range in se-
verity, depending on the incident. A
student may choose to resolve the
problem in a consultation with the
accused and McCloud, or take the
case to the CRC. At any point in time,
the victim has the option to discon-
tinue the process.

If the case is submitted to the CRC,
it will be handled with discretion ac-
cording to the rules the CRC has set

 

Sexual harassment can include anything
from ‘‘so-called ‘teasing,’ sexual innuen-
dos, and bullying of a sexist nature,’’ to
‘‘explicit sexual harassment...”
-Association of American Colleges

 

from *‘so-called ‘teasing,’ sexual in-
nuendos, and bullying of a_ sexist
nature, both physical and verbal,”’ to
“explicit sexual harassment up to and
including sexual aggression,’’ as
defined in an article put forth by the
Association of American Colleges.

This type of harassment can also en-
tail offensive jokes, objectionable pic-
tures in a public place, remarks about
someone’s body, unwanted touching
or kissing, persistent sexual attention,
requests for sexual activity and
obscene telephone messages.

According to the policy of the CRC,
**An individual who feels that he/she
has been the victim of ethnic, racial,
religious and/or sexual harassment is
urged to consult, as soon as possible
after the incident has occurred, the
Associate Dean of Students for
Minority and International Student
Affairs, a member of the University
Counseling Service, the Associate
the Dean of Students’ staff, a dor-
mitory counselor or a_ peer
counselor. ”’
counselor. ””

If the victim agrees, the incident
shall be taken to the Associate Dean of

up. The complainant and the accused
will be notified that the incident has
been referred to the CRC. After the
CRC reviews written statements of the
incident as described by both the
accused and the complianant and a
summary of the investigation, it will
hold a hearing approximately one
week later.

During the hearing, both the com-
plainant and the accused may be ac-
companied by an advisor from the
University community. The com-
plainant, the accused and t heir respec-
tive advisors may listen to the
testimony; however, all testimony and
written statements are confidential.
The accused and the complainant will
be notified of the CRC’s decision as
soon as possible.

McCloud encourages any students
with further questions to come and
talk with her; she will also answer
questions concerning procedures for
claims of students against faculty
members.

“All of this is for the purpose of
creating a campus environment in
which ALL STUDENTS, regardless
of gender, race or religion, can feel
comfortable,’’ said McCloud.

How do you feel about the following argument:

(1) It is illegal to consume/possess alcohol under the age of 21.
(2) It is an honor violation to break the law.

(3) Therefore, it is an honor violation to consume/possess alcohol under the age of 21.

Nicole Oden °91, Tampa, FL—I
don’t think W&L should dictate the
law to us. It is up to us as responsible
college students to decide whether or
not to drink. It is the same as an HV

Hal Bailey °91, Memphis, TN—I
don’t feel the administration has the

not. By consuming alcohol, we are not
lying about being 21. That is BS!

Eddy Klank °89, Memphis,

Staff Report

 

A series of lectures and discus-
sions will highlight Drug Awareness
Week at Washington and Lee Univer
sity Jan. 16-20

Two keynote lectures will be given
by Nelson M. Butters, chief of psy
chology services at the San Diego VA
Medical Center and professor of
psychiatry at the University of
California School of Medicine (San
Diego). During the past 20 years,
Butters has focused much of his
research on the chronic effects of
ethanol on memory and other
cognitive functions and has published
extensively on the subject.

On Tuesday, Jan. 17, a panel pro-
gram on drug information and edu-
cation will be presented in Lee Chapel
at 7:30 p.m. Members of the panel

will include U.S. Circuit Judge
George E. Honts, criminal in-
vestigator Doug Orbaugh, drug

counselor Marilyn Claytor and a
recovering student. The program is
open to the public.

Butters will present lectures on
Wednesday and Thursday, Jan. 18
and 19. Both are open to the public.

Butters received his A.B. degree
from Boston University in 1960, and
master’s and doctorate degrees from
Clark University. He is a licensed
psychologist, a Diplomate in Clinical
Neuropsychology (American Board of
Clinical Neuropsychology, American
Board of Professional Psychology),
and a member of the American Board
of Clinical Neuropsychology.

Prior to joining the staff at the San
Diego VA Medical Center, Butters
taught at Clark University, Nor-
theastern University, and Boston Uni-
versity School of Medicine. From
1967-1983, he served as a research

said, the university wants to revitalize
the fraternity system.

‘Fraternities too often represent
negative values,”’ said Touchton, rep-
resenting the board of trustees. With
this program, he said, **Fraternities
will be positive assets.”’

Construction can start as soon as
spring of 1990, said Atkins. Most of
the construction will take place in the
summer, using the spring term only if
it is necessary, said Wilson. When
asked where members will live and
chapters will meet, Wilson said,
‘That question has not been address-
ed yet, but provisions will be made.”’

Nicaraguan resistance leader
Adolfo Calero will speak at Washing-
ton and Lee University at 7:30 p.m.
Wednesday, Jan. 18, in Lee Chapel.

The lecture is sponsored by Con-
tact, a lecture series financed and ad-
ministered by a committee repre-
senting the student body.

Calero was forced into exile from
Nicaragua in 1982. Since then, he has
participated in an armed struggle to
campaign for the liberation of his
country. In 1983, he was nominated
for membership in the National Direc-
torate of the Nicaraguan Democratic
Force, where he served as president
and commander in chief. In 1985, he
joined the Directorate of the United
Nicaraguan Opposition, a position he
held until 1987, when he resigned to
serve on the Directorate of the
Assembly of the Nicaraguan
Resistance. There he represents the
Conservative political current.

Calero was born in Managua in
1931, the son of Adolfo Calero Oroz-
co, author of the historical novel
‘‘Sangre Santa.’’ He received a
degree in business administration
from the University of Notre Dame
and did post-graduate studies in in-
dustrial administration at Syracuse
University. In 1972, he received the
doctor of law degree from the Central
American University in Managua and
served there for one year as dean to
the faculty of administrative and
economic sciences.

In addition to serving on the boards
of several business enterprises in
Nicaragua, Calero worked as assistant
manager for W.R. Grace and Co.,
Central America, and as a general
manager of the Planta Embotelladora

Letter

 

(continued from page 1)

According to Elrod, Touchton
believes this is a change in the
magnitude of coeducation and it is im-
portant that everybody understand
why the board of trustees has called
for such a wide reaching program.

Elrod likened the board’s actions to
those of a loving parent. ““The parent
wants to do things for the child and if
the child cannot see the long term
benefits, then the parent will make
sure those things are done.”’

The Renaissance program will see
that each fraternity is renovated or
rebuilt with $10 million in financial
support. In trade for new houses, each
fraternity will accept and abide by
the‘‘Standards for Fraternities at
Washington and Lee University.’’ A
chapter does not have to accept the fi-
nancial support, but it will be required
to meet the housing standards. Each
chapter accepting the financial support
will have to release ownership of the
house to the university.

According to the letter, long term
benefits of the program include ‘‘a

more constructive fraternity envir-'
onment that we had just a few years ,
ago.”

Elrod said the Fraternity »
Renaissance will place a greater part
of the burden on fraternity members *
now than on those who come before or «
after.

According to Touchton’s letter, °
fraternities are an,,important part of a »
four-year college career. They pro-
vide lasting friendships, social '
benefits and leadership experience. It ,
is a responsibility of the board of
trustees, said Touchton, to provide
‘tan ‘outside the classroom’ envir- ,
ornment that is supportive of the fun-
damental academic purpose.”’ :

The letter zsked students to help the ,
university implement the program.
“It is our hope that this letter will "
cause you to begin to ask what you can ,
do to help us improve fraternities at
Washington and Lee.”’ ‘

The letter also stated that parents .
can support the board’s efforts by
‘‘reminding their students who pays *
the bills.”” .

The letter was written in advance of
Tuesday’s campus meeting in efforts «
to eliminate any questions still remain-
ing about the Fraternity Renaissance *
program. ‘

Elrod said, ‘‘In a few years, only a
handful of universities of the same *
caliber as Washington and Lee will
have as muscular a fraternity system
as Washington and Lee.”’ ‘

David A. Badertscher has
been named head of technical ser-
vices and assistant professor of
{| library science for Washington and
; | Lee University’s undergraduate
library. He assumed the position
Jan. 3.

Prior to joining the staff of the
W&L Library, Badertscher served
as acting head of serials at the Uni-
versity of Virginia, where he also
worked as serials conversion coor-
“| dinator/cataloger. He served as
technical services librarian at the
Virginia Military Institute from
July 1983 until October 1986.

Badertscher also has held posi-
tions in libraries at Jacksonville
State University, the Georgia In-
stitute of Technology, the Judicial
Council of Georgia and Vanderbilt
University. In the early 1970s, he
taught German at the secondary
school level in Atlanta and Dekalb
County, Ga.

Badertscher received his B.A.

The works of a Lexington-
born artist most noted for her
depictions of theatrical perfor-
mances and theater personalities of
the early 20th century are on
display at the law school for the
month of January, said a law
school librarian, Jack Bissett.

The paintings and sketches of
Ellen Graham Anderson, born in
1885 on- Letcher Avenue, can be
seen in the Laughlin Faculty
Lounge weekdays from 8 a.m. to 5
p.m., according to Bissett.

The 20-plus-piece exhibit in-
cludes still-lives, scenes of people
and places in Europe and several
magazine illustrations, Bissett
said. The collection also includes
an oil portrait entitled ‘‘Calvin
Coolidge in Williamsburg’’ and a
portrait of the artist’s father, who

member of the American and

time General Lee served as presi-
dent of the university (1865-1870).
Three letters from G.W. Custis
Lee, who succeeded his father as
president of Washington and Lee,
were purchased from the library
through the generosity of William
R. Hill Jr. of Richmond. The
letters, which reveal the kind and
gentle personality of Custis Lee,
were written to Col. Charles Mar-
shall, General Lee’s wartime aide.
The Baxter Family Papers were
donated to the. library by the
Misses Mary and Martha Coulling
of Williamsburg, aunts of W&L
English Professor Sidney M. Bax-
ter Coulling. The collection of ap-
proximately 300 items includes
correspondence of the family over’
three generations. Of special inter-
est to the university are letters and
papers of the Rev. George A. Bax-
ter, president of Washington Col-
lege from 1799 to 1829, and of his
wife, Anne C. Fleming Baxter.
The collection complements the
Baxter and Fleming papers, which
already are at Washington and Lee.

ed as Virginia’s attorney general,
according to Bissett.

Ellen Anderson, who died in
1970, attended the Art Students
League in New York City and later
studied at the Beaux Arts School in
Paris, said Bissett. She studied
under the French artist Guerin as
well, according to Bissett.

The outbreak of World War I
brought Anderson back to the
United States, where she worked in
New York City for 10 years,
Bissett said. Crippled by a knee in-
jury, she came back to her
childhood home on _ Letcher
Avenue and opened an art studio,
according to Bissett.

During this time, Anderson was
active in the historical society,
hospital boards and other local
groups, while she exhibited her
work in art shows throughout the
state, said Bissett.

At the end of January, the pain-
tings and sketches will be returned
to the various families who loaned
them to the school, according to
Bissett.

(continued from page 1)

Since its beginning there has been
heated debate as to whether the facul-
ty-dominated CRC has usurped stu-
dent power on campus by taking away
an important role of the Student Con-
duct Committee (SCC).

The E.C. submitted a formal pro-
posal in November for an alternate
committee to the CRC that would
change the formation of the committee
to a student majority.

On Nov.14 the faculty voted not to
look into the CRC proposals presented
to it, saying that it will review the
CRC in 1990.

In other business, freshman
Suzanne Sneed made a proposal to the
E.C. to purchase a mascot costume to
be used at university athletic events.
The E.C. said it will look into the
matter.

Senior David Burns reported on the
honor conference he attended last
year, and suggested that the E.C. look
into the possibility of using an
‘*Academic Integrity Video’’ as a way
of introducing the freshmen to the
Honor system. Burns presented ga

President Christopher deMovellan
appointed E.C. members John

look into the matter.

E.C. member Mark Cobb will at-
tend the University of Richmond
Honor Conference during the Wash-

ington break. :
Additionally, senior Michael

Tuggle, eatertainment editor of the
Ring-tum Phi, requested that the E.C.
allocate money to fund a special
supplement to the Phi that will reflect
upon the last four years of co-
education. The supplement would
allow seniors and faculty to write
letters representing their views on the
subject.

The supplement will be an attempt
to ‘‘put a cap on the co-education
argument which has been brewing for
four years,’’ said Tuggle.

The E.C. voted to postpone its deci-
sion until it contacts the Publications
Board.

Senior Jim Cobb, chairman of
S.A.M.S (Students against Multiple
Sclerosis), petitioned the E.C. for
$200 to be offered as a prize in the an-
nual M.S. Lip Synch contest. The
E.C. voted 12-0-0 in favor of the re-
quest.

The meeting lasted for approximate-
ly 50 minutes.

ties at W&L could use sober drivers.

Live Drive will operate for any
social event that involoves Washing-
ton and Lee University students. but
the group needs to have two weeks
notice. Fialcowitz said the advance
time is needed in order to schedule
drivers and obtain vans.

The Live Drive program can be
used for private fraternity functions as
well. Sapp said that a few fraternities
have used Live Drive in this capacity.

A general meeting for the organiza-
tion will be held Wednesday at 7 p.m.

Generals, Maroons set to renew rivalry

Wa&L captures Invitational

By Jay Plotkin
Staff Reporter

 

After a 29-day layoff, the Washing
ton and Lee basketball team returned
to the court as host of the 1989 W&l
Invitational, and rang in the new year
with wins over Elmira and Mount St
Mary to come away with the cham
pionship

Against Elmira last Thursday night
in the Warner Center, head coach
Verne Canfield knew his team would
be a little bit rusty. But what he and a
crowd of approximately 500 people
was beyond rusty. After the
game, Canfield said, ‘‘l am totally
dissatisfied with that effort. That is
terrible basketball.”’

In the first half, Canfield benched
some starters and went with reserves.
His reasoning was defense. **That is
probably the worst defense I have seen
a team play, and that is intolerable.
Some starters [found themselves] on
the bench in the first half because they
didn’t play team defense.”’

Although the Generals escaped with
an 85-78 decision, the statistics tell the
story. In the second half, W&L shot
an anemic 38 percent from the field
(12-31) while Elmira shot 42 percent
(14-33). The Generals shot 27 of 42
from the foul line, for 64 percent.
W&L turned the ball over 19 times,
while Elmira couldn’t keep its hands
on the ball either, racking up 27 turn-

SPORTS NOTEBOOK

overs

Canfield, found
relief in the play of the reserves,
namely sophomores Scott Alrutz, who
finished with four points, and Andrew
Manson. ‘‘I thought a couple of kids
came off the bench and played some
good, hustling, scrapping basketball,
and that’s Andy Scott." On
several occasions, Manson dove to
cover loose balls and knocked a ball
away from an Elmira player by diving
in the backcourt

Once again, sophomore — center
Chris Jacobs paced the Generals at
tack, finishing with 21 points and 12
rebounds. Classmates Mike Holton
and Craig Hatfield also had big games
with 19 and 18 points respectively
Senior captain Lee Brading chipped in
with 10.

For Elmira, seniors Rick Parker and
Bob Marko led the way. Parker
poured in a game-high 23 points,
while Marko notched 17 points and 13
boards.

In the final game of the tournament
on Saturday, the Generals played
Mount St. Mary, a 95-70 loser to
Elmira on Friday night. W&L got off
to an ominous start as the Knights
quickly scored the first eight points of
the game before Jacobs netted the first
W&L tally

The Washington and Lee wrestling
team suffered through a Saturday that
was as tough for the squad as getting
up for classes that morning was for a
majority of the student body. The
Generals lost both of their meets in the
Hopkins Quadrangular, held Jan. 7 in
Baltimore. The first match, against
the event's host, Johns Hopkins, was a
32-11 defeat; and the second match
was equally rough, a 39-13 loss to
Western Maryland.

Against Hopkins the Generals
began with Scott Swygert being pinn
ed, setting the team behind 6-0. Soph-

women are 3-0. The Generals travel to
Pennsylvania for dual meets with

MIKE SHADY’
What the heck
is a Maroon?

There are several things that are easy to do in this world of ours.
Chewing gum and walking at the same time. Watching MTV’s ‘‘Remote
Control’. Watching that girl in the tight pants and cut-off shirt on
“Remote Control."* And, possibly, understanding all the fuss about
sororities coming to W&L (Nope. Scratch that. One can never
understand what THAT is all about.).

What most people would say it is definitely NOT easy to get very ex-
cited over a W&L athletic event. Who cares, anyway? Apathy abounds
here in the land of Polo shirts and BMW’s. Except when the dreaded
Roanoke Maroons come to town to face the Generals’ basketball team.

What's the big deal? What’s all the hubbub, bub? I mean, there aren’t
any huge cash prizes or trophies at stake, are there? It isn’t like
Louisville/Kentucky where a recruiting successes and woes hinge on the
outcome of the contest. And, by the way, what’s a Maroon?

Now this may seem silly and nonsensical to all you (y’all?) freshmen
and first-year attenders here at W&L. ‘‘It’s just a game!”’ you say.
‘‘Why should a meaningless basketball game be so important?”’

Well, it’s not like this little shindig just started yesterday. Seventy-
nine years ago in 1910 the Generals defeated the Maroons 119-5. (That
wasn't a misprint. Honest) The following year was almost as lopsided.
Final score: W&L 94, RC |. But the rivalry didn’t begin with these ear-
ly hardwood embarrassments.

No, the heat was most likely turned up during the 1979-80 season,
Roanoke’s first in Division III (The Maroons were previously a Division
II power). A year later, they joined the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference. The Generals weren't supposed to beat them. But they did. In
those two years of transition, three out of the four meetings W&L came
away with victory. A rivalry was born.

Generals’ head coach Verne Canfield sees THE GAME as the rich,
preppie kids (what other school wears ‘royal’ blue?) versus the blue col-
lar types. No argument here. None of the schools in the ODAC likes
W&L for the simple reason that we come from upper middle class
backgrounds while they don’t (except for maybe Hampden-Sydney, but
we'll save their story for another day). Nobody respects the wealthy, so
if you can’t beat them with the checkbooks then beat them with the jump
hooks.

What really makes this year’s game just that little extra special has
been the crowd support for this year’s team. Apathy? False. Already the
fans have brought meaning back to the words ‘thome court advan-
tage’’(the Generals are 6-0 at home this year) and one can only speculate
if the walls of the Warner Center (i.e. ‘‘Temple of Doom’’) will come
tumbling down tonight from the decibel level.

It’s not Dallas/Washington. It’s not Boston/L.A. It’s not even
Yale/Harvard. It is, however, our rivalry. And a good one at that.

NOTES—With Notre Dame back where it belongs, all seems serene in
today’s sports world. Not so. It seems that NC State did a little creative
compromising when it came to Mr. Chris Washburn’s grades. Ah well,
we can’t all maintain academic excellence... Please support the W&L
lacrosse team as well as the Generals’ basketball game tonight by pur-
chasing a *‘Terrible Towel’’ for a measly three bucks. The first 50
W&L students who enter the Warner Center tonight will receive one
free. See your local lacrosse player for details.

Generals had their first lead at 29-28.
MSM fought back behind Delor
Johnson's 18 first half points to lead
36-34, but Holton hit an off-balance
three-point goal from the corner at the
buzzer—his third trey of the half—to
send the Generals into the locker room
up 37-36.

In the second half, the Knight's
Derrick Brown scored 14 of his game-
total 15 points, including two that tied
the score at 65 with 4:47 left to play.
So the Generals again went to their
Mr. Consistency in the paint. Jacobs
responded with 22 second half points,
including nine of W&L’s last 14, and
gave the Generals the lead for good
with two free throws with 2:14 to
play. He finished with 26 points and
10 rebounds, leading the Generals to a
hard-fought 79-74 win.

Holton finished with 14, Brading

 

11, and sophomore forward Ed Hart
added 11. Johnson led MSM with 28
points and 12 rebounds.

“Our guys are showing a certain
poise at the end of the game, and if
they can do that now as sophomores,
then I’m excited to see what we can do
in two years,”’ said Canfield after the
Generals, 7-2, 3-0 in the Old Domi-
nion Athletic Conference, hit eight of
10 free throws in the final three
minutes to preserve the win.

Canfield was also pleased with the
crowd support, especially late in the
game. ‘‘I’m really pleased with that
crowd. There is nothing greater than
to hear a crowd start calling ‘defense’
when the score is tied. My hat is off to
the students supporting us like that.”’

The all-tournament team consisted
of Elmira’s Marko (41 points, 23
boards in two games), and Parker (41
points), MSM’s Johnson (48, 20), and
W&L’s Holton (33 points, 10-11 free
throws, 11 assists, seven 3-pt. goals)
and Most Valuable Player Jacobs (47,
22). wr ;

the only current General to play in that game. ‘The juniors
on that team were ecstatic. | was a freshman, and at that
time, I didn’t really know what the Roanoke game was all
about. But you could tell everyone thought it was a great
big thing to beat them. ”’

THE PAGEANTRY: Traditionally, Roanoke brings its
cheerleaders and a busload of students when it comes up
the road to Lexington, and generally, the W&L student
body has a surprise for them. A group of General sup
porters calling themselves the Unknown Fans—sporting
bags over their heads not unlike those worn by the old New
Orleans Aints’ fans—run around during time outs getting
the W&L faithful further involved in the game.

Will the Unknown Fans strike again this season? Said
one Unknown Fan, *‘We’ll try to get the wave going, read
newspapers during introductions, generally be loud and
obnoxious.”

 

Said Brading, ‘‘I think it’s great. As a player you look
forward to seeing what they will do. It's fun to watch, and
it makes playing the game more fun.”’

Said Canfield on the tradition, ‘‘I love ‘em. Great tra-
dition. I think it’s a nice, healthy situation, and I applaud
the people that do it, and am just sure to ask them to keep
everything in good taste. I would miss them if they weren't
here. I love them. I think it’s great, and I want Roanoke to
worry about the fact that the Unknown Fans are coming in.

THE PLACE: Lexington, Virginia. The Warner
Center. Sources close to the athletic department have
started a rumor that the Warner Center is about to undergo
a name change, mainly due to the fact that two preseason
conference favorites and the preseason fifth ranked team in
the nation have come to Lexington only to leave with their
rankings between their legs. The new name? The Temple
Of Doom. It has meant doom for every team that has come
to play here at W&L this season. ~

Holiday comedies surprise

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

Christmas is by far the busiest
season for new films (with maybe the
exception of summer) and this year’s
Christmas was no exception churning
out film after film after film. While
the season wasn’t quite exceptional,
the films released were.

For the first time in some years,
most of the films released for the
Christmas holidays were met with
great reviews. The hilarious comedy
Twins starring Danny DeVito and Ar-
nold Schwarzeneggar, Working Girl
starring Harrison Ford, Melanie
Griffith and Sigourney Weaver, The
Naked Gun starring Leslie Nielsen
and Priscilla Presley and two new
animated films, The Land Before Time
from Don Bluth and Steven Spielberg
and Oliver and Company from Disney
helped lead the way to one of the best
box office takes in years.

There is no question, however, that
Mississippi Burning and Rain Man
were the finest two films released over
the holiday and the ones that will lead
this years group of films into the
Academy Award ceremonies in April.
I'll review the two films in the coming
weeks but this week I want to focus on
two of the season’s big comedy hits.

Bill Murray has been a little quiet
since Ghostbusters but not anymore.
His refreshed version of Dickens’ A
Christmas Carol called Scrooged is a
quality, light modernization on the old
story. Having been exposed to every
cinematic and television version of
Dickens’ story possible from an
animated version to a children’s ver-

you

sion to numerous film versions (and
having nightmares that the California
raisins might try to pull one off), I was
skeptical about seeing the film, but
was pleasantly surprised with the
result.

Murray gives a very
‘*Murrayesque”’ performance full of
the mannerisms, expressions and
vocalizations that have established
him as one of Hollywood’s biggest
comedig draws since he finished his
run on Saturday Night Live in the
70’s. Buster Poindexter and Carol
Kane are wonderful as the ghosts of
Christmas past and present and stand
out in what is an all-star cast including
Bob Goldthwait, John Forsythe,
Karen Allen, Mary Lou Retton, Alfre
Woodard, Robert Mitchum, Buddy
Hackett and John Houseman and Anne
Ramsey in what were their last film
appearances.

The story revolves around a cable
network executive (Murray) who has
worked his way to the top by looking
out for himself and stepping on
anyone in the way. His network has
plans to show a live version of A
Christmas Carol on Christmas Eve
using Hackett as Scrooge, Retton as
Tiny Tim and the Solid Gold dancers
as a chorus.

As Murray makes plans for the pro-
duction and gives his Christmas pre-
sent order to his secretary, ‘‘Towel,
towel, VCR (for the corporate
manager)’’ his life begins to assume
that of his production but like all
Scrooges, he never realizes that what
is happening is really happening to
him until the end.

Scroogedis very light and quite en-
joyable. It isn’t the best film of the
season, but for what it tried to ac-

complish, it succeeded with few
Humbugs from the critics.

TUG'S TAG - &&*®

Speaking of Ghostbusters stars who
need a little boost, how about Dan
Ackroyd? After the disastrous The
Great Outdoors this summer,
Ackryod was definitely asking Santa
for a successful Christmas and a suc-
cessful Christmas is what he got.

My Stepmother is an Alien has been
the surprise hit of the Christmas
season combining the talents of
Ackroyd, Jon Lovitz and Kim
Basinger; and oh, are they talented.

The film centers around Basinger
who comes to earth from a distant
galaxy to investigate a laser beam that
physicist Ackroyd sent accidently hit-
ting her galaxy. Basinger is sent to
find out why since Ackroyd was ap-
parently thousands of years ahead of
his time in sending the beam that far.

What ensues is a very funny and
refreshing romp through alien edu-
cation. Basinger comes equipped with
a purse called ‘‘bag’’ that knows
everything and can explain it to
Basinger when she _ encounters
something she doesn’t know such as
kissing, sex and marriage. Each of the
education scenes are incredibly funny
and very entertaining.

As for performances, all are ex-
cellent. Ackroyd pulls off his usual
geeky, intellectual, sexually deprived
character with ease and with style. He
continues to be, like Murray and many
of the others from the original Satur-
day Night Live, one of the finest com-
edians in film today. Ackroyd has that
rare ability to portray a character who

goes through life with reckless
disabandon without ever losing total
control.

If there is one comedian who is
coming into his own in film right now
it is Jon Lovitz. There is no question
that if someone is directing a film and
they have a part for the ultimate
cheeseball, Lovitz is the man. After
creating the characters such as the
agreeable man who says ‘‘yeah, that’s
the ticket’’ and the news correspon-
dent who urges the audience to ‘‘get to
know me’’ on the current Saturday
Night Live shows, Lovitz has put
himself in great demand. There is no
question, however, that this is his
finest film role to date. His scene at
the end of the film is priceless.

And while we are talking about
priceless, why not mention Kim
Basinger, one of the hottest properties
in Hollywood and definitely one of
the hottest actresses on the screen to-
day. This Athens, Georgia beauty has
come a long way since hitting
Hollywood in the seventies. Though
she has done numerous films she is
probably best remembered for her
part in 9 //2 Weeks opposite Mickey
O’Rouke; most especially the dance
scene in white. If you think that was
something, then don’t miss My Step-
mother is an Alien because she tops
her 9 //2 Weeks performance hands
down.

My Stepmother is an Alien will sur-
prise you. It doesn’t have the most in-
tricate or intelligent plot in the world
but it’s a cute film and one that has
more than enough laughs to justify the
$4 ticket price.

DK inducts 21

Honor fraternity recognizes leaders

 

By Chris Barade
Staff Reporter

 

Omicron Delta Kappa, the national
honorary fraternity started here at
Washington and Lee in 1914 by a
group of twelve students, will tap 21
students and two honorary members
as part of the Founders Day celebra-
tion today. ODK is an organization
that seeks to recognize superior
leaders within the university, and in
the words of current ODK president
Marion ‘‘Moose’’ Herring, ‘‘It gets
campus leaders together to talk about
campus activities. ””

The names of the 21 new members
are a closely guarded secret, and
although the new members have
known who they are since Christmas,
they are not revealed publicly until the
actual ceremony today. The two
honorary members are William R.
Johnston, a 1961 graduate of W&L,
and Donald H. Baker, who was a
member of the Class of 1968.

Johnston is chairman of the board

and CEO of Agora Securities, Inc., in
New York, a member of the Wall

Street Club and executive vice presi-
dent and director of the Cancer
Research and Teaching Fund.

Baker is artistic director for Lime
Kiln Arts Inc., the center for the arts

EC mulls
CRC rules,
P.E.credits

By Genienne Mongno
Staff Reporter

 

The Executive Committee reported
Monday night that the EC sub-
committee's discussion with Professor
Samuel J. Kozak about the E.C’s con-
cerns with the recently released Con-
fidential Review Committee (CRC)
Procedures was successful.

The E.C appointed the — sub-
committee, which met last Tuesday
with Kozak, who is head of the CRC,
because it had several questions con-
cerning the constitutionality of some
of the procedures

Specifically, the E.C. was worried
that the procedures did not allow for
cross-examination of the complainant
during a hearing, thereby infringing
on the right of those involved to due
process of law.

The sub-committee, which con-
sisted of E.C. Members Dan DuPre
and Dave Nave and E.C. Secretary
Eddie Yu, told Kozak that they
believed there needed to be a way for
students involved in a CRC hearing to
challenge what the witnesses say

Kozak said that although many of
the E.C.’s concerns with constitu-
tional problems were not valid in the
case of a CRC hearing, he would ac
cept a set of proposed guidelines for
the questioning of the accused.

DuPre said he would draft the
guidelines
In other business, E.C. President

Christopher deMovellan reported that
many W&L athletes are upset because
beginning next year they will only be
receiving one-fifth of a physical edu-
cation (P.E.) credit tor their participa-
tion in inter- collegiate sports. Cur-
rently the athletes receive two-fifths of
a credit

The new rule is meant to ensure that
an athlete will have to take a variety of
sports to satisfy his/her P.E. require
ment, said deMovellan.

deMovellan said he plans to talk
with Dean John Elrod and the Athletic
Committee about an alternate proposal
that will allow each athlete to receive
one credit for each inter- collegiate

sport played.

The E.C. also went over the
guideline reports of various organiza-
tions, submitted by E.C. Members

Kovesci said since coeducation has reduced the number of in-

Total opening enrollment for the fall
of 1988 increased an additional 3.5
percent to a record of 1,990. Combin-
ed with the lowest attrition rate ever; 3
percent, Washington and Lee con-
tinues to grow larger.

‘These statistics are part of an annual
report produced by the Registrars’ of-
fice. The report covers everything
from enrollment trends to number of
courses taught to number of degrees
awarded.

Some of the highlights for the 1987-
88 school year include: the percentage
of undergraduate grades of A or B
reached 67 percent for the first time
and failing grades reached a 25-year
low of 2.4 percent; the percentage of
graduates receiving honors was the
lowest in 17 years for undergraduates;
and 96 percent of the Class of °91
returned for their sophomore year.

Statistics found in the report provide
a look at what the average W&L stu-
dent is like. Of course, this represen-
tation is merely the highest percentage
of each category. A typical student

enrolling in 1988-89 is white, 94.3
percent (minorities-4.9 percent); with
no religious preference, 39 percent,
(Catholic-16.7 percent); from
Virginia, 413 students, (Maryland-
160); and majoring in history, 158
students or 18 percent, (economics-
113 students or 13 percent).

The report also points out that for
the size of W&L, the school offers
quite a few courses; in last year the
university offered 740 courses in
1 064 sections.

Of these courses, Calculus 101 was
the singular most popular class with
301 students enrolling. For those
students interested, Chinese provided
the most A+ grades with 28.1 per-
cent of all grades given out in ’87-°88.
Drama came in second with 13.2 per-
cent. Russian on the other hand, gave
out an F 10 percent of the time. Math
was a Close second with 8.7 percent of
the time.

Finally, if you've wondered just
where some of your classmates have
gone, 83 percent of the original Class
of °89 are still here, 89 percent of the
Class of °90, and 96 percent of the
Class of ‘91.

MSA celebrates King

By Tina Vandersteel
Staff Reporter

 

All around the nation Sunday, the
Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was
remembered from the pulpit by fellow
clergymen on what would have been
the civil rights leader's 60th birthday

In Lexington, **Words and Music in
Celebration of the Life of Martin
Luther King Jr.’° was the theme of
this year’s Washington and Lee
Minority Student Association pro
gram, which took place Monday night
at the First Baptist Church on Main
Street

Lovida H. Coleman Jr
ton, D.C. lawyer whose — father
worked with King, recounted what
King’s life meant to her. The W&I
Glee Club and others sang spiritual
music at points throughout the hour-
and-a-half-long program

Coleman, speaking to an almost full
church, talked about the dedication,
accomplishments and *‘ultimate
sacrifice” of King. She described her

Seeing only one hand raised, Col-
eman said to the woman who stood
toward the back of the church, “It's

Coleman also took a firm stand for
affirmative action during her speech,
saying that a ‘‘more perfect union,”’
as is called for in the preamble to the
Constitution, could be achieved if
people would stop interpreting the
Constitution in terms of individual
rights

“This interpretation is rigid, un
imaginative and incorrect,’* she said,

before further justifying affirmative
action. Her final arguments came
from a quote from King, ** What helps

OPINION

Recognizing
male issues

Issues concerning the rights of women have pervaded the intellec-
tual climate of America throughout the 1980's. Date rape, abortion,
comparable worth, alimony and other female-sensitive topics have
been covered heavily by media, ranging from best selling books to
talk-shows. Everyone knows about female issues. They come up in
presidential debates, in the senate, in the courts, in civic meetings,
and in family debates. But what about men’s issues? If you’re the
average American citizen you probably never even heard of them.
You probably never heard of a 59-year-old Madison, Wisconsin,
resident named Roy Schenk either.

Schenk, who holds a masters degree from Columbia University,
has written two books on male issues (The Other Side of the Coin
and We’ve Been Had) and is the inventor of the ‘‘Dating Contract’’
which has been sent to college newspapers. He became interested in
men’s issues during the 1960’s when he first came into contact with
feminists who, according to Schenk, wanted the benefits of equal
rights but not the responsibility that comes with it. During a recent
telephone interview, Schenk explained to me his beliefs concerning
relationships between members of the opposite sex. -*

Schenk believes that women enjoy a psychological advantage
over men by introducing into the male subconscious a ‘‘shame of
maleness.’’ According to Schenk’s theory, women make men feel
inferior by establishing themselves as authorities in areas of per-
sonal behavior and hygiene. He believes that this socialization pro-
cess of ‘‘male shame’’ begins with young boys and their mothers
who force female values such as cleanliness on their sons. The fact
that the vast majority of advice columnists like Ann Landers, are
women is evidence to Schenk that women occupy this position of
superiority which leads to the unfair treatment of men by society.
Schenk furnished a few examples of what he believes is unfair
treatment of the male species:

We place less value on the life of men: 1) men - no women - go to
combat during war. Currently, 18-year-old men are required to
register for selective service, while women are exempt.

2) The percentage of female murderers who get the death penalty
is substantially lower than that of male murderers.

3) Men are expected to take riskier jobs than their female
counterparts. Of the approximately 7,000 people killed on the job
last year, over 6,000 were men.

Divorce and Custody:

Courts maintain a pro-female attitude in custody battles. While
men are usually punished for withholding child support payments,

women are rarely punished for denying their former husbands
court-prescribed visitation rights.

Dating is another area where Schenk feels men are treated unfair-
ly. Because men are no longer the sole wage earners, he thinks it is
unfair that they should be expected to pay for dutes. Any woman
who expects the man to pay is using ‘‘her sexuality to gain
something of significant monetary value’’ and, according to
Schenk, has entered an implied contract of prostitution. He believes
that this implied contract is a major source of date rape. In other
words, the male participant financially responsible for the date also
feels entitled to a sexual relationship.

Schenk believes another source of date rape stems from what he
calls Pre-Coital Stress Syndrome (PCS). PCS occurs when a man is
aroused during ‘‘intense sexual foreplay’’ to a point that he is com-
pelled to proceed even if the female resists. In Schenk’s opinion,
Pre-Coital Stress Syndrome is the male equivalent to the female’s
Pre-Menstrual Syndrome.

Therefore, he thinks it is sexist to condemn men who act inap-
propriately under the stress of PCS and commit date rape while ex-
cusing the violent acts committed by women under the stress of
PMS. Schenk believes dating contracts like the one reprinted on this

that if either party (male or female) is giving a significant amount of

time or money to the dating relationship, then that person, if they

desire, has the right to be compensated sexually. And naturally if
the parties split the cost of dating, then there is no sexual obligation
for either party.

Schenk’s dating contract was the subject of a recent Phil Donahue
talk show. He says the responses to the show have been very
positive: 250 people, 30 percent of whom are women, have re-

quested a contract and only eight people have responded negatively. »

Schenk describes these critics as either fundamentalist Christians or
MIFFS (Myopic Intolerant Fanatical Feminists).

Whether or not you agree with all of Schenk’s beliefs, you have "3
to admit that he brings up some very good points. The era of a.

man’s movement is fast approaching. While many characterize

Schenk as a chauvinist, he believes he is working towards true

equality between the sexes.

At Washington & Lee, the administration has gone out of its way |
to make students aware of female issues. Last year’s freshman °

class, for example, was required to attend a film and seminar on °

date rape. Perhaps in the future the administration will give male
issues some deserved coverage.

Spiritual commitment essential to tradition

To the Student Body:

In my fifteen years of affiliation with Washing-
ton and Lee, I have often heard it said that
“‘tradition’’ is something integral and essential to
the greatness of our University. We have tradi-
tions of academic and athletic’ success, of the
Honor System, of student self-government, of
fraternities, and others. In the last few years,
however, I have heard students wondering about
some traditions that have apparently been under
closer inspection by the Administration. But none
of that is new.

While president of Washington College, Robert
E. Lee also tampered with a few hallowed tradi-
tions: he did away with a written code of conduct
and eliminated compulsory daily attendance in the
newly completed chapel. Yet honor did not erode
and attendance remained stable at the morning
prayer services.

During the fall term, several area churches and
campus ministers have attempted to rekindle the
tradition of communal Christian worship in the
Chapel by offering prayer services at 8 a.m. on
Wednesday mornings. The services, lasting twen-
ty minutes, will continue to be offered this term.
They have been sparsely attended -- this is at
times frustrating, but not discoyraging, for
“*.,,.whenever two or more are gathered...’’ At
the same time, I wonder whether the early hour
may be a bit ‘‘ungodly’’ for some, or whether
Christians today feel no spiritual need to pray as
part of a community? I also wonder what our Ad-
ministration has done to facilitate spiritual in-
quiry, discussion, and growth, as part of the Uni-

versity’s commitment to providing liberal arts ed-
ucation?

The late Thomas Merton once wrote that at a
university, one should be ‘‘...learning who one is,
and learning what one has to offer to the contem-
porary world, and then learning how to make that
offering valid.’’ The function of the university, he
continued, is to ‘‘...help men and women save
their souls, and in so doing to save their society.”’
Washington and Lee’s formal statement of institu-
tional philosophy, on page 10 in the Catalogue, is
quite similar. But are we doing all we can in learn-
ing and discovering who we are, or are we con-
cerned solely in getting the good job and making
big bucks?

In today’s cultural milieu, it appears that career
choices and individual careerism are the important
issues for students,-and W&L’s Office of Career
Development and Placement is doing an outstan-
ding job of advising, placing and guiding
students. For those students with emotional or
psychological concerns, the Dean of Students’ Of-
fice assists in counseling. Each student has a fa-
culty advisor who guides academic decisions, and
the Student Health Center handles issues of
health. However, why is there no one on this
campus, such as a Chaplain, to offer spiritual
guidance? Is this because it is just not being
offered, or is it because today’s college student
does not need or want to develop any spiritual
awareness?

There are many religious groups on campus,

the FCA, TVCF, Lampost, and others which

might benefit from the coordination and assistance

provided by a Chaplain’s office. A functioning
and active Chaplaincy, sponsoring religious and
ethical forums, would stimulate dialogue and in-
quiry into community issues and global concerns.
Interdenominational dialogue would be enhanced
among the various Western religious traditions, as
well as those of Asia. A Chaplain primarily
oriented toward the university community would
also be able to provide spiritual direction that may
or may not be available from the local churches.

If you, the members of the student body,
believe that your spiritual needs are not being ad-
dressed as part of your campus life, I urge you to
mention this fact to one of the Deans while the
University Self-Study and Long Range Planning
is winding down.

Washington and Lee is now enjoying a ‘‘Golden
Age’’: we have the best and brightest students
from all over the country, a dedicated and gifted
faculty, a physical beauty that will only be
enhanced by the new theatre and the rebuilding of
our fraternity houses, and alumni support that is
growing annually. We are in better shape mate-
rially than ever before. And yet I wonder, will we
be able to sustain all this if we neglect to do some
soul-searching and nourish the spiritual beauty
that has enriched our traditions for over two cen-
turies, and our society as a whole? I believe that
your views in identifying the spiritual needs of the
community are vitally important in planning for
the next generation of students. Do you agree?

Contact pays questionable speakers

Dear Editor:

Money talks. Lots of money brings speakers
like G. Gordon Liddy and Adolpho Calero to the
campus. Students at a university should be expos-
ed to divergent views. As a matter of the prudent
use of resources, however, it seems to me that
some thought should be given to where an au-
dience is likely to be on a point before hiring
criminals to come in and give lectures reinforcing

the arrogantly comfortable view of the world
already held by most of that audience. If the
CONTACT lecture series had done this, it is
doubtful Mr. Calero would have been selected.
The right of CONTACT to bring Calero here is
not at issue. The wisdom of that choice certainly
is. The News-Gazette issue reporting the schedul-
ing of Calero, also carried an article about a
young man who had lived and worked in
Nicaragua with Habitat for Humanity. It would

have been better for truth, for education, and for
justice if CONTACT had asked him to speak
without charge, but with the understanding that
the fat fee that will unfortunately be paid Calero
be diverted instead to help the civilian victims of
his ‘‘freedom fighters.’” That would have been a
neat idea.

Student finds sorority rush session insulting

In an attempt to keep an open mind about the
addition of sororities to the W&L campus, I at-
tended the Rush Information Session last week. I
must say that what I found surprised and, yes,
shocked me. If I had any doubts about sorority
rush, this particular presentation was not one to
relieve them.

I certainly do not mean to be disrespectful, but I
found the entire program to be an insult to the

W&L woman’s intelligence. Those who attended
will remember being told, in great detail, how to
pick out a ‘‘nice’’ outfit and how to present
oneself properly. I was not pleased to hear that an
individual is more attractive to one sorority if she
happens to be the legacy of a different sorority. I
was under the impression that this was an equal
opportunity for all W&L women. I have also
heard many women express the opinion that

waiting by your phone to be told on bid night you
will not be receiving a bid is not the most tactful
option.

In the future, I hope that these information ses-
sions will be upgraded to the quality level that all
WA&L students deserve.

OPINION

 

Dear Editor:

In response to Dr. William Lad Ses-
sion’s argument on the honor code and
the law, I contend that his argument is
based on a faulty premise. In sum-
mary, his argument states, (1), it is il-
legal to consume/possess alcohol
under the age of 21; (2) it is an honor
violation to break the law; (3)
therefore, it is an honor violation to
consume/possess alcohol under the
age of 21. First, assuming that Gen-
eral Lee personifies our-concept of
honor, unlawfulness cannot be a
honor violation per se. If unlawfulness
is dishonorable, then General Lee
would have breached our concept of
honor upon taking command of the
forces of the rebellion. Additionally,
General Washington broke British
laws, the law of his former country,
during the American Revolution.
Thus, I contend that the honor code
does not stress lawfulness.

Second, the spirit of the honor code
embodies General Lee’s statement
that ‘‘all students are to conduct them-
selves like gentlemen.’’ The rest of an
Aristotelian argument proceeds as
follows: some gentlemen drink and
some gentlemen do not drink, thus, all
gentlemen who drink do not violate
the honor code.

In my opinion, the honor code
should not concern itself with laws,
but rather with comraderie. Original-
ly, Lee’s mission for this institution
was to graduate gentlemen for the
purpose of rebuilding the South. Also,
the University was to remain a student
run institution. Thus, I contend that a
consensus of opinion among the
students ought to dictate University
policy so long as graduates remain
productive members of this country.
Standard and Poor’s found that W&L
graduates provide a_ significant
percentage (8th out of 430 collegiate
institutions) of top executives in major
American business firms. Sandi
Dudley’s interviews from
‘*Talkback’’ show that a sample of
students unanimously agree that the
honor code should not apply to under
age drinking. Taking these facts into
consideration, it’s obvious that the
honor code should not apply to under
age drinking.

- I may be wrong about this, but it
seems to me that the Administration
has used the honor code against the
students to enforce their rules. In the
process, the administration has
diminished the value of this Univer-
sity’s diploma. Fraternity rush regula-
tions are a perfect example of this. In
theory, the Interfraternity Council
plans rush. In practice, however, the
Interfraternity Council is a reactionary
committee. The administration tells
fraternities to follow their rules, and
mandates that fraternities police each
other. Coercion forces submission. To

Dr. Session’s point of
view, ‘‘it’s dishonorable to shun ’offi-
cial’ policy.’’ I speculate that the ad-
ministration’s coercive efforts are
often successful because they hold the
honor code over the heads of frater-
nities.

Tragically, the administration has
taken the planning function away from
fraternities and discouraged them
from solving their own problems.
More often than not, I hear fraternity
members talking about what solutions
the administration will approve, in-
stead of their own solutions. The
message to the fraternities is clear:
keep the lid on; the messenger with
bad news will be shot. Case in point,
the administration hung Delta Tau
Delta for a summer rush violation
without a trial.

I believe that the intentions of the
administration are good. However, I
am afraid that the administration is go-
ing to shoot itself in the foot. Planning
and problem solving are key executive
skills. Fraternities are a management

_ proving ground. I fear that taking

these executive skills out of the hands
of fraternity members will diminish
the effectiveness of graduates in the
real world,

To remedy this situation, I believe
the administration needs to imbue
students with General Lee’s concept
of honor - ‘‘all students shall conduct
themselves like gentlemen.’’ Passing
unpopular laws and rules is not effec-
tive. Shared values, on the other hand,
like honor and fraternity life, bind
together the fabric of all successful,
enduring institution. Values act as tie
breaker in gray situations. Laws
delineate black and white. Life, in
general, is gray. Likewise, life at
W&L is gray. Consequently, instead
of passing rules piecemeal, one by
one, if the administration could imbue
students with General Lee’s concept
of honor, a lot of other problems
might begin to fall of their own
weight.

Very respectfully,
Mark A. Robertson

_ Students respond to
Sessions’ views on law and honor

 

 

To the Editors:

I would like to respond to Professor
Sessions argument that ‘‘it is
dishonorable to knowingly break the
law’’ and that consequently ‘‘any
W&L student under 21 who pur-
chases, possesses or consumes any
alcoholic beverage is dishonorable.”
Professor Sessions says that he would
be pleased to learn from the readers of
the Phi how they would ‘‘deal’’ with
this argument.

What Prof. Sessions’ ‘‘argument’’
lacks is a basic understanding of the
purposes of the law and what is meant
by honorable. The law is a conduct-
regulating device, not an instrument to
define moral or honorable standards.
An honorable person is one who
adheres to a certain moral standard of
conduct, which may or may not be in
accord with the law’s provisions.

It is no more dishonorable to know-
ingly consume alcohol while under 21
than it is to knowingly park your car
illegally. Both are illegal. Yet no one
would sanction expulsion for receiv-
ing one of Murph’s calling cards.

I understand that the end result of
my argument is that it is not necessari-
ly dishonorable to break the law. But
isn’t this what Christ, Ghandi, and
Martin Luther King, Jr. coricluded
also?

Donald Schultz
Law ’89

To the Editors:
I would like to respond to Professor
Sessions’ letter concerning under-age
consumption of alcohol which ap-
peared in your most recent issue. Pro-
fessor Sessions opens his argument by
stating that ‘‘it is dishonorable know-
ingly to break the law.’’ He then states
that all W&L students know that it is
illegal to ‘‘purchase, possess, or con-
sume”’ alcohol if one is under age 21.
Based on the above statements, Ses-
sions concludes that ‘‘any W&L stu-
dent who purchases, possesses, or
consumes any. alcoholic beverage is
dishonorable. ’’
There are at least two ways to dis-
count Sessions’ entire argument and
therefore his conclusion as well. Both
of these methods center around his
first statement: ‘‘it is dishonorable
knowingly to break the law.”’ First, I
question Sessions’ association bet-
ween law and honor. Several years
| AZO the legal drinking age was 18.

Then the lawmakers, in their great
wisdom, determined that one should
be 19 before he/she could legally
drink alcohol. Most recently, the
drinking age was raised to 21. As the
drinking laws fluctuate, does honor
also fluctuate? Certainly not! Honor
concerns personal integrity: it has
nothing to do with civil laws. A law

 

Dear Editors,

In your last issue, you published an
argument given by Prof. Sessions that
drinking under the age of 21 is
dishonorable. There is one fallacy
committed in this argument, that what
Prof. Sessions considers dishonorable
is what the students consider
dishonorable. Prof. Sessions gen-
eralizes that the breaking of all laws is
dishonorable. This generalization
makes the argument all or nothing. If
we make one exception to the rule, the
entire argument is forfeit.

Prof. Sessions does not claim that
drinking while under age is an honor
violation. The Phi does this in their
‘*Talkback’’ section.

The White Book states that the stu-
dent body shall decide what is and
what isn’t an honor violation. I doubt
anyone will argue that drinking while
under-age is an honor violation, just
as no one would argue that speeding is
an honor violation. Therefore, Prof.
Sessions’ argument seems just a good
way to bait the students into discus-
sion of the ideas of under-age drink-
ing.

I don’t feel that Prof. Sessions’
letter was an attempt to influence the
honor system and, unless the faculty
decides to take control of the honor
system away from the students, Prof.

 

 

 

 

 

 

This past week Professor Sessions
raised a question which could have se-
rious ramifications for W&L and
which should not be taken lightly. The
Professor postulated that since it is
‘*dishonorable knowingly to break the
law’’ that ‘‘any W&L student under
21 who purchases, possesses or con-
sumes any alcoholic beverage. is
dishonorable.’’ The obvious implica-
tion of his argument is that it is (or
should be) an honor violation for
minors to drink alcohol. Unfortunate-
ly, however, Dr. Sessions has confus-
ed the notion of honesty, as it has
functioned at W&L since General
Lee’s presidency, with the notion of
that which is honorable or worthy of
respect.

The ‘‘White Book’’ very clearly
states that the honor system is based
on the assumption that ‘‘persons at-
tending W&L will not lie, cheat or
steal.’’ Thus, the basis of our system
is a ‘‘mutual trust’? between W&L
students and everyone we encounter.
Whereas it may or may not be true
that it is wrong for minors to drink, it
is not dishonest. Drinking by minors
may not increase their réspectability,
but it certainly does not involve any
deception. No one has taken an oath
not to drink or break the law, we have
promised that we will not lie, cheat or
steal. By drinking the student is not
denying ‘‘responsibility for his own
conduct,’’ but he is violating a civil
statute which the honor system was
never intended to enforce.

By an extension of the Professor’s
reasoning, breaking the speed limit or
jaywalking should also be considered
honor violations since the offender
knowingly broke the law. It would be
a devastating misinterpretation of
Lee’s intention in establishing the
Honor System to turn it into a legal
code. The General rejected the nu-
merous regulations and restrictions
which existed at Washington College
in 1865 and replaced all of them with
the simple idea that each man was to
act as a gentleman. He wanted to
create a community of trust, not of
legalism. Lee did not want to restrict
the students, but he wanted them to be
forced to accept the consequences of
their own action; the consequences of
lying, cheating or stealing have been
dismissal from the university since
that time. But, he certainly never in-
tended the system to become a police
code -- that was just what he wanted to
get rid of.

I, for one, would hate to see the
Honor System destroyed by turning it
into an unenforceable, legalistic,
petrified code. It is all too easy to con-
fuse specific and variable legalism
with those transcendent qualities of
true honor which are permanent and
immutable. The more you try to
stretch a system, the more apt it is to
break.

passed by Congress and the President
does not instantly alter the integrity of
230 million Americans. Anyone who
suggests otherwise devalues honor
completely; honor is changed from a
code to live by into a variable con-
trolled by a handful of men and
women in Washington, D.C.

This brings me to my second point.
I contend that it is not dishonorable
knowingly to break the law. Aside
from civil law there is a higher law.
This ‘‘higher law’’ is established on
an individual basis; it is the system of
morals which each individual estab-
lishes for himself/herself. When civil
law conflicts with the higher law of
personal morals, one must follow
his/her personal morals but be willing
to accept the consequences for break-
ing the civil law. For example, I do
not feel that it is wrong for me, a col-
lege freshman, to drink alcohol. But if
I am arrested I must accept the conse-
quences since I have broken the law
that the police have sworn to uphold.
Therefore, based on the above points,
I feel that Professor Sessions’ conclu-
sion is false since his opening point is
invalid.

Howeéver, Professor Sessions’ letter
has recalled to my mind another issue
concerning alcohol and the Honor
Code. During Freshman Orientation
we were introduced to the Honor
Code by the Executive Committee.
One question that was repeatedly dis-
cussed was the use of fake IDs. The
EC emphasized that by using a fake
ID one was playing an active role in
misrepresenting himself/herself. But
instead of stopping there, the EC (at
least some members) offered us other
ways to obtain alcohol. In fact, the
scene became so ludicrous in the small
group meeting I attended that the EC
member presiding even offered to buy
alcohol for us if we needed it. I realize
that seniors often buy alcohol for
those who are under 21 (and thank
God that they do), but it didn’t seem
appropriate for an EC member to
offer to buy us all alcohol during our
first two days at school. My point is
that the introduction to the Honor
Code could have been titled *‘How to
Beat the System.”’ I realize that this
paragraph is a total ‘‘add-on’’ and
doesn’t follow the rest of my letter but
I feel that it is important that the EC
not make the same error again next
year.

To the editors:

Professor Sessions’s syllogism
points to the transformation of the
honor system at W&L. In Lee’s time
the honor code required that every
student act as a gentleman. Since the
system originally included all student
behavior, Professor Sessions’ logic
might have held true under the first
understanding of W&L’s honor
system. I don’t believe, however, that
Professor Sessions wants to use the
present honor code to prohibit drink-
ing. Rather, I think he wants to
highlight the gap between how we
speak about the honor system and how
we apply it.

The idealized Lee-era honor code
that Professor Sessions’s argument
assumes exists only in the words of
admissions brochures, EC seminars,
and students’ egos. The current stu-
dent generation has (within its rights)
chosen to interpret the honor system
rather narrowly. We have effectively
reduced the honor code to three rules:

1) One may not lie to a member of the
faculty concerning course re-
quirements at W&L.

2) One may not cheat on academic
work at W&L.

3) One may not steal in Rockbridge
county.

Still, despite our narrow interpretation
of the honor code we insist on
boasting about it as if it were as broad
as the honor code of 130 years ago.
We want it both ways. We want the
prestige and freedom our honor
system affords us without the danger
that too much of our behavior might
be deemed ‘‘dishonorable.”’

Until we begin talking about the
honor code as narrowly as we have
defined it, Professor Sessions, and
others in league with him, will con-
tinue to delight in rubbing our noses
into the inconsistencies our preten-
tious rhetoric has created within our
own honor system.

[Class of ’89

This letter is intended to defend the
honor of Washington and Lee students
who consume alcohol while under 21
years of age. Their honor was called
into question in the January 11 edition
of the Ring-tum Phi by Professor
William Ladd Sessions.

Dr. Sessions contends that since
consumption of alcoholic beverages
by individuals under 21 is illegal, then
those individuals who are not 21 and
consume alcohol are dishonorable.
This method of argument makes
legality a strict determinant of honor,
but in reality there is no direct correla-
tion between honor and what is legal.
Is Dr. Sessions prepared to accept that
the sole criteria for dishonor be il-
legality? Is action honorable just
because there exists no written law to
deter it?

Law cannot be set up as the measure
of honor. Many individuals generally
considered dishonorable have never
been charged with breaking the law.
Many honorable men such as Robert
E. Lee, who lost his citizenship, his
personal property and his right to
vote, have suffered sanction under the
law. Law resembles honor just as it
resembles justice, but contending that
law is honor is as ridiculous as believ-
ing law is justice.

The philosophy of the Washington
and Lee Honor System reflects this
distinction between law and honor.
Our Honor System ‘‘is not a compila-
tion of student regulations. Rather, the
system is in essence one of mutual
trust among students, faculty, admin-
istrators, and townspeople.... The
Honor System is not intended to
govern minor infractions of the Uni-
versity’s or society’s regulations, but
only acts that indicate a student is not
worthy of trust by his or her peers’’
(philosophy section, White Book.)
The Washington and Lee Honor
System does not rely on laws, ‘‘the
System applies to any conduct con-

sidered dishonorable by the student
generation involved’’ (enforcement

section, White Book.)

Given the stated structure of our
System, its past success, and obvious
incongruity with written law, there is
only one explanation for Dr. Sessions’
challenge. He simply lacks understan-

An argument which appeared in the
January 12 issue of the Ring-tum Phi
claimed to prove that ‘‘Any W&L
student under 21 who purchases,
possesses, or consumes any alcoholic
beverage is dishonorable.’’ This
argument is invalid because of the ex-
treme weakness of its first premise,
which states, ‘‘It is dishonorable
knowingly to break the law.’’ Did
Martin Luther King, Jr. act
dishonorably when he knowingly
broke and lead others to break
segregation laws in the 60’s? In other
words did our country just celebrate
the birthday of a dishonorable man?
Consider this case. A driver runs a
traffic light in order to rush a dying
child to a hospital. Although the
driver has consciously broken a law,
he has not acted dishonorably. As the
two aforementioned cases prove,
there is no necessary connection bet-
ween personal honor and obedience to
the law. For this reason, the premise
“It is dishonorable knowingly to
break the law’’ is false. As any pro-
fessor of philosophy knows, any
argument which assumes a false
premise commits the fallacy of
‘suppressed evidence’’ and _ is,
therefore, invalid.

To the Editors:

In response to the argument
presented by Professor Sessions in last
week’s Phi, I wish neither to accept
nor to refute his premise that underage
drinking is dishonorable, for I believe
that the professor has raised a much
more serious issue which could have
an even larger impact on the Washing-
ton and Lee community. By not
distinguishing between that which is
illegal according to society and that
which is dishonorable according to the
Honor System as established in the
White Book, Professor Sessions has il-
luminated the greatest danger that our
university faces in its struggle to main-
tain a viable Honor System that can
remain an integral part of Washington
and Lee. The White Book is intended
to reflect a moral and ethical code of
values, not simply a legal code, and to
confuse the two could jeopardize the
future of the Honor System.

Surely other students will ask 1
such offenses as parking on Washing-
ton Street for more than two hours,
“doing 35 in a 25mph zone,"’ or
jaywalking should be considered
honor offenses. Consider, however,

the flip side of that argument by
following a hypothetical situation. If a
student is caught during a test with an
outline of the material on both
forearms, he is guilty of an honor
violation (assuming he was reading his
forearms, of course) and should be
forced to withdraw from the univer-
sity. To my knowledge, however,
there is no law on any local, state, or
federal level which could be used to
convict this student of a crime. The
questions then multiply: should the
Honor System apply only to those
“crimes Which are both
dishonorable and illegal? Should
members of the Executive Committee
be bound by legal codes when enforc-
ing this system? If so, is the E.C., a
majority of whose members have had
no legal training, equipped to do the
job that we elected them to do? If the
answer is no, should the Honor
System still be run by students?

A review of last year’s White Book
Revisions Committee reveals that the
subject of legality and its role in the
Honor System led to much heated dis-
cussion, especially in view of such
problems as date rape, a crime both il-
legal and immoral. To extend the
jurisdiction of the E.C. beyond those
matters involving lying, cheating or
stealing, however, would have two
consequences: first, it would create an
unmanageable task for the E.C.,
which would be forced to determine
which criminal offenses should be
considered dishonorable; second and
more importantly, it would ignore the
original intent of the Honor System,
which is stated explicitly in the
preamble of the White Book:

The Honor System of Washington
and Lee is based on the fundamental
principle that a spirit of trust pervades
all aspects of student life. The spirit of
this trust is one of principal features
that makes Washington and Lee a
unique education institution. (page 1)

Professor Sessions, underage drink-
ing - no matter how prevalent - is
against the law, and it may be con-
sidered immoral and even
dishonorable in the eyes of society. I
believé, however, that underage
drinking cannot be considered
dishonorable in the spirit for which
our Honor System was created. That
spirit does make Washington and Lee
unique, and the Honor System that
fosters that tradition must not be
threatened by suggesting that the
system’s original intent should be ig-
nored in order to stop 20-year olds
like myself from drinking. Put the
cuffs on me and take me to jail, but
don’t kick me out of school.

Thank you for your time.

Dear Editor:

Alas, the staff pharisee of the
philosophy department and _self-
appointed chairman of W&L’s
temperance committee, W.L. Ses-
sions, has remounted the soap-box
once again, while the good old boys of
our fraternities have another time
reaffirmed how woefully retarded
their own conception of honor re-
mains. The good doctor Sessions,
rooted firmly in the idealism of Kant
and Hegel, sees honor as some exter-
nal object monolithic and unchanging
as his own narrow mind; he not only
fails to see that willfully breaking the
law can often be a testimony to one’s
honor (hence, the civil disobedience
of Thoreau, M.L. King, Ghandi and
many anabaptists who languish in jails
due to their refusal to comply with
laws they feel would dishonor them),
but also that an unenforceable law is
not a law at all -- it is merely a dilatory
piece of scrivening that has been lob-
bied into the law books. Thus, Dear
Ladd Sessions’ logic is as usual, in-
fallible, but his premises are com-
pletely flawed. The Greek response is
even more disenheartening: They
would reduce honor to a mere system
of not lying, cheating, or stealing. To
quote one of them, ‘‘It should not
interfere anywhere else.’’ Applying
this sort of code is merely a sham, a
set of rules to disguise a dishonorable
man underneath compliance with a
system of honor.

As Lao Tzu notes, ‘‘Great Virtue is
not Virtuous” -- it is virtue that comes
from within, living within the spirit of
honor, not abiding in the letter of
honor, that can truly be called
honorable. In fact, it is a shame that
Mr. Sessions and the Greeks are not
on better terms; they both reduce
honor to a mechanical, small-minded
adherence to written rules for
behavior -- except that Dr. Sessions
uses this code for self-flagellation,
whereas the Greeks use it for self
punishment of a more pleasurable
form. If this is all our time-honored
tradition at W&L can _ produce,
perhaps we should bury it along with
its esteemed founder in the chapel.

Eating clubs:
One alternative

By Melinda Conkling
Staff Reporter

 

Alternatives to sororities as a social
outlet for women were discussed
Monday night in the GHQ. Approx-
imately forty women attended the
meeting, which was held to gauge
female interest and exchange ideas for
an alternative social outlet.

The most popular response, eating
clubs, could be started within two
weeks. ‘‘At least in the beginning
stages of the eating club project, per-
sonal commitment will be implicit for
the group to succeed,”’ stated junior
Mary Alice McMorrow. The eating
clubs will be held on campus, at least
temporarily, at competitive rates.
Eating clubs will be a casual, non-
exclusionary group for those who
have social needs to which sororities
cannot respond.

Sophomore Mary Hampson presid-

ed over the meeting and members of
the fourteen person steering com-
mittee fielded questions from the au-
dience. These questions concerned
eating club facilities, charity pro-
grams, conflicts of interest, expecta-
tions, and long- term planning.

According to Hampson, ‘‘We’re go-
ing to try to be very casual, very
flexible, and willing to adapt to group
needs. We can make this whatever we
want and that’s the beauty of it,
whether it’s only three of us or if we
grow to sixty people.”’

The committee is preparing a pro-
posal to the university so that several
members can travel to various institu-
tions and learn about their social
alternatives to sororities.

All women interested in joining an
eating club should be aware of future
flyers or contact Heather Midkiff ’92,

McMorrow °90, or Laura Hoopes

PE credits change

By Heather M. Midkiff
Staff Reporter

 

The physical education department
has reevaluated its policy on the re-
quired P.E. credit.

After having met eight times in the
fall in order to do a self-study on the
physical education department, the
coaches decided to allow only one-
fifths credit of the five-part physical
education requirement for those
students participating in an_ inter-
collegiate sport. This number has
decreased from the former credit of
two-fifths.

The decision was brought about
after the coaches reevaluated their ob-
jectives; one of which stated the pur-
pose of the physical education
department as being ‘‘To develop
basic motor skills through a wide
variety of activities.”’

ON CONTACTS.

Clear vision is essential to your success in college. Of course,
you want to look your best, too. But we know that college
expenses can put you in a budget squeeze. That's why we're
offering students $20.20 off the price of a new fitting of contact
lenses (exam and both lenses).

Just present this ad and a valid college 1.D. at the time you
place your optical order. You'll have 31 days to try your lenses.
If you're not satisfied, simply return them for a refund or
replacement. Offer expires February 28, 1989.

Athletic Director Bill McHenry said
the former credit of two-fifths for par-
ticipation in an inter-collegiate sport
““does not meet the objectives. We
aren’t being fair to students that way --
we need to offer them a wide variety
of activities.”’

Coach McHenry said that some
students in the past were not attemp-
ting to vary their activities. For exam-
ple, he said one student participated
on the water polo team, the swimming
team, and took lifesaving for the other
part of his credit.

‘*He never got his body out of the
water -- this doesn’t meet the objec-
tives of the department,’’ he said.
*‘We want students to learn new
lifelong activities.”’

The recommendation for the change
has been submitted to the Dean of the
College; if approved, it will go into
effect for the 1989/90 freshman class.

The Ring-tum Phi,

Soviet playwright and stage director
Anatoly Antokhin said Tuesday that
he believes the problems facing
Mikhail Gorbachev’s Russia today are
rooted in Russia’s history.

‘We must compare the present to
the past so we will understand what is
going on with Gorbachev's Russia to-
day, *’ Antokhin told about 140 peo-
ple in Northen Auditorium at Wash-
ington and Lee University.

Antokhin said the Russian state of
the 19th century was based on three
concepts: czarism or the idea of total
power for one man, the beliefs of the
Greek Orthodox Church which never
challenged the Czar, and the idea of
nationalism.

The late 19th century was a time of
transitions and confusions and accor-
ding to Antokhin, there was ‘‘no new

apparatus to implement this power.”’

He said that there were two schools
of thought after the Bolshevik Revo-
lution which marked the beginning of
Soviet history. The first saw the
Soviet regime as bringing no changes
and the second saw Russian history of
the 20th century as a dramatic break

Works by Soviet artist Tamara
Kirimova are on display as part of
a Russian symposium held in
Washington and Lee University’s
Northen Auditorium.

Antokhin said Kirimova’s works
are part of a new era of ‘‘socialist
realism’’ in art that has come about
with the new reforr1s in Soviet pol-
icy regarding freeiom of expres-
sion.

Complete artistic freedom,
however, Antokhin said, ‘‘can not
come about until sufficient distance
is placed between the individual
and the state.’’ In order to have
freedom of expression, he con-

Antokhin talks on Russia

from the 19th century.

“In my view both are right, ’’ An-
tokhin said.

According to Antokhin, in the 20th
century the Communist party has
replaced the czar, the Communist ide-
ology has replaced the Orthodox
Church and sovietism has replaced
nationalism.

The ideas may have changed but the
structures have remained the same,
Antokhin said. He said he believes
that this is the same problem Gor-
bachev faces as he tries to carry .out
his perestroika policy.

‘*There is very little chance he will
succeed because he is going back to
the same model, *’ said Antokhin, ex-
plaining that while Gorbachev's pol-
icy is supposed to be introducing the
nation to a western model, he is trying
to implement it using ‘‘the same old
machine.”’

He said reforms implemented by the
Communist Party can only be done
half way because the ideology of the
party is still opposite.

“In my view, the only way they can
have a possibility of real changes is if
they can return back to the time when
they tried real reform,’ said An-
tokhin.

The solution is not a simple one,

Russian artist’s work on display

tinued, the artist must have a sense
of personal property.

Political censorship still slows
the new movement in Soviet art.
Antokhin said before Kirimova
went abroad, her art works were
given an arbitrary price by the
Soviet government. The art was
then taxed at 100 percent of this
price so that any art work
Kirimova sells while abroad will
be taxed on 75 percent on the
profits.

“So in order for there to be ar-
tistic freedom, one must first have
economic freedom,’’ Antokhin
concluded about Kirimova’s work.

Nineteen paintings, tapestries
and batiks were put on display in
the University Library and will
remain there until Jan. 26. Accor-

 

and in many ways perestroika ‘‘will
succeed and never succeed at the same
time,’’ Antokhin said. He added that
the struggle with the structures will
give the people time to have a real
revolution, a ‘‘revolution of the
mind. *’

“‘Changing within people’s minds,
that will be the real change. In that
sense. perestroika will have
succeeded, *’ he said.

Antokhin is a graduate of the State
Institute of Cinematography in
Moscow. As both a Communist Party
member and intellectual, he struggled
to introduce dissent within the recog-
nized Soviet institutions long before
the advent of the Gorbachov ad-
ministration. He defected in 1980 but
remains an important bridge between
nationals inside and emigrees outside
the U.S.S.R.

Antokhin’s lecture was the first part
of a two part symposium sponsored by
the Russian Studies Program at W&L.
The second part of the symposium
was an art exhibit by Soviet artist
Tamara Kirimova which followed the
lecture.

Both the lecture and the exhibit
were funded by the Andrew W.
Mellon Foundation Grant in Russian
Studies.

ding to a listing of the works given
at the display, these works span ten
years of the artist’s creative life.

“They together represent a
major step beyond socialist realism
in the visual arts,’’ the listing said.
**As such, they constitute an im-
portant bellwether of the larger
changes” now struggling to take
hold in Soviet society.”’

Kirimova is a rising star among
the new. generation of Soviet ar-
tists, according to Craig Mc-
Caughrin, a politics professor at
W&L, and the organizer of the
symposium. Kirimova is currently
living and working in Moscow.

Kirimova has made all the works
in the exhibit available for sale.

Lectures on:
Jackson,
Lee, held

From Staff Reports

 

Two lectures on Robert E. Lee
and Stonewall Jackson will be

presented Friday, Jan. 20, at Wash-
ington and Lee University. The lec-
tures, which are part of Lexington’s
three-day birthday celebration honor-
ing the two Confederate generals, will
begin at 4 p.m. in the University
Library's Northen Auditorium. The
lectures are sponsored by the Wash-
ington and Lee News Office and are
open to the public.

I. Taylor Sanders, professor of
history at W&L and the university's
historian, will give a talk entitled,
‘‘When Lee Came Back to Lex-
ington.’’ This is a discussion of what
Robert E. Lee would see, and how he
would feel about the city and univer-
sity, if he came back to Lexington to-
day. Lee, whose birthday is Jan. 19,
was president of Washington College
(later named Washington and Lee
University) for five years after the
Civil War.

Following Sanders’ talk, Michael
Lynn, director of the Stonewall
Jackson House, will present ‘‘When
Jackson Came Back to Lexington.’’
Jackson lived in Lexington for a
decade before the Civil War. His bir-
thday is on Jan. 21. Both Confederate
generals are buried in Lexington.

A reception will follow the talks in
the Boatwright Room of the Library.

WLUR
broadcasts
Met Opera

By Lori Richardson
Staff Reporter

 

Direct from the Metropolitan
Opera House, WLUR is broadcasting
22 Saturday afternoons in a row of
live opera, including works by greats
such as Wagner, Verdi and Puccini.

WLUR is receiving the weekly
from. the, Texaco-
Metropolitan Opera Radio Network,

which is sponsoring five months of the

live programs in 1989. Generally the
broadcasts begin at 1 p.m. and con-
clude at 5 p.m., depending on the

B length of the performance, according

to Texaco-Metropolitan.

“These broadcasts are something
we really love to do,’’ said Chris
Casey, director of operations at
WLUR. ‘‘The network usually
charges a $6,000-$10,000 fee to tap
in. But because WLUR is non-
commercial, and an educational
operation, the fee is waived and we
can do it,”’ he said.

WLUR receives these broadcasts by
way of a satellite dish on the roof of
the university’s undergraduate
library, said Paul Merchant, who
monitors some of the shows.

‘*Usually there is no problem with
the broadcast, except when snow or
ice gets on the satellite dish and makes
Static."’ There is now a defroster on
the satellite, added Merchant.

The final 1989 broadcast will air on
April 29, according to Texaco-
Metropolitan.

Water Polo and Swimming. Two sports that require the
same amount of time and commitment as any other sport?
Not exactly. The life of a Washington and Lee water
polo/swimmer is not an easy one.

The ordeal begins in August, a full three weeks before
classes begin, when the water polo team kicks into full
swing with four workouts per day. Check out the sched-
ule. While most returning students are enjoying their
final days of sun and fun, the polo players are in the pool
at 7:00 am each day. The first workout lasts until 8:15
and then the second one goes from 9:00 am until 12
noon. Afternoon workouts begin at 3:00 and last until
8:00 with a whole hour off for dinner. The players
describe these workouts as being intense with a majority
of the time spent on conditioning.

These workouts (toned down somewhat when classes

Dedication and sacrifice

W&L swimmers/polo players exemplify true meaning of word committment

water polo and swimming has to endure for eight months
of the academic year. This extraordinary dedication has,
however, taken its toll. Several members of the aquatics
program planned to participate in both seasons, only to
realize that the commitment was too great.

It takes a special type of person to complete this
marathon of practices, polo matches, practices, meets
and more practices. Three seniors, David Dietz, David
Reavy and Stuart Sheldon are some of the few, along
with senior Jeff Bercaw, who have been involved in the
W&L aquatics’ program since they arrived in Lexington
as freshmen.

They have never been to Homecoming or spent a fall
weekend at Foxfield. The average Thanksgiving Break
for the swimmers is four days. Christmas vacation is cer-
tainly no vacation, either. Head coach Page Remillard
asks his charges to be back in Cy Twombly Pool on Dec.
26. Washington’s Holiday does not exist on a swimmers’
calendar. The team remains in Lexington for workouts
the entire week.

Generals to take four game road trip :

It was Thursday night. Students
were filing into the Warner Center in
hoards. Two thousand, one hundred
and ninety-nine to be exact.

Since when do 2,199 people to
come to a Washington and Lee
basketball game? Answer: Every time
Roanoke comes to town. And
Roanoke was in town last Thursday
for an Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference showdown.

During the player introductions, the
noise was so deafening that people
could not heat the Generals being in-
troduced. Said Generals head coach
Verne Canfield, ‘‘I can’t say enough.
We had a full house. I love it! They
are just a dream. That’s a beautiful
crowd.”’

The crowd got its money’s worth in
this one. Roanoke bolted to a 47-42
halftime lead on sophomore guard
Cary Gentry’s shot at the buzzer. Pat
Muldowney, a senior guard, kept
Roanoke in the lead throughout the
half with 14 points. For the Generals,
sophomore center Chris Jacobs,
recovering from a sore back, had 15
while sophomore guard Pat Gallavan
chipped in nine.

There were two reasons the Gen-
erals were behind at the half. The star-
ting backcourt of Mike Holton and
Lee Brading had combined for two
points. The other, according to Can-
field, was that the team was afraid to
make mistakes. ‘‘They were being so
tentative that they were afraid to make
mistakes.””

He remedied the situation with a
plea to his players. ‘‘I said, ‘Go out
there and make me some mistakes.’
They made some mistakes, but they
created while they made mistakes, and

" that’s the way I wanted them to play.”

The Generals scored 15 seconds
into the second half on sophomore

Craig Hatfield’s lay up. Then the team
kicked it into overdrive. Sophomore
forward Ed Hart scored. Brading nail-
ed a three-pointer, and all of a sudden,
the Generals led 49-47 with seven
points in 1:30.

After the Maroons tied the game at
51, Brading made the play of the
game. The Generals turned the ball
over, but the senior captain hid in a
crowd, stole the outlet pass, and
buried another three-point bomb to
give the Generals the lead again.

Roanoke closed the gap to one, but
after Holton drilled his only three
pointer of the night and Hart scored
from the baseline, the lead was 65-59.

When freshman forward Mark
Melton scored twice in a row, the sec-
ond with 2:15 left, Roanoke called
timeout. The score was 87- 74, and it
was in the books. When Brading
dropped in the second of two free
throws with 26 seconds left, the Gen-
erals had hit the century mark. Final
score: W&L 102, Roanoke 86.

Hart and Brading proved to be the
Hart and soul of the team. Hart scored
whenever he wanted, finishing with
22, and Brading refused to let the team
lose. Said Canfield on Hart’s perfor-
mance, ‘‘He came to play tonight.
Edward had been just a little bit ten-
tative, but he came out tonight, looked
at that basket, and had that ag-
gressiveness about him. This is the Ed
Hart of old.’’ Brading scored all 14 of
his points in the second half, and was
the emotional leader on the floor.

On Saturday, the Generals enter-
tained Marymount University. The
weather outside in Lexington was cold
and rainy, but inside, the Generals,
namely Holton, were on fire in the
first half.

After scoring 14 of the first 16
points of the game, W&L then turned
Holton loose on the perimeter. He hit
six straight three pointers after miss-
ing his first. Two in a row gave the

Generals a 22-9 lead with 12:01 left in
the half. Another two in a row, the
second from NBA range, gave the
Generals a 47-31 lead with 1:10 left.
When Hart hit from three-point land at
the buzzer (yes, ED HART), the Gen-
erals were coasting, up 52-33.

After intermission, it was @
different game. After scoring the first
basket of the half, the lead was 54-33.
Marymount then went on a 26-8 run
that closed the gap to 62-59 led by
Pierre Gardner and Scott Benson. The
pair combined for 17 of the 26 points
in the run. The Generals regained con-
trol, and when Jacobs dunked on‘a
breakaway, the lead was 75-68 with
2:11 left. He scored 13 of his 21 in the
second half, as the Generals held @n
for a 81-75 non conference win.
Holton added 20 points, Hart 12
points and 12 rebounds, and Braditg
11. The Generals connected on ,a
school record 11 three pointers on the
day. ‘

On Tuesday, the Generals ran their
record to 10-2, 5-0 in the conference,
with a 77-64 win over Eastern Men-
nonite. The Generals trailed for most
of the first half before taking the ledd
for good on two free throws by Jacobs
with 7:01 left in the half. The lead
grew to seven when Hart connected dn
3 of 4 technical foul shots after
Royals’ coach Mark Fleming was
slapped with two technicals. Tite
Royals closed the gap to 38-37 when
Duval Denlinger scored with nine
seconds left in the half. ‘

In the second stanza, the Generals
sputtered a bit before going on a 15-2
run to put the game away. Hart ard.
Hatfield spurred the charge. During
the run, the Generals held the —_
scoreless for 5:44.

Hart scored 14 of his career best 2
in the second half, and Hatfield addéd
14 points and eight boards. Jacobs, the
ODAC’s leading scorer, chipped in
with 16.

year. He has led the W&L water polo team in goals

leaders throughout his collegiate career.

‘Playing polo and swimming offers a great challenge
to everyone,’’ he says. ‘‘I didn’t want to swim when I

Prop 42 raises
many questions

Outside of our idealistic and near-perfect world of Division III
athletics, there lies a problem. It is a problem that has been with us for
several years now—a problem that no one has come even close to solv
ing. This past week, the NCAA made a stab in the dark at rectifying the
situation. Too bad it was just that, a blind stab.

The problem is a question of how you define that oxymoron “‘student-
athlete."” The NCAA’s solution in 1985 was the well- known and
highly-controversial Proposition 48 (now Bylaw 5-(1)-j) that required
athletes to score at least 700 on the SAT or 15 on the ACT and obtain at
least a 2.0 GPA in 11 core curriculum courses or be declared ineligible
for his or her freshman year and lose a year of eligibility to boot. The
athlete, however, was still able to receive a scholarship and have his/her
eligibility restored if he/she were able to maintain a 2.0 GPA after the
first year of college. The NCAA has now taken it a step further with the
passage of Proposition 42, which simply states that an athlete can
receive no financial aid unless the above criteria are met.

Prop 42 makes moot the question of Prop 48’s rightness or
wrongness. It’s narrow victory in the NCAA congress has afready caus-
ed quite a stir among coaches and administrators, the most ballyhooed
being the coaching boycott by Georgetown’s John Thompson. One
could argue the pro and cons of Prop 42 for days—it’s racist because the
tests it’s based upon are culturally biased; it closes educational doors for
the underprivileged; it will stop the student-athlete fallacy and put an
end to the exploitation of the athlete.

These arguments should be well taken, but that is not to say Prop 42 is
a good or bad thing. The NCAA’s intentions are excellent—prove to me
that you are ready for college work before we allow you financial aid in
the form of an athletic scholarship. The NCAA wants to improve its
graduation rate of athletes. Too many athletes who can’t handle the
course load are being given scholarships, only to fail in the classroom
after three or four years. The NCAA wants to turn that around. Solu-
tion? Set some sort of minimum standards that will show if the athlete is
ready or not to perform in the biology lab despite his ability to perform
on the football field

But allow me to throw a word out at you—opportunity. Aren’t you
denying an education to those athletes who, under Prop 48, were able to
demonstrate that they could, in fact, succeed in college. A 700 SAT
score does not sound like much, but there is truth to the claim of it being
culturally biased. Standards must be set, but where do you draw the line
and what do you base your decision on?

Tennis player Arthur Ashe agreed with the NCAA’s new legislation.
His reasoning? When the standards have been raised, the student-
athletes have elevated their academic efforts to meet those standards.
And, if you don’t cut the mustard, there is always junior college.

Excuse me, Mr. Ashe? Junior colleges are just as guilty as major uni-
versities when it comes to athletic exploitation. And is two years at a
junior college really going to do much for an athlete’s educational ad-
vancement? I think not.

Our society is one that strives for democracy and fairness. In order to
realize this goal, certain sacrifices must be made. In our judicial system,
you are innocent until proven guilty. Because of this, many guilty peo-
ple go free but fewer innocent people go to jail. In college there are go-
ing to be athletes who don’t belong there, but there are also going to be a
few that do. Athletics for poor people is their only hope to continue their
education. I hate to think of someone who wants to do just that but is de-
nied that opportunity.

It’s a grave problem but one that 1,000 NCAA propositions could not
solve. The problem lies in this society’s attitude towards education. Un-
til something is done about that, the NCAA is just making wild stabs in
the dark.

Tough aquatic foes
means experience

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

Both the Washington and Lee men’s
and women’s swimming teams ran
into some tough competition last
weekend and, in the process, proved
to themselves that they can perform
well against top-notch opponents.

The W&L men’s team, 2-1, lost to
Division If power Shippensburg, 105
85, on the road Friday night but gain
ed some valuable experience along the
way. ‘‘Shippensburg is an excellent
Division I team,” said senior David
Dietz. ‘‘They are one of the top three
teams in Division I]. We can swim
with them, although the score was
much closer than the meet actually
was, as they swam some people in off
events. They are a lot better than we
are, but it is good for us to go against
that kind of competition.’

The Generals responded on Satur-
day in Lexington with a 126- 78 defeat
of Division I UNC-Charlotte in Cy
Twombly Pool. It was, as Dietz put it,
a ‘‘good win.”’

“One of our big shave meets last
year was held down at Emory Univer-
sity and UNC-Charlotte was one of
the teams that finished ahead of us,
mainly because of its diving,’’ he
said. ‘‘So, we are extremely happy to
beat them in a dual meet setting this
season. They are a good team to swim
against and it definitely adds
something to our schedule.”

The women’s team, 3-2, was over-
matched against Shippensburg on Fri-
day night but gave UNC-Charlotte all
it could handle on Saturday in Lex-
ington before falling 116-88.

‘*We saw some really good swims
and it was a good experience because
it was the first time we ever swam

against UNC-Chrlotte, and because

 

it was good competition—something
we don’t have in the ODAC [Old
Dominion Athletic Conference],’’

said senior Nancy Whalen, who was
slowed somewhat in both meets by il
“We look forward to beating
them at the Atlantic States Meet.’

Besides there mal
competition between the two com
peting teams, it seems there was a
little more was at stake Saturday than
just a Generals’ win or loss

“Coach [W&L head coach Page
Remillard] said he would shave his
moustache if both the men and the
women won,”

Iness

being the not

said senior Elizabeth
Miles. *‘It’s just too bad we came out
on the short end of the score. [The
moustache] will come off when Atlan-
tic States rolls around.”’

Remillard, moustache still intact,
was ecstatic with his team’s swimm
ing, despite winning only one of the
four meets.

‘IT am very, very pleased with our
performance,”’ he said. ‘‘Not only in
the pool, but also the entire at
mosphere was outstanding

“I felt really good about our entire
effort. The team had to make some
important sacrifices, but they did what
I asked them to do and they did what it
took to perform at their highest level.
They swam great, but that’s what they
had to do. I am very proud of them.”’

Both teams will travel to the Wash-
ington area for a pair of meets on the
road this weekend. On Friday, the
Generals will swim against
Georgetown and on Saturday, W&L’s
road trip concludes with a meet
against Johns Hopkins in Baltimore

“We'll just continue to take it one
week at a time,’ said Remillard.
“We'll keep trying to build on the
good performances and make the cor-
rections when necessary.’

Rain Man is triumphant

Hoffman sews up Best Actor Oscar
in clearly the finest role of his career

Sa
By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

After Dustin Hoffman's first suc-
cessful film role in Mike Nichols’
surprise hit 7he Graduate, The New
York Times called him “*An amazing
| who] makes you feel a
little tearf d choked up while mak
ing you laugh yourself raw.”

in 1978. Time applauded Hoffman
the Kramer
Kramer. the film for which he would
later win the Academy Award for Best
Actor, saying, ‘*...He has turned the
screen into a mirror, a magical look-
ing glass into his own head and
heart.”

Then, after his role in the 1982
smash Tootsie, Variety noted,
‘Hoffman triumphs in what must
stand as one of his most brilliant per-
“formances. Although hardly blessed
with what one could consider feminine
or even androgynous features, his
Dorothy is entirely plausible and,
physically, reasonably appealing.”

There is no question that in the elite
fraternity of modern American actors
Dustin Hoffman can justifiably take
his place beside the likes of Jack
Lemmon, Marlon Brando, Robert
DeNiro, Robert Duvall, Al Pacino,
Gene Hackman, Paul Newman, James
Earl Jones and Jack Nicholson.

His inclusion in this elite
brotherhood comes on the merit that
since his initial success with The
Graduate in 1967, Hoffman has been
one of the most consistent talents in
Hollywood racking up Best Actor
nominations in 1967 (The Graduate),
1969 (Midnight Cowboy), 1974
(Lenny), 1979 (Kramer vs. Kramer for
which he won) and in 1982 (Zootsie).

And what about 1989 and Rain
Man? Well, unless the planet explodes
before April, Dustin Hoffman will
most surely take home his second Best
Actor Award at this spring’s Academy
Awards ceremony.

It is one of a critic’s biggest sins to
predict an award for an actor without
seeing all of the competition, but Hof-
fman’s performance in Rain Man is
not only far and away the finest per-
formance of the last year; it is one of
the finest performances of the last
decade.

In Rain Man, Hoffman plays the

 

new young

  

after release of Vs.

part of an autistic savant named Ray-
mond Babbit. As an autistic, Ray-
mond suffers from a defective sensory
system that amplifies the world
around him to a totally encompassing
level causing him to withdraw totally
into his own world

As a savant Raymond has the
phenomenal ability to read and ab
sorb. In one scene for instance, Ray
mond reads and memorizes the phone
book listings from A to G with the
total recall of any name, number and
address between the two letters. He
cannot, however, discern the concept
of money or reality. Raymond has
what seem like genius capabilities on
one hand, but has the technical 1.Q. of
a child on the other.

The film centers around Raymond
and his brother Charlie played by Tom
Cruise. Charlie, who left home and
cut off all touch with his father at six-
teen, gets monetarily cut out of his
father’s $3 million will and goes to the
trustee of the money to strike a
bargain. As it happens, the trustee is
the overseer of the institution where
Raymond has been living since he was
diagnosed as autistic in his early
childhood.

On arriving at the institution,
Charlie doesn’t even know he has a
brother. It is then, when Raymond
recognizes his father’s car that the plot
begins to unfold and the romance bet-
ween these lost brothers begins.

While obviously there is some plot
to the film, Rain Man is more of a
character study than anything else. It
is that unique film that Can take two
characters and make them so absorb-
ing that the viewer loses himself in
them for two hours.

It can be argued that without plot, a
character study is the most difficult
kind of film to make. Throw in an
autistic character and an actor noted
primarily for his looks and draw at the
box office instead of his ability to act
and you immediately create the poten-
tial for failure.

Rain Man is different though. It
trumps the wagers of the critics and
makes something especially beautiful
out of a project that few directors
would believe in; but there were a
fewiHoffman, Cruise and Director
Barry Levinson.

As Raymond, Dustin Hoffman
gives clearly the finest performance of

 

 

 

 

 

his career. While one of Hoffman’s
strongest talents has been his range,
playing everything from a college kid
in The Graduate to the slimy Ratso
Rizzo in Midnight Cowboy to an in-
dian in Little Big Man to a woman in
Tootsie, the role of an autistic is
different. It is one of those roles that
takes more than just talent to perform
successfully. It takes an inner
understanding and being of the
character. Hoffman pulls it off beau-
tifully.

In preparation for the role, Hoffman
lived with an autistic child for some
months to understand and master
every movement, every mannerism
and every mode of speech. Not once
in the film does Hoffman look into the

eyes of Cruise. Not once. While this is
incredible acting and in total character
for Hoffman it makes Cruise’s
responses very difficult with nothing
to work off of. Surprisingly, Cruise is
excellent and carries his weight very
nicely in measure to Hoffman.

It is quite an understatement to call
Rain Man a phenomenal film. It is in-
credibly moving both at the end and in
repeated scenes throughout the film. It
will make you laugh and it will make
you cry but more than anything it will
make you feel. It is definitely one of
the films that you can’t afford to miss
this year. It is true genius.

. Imagine how devastated I was
the day he [a professor] asked me to
sleep with him."’ -- a Washington and

, Lee female student

That remark is an excerpt from a
letter to the editor in this issue of The
Ring-tum Phi, and it indicates that
sexual harassment of students by fa-
culty is occurring on the W&L cam-
pus.
The Confidential Review Com-
mittee has created a policy to handle
cases of students harassing other
students.

But faculty to student harassment
falls under the jurisdiction of the
W&L administration, and the ad-

, ministration also has created a policy

‘

‘4

to hear complaints.
“*We have received indications that
there is the possibility of [faculty to

student sexual harassment] being a
problem on this campus,’’ said Anece
McCloud, Associate Dean of Students
for Minority and International Af-
fairs.

McCloud, the administrator who
handles complaints and conducts in-
vestigations of cases of faculty to stu-
dent harassment, declined to give
specific information on the number or
nature of any cases of faculty to stu-
dent harassment at W&L.

‘Confidentiality is the key word in
all of this. We will always take into
account the fact that this is a very
small campus and if details are given,
even without names being included,
people might be able to trace who is
involved,’’ said McCloud.

National statistics show that as
much as 20 to 30 percent of female
students will experience sexual
harassment from faculty, according to
the Project on the Status and Edu-

cation of Women at the Association of
American Colleges as reported in
“‘The Classroom Climate for
Women,”’ by Bernice R. Sandler, The
American Woman 1987-88.

‘*We are on a par with other college
campuses, especially of the same
type,’’ said McCloud, who said she is
ranking W&L according to articles
she has read on sexual harassment.
However, she pointed out that preva-
lence of sexual harassment of students
by faculty is difficult to determine.

“It’s a very difficult thing to
evaluate because there have been so
many victims--not just women, but
homosexual men--who have experi-
enced it, and for various reasons have
not talked to anyone about it. So we’re
just sort of guessing right now,’’ said
McCloud.

While sexual harassment may ap-
pear to be a female phenomena, Mc-
Cloud stresses that it affects men as

well as women.

‘‘This is not just a female problem.
It can involve two men, or it can in-
volve two women, or a female faculty
member and a male student. We must
not think of it as being one-sided,”

Wilson addresses

 

During his Founder’s Day and ODK
address, President Wilson addressed
the university's current weaknesses
and asked students to live up to their
claim to honor, decency and integrity

, by fixing them.

Wilson cited such weaknesses as the
“exercise of branding initiates to the

, Sigma Society, the breaking windows

in Graham-Lees dormitory, the

‘ alcohol games that are conducted in
, certain fraternity houses and the per

sistent core of shallow male
chauvinism.

**T thought we were out of that kind

of behavior and mindless exercise.”’

' he said

  

  

 

 

Si

He asked the audience in Lee
Chapel what would be striking or sur
prising to the Ring-tum Phi in the year
2014, should it look back 25 years;
just as the Roanoke Times & World
News recently featured a retrospective

on the year 1963 and the process of

de-segregation.

He asked if fraternities in 2014
would wonder about the alcohol
games, and if students then might be
dismayed to see chauvinism that was
translated from ‘‘tasteless t-shirt
slogans to a vulgar and more serious
sexual aggressiveness, **

Instead of saying things like this go
on all over, students at W&L should
realize they are not everywhere else."

Adolfo Calero, a leader in the
Nicaraguan resistance against the
Sandinistas, spoke last Wednesday
night to about 400 people in Lee
Chapel

Calero’s talk was the fifth in @eenee™

of lectures presented by Contact, a
student-financed organization that br-
ings public figures to the W&L cam-
pus.

“‘A true fighter for freedom and
democracy,’’ said Contact Co-
Chairman John Roach as he introduc-
ed the man who was forced out of his
country in 1982,

Calero began his talk by saying that
since 1978, the year the Sandinistas
began fighting for the communist
cause, over 600,000 Nicaraguans
have been forced out of Nicaragua.

‘That is 16 to 17 percent of the en-
tire population of our country,’’ he
said.

Praising the conservative
philosophy in the United States,
Calero said that ina New York Times
poll, 71 percent of the people polled
agreed with former President
Reagan’s foreign policy over the past
eight years. ‘‘His only failure has
been Nicaragua,’’ said Calero.
“‘Congress has not allowed for the
contras, Nicaragua’s freedom
fighters, to give a full fight.

“‘The United States’ foreign policy
has followed a zig-zag course being
somewhat inconsistent,’ said Calero

freedom

referring to the aid given to his coun-
try during the past eight years.

Calero questioned the productivity
of the humanitarian aid being given to
the Contras saying, ‘‘while the San-
dinistas are receiving all out aid from
Soviet Russia, Cuba and Libya, the
contras are not receiving any aid for

““weapons.”* ~~ =

He said that when military aid was
given to the contras, ‘“The Sandinistas
wanted to go to the negotiating table. ”’
He added that 15,000 contra fighters
were holding off more than 100,000
Sandinistas, ‘‘until Feb. 3, 1988,
when aid was cut off again.’’ He said
Congress approved in April 1988,
humanitarian aid that will last until
March 31, 1989.

**That will not hold up to the 30 to
40 million dollars in military aid that
is given to the Sandinistas,”’ he said.

‘*You are in a world where democ-
racy is under attack,’’ said Calero
warning the audience to ‘‘watch out
for their country. Athens fell to inter-
nal struggles, not to Sparta,”’

Calero asked for the cooperation of
Congress saying that although
Nicaragua and the United States were
formed from different roots, the two
countries are very similar now.

‘Religion, family, freedom, and
private property are our national
values,’’ said Calero referring both to
Nicaragua and the United States.

**We Nicaraguans are ready to con-
tinue the struggle,’ said Calero. ‘‘We
are ready to negotiate with the

Executive Committee

What’s happening on campus?

By Genienne Mongno
Staff Reporter

 

Prof. Robert de Maria spoke to the
Executive Committee Monday night
about the feasibility of making an
honor system video to be shown to
Washington and Lee freshman and
first year law students during orienta-
tion.

The video, which would be about
ten minutes in length, would be used
to explain the Honor System and EC
procedures to new students, according
to EC President Christopher
deMovellan. He said the video would
make it easier to explain the specifics
of an honor trial to freshmen.

de Maria said the video would take
about eight weeks to produce. He
Suggested the EC examine honor
videos used at Roanoke College and
the University of Virginia for exam-
ples of plot and format.

Once the EC had a working script
and students willing to act in the video
and serve as crew members, it would
need to locate a cinematographer to
create the video at a reasonable price,
said de Maria.

Both de Maria and the EC agreed
that the idea was worth looking into
further.

In other business, deMovellan said
he spoke with Dean of Students Lewis

John last week about an athletic credit
change. He said several credit alter-
natives were discussed, and he would
meet with Dean of the College John
Elrod on Wednesday to get the issue
straightened out.

This weekend deMovellan will meet
with the board of trustees in Florida.

EC Secretary Eddie Yu made a
report on the general procedures for
the Student Financial Relations Com-
mittee. The EC made several sugges-
tions concerning the procedures to the
chairman of the committee, James
Rambeau.

Rambeau said he would present a
revised version of the Student Finan-
cial Relations Committee procedures
to the EC as soon as possible.

EC member Mark Cobb reported
that the administration is in the pro
cess of purchasing several new
bulletin boards to be placed in various
high-traffic areas around campus.

The EC voted unanimously to give
the Ski Club $91.35 so its members
will be able to compete in the next two
races.

The Ariel, Independent Union, Live
Drive, Ring-tum Phi and Student Bar
Association are scheduled to present
budget reports to the EC on Jan.30

The meeting lasted about an hour

Bowling balls!

 

By Ted Fox
Staff Reporter

 

Lexington’s new bowling alley,
The Fast Lane, will be expanding
their facilities this spring

Tom Stagner, manager of The Fast
Lane, said construction should begin
in April on at least eight to 12 new
lanes at the alley, which is located on
U.S. 11, one mile north of Lexington

The Fast Lane currently has 16
bowling lanes with electronic scoring,
a snack bar and a game room. Expan
sion plans are also call for the addition
of a new bar area to the facility

‘We're planning on adding a bar
which will be of first rate style and
quality and which will complement

the rest of our new facility, ’* Stagner
said
Stagner attributes the bowling

alley’s success to the fact that bowlers
in Lexington no longer have to travel

to Staunton to bowl. Reduced rates in
the afternoons have also drawn
students out to bowl in order to avoid
the weekly league night bowling. ‘‘I
prefer to bowl in the afternoon
because there is usually a lane avail-
able and the rates are reduced, *’ said
W&L junior Rob Mould, a frequent
bowler at The Fast Lane. ‘That way
you can avoid the crowded league
bowling in the evenings, *’ he con
tinued

he Fast Lane is open from noon to
midnight, Monday through Thursday
Friday hours are from noon until 2
a.m. and moonlight bowling is from
midnight until 2 a.m. According to
Stagner, the lights are turned off at
midnight and music is played over the
sound system while bowlers try to win
free games during the special two
hour period

Weekend hours are from noon until
| a.m. on Saturday and from noon un
til midnight on Sunday

  
OPINION
aking a
Statement

This week the Ring-tum Phi chose to run a letter anonymously, a
policy The Phi usually avoids. However, an important opportunity
arose and the Phi chose to break its own code in order to make a
statement.

 

 

The Phi does not encourage anonymous letters for several
reasons. First, anonymous letters are often highly critical and in-
flamatory and sometimes filled with harsh accusations that these
might not normally be written were it not for the mask of anonym-
ity. If a writer wishes to be critical the writer must bear the conse-
quences of his or her actions.

Second, The Phi is a medium of communication for the communi-
ty of Washington and Lee. An anonymous letter would not provide
an avenue for a member of the W&L community to respond.

This letter was submitted to The Phi in late September, 1988. At
the time The Phi chose not to run the letter because of its anonym-
ity. After much consideration and more than enough encourage-
ment from members of the administration not to print the letter, The
Phi felt that the issue it presented could not be ignored.

Sexual harrassment on a college campus is a serious problem.
The Phi felt that Washington and Lee is not immune. We received
some negative support from members of the administration who
didn’t want the ‘‘calm W&L seas’’ to be rocked. Since September,
The Phi has realized that simply ignoring a problem won’t make it
go away, even in quaint Lexington.

The letter is an important part of the story of sexual harassment
at Washington and Lee.

Politics’ less glamorous side revealed

 

MY VIEW
By Jon Sbar

 

It was Friday, Jan. 20 at 11:55 a.m.
five minutes away from the Inaugural
Address. I was about to write the
greatest political commentary of my
life. I was ready.

My trusty journalist’s tool kit, com-
plete with pencils, paper and model
airplane glue was already open. Quiv-
ering with anticipation, I turned on the
television expecting to hear the
national anthem. Instead I heard this:

“I’m here to tell you about a man
named Jed;poor mountaineer never
kept his family fed, but then one day
he was shooting at some food and up

from the ground came a_ bubblin’
crude—oil that is—black gold, etc.
a

It was the Beverly Hillbillies.
Before I had time to change the
channel I was too far into the plot.

Since I missed Bush’s inauguration
speech I decided to cover the less
glamourous side of presidential
politics—the relocation of an old
president.

Yes reader, while George ‘‘Sex,
drugs and rock n’ roll’? Bush was re-
ceiving medals and eating chocolate
mousse, our old friend Ronald Reagan
was getting ready for the big trip back
to California. As the reader has prob-
ably guessed, I happened to be at the
White House for the sentimental
departure of a man who has just lost
his job.

Here’s how the scene unfolded.

Ron, wearing nothing but baggy
underwear, was trying to fit his lawn
mower into the U-Haul truck and
cussing at Nancy under his breath for
having so many ‘‘damn dresses.”’

Nancy, who was wearing polyester
shorts and a bandanna over her head,
was arguing with the White House
landlord about getting their house de-
posit back.

Nancy: Listen landlord, you’re go-
ing to give me my deposit back.

Landlord: Sorry Mrs. Reagan, but
I’m gonna need it to cover the cost of
that hole in the Oval Office.

Nancy: But that hole was there
when we moved in, Carter must have
done it.

As the Reagans got everything
straightened out they jumped in the U-
Haul and headed for California. Wat-
ching them head West into the sunset.

the Reagans make me think of the
Beverly Hillbillies.

The two families have so much in ~

common. I was so inspired by the
scene that I decided to write a poem

about the transition in and out of the '

White House sung to the tune of the ,

Beverly Hillbillies.

“T'm here to tell you ‘bout a man ‘

named ‘The Gipper’; before politics
he worked nights as a stripper. Then

one day he was sleepn’ in the nude °

and out of the closet popped a real hip
dude Bush that is Vice President a
Republican.

Next thing you know Ron and

George are drinking beer and then
George said, ‘Ron move away from
here. California’s the place you ought

to be,’ so Ron loaded up the U-Haul '
and moved to Beverly Hills that is .

presidential pensions retirement. "’

Geimer’s view on Contact speakers opposed

To the Editors:

I am writing in response to Professor Geimer’s
snide letter questioning CONTACT’s choice of
speakers. Mr. Geimer is especially upset that
CONTACT hires ‘‘criminals to come in and give
lectures reinforcing the arrogantly comfortable
view of the world already held by most of the au-
dience.’’ Aldolfo Calero’s presence in Lee Chapel
last week prompts his letter.

Well Professor Geimer, with all due respect,
you’re wrong. Mr. Calero is not a criminal
(unless, of course, you take what the Sandinista
regime espouses as truth). And the views of the
audience, which are also my own, are many
things, but comfortable they are not.

I learned a great deal last week about the
Nicaraguan Resistance and its leadership. I learn-
ed that Aldolfo Calero is not the capitalist pig that
you and other Sandinista supporters attempt to
paint him as. I learned that he is not a stooge for
the Coca-Cola Company. Aldolfo Calero stands

Dear Editors:

‘Hiring criminals’? Was a writer to the Ring-
tum Philast week really fretting about CON-
TACT’s bringing ‘‘criminals’’ such as G. Gordon
Liddy and Adolfo Calero to W&L? How about

Dear Editor;

This is in response to Professor William S.
Geimer’s letter of January 19, 1989 addressing
CONTACT’s recent sponsorship of Adolfo
Calero. Mr. Geimer questions ‘‘the wisdom of
that choice.’’ Referring to Calero as a
‘‘criminal,’’ he sees little value in a lecture
‘‘reinforcing the arrogantly comfortable view of
the world already held by most of that audience.”’
He asserts that it would been ‘‘better for truth, for
education, and for justice if CONTACT had asked
him to speak without charge, but with the
understanding that the fat fee that will unfor-
tunately be paid Calero be diverted instead to help
the civilian victims of his ‘freedom fighters.’’’

I respectfully disagree. It is entirely proper and
wise that Aldopho Calero speak at Washington
and Lee. The root of Nicaruaga’s woes is not the
Contras, but the sandinistas. The strategic loca-
tion of Nicaruaga has made the country a par-

To The Editors:

I am writing in response to Professor Geimer’s
critique of the Contact Committee, which ap-
peared in the Ring-Tum-Phi this past week. As
Vice-Chairman of Contact, I feel compelled to

for the same thing that Cardinal Obando y Bravo,
Eden Pastora, and Ronald Reagan stand for:
freedom, Linfer from your letter that you are will-
ing to believe the lie that Daniel Ortega and
Miguel d’Escoto and Fidel Castro constantly tell.
It is the biggest lie of the 20th century: the doc-
trine of Marxism.

Aldolfo Calero is a modern day Ben Franklin.
He is in the United States, as Franklin was in
France, to ask for help in the fight against
tyranny. We should never forget that the french
helped us in our revolution. We should help the
Nicaraguans in theirs.

And Mr. Geimer, do you really think that the
view I just stated is ‘‘comfortable’*? Don’t you
realize how easy it would be to swallow the token
line? Major newspapers like the Washington Post
and other lounge-chair liberals gleefully chant,
‘‘Give Peace A Chance!’’. Ah, now THAT is
comfortable. But if these leftovers from the sixties
weren’t so glassy-eyed in their vision, they would
realize that peace without freedom isn’t peace at

Alger Hiss, Angela Davis, the brothers Berrigan,
and Sister McAllister? There's a noble band of
jailbirds/criminals/martyrs. No problem with
those worthies, though, because they’d never
reinforce ‘‘the arrogantly comfortable view of the

ticular source of concern in American foreign pol-
icy since the fall of the Somoza government in
1979. In its place, Daniel Ortega has erected an-
other dictatorship which has succeeded in making
life even more miserable for the population. He
has broken his promises of democratic reform,
oppressed the Roman catholic Church, muzzled
the media, expropriated private property,
betrayed the non-Communist members of the
original Sandinista coalition, and ruthlessly
silenced his domestic opponents. He has armed
his nation to the teeth with weapons more ap-
propriate for fighting a conventional conflict,
rather than a guerilla war (e.g., tanks and jet
fighters). It does not require a leap of imagination
to expect Ortega to use these weapons to follow
through on his calls for regional revolution once
the Contras have been eliminated. It follows that
the Sandinistas represent a major threat to the
stability of Central America.

provide both undergraduate and law school
students, a more factual and non- ideological
perspective of this worthwhile committee’s
endeavors.

all; it’s tyranny.

Mr. Geimer, you’re upset. You’re upset that
me and my generation, or rather, the ‘‘audience’’,
is not going to walk with you down the easy path.
We are not a bunch of useful idiots. We will not
follow your direction, and turn our backs to those
in need. We realize that tyranny, whether it come
from the left or the right, from Pinochet or
Castro, from Somoza or Ortega, is wrong and can
not be justified.

The Nicaraguan Resistance is fighting for
freedom and against tyranny. And freedom is
something you and I have taken into our lungs for
so long, that we can’t even imagine what life
would be without it. Dammit, Mr. Geimer, men
my age are dying down there; and they are dying
for freedom. I would think that you could do a
little better than to write a caustic letter proclaim-
ing Mr. Calero a criminal, and my views as
‘‘arrogantly comfortable.’

world already held by most of the audience.’’ One
has to be so careful in picking and choosing one’s
favorite criminals.

J.D. Futch

Prof. of History

On the other hand, Mr. Calero represents the
only organized fighting force actively opposing
the Sandinistas. I do not believe former President
Reagan’s pronouncement of the Contras as the
moral equivalent of the Founding fathers. Nor do
I dispute that the Contras have acted on occasion
with shocking brutality. However, there is little to
indicate that such brutality is systematic, unlike
the damning evidence against Ortega’s regime.
The Contras are a better alternative to a Stalinist
police state bent on exporting revolution. Viewed
in a Bismarkian manner, it is in America’s interest
to support Calero’s organization. Thus, it is much

to our benefit that the W&L community was af-

forded the opportunity to hear Calero’s insights

even if they conflict with the views of Mr.
Geimer.

New policy strikes blow to W&L athletics

To the Editors:

The Physical Education Department's decision
to give varsity athletes next year only one-fifth
credit for their participation rather than the cur-
rent two-fifths was not made with the best inter-
ests of the varsity athletes and the status of
athletics at W&L in mind.

Coach McHenry was quoted as saying that the
department is not ‘*...being fair to students...”’
with the current policy because the athletes are not
offered ‘‘...a wide variety of activities.”’
However, the department will see that this is an
incorrect observation if it will only look around
campus on any given day.

Every afternoon, both gyms are overcrowded
with basketball pick-up games; intramural com-
petition is extensive; the squash and racquetball

courts often offer no vacancies; on nice days one
can find football or frisbee games on the colon-
nade, overflowing tennis courts, groups playing
lacrosse, bike riders, and runners.

The department must realize that more often
than not varsity athletes participate in the above
activities. Most athletes do not become dormant in
the off-season, and the exercise they seek is often
not the same as their intercollegiate sport. They
do not need ‘‘wider variety’’ in the form of an ad-
ditional P.E. requirement.

Athletics at W&L have taken the brunt of recent
changes at this university, as can be seen by
coaches’ recruiting frustrations. It is only natural
that the department wishes to reassert its role in
the ‘‘W&L experience.’’ But decreasing athletes’
P.E. credit is not the way to combat the depart-

ment’s and contribution, not punished. Sports can
again be an important and successful aspect of
W&L if the incentive to participate in them is in-
creased. The new policy will not increase incen-
tive.

The problem that McHenry mentions with the
swimmer who took P.E. lifesaving has an easy
solution. Simply prohibit an athlete from taking
the P.E. course comparable to his or her inter-
collegiate sport. Do not force the athlete to take an
extra course.

I hope that the administration and Physical Edu-
cation Department will consider these arguments
before they strike another blow at intercollegiate
athletics’ struggle to become prominent again.

The definition of sexual harassment
in the current faculty handbook and
University catalog reads as follows:

“Unwelcome sexual advances, re-
quests for sexual favors, and other
verbal or physical conduct of a sexual
nature constitute sexual harassment
when:

1) submission to such conduct is
made either explicitly or implicitly a
term of condition of an individual’s
educational or employment advance-
ment;

2) submission to or rejection of such
conduct by an individual is used as the
basis for academic or. employment
decisions affecting that individual; or

3) Such conduct has the purpose of
substantially interfering with an in-
dividual’s academic or work perfor-
mance or creating an intimidating,
hostile, or offensive educational or
employment environment. *’

Informal Phase

1. Complaints should be brought
to the Associate Dean of Students
for Minority and International Af-
fairs (currently held by Anece
McCloud), who discuss the com-
plaint with the student and explore
possible solutions.

2. If the student decides to file a
complaint, they will fill out a
written form describing the event.
If the student does not wish to take
further action, the written report
will be held on file at the Associate
Dean’s office.

3. If the student does wish to
take further action, the Associate
Dean will interview the accused
faculty member may file a written
report or statement of the incident,

cation Amendments states as

jected to discrimination under any
education program or activity re-

While this broad definition would
seem to include all ineppropiate
behavior, researchers have found that
faculty may treat female students
differently than male students in very
subtle, seemingly trivial ways.

Roberta Hall and Bernice R.
Sandler identified over 30 ways in
which faculty treat females differently
and outlined those behaviors in their
paper, ‘‘The Classroom Climate: A
Chilly One for Women?’’

**Some of the behaviors observed in
the study are so small that they might
be considered trivial. They do not
happen in every class, nor do they
happen all the time, and as isolated in-
cidents, they may have little effect.
But when they occur repeatedly, their
cumulative effect can damage
women’s self-confidence inhibit their
learning and classroom participation,
and lower their academic and career
aspirations.’’

What constitutes sexual harassment?

Some examples of this behavior:

© professors tend to make more eye
contact with men than women

® professors tend to be more atten-
tive, through gestures and body lan-
guage, while men are speaking than
while women are speaking

® professors interrupt women
students more often than men students

© female students are not called
upon as often as male students

© male students are ‘‘coached’’ to
explain their answers more than
female students

© professors respond to male com-
ments more extensively than female
comments.

These behaviors, combined with
remarks that disparage women or
make stereotypical comments or jokes
about women, are part of what is com-
ing to be called ‘‘gender-
harassment. ”’

How to file a faculty sexual harassment complaint

of the University to discuss the
complaint.

6. At the President’s discretion,
an ad-hoc committee will review
the case and conduct further in-
vestigation, if necessary. The
accused faculty member shall be
allowed to resent evidence and give
rebuttal testimony before this
committee.

7. The President, after hearing
the report of the ad-hoc committee,
may take whatever action he deems
appropriate. Any disciplinary ac-
tion will remain, to the extent
possible, confidential.

8. All reports and investigative
materials will remain confidential
and subject to disclosure upon au-
thorization of the President.

th year and therefore feel a little more
confident in coming forward.”’

Anne C. Schroer-Lamont, Associ-
ate Dean of Students, agreed, noting
that junior and senior women students
tend to be more secure in their social
lives than freshmen and sophomore
students and are therefore more confi-
dent in reporting harassment--be it
student to student or faculty to stu-
dent.

“‘Freshmen and sophomores are
still scared. They are under the belief
that somehow their social lives will be
completely ruined if they file charges
or if they talk, so they endure quite a
bit of quiet agony, or share it only
with one another, or don’t do anything
until sometimes a year or two years
after a very serious event,’’ said
Schroer-Lamont.

In some cases, nothing can be done
about an event that occurred more
than a year ago. ‘‘It’s too late,’’ said
Schroer- Lamont. ‘‘Where it’s not too
late is if we’re hearing the same name
for the second time, third time, or
fourth time, whether that’s a faculty
person or a member of the student
body.”

 

Sexual harassment is not limited to
the undergraduate school, said
Schroer-Lamont, noting law-students
have been abused by both peers and
professors.

In addition to the grade level of the
individual student, McCloud said the
diversity of students--‘‘some are go-
ing to be more willing to make a
report than others’’--and the increase
in the number of women at W&L may
have influence on the decision to
report a complaint.

Victims have also expressed con-
cern that harassment does not happen
to other students in their decision to
report harassment, said McCloud.

‘*The victims who have talked with
me, whether it’s been faculty to stu-
dent or whether it’s been student to
student, most of them have expressed
concerns about ‘This has happened to
me. I don’t want this to happen to so-
meone else,’’’ she said.

Faculty to student sexual harass-
ment is different than other types of
harassment in that a faculty member is
in a position of power over the stu-
dent, said McCloud.

Student to student harassment may
be as serious or tend to be more
*‘violent,’’ said McCloud, but ‘‘from
a layman's perspective’’ student sex-
ual harassment by faculty appears to
be a more ‘‘traumatic emotional expe-
rience.”’

**T think one of the reasons we can’t
get a grasp on how prevalent it is there
are sO many more fears involved,’’
said McCloud.

**Some see this as one of the worst
examples of sexual harassment
because the student is in a position
where they are looking up to that fa-
culty member as a leader, as a role
model, as someone who is there for
the purpose of helping them make ed-
ucational decisions in the classroom,
but also helping them make vital deci
sions in their everyday lives,’’ she
said.

‘*Part of the healing process can
sometimes consist of being removed
from the status of victim to the status
of being in control of their own
lives,’’ said McCloud.

The procedures for filing a com-
plaint are designed to help a student
take control of their situation, whether
or not they decide to make a formal
complaint.

And while these procedures only
recently were developed, W&L does
seem to be lagging in handling the
issue of sexual harassment.

According to Schroer-Lamont,

‘‘Other schools that went co-ed 15 or
20 years ago didn’t really begin deal-
ing with these issues until they had
been co-ed for 12 or 15 years. Some
are really just now dealing with it.”’

 

CONTACT

(continued from page 2)

 

our primary goal
for Contact ’88-’89 was to attract diverse and qualified
speakers, produce panel discussions and debates, assist
with symposia, and for the first time attempt to coor-
dinate efforts with other groups on campus, including the
law school. This latter concept has all ready proven itself
valuable in bringing to both campuses Mr. Russell Kirk,
which was an effort of the Contact Committee, the
Tucker Law Forum, and the Federalist Society.

In addition, we also stated to the Executive Committee
that it was a primary goal of Contact to greatly improve
the variety and quality of services provided to the student
body, while attempting to curb the reliance upon speak-
ing agents or agencies and thus reduce the cost of bring-
ing speakers to campus. Further, it has also been this
committees’ belief that it is functionally possible to bring
very qualified and distinguished speakers to campus by
relying upon and utilizing student, faculty, and alumni
‘‘contacts’’ in order to attract individuals for little or no
honoraria.

This concept was tested and proven this past fall, when
the Contact Committee sponsored engagements with
Senator Robb, a debate between the Chairmen of the
Virginia Republican and Democratic Parties, assisted the
debate between Rep. Olin and challenger Judd, while
also sponsoring a discussion by Mr. Rideout, of the
ABA. Only one of the Fall Contact speakers was paid
honoraria, and that was for Mr. Kirk, which was divided
by three groups.

This committee, also recognizes the reality that in
some circumstances we will need to utilize honoraria to
attract the best speakers, due to the fact that many in our
society follow the motto ‘‘there is no such thing as a free
lunch.’’ Regardless, Contact will endeavor to first utilize
W&L contacts in searching for speakers, and attempt to
bring them to campus at the least expense.

Contact has an open door policy to any student,
member of the faculty or administration who has a sug-
gestion regarding an issue or speaker that they believe
would provide valuable discourse and public debate in
this community. Professor Geimer, received a similar
invitation from Contact this past semester, in a open
letter that we sent to all members of the faculty and ad-
ministration, encouraging their participation and in-
volvement. It is unfortunate that Professor Geimer has
not accepted that invitation, rather choosing dema-
goguery on the editorial page.

Professor Geimer in his editorial suggests that the Con-
tact Committee should first determine the likely consen-
sus of the probable audience, and then turn 180 degrees
in the opposite direction to identify a speaker. I respect-
fully disagree, for this is exactly how past committees
selected such speakers as Dr. Timothy Leary.

In regard to the honoraria paid to Mr. Calero, it was
modest in comparison to the honoraria paid in the past for
less qualified and less capable speakers. Professor
Geimer also implied that the honoraria paid to Mr.
Calero will be used by the ‘freedom fighters’’ to harm
Nicaraguan civilians, and thus Contact should have di-
verted these monies to assist civilian victims of the
“freedom fighters.’’ First, Contact is not authorized to
spend its budget in that manner, and further I believe that
it is more reasonable to believe that Mr. Calero will
probably use these monies in order regain popular sup-
port in this country for the Contra Movement.

Professor Geimer also questions the wisdom of selec-
ting Mr. Calero as a Contact lecturer, due primarily to
his very strong opposition to the Contra Movement, of
which Mr. Calero is a leader. Professor Geimer also
suggested that Contact would have better served ‘‘truth,
education and justice,’’ if we had chosen a person to
speak, who was more closely aligned politically with
himself, which is a matter of personal opinion.

The selection of Mr. Calero, was a decision that was

carefully thought through, based upon the belief that Mr.
Calero would offer the student body and the W&L com-
munity, an opportunity to acquire first hand, the perspec-
tive of one credible insider representing one side of the
Contra issue. I reject Professor Geimer’s view that the W
& L community to which Contact serves, has an
‘arrogantly comfortable view of the world.’’ On the con-
trary, it is because this community does not have such an
ideologically blindfolded view of the world that it is will-
ing to take the opportunity to reaffirm or denounce their
support or opposition for the Contra movement, through
such public lectures.

Discussion over the proper and efficient operation of
Contact is welcomed and encouraged, however, analysis
or criticism of the committee’s functioning should be
devoid of partisan political rhetoric, and concentrate on
the facts. Finally, I only wish that Professor Geimer, a
person very well-educated on the issue of Nicaragua and
its civil war, would have requested the opportunity to
respond to Mr. Calero’s address. Or in the alternative,
exercised his right to have used the question period at the
end of the Calero discussion, to submit into the market
place of ideas his perspective of this very important
issue.

New Soviet policies put to test

 

By Brooke Jarabek
Staff Reporter

 

When the deans first informed Nona
Mchedlishvili and her classmates in
the Soviet Union that it was possible
to study in America, she said, ‘‘It was
kind of a joke.”’

‘*Everyone was laughing. We took
the test as a way to tease the teacher,”’
she said.

But when she and 55 other Russian
students arrived in the beginning of
August at Middlebury College in
Vermont, she no longer thought it was
a joke.

Her arrival at Washington and Lee
along with Vasily Kharik and
Vladimir Kulyukin is the direct result
of the Soviet Union’s new policies ot
Glasnost and Perestroika. This is the
first year that Soviet students are
allowed to study in America and
American students are permitted to
study in the Soviet Union.

These three students are promoting
better understanding between the two
cultures through their visit here.

None of the three expressed any
animosity toward the United States
before arriving. Nor do they have
much criticism of the U.S. now that
they are here.

‘‘America is supposed to be so
good, so fine. We knew about crime
{the abundance of it] but America is
the best life. That was the stereotype I
had before and what I see now,”’ said
Mchedlishvili.

Neither Kulyukin nor Kharik felt
America was that different from, or
better than, the Soviet Union.
Kulyukin explained, ‘‘The concept of
Soviet culture is a blend of so many
different cultures that are so mixed up

you can hardly differentiate between
them. American culture is more or
less the same because it’s a melting
pot.”’

Thus, culture shock did not bother
Kulyukin or Kharik. Both have lived
apart from their families to study.
Kulyukin studies foreign languages at
the Moscow Institute of Foi zign Lan-
guages and Kharik is a mathematical
physics major at Moscow State Uni-
versity.

Mchedlishvili, who is a journalism
student at a university in Georgia,
U.S.S.R., experienced some culture
shock. She had always lived with her

 

family until she came to America. She

said, ‘‘There is too much _in-
dividualism. It’s hard to be so in-
dependent.’’

But she said she likes campus life
because it has given her the chance to
be free to examine herself and
others—to test her limits.

The students had to pass tests ad-
ministered at their schools, have good
grades and be under 23 years of age to
qualify to study in America.

Kulyukin has learned English,
Norwegian, Danish and Swedish. He
came to America because he said, ‘‘it
was a golden opportunity to practice
my English.”’

He is learning Japanese at W&L as
well as taking classes in Greek and
Latin, linguistics, the study of the
English language and creative writing.

He would like to visit Great Britain,
another Anglo-Saxon country, to
compare it with America.

Regarding Perestroika in his coun-
try, he said, ‘‘The whole political
climate in the country has changed.
People are not afraid of speaking their

‘minds.”’

Kharik, who was born in Bukovina
located in southwest Ukraine, learned
four languages as a youth, none of
which was English. His only experi-
ence with English prior to his arrival
in America was through written trans-
lations of scientific material.

His courses at W&L include Soviet
politics, pure mathematics (functional
analysis), optics, asymptotics methods
in mathematics and tensor analysis.
He has submitted articles to the Jour-
nal of Math Physics at Duke Univer-
sity.

Although he misses the Lenin
Mountains and the parks where
Moscow State University is located,
he said, ‘‘I enjoy staying here at W&L
because I was born in a place that
looks like this with mountains, so I am
at home.”’

If his future plans to return to
America and teach at W&L or at an-
other university work out, Lexington
may indeed be his new home.

Soviets.”

Calero ended the evening with a
quote to the Lee Chapel audience:
‘*Too many people are ready to accept
for Nicaragua what they are not will-
ing to accept for themselves.”’

Calero, born in 1931 and educated
in the United States, received his
undergraduate degree in business ad-
ministration from the University of
Notre Dame and did graduate work in
industrial administration at Syracuse
University.

Glasnost — Vasily Kharik, Nona Mchedlishvili, and Vladimir Kulyukin of the Soviet Union.

Mchedlishvili plans to be a jour-
nalist. She assumed the authorities at
Middlebury assigned her to W&L
because of its journalism department.

She took only two years of English
about four years ago; thus, language
provided a large barrier for her.

The peopie of her native republic
are very important to her. She said,
“*A friend in Georgia is a friend for
life.”’

The presence of these three students
at W&L is helping to dispel myths and
prejudices formed from the lack of
communication between America and
the Soviet Union. Hopefully, students
will take this opportunity to learn
about their Soviet peers.

Calero returned to Nicaragua in
1958 when he took a job as general
manager of Coca-Cola. He also
became heavily involved in politics at
the time.

In 1983, he was nominated for
membership in the National Direc-
torate of the Nicaraguan Democratic
force, where he served as president
and commander in chief. In 1985, he
joined the Directorate of the United
Nicaraguan Opposition, a position he
held until 1987, when he resigned to
serve on the Directorate of the
Assembly of the Nicaraguan
Resistance. There he represents the
conservative political current.

Plans for hotel/conference center underway

DDA hopes to promote tourism and economic growth in Lexington

 

By Carrie Davis
Staff Reporter

Plans for the conversion of the Old
Main St. Mall to a hotel-conference
center continue but are not definite,
according to Dianne Herrick, ex-
ecutive director of the Lexington
Downtown Development Association.

The plan calls for the city to work
with the developer, Douglas J.
Nodine, of Greensboro, N.C., by ob-
taining a $1.5 million federal urban
development grant to provide partial
financing. Local investors are also be-
ing sought.

“It is well known that Lexington
needs more hotel space,’’ Herrick
said. ‘‘But a hotel can not survive on
the eight or 10 big college weekends a
year.”

Herrick said Lexington would make
an attractive small conference center

because of its proximity to Washing-
ton, D.C. and other large cities
throughout the Southeast. She added
that the quaint downtown area makes
Lexington an attractive place to bring
spouses and children.

“We feel that Lexington is a des-
tination for tourists and we would like
to have the kind of facilities for con-
ferences, especially with the two uni-
versities here,’’ Herrick told The
Richmond Times-Dispatch in a May
10, 1988, article.

‘*The two schools in Lexington
have a lot of alumni support. We feel
that many of them would like to come
back here for conferences and bring
their families,’’ she said. The hotel-
conference center would provide
facilities for small-to mid-sized con-
ferences for firms seeking a moderate-
ly priced, quality hotel.

The proposed hotel includes 100 to

150 rooms and banquet facilities for
about 300 people. Parking facilities
will be constucted.

Herrick hopes the new conference
center will promote tourism and
economic growth in downtown Lex-
ington.

Herrick said the completion of
Interstate 64 through West Virginia,
which has eased travel to Virginia

from the Midwest, will also encourage
Midwestern firms to look to Lex-
ington.

Currently, Lexington has no means
for holding business conferences. Ac-
cording to Herrick, the larger hotels
do not provide the elegance needed to
attract firms. There is also a lack of
space for dining.

We are here. We are at W&L,”’
Wilson said.

He spoke on what he called unplea-
sant things because ‘‘I thought it was
time we paid each other the respect of
our candor.”’

George Washington and Robert E.
Lee founded W&L on ideals of
“honor, trustworthiness, duty, civili-
ty, Magnanimity and a compassionate
caring for others,’’ Wilson said.

Rather than simply recognizing
these traditional values on Founder's
Day, he asked students to ‘‘translate
them into living and contemporary
terms.”

Tech’s Hokies wreck F-_

trailed victorious Longwood (70),

, Wo

wrestlers’ happiness [eile

By Chris Baradel
Staff Reporter

To talk to Washington and Lee
wrestling coach Gary Franke on
Wednesday afternoon was to talk to a
seemingly content man. His squad had
just finished fifth in the nine team
W&L Invitational, missing fourth by a
mere point, and, more importantly, it
was performing to nearly the top of its
potential. However, Wednesday night
did not bring such good cheer as
visiting Virginia Tech rudely treated
its hosts, winning the dual meet 39-
-I1.

First, the good news. Saturday's fif-
th-place finish was made even more
remarkable by the fact that the Gen-
erals did not even enter a competitor
in three weight classes. In fact, it

* would not have been inconceivable for
the team to have claimed third place
had the Generals been at full strength.
Officially, W&L’s 39 team points

Gettysburg (54.5), Furman (46.5),
and Gardner-Webb with 40 points.

Individually, five W&L wrestlers
had big days. Senior Rich Redfoot,
masterful as always, won the 190-
pound title. Sophomore Larry Pilkey
(10-4 as of Thursday) and _ fine
freshman Peer Soderberg at 158 both
made the finals of their weight classes,
but did not capture the championship.
Senior Manoli Loupassi was third in
the 177-pound division, and sopho-
more Bill Avery came in fourth at
150.

Franke said that all five wrestlers
who placed did well, emphasizing
that, ‘‘We wrestled to the top of our
potential in the classes where we plac-
ed.”’ He was ‘‘not surprised’’ that
those individuals did as well as they
did, saying that they had shown the
capacity before. He was pleased with
Loupassi, a senior captain, who
sprung from an unseeded position to
earn third place in his weight class.

Senior Richard Redfoot seems in com

urday’s W&L Invitational.

W&L scheduled the match against
Tech, a Division I school, because the
only way to get weekday meets is to
schedule in-state schools. While
Franke was not thrilled about facing a
team full of scholarship players, his
team had already faced Division I
wrestlers (from Furman), and he

hoped that perhaps the meet ‘‘could
help prepare us down the road...”’
Predictably, after a pin by Pilkey
evened the score at six apiece, Tech’s
superior depth and ability took hold.
The Hokies captured 27 points in a
row on two pins, one forfeit, and three
decisions. This iced the match, but

plete control of his first-round opponent in Sat-

Redfoot, once again wrestling after
the match had already been decided,
was spectacular. He dominated his
opponent from beginning to end,
feeding him a thorough drubbing to
win by technical fall in the second
period. It was the highlight of the
evening for W&L.

Generals falter at Hampden-Sydney; remain atop ODAC standings

“By Jay Plotkin
‘ Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee basketball
tteam had something to prove to itself
over the past week.
The Generals know they can win at
:home (they are undefeated in the
Warner Center so far this season), but
‘it is the long and winding road that has
, caused problems for W&L. This past
week the Generals undertook a vicious
’ four-game road trip.
This tough road swing for W&L all
began last Thursday, starting with a
* stop in Bridgewater.
The teams traded baskets until
Bridgewater took a 20-15 lead on
‘Todd Deberry’s three pointer with
9:19 left in the first half. Deberry,
BC’s leading scorer, scored seven
first half points and finished with 10,
well below his 16.9 average. When
Bridgewater's own round mound of
something, Ben Beach, hit two free
_throws with 5:16 left, the Eagles led

26-25. That proved to be their last
lead of the night.

Senior guard Lee Brading put the
Generals in front, scoring seven of the
team’s last 11 points in the half to give
the Generals a 36-29 lead. He scored
10 of his team-high 17 in the first half
on four of six shooting, and the Gen-
erals led at halftime by the score of
36-31.

In the second half, the Generals
were without sophomore center and
leading scorer Chris Jacobs for much
of the time (foul trouble), but the
Eagles only made one serious run at
W&L.

Sophomore forward Edward Hart
stepped to the forefront for W&L,

however, and put the Generals out of
danger. W&L could then relax and
coast to its 74-64 victory.

On Saturday, the Generals ventured
out of the conference to take on Mary
Washington, where they had never
won. W&L overcame a rather slow
start—down 13-0 early—to win the
game 94-85 and extend its winning

streak to nine games.

On Tuesday, the Generals returned
to the ODAC to take on Hampden-
Sydney on the road. The last time
these two teams met, the Generals
walked all over the Tigers 94-74, and
head coach Verne Canfield knew
payback was on the minds of Hamp-
den-Sydney. ‘‘They will be, as they
say, waiting for us. They have been
playing well of late. They have a lot of
fire power, and they will be highly
motivated, ”’

Hampden-Sydney was
highly

indeed
motivated. The Generals,

though, were able to weather the first

Tiger flurry, leading 41-39 at the half.

Canfield’s main worry prior to the
contest was not to get involved in a
running game with Hampden-Sydney.
**Sydney wants to play very much an
up-tempo game, and that is some con-
cern of mine, because we've been
playing an up-tempo game, yet I don’t
think we can play it all the time.

The Tigers then came out running in
the second half, going on a 9-2 run to
lead 48-43. The Generals closed to
48-46 on a Brading three-point play,
but that would be as close as W&L

would get. Ralph Baker’s (22 points)
three-point bomb put the Tigers up 60-
49 at the 15:00 mark, and they never
looked back, running to a 93-79 win
exclamated by Orson Williams’ (16,
I! rebounds) dunk with five second
left to stop the Generals nine-game
streak,

Next up for the 12-3, 6-1 Generals

Henry tonight on the road (WLUR-

Generals finally return home Saturday

Women swimmers undaunted despite two losses

By Amy Packard
Staff Reporter

The women’s swim team remains
undefeated in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference and undaunted by
its recent losses to non-conference op-
ponents Georgetown and Johns
Hopkins. These past meets served
more as training than as realistic com-
petition.

This strategy has paid off with
unexpected results. Sophomore

Still training intensively, the team is
looking forward to the beginning of a
resting phase. Spirits are high,
though, despite the grueling regimen.

“It’s unusual for everyone to be in
such good spirits,’ said Remillard.
“In the middle of the season that’s not
expected.”’

The women will need to hold on to
that adrenalin for their next two
meets. The first is at 7 p.m. on Friday
against Shepherd College. Then on
Saturday they will compete against
Gettysburg at 1 p.m. Both meets will
be at home, and both competitors will
be fierce. Remillard is optimistic. §

“If enthusiasm is any indicator, we
are a very healthy, strong team.”’

Head Coach Page Remillard is pro-
ud of the women for their attitudes:
toward these particularly challenging
meets and for their gutsy perfor-
mances.

“‘The women have inherited a
difficult schedule because many
schools want meets with both men and
women,” he said. ‘‘Often, in order
for the men to compete, the women
have to race also. As a consequence,
there are some teams —-which the
women aren't yet prepared for, but
they do well in ways that the final
score doesn’t always show.’

Bercaw leads
swimmers

by Georgetown

By Tom Wingfield
Staff Reporter

 

 

One might say the Washington and
Lee men’s swim team had an up and
down couple of days this past week-
end on its trip to Baltimore and Wash-
ington.

The Generals faced the Georgetown
Hoyas on Saturday afternoon at less
than full strength as some of the key
members of the team were fighting il-
Inesses. Despite this factor and the
thirty points W&L spotted the Hoyas
after the diving competition, the Gen-
erals went on to win the dual meet
125-95.

The Generals were sparked by
strong performances from both
Jeff Bercaw and David Olson.
‘“Bercaw is beginning to swim like I
know he can,”’ said head coach Page
Remillard. ‘tHe really keyed us this
weekend. ”’

After defeating the Hoyas the Gen-
erals headed north to Baltimore where
they faced rival Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity. W&L was the victim of some
bad luck on this particular Sunday
afternoon. First of all, senior David
Dietz fell prey to a misjudged wall as
he completely missed the wall on a
flip turn in the 50 freestyle. This
resulted in a sixth place finish and a
time Dietz has not had since grammar
school.

“| have been practicing a new flip
technique because I’ve been turning
too close to the wall. I guess I just mis-
judged the wall and flipped too far - I
simply missed the turn.”’

The other General misfortune came
in the form of a disqualification in the
200 breaststroke. Olson was the un-
fortunate victim as it was ruled he
used an illegal butterfly kick instead of
the proper method. This resulted in a
fifteen point swing against W&L
because Olson had won the event.

These two mishaps really put W&L
in a hole, but the Generals didn’t sur-
render. ‘‘We made a great effort to get
back into a situation to win. It came
down to the final relay where we were
touched out by six-tenths of a second.
We showed a lot of poise and com-
posure in our comeback. Hopefully
performances like these will spring us
into great post season performances,”’
said Remillard.

Despite. the 111-93.Joss to Hopkins,
Remillard is very pleased with his
swimming at this point in the season.
‘“‘We are swimming very well at a
time when there is usually a let down
in the season. The guys are keeping
high spirits and they know faster times
now will result in faster tapering times
later,’” he said.

Other strong performances for the
Generals came from senior David
Reavy, junior Shawn Copeland and
Jay Smith, all of whom are making a
lot of progress this year.

The Generals’ next two meets are
both at home — Friday against Shep-

herd and Saturday versus Gettysburg

— in the friendly confines of Cy
Twombly Pool.

Calling All Seniors

Contribute to

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

Some time last term I overheard a
sophomore complaining about
coeducation and thought to myself
*‘What gives him to right to com-
plain about it? If he didn’t like it he
shouldn’t have come to Washington
and Lee.”’

For us seniors, it seems that
coeducation and its effects on our
beloved institution has been the
topic of concern from day one.
Some of the discussion has been
enlightening while some of it has
been so outrageously absurd that it
was embarrassing. Nevertheless,
the arguments, the feelings and the
emotions rage on waging whether
coeducation has been good or bad
and whether or not it ever should
have been instituted in the first

place.

‘‘A Look at Coeducation: 4 years later’

Now, Seniors, it is your turn to
speak.

In the last couple weeks of the
term I am going to put together a
special supplement to the Ring-tum
Phi called ‘‘A Look at Coeducation:
Four Years Later.’’ The supple-
ment will be comprised of letters
from President Wilson, selected
deans and professors and from you
the senior class.

I have chosen to use only letters
from our class because we are the
only ones who can justifiably carry
on this conversation. We were the
first coeducational class and we are
the only class to have experienced
that.

I think it is safe to say that many
of the large wrinkles that we en-
countered in September, 1985 were
ironed out by the time the class
behind us arrived in 1986. We were
the first, we were the most focused

on, and if nothing else we are the
transition between the Washington
and Lee of old and that of the
future. And because of that, it is
time to put all of our thoughts, feel-
ings and emotions into a concise col-
lection to see where coeducation at
Washington and Lee is, where it has
been and where it is going.

The senior letter section of the
supplement will be made up of
somewhere between 35 to 45 letters.
Unfortunately, due to financial and
special restrictions, we cannot af-
ford to print every letter we receive.
We will however, include as many
as possible.

The letters should be between 400
and 500 words and should be well
written and legible. A_ selection
panel of two professors, two
students and myself will choose the
letters for inclusion based on their
clarity and their content. The use of

libelous or profane language in any
letter is strictly prohibited and will
be grounds for exclusion from con-
sideration. Letters should be
brought to the Ring-tum Phi office
on the second floor of the University
Center by Friday, February 10 (the
day we leave for Washington Break)
at noon.

This can be a very worthwhile col-
lection if you take the time to be
heard. Too often I think we have
had meaningful things to say but
have never taken the necessary time
to sit down and write a letter. Now
is the opportunity to come together
as a class; as the first class, to once
and for all vent all of our frustra-
tions and ali of our emotions about
the one thing that has dominated
our lives for the past four years.
Please take the time to contribute.
Make this something we can all be

proud of.

Heat of the Night and Midnight Caller
lead excellent programming on NBC

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

Some time ago somewhere near the
beginning of the *80’s there was a tur-
naround in television that few could
believe. NBC had taken home the last
place trophy in the Nielsens for who
knows how long while CBS and ABC
wallowed at the top supported by the
occasional mini-series and a host of
mediocre programming. Then, the
wonderkid showed up at NBC.

Brandon Tartikoff, the now head of
NBC, turned the network around from
last place and put it at the top of the
ratings. Quality, intelligent program-
ming is what gave NBC the edge and
is exactly what will keep it at the top
of the ratings.

In the Heat of the Night and Mid-
night Caller are two of the programs
that will keep it there and two of the
best shows to come along in years.

From Hill Street Blues to the current
hit L.A. Law, it is clear that NBC

decided that intelligent programs deal-
ing with morals and ethics were the
way to go. Now with the addition of
the two new programs, the argument
strengthens. But so does NBC’s pro-
gramming.

In the Heat of the Night is based on
the 1967 Norman Jewison film that
won five Academy Awards including
Best Picture. Sidney Poitier plays a
big city detective who comes south to
help a Redneck sheriff, played by Rod
Steiger, solve a bizarre murder
mystery. The film hasn't lost any of
its timeliness at all and neither has the
program.

Harold Rollins of Ragtime and A
Soldier’s Story fame plays Mr. Tibbs
while Carroll O’Connor who every-
one remembers as the cranky Archie
Bunker on All in the Family takes on
Steiger’s role as the sheriff.

Just as effectively as the film, Jn the
Heat of the Night takes on the racial
issues of a black man living in the
deep south during the ‘60s, and adds

to them. The program presents the
issue of predjudice, but never harps
on it as the only issue. It deals with
other sensitive issues such as incest as
well.

In the Heat of the Night is an intel-
ligent look at life in the south during
the 60’s (the show is set in Sparta,
Mississippi) and at many of the moral
and ethical problems facing us today.
The acting is excellent and the pro-
gram very worthwhile.

The other new NBC program set-
ting the world on fire is Midnight
-aller starring Jack Cole and Wendy
<ilbourne. Cole plays Jack Killian, a
once-time cop who accidently shot his
partner in the crossfire during a drug
bust. Killian now works as a late-night
radio talk show host who deals with a
different ethical dilemma each night
and then takes calls from the public.

Midnight Caller is one of the best
new programs to come along in years.
Every episode is incredibly well-done
and timely. One episode dealt with a

man who had AIDS, who knew he had
the disease and who continued to in-
fect people. Last week’s episode,
timely with the Bundy execution
earlier this week, was about capital
punishment and the last thoughts of a
man ready to die for his crime.

The program always follows the
same format and always sums up the
moral questions and answers at the
end. If you have seen The Hitchhiker
on HBO, Midnight Caller is much like
that. It’s not quite as bizarre as The
Hitchhiker but it’s equally as good if
not better.

Underclasswomen are seen here last Thursday on Bid night.

Nearly 260 women
say ‘yes’ to Greek

 

By Caly Smith
Staff Reporter

Two-hundred and fifty-nine Wash-
ington & Lee women pledged
sororities in the University Center last
Thursday after attending a five-day
rush.

Rush interviews, acquaintance par-
ties and bid night took place in three
rooms decorated with balloons and
other paraphernalia. Alumnae of Chi
Omega, Kappa Alpha Theta and Kap-
pa Kappa Gamma ran the rush, as
national members do when sororities
are first colonized on a campus.

Commonly referred to as sororities,
these Greek groups are actually called
women’s fraternities because the term
sorority did not exist when they were
founded.

Lissa Bradford, National
Panhellenic Area Advisor, was ex-
cited at how well the affair turned out.

“The reaction of the girls was
rewarding,’’ she said. ‘‘Everybody
seemed pleased about what they
pledged and I hope the three outstan-
ding groups can maintain those at-
titudes.”’

After two nights of mingling among
the sororities, the rushees filled out
**preference cards,’’ marking their
Ist, 2nd, and 3rd choices. Unlike
fraternity rush, women only get one
bid to an organization so no choosing
is involved after the preference card
has been turned in. The ‘three
sororities took the maximum amount
of women.

Julie Cline, a member of the Sorori-
ty Advisory Committee, felt the pro-
cess ran very smoothly.

‘*We were mainly concerned about
scheduling problems,’’ she said. ‘“But

Washington and Lee University has
been noted in the February issue of
Southern Magazine as being one of the
top 28 liberal arts colleges in the
South.

The article provides information for
high school students about the best
qualities to look for in a college. The
colleges listed in the magazine were
selected from Peterson's Competitive
Colleges, Barron's Guide to the Most
Prestigious Colleges, and Lovejoy’s
College Guide. The writer of the arti-
cle, Catherine O’Shea, described the
colleges as ‘‘attracting the cream of

be turning to W&L as an example of
Greeks and administrators working
together.”’

In response to the article, Tim
a W&L admissions
counselor, said the biggest reason the

» university attracts so many students is

because ‘‘W&L combines the per-
sonal attention of the smaller liberal
arts colleges with the broad academic

opportunities of larger universities.”’

thanks to Lissa Bradford, girls who
wanted to rush but had conflicts, such
as play practice, concerts, or sports,
were accommodated. ”’

According to Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy’’
Atkins, associate dean of students,
rush was consolidated to a five day
period instead of a more typical pro-
cess of several weeks because the
national representatives came from
out of town.

“‘T have had all positive feedback,
especially from the national women
who ran the program,’’ he said.
“‘They were very complimentary of

‘the W&L women for their enthusiasm
and ability to grasp the whole pro-
cons.’

Atkins added that rush will take
place next January as well, although a
bit earlier, because of organizational
reasons.

Each sorority has a chapter consul-
tant to insure the success of the col-
ony. These women, Penny Pierce of
Chi O, Lynda Fairman of Theta and
Lorrie Favret of Kappa will remain at
W&L until the end of the year. The
national fraternities will send in
replacements for next year.

Installation of the colonies will take
place some time in May. In the mean-
time, a college Panhellenic (com-
parable to the Interfraternity Council)
will be organized, along with service
and community projects and socials.

According to Fairman the various
projects will be a way to unite the
women both in and out of their
perspective groups.

‘The unity of the women within
their fraternity and through the
Panhellenic is exciting,’’ she said.
“‘The combination of these is what’s
going to make the whole women’s
Greek system stronger.”’

Bands to include the Connells, 6 others

 

From Staff Reports

 

Washington and Lee University is
hosting its 11th Annual Superdance to
benefit the Muscular Dystrophy
Association. The dance will be held
Friday and Saturday, Feb. 3 and 4, in
the Student Activities Pavilion from 6
p.m. to 1 a.m. each night. Live Drive
will be available starting at 5:30 to
transport dancers to the Pavilion.

Friday night will begin with a Battle
of the Bands competition between
campus bands. The bands _par-
ticipating are C.H.O. (Kappa Sigma),
Green Eggs & Ham (Phi Delta Theta),
Lost in the Supermarket (Kappa
Alpha), and We Have No Name (Phi
Kappa Sigma). These bands will be
followed by Widespread Panic, a band
out of Athens, Georgia. Wildgrass
and the winner of the Battle of the
Bands will open for Indecision and
The Connells on Saturday night.

‘*The quality of the bands that we
have for this year’s Superdance was
made possible not only through

pledges, but also through a substantial
donation from the Student Activities
Board for which we are very
grateful,’’ said Wright Ledbetter,
chairman of the event.

Pie throws will also be held Satur-
day night at around 11 p.m. The three
chosen faculty members for this event
are Coach Buck Leslie, W&L golf
team; Coach Page Remillard, W&L
swim team; and Professor Joel Snow,
Military Science.

Debi Hurtt, co-chairman of the
event, expects that there will be 150
dancers this year compared to 110 last
year. Each dancer solicits pledges for
MDA. A prize will be given for the
largest amount of cash and pledges
and also for the largest amount of cash
raised. Prizes are also awarded to the
fraternity and the organization do-
nating the most money.

The prizes include weekends for
two at the Dupont Plaza in
Georgetown, the Greenbriar, the
Williamsburg Hilton, and The Hotel
Roanoke. A complete package to Fan-

cy Dress and gift certificates from
many local merchants will also be
awarded.

A weekend admission package is
available for $10. Admission for only
Friday night is $4 per person and ad-
mission for Saturday night is $8 per
person. All of the money raised
through dancers and spectators is do-
nated ‘to the Roanoke chapter of
MDA. ‘‘We expect to receive the bulk
of money from the fraternities because
they are the largest student force on
campus, and now with the introduc-
tion of sororities at W&L we hope to
have an equally substantial contribu-
tion from the women,’’ said
Ledbetter.

Superdance has also had other
events throughout the year including
two Super-Bowl bowling nights at
Fast Lane, a Casino Night in the
GHQ, and a meal give up in the Din-
ing Hall. These events plus the dance
will help the Committee to reach its
goal of a $25,000 donation to
Muscular Dystrophy.

Trustees approve 2% tuition raise

New faculty needed to remain competitive with other schools

 

By Elizabeth Parkins
Tri-Editor

 

All full-time undergraduate and law
students can expect to pay 2 percent
more next year on their tuition bill,
President Wilson says.

In a letter to all students and
parents, which will be sent out in the
next few days, Wilson explains that
tuition will rise next year to $10,100
for undergraduates and $10,300 for
law students.

“Frankly, I recommended a major
increase in tuition in 1989-90 to per-
mit the University to add a series of
key faculty positions and to bring fa-
culty compensation and academic
program support to a level commen-
surate with the University’s peer in-
Stitutions,’’ Wilson writes.

New faculty positions would be
added in Japanese and Russian lan-
guage and literature, politics,
American history, Spanish, art
history, and in the law school. The
new staff would ‘‘secure new areas of

competence and keep class and section
size from growing,’’ writes Wilson. |

Wilson wanted a major increase in
order to finance these changes. At the

same time however, he and the Board
of Trustees realized that the large ad-
justment could cause problems for
some students.

with other leading American colleges

kept its tuition schedule at the lowest
possible level. We have been proud of
this record and will continue to resist
all but essential adjustments,’’ Wilson

behind other institutions. In order for
W&L to remain competitive with
other colleges the salary gap must be
closed Wilson said.

“The fact of the matter is that
without quite realizing it, we have
been asking our faculty to subsidize
our low tuition. By this I mean to

point out that in the current year our
tuition is between three and four thou-
sand dollars lower than the tuition of
Amherst, Bowdoin, Bucknell,

Carleton, Oberlin, Duke, Pomona,
Swarthmore and Wesleyan,”’ writes
Wilson.

Currently, a large portion of the
University’s operating budget is
covered by tuition. The rest is covered
by endowment returns and by gifts

from alumni, parents, foundations and
friends. Next year however, tuition

must cover an increased portion of the
budget.

“It carries a clear message that we
must, in the near future, add substan-
tially to the permanent endowment
and the gift income of Washington and
Lee. Only in this way can we maintain

a reasonable balance between tuition
and all other sources of the funds re-
quired to provide superior educational
opportunities for the young people
who matriculate here,’’ concludes
Wilson.

SAB faces obstacles
in scheduling bands

 

By Pat Lopes
Staff Reporter

 

With the Phi Kap, KA, SAE and Phi
Delt house bands battling it out
followed by Indecision on Friday
night, and Wild Grass, the triumphant
battle band and Indecision warming up
the crowd for the Connells on Satur-
day night, Superdance has an im-
pressive line up that’s bound to attract
crowds.

Unfortunately, recent SAB concerts
have failed to fill the pavilion. When
people talk on Monday morning about

dismal turnout on a weekend night,

inevitably the conversation turns to

the SAB’s choice of bands. A lot of
people wonder why the SAB is unable

to get better known bands for
Homecoming, Christmas Weekend
and other big weekends.

W&L limitations form the obstacle.

Overcoming obstacles to get the best
band possible is the job of SAB Enter-
tainment Director Judy Payne. Payne
books groups for SAB events in-
cluding Wednesday night bands at the
GHQ.

Budget is an obvious challenge for

Payne. Although it seems that students
pay a substantial activities fee, $50 a
student spread over a year and a
number of student organizations is
obviously not going to cover the bill
for U2.

For good quality bands well known

in the East, money isn’t the problem,
according to Payne. ‘‘Money doesn’t
always talk in this business,”’
said.

she

A more severe challenge is the time

of year an event occurs. Bands nor-
mally tour during the fall and the spr-
ing, devoting the rest of the year to
bandkeeping tasks, such as recording,
regrouping, recovering and song
writing. So, booking Christmas con-
certs are difficult because of the
season.

Seasonal limitations aside, day of
the week inflexibility is another
challenge for Payne. She can’t offer
any date options to bands. Payne has
to match tour plans with specific
scheduled dates, which cuts down the
number of options open to the SAB.

Rescheduling concert dates is
difficult. Time is of the essence.
While SAB tries to conquer the W&L
bureaucracy, the band can be lost.

For example, *‘Little Feat’’ offered
to play on the Thursday instead of the
Friday before Christmas Weekend,
1988. The OK for a concert during the
school week was stalled. By time the
SAB got an all clear signal, the band
was booked

W&L’s location is another
challenge. Groups often can’t place
Lexington, Virginia on the map, ac-
cording to Payne. Once the bands
know where Lexington is, they then
have to be persuaded to deviate from
the beaten track between cities like
Charlottesville and Chapel Hill.

W&L students do have the oppor-
tunity to see and hear rising talent on
campus. ‘‘T try to pick the bands on
the up and up,”’ said Payne. REM and
the Violent Femmes played here three
years ago, when they were up and
coming. Payne continued, *‘Listening
to new groups, that’s what college
music is all about.””
OPINION

Defending a
Decision

 

Last week a letter to the editor appeared on the front page of the
Phi in which a student claimed to have been sexually harassed by

_,one of her professors.

The letter has since provoked a great deal of controversy on cam-
pus. That was one of our reasons for printing the letter, because we
“want members of the W&L community to be aware that sexual
. harassment is here (too many people carry the attitude that ‘‘Yeah,

it happens, but not here.’’).

We feel it necessary to further defend our decision to print the

‘letter.

As journalists, we have learned to investigate everything. Our

. journalistic ethics won't allow us ever to print something we
thought bogus. In this particular case, more sources were contacted
than were identified (and we'll leave it at that). The articles and

__ letter that appeared last week are not the result of poor journalism,
"but rather some poor interpretations by some members of the W&L

community.

We would also like to dispell some false rumors that have been
“circulating. NO, none of the journalism professors know who the
letter-writer or professor is. NO, we did not write the letter
ourselves. NO, the entire Phi staff does not know who the letter-
writer or professor is. NO, we did not select Marie Dunne to write
the sexual harassment article because she graduated in December
and would not have to deal with the repercussions (in fact, we wish

she could take some of them for us).

Our only regret is that some people are more concerned with fin-
ding out who the letter-writer and professor are than with the reality

of sexual harassment. We hope that will change.

To the Editors:

Thank you for publishing last week’s stories on
the subject of sexual harassment. It is dismaying
to learn that we have, apparently, not been spared
this unhappy feature of contemporary life in this
country. But it is just as well that we know as
much as we can about what is happening here and
to take every opportunity to apply the University’s
policies in a just and yet decisive way.

To the Editors:

I write with reference to the front page story in
the Ring-tum Phi last week. The headline **Sexual
harassment is a reality at W&L"’ is not supported
by the text of the article. Upon reading the story, I
discover that the only supporting evidence is an
anonymous letter from an anonymous student
stating that an unnamed professor had asked her to
sleep with him. Also three of her anonymous male
friends had been propositioned by unnamed
homosexual professors.

This story is an offense to every male professor
at W&L, because it places everyone of us under
suspicion. Even before the story was published,

Beware, all female students!$

To the Editors:

‘At first, I did not know how to react to your
recent editorial, ‘‘Recognizing Male Issues,”’ par-
ticularly its jolly little justification of the crime of
rape. I fear that I reacted initially with some
anger. It occurred to me that your readers might
be confused into believing that the criminal law

izes some special, minor misdemeanor en-
titled ‘‘date rape’’, when in fact rape is a serious
felony whether committed on a stranger or on a
date, whether perpetrated in a dorm room or in a
alley. Rape is rape and it is punishable in Virginia
by up to life in prison. My anger extended to the
writer of the editorial, who informs us that Mr.
Schenk has some very good points, but lacks the

Letters

We simply cannot tolerate the sexual abuse of
any member of this community, male or female,
faculty, staff or student. As I tried to say in my
Founders’ Day remarks, I hope all of us will
renew our efforts to keep clear and relevant the
overarching values of this University—and to find
ways to apply them in our everyday lives. I am
thinking especially of Lee’s powerful commit-
ment to the idea of human dignity and thus the

your editorial staff had leaked its contents.
Students, faculty, staff, and National Enquirer
readers are now curious as to the identity of the
lecherous professors. Students have asked me
‘‘who is it?’’ Other students have read through the
faculty register trying to guess who it is. In addi-
tion, people are wondering who wrote the letter,
and this is not fair to all upperclass female
students.

Washington and Lee has instituted procedures
by which students can report incidents of sexual
harassment whether by other students or by facul-
ty, If this anonymous letter writer was truly a vic-
tim, she should have used these procedures and

courage to state whether the writer shares’ Mr.
Schenk’s views or believes the reader should do
so. On reflection, I realized that I was reacting
like the Myopic Intolerant Fanatical Feminist Mr. -
Schenk would undoubtedly label me.

I thought again and realized that your recent
editorial is in fact an accurate and needed warning
for women students at Washington & Lee. If I
may be so bold as to restate the warning, it is this.

Beware, all women students!

There are men at Washington & Lee so arrogant
and self- centered that they believe they have the
right to treat you as a prostitute -- no, worse,as an
object with no feelings, will or moral values of
your own. Beware, there are men here who

   

Sexual harassment is affront to Honor Code

need to treat others in ways which always respect
and honor that dignity. It would be an inestimable
loss to Washington and Lee if we, in our time,
become content merely to pay lip-service to Lee’s
Code and lose utterly its content.

Sincerely,
John D. Wilson
President.

Anonymous letters cause unfair suspicions

the editors of the Phi should have referred the
letter to the Dean of Students Office.

Sexual harassment is an affront to all honorable
men and women, and faculty, staff, and students
who are guilty of such harassment need to be
disciplined and, in severe cases, should be remov-
ed from W&L. However appropriate action
cannot be taken through writing and publishing
anonymous letters, the main effect of which is to
cause many honorable professors to be under
suspicion.

Roger Dean
Associate Professor of Administration

believe that the price of a hamburger and a movie
ticket buys them an irrevocable license to rape
you. Beware, there are men here who will
understand your embrace, not as a loving gesture
to be treasured, but as an invitation to rape. These
men are not worthy of your time, your trust or
your tenderness. .

Be careful out there!

In summary, I write to thank the editorial writer
for the great service of the warning our women
students at Washington & I ee.

Yours in Fanatical Feminism,
Joan M. Shaughnessy
Assistant Professor of Law

W & L P.E. requirements need restructuring

An Open Letter to the Washington and Lee Com-
munity:

Washington and Lee University prides itself on
the great amount of self-government that its
students are given. In light of this fact, it is impor-
tant that the University community be informed of
a proposed change in the physical education grad-
uation requirement.

As part of a campus-wide self-study, a five per-
son committee consisting of Athletic Department
personnel decided that the physical education re-
quirement, specifically in reference to inter-
collegiate athletes, should be changed. They felt
that a new policy could better reflect the diverse,
liberal arts focus of the University.

In order to ‘‘allow’’ a more diverse exposure to
the world of physical fitness and recreation, the
committee suggests that the maximum fraction of
a credit hour allowed for each varsity sport a stu-
dent participates in should be reduced from two-
fifths to one-fifth. This change would mean that
two, three, or even four years of varsity participa-
tion would garner the W&L student- athlete a
paltry 1/Sth credit, leaving four more P.E. classes
needed for graduation.

This move, at a school that has a long and rich
athletic tradition, as well as a 25% rate of inter-
collegiate athletic participation among its current
student body, would be a travesty. This proposed
policy change not only greatly limits the student-

athlete in his choice of when not to enroll in non-
varsity P.E. classes, it also fails to recognize the
diverse gains made from intercollegiate-level
training and competition.

The student-athlete at W&L is the student who
is internally motivated to participate in athletics.
He or she is the person who will be involved in
physical activity for the rest of their life. These
young adults have established, through years of
dedication and self-motivation, the desire to stay
physically fit, and to participate in a wide spec-
trum of invigorating activities.

These student-athletes, who spend many hours
each week involved in a variety of physical ac-
tivities, do not need to be ‘‘allowed’’ to explore
the variety of the school’s offerings. The liberal
arts emphasis of W&L is embodied in the student-
athlete. The Athletic Department’s goal of a stu-
dent body that is well-versed in motor skills and
fitness, rules and strategy, and good sportsman-
ship, has already been ingrained in the student-
athlete.

We, the undersigned student-athletes, as well as
other members of the W&L community, support
an alternative solution that would serve not only
the student-athlete, but also benefit the general
student, and the Athletic Department itself:

1) Allow 1/5th a credit for the first season of
each varsity sport in which the student-athlete par-
ticipates. (Each student would still need to accu-
mulate 5/Sths cr. hr.)

2) For each subsequent season, in each sport,
give the student-athlete one credit hour of graded
participation, up to a total of nine credits. (8 cr.
hrs. + 5/Scr. hr. = 9 cr. hrs.)

The W&L student participates in intercollegiate
athletics for many reasons, primarily because they
want to. The beneficial growing experiences that
the student-athlete receives adds a whole new
dimension to his or her education. The positive
exposure the University receives through their
success is as valuable to W&L as the research,
writing, and performances done in other areas.

If the University feels so strongly that physical
education is important to a liberal arts education
that it makes frequent participation a requirement,
then the University should accord the Department
of Athletics equal status with the rest of the cam-
pus.

It is time that the student-athlete, as well as the
Athletic Department’s physical education offer-
ings, be given the credits they deserve. The Uni-
versity should assemble a group, comprised of
students, student-athletes, and faculty members,
to discuss this proposal. More importantly the
administration should pay attention to what the
students, and the University community, feel is
best for the future of Washington & Lee!

Sincerely,
Stu Sheldon 89

Statistics deemed “‘irresponsible journalism”’

To the editors:

A bit of easy but irresponsible journalism
popped up in our paper on Jan. 19, 1989, when it
highlighted some significant statistics gleaned
from the Registrar’s Report: Chinese gave the
most A +’s (28.1 percent), while Russian the most
F's (10 percent).

Statistics!

But everyone knows that percentages churned
out with no regard to sample size are less than ir-
relevant—they re downright misleading. One stu-
dent in a class of ten who forgets to fill out his
drop slip will hopelessly skew the score. In the
same breath, the reporter might have seized upon
the whopping (!) 65 percent of students who got
A’s and B’s in that class.

Of the hundreds of statistics displayed in the
Report, here’s one: ‘‘Out of 2,015 history
students, less than one percent (.007) received a
failing grade.’’ Now that would be a statistically
significant statistic (which would at the same time
increase our History enrollments...).

Students thank King Celebration supporters

To the Editors:

On behalf of the Minority Student Association,
I would like to express my sincere thanks to every
area resident, staff person, student, faculty
member, and administrator for joining us at the
First Baptist Church on Monday, January 16 for a
celebration of the life of Martin Luther King, Jr.

I would also like to thank those of you who sup-
ported us in our endeavor to publicize the pro-

gram and involve the W&L community.

The wise and encouraging words from, our
speaker, Ms. Louise Coleman, will surely remain
embedded in our hearts and minds for many
years.

It is the fervent desire of the Minority Student
Association that a celebration of Dr. King’s life
and achievements such as this one will become a
traditional and annual event in which people of all
races, backgrounds, and religious beliefs will

freely partake.

Sincerely,

Military novelists
will visit VMI

From Staff Reports

 

Novels of war and of the tech-
nological complexities of modern
military machinery have been smash
hits on the best-seller lists of the
1980’s, and next week, Virginia
Military Institute will have a hit of its
own when it is hosts to four of the
most popular current writers of novels
about modern-day warfare and the
people who fight those military fan-
tasies.

Novelists Tom Clancy, Stephen
Coonts, Harold Coyle and W.E.B.
Griffin will visit VMI together over
the Feb. 8-10 period, and on Thursday
evening, Feb. 9, they will appear in a
panel discussion in Jackson Memorial
Hall. The 8 p.m. program on ‘‘The
Fiction of War** is open to the public
and will include a question and answer
period with the audience.

The four authors will be available
Friday, Feb. 10, to autograph copies
of their books at a book-signing recep-
tion to be held in Lejeune Hall from
1:30 to 3:30 p.m. It is also open to the
public.

Clancy, author of The Hunt for Red
October (1984), Red Storm Rising
(1986), Patriot Games (1987), and
The Cardinal of the Kremlin (1988),
all best sellers, is the owner of a
Maryland insurance agency and a self-
described technology freak. His
books, which have sold by the
millions, are military thrillers full of
high-tech gadgetry of modern
weapons systems and the alarming
plots of future world wars.

Coonts, a 1968 graduate of West

Virginia University, where he also
received a Navy commission, is the
author of Flight of Intruder (1986) and
Final Flight (1988). After earning his
Navy wings, he flew A-6 bombers in
southeast Asia from 1971 to 1973. By
the end of his tour he had accumulated
1600 hours in the Intruder and logged
305 arrested carrier landings, more
than 100 of them at night. Holder of
the Distinguished Flying Cross, he is
today an attorney in Denver, Colo.,
and a commander in the Naval Air Re-
serve.

Coyle, a 1974 graduate of VMI and
a U.S. Army major stationed with the
First Cavalry Division at Fort Hood,
Texas, is the author of Team Yankee
(1987) and Sword Point (1988). An
armor officer since his graduation
from VMI, Coyle knows about
soldiering and tanks. He is currently
the operations officer with a tank-
heavy, combined arms task force.

Griffin, a pseudonym used by
writer William E. Butterworth Il of
Fairhope, Ala., is the author of the
seven novels in the Brotherhood of
War series (1983-86) and of several
books in the series on the Marine
Corps called The Corps (1985-87), in-
cluding Semper Fi and Call to Arms.
An Army veteran of Korean War ser-
vice and a former combat correspon-
dent, he is a career writer whose ex-
tensive publications also include
several dozen children’s books. A
best-seller author since 1968, he is a
member of the Alabama Academy of
Distinguished Authors.

While at VMI, the four popular
novelists will also address cadets dur-
ing English department class periods.

Solar-powered car

By Brian Root
Staff Reporter

 

The solar-powered car that won a
1950-mile race across Australia in
1987 is capable of speeds of up to 70
miles an hour, said one of the car’s
designers last week in a speech at the
Virginia Military Institute.

The car, which was built by a sub-
sidiary of General Motors, requires
only about .7 kilowatts to operate the
electric engine; said Dr. Floyd Wyc-
zalek to an audience of about 60 peo-

ple on Jan. 26. A normal, gasoline-
fueled car needs about 12 kilowatts of
power.

“*You must realize the enormous
amount of power we have, consider-
ing the small amount of energy we had
to work with,’’ said Wyczalek.

The car, called the Sunraycer, won
the World Solar Challenge in October
of 1987. The Challenge is a race
across the entire continent of Australia
which is open only to. solar-powered
cars.

The Sunraycer averaged about 66

Plan for careers |
in New York City

Career office arranges program
to meet alumni contacts

 

By Heidi Read
Tri-Editor

 

The Career Development and
Placement Office has arranged a
“‘pilot’’ program for seniors to meet
alumni contacts in New York City
over Washington Holiday.

The first of its kind, the program
called Career Connections: New York
is designed to hook up seniors with
alumni in New York who are prospec-
tive employers or who can direct
seniors to the right people in their job
search, said Dean N. Rick Heatley,
director of the Career Development
and Placement Office.

Starting with a reception on Mon-
day, Feb. 13, alumni will be available
to socialize, share information and
discuss career opportunities in a varie-
ty of fields. Some of the career fields
that are being represented are finan-
cial services (all banking opportunities
and insurance), public relations,
advertising and marketing, broad-
casting, journalism and publishing,
non-profit and public sector, interna-
tional business, sales, arts manage-
ment and museums, paralegal, ac-
counting, real estate and others.

Seniors may submit resumes before
break to participating alumni or set up

travels by the speed of light

kilometers an hour (about 43 m.p.h)
in the six days of the race. It defeated
the second-place car, built by Ford,
by several days and the last-place car,
built by Mitsubishi, by an entire mon-
th.

Of the 24 cars that entered the race,
only 13 finished.

In order to reach such high speeds,
said Wyczalek, the car had to be very

ortight anshaerodynamic. The car, with

dviver, weighed only 511 pounds.

“‘The'whole car can be easily pick-
ed up by two people,’’ Wyczalek said.

Concerts aren’t just for tourists

By Lori Richardson
Staff Reporter

 

During the tourist off-season,
January through March, the Lex-
ington Visitor Center is featuring local
singers and musical groups in weekly
concerts to attract local people to the
new center and entertain tourists.

Every Wednesday afternoon at the
new East Washington Street location,
where the Centel office was located,
tourists and local citizens can hear a
flute ensemble, chamber singers or a
handbell choir, said Betty Jo Lee, who
works at the new Visitor Center.

According to Jean Tardy Clark, the
tour coordinator at the center, ‘Local

people are the last to see the local
sites. They will travel miles and miles
to see sites, but not the ones in their
own backyard. The concerts en-
courage the local people to see the
new center and see the differences
with the old one. Some people have
probably never been to either center.”’

“Last week 35 people came to
listen. Yesterday there were about 25
people and only two were visitors to
Lexington. The rest were local,”’ said
Lee.

Clark said the ‘‘nice’’ attendance
has probably been aided by the beau-
tiful weather. The center sent out an-
nouncements to Rockbridge residents
to tell them about the concert series.
Word of mouth and ads in the local

paper brought some people in, too,
she said.

Lee said the performers are from
the Rockbridge area and some
students participate in the local
groups.

According to Lee, ‘‘Local people
who work don’t have to give up their
whole lunch hour and visitors won’t

have to lose a whole hour if they want”

to attend one of our concerts.’ The
two January concerts each lasted
about 20 minutes.

Next week, the ‘‘Chocolate F Con-
sort’ will perform recorder and lute
music of the Renaissance and Baroque
periods. A schedule is available at the

~ new Visitor Center.

What worried the designers the
most, said Wyczalek, was that a stong
crosswind could easily flip the car
over, which happened to several of the
entrants. A large truck could pass the
Sunraycer and overturn it, but it never
happened.

**We were certainly very lucky,”’
said Wyczalek. ‘‘Our biggest problem
was three flat tires, which was far
fewer than we expected to:get in a
week.”’ :

The project, which was staffed only
by volunteers, spent eight months

preparing the car and the plan for the
race.

“This system was planned just like
you'd plan a NASA launch,’’ said
Wyczalek.

In addition to the Sunraycer, the en-
tourage included a communications
truck, a telemetry van, which moni-
tored the car’s performance, a
replacement car, and satellite com-
munications equipment.

Although the car averaged about 43
m.p.h. during the race, Wyczalek
said, the car did reach about 70 m.p.h.

interview times at the reception. But
Heatley said to plan on remaining 19
New York for a few days to follow up
on any leads that resulted from the re-
ception. He said a binder will be
available in the Career Development
Office that posts the position descrip-
tions supplied by participating alumni
so that seniors can get background in-
formation on companies.

The alumni connection has proved
to be a ‘‘wonderful network for
aiding seniors in their job search,
Heatley said.

Heatley said he hopes to organize
other Career Connections programs in
other major cities if it proves to be a
valuable recruiting outlet. ‘‘It’s a way
to hook up with alumni in major cities
and get your foot in the door. The
possibilities are endless,”’ he said.

He predicts a good response from
both alumni and students, but stressed
the importance of stating target areas,
or job descriptions and objectives.

However, since plans need to be
finalized, Heatley said that seniors,
and juniors interested in internships,

need to make reservations soon. ‘‘If
you want to tap into it (the alumni
connections) you need to hook up
now, otherwise we'll have trouble
making an alumni match,”’ he said.

while qualifying for the event.

Unfortunately, said Wyczalek,
solar-powered cars are not yet feasible
for mass-production.

“The truth is, they’re just too ex-
pensive to build,’’ said Wyc:
zalek.‘*The materials are too rare and
expensive.”

Wyczalek said that the Sunraycer
may be brought to Lexington for pub-
lic view in April or May, although it is
not yet definite.

 

 

Missert wins ROTC award

 

From Staff Reports

 

A 1988 W&L graduate was
awarded the Army Achievement
Medal Tuesday in a ceremony at
the Military Science Department.

Lieutenant Jon Missert earned
the award while serving as the
department’s Gold Bar Recruiter
since his graduation last June.
Missert was able to spent his first
six months after graduation here
under a program that allows
graduates to serve as ROTC

recruiters at their alma maters.

Missert was cited in the award
for his meritorious service and his
“‘outstanding initiative in develop-
ing programs to inform the student
body about the ROTC program,’’
said Joel Snow, professor of
military science.

During his six months he has
worked in all areas of recruiting,
especially with incoming
freshmen. Through mailing cam-
paigns and personal visits to high
schools Lt. Missert has ‘‘single-
handedly increased the awareness

of Army ROTC on campu: and put ,
together a high school recruiting
program,’’ said Capt. Ramon
Ramos, Missert’s supervisor.

According to Missert, the Gold
Bar experience has ‘‘been an ex-
cellent transition from college to
life as a professional officer.’’ He
will be attending the Field Artillery
Officer Basic Course at Fort Sill,
OK. from February to July. He
will then be stationed at Fort
Bragg, N.C., in an airborne ar-
tillery unit.

(continued from page 2)

The history of anti-semitism is a
long and complex one. The Jews have
been persecuted as money-grubbing
Christ-killers for centuries. As re-
vered a figure as the Protestant
reformer, Martin Luther, hated them
and recommended their synagogues
be burned. Programs and govern-
ment-encouraged massacres of Jews
were almost commonplace in Eastern
Europe and especially Russia into the
20th century. With the advent of
super-nationalist sentiment in the late
19th century organized anti-Semitic
movements sprouted up like
mushrooms. In supposedly enlighten-
ed 1890’s France, an officer named
Dreyfus was falsely accused of es-
pionage owing to his Judaism, an
event which became a world cause
celebre. Jews were universally denied
social privileges which were accorded
ordinary Gentiles in Western Europe,
and were outright persecuted in Cen-
tral and Eastern Europe up to the 20th
century. Even in liberal Britain, the
brilliant prime minister, Benjamin
Disraeli (originally D’Israli), could
have embarked on no political career
had he not been baptized beforehand.

Still, some of the most ardent anti-
semitic agitation took place between,
roughly, 1870 and 1914 in Germany
and (ethnically German) Austria-
Hungary. Philosophical and political
movements such as Georg von
Schonerer’s Pan-Germans and
Richard Wagner Circle harped on the
Jewish menace to German ethnic soli-
darity and survival, and many rec-
ommended their destruction. The
reasons for why an intellectual move-
ment developed in opposition to the
Jewish race are manifold, but to a
great degree these Volkish (ultra-
German) thinkers resented what they

PEE CeEECU LUELLA LLL

perceived as Jewish-inspired  in-

dustrialism, which threatened the

German aesthetic spirit. Also, in an

extremely nationalist age, the Jews

seemed rootless, nationless, and even
conspiratorial, and thus hateful.
Regardless, anti-Semitism was so in
vogue by the turn of the century that
the Viennese mayor, Karl Lueger, es-
poused it in order to enhance his own
popularity. Hitler assembled the ideas
of a myriad of these German (and
some non-German) _ intellectuals,
stirred in his own experiences, and
came up with his ‘‘final solution of the

Jewish problem.”’

Once war and then the Holocaust
became reality, Hitler turned to his
Satellite nations for aid in the
“‘cleansing’’ of Jew-infested Europe.
This is a very convoluted issue
because, although most governments
co-operated, motivations are difficult
to assess. After all, did Italy,
Hungary, Bulgaria, et.al. turn over
Jews to the Nazis out of anti-Semitism
or just plain fear of Hitler’s wrath?
Still, upon receipt of groups of Jewish
deportees from Germany, the satellite
government of Vichy France promptly
sent them back to the Reich. Evident-
ly, Vichy regarded the threat of Nazi
punishment as preferable to accepting
more Jews onto French soil.

As time passes, the memory of the
events of the Holocaust is unlikely to
pass from the long-term memory of
mankind. Yet its meaning can and, to
some extent, has. It probably makes
us feel better to pin the blame on
Hitler, who is difficult to understand
and easy to hate. Some guilt-ridden
liberal apologists have alternately
gotten into the habit of blaming the
West, and chiefly the United States,
for not doing something to help the
Jews, a premise which is difficult to
put much stock in. Establishing blame
in an event as devastating as the
Holocaust does not change its grim
outcome. We can merely attempt to
understand its antecedents so as to
avert the next one.

classic sit-com, allow me to bring you
up to date. The Brady Bunch is about a
man (Mr. Brady), three sons (Greg,
Peter and Bobby) and a housekeeper
(Alice) who re-marries a woman
(Mrs. Brady) with three daughters
(Marcia, Jan and Cindy) . This motley
group lives together in a suburban
home with artificial grass. Note: Do
not confuse the Brady Bunch with the
Partridge Family. The Partridge Fam-
ily are dope-smoking musicians who
drive around in a tie-dye bus singing
songs about life. While Brady Bunch
episodes over the years have generally
informed viewers about the nature of
the Brady psyche, there are still some
unanswered questions. Actually, there
are exactly three unanswered ques-
tions:

1.) Does Alice (the housekeeper)
favor the Brady boys over the Brady
girls since she lived with them longer?

2.) Did rising levels of male hor-
mones in the puberty- driven bodies of
Greg and Peter compound with the
short sexy mini-skirts worn by Marcia
and Jan result in any type of sexual re-
lationship between these unrelated
siblings?

3.) And finally, where did the
Brady’s purchase all of their funky
garb?

Unfortunately, there are no black
and white answers to these crucial
Brady questions. Normally, I would
satisfy curious readers by making up
my own answers like ‘‘The family
buys all of their clothes at the
Polyester Thrift Shop’’, but due to
space limitations | am compelled to

 

move on to yet another fascinating
Brady Bunch topic: The 1988 Brady
Bunch Christmas Reunion special was
shown in December.

First the plot summary: the Brady
kids, now grown up and wearing
modern clothes and living in obscure
parts of the world, come back to the
house with artificial grass where they
grew up to spend Christmas with
Mom, Dad and Alice. While the kids
have been gone for the last 15 years,
Dad has kept his job as an architect
and Alice and Mom kept busy getting
rid of the shag carpet and the velvet
bed spreads.

Now the editorial comment: The
most consistent character was Greg
(the oldest son). The grown up Greg
was as nerdy as the young Greg. Gen-
erally, everyone turned out to be
much uglier and not nearly as likeable
as adults. Except for Cindy who look-
ed more like a Playboy centerfold than
a Brady. True Brady Bunch fans like
my brother-in-law, Herb, could tell
right away that Cindy was a fake
(pseudoCindy) planted there by the
producers to get the better ratings.
The highlight of the Christmas dinner
was when Bobby (the youngest son)
stood up and announced that he
dropped out of graduate school and
was now a race car driver.

Finally the climax: Dad had to leave
in the middle of dinner because
workers at a building he designed
were at work (on Christmas day)
when the building collapsed. Dad,
relying on his knowledge, experience
and modern hairdo, succeeded in res-
cuing the workers, but in the process
the building shifted and he was
trapped. While viewers anxiously
waited to see if Mr. Brady would get
out of the building, the whole- Brady
clan behind the police barricade
started singing Christmas songs like
‘*Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer’
until Dad miraculously emerged.

The Ring-tum Phi, February 2, 1989

 

Cagers continue their winning ways

 

By Jay Plotkin
Staff Reporter

They say you don’t know what you've got until it’s
gone.

Well, the Washington and Lee basketball team
now knows what it has in the friendly confines of
the Warner Center. They now know the feeling of
playing in front of hostile crowds like the ones at
Hampden-Sydney and Bridgewater. And they now

. , know what it takes to win on the road.
The Generals showed what it takes last Thursday
‘at Emory and Henry in a conference showdown
, between the Old Dominion Athletic Conference's
top two teams.

What it took was a little Hart—sophomore for-
ward Ed Hart that is— and a lot of tough, scrappy
team defense. Hart continued his consistent assault
on opponents and got support from his mates in the
, tough 62-57 win at Emory and Henry. He scored 11
’ points and grabbed five rebounds to help lead the
way for the Generals.

Senior captain Lee Brading led the team in scor-
‘ing by pumping in 14 while snaring five boards.
_ Reserve center John Witherington also played well,

scoring six points and pulling down five rebounds
‘in his first extended stretch of playing time. Said
, head coach Verne Canfield on the freshman, **As I
recall, John Witherington was in there when we
’ were [ getting two and three shots a trip], and that’s
_always nice when you can put a kid in the ballgame
and he does something constructive.’’ Witherington
‘had two baskets off offensive rebounds in the first
half.

But the man the Generals went to down the stret-
ich was sophomore center Chris Jacobs. Jacobs
_came off the bench to score 12 points in second
‘half, including four of four free throws in the final

‘

minute to put the game away, and grab seven re-
bounds. ‘*Chris showed what a man he was tonight.
He had about five key rebounds in the end where he
ripped the ball off and only gave them one shot, and
that was great,”’ said Canfield after the win.

On Saturday, the Generals returned home to the
Warner Center to take on Lynchburg College.

Said sophomore guard Jim Casey before the
game, ‘‘We’re just glad to be back playing at
home.”’

And were they ever. This one was over shortly
after the starters were introduced. After Lyn-
chburg’s Tom Kalucki scored to tie the game at
two, the Generals exploded on a 20-2 run sparked
by Jacobs and Brading. When Brading hit a three
pointer with 2:54 left in the half, the lead was 20 at
38-18. Lynchburg closed to 41-30 at the half, but
never got any closer the rest of the way.

The Generals started the second half with a 23-5
run capped by three pointers from sophomore
guards Pat Gallavan and Mike Holton to make it 64-
35, and the Generals cruised to a 90-59 win to move
to 8-1 in ODAC play.

Brading paced the Generals with 20 points and
nine rebounds. The 20 points equalled his career
high. Jacobs added 16 points while Casey pumped
in 10. Witherington came off the bench to score a
career-high eight points, his second big game in a
row. Brading has emerged as the team leader of
late, and his 20 points marked the fourth time in his
last five games in which he led the team in scoring.

Canfield said the leadership has been expected.
‘*You expect it of a senior, and we expect it of the
one we finally refer to as ‘Pops.’ That is the kind of
leadership Lee can give. He is a leader in the sense
of doing {things on the court], and he is providing
us with some excellent leadership.”’

On Tuesday night, the Generals entertained non-
conference foe Guilford, an NAIA school. It was
rumored that Guilford had 17 dunks in the first half

against Lynchburg. Well...who knows?

The first half started out well for the Generals
with some good and bad news. First, the good.
Jacobs scored the Generals’ first 10 points of the
game on 5-5 shooting. As for the bad, Brading was
whistled for two quick fouls in the first two
minutes. When Hart scored with 11:52 left, the
score was 17-13 W&L. Guilford then went on a 7-0
run sparked by Tyra Parson's dunk with 10:10 left.
The Quakers led by as many as seven (28- 21) in the
first half, led by Parson's 15 points—including four
slam dunks—but the Generals tied the score at 39
when sophomore forward Scott Alrutz scored with
five seconds remaining.

The second half started with two straight
Gallavan three pointers, and the Generals led 45-
42. The second three pointer was the fifth bomb
made by the Generals, a good sign for the W&L
faithful. The Generals are 11-0 when they have
made at least five three pointers.

After Guilford tied the score at 60, Gallavan
scored on a driving lay up to give the Generals the
lead for good with 10:26 left. Hart added 11 of his
team-high 19 points in the second half, including
two straight baskets to make the score 76-70.
Gallavan finished with 15 points off the bench to
spark the Generals, and his two free throws with 38
seconds left drove the final nail in the coffin on an
88-79 come-from-behind victory.

Hart led the way for W&L with 19 points and
nine rebounds. Jacobs finished with 16 points, and
Alrutz scored a career-high 12.

**T just asked myself who played a good game,”’
said Canfield. ‘‘Everybody did something to help
with that win.”

Next up for the 15-3 Generals is Emory & Henry

tonight in the Warner Center (Temple of Doom) at
7:30 in a rematch of last week's conference
showdown. The game will be broadcasted live on
91.5 WLUR-FM.

For Washington and Lee wrestling
head coach Gary Franke and his team,
(Tuesday’s match against Gustavus
Adolphus in Doremus Gymnasium
‘must have been like Christmas,
Thanksgiving, and April Fools Day
- all rolled into one. The Generals, who
shave battled injuries, inexperience,
ind an overall lack of participating
; wrestlers in losing five of their first

 

weight classes, bringing us to the 167-
pound class, where Franke juggled his
lineup slightly, moving freshman Peer
Soderberg up from 158. ‘‘It’s a tem-
porary move,” said Franke. ‘‘We
don’t really have a 167, but they
didn’t have many people so we wanted
to give them a match [instead of
forfeiting].””

It would turn out to be easily the
best match of the night as Soderberg
held on to win 3-2, picking up the
deciding point on the basis of more
riding time.

about Adolphus, as Franke admitted,
its likely the visitors had no idea what
they were getting into with senior
Rich Redfoot in the 190-pound class.
Redfoot, who has appeared more like
Bigfoot at times in rolling up an
outstanding 13-1-1 mark this year,
would pin his man with a scant second

**He’s got a lot of God-given ability
and a lot of experience,’ Franke said.
‘*He’s the superior wrestler on the

For the better part of the last
three months, the Washington and
Lee basketball team has been
taking to the floor rather suc-
cessfully. This week, The Ring-
tum Phi honors one of the quiet
members of the team as Athlete-of-
the-Month for January.

Although he hasn’t put up the
greatest numbers on the team, he
has been the glue that holds the
team together. His consistent play
has been one of the focal points of
‘thacoffelSive attack, and of late, he
hp¢ beerf one of the main reasons
that the Generals are 15-3 and 8-1
in the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference.

Edward Hart, a 6’5’’ sophomore
forward from San Antonio, Texas,
is January’s Ring-tum Phi Athlete-
of-the-Month. Since the Generals
have been back from Christmas
Break, Hart has picked up his
game. He has scored in double fig-
ures in nine of his last 10 games,
averaging 15.1 points per game
over the stretch, including a career
high 23 against Eastern Men-
nonite.

When Hart came back this
season, he found out that he had a
new role that required him to make
some adjustments, but he feels he’s
made the transition. Said Hart,
‘Originally, I was kind of ad-
justing to my new role of three

 

 

 

Ed Hart

[small forward] as opposed to
four[power forward]. I played four
most of last year. I came back after
break realizing it was more-ofan
opportunity than a bad thing. Itf¥a
lot more fun playing on_ the
perimeter, and I think I’m getting
better on my perimeter defense. I
have worked on my outside shot.’

Hart has adjusted well to his new
role. He is among the ODAC
leaders in shooting percentage,
connecting at a 57 percent clip. He
is second on the team in scoring
and rebounding, averaging 12.9
points and 5.9 rebounds per con-
test. He is also one of the team’s
better free throw shooter’s at 75.9
percent.

Right now, Hart doesn’t have a
set plan for life after graduation.
“I’m just taking it one step at a
time. I’m just kind of excited about
this year in general.”

Congratulations to Ed Hart, The
Ring-Tum Phi’s Athlete-of- the-
Month for January.

The Washington and Lee women’s
swim team breezed past Hollins last
night, 124-78, in an Old Dominion
Athletic Conference meet on the road.

The victory puts the Generals in ex-
cellent position to defend their ODAC
title of a year ago.

‘*That makes us undefeated in the
ODAC dual competitions and will set
the stage to defend our ODAC cham-
pionship title,’’ said head coach Page
Remillard. The win comes after some
excellent swims turned in by W&L
over the past weekend. Two more
school records were posted by the
Generals. The ‘women “competed
against Shepherd College and Get-
tysburg last week and broke a record
at each meet.

Seniors Elizabeth Miles and Nancy
Whalen along with sophomore Carol
Dannelly and freshman Jodi Herring
finished with a time of 3:51.28 in the
400-meter freestyle relay against
Shepherd on Friday night in Cy
Twombly Pool. Sophomore Sharon
Coleman broke yet another school
record in the Gettysburg meet on Sat-
urday with a time of 4:59.10 in the
400-meter individual medley. The
final scores of both meets were very
close, with the Generals coming out
on the short end both times. W&L lost
to Shepherd 107-97 and hung tough
with Gettysburg before falling 99- 90.
These results were especially im-
pressive since W&L was by far the
underdog in both meets.

Remillard was pleased with his

team’s weekend performances. ‘*The
ladies really swam well. They are
responding every week with top per-
formances.”’

The virus which has struck the en-
tire W&L campus has hit the team
also, but Remillard said they are con-
tinuing to swim well.

‘*You never know how the virus
will affect us in the long run, but I'm
not overly worried. Right now aca-
demics are demanding, too, so the
effects of both health worries and
classroom responsibilities are evident
in the practices.”’

The women have a layoff of sorts as
their next meet is not for 10 days. The
Generals face Mary Washington in Cy

Twombly Pool on Feb. 11 and
Remillard is hoping for a double vic-
tory from the men and women.

Men sweep two;
raise record to 5-2

The W&L men’s team improved its
record to 5-2 with a pair of wins over
Shepherd (103-70) and Gettysburg
(93-87) on Friday and Saturday.

Freshman Brad Martin in the 500
free and senior Stu Sheldon in the 200
breaststroke turned in top perfor- °
mances.

‘*We swam some guys in off events,
and we still were able to get the same
results,"” said head coach Page
Remillard.

On Saturday the men will have a
stern test on the road against Division
I William and Mary at 2 pm.

Niccolo Paganini lived again for a
short time last week in Lee Chapel as
the Cleveland Quartet gave a wonder-
ful performance on his matched set of
four Stradivarius instruments.

In their Jan. 24 concert, the world-
famous quartet played three
pieces—Felix Mendelssohn’s Quartet
in D minor, Op. 44, No. 1; Quartet
No. 2 by the Modern-American com-
poser Christopher Rouse and
Beethoven’s Quartet in B-flat major,
Op. 130.

The quartet was brought to campus
by the Washington and Lee University
Concert Guild, whose members in-
clude Timothy Gaylard, assistant pro-
fessor of music, and several W&L
students.

According to the concert program,
the Cleveland Quartet is perhaps one
of the most accomplished performing
groups in classical music today. They
have recorded extensively, have been
honored with seven Grammy Award
nominations and were selected as
“‘Best of the Year’’ by Time and
Stereo Review Magazine. They were
also the first classical group to per-
form on the televised Grammy Award
Show.

The Cleveland Quartet has been
performing for twenty years and has
just completed its first tour of the

 

satirical songs, and this year she
offers several rare finds by Gershwin.
Stevens teaches at the College of
William and Mary.

Soviet Union. They performed in six
Soviet cities and at the American em-
bassy in Moscow at the request of the
American ambassador. The quartet
has also performed all across Europe
and the United States and several films
of its performances have been made.

The members of the quartet are
Donald Weilerstein, first violinist, a
Juilliard graduate; Peter Salaff, sec-
ond violinist, who taught violin in
Chile as a member of the Peace
Corps; James Dunham, violist, a
founding member of the Sequoia Str-
ing Quartet and Paul Ketz, cellist,
who is the current editor of; the
‘‘Chamber Music Forum,’’ a column
in American String Teacher Maga-
zine.

The quartet’s members are not only
dedicated musicians, but they are also
dedicated to the teaching of their craft.
All the members are professors at the
Eastman School of Music in
Rochester, N.Y.

The instruments played by the
quartet were made by the great crafts-
man Antonio Stradivari and were
owned and played by the legendary
virtuoso Niccolo Paganini. The in-
struments—two violins, a viola and a
cello—were sold individually after
Paganini’s death but were brought
back together and donated to the Cor-
coran Gallery of Art in Washington,
D.C., which loans them to the
Cleveland Quartet.

Capturing the office of Interfraternity Council Presi-
dent was current Phi Gamma Delta house president
Kevin Nash, who narrowly defeated David Gildea, a
member of Beta Theta Pi and a junior justice on the IFC
Judicial Board.

Nash’s campaign speech concerned the restoration of
some of the IFC autonomy and improved relations with
the university and the community.

Nash said, ‘“We can’t sit back and let the administra-
tion run all over us.”’

He also said his experience at the recently renovated
Fiji house will help the IFC and fraternities move into the
new ‘‘Fraternity Renaissance’’ era much easier, since
Fiji already has many of the things (such as a fully-
renovated structure and a house mother or ‘‘resident
manager’’, which Renaissance guidelines require) that
the other houses will soon see.

r

Nash said of the Renaissance program, ‘‘It’s a great
opportunity for every house on campus.”’

Candidates for vice-president were Pi Kappa Phi
member Hunt Niedringhaus, also a junior justice, and
IFC representative Warren Holland of Phi Delta Theta.

Niedringhaus defeated Holland on a campaign plat-
form dealing primarily with rush, which is the main
responsibility of the IFC vice-president.

He also said a successful Greek Week should be run by
the entire fraternal body, rather than rotating the respon-
sibility among various houses each year. He stressed the
importance of a thoroughly planned rush in order to elim-
inate last-minute problems.

Gordon DeKuyper of Beta Theta Pi defeated his three
opponents, Mike Skarda (Phi Kappa Psi), Karsten Amlie
(Sigma Chi) and Bill Tunner (Pi Kappa Alpha) for the of-
fice of IFC secretary without a run-off election. The new
IFC treasurer is Matt Murphy (Phi Kappa Psi), who was
chosen over Brooks Pettus (Phi Kappa Sigma) and Tom
Hatcher (Phi Delta Theta).

The senior justice position on the IFC Judicial Board
went to Scott T evitt (Phi Kappa Sigma), «ho heat Brad

Cannon (Pi Kappa Alpha). The two junior justice spots
went to Goodloe Lewis (Kappa Sigma) and Les Lewis
(Sigma Alpha Epsilon). The two defeated Mike Whorton
(Kappa Alpha), Allen Ferguson (Phi Kappa Sigma),
Jason Parker (Sigma Phi Epsilon) and John Phoenix (Phi
Delta Theta).

Associate Dean of Students Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins
said he was very pleased with the way this year’s elec-
tions went. He said all the candidates made good points
in their speeches and each house put forth its best can-
didates.

Issuing his congratulations to all of the new officers,
who will take office at the beginning of spring term, he
said the overall tone of the election was the best in the
three years he has served as Greek advisor.

Echoing the general sentiment of all the candidates,
IFC President Ross Singletary said he felt the new body
was ‘‘ready for a landmark year in relations with the uni-
versity.” s

He added, ‘‘This year’s board has been more active
and given me a lot of support in helping to voice the

‘Nash defeats Gildea for IFC President

students’ and fraternities’ opinions’ than those in the
past.

‘We've held the line this year,’’ Singletary said, ‘‘and
I hope that next year’s board can mark strides in regain-
ing general student autonomy”’ in an attempt to prevent
the university from ‘‘tightening the vise grip’’ on the
W&L Greek system.

Singletary said some major issues that next year’s IFC
will have to face are liability, continued progress in
community relations and philanthropic projects, a further
strengthening of fraternity-police relations and the
upholding of a ‘better attitude toward hazing’’ that the
IFC has helped establish within the fraternities this year.

Overall, Singletary said he was very pleased with this
year’s progress and is confident of the new officers and
the IFC’s future.

At least four of the newly-elected officers will travel to
Atlanta for the Feb. 16-19 Southeastern Interfraternity
Conference, where they will begin to face the important
issues they must deal with beginning in spring term and
continuing into the 1989-90 school year.

Vandals

 

By Pat Lopes
Staff Reporter

Lexington police have connected
local juveniles to the shoplifting of
more than 100 music tapes from the
W&L Bookstore last summer and the
disappearance of personal belongings
from carrels in the undergraduate
library last fall, but have no leads yet
in the January incident of vandalism
and theft on campus and in town.

A group of juveniles confessed in
November and December to stealing
the tapes and personal belongings, ac-
cording to Lexington Police Sgt.
Torben Pedersen. One juvenile has
been convicted of larceny and will pay
restitution for the tapes. Trial of two
other juveniles is currently being con-
sidered.

Efforts to recover the stolen proper-
ty have been hampered by a network
of recipients, Pedersen said. Stolen
property was passed from the person
who stole the items to friends, who in
turn passed the items to other people.

A camera, three calculators and a
backpack have been recovered. Lost
property reports completed by
students are being matched with prop-
erty recovered from the juveniles.
One calculator has been returned to a
WA&L student.

In an unrelated case, a wave of van-
dalism and thefts that washed over
W&L and Lexington between Jan. 7
and 8 is also being investigated by
Lexington police. Police Chief Bruce
Beard said that because similar van-
dalism has not occurred since that
weekend, the vandals probably were
passing through Lexington and are not
local residents.

White Book
iS an issue
for the EC

By Genienne Mongno
Staff Reporter

 

 

 

 

The Executive Committee discus-
sed several proposed amendments to
the White Book Monday night that
address the procedure for selecting
the chairperson of a student body
hearing.

Currently, the White Book says the
president of the Student Bar Associa-
tion (SBA) serves as the chairperson
for a student body hearing. However,
since the SBA president is elected by
law students and not the entire student
body, several EC members asked last
week if the selection process should
be changed.

The third-year Law representative,
Dave Nave, said he believed the
chairperson should continue to be the
SBA president. But, he suggested a
clause be written into the White Book
that states if problems arise with the
chairperson, he or she can be

The initials VES and DSR were
scrawled in various locations on the

the initials of Virginia Episcopal
School, but police have no proof of a

The proposed revisions, which

DuPre and second-year law student
John Falk, change the wording of
several sentences in Section one of
the White Book under ‘‘Procedure for
a Student Body Hearing.’

The revisions make it clear that
both the EC and the accused party
have the right to question the compe-
tency of the chair, but both parties
must approve before the chair can be
substituted, according to Falk.

The revisions also state that the re-
placement for the chair will be
someone chosen from the SBA Board
of Governors whom both parties find
mutually acceptable. But, no member
of the SBA Board of Governors will

Correction

Last week’s Phi stated that next year’s tuition
would increase by 2 percent. It should have said 13
percent. The Phi regrets this error.

 

In addition, Murray said, two
separate envelopes, containing $140
and $50 in cash, were taken from the
desk of secretary Lois Dickerson in
Tucker Hall. The letters VES and
DSR were written in chalk on
blackboards in Tucker, and were also
etched in the office door of Charles
Boggs on the third floor of Newcomb
Hall. Fire extinguishers were set off
in Newcomb and Robinson halls.

Other buildings targeted included
the library, where the copy machine
on the second lower level was pried
open, and the Military Science
building, where the thieves took Sgt.

liner, two fire extinguishers and two
university phones.

In town, the vandals left their mark
in black paint inside the post office
and outside Wadell School and the
building where the Subway was
formerly located. According to Beard,
local residents are not alarmed by the
vandal’s work.

**T think if it was an everyday thing
people would be concerned,’’ said
Chief Beard.

But the arrest of the juveniles and
the widespread mischief of the vandals
should concern the W&L community,
according to Beard. Students take ad-
vantage of the atmosphere of. trust
made possible by the honor system,

leaving valuables unsecured on cam-
pus.
‘*The whole school is set up for the
honor system, which is fine as long as
only students utilize the facilities,’’
said Pedersen. Unfortunately, people
outside of the university community
also take advantage of the atmosphere
of trust, with dishonorable intentions.

Murray also expressed particular
concern about the computer labs on
campus and the amount of equipment
left in them overnight.

Pedersen said he suggested that the

" Bookstore install a convex security

mirror. A convex mirror would
enable bookstore personnel to watch
blind spots created by a large number
of bookcases crowded into a small
area. However, students may feel
their honor is being questioned by a
mirror, pointed out Bookstore
Manager Tidge Roller.

“I would be reluctant to change
what I feel was a great atmosphere in
here. It’s a sticky situation. If the
students wouldn’t feel it’s a slam at
them, I would love to be able to do
it,’’ Roller said.

“*T would love to know how the EC
would feel,’’ she continued.

With this in mind, Pedersen rec-
ommends that ‘‘all the students be less
trusting, that they take greater care at
securing their property’’ on the cam-
pus as well as in cars, houses, fraterni-
ty houses and apartments.

Pedersen also recommends that
students note strangers on campus
who do not part appear to be part of
the university community.

‘*What we would like to have is the
students to be on the lookout for out of
place people so that we have
something to work on, some suspects
to look out for,’’ Pedersen said.

Phi Beta
Kappa list
is updated

From Staff Reports

 

Thirty-four Washington and Lee
University undergraduates and two
1988 graduates of W&L have been
elected into membership in W&L’s
Gamma of Virginia chapter of Phi
Beta Kappa. In addition to the student
initiates, the W&L chapter has elected
three honorary members.

The new members will be formally
initiated into the national fraternity on
March 15 when the W&L chapter
holds its annual Phi Beta Kappa con-
vocation.

The three honorary initiates are
John W. Elrod, vice president of aca-
demic affairs, dean of the College and
professor of philosophy at W&L;
William Hurt Sledge, a 1967 W&L
graduate and professor of philosophy
at the Yale School of Medicine; and
Hans C. von Baeyer, professor of
physics at The College of William and
Mary. von Baeyer will be the prin-
cipal speaker for the convocation.

Phi Beta Kappa was installed at
Washington and Lee in 1911 and an-
nually elects a limited number of
students of outstanding character and
superior academic records.

The students elected to membership
in Phi Beta Kappa are:

In searching for a name, Hull knew he couldn’t
call the restaraunt Subway because of the national
chain of Subway sandwich shops.

Hull got the name and motif idea, Down Under,
after traveling to Australia last year with a troup of
Lexington Boy Scouts, They attended the World

Jamboree with groups comparable to Boy Scouts
from 135 countries.

Hull and Edwards have done extensive clean-

themselves. They have made numerous wood cuts
of the Australian continent, kangaroos and koala

bears to decorate the walls.

Down Under will feature subs and sandwiches,
as well as soft drinks and beer, for lunch and din-

also have table service rather than self-service.
Hull also plans to have a wide-screen television, a

Low turnout at IFC’s $450 date rape seminar

By Nick Thompson
Staff Reporter

 

Assoc. Dean of Students Anne C,
Schroer-Lamont said she was dis-
appointed at the number of admin-
istrators and fraternity members who
attended a televised conference on
acquaintance/date rape shown in Nor-
then Auditorium last Thursday after-
noon.

About 50 people came to the three-
hour seminar which was sponsored by
the Washington and Lee Interfraterni-
ty Council for $450.

Schroer-Lamont said 35 women
from W&L and the surrounding
womens’ colleges have reported inci-
dents of acquaintance rape since the

fall of 1985. In the past year, 12 of the
137 women at the law school have
experienced acquaintance rape,
Schroer-Lamont said.

According to Dr. Claire Walsh, di-
rector of the Sexual Assault Recovery
Service at the University of Florida,
‘One out of three women will be a
victim of rape and there is a 100 per-
cent chance that every man will en-
counter acquaintance rape, meaning
that someone he cares about will be
raped.”’

The program began with four pos-
sible date 1 pe situations followed by
a discussion of the audience’s re-
sponse to the question, ‘‘Did a rape
occur?’’

According to Dr. Barry Burkhart,
professor of psychology at Aubum

University, ‘‘{If somebody is har-
med], then a rape has been commit-
ted.’’ Burkhart said although this
criteria for defining rape ‘‘extends the
law a bit,’’ it helps clarify what is
considered ‘‘not good conduct.”’

He said the reality of acquaintance
rape must be realized by students and
administrators before the problem can
be controlled.

W&L freshmen and their dorm
counselors will be required to attend
an acquaintance rape program during
the week of Feb. 20. Schroer-Lamont
said she expects 12 to 20 girls will
come forward as acquaintance rape
victims following the freshman pro-
gram.

Most of the panelists stressed
several important points during the

teleconference such as:

*It is not the woman’s fault that she
was raped, Many women never report
acquaintance rape or seek counseling
because they believe that they caused
it to happen.

*Go to an emergency room or a

rape crisis Clinic for immediate medi-
cal attention. Rape victims are usually
not protected against venereal
diseases or pregnancy because con-
doms are rarely used in a acquain-
tance rape situation.

*Don’t take a shower before getting
a medical examination. This will ena-
ble doctors to provide the police with
medical evidence of a rape if a
woman decides to take her case to
court.
 

 

 

OPINION

Problems for
the Phi staff

Want a copy of the Phi? Well, if you answered yes to
that question, you had better be in the University Center
at 5 p.m. each Thursday to be sure you get one.

They seem to be a pretty hot item. I mean, they are
free. And, hell, you can probably fit 15-20 in your back-
pack. You could decorate the inside of your trash can
with the leftovers after you’ve read one. Wait, send some
pledges to take a bundle of 150 so everyone in the frater-
nity house can choose exactly which copy he would like
to read.

Maybe your goal is to be the only member of the W&L
community to be able to get a copy of the Phi.

Or, rather than having to walk to the library or the Uni-
versity Center, you could simply snag one out of some
professor’s mailbox before class, then the professor could
blame it on the Phi Circulation Manager for not getting a
paper.

If you haven’t guessed yet, there is a circulation prob-
lem because people are taking too many newspapers. This
problem is not a new one, by any means. It has been ad-
dressed by many Phi staffs prior to this one. Unfortun-
ately, it is our subscribers (who paid $25 to have each is-
sue mailed to them) who have suffered and continue to
suffer.

When several people take four or five papers, and each
person only reads one, then (for you economics buffs) the
supply goes down while the demand remains the same.
The question arises - What can be done? Since the papers
are free, we cannot increase the price to meet the demand.
We must resort to other means. For one, we are increasing
the number of issues delivered each week. The increase in
the number of issues we receive will not help if you in-
crease the number of issues you take each week to add to
your circular file (trash can).

We are asking that you take only as many issues as you
plan on reading, and try to restrain from snagging any
from a professor’s mailbox.

Thank you, and Merry Washington Holiday!

Likely presidents and their policies

 

MY VIEW
By Jon Sbar

 

It seems like just yesterday George
Bush and Michael Dukakis were in a
neck and neck battle for the privilege
of carving their initials into White
House furniture and picking up dates
in a presidential limousine with bullet
proof windows and a stocked bar. Of
course, Dukakis’s election bid was
ruined after Senator Joe McCarthy III
revealed records proving that Dukakis
checked out the Comminist Manifesto
from the Boston Public Library in the
eighth-grade—a sure sign of commu-
nist tendencies.

Like most people with too much

free time on their hands I’ve spent a!
lot of time imagining what it would be
like if someone besides Bush had been
elected. But unlike most people with a
lot of free time on their hands, not
only do I think about these things, I
write about them. Here is my
reconstruction of ideas and policies of
some likely presidential candidates.

President Bob Marley (famous
reggae singer) and his political goals:

1) Legalize marijuana;

2) Turn the White House into a
Rastafarian temple;

3) Make ‘‘Buffalo Soldier’’ the new
National Anthem,

4) Eliminate the government,

’ 5) Bring family to America.

President Mike Tyson and _ his
comments after punching out Gor-
bachev in the first round of the summit
talks: ‘‘I don’t take s--t from some

four eyed feather weight with a mole
on his bald head.’’

President Homer (famous blind poet
from ancient Greece) at his inaugura-
tion: ‘Now that I’m elected I promise
there won’t be another Trojan War.
Read my lips: No Trojan War.’’

President Larry Flint (Editor of
Hustler Magazine) on the subject of
education: ‘‘Let’s take pornography to
the schools. It belongs there because
students will pay attention to their
teachers if they find the subject matter
stimulating and friends, Algebra just
don’t cut it.””

President June Cleaver (Leave it to
Beaver) commenting on an unfriendly
senator: “Senator Barnyard reminds
me of Eddie’ Haskell. Why I re-
member once Eddie stole the Beaver’s
best marble and blamed it on Wally.”’

(Miami drug dealer) on international

commerce: ‘‘We must stop govern- ,

‘ment interference in the free market.
All international trading should be |
deregulated.”’

Presidents Moe, Larry, and Curly
(the Three Stooges) after starting a pie
fight at the Yugoslavian embassy: No
comment

President David Letterman and his »

budget goals: ‘‘Let’s take all of the
country’s tax money and spend it on
designing new and improved ‘Stupid
Pet Tricks,’ °’

Key athletes oppose requirements

Due to an Editorial Page space problem last
week, all but one of the names signed to this letter
were omitted. We have decided to reprint the
letter with the signatures. We apologize.

An Open Letter to the Washington and Lee Com-
munity:

Washington and Lee University prides itself on
the great amount of self-government that its
students are given. In light of this fact, it is impor-
tant that the University community be informed of
a proposed change in the physical education grad-
uation requirement.

As part of a campus-wide self-study, a five per-
son committee consisting of Athletic Department
personnel decided that the physical education re-
quirement, specifically in reference to inter-
collegiate athletes, should be changed. They felt
that a new policy could better reflect the diverse,
liberal arts focus of the University.

In order to ‘‘allow’’ a more diverse exposure to
the world of physical fitness and recreation, the
committee suggests that the maximum fraction of
a credit hour allowed for each varsity sport a stu-
dent participates in would be reduced from two-
fifths to one-fifth. This change would mean that
two, three, or even four years of varsity participa-

tion would garner the W&L student- athlete a-

paltry 1/5th credit, leaving four more P.E. classes
needed for graduation.

This move, at a school that has a long and rich
athletic tradition, as well as a 25% rate of inter-
collegiate athletic participation among its current
student body, would be a travesty. This proposed
policy change not only greatly limits the student-
athlete in his choice of when not to enroll in non-
varsity P.E. classes, it also fails to recognize the
diverse gains made from intercollegiate-level
training and competition.

The student-athlete at W&L is the student who
is internally motivated to participate in athletics.
He or she is the person who will be involved in

physical activity for the rest of their life. These
young adults have established, through years of
dedication and self-motivation, the desire to stay
physically fit, and to participate in a wide spec-
trum of invigorating activities.

These student-athletes, who spend many hours
each week involved in a variety of physical ac-
tivities, do not need to be ‘‘allowed’’ to explore
the variety of the school’s offerings. The liberal
arts emphasis of W&L is embodied in the student-
athlete. The Athletic Department’s goal of a stu-
dent body that is well-versed in motor skills and

‘fitness, rules and strategy, and good sportsman-

ship, has already been ingrained in the student-
athlete.

We, the undersigned student-athletes, as well as
other members of the W&L community, support
an alternative solution that would serve not only
the student-athlete, but also benefit the general
student, and the Athletic Department itself:

1) Allow 1/Sth a credit for the first season of
each varsity sport in which the student-athlete par-
ticipates. (Each student would still need to accu-
mulate 5/Sths cr. hr.)

2) For each subsequent season, in each sport,
give the student-athlete one credit hour of graded
participation, up to a total of nine credits. (8 cr.
hrs. + 5/Scr. hr. = 9 cr. hrs.)

The W&L student participates in intercollegiate
athletics for many reasons, primarily because they
want to. The beneficial growing experiences that
the student-athlete receives adds a whole new
dimension to his or her education. The positive
exposure the University receives through their
success is as valuable to W&L as the research,
writing, and performances done in other areas.

If the University feels so strongly that physical
education is important to a liberal arts education
that it makes frequent participation a requirement,
then the University should accord the Department
of Athletics equal status with the rest of the cam-
pus.

It is time that the student-athlete, as well as the

Athletic Department’s physical education offer-
ings, be given the credits they deserve. The Uni-
versity should assemble a group, comprised ot
students, student-athletes, and faculty members,
to discuss this proposal. More importantly the
administration should pay attention to what the
students, and the University community, feel is
best for the future of Washington & Lee!

Stuart Sheldon

W&L aids recyclers

 

By Lori Richardson
Staff Reporter

 

The Rockbridge Area Recycling Coalition behind Peebles department store
hopes to expand its new recycling facility in Lexington with help from the

Washington and Lee community.

The Buildings and Grounds staff at W&L is boosting the recycling effort by
collecting recyclable garbage from the campus, said B&G Superintendent

James Arthur.

‘“We’re going to park a vehicle behind Reid Hall one day a week to collect
and separate cardboard, newspapers and general paper to take to the center,”’
he said. Arthur said plans for a cooperative effort were finalized last week.

According to Marilyn Maisano of the recycling coalition, the W&L adminis-

tration has committed'to recycling efforts, too.

‘‘We want the offices at W&L to bring us their paper. The Buildings and
Grounds truck will-be on campus Tuesdays. The sheer velocity of the throw-

away paper at W&L could help us a lot.

‘“We have separate dumpsters at the facility marked for high-grade com-
puter paper, mixed office paper, cardboard and junk mail, tin and aluminum.”’

A paid attendant, Margaret Carol, supervises the center during the operating
hours of 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, Maisano
said. She also said several inmates from local jails work off their community
service hours by helping citizens unload their recyclables at the center, which

has been open for two months.

The current Rockbridge Area Recycling Coalition resulted when a group
from the League of Women Voters became angered by the illegal dumping of
pollutants in local water bodies, said Maisano.

She said, ‘‘We did not protest, but found an alternative instead.

‘“We felt the turn-out at the meeting showed the community was really be-

hind us.”’

The coalition raised money through grants from the city and county. Ma-
isano said the city donated about $2,000 and the county donated $7,000.

According to Maisano, the coalition leaders plan to meet with the city coun-
cil soon to plan a grand opening of the recycling center.

She said the coalition hopes to expand the number of recyclables they can
collect. If all goes well, the facility can extend its operating time to seven days

a week.

According to Arthur, the goal of the recycling program is to operate indefi-
nitely. He said the organizers hope Rockbridge County will take it over and

make it a permanent facility.

Cadets in top 15%

 

By Hughes Melton
Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee’s ROTC
cadets have been recognized by the
region commander for performing in
the top 15 percent of the schools in
their region last summer.

A letter from Brig. Gen. Wallace C.
Arnold to President Wilson cited the
department’s ‘‘overall caliber’’ and
the ‘‘high level of motivation’’ within
the unit.

Wilson said, ‘‘This ability to lead
other people will carry over into other
professions.”’

Five of the 15 seniors who set high
marks this summer will use these abil-
ities in civilian professions after short
training stints on active and reserve
duty in the Army.

Performance at summer camp in
Fort Bragg, N.C., between the junior
and senior years is a large factor in re-
ceiving the type duty requested (active
or reserve).

‘In my four years here, no group of
students has performed at this level of
excellence,’ said Dean of the College

John W. Elrod.

“This recognition is just one in-
dicator of the quality of the pro-
gram,’’ said Lt. Col. Joel J. Snow,
professor of Military Science.

“It reflects the excellent training
and commitment by the cadets and fa-
culty of the Mink Battalion to achiev-
ing the standard expressed by the
Cadet Command motto—‘Leadership
and Excellence.’ *’

Each year, the ROTC training pro-
gram is evaluated and this year W&L
received the highest rating among the
18 East Coast schools in its brigade.
In the regional competition with Ivy
League schools, only Princeton
received a higher rating.

‘This is an indication of the conti-
nuing quality of the program,”’ said
Snow, ‘‘characterized by exciting,
challenging and vigorous training. We
continue to share the university's ‘no-
nonsense’ commitment to teaching
and developing our students, main-
taining a learning environment em-
phasizing personal honor and integrity
and instilling in our cadets a sense of
responsibility to serve our nation.”’

W&L gets $600,000 geology grant

From Staff Reports

 

Washington and Lee University is
among 12 liberal arts colleges chosen
to participate in the W.M. Keck
Foundation Faculty/Student Geology
Consortium. The W.M. Keck Foun-
dation of Los Angeles, Calif., re-
cently awarded a grant of $600,000 to
support the continuation and expan-
sion of the program over the next two
years.

In addition to W&L, participating
institutions are Ambherst College,
Beloit College, Carleton College,
Colorado College, Franklin and Mar-
shall College, Pomona College, Smith
College, Trinity University, Whitman
College, Williams College and the
College of Wooster.

The grant is designed to support
geological research of undergraduate
students and faculty and to bring
together geology students and faculty
from a number of institutions to share
their common interests.

Edgar W. Spencer, chairman of the
geology” department at W&L,

describes the exchange of ideas as ‘‘a
cross-fertilization project for schools
like W&L.”’

The W.M. Keck Foundation Con-
sortium Grant will support five
different projects during the summers
of 1989 and 1990. Each project will
run about six weeks and will be jointly
directed by faculty members trom
several of the participating schools.
Students from all 12 colleges will be
eligible to participate as field resear-
chers on the projects and will com-
plete their research when they return
to their respective campuses. In the
spring, the students and faculty will
get together for a meeting to present
papers and discuss their research pro-
jects.

The geology projects to be studied
in the summer of 1989 include the
ecology of recent and ancient shores
in Gaspe, Canada; the study of a fault
zone in Minnesota; ancient reefs in
Spain; earthquake seismology in
Texas and metamorphism in Chester
Dome in Vermont. .

In the summer of 1990, Spencer

will direct a project on the structural
geology of the Blue Ridge Mountains.

The W.M. Keck Foundation, one of
the nation’s largest foundations in
terms of annual grants, was estab-
lished in 1954 by the late William M.
Keck, founder of the Superior Oil
Company, who also created in his will
the W.M. Keck Trust for the benefit
of the foundation.

The foundation’s primary focus is
on grants to universities and colleges
throughout the United States, with
particular emphasis in the fields of
earth sciences, engineering and medi-
cal research. It also provides limited
support, focused on program serving
Southern California, in the areas of
community services, health care,
precollegiate education and the arts.

Hoops finishes 14-0 in the ‘Temple’

 

By Jay Plotkin
Staff Reporter

 

It has been a long month for the
Washington and Lee basketball team.
But last week the team began to reap '
the rewards of its hard work.

Last Thursday the Generals enter-
tained Emory & Henry, a matchup of
the top two teams in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference. The last time the
teams met, the Generals prevailed 62-
57. With a win this time, W&L could
clinch at least a tie for the regular
season title, and with the game being
played in the Warner Center, things
definitely looked good for the Gen-
erals.

Things looked even better when the
game got underway. Sophomore
center Chris Jacobs scored the first
four points of the game, and before
the Wasps could turn around, they
were being stung 27-6; their top
scorer and rebounder, Major Warner,
was in foul trouble; and the Generals
were on fire. When sophomore guard
Pat Gallavan hit for three with 11:24,
the lead was 21. When he hit again
from trey-land two minutes later, the
lead was 24, 33-9.

E&H started on the comeback trail
and closed the gap to 44- 26 at the half

 

 

 

 

Verne Canfield

and kept coming back. Mike Posey
converted a three-point play with

14:54 left, making the score was 49-
37 W&L. When Mark Cornette hit
from 19 feet for the Wasps, the W&L
lead was one at 71-70 with 3:05 left.
But the Generals held on and went on
a 10-2 run to open up an 81-72 lead.
Leon Hill’s three pointer provided the
final margin, 81-75.

Hill finished with 29 points to top
all scorers. Posey was the only other
Wasp in double digits with 13. The
Generals were led by their splendid
sophomores. Guard Mike Holton led
the way with 16, Jacobs added 15, Ed
Hart 14 and Gallavan 10.

On Saturday the Generals played
host to the team that earlier handed
them their worst loss of the season,
Emory University.

“Gallavan, who started for the first
time this season, scored the Generals
first 10 points in the opening 4:30.
Emory, however, grabbed a 16-10
lead before Hart made his presence
felt. The sophomore scored five
straight points, and Holton’s three-
pointer gave the Generals an 18-17
advantage. When sophomore Scott
Alrutz and Jacobs combined for 10 of
the Generals next 13 points, the lead
was 31-21 with 9:37 remaining.

Emory cut the lead to one at the

half, 49-48, behind the play of David
Gaynes and Paul Damm, who had 13
and 10 points respectively in the half.
Jacobs scored 14 of his 18 in the first
half for W&L.

To start the second half, the Eagles
opened up a four point lead on a
basket by Gaynes at the 16-minute
mark, but the Generals pulled even at
61 on a basket by yet another sopho-
more, Craig Hatfield. The Eagles then
eased to a 71-65 lead before Holton
went to work for W&L.

A three-pointer cut the lead in half,
71-68, and another bomb made it a
one point game at 76-75. When Hart
tipped in a miss with 6:06 left, the
Generals led for good at 79-78.
Holton’s third three-pointer in six
minutes made it 84-78, and the Gen-
erals held on for a 99-95 win.

“*T can’t say enough about our fans.
They made the difference tonight. I
felt like running out to half court and [
shaking my fists to entice the crowd],
but I didn’t want to get a technical
foul. They were fantastic. I feel like
buying them about four kegs.”’

On Tuesday night the Generals
closed out their 1988-89 home season
against Averett College.

W&L jumped out to a quick 20-11
lead when Holton nailed a three-
pointer with 11:15 left in the first half.

Then Winchester went to work for the
Cougars. He scored five of their next
eight points to bring Averett within
three. James Braxton scored to give
Averett the lead, and when Tony Seay
scored with 7:13 left, the Cougar lead
was 27-22. Averett led at the half 37-
34 behind 13 points from Kennard
Winchester and 10 from Seay.

Hatfield then put W&L on his
shoulders and carried them the rest of
the way, scoring 21 points in the sec-
ond half. When he hit two more free
throws with 8:08 left, the lead was 11
at 65- 54. Averett cut the lead to three
at 72-69 on Glen Oliver's three
pointer, but the Generals put out
Averett’s fire with a basket by Jacobs
and five more Hatfield points to ex-
tend the lead back to 10 with just over
two minutes left, and the Generals
held on to win 84-79.

The win gave the Generals their
first undefeated home season, with a
14-0 record. The win also gave Can-

Canfield notches 400th career coaching victory; looks forward to 500

 

By Jay Plotkin
Staff Reporter

 

For 25 years, Verne Canfield
has been the head coach here at
Washington and Lee. On Tuesday
night, when his Generals defeated
Averett College 84-79, he joined
the ranks of the Division III elite
with his 400th coaching victory.

“It’s a tribute to all the young
men that I have had that have add-
ed to that 400,’’ said Canfield.
‘Not only players, but you’ve got
assistant coaches and support peo-
ple. In our program right now, the
secretary and the guy who cleans
our locker room and wipes the
floor are just as important to us.
It’s nice to achieve it, and obvious-

ly it’s not something you do by
yourself.
““We’re
The road to 400 was not at all
easy for Canfield. He inherited a
program in 1964 that had suffered
through seven straight losing
seasons. After losing his first
twelve ball games, he quickly
turned the program around, and in
his third season, the team went
20-5 and won the College Athletic
Conference championship.
Canfield says the first two wins
he ever had at W&L were certainly
memorable. ‘‘I can tell you my
first win here. It was against North
Carolina Wesleyan, and it was the
year we only won two, so it was
easy to remember. The second win

looking forward to

was against Old Dominion.”’

The month of February has pro-
ved to be kind to Canfield. He has
achieved three of his milestones
during this month. On February
18, 1971, in his seventh year at
W&L, he got his 100th victory,
84-77 over Dickinson College in
the old Doremus Gym. On Febru-
ary 16, 1977 came win number
200, a 101-94 win over North
Carolina-Greensboro. That win
gave his team a 20-2 record, the
best in W&L history. The team fin-
ished 23-5, ranked No. 4 in Divi-
sion III. On January 8, 1983, a vic-
tory over Lebanon Valley earned
him his 300th win. That team fin-
ished 17-10.

“Tf the good Lord is willing, and
I mean this very much so, because

He is the one I put my faith in, I
want to coach 15 more years. I
want to coach until I’m 70, if I’m
physically able to do it and mental-
Ty able to do it, and I see no reason
why I can’t, I want to do it until
I’m 70. If not here, then someplace
else, because that’s my calling in
life. I was called to be a coach, and
I’m not sure what else I'd do if I
wasn’t a coach.

“I always tell the guys that I’m
going to teach them more than
basketball. Maybe I can teach them
something about themselves, and
that’s what important. Not winning
and losing.”’

On Tuesday, Canfield received
what he felt was one of the greatest
honors since he has been in
coaching. ‘‘[Tuesday]night, I had

the honor of hearing the students
chant my name. I can’t even ex-
press how that makes you feel.’’

Canfield joins a list of 11
coaches who have reached the 400-
win plateau. There is only one
Division III coach who has reached
the 500-win mark, and Canfield
would love to reach that mark as
well.

‘*We’re looking forward to 500,
and the good Lord willing, we’ll
achieve that some day. I would like
to achieve the 500, at least.”’

To Canfield, there is more to
coaching than just winning and los-
ing. ‘‘I remember—as I want the
players to remember—the good
times you had. The trying times
you had an how you pulled
together.”’

fin! W&L SNACK

Our common sense tells us we can’t do certain things. Common sense
says not to leave dirty dishes in the sink for three months. Common
sense warns us not to mess with people built like Arnold
Schwarzenegger. Commons sense also informs us it is not wise to have
Sports Illustrated’s swimsuit issue on the coffee table when the
girlfriend comes over. Safer to have something like Newsweek.

For Averett head coach Ed Hall, common sense was something he
forgot to pack in his travel bag on Tuesday night. Hall, whose team lost
84-79 to the Generals in the Warner Center, was not pleased with the of-
ficiating, especially considering W&L out- shot Averett 31-7 from the
free throw line. But Hall did not resort to your usual bickering and com-
plaining about the refs. No, Mr. Hall took it one step further.

With less than one minute remaining, the Cougars trailed by as many
as eight points. Feeling the game was over, Hall stopped doing what he
gets paid to do—namely, coach his team—and instead turned the final
60-odd seconds into something you see during an eighth-grader’s
recess.

‘*F--- you,”’ said Hall to the officials as the they ran past him. ‘‘You
‘ really screwed us you a--h---.’’ What was that you said? Do you mind
speaking up, Mr. Hall? I don’t think the small children in the tenth row
heard you. ‘‘You f---ing suck,’’ retorted the ‘adult’ (I use this term
loosely, here, like Hall’s tongue) who is supposed to be representing his
college.

The officials, thankfully, abhorred from slapping Hall with a
technical (I wish someone had slapped him, literally) so as to bring the
game to a speedy conclusion. But does that mean its okay for Hall to just
let his mouth run amok and personally insult the men in the striped
shirts? What does common sense say?

Hall continually asked for ‘‘fairness’’ from the refs during the
ballgame. Was what Hall said fair? Hall rated their efforts as ‘‘high-
school’’ officiating. I submit that you, Mr. Hall, didn’t even deserve
that level of competence. Your actions were more like kindergart-
ners’—name calling and finger-pointing.

You hear coaches talking about winning and losing graciously,
sportsmanship and class. I guess ‘‘class’’ is not in Hall’s vocabulary
considering most of the words he uses contain only four letters. Hall
forgot why he came to Lexington in the first place—to coach his team in
a basketball game. Coaches ask their players to play a ‘‘full’’ 40
minutes, but Hall forgot this philosophy, coaching instead for only 39
minutes and using the remainder to berate, accost and vent his frustra-
tions on three men who have one of the most thankless jobs in all of
sports.

On what should have been night of happiness and celebration for
W&L’s Verne Canfield and his 400th career win, Hall left a bad taste in
the mouths of the people who had witnessed his tirade. He also had me
asking, ‘‘Does this man have any common sense?”’

Working Girl is a big COpy Wa Weekly Calendar

 

 

 

Melanie Griffith is sweet and sexy

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

There is little question that this
year’s Oscar race is going to be one of
the most contested in recent years.
One could argue that the close com-
petition has emerged because there
aren't any films, like last years big
winner The Last Emperor, that sat
head and shoulders above the rest. On
the contrary, this year’s race has
emerged because a plethora of films
have risen to the plateau of excellence
that the Academy demands.

Rain Man, Mississippi Burning, The
Accused, Who Framed Roger Rabbit ?,
Big and Gorillas in the Mist will all be
around when the Oscar nominations
come out later this month. They are all
excellent, and all have legitimate shots
at winning. But, when you are tallying
your winners, don’t overlook the
year’s surprise comedy hit Working
Girl. It could be this year’s biggest
sleeper.

Mike Nichol’s hit comedy starring
Melanie Griffith, Harrison Ford and
Sigourney Weaver is giving Big and
Roger Rabbit some serious competi-
tion as the best comedy of the year. In
fact, it beat out both films as the year’s
best comedy at the Foreign Press
Association’s Golden Globe Awards
two weeks ago. In addition, Griffith
took home the award for Best Actress
in a Comedy (the Golden Globes name
Best Films in both comedy/musical
and drama categories as opposed to
the Academy Awards that simply
names the Best Film taking all films
into account for the one category).

Working Girl centers around work-

ing girl/corporate goddess wanna-be
Tess McGill (Griffith) who goes to
work for boss Katharine Baker
(Weaver) in the mergers and acquisi-
tions section of a New York corpora-
tion. When Katharine breaks her leg
on a ski trip, Tess has to cover for her
at the office and finds that her boss has
made plans to use an idea for a merger
that she suggested.

Needless to say Tess is more than a
little miffed at the ethically reprehen-
sible actions of her boss and sets out to
right herself regardless of the cost.
After all, as she says to Harrison Ford
in one scene, ‘‘I have the mind for
business and a body for sin.”’

Throw in love interest Jack
Trainer (Ford) and you basically have
enough material to get to the end of
the two hour screenplay.

I really do not mean to sound flip-
pant. Working Girl is an enjoyable
film that I am happy I went to see. I
must admit, however, that throughout
the entire film something about it
bothered me until I finally realized
what it was. The film is basically a
wolf in sheep’s clothing.

Anyone remember a film that came
out a couple of years ago with Michael
J. Fox and Helen Slater about a kid
from nowhere, who through a little
undercover razza-ma-tazz works his
way up to the upper echelon of his
uncle’s New York corporation? Any
bells ringing in anyone’s head? How
about the title? The Secret of My
Success maybe. Boing! Yeah, now
everyone is getting the little light bulb.

If you think about it and do a little
comparing, it is easy to see that Work-
ing Girl is the exact same film to the
letter as The Secret of My Success:ex-

The Ring-tum Phi, February 9, 1989

 

 

Girl.”’

cept the roles are reversed by sex and
the cast of Working Girl is bigger in
terms of actor’s reputations. I don’t
want to ruin Working Girl for anyone
who: hasn’t seen it yet by making too
many comparisons but keep basic
plot, the resolution of the plot and
specific characters in mind when you
see Working Girl and see if it’s not the
same film.

As I said though, I’m still glad that I
saw the film. It is done very well and
is very amusing and entertaining.
Melanie Griffith, though a little
heavy, continues to be the sultry, sexy

 

Harrison Ford, Melanie Griffith and Sigourney Weaver star in ‘*Working

 

siren that she was in Body Double and
Something Wild. 1 guess it runs in the
family (Tippi Hedren of Hitchcock
fame is Griffith's mother). Ford is
cool and dashing as usual and Weaver
is fine as the woman we all want to
hate.

Working Girl is cute and it’s fun.
It’s not better or funnier than Big, but
it more than justifies its ticket price.
The cinematography around New
York is especially dashing. Take some
time to see it.

Entertainment Editor

 

Ladies and gentlemen of Wash-
ington and Lee, welcome to An
Evening Excursion on the Orient
Express; the 82nd annual Fancy
Dress Ball.

Since the origin of our little get-
together in 1907, Fancy Dress has
grown into what the New York
Times once called ‘‘the biggest col-
legiate social event in the South.”’
Naturally we like to believe it still
is, and looking at this year’s Ball
especially, we can easily support
the claim.

Fancy Dress will officially kick
off Thursday night around 8 p.m.,
when the Fabulous Waller Family
opens for the undisputed king of
the blues, B.B. King in what pro-
ves to be the best concert we have

 

NY alumni sponsor

seen at the pavilion in tour years.
Known for many years as the con-
summate entertainer, B.B. King
will surely excite and please those
who come to hear him play Thurs-

day night.

Then, on to Friday night, the big
night, the night of the Fancy Dress
Ball itself. The night that people
get lost in their anticipation, their
expectations and the realization of
their hopes, dreams and fantasies.

As you and your date approach
Fancy Dress 1989, two enormous
search lights will criss-cross the
skies over the Warner Center while
lighted lampposts lead the way to
your excursion on the Orient Ex-
press. A_ red-carpeted staircase
flanked by trees with miniature
white lights will lead to the en-
trance of the Warner Center where

career day in the city

* By David Emrich

Staff Reporter

 

For two days last week, the Career
Development and Placement Office

* became a travel agency that offered

students the chance to spend at least
part of their Washington Break in
New York City. The students who
took advantage of the offer were not,
however, in the city to relax and take
in the sights. Rather, they were there
to meet with alumni and learn
something about career opportunities
in New York City.

According to Director of Career
Services N. Rick Heatley, 42 students
(including 11 who aren’t seniors) and
at least 31 alumni met on Monday,
Feb. 13, in the Executive Dining
Room of the Chemical Bank Head-
quarters in New York.

Heatley said two W&L alumni who
work for Chemical Bank, Ollie
Mendell ’50, and Don Hogle °75, ar-
ranged to provide, free of charge, the
refreshments and the dining room.

Heatley said the students and alumni

’ arrived at around 6 p.m., signed in,

‘tand then just enjoyed visiting and
talking with each other; catching up

* on friendships and connections and

i

, an hour,

¥

discussing career opportunities and
work prospects.

‘*We let that go, at large, for about
an hour-and-fifteen-
minutes,’’ said Heatley, ‘‘and then,
by announcement, said that we would
have a breakout.

‘At that announced time, all the
students went around to different sides
and corners of the room where signs

‘ were posted about different career

. fields; advertising, sales, financial

:

services, investment banking,’’
among others, said Heatley.

‘*Very specifically, in those little
sectors, [the students and the alumni]

* talked about the things that concerned

 

them,”’ said Heatley.

According to Heatley the reception
went so smoothly that he had trouble
getting the students and alumni to stop
talking. He said, ‘‘We planned for
[the reception] to run from 6:00 to
8:00, and people got in there and en-
joyed it so much that we finally had to
break things off about 8:30 and let
people be on their way.’’

“We hope, by the grapevine effect,
that there will be more [alumni] that
throw in with this effort in New York
who actually have specific positions to
be filled,’’ said Heatley.

Some of the students who par-
ticipated in the event said they thought
the reception went very well consider-
ing it was the first time it had been
organized and that they found it to be
helpful.

Senior Stephanie Coleman thought
the reception was ‘‘a good idea’’ and
“a good start.”’

She said one particular [alumnus]
even gave her the name of a prospec-
tive contact.

Senior Scott Yates said, ‘‘There
was a good response and all the
alumni were very helpful in whatever
manner they could be.’’

Tom Herndon, also a senior, said
“Considering it was the first time, I
thought the turnout was good.”’

He said he thought the reception
was valuable because he was able to
gain experience in a social situation
like a professional reception. Said
Herndon, ‘‘The social situations help
you to get an interview in the first
place.”’

Herndon also said, ‘‘It was nice to
know that alumni are there and willing
to help.”’

Michael Patrick, a freshman, said
he participated in order to gauge what
employers are looking for
“‘education-wise’’ and also to look

costumed security guards will meet
you to stamp your ticket with the
official stamp of the Venice-
Simplon Orient Express.

The Warner Center, separated
into four different cities, will act as
an elegant ballroom while the
sounds of the Lester Lanin Or-
chestra sweep you off your feet.
Looking into the Warner Center
from the doorway, a scene from
Zurich, Switzerland, will sit in the
front left corner of the gym, a
scene from Paris, France, in the
right front corner, a scene from
London, England, in the left rear
corner and a scene from Istanbul,
Turkey, in the right rear corner.

The wall behind the Lester Lanin
Orchestra will be covered with
flags from Italy, England, France,
Austria, Turkey, Switzerland and
West Germany, all countries to

which the Orient Express travels.
On the opposite wall, where the
stairs lead up to the 500-level of the
Warner Center, there will be the
facade of a train station railway
platform with signs leading to
‘*Platform A’’ and ‘‘Platform B’’
up the left and right staircases.

On top of the balcony next to the
railing looking over the gym will
sit an actual-size replica of the
bar/salon car from the Continental
Train of the Orient Express. The
side of the 10 by 40 foot car to the
inside of the balcony will be open

like a cross-section so that viewers
can see the intricacies of the inside
of the car and so they can hear the
live pianist who will add extra
entertainment on the balcony level
from inside the car.

The Doremus gymnasium will
feature the facade of a train around
the upper railing that surrounds the
track. Silhouetted passengers will
appear as a light continually circles
the inside of the track giving the
impression that the train is actually
moving. The stage for the Fancy
Dress rock bands, The Young
Fresh Fellows and The Reivers,
will sit on the side of the gym op-
posite the administrative offices.

Perhaps as a fitting conclusion to

Residents question if city
can support more stores

By Eleanor Nelson
Staff Reporter

 

Lexington and Rockbridge area
shoppers may soon have too many
new stores to choose from.

Three new shopping centers are
scheduled to open in the fall of 1989,
a Wal-Mart on Route 11 just north of
Lexington and a K-Mart and Food
Lion on Route 60 just east of Lexing-
ton.

A new Harris Teeter will also open
this March in the former Safeway lo-
cation on East Nelson Street.

But, many local residents and mer-
chants question whether the Lexing-
ton and Rockbridge area can support
so many new stores. They are also
concerned about the effect these new
stores will have on the existing stores
in the area.

File Photo

Rockbridge County shoppers can
choose from Kroger, Lexington’s

Market, the Rockbridge Food Coop-
erative, White Front Super Market,
Food Lion and Quality (in Buena
Vista); they can also choose from
over seven convenience stores: Stop-
In, East Lexington Store, Woods
Creek Grocery, East Lexington Stop-
In and Sycamore Farm Market.

Maxway manager Norman Smith
said, ‘‘I really don’t think the area has
the population to support all these
stores,

‘People will probably go to the
new stores initially, simply to check
them out and take advantage of their
grand opening bargains and gim-
micks; We’ll have to do something to
attract them back to us.’’

K-Mart and Wal-Mart will have to
compete with Roses, Maxway, Leg-

get, Shoe Show, Pic ’n Pay, Peebles,
the Outlet Stores, The Thrift Shop
and others.

Local realtor Otis Mead said,
‘*People who come to the hotels and

the horse center are not typically go-
ing to shop at such stores as Wal-Mart
or K-Mart or shop at many grocery
stores.

“If the need and the market for
these stores is here, then it will be
good for the community; if the need is
not here, then it could be counter-
productive.’’

‘*When we talk about growing in-
dustry in Lexington, the bulk of it is
tourism, bringing in travel dollars,”’
Mead said. He added that most of
those dollars go to service facilities
catering to the travel industry such as
food, lodging, auto services and odd
sundries.

Lex says
‘NO way’
to one-ways

Lexington City Council considered
and rejected a recommendation from
the Virginia Department of Transpor-
tation last week that suggested mak-
ing Washington and Nelson streets
one-way.

One-way Washington and Nelson
streets have been considered before
and the answer is always the same —
it would be too disruptive to automo-
bile traffic and commerce.

City Manager Joe King said the
DOT’s recommendation was based
on the number of cars traveling on
those streets and safety factors.
However, it is only advice from the
state because the state has no jurisdic-
tion in this kind of matter, he said.

House Mountain for sale

Two conservation groups face fundraising deadline

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

Rockbridge County’s House Moun-
tain has been put up for sale, and two
conservation organizations have
started a $325,000 fundraising drive
to make sure the mountain is kept
open to the public and out of the hands
of developers.

The Rockbridge Area Conservation
Council and the Virginia Outdoors
Foundation have been granted an op-
tion to purchase more than 900 acres,
including both of the mountain's
peaks and the valley in between, but
the two groups must raise the entire
purchase price by April 8.

For more than 20 years, House
Mountain has been owned by David
White, who kept the land open to
hikers, campers and turkey hunters.
When White decided to sell the land
last fall, Lexington attorney Larry

ee ee

Mann organized the Save House
Mountain Committee to keep the area
undeveloped and open to visitors.

Mann enlisted the help of the VOF,
an organization created by the General
Assembly in 1986 to preserve the
state’s open lands for public use. He
secured a six-month option from
White to allow time for fund-raising,
and the VOF later obtained an exten-
sion so that the option will not expire
until April 8.

Mann, Tuesday, said his committee
had so far raised less than $50,000,
but he said he is ‘‘extremely en-
couraged’’ by community support and
confident area residents and students
will rally behind the project.

If the conservation groups are suc-
cessful, the land will become property
of the VOF, which owns nature
preserves in the Bull Run Mountains
in northern Virginia and at Smith
Point on the Chesapeake Bay

However, under its agreement with
the VOF, RACC will determine how
the land wiil be used.

House Mountain is about five miles
west of Lexington and just north of
Collierstown. The mountain rises
from about 2100 feet at its base to
peaks of 3386 feet at the top of Little
House Mountain, the peak closest to
Lexington, and 3645 feet at the top of
Big House Mountain.

Mann said there will be a walking
tour of the mountain Sunday for those
interested in showing their support for
the project. There are also plans for
local school children to write poems
about the mountain and for area high
school students to study the biology of
House Mountain, he said.

‘*We will have to work hard, but I
am convinced that, between the two
groups (RACC and the VOF), we can
raise the money to keep this land open
to the public,”’ said Mann
OPINION

Reflections
on FD 1989

It’s that time of year again.
People have been talking about it literally since Christmas — what
to expect, what to wear and most important, what will the theme be
for the 82nd Fancy Dress Ball?

An Evening Excursion on the Orient Express should prove to be
an extravagant ball. And as far as we know, there have been no
complaints. The Minority Student Association boycotted last year’s
Reconciliation Ball because the theme referred to the post-Civil
War oppression of blacks — news that made it into the Richmond
Times-Dispatch. Although the Student Activities Board made con-
cessions by not displaying the Confederate flag, not decorating with
a plantation motif and agreeing not to wear blue and gray uniforms, —

 

The Ring-tum Phi, February 23, 1989

 

MSA still boycotted the ball.

SAB’s $100,000 Orient Express Ball is non-racist, non-sexist,

inoffensive and harmless.

There is also a higher degree of professionalism in this year’s
ball. A professional (W&L alumnus) designer created the party
paraphernalia, normally done by a student and the SAB bought a
replica of the Bar-Salon car from the original Orient Express. The
ball should prove to be fancier than in the past, rivalling any recent

Inaugural Ball.

We would like to encourage everyone to use Live Drive so the
82nd Fancy Dress Ball will be devoid of drinking and driving in-
cidents. Live Drive is scheduling van routes from Thursday night’s
concert at the pavilion and Saturday night’s fraternity parties.
However, since there is no scheduled route for Saturday night,
fraternities are encouraged to inform Live Drive if they will need its

services.

Live Drive will not be operating Friday night since the ball is
within walking distance for most people.
We hope you have a safe and fancy FD!

Values should
guide IFC rules

 

MY VIEW
By Mark A. Robertson

 

Previously, I wrote that the Inter-
fraternity Council (IFC) is a reac-
tionary committee. The administration
tells fraternities 16 follbW thé Fakes)
and mandates that fraternities police
each other. Coercion forces submis-
sion. (Jan. 19, The Ring-tum Phi.
“Students Respond to Sessions’
Views on Law and Honor,’’ page 3)
Chi Psi President Peter J. Coleman
says that I am mistaken. Mr. Coleman
states, ‘‘The IFC is not a reactionary
committee. The IFC has no power at
all!’’ I stand corrected. Tragically,
over the years, regulation has usurped
the IFC’s power.

Inter-fraternity legislation is subject
to the ratification of the Student Af-
fairs Committee. More often than
not, I hear fraternity members talking
about what solutions SAC will ap-
prove, instead of their own solutions.
Unfortunately, it appears that SAC’s
faculty members are elected largely
on the anti-fraternity attitudes. The
corollary is that SAC does not always
act in the best interests of the fraterni-
ty system.

Today, an adversarial relationship
exists between the administration and
the fraternity system. Case in point:

“’ SAC’s Dean Buddy Adkins states,

‘*The obligation of a specific fraterni-
ty is to get as many people as possible

to stay in Lexington and study. What

the hell do you want to do, party five
days a week? You've [the fraternity
system] been playing this stupid
charade for years.’’ On the other side

“of the issue, Pi Kappa Phi President

Jimmy Holmes said, ‘‘If we didn’t ac-
cept these (bylaws) something worse
would be forced on us by the school. It
was only a matter of time.’’ (Zhe
Ring-tum Phi, ‘‘Atkins cites frat
‘charade’,’’ Jan. 8, 1987.)

Additionally, the faculty lobbied for
a deferred rush in 1985 on the premise
that ‘‘impressionable’’ freshmen
would develop scholarly habits before
purguing ‘active’ social lives. (SAC’s
‘Relationship Between Academic and
Fraternity Life,’’ 1985.) This social
limitation for the ‘‘purpose of aca-
demic preservation’ was a socially in-
tolerable restriction and, therefore,
SAC of 1985 tactfully ‘‘revolted.’’
Unlike today, the SAC of 1985 acted
in the best interests of the fraternity
system during this dispute. SAC
pointed out that deferred rush would
actually prolong an intense social ac-
tivity instead of reducing it. Next,
SAC prevented the proposition for
reform from snowballing with quick,
decisive, and mildly compromising
action. SAC stated, ‘‘We recognize
their concerns and hence we will
agree to de-emphasize fraternity af-
filiation.’’ Notice, SAC specifically
states ‘‘their,’’ meaning only the fa-
culty’s concern, and not the concern
of fraternity members.

In 1985, the fear of antisocial
reform was SAC’s primary motive for
stating, ‘‘It is the faculty’s respon-
sibility to provide an environment
which is conducive to scholarly pur-
suits in the classroom only. It is not
the responsibility of the fraternity
system to provide an environment
conducive to academics outside the
classroom.’ This statement is ob-
viously a subtle insult. It justly implies
that the faculty is derelict. In

SDI is a deterrent, not an umbrella

 

MY VIEW
By James Lake

There was much rejoicing earlier
this month when former Sen. John
Tower, President Bush’s choice to be
our next secretary of defense, said the
Strategic Defense Initiative, or SDI,
would probably not be a total shield
against an all-out Soviet nuclear
assault.

Well, forgive me for being picky,
but I never thought it was going to be.
The strategic defense initiative is
designed to do what it says it does —
defend strategic strength. A Soviet
nuclear attack would, first and
foremost, seek to destroy America’s
nuclear weapons. But the SDI would,
for the first time, create a means of
defending those weapons against
Soviet attack. With it in place, the
Soviets cannot be certain to win a first
strike, because the SDI is designed to
kill enough incoming missles to pro-
tect our ability to respond.

Thus, as Richard Nixon has pointed
out, ‘‘even if it were only 50 percent
effective, [the SDI] would so com-
plicate the calculations for executing a
Soviet first strike that no Soviet leader
could ever be confident of success.”’
If a Soviet leader is not reasonably
certain that his first strike will rule out
a retaliatory strike, he will not launch
his missles. Even the Soviets would
not launch a first strike unless it is all
but certain to be a pre-emptory one.

Furthermore, the SDI can be effec-
tive as a shield against an accidental
Soviet launch of only a few missles or
against a small attack by a non-

 

superpower. When only a few missles
are launched, even an unsophisticated
anti-missle system would have a good
chance of destroying the incoming
warheads. While it may be only a
good chance, it’s better than no
chance at all, which is what we have
today.

Nevertheless, ever since Ronald
Reagan introduced the SDI concept,
many in Congress and the media have
been criticizing it for not being
something it’s not supposed to be in
the first place — namely, a total shield
against any and every incoming mis-
sle, no matter how massive the attack.

The PDI, or Populatation Defense
Initiative, is what they’re talking
about, and such a defense system
would of course be much more com-
prehensive. The PDI is an umbrella
that would protect the U.S. from any
incoming missle. Such a system is
neither currently feasible nor likely to
be developed anytime soon. But the
current futility of the PDI in no way
makes the SDI less credible or

. We can and in fact must
have the SDI; the PDI, while a nice
idea, is a long way off.

Given those differences, here’s why
SDI is a must:

First, a history lesson. When the
U.S. possessed nuclear superiority
over the Soviets, our arsenal was a
legitimate’ deterent to Soviet expan-
sionism. The president could simply
warn Moscow, ‘‘cut that out, or I'll
turn Moscow into an ash tray.’’ And
so the Soviets, when threatened, had
no choice but to back down.

Today, however, there is no U.S.
margin of superiority; if there is any
difference between the American and
Soviet arsenals, Moscow has the edge.

Thus the policy of mutually assured
destruction developed. It’s acronym is
MAD, as is the thinking behind it.
MAD goes like this: if the Soviets in-
vade Western Europe, the man in the
White House just might be nutty
enough to get the world destroyed
over it. In other words, even knowing
the Soviets would retaliate immediate-
ly, an American president might be
willing to launch a nuclear attack to
halt Soviet aggression.

The problems with MAD, beside
the obvious moral questions, involve
the precursor to a U.S. launch. Ob-
viously the Soviet invasion of a
smaller nation — say, Afghanistan —
is not enough of a threat to solicit a
U.S. nuclear assault by even the most
hard-line president. Suddenly, the
nuclear force that has kept the Soviets
at bay no longer exists.

This is why we need the SDI — the
strategic defense initiative. Strategic,
because it preserves our ability to res-
pond to a nuclear assault. And,
believe it or not, that simple fact can
prevent nuclear war as effectively as
the PDI.

Imagine an escalating crisis, but one
that begins over a relatively small
Soviet transgression — say, the rein-
troduction of Kremlin forces into
Afghanistan. The U.S. demands a
pullout and sends ships and supplies to
nearby Pakistan. But the Soviets don’t
budge; they insist they are in to stay
because they were invited by the
Afghan government.

Tensions build; the U.S. troop
presence in Pakistan increases.
Americans near the Afghan border die
when Soviet jets bomb rebel supply
lines. The U.S. retaliates by firing on
Soviet aircraft.

4

Suddenly, the unthinkable becomes,
thinkable, and the need for the SDI
becomes critical. Here’s why: '

WITHOUT THE SDI: One side —
it doesn’t matter which —becomes so
afraid of a total nuclear war that it?
decides to launch what it hopes will be
a pre-emptory strike. The thinking is,”
“if we can just wipe out their missiles, ,
our people and most of their people
will be safe.’’ The equipment needed’
for such a strike is already in place, so,
the missiles could be launched in a
matter of hours. In less than a day, a‘
small Soviet bombing of Afghan supp-
ly lines could escalate into Armag-t
gedon. 4

WITH THE SDI: The president, the,
Soviet premier and other leaders on
both sides realize that a pre-emptory
first strike, while possible in theory, is,
by no means guaranteed. The SDI,
even though it has never been tested,}
prevents a first strike by placing doubt,
in the minds of those considering it.
The confrontation remains conven->
tional and is diffused when the leaders
of the two sides realize just how
dangerous their game has become.)

Thus the importance of the SDI is in
fact greater than that of more or im-'
proved offensive weapons. As Nixon}
has pointed out, the relative number of
strategic warheads in the two super-
power arsenals.does not matter nearly )
as much as the vulnerability that ex-
ists. Without a trent to a Soviet’
first strike, it n't matter how .
many weapons or warheads the U.S.
has. The best way to prevent nuclear ‘
war is to make it less winnable, and ,
the SDI would do just that. It is, in,
every sense of the word, a’
peacemaker, and one we cannot live ,
without.

CRC procedures violate student rights

To the Editors:

‘‘Date rape’’ has ordinarily been described as
nonviolent, but nonconsensual, sexual intercourse
between a man (the accused) and a woman (the
victim) who have not previously had a friendly re-
lationship. What concerns me, however, is that
most people fail to realize that ‘‘date rape’’ is no
different from ‘‘stranger rape’’ or ‘‘real rape.”’
Certainly no reasonable person could make a sen-
sible distinction between a rape that occurs be-
tween previously acquainted people and a rape
that occurs between strangers. Everyone has the
absolute legal right not to engage in sexual inter-
course at any time (with some exceptions for mar-
ried persons). Quite correctly, no state law makes
a legal distinction between ‘‘date rape’’ and
“stranger rape,’’ and the crime of rape is basical-
ly defined as nonconsensual sexual intercourse.
Moreover, rape has historically been one of the
most heinous crimes that a person could commit
(punishabie in Virginia by up to life in prison).

Considering the above, and the great stigma that
accompanies a rape conviction, I fail to perceive
where this institution discovered the power to
create the Confidential Review Committee (the
‘**CRC’’), a committee that has the authority to
expel a student for ‘‘date rape’’ while denying that
same student some of the most basic rights that are
essentiai to a fair and impartial hearing. It is true

that a private college is a self-governing institu-

‘tion that may impose more stringent standards of

conduct than state governments can a im-
pose on their citizens, and that private colleges are
also not subject to the constitutional requirement
of due process. But one must seriously question
the validity of the self-governing procedures of a
private college when those procedures become ex-
tremely prejudicial and inequitable.

The very fact that members of the CRC are ap-
pointed by the President of the College, and not
elected by the student body, is a highly offensive
notion. Additionally, the majority of the CRC is
composed of faculty members (not students), and
that directly conflicts with the legitimate claim to
a trial by one’s peers. While the creators of the
CRC attempt to justify placing a majority of facul-
ty on the CRC by arguing that an alleged victim
would feel more ‘‘comfortable’’ speaking to fa-
culty members than fellow students, this fact
about the CRC completely ignores the rights of
the accused. The feelings of an alleged victim
should not outweigh an accused’s valid claim to a
hearing by his contemporaries.

Not only are the creation and composition of the
CRC unjustified, but the procedures of a CRC
hearing resemble that of a medieval ‘‘kangaroo
court’. First of all, while the accused in a CRC
hearing is given the right to an ‘‘advisor’’, that

advisor is not even allowed to speak on the floor
during the hearing. Perhaps most repulsive about
a CRC hearing, however, is the fact that the
accused (or his advisor) is not given the right to
directly cross-examine the accuser. This fact flies
in the face of every notion of equitable treatment
of a person accused of a wrongdoing. The chances
of a fraudulent claim being discovered without the
utilization of an adequate cross-examination are
slim at best, and as a result the potential for inno-
cent people being sanctioned for uncommitted ac-
tions is greatly increased. The possible emotional
stress a direct cross-examination may place on an
alleged victim certainly cannot outweigh the
dangerous possibility of sanctioning an innocent
individual. Moreover, the accused in a CRC pro-
ceeding may not appeal all of the sanctions that
the CRC can impose upon him, and even those
sanctions that may be appealed are done so to a
group entirely made up of faculty members—once
again violating the claim to a trial by one’s peers.

I certainly see a legitimate goal behind the crea-
tion of the CRC. However, the current status and
procedures of the CRC are a perfect example of
how the ends do not justify the (inequitable)
means,

Sincerely,

Bill Varian

Recycling Center needs community support

To the Editors:

It was a pleasure to read Lori Richardson’s arti-
cle on the newly launched recycling effort at
WAL in the Feb. 9 issue of The Ring-tum Phi. To
be successful, the Recycling Center needs the ac-
tive participation of the entire community, and the
publicity generated by the article is just the sort of
thing that is needed.

Maria Colvin, Scott Dittman and I have sent
memos to faculty and staff, asking for their sup-
port and explaining what can be recycled and
how. We hope students will contribute, as well

Ou. way to help is to save discarded computer
paper at the 10 computer centers on campus. A
brightly colored request to recycle will be posted
in each of these centers.

The comparatively high value of recycled com-
puter paper helps defray the cost of recycling
other items that bring little income but are a major
source of waste clogging dumps and landfills.
(Aluminum is another source of income.) The
Recycling Center is not-for-profit and aims to be
self- supporting.

One important point of information that was not

mentioned is that the Rockbridge Area Recycling
Coalition is the brainchild of Rebecca Johnson,
who is the president, the wife of Asst. Professor
of Law Lyman Johnson, and herself a lawyer. She
has worked tirelessly on this project for a year and
a half and deserves proper recognition for this
major accomplishment.

PE credit debate
Is still in limbo

Decision may be made next fall

A A ERR i TEENIE
By Heather Midkiff
Staff Reporter

 

The proposal by the physical edu-
cation department to give only one-

fifths credit of the five part physical

education requirement for participa-
tion in an inter-collegiate sport has not
been approved yet.

According to Dean Elrod, ‘‘No ac-
tion will be taken on any long range

committee curriculum recommenda-
tion by the Courses and Degrees
Committee before next fall.’’

The proposal was one of several
submitted to Dean Elrod by the
physical education department. The
purpose of the proposals is for the

physical education department, as
well as other departments, to
reevaluate their department as part of
a long range study program.

Several students wrote a letter to
The Ring-tum Phi in response to a
previous article concerning the pro-

posal. This letter recommended an
alternative for the physical education
department: ‘*Allow 1/Sth a credit for

the first season of each varsity sport in
which the student-athlete participates.
(Each student would still need to ac-

‘Mozart

 

cumulate 5/Sths cr. hr.) ‘‘For each
subsequent season, in each sport, give

the student- athlete one credit hour of
graded participation, up to a total of
nine credits. (8 cr. hrs. + 5/5 cr. hr =
9 cr. hrs.)’’ In response to this pro-
posal, Athletic Director Bill McHenry
said, ‘‘I certainly agree with the
students; they should get adequate
credit for participation in sports.’’
McHenry said that the only difference
between the proposal of the students
and the proposal of the physical edu-
cation department is that the students

created a second part to their pro-
posal. McHenry said, ‘‘I am surprised
it (the proposal) has caused such a
furor since it would not affect current

students.’’ In regard to whether or not
he thinks the proposal made by the

physical education department would
affect either recruitment or student

participation in athletics, McHenry
said, ‘‘I can’t imagine coming to
school for only that reason. I don’t
think it will affect the turnout for
sports.’’ If the physical education
department is asked to reexamine the
proposal after the decision has been
made, McHenry said, ‘‘The physical
education department is certainly will-
ing to discuss any alternative pro-

posals.”’

plan for restoring Lexington’s down-

At the time, Phillips said, City
Council made only Main and Jeffer-
son streets one-way because one-way
traffic on Nelson and Washington
streets would have made traffic flow
too difficult.

‘The real problem was Washing-
ton Street, ’’ Phillips said. One-way
traffic on Washington would run too
much traffic through campus, unless
Lee Avenue was also made one-way,
he said.

Main and Jefferson streets were
made one-way when the city began
rebuilding all the downtown streets.
Phillips said City Council was look-
ing for a way to ease traffic flow and
permit more downtown parking.

While the streets were rebuilt, the
city installed storm sewers, under-
ground electric and phone wires,
brick sidewalks and new street lamps.
Street reconstruction was completed
in November 1976.

gave W&L women a chance to get to
know each other, as well as the new
sororities. Chi Omega, Kappa Kappa
Gamma and Kappa Alpha Theta fin-
ished the week by pledging a total of
259 women.

‘IT had a really good time during
rush,’’ said freshman Karen
Haosell((check spelling)). ‘‘Especial-
ly meeting the older girls.”’

EAch sorority began with a chapter
consultant, who will remain at W&L

until June. New consultants are ex-
pected for next year.

Theta Consultant Lynda Fairman
had nothing but praise for W&L. “‘It’s
exciting to be at W&L,’’ she said.
“It’s a campus that welcomes change
and progress.

‘This is one of the best envir-
onments for Greeks I’ve ever seen,”’
she added.

“I’ve been really pleased by the
support and encouragement shown by
both the administration and the student
body,’’ said junior Theta pledge
Melissa Roberts.

University President John Wilson
has expressed interest in sorority ac-
tivities and is planning to attend some
colony meetings, according to Fair-
man.

The sororities have weekly meeting
in Dupont Hall and the University
Center. Eventual housing is planned,
and the sororities will get permanent
meeting places at the same time.

Social activities already have
begun. Kappa, Theta and Chi O all
have programs encouraging _ their
pledges to get to know each other.

“I’ve gotten to meet a lot of people
I didn’t know before,’’ said sopho-
more Tara Parkinson, a Chi O pledge.
‘‘Our pledge trip this spring will help,
too.”’

Kappa and Theta are planning
pledge trips as well.

Chi Omega and Theta have already
elected their first officers, although
Kappa will wait until May to do so.
Chi O’s president is Keri Heinrichs;

Theta’s is Bitsy Hopper.

Financial obligations are essentially
the same for the  sororities—all
pledges pay a one-time building fee of
$75, as well as membership dues of
$35 a month. Pledge and initiation
fees were also paid.

Dean Leroy C. Atkins, who is in
charge of fraternity affairs, said Chi O
and Theta each have 86 pledges, while
Kappa has 87.

Thirty-eight seniors pledged; 84
freshmen women did.

Fairman stated the goal of sororities
at W&L: ‘‘We’re not looking to only
provide social activities for the
women,”’ she said. ‘‘We want to meet
all their needs—to enhance their
whole college experience.”’

Students choose
ski, sun & home

 

By Holly Buffington
Staff Reporter

 

No matter whether they went home,
skiing, to Cancun or even stayed at
school, W&L students gave their
Washington Holiday a thumbs-up.

Vacationing students could be found
in almost every hot resort area.
Freshman Susan Watkins spent her
break ‘‘all over Cancun’’ with 11
other W&L students. She decided to
go to Cancun ‘‘to escape the cold and
snow and to be able to wear lighter
clothes.”’

According to Watkins, the group
wanted to get some culture so they
rented mopeds to the Mayan Temple
ruins only to find that the hurricane
had blown them down. Adventures
similar to this were a daily occurrence
on their trip.

Freshman Chris Haley spent his
vacation in Aspen, Colo., with two of
his pledge brothers. According to
Haley, ‘‘We could not have asked for
better weather, and the skiing condi-
tions were great.”’

The recent armored car robbery and
the subsequent resignation of two
Virginia Military Institute cadets has
brought attention to the honor code at
VMI, which shares several
characteristics with the honor system
of W&L.

The process for dismissal under the
VMI honor code is very similar to the
process used at W&L. If a cadet
suspects there has been an honor code
violation, he reports it to one of two
prosecutors or the president of the
Honor Court. The prosecutor then
begins an investigation of the case.
Col. Royce Jones, director of cadet af-
fairs, said that a majority of cases are
dropped at this stage. :

If the prosecutor feels there is
enough evidence to bring the cadet to

five different colleges, ‘‘living from
Burger King to Burger King.”’

According to Prigge, the weather
was a big disadvantage—‘‘It was too
cold,” he said, but the trip was worth
it and he plans to make a tour of the
Southern states on the next vacation.

Sophomore David Johnston vaca-
tioned in Tampa, Fla., with nine of his
fraternity brothers. Johnston said the
group spent time water skiing, and go-
ing to bars and other types of
nightclubs. He said one advantage of
vacationing in Florida was that he
could stay with friends who live there,
making the trip less expensive.

Members of both the basketball
team and the swim team remained in
Lexington for the majority of their
Washington Holiday. According to
senior David Dietz, the swim team
stayed at school until Wednesday for
morning practices.

On Wednesday the swim team
drove to Mary Washington College
for the Atlantic State Swimming
Championships. Dietz said the meet
went very well, with the men’s team
winning their meet and the women’s
placing third. Dietz also said, ‘‘We
had two girls and eight guys qualify
for NCAA championships so I guess it
was worth giving up break.’’

trial, he writes the formal charges and
presents them to the accused cadet at a
pretrial hearing. At this hearing, the
accused is informed of the charges
against him. The cadet than has the
opportunity to explain his side of the
incident.

If the Honor Court finds that no
honor violation has been committed,
the case is dropped. If they are un-
sure, the cadet is asked to plead either
guilty or not guilty to the charges that
have been brought against him. If he
pleads guilty, the cadet leaves VMI; if
he pleads not guilty, he is brought to
trial.

Unlike the open hearings at W&L
the trials at VMI are closed to the pub-
lic. The cadet is altowed to find an at-
torney, fellow student or faculty
member to help iff his defense.

The VMI honor code extends off

campus as well.

lot more, and I think in the future that
will happen.

Heatley said he thought the recep-
tion was a success ‘‘as a pilot effort’’
but also thought the program could be
improved.

“The one consensus is,’’ said
Heatley, ‘‘that this kind of event
should be held in New York, not at the
beginning of the Washington Holiday,
but at the beginning of the Thanksgiv-
ing Holiday.’’

Heatley also said he thought alumni
response needed improvement. He
said next year he would try, among
other things, ‘‘to target ... five to ten
alumni in a given city and ask them to
make calls to at least five or ten others
... Getting the alumni to call some of
their friends, other alumni.”’

“It could well be, and this is just
hypothesis at this point, that next year
we would try the New York connec-
tions at the beginning of the

Thanksgiving Holiday and we would
try the Atlanta connections at the
beginning of the Washington Holi-
day,’’ said Heatley.

(continued from page 2)

short, SAC of 1985 rightly upheld that
academic integrity resides in teaching
values rather than fraternal restric-
tions. Today, however, SAC
predominately seeks academic integ-
rity through regulation of the traterni-
ty system instead of lauding the vir-
tues of academic accomplishment.
Anti-fraternity forces argue that
fraternities impose a large, unproduc-
tive and unnecessary time demand on
students. Fraternity involvement
forces its members to sacrifice their
devotion to academics. Anti-fraternity
beliefs compel SAC to mandate that
each fraternity appoints a
‘*Scholarship Chairman.’’ The
responsibilities of a Scholarship
Chairman is to provide a list of the
following: (1) all initiates and their
majors; (2) all members and pledges
at the end of each term; and (3) all
persons to be initiated. The office of
Scholarship Chairman is a sly inven-
tion. Anti-fraternity forces use this of-
fice to masquerade a stealthy inten-
tion. On the surface, the anti- fraterni-
ty forces say scholarship chairmen
will imbue academics as a fraternal
priority. Underhandedly, however,
anti-fraternity forces use the office as
a tool to gather data in their persistent
attempt to correlate fraternity in-
volvement and academic
underachievement. Unfortunately for
all, anti-fraternity forces have confus-
ed correlation with causation.
Regulation of the fraternity system
diminishes the value of this Univer-
sity’s diploma in two ways. Namely,
regulation denies fraternity members
the opportunity to practice two key
management skills: (1) problem solv-
ing and (2) planning. Fraternities are a
management proving ground. Frater-
nity members need concrete practice
sharpening their management skills.
Taking these management skills out of
the hands of fraternity members tapers
their management experience and,
thus, it diminishes their effectiveness
as managers in the real world. In
short, graduating less effective
managers devalues W&L’s diploma.
Academic integrity resides in values
instead of fraternity restrictions. Pass-
ing regulatory restrictions fails
because new laws cannot weed out
bad values entirely. Gentlemen and
ladies of the W&L community are
trustworthy because General Lee es-
tablished an honor system which ex-
pected trustworthiness from them. In
Dr, Taylor’s speech “‘The*Day of
General Lee’s Return to Lexington,”’
he speculates that General Lee would
have asked, ‘‘W&L obviously has an
atmosphere of trust, but does it have
an atmosphere of respect?’’ In Lee’s
words, the W&L community has ne-
glected the integrity of principle over
the years. It seems to me that integrity
has diminisned because the ad-
ministration fails to make it a daily
expectation of the fraternity system.
To remedy the situation, the ad-
ministration needs to challenge the
fraternity system to handle their own
problems responsibly. Using a
“*stick’’ to coerce responsible
behavior is doomed to fail. Alter-
natively, a ‘‘carrot’’ may motivate
responsible behavior in the fraternity
system. The ‘‘carrot’’ resides in Gen-
eral Lee’s concept of honor: ‘‘All
students are to conduct themselves
like gentlemen.’’ The fraternity
system desperately needs the ad-
ministration to expect integrity from
them. Expectancy theory substantiates
that institutions get what they expect
in most situations. Tradition shows
that W&L students respond favorably
when nurtured by positive expecta-
tions. General Lee states, ‘‘You
cannot force men to do their duty.”’
Similarly, the administration needs to
expect the fraternity system to do its
duty. In sum, values rather than
regulations make academic and
fraternity life compatible.

Swimming teams capture championships

Women take 2nd ODAC crown

 

By Amy Packard
Staff Reporter

 

For the Washington and Lee
women’s swim team, the theme of this
year’s season was ‘‘Back-to Back.”’
This referred to the goal of winning a
second consecutive Old Dominion
Athletic Conference championship.
Head Coach Page Remillard was not
overly worried about repeating and
predicted a winning performance.

“*Back-to-Back’’ was, in fact, a
very strong probability. So the fact
that the Generals did capture their
second ODAC title was not the most
phenomenal aspect of this year’s com-
petition. It is the way in which the
women won that warrants the most at-
tention and surpasses the aspirations
of any swim team in the division.

The accomplishments were nothing
short of miraculous, and Remillard
admitted that he often called upon a
higher power but did not expect such
results. The team broke 14 school
records, won every ODAC event and
was the only team to produce
qualifiers for the NCAA Division II
National Championships. And there’s
more: Every W&L swimmer finished
with personal-best times, everyone
scored and W&L boasted the ODAC’s
““MO8t Odtaetandinsg
Swimmer’’—senior Elizabeth

Miles—who also received the honor
last year. The final score was 601, a
point total which left Sweet Briar, the
second-place team, 147 points behind.

mics

‘The performance was a result of
commitment, confidence and execu-
tion,”’ said Remillard. ‘‘We also had
outstanding senior and freshman
leadership. The captains [Miles and
senior Nancy Whalen] deserve special
credit for promoting team unity.’’

Remillard also commented on the
particularly impressive individual
facts. ‘‘[Freshman}] Louise Adamson
entered the 500-yard freestyle with a
time of 7:22.43 and came out of the
preliminaries with 6:40.05. [Sopho-
more] Kris Amoroso came within one-
tenth of a second of breaking the
school record in the 100-yard
backstroke—the only record not
broken this year. And, of course,
Elizabeth Miles and [sopho-
more]Sharon Coleman qualified for
the Nationals.’’

Coleman qualified in the 200-year
butterfly with a time of 2:13.78, and
Miles qualified in the 200, 500, and
1650 freestyle events. Miles’ time in
the 1650 was 17:58.48, her best
overall performance.

“If there is a swimmer in the
ODAC better than Elizabeth, she
wasn’t at that meet,’’ Remillard said.
“*And all the ODAC swimmers were
there.”’

Remillard is more than satisfied
with the two ODAC championship
titles and the amazing occurrences of
this year’s competition. What’s the
team’s new slogan, now that the
**Back- to-Back’’ challenge has been
met? ‘‘Next year we’re going for a
hat-trick,”’ he said.

The men’s swim team captured its second straight Atlantic State’s

Championship.

Men grab Atlantic States title

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

  

For the Washington and Lee men’s
swim team, last weekend's Atlantic
States Conference Championships
was the meet of season. The Generals
were shaved, geared up and ready to
bring home a second consecutive con
ference crown as well as qualify
swimmers and relay teams for the
NCAA Division III National Cham
pionships. Times to turn up the per-
formance level a notch, eh?

*“We swam awesome,”
David Dietz, displaying a knack for
understatement. Awesome isn’t the
word. Try unbelievable, incredible or
fantazmagorable. Yes, the Generals
were that good.

W&L had every swimmer post a
personal best time in one of his events
en route to swimming away with its
second straight ASC title. The Gen-
erals outpointed their nearest rival
UNC-Charlotte by 125.5 points, set-
ting four school records and qualify-
ing eight swimmers in 24 events for
Nationals.

““You always expect to swim well,’’
said Dietz, ‘‘But it’s rare when every-
one swims so well.”’

Some of the highlights were when

Redfoot qualifies for Nationals

Most people would find it difficult
to some
endeavor requiring skill, timing and

| reflexes after taking over a year off

from it. Then again, most people are
probably not at all like Washington
and Lee senior wrestler Rich Redfoot.

After not wrestling his junior year
for the Generals grapplers because of
self-proclaimed ‘‘burnout,’’ Redfoot
sparkled in last weekend’s NCAA
Division II] Eastern Regional Cham-
pionships. Entering the competition as

Basketball drops three in a row
Sophomore Jacobs named ODAC Player-of-the-Year

 

By Jay Plotkin
' Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee basketball
team closed out its 1988- 89 regular
season on the road, and the treatment
the team received made it long for the
friendly confines of home.

The four-game road trip started for
the Generals down the road at
Roanoke. Earlier this season, W&L
beat the Maroons 102- 86 after trailing
47-42 at the half in the Warner
Center. This time, the Generals took
control early and held on to get their
first win in Roanoke in 31 years.

W&L never let Roanoke get un-
tracked, holding the Maroons to just
35 percent shooting in the first half
while cruising to a 41-27 lead. One of
the keys going into the game for the
Generals was to contain Roanoke
guard Pat Muldowney, who scored 22
points in the first game between the
schools. A_ stingy defense held
Muldowney to just eight points on
three of 14 shooting. The Generals
also needed a big game from their
leading scorer, sophomore center
Chris Jacobs, and he came through
with a 25 point, 12 rebound perfor-
mance.

The Generals rode the play of their
inside men, Jacobs and sophomore
forward Scott Alrutz, to earn the 78-
67 win. Alrutz scored a career-high 14
points, and classmate Jim Casey, a
5’10’’ guard, added a season-high 13.

The next stop for the Generals was
Eastern Mennonite, where W&L fin-
ished up its Old Dominion Athletic
Conference schedule. Last time, the
Generals beat the Royals 77-64 in
Lexington. This time, the Royals
stuck close to the Generals largely due
to their dominance on the glass. EMC
outrebounded W&L 45-31, led by
Tim Cressman’s 15 rebounds. The
Generals were also hurt by a poor

shooting night from the starting
backcourt of sophomore Mike Holton
and senior captain Lee Brading. The
duo combined for just 11 points on
five of 23 shooting.

Jacobs kept the Generals in the
game, scoring 25 points and clearing
11 boards. Still, EMC led by two with
just under two minutes left. Brading
tied the game for W&L at 65, but
Gary Chupp hit a running one-hander
at the buzzer to give Eastern Men-
nonite a 67-65 upset win.

Said Generals head coach Verne
Canfield, ‘‘Against Eastern Men-
nonite, we just totally didn’t respect
our opponent. That is inexcusable,
and hopefully the young men learned a
lesson from that.’’

WA&L then flew to Boston for games
with Tufts and Amherst. While the
stay in Boston was nice, the weather
was cold, and so was the welcome the
Generals received from their hosts.

WA&L stayed with Tufts for most of
the game. It was tied at 32 at halftime.
But Tufts used its inside strength to
control the boards, claiming a 45-31
edge. Towards the end of the game,
Tufts pulled away from the foul line,
making 18 of 34 for the game. The
Generals attempted only nine free
throws, making only two.

The discrepancy from the foul line
proved to be the difference, and Tufts
handed the Generals their second
straight defeat, 76-71, despite a ca-
reer-high 29 points from Jacobs.
Brading also added a career-high 10
assists.

Said Canfield, ‘‘We should have
won the Tufts game, but we didn’t ex-
ecute very well. The officiating was
unusual, but you have to expect that
on the road, and that’s not an excuse.
We didn’t play well enough to win and
we still could have won.”’

The road swing concluded with a
stop at Amherst. The Generals never
got it going offensively, shooting just

32 percent for the game, and Amherst
was able to keep Jacobs in check,
limiting the 6’6’’ center to just 10
points. Brading led the Generals with
15 points, while sophomore Pat
Gallavan and freshman John Wither-
ington added eight each, as Amherst
handed the Generals an 84-67 loss.

‘‘Amherst was a good basketball
team,”’’ said Canfield. ‘‘They have
basketball players that are very fine
Division Ill players, players that most
Division III schools don’t get.””

The loss left the Generals 19-6 on
the season, 10-2 in the conference.
The Generals will next take the court
tonight for Roanoke/W&L III in the
semifinal round of the ODAC tour-
nament at 6:30 in the Salem Civic
Center. The fifth-place Maroons
defeated Bridgewater on Tuesday
night to gain another shot at the Gen-
erals. Emory and Henry and Hamp-
den-Sydney play in the other semifinal
game at 8:30 p.m., with the winners
advancing to the championship round
slated for Saturday at 3 p.m. If the
Generals should win the ODAC tour-
nament, they would receive an
automatic bid to the NCAA Division
Ill championship.

‘‘We know what it takes to beat
Roanoke,’’ said Canfield. ‘‘It all
depends on the mental frame of mind
of our players. It is simply a matter of
who wants the game more.”’

Several Generals were honored as
the ODAC coaches voted on the all
conference teams. Canfield was nam-
ed Coach-of-the-Year for the third
time, taking a team picked to finish
fifth in the preseason all the way to the
conference regular season title.
Holton was named to the second team
all conference and second team All
South Atlantic Region. Jacobs was
voted to the first team and became the
first sophomore in league history to be
voted Player-of-the- Year. He was also
named to the first team all- South
Atlantic.

Counselor - the position currently held by Timothy G. McMahon - should submit a letter of
application to the Personnel Office by March 6, 1989. A personal interview will be scheduled

for finalists in mid-March.

 

the No. 2 seed in the 190-pound
weight class with a sterling 18-1-1
record, Redfoot earned a berth in the
NCAA Division III National Cham-
pionships by advancing to the final
round.

And he almost grabbed the title at
190 pounds as well. Redfoot, who
advanced to the final with a pin in the
last minute of his semifinal match,
took 1988 Division Ill All-American
Mike Fusilli from Ithaca into overtime
in the final match.

Redfoot, who qualified for the
national meet his sophomore year,
raced out to an early 5-0 lead and
almost had his opponent pinned. But

Fusilli hung tough, fighting back to tie
the score at 5-5 at the end of regula-
tion. Still deadlocked at the conclusion
of the one-minute overtime period,

Fusilli won the title on the basis of

more riding time.

Redfoot will compete at the national
tournament on March 3-4 at John Car-
roll University in University Heights,
Ohio, outside of Cleveland.

W&L also was well represented at
the regional meet by senior 177-
pounder Manoli Loupassi, who fin-
ished 2-2 in the tournament, and

sophomore 126-pounder Larry
Pilkey, who finished 1-2 in the
tourney.

said senior

the first time in his career. W&L also
qualified all of its relay teams,
something Dietz predicts could prove
to be important.

“We qualified all our relays for
Nationals—the first time in my four
years here that we have done that,”’ he
said. ‘That will definitely score us
some big points at Nationals, because
every relay team has the potential to
score in the Top Eight.”’

Dietz, Reavy, Copeland, senior Jeff
Bercaw, junior David Olson, sopho-
more Jim Dunlevy and freshmen Jay
Smith and Chip Nordhoff were the
qualifiers for the national meet

‘When every single swimmer turns

in a lifetime best, it’s the kind of meet -

you only dream about,’’ said head
coach Page Remillard. ‘‘But that’s the
kind of meet we had. Even more im-
portant than that, though, was the fact
that we had a lot of fun, too.”’

The national qualifiers now will
continue their training for the national
championships. The men’s champion-
ships will be held March 16-18 at
Bowdoin College in Brunswick,
Maine, and the women’s champion-
ships will be held a week earlier,
March 9-11, at the University of
Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind.

The Generals, who finished | 1th in *

the nation last year, will look to im-
prove on that past performance and
crack the Top Eight this season. A
Top Eight finish would be the highest
for a men’s swim team in W&L
history.

A Fancy Dress message from the President

February 20, 1989

Fancy Dress Weekend is a special moment in the University's calendar.
For some 82 years it has provided a burst of color and excitement to help

us all bid winter farewell and to welcome in the spring.

It is always a

treat to anticipate and, when it comes, to enjoy to the fullest. Faculty,
staff, and alumni all look forward to joining the students of the University

in this traditional event.

I know how very hard the work has been--how many hours, how much effort

and strain--to bring us to this point. On behalf of the thousands who will
be on hand, I express sincere gratitude to the members of SAB and especially
to the Fancy Dress organizers and volunteers who will shortly create for us
yet another memorable evening. We are really most deeply grateful.

An Evening Excursion on the
Orient Express is 82nd theme

 

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

Ladies and Gentlemen of the
Washington and Lee communi-
ty, the theme for the 82nd annual
Fancy Dress Ball is An Evening
Excursion on the Orient Ex-
press.

This year’s Fancy Dress
moves away from the place and
time balls of the past few years
and will again focus on the fine
and the elegant; the fancy if you
will. Everything chosen for this
year’s ball was chosen for its
quality, its distinction and for its
style. In short, An Evening on
the Orient Express should be the
finest Fancy Dress Ball that any
of us have experienced and one
of the finest W&L has ever seen.

As always, huge, bright
spotlights will criss-cross the
skies outside the Warner Center
signaling the beginning of an-
other Fancy Dress while banners
of gold and black hang from
each of the windows on the side
of the gym above the walkway.
Art deco edges will outline the
silhouetted dancers on each of
the 3 by 22 foot banners. A
pathway of lights underneath the
wall of banners will lead to the
red carpeted stairway flanked by
lighted trees at the front of the
Warner Center. Above the

doorway at the top of the stair-
way a sign of indigo, red and
gold highlighted by two
spotlights and numerous marquis
lights will read An Evening Ex-
cursion on the Orient Express.

Once you are inside the door-
way, professional costumed
security guards will take your
Fancy Dress ticket and will
stamp it with the official stamp
of the Venice-Simplon Orient
Express; the actual Orient Ex-
press that currently runs between
London and Venice.

In the right quadrant of the
lobby, a facade of a ticket
counter like that in Victoria
Station will stand with old lug-
gage, trunks and brass luggage
dollies. The hallways leading to
the Warner Center and Doremus
Gymnasium will be covered in a
dark royal blue paper with gold
trim. Various crests associated
with the Orient Express made
from gold paper will also adorn
the walls.

Across the hallway from the
doors closest to the ad-
ministrative athletic offices will
sit a Viennese garden with
various floral decor, trellises and
benches.

As you enter the Warner
Center, the Lester Lanin Or-
chestra will be sitting at the far

end of the gym. Behind it will
hang flags from Italy, England,
France, Austria, Turkey,
Switzerland and Hungary; all the
countries through which the
Orient Express runs. Gold
metallic streamers will scoop
down from and across the rafters
while lines of miniature white
lights of varying lengths hang
from the ceiling across the gym.

This year the Warner Center
will be divided into four cities,
each occupying a_ different
corner of the gym. Looking into
the Warner Center from the
doorway Zurich, Switzerland
will be in the left front corner,
Paris, France will be in the right
front corner, London, England
will be in the left rear corner and
Istanbul, Turkey will be in the
right rear corner.

The Zurich showcase will
feature paper mache facades of
the Alps that will rise up into the
bleachers. Small Swiss cottages
will sit at the bottom of the
make-believe mountains.

The Paris corner will feature a
20 foot tall model of the Eiffel
Tower that will be outlined in
miniature white lights. Foun-
tains set about four feet off the
floor will surround the bottom of
the tower in addition to various
greenery.

The London section will
feature a model of the London
Bridge with an illusion of the
Thames River flowing under it.
In addition, a facade of Big Ben
will rise up in the background
next to the bleachers.

Finally, the Turkey portion
will feature a gold Mosque or
Turkish temple that will be ac-
cented by red stained glass
windows.

On the wali opposite the Or-
chestra below the balcony will
hang the picture of the railway
platform of a train station. Signs
heading up each of the staircases
will read ‘*To Platform A’’ and
**To Platform B.’’ Once on top
of the balcony, you can see one
of the most exciting things about
this year’s ball - an exact, actual-
size replica of the bar/salon car
from the Continental Train of
the Orient Express. The 10 by
40 foot car will sit next to the
railing looking over the gym, but
the side of the car to the inside of
the balcony will open like a
cross-section giving viewers a
look at the intricacies and detail
of the car’s inside. Like in the
actual car, a pianist will play on
a full-size piano for added enter-
tainment on the balcony level.

The walls of the smaller
Doremus gym will be decorated

with art deco banners similar to
the ones that will hang next to
the walkway outside the gym. A
facade of a train with silhouetted
passengers will line the outside
of the railing that runs around
the track above the floor.
Throughout the course of the
Ball a light will run around the
inside of the railing illuminating
the silhouetted passengers as if
the train were actually moving
around the track.

The stage for the Young Fresh
Fellows and The Reivers will
again sit on the side of the gym
opposite the doors next to the
administrative offices. In addi-
tion, authentic cigarette girls
with cigarette boxes filled with
gum, matches, mints, cigars and
cigarettes will survey the floor
throughout the course of the
ball.

Then as the ball comes to a
close around 12:30 a.m. a
fireworks display will shoot up
over Wilson Field lasting for
about 30 minutes. All in all, it
promises to be extremely
memorable and exciting.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Welcome to An Evening Excur-
sion on the Orient Express, the
82nd annual Fancy ‘Dress Ball at
Washington and Lee University.
Let the festivities begin.

The Long and Winding Fancy Dress Road

 

By Marshall Bosweli
Alumni Staff Reporter

 

The official date given for the
first Fancy Dress Ball is Febru-
ary 1907. That's eighty-two
years ago for those of you
without a calculator. But that’s
not necessarily eighty-two Fancy
Dress Balls. Indeed, the history
of our little winter term shindig
is rich with anecdote and cultural
significance.

It is appropriate that we look
back at the origins of Fancy
Dress on this, its eighty-second
birthday. Although the common
belief is that a one Miss Annie Jo
White started FD all those years
ago, actually the idea of a major
ball was brewing long before her
initial efforts.

The first reference to a
‘Fancy Dress’’ anythingwas a
blurb in the September 27, 1876
issue of the Southern Collegian
concerning a ‘‘Fancy Dress
Hop.’’ For nearly a decade
before that, however, students
here had been putting on dances
and hops—without sanction from
the university—in off- campus
buildings, stables, or wherever a

band could set up and folks
could cut a rug or two. These
hops met with profound disap-
proval from campus authorities,
but the kids kept at it.

In December of 1871, the Col-
legian sent a reporter to W&L to
cover a hop put on by a
mysterious group of men calling
themselves, appropriately
enough, the ‘‘Student Social
Club.’’ The reporter described
the men as ‘‘elegantly dressed,”’
while the women these fellows
were lucky enough to be escor-
ting were dubbed ‘‘simply
bewitching.”’

**The Fancy Dress Hop’ that
followed several years later was
called a ‘‘great success’’ by the
Collegian and this inspired a
series of similar endeavors, the
most creative of which was the
*‘Finals Ball’’ held during exam
week of 1879. The Collegian
reporter complained that this
particular dance was simply too
short: it ended at 3 a.m..

Public sentiment was in
violent opposition to this new in
terest in balls and hops.

Protestant churches and
trustees rose up in anger against
this “‘licentious”’ flurry of activi-
ty. One fellow, observing the
1879 commencement exercises,
said he ‘feared the passing of
old times.’” He went on to say,
‘‘What would ‘Stonewall’
Jackson think of the youth in
Lexington dancing to the licen-
tious german or disgusting
racket?’’ Lastly, he worried that
the girls were doing simply to
much hugging.

Even the Gazette concurred,
writing ‘‘The time has come for
the public sentiment of the
Christian people of Lexington to
discountenance the lascivious
dancing which we are sorry to
say is being introduced here. ”’

But iocal satirist
*G.Whilikins, fought back with
these wise words: ‘‘As long as
there is music and young folks, it
will get (sic) into their
toes...Girls like to be hugged,
and the boys like to hug them.
The question is whether it is
better to do it in the ballroom or
behind the door.”’

The first real Fancy Dress Ball
came a decade later. The
school’s then-current librarian,
Miss Annie Jo White, entertain-
ed a group of her student friends
with a costume party one Febru-
ary evening in 1907. Because
she felt that the students needed
something to spark up the mid-
winter dullness, she sought to
make the affair an annual event.

It took some doing, but she
eventually rustled up enough
student enthusiasm to make the
Fancy Dress Ball one of the
highlights of the W&L social
calendar. Miss White was the
undisputed Queen of Fancy
Dress for 13 years, and in later
years was even paid $50 for her
services.

It was after her death in 1922,
however, that the Fancy Dress
Ball really took off. By 1928,
The New York Timesdescribed it
as ‘‘the South’s outstanding col-
legiate social event,’ even
though that ball was something
entirely different from the event
we celebrate now. For starters,

it was a costume ball, elaborate
and glittering, With exotic
European themes. setting the
pace. Famous big bands fre-
quented the ball and the music
was routinely broadcast on net-
work radio hook-ups all over the
nation. Fancy Dress, it has been
observed, began the same year
Henry Ford was working on the
first Model T: it was the
quintessence of the Edwardian
Age.

Fancy Dress was elaborate,
aristocratic, imaginative and
even perhaps snobbish. But it
was born out of an earnest desire
to create a wonderland here on
campus, and more often than
not, succeeded.

There were no Fancy Dress
Balls during the second World
War, and the tradition didn’t
quite survive the turbulent Six-
ties, but through it all, Fancy
Dress just seems to keep cropp-
ing up every winter like a breath
of fresh air.

Off to the ballroom, ladies and
gentlemen.

Freshman Perspective

 

Female

By Pam Kelley
W&L Freshman

 

 

Well, what to do about the big
“*F word” is no longer a dilem-
ma: I received a bid for Fancy
Dress. Where does it all go from
here? As a freshman, I’ve ab-
solutely no idea what goes on
during Fancy Dress weekend; so
I decided I would collect infor-

mation on ‘“‘F.D.’’, as_ it’s
called, and piece it together for
myself.

I asked the brothers of the
fraternity house I’m going to for
F.D. to tell me what will be go-
ing on for the most part: I got a
lot of stories about girl friend
swapping and incidents that are

Sophomore Perspective

juicy tidbits for games like ‘‘I
never.’’ TheSe stories basically
hint at the underlying itinerary
for the weekend, I think.

As for the formal itinerary, of
course there will be a Thursday
night concert, followed by ‘‘the
big night on Friday,’ then the
houses will part ways and create
their own activities. These ac-
tivities, combined with the in-
formal itinerary, amount to what
one person described to me as a
*‘drunken fest.”’

Of course, after these
enlightenments and revelations I
have to admit that my previous,
characteristically freshman vi-
sions of ‘‘moonlight and roses”’

have somewhat changed. I am,
however, looking forward to
Fancy Dress. I mean I’ve got a
great date, he’s got great friends
who we'll party with, they’ve
probably got great friends, and
we'll all probably all get along
even better when everyone gets
in the FD spirit. I am, however,
a little skeptical about this date-
swapping thing...

I also decided though, after all
of my sleuthing that what will
happen at Fancy Dress is the
least of my worries, I mean I’ve
got to get those shoes dyed to
match my fabulous dress and
think about accessories, possible
nail polish colors and....

As we were walking to the
party, I popped the question.

‘*Hey,’’ I smoothly said, **do
you want to go the FD with
me?”’

She looked at me and
hesitated. As she was thinking of
a reply, my mind scanned
through the names of other peo-
ple. ‘‘What if I don’t get a
date?’’ I pondered.

“Well, I don’t know,’’ she
said.

**What do you mean you don’t
know,”’ I exclaimed.

“OK, I'll go...I guess,’’ she
said.

‘*Wonderful,’” I thought.
‘**My date to the biggest week-
end of my life guesses that she
will go with me.”

**All right,’ I thought. ‘‘Two
weeks to Fancy Dress. Time to

make dinner reservations, get
flowers, buy tickets and get my
tux cleaned.”’

Unfortunately, my date in-
formed me that she had tests un-
til Friday afternoon and would
come up around 6 p.m.. Tests,
right.

She ended up coming to W&L
at about 7:45 p.m., we never ate
dinner, I forgot to buy flowers,
well, basically we hated each
other.

The first thing she said to me
when she arrived was that she
had made other sleeping ar-
rangements with a girlfriend of
hers in another W&L guy’s
room. So my first Fancy Dress
was Off to a terrible start but the
funny thing was that I really
didn’t care because my date
wasn’t looking too hot and the
next stop was the fraternity
cocktail party. Even funnier,
after I had indulged myself at the

cocktail party she wasn’t looking
any better.

We finally made it to the ball
at about 10:30 p.m. where I, ah,
unintentionally lost my date.
After talking to some friends of
mine and dancing with other
girls, I decided I should find her.
When I found her she said that
she was tired, had a headache
and wanted to leave. I walked
her to her friend’s room and then
proceeded to my fraternity house
where I concerned myself with
forgetting the evening.

The next morning my date
showed up for brunch at the
house and after eating heartily,
left with her girlfriend to go to
another fraternity party. After
she left I decided that the morn-
ing deserved to be forgotten just
as much as the night before.

I didn’t see my date again until
10 p.m. that night at our band
party. She only stayed about ten
minutes and then left. It was the
last I would see of her. But again
I didn’t really care because my
beer goggles were setting in and
there were plenty of other
women around.

Overall though Fancy Dress
was a great weekend, that is,
when I wasn’t with my date. I’m
really looking forward to this
year’s FD. I can only hope that
my date will be more bearable.

I’ve heard quite a lot about the
Fancy Dress Ball and I’ve seen
the posters and T-shirts, but I
still don’t know quite exactly
what to expect next week. The
closest thing I have to compare
Fancy Dress to is my senior
prom but from what I’ve heard,
however, FD has been much
more extravagant in the past than
any high school prom. I mean
we never had big name bands
like The Fixx in high school, and
none of our social events lasted
from Wednesday until Saturday
night as does Fancy Dress.

The Second Time Around.
From the very beginning, we all
knew our sophomore year would
be different. The excitement of
being a freshman and the atten-
tion associated with being a new
face on campus were gone. A
crowd of entirely new faces had
appeared, just when we thought
we knew everyone.

Depressing as it was, we were
no longer the center of attention,
and we had to learn to deal with
it. We adjusted also to no longer
being part of a freshman dorm
hall, with all our classmates
within a short jog across the
quad, and no longer being forced
to eat our meals together in
Evans. The good aspects of these
*‘privileges’’ were obvious; we
had been longing to be out of the
dorms and out of a permanent
ticket to the dining hall.

The catch though — and there
always is a catch — was that we
would no longer see many of the
people who wereonce just down
the hall, across the quad, or right
downstairs.

The impact of this may have
been minimal to some, but I
know I had taken for granted the
idea that we'd all still be
together. Now I’m lucky if I see

Special FD Memories

tendency of students to not at-
tend class on Friday. I think I’m
looking forward to that quick
break more than anything.

Yeah, when I think about it,
nothing we ever did in high
school could hold a candle to
Fancy Dress.

Fancy Dress of course will be
fine and dandy but my expenses
next week will also be far above
any high school Friday night
costs I have ever paid. Sure,
proms are expensive, but by the
time I pay for tickets, dinners,
flying my girlfriend in from
Texas and other assorted ex-
penses, I’ll need to take out a
loan.

It will probably be worth it all
though. I guess I'll find out
when it’s all over.

some of the people who were on
my hall last year once a week on
the hill.

What does all this have to do
with Fancy Dress? Well, to tell
you the truth I’m not really sure
myself. However, perhaps the
sophomore’s perspective may
now be better understood. Thus
far, all we've had to compare
our W&L experiences to have
been the relics of the freshman
year. Looking upon Fancy Dress
this year, some of the excitement
must still be there.

Fancy Dress itself is supposed
to be special, and the fact that
your date is someone special
lend themselves to creating at
least a little thrill. I suppose a bit
depends on your F.D. experi-
ences Freshman year. I'll try not
to hold that up as a standard of
comparison, though, because it
would be very difficult to top.

By this point, I think we’ve
pretty much adjusted to the fact
that the sophomore year is just
“‘there’’ unless you make
something more of it. Now I
think we’re ready to give Fancy
Dress a whirl, and to see how,
with a new attitude or an extra
effort, we can make this year
special in a way we had never
thought it could be.

Junior Perspective

 

Female

By Lori Richardson
W&L Junior

 

 

It’s FD season. Like the first
day of hunting season, you can
hear the dating calls beginning
the week after Winter Break.
W&L men search for the perfect
date, the dates search for the
perfect dress, the SAB wants the
perfect decorations and all an-
ticipate the perfect time. FD is
one of the most memorable oc-
casions at W&L. But, even so,
something could go wrong.

My freshman year, everything
that could have...did. First, the
boy who I had wanted to ask me
(a crush from the first week of
school no less), didn’t. The math
test (not my strong suit) sched-
uled for 2 p.m. Friday was a
nice bit of foreshadowing of the
weekend to come as well. Next
mistake, taking the plunge into
one of the local beauty salons
(using the word lightly) to get
what I thought was going to be a
manicure. One hour of gossip-
about-people-I-don’t-know later,

my nails were covered in horri-
ble swirling pools of orange mud
polish. It took another hour for
my roommate and I to undo the
damage.

It took about three girls to
force on the previously perfect-
fitting dress over a body that had
been consuming various drinks
for about three hours. A slight
loss of hand-eye coordination
may have made things a bit more
difficult too. In addition, I made
the dreadful mistake of wearing
a full length gown with zillions
of petticoats. Taking up most of
the compact car in which we
drove to Doremus made seeing
out the front and side windows a
true challenge for me and for the
driver. NO joke.

The picture of politeness the
entire week, my Jekyll/Hyde
date must have been transformed
by the sight of the dazzling
spotlights and not-so-dazzling
baby elephant that greeted us at
the front door. Things went
downhill...fast. To make a long
story short, a friend of his ended

up walking me home. (With en-
thusiastic permission from my
date of course!) I quickly went in
search of my roommate at her
date’s fraternity house. The
morning after overly-drowning
my sorrows, I had my first Alka-
Seltzer. (Ever try putting one of
those in your mouth by mistake?
Don’t!)

I knew I never wanted to see
Mr. Hyde again. He never
wanted to see me again either.
What a disaster! What happened
next? Venturing to the fraternity
house of a friend, I stumbled
upon the boy I had been dying to
have ask me. It turned out, he
hadn’t asked anyone. | was so
excited to hear that. We danced
the night away, which more than
made up for the previous night’s
fiasco. Now he tells me he had
wanted to ask me, but thought I
wasn’t interested. (Typical,
huh?) This year, he asked some-
one, I think about a month ago.
Lucky girl. I accepted in a heart-
beat. This year, FD will finally
be perfect.

Senior Perspective

 

Male

By Kevin Struthers
WA&L Senior

 

Before I matriculated as a
freshman in the Fall of 1985, I
had already heard about Fancy
Dress. This was not just a dance,
this was the dance and the social
event of the year. My father,
who attended Randolph-Macon
College, Ashland, even made a
road trip during the 1940s to
crash the dance. I was prepared
to encounter the most elegant
and lavish event of the year:
Washington and Lee's Fancy
Dress Ball. Carnaval was quite a
spectacle. I enjoyed the entire
evening, but it wasn’t quite what
I had in mind as a ‘‘ball’’ in the
Cinderella sense. What I en-
countered were a number of
students attempting to awkward-
ly dance like their parents
through a wall-to-wall inch of
beer slosh, hazardous to all
shoes and long dresses.

Gone are the days of ‘*wet”’
Fancy Dress, perhaps to the
chagrin of the University
Cleaners. Beer was served at
The Dark Continent, the Ball of
1987, but not on the main dance
floor. Instead, it was served in
what the SAB called a ‘*Beer
Garden.”* It was in this re-
stricted area, on the balcony
overlooking the new gym, that I
had my most memorable Fancy
Dress experience.

My former girlfriend and I
were in the Beer Garden with
what appeared to be every other
person at the ball. Lots of
smoke, lots of beer, lots of
bodies. It seemed like a typical
frat party, except everybody was
dressed to kill. All present were
trying in vain to look as dry and
comfortable as they could,
which was not easy in twenty-
five layers of tuxedo and taffeta.
Again, the floor was hazardous
to all, except for those who like
to take beer baths.

We had just arrived a few
minutes earlier from a cocktail
party where my date had maybe
one drink, one and a half Cape
Cods at the most. At this party
she had a few cheese and
crackers, but she really hadn’t
eaten anything all day. We were
standing in the back of the
balcony, away from the railing
next to a wall decorated with
bright splattered paint and a few
bulky, awkward palm-tree-type
objects. Everything was just
fine, and then it happened. I
looked over and I saw a mass of
black velvet sprawled on the
floor in the muck. She had
passed out cold.

I tried to wake her, but it was
to no avail. A couple of my
friends picked her up and tried to
walk her around a little bit,
while | tried to figure out what to
do. Trying to act casual, suave
and debonair as one’s FD date is

passed out amidst the entire stu-
dent body is not easy. There was
no place to walk - the front of the
balcony was packed, and the
stairs leading up from the gym
floor were filled with two steady
streams of thirsty bodies, all
heading upstairs, of course.
Finally, two SAB security
men came over and said,**Hey,
she looks like she’s had quite
enough.’’ So off they carry my
date, with me trailing behind
them as they walk out the back
steps. Behind me followed three
other couples who had joined us
at the ball. This was not a good
way to try to avoid being notic-
ed. ‘‘Give her another drink.”’

changed. From being the eager

My freshman year, I was real-
ly fired up about Fancy Dress.
That was all people had been
talking about throughout the
winter term. Before winter
break, I gave a_ half-hearted
effort at looking for a date, even
though I knew all along that I
was going to bring up my red-
headed hometown honey. Sure
enough. on Thursday of THE
week, she showed up at the
Roanoke airport. Friday night
was great. However, Saturday
just wasn’t to be. She drank too
much and proceeded to whine a
lot, not that I did, so I gladly sent
her on her way on Sunday. Still,
not all things were that bad, if
you know what I mean, and she
had paid for the plane ticket.

Sophomore year, | was all
ready to ask this one chick who I
felt | owed something to (who
will remain nameless). Then,
when I got home from break, I
had several people tell me that

**She ought to be fun tonight.”’
**Look at her - go let her throw
up, she'll feel better.’ That’s all
I heard as we passed what seem-
ed like two zillion W&L
students, staff and alumni. The
entire time, I of course was try-
ing to act concerned, yet still try-
ing to maintain that **No, I'm
not embarrassed”’ look.

As our entourage started down
the back steps a rush of cold out-
side air blew up the stairwell.
My date started to come to,
much to my relief. As we sat
down outside on the front steps
of the Warner Center, a baby

to the gym to splatter paint the
back wall, to now ducking into
dark corners when I hear Liz
Smith’s or David Grove’s voice
because I have yet to sign up for
SAB hours. Also, I remember
dashing through Graham-Lees to
see if my friends got ‘‘the bid’’
from their favorite senior
crushes while this year my
roommate is attending the Ball
with her fiance (watch out, he
was her date sophomore year,
this too could happen to you).
The one thing that has not
changed about F.D. is the good
times had with my friends and
the escape from academic

she had done more than just
sleep at Hampden-Sydney all
that week. Don’t worry, I wasn’t
that upset, but I did realize that I
needed a date, and quick. |
called up an ‘‘ole’* buddy of
mine who I thought I was going
to have a fun time with. All she
did was cost me a fortune while
running around hugging
everybody she saw but me. I
probably didn’t see her for more
than several hours all weekend.

That now brings me to this
year. Even though I’ve had some
interesting experiences the last
two years, I'm really excited
about this one. I even asked a
sweet little freshman girl before
break, which is a miracle for
me. In concluding, I have just a
little’ advice for the
underclassmen - watch out for
the coppers. I’m not saying
whether I am speaking from per-
sonal experience or not, well
maybe I am, but they have been
known to make a few arrests
during the weekend. See you
there.

walked out of the building. My
date later recalled, ‘‘Kevin, I
swear, everything was just fine,
I was standing beside you, then
everything went black. I don’t
remember anything after we
were upstairs. I just remember
awakening to the sight of a large,
swaggering baby elephant butt
complete with smell and leather

Blues legend B.B. King

 

highlights Thursday night

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

It’s a long way from the cotton
plantations of Mississippi to the
sleepy town of Lexington,
Virginia. Especially if you take
the route that B.B. King has
taken.

Born Riley King in 1949 on a
cotton plantation in Mississippi,
the man we have all come to
know as ‘‘the King of the Blues”’
has transcended more barriers
than most of us will ever face.
After leaving Mississippi and
hitchhiking to Memphis, Ten-
nessee in 1947, King found his
first bit of success as a local disk
jockey calling himself ‘‘The
Beale Street Blues Boy’’ after
the address of the station. His
success as a DJ and as a per-
former led to a recording con-
tract with RPM records where
he recorded ‘‘Three O'Clock
Blues’’ in 1951, a rhythm and
blues hit that would go all the
way to number one.

From there, B.B. (‘Blues
Boy’’) King began building a
reputation and career in blues
and in the music industry that
few have equalled. It didn’t
come easily though. King learn-
ed quickly what ‘‘paying dues”’
was all about as he set out to
market his unique form of
music,

As a southern black man in the
1950s, however, King was
somewhat relegated to playing a
series of black clubs throughout
the south called ‘‘the chitlin cir-
cuit."’ For the next 15 years,
King entertained over 300 nights
a year in these clubs before final-
ly ‘crossing over’’ in 1966 with
a performance at San Fran-
cisco’s Filmore West with The
Rolling Stones. That perfor-
mance, just as Jackie Robinson’s
emergence on the baseball field
in 1947 smoothed the way for
the black athlete, helped build
the foundation for the
trancendence of the black enter-
tainer into the world of predom-
inantly white venues.

The Fabulous Wallers kick-off Fancy Dress

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

The opening night of the Fan-
cy Dress weekend is an exciting
event in itself, but when you
open the weekend with the
Fabulous Waller Family, it is
sure to be super exciting.

The Waller Family is a
brother/sister quintet from
Richmond who have put together
a live show that is second to

Since then, King has con-
tinued to build his career as both
a musician and as a humani-
tarian. Musically, King has re-
corded over 50 albums and has
won two Grammy awards;
awards which many believe are
the most prestigious in the music
business. He won his first
Grammy in 1971 for ‘*The Thrill
is Gone,’’ a single that would
later go platinum for selling over
one million copies. Then in 1982
he was honored again for his
1971 album There Must Be A
Better World Somewhere.

In addition to his two
Grammys, King has been
awarded numerous honors by
the NAACP, the B’Nai Brith
Humanitarian Award, The
Memphis State University Dis-
tinguished Achievement Award
given in memory of Elvis
Presley in 1982, Top Blues
Guitarist by Guitar Player
magazine, Top Blues Artist by
Downbeat magazine in 1975 and
1976 and Best Male Instrumen-
talist and Best Male Blues Singer
by Ebonymagazine.

As a humanitarian, King has
traveled to more than fifty coun-
tries in North America, South
America, Europe, Australia,
Africa, the Middle East and
Asia. In 1979 he became the first
popular American singer to tour
the Soviet Union. Even though
the Russian people had never
heard any of King’s music, over
100,000 people showed up for
the concert.

King’s largest humanitarian
contribution, however, has been
his involvement with FAIRR,
the Foundation for the Ad-
vancement of Inmate Rehabilita-
tion and Recreation which King
founded with attorney F. Lee
Bailey. FAIRR was designed to
improve the morals and
rehabilitation efforts within the
prison systems through exposure
to the arts. In addition to his
guidance of the program, King
has given over 40 prison con-

certs across the United States.

none. Five pieces of live brass
will highlight the vocal talent of
the family group in addition to
the multiple costume changes
and tight choreography that have
become trademarks of their per-
formances.

Musically, they range from
“Top 40°’ to ‘‘Pop,”’ from
‘Soul’? to ‘“‘Rhythm and
Blues,’” from ‘‘Funk’’ to
‘*Beach Music’’ and from ‘Big
Band Music”’ to the ‘Monsters

World-renowned blues artist B.B. King will be the highlight of Thursday night’s pavilion concert.

Since 1966, King and his best
friend, guitar Lucille, have con-
tinued to tour giving from 250 to
300 performances a year. Why?
Because he loves performing and
playing the blues.

‘*The people in Boston are go-
ing to see the best show I can put
on,”” he said in a recent Boston
newspaper article. ‘‘You can’t
go out there with any less emo-
tion today than you did 40 years
ago, an entertainer should never

of Motown.”’ It seems that the
Waller Family can perform just
about any form of popular
music. The Family’s repertoire
includes selections by Earth,
Wind & Fire, Gladys Knight,
Michael Jackson, Stevie
Wonder, Terence Trent D’ Arby,
Whitney Houston, Luther Van-
dross, Prince, The Time and a
special extended medley of
Motown impressions featuring
the music of The Pointer Sisters,

do that. You do what you have to
do to put on the best show you
can — each time. You never

You can rest assured that B.B.
King will hold nothing back
when he headlines the first night
of Fancy Dress activities at the
student activities pavilion next
Thursday night. Yes, B.B. King
has come a long way since he
borrowed $15 from his planta-
tion boss to buy his first guitar.

During the past five years the
Waller Family and their band
have performed in forty-five
different states in addition to
performances in Santo Domingo
and Canada. Each year they per-
form more than 150 one-nighters
both nationally and_ interna-
tionally. They are the _ self-

though, B.B. King’s path has
brought him to sleepy Lexington
for a night of blues, a night of
history and a night of enchant-
ment. What a better way to start
the most celebrated weekend of
our social year. Mr. King, we

For those of you spending
your Fancy Dress evening in
Doremus gymnasium at the rock
side of the ball, you are in for a
treat and for a very unique even-
ing of music. After The Reivers
finish their set a four-man band
from Seattle called The Young
Fresh Fellows will take the
stage. What they will do with it,
we have no idea. We do know,
however, that The Fellows are
fun and they’re hot. Perhaps
their press release can best ex-

band.

‘*The name YOUNG FRESH
FELLOWS, was derived from
the idiomatic French axiom
‘einer Sache Wurze verliehen’
[Though we at the Phi argue that
this is German, the press release
argues otherwise], which loosely
translated means: ‘to add zest to
something.’ It is this very zest
for the musical profession that
has resulted in critical raves and
unparalleled financial rewards
for the four precocious lads from
Seattle.’’

But when Chuck Carroll, Tad
Hutchinson and Scott Mc-
Caughey (pronounce it ‘McCoy’
OR ELSE) completed work on

the debut YFF Ip, The Fabulous
Sounds of the Pacific Northwest,
they had little faith in such a
future. Though they recognized
the record as being imbued with
genius, it was beyond their
oracular scope to conceive of
anyone actually buying the damn
thing. One could cite the
disastrous commercial showings
of many similarly spectacular ar-
tistic endeavors: Song Cycle by
Van Dyke Parks, Neil Young’s
Tonight’s the Night, The Beach
Boys Love You, The Second
Album by Richard Peterson, etc.
But as history has already foot-
noted, Fab Sounds became an
overnight success and catapulted

ducer/Poplilama head, Conrad
Uno, to the forefront of the

ding universe.”’

“Bassist extraordinaire, Zoot
Sandstone, joined shortly
thereafter to allow McCaughey a
greater degree of irresponsibility
in the group’s extravagant ‘live’
presentation. Having studied
Julliard with Pastorius, Zoot’s
technical training was im-
mediately put to use on the sec-
ond YFF Ip, Topsy Turvy,
released at the end of 1985. Ac-
claimed at the time by publica-
tions from Rolling Stone to
Forced Exposure, Turvy has
since become a fixture on many
prominent lists of the Top Ten
Rock Albums of All-Time. As
Tom Waits stated in a discussion
of the record during a Downbeat
interview, ‘That is one mess ‘o
my hot guarantee!’ ”’

**A gruelling 1986 tour sched-
ule kept THE FELLOWS out of
the studio (except for the noto-
rious Squirrels project Ernest
Anyway and the Mighty Mighty
Squirrels Sing the Hits of Johnny
Kidd and the Pirates and some
work backing the great Jimmy
Silva) until December, when the
third LP sessions commenced,
again with Uno in the producer’s
sofa. The explosive results, The
Men Who Loved Music became
the first Popllama/Frontier col-
laborative effort and not coin-
cidentally the best selling YFF
album to date. It featured guest
shots from Terry Adams of

NRBQ and Jonathan Segel of
Camper Van Beethoven, among
others. The smash, ‘Amy
Grant’, helped earn the band a
new moniker: ‘The Worst Funk
Band in the World.’ The rest of
1987 saw more national touring
(often in tandem with those
Replacements), the retrospective
mini-LP, Refreshments, (again
on Popliama/Frontier) and the
San Francisco Giants collapse in
the NL playoffs.”’

“Totally Lost, the fourth LP
that presumably you are listen-
ing to at this moment (though I
am listening to Jerry Jeff Walk-
er), was recorded on 24 big
tracks with a computer and
everything. Now signed to Fron-
tier proper, THE YOUNG
FRESH FELLOWS brazenly
proclaim Totally Lost to be yet
another superlative waxing,
chockful of nourishing
goodness, melancholy madness
and the crazed bashing that fans
have come to enjoy as the trend-
setting YOUNG FRESH
FELLOWS ‘sound.’ ”’

‘‘Look for the YFF tour
caravan coming your way soon,
and the release of the entire
FELLOWS catalogue on com-
pact disc later this year.
(Although so far as we know, the
YFFs are the first band to put the
bonus track on the LP!)”’

As bizarre as they may be, the
‘*YFF caravan’’ will be pulling
into Doremus Friday night.
Make a point to get over and ex-
perience this fresh, unique group
of musicians.

The non-stop Lanin Orchestra
Center

ready

By Margaret Pimblett
Staff Reporter

 

 

The atmosphere of sophistica-
tion and savoir-faire associated
with an evening on the Orient
Express will find musical ex-
pression through the Lester
Lanin Orchestra, which will
provide entertainment in the
Warner Center throughout the
Fancy Dress ball.

Bringing 1500 of Lanin’s
trademark beanies for distribu-
tion to dancers and spectators,
the 15-piece orchestra with two
vocalists will play continuously
from 9 p.m. to | a.m.

This will be at least the second
time that the Lester Lanin Or-
chestra has performed at W&L;
the band appeared at the Dia-
mond Jubilee Fancy Dress Ball
in 1982.

Ballgoers can expect non-stop
music—Lanin orchestras _ play
without breaks, and are as likely
to play songs by Billy Joel or the
Beatles as Gershwin, Cole
Porter or Jerome Kern. Typical
big band favorites such as *‘In
the Mood’’ or *‘Just in Time”
will also be heard.

Lanin and his orchestras have
performed tor most of the
“Beautiful Peopie’’ of _ this
world—for ten presidential in-
augural bails, including George
Bush's at the Omni Shoreham
Hotel in Washington; at the
weddings of Charles and Diana
and Andrew and Sarah, Billy
Joel and Christie Brinkley. and

countless others; for debutante
balls and college dances and
even Malcolm Forbes’s parties.
The man calls his clients, not by
their first names, but by the

last—Mr. Rockefeller, Mr.
Marriot, Mr. Zappa (as in
Frank), Mr. Perot, Mr. (or

Mrs.) Trump, or Baroness de
Rothschild, and many others.

He has even made an ap-
pearance in the movies—as
himself, in a Cybill Shepherd-
Ryan O'Neil project filmed in
Washington and Los Angeles.

The tradition of the beanies
began by accident, Lanin told
The New York Times, after he
saw a man selling them on
Broadway and decided they were
a good idea. He now gives away
about 50,000 of the multicolored
cotton hats annually; High
Society partygoers are known to
remember particular events
because of particular hats.

The Lanin family name has
been associated with good music
since Lester's father, Benjamin,
was a band-leader in Philadel-
phia. Lester learned to play
drums and by age 15 was doing
gigs not only with his father, but
also with his own band in Palm
Beach. Six of Lester's eight
older brothers also headed bands
of their own.

Since then, Lanin has spent
three or four nights a week per-
forming, without a week off
since 1945. He was once mar-
ried to a former Miss Texas, but
told The New York Times that the
marriage fell apart because ‘‘she

spent more time on the road than
I did.”

Lanin’s business is more than
just leading one band on the
road. On any Saturday night, he
sends ten or fifteen orchestras
out with his name. In an inter-
view with People magazine,
Lanin said the musicians are
primarily older men.

“It's hard to find young
players who can do this,”’ he
told the magazine. ‘*You’ve got
to know three or four hundred
tunes just for openers. The kids
today, well, they learned another
way. They can read music like
nobody’s business. They can
read flyspecks. But we don’t use
music, so what good is that? You
gotta have the stuff in your
head.”’

By Lanin’s own count, he
employs 200 to 300 musicians,
and his organization mails at
least 1000 federal tax W-2 forms
each year. Unfortunately, ac-
cording to Fancy Dress Chair-
man Liz Smith, Lanin himself
will not appear at W&L—he was
already committed to directing at
a performance in Chicago on the
same night.

Letitia Baldridge, the social
secretary for Jackie Kennedy,
told People magazine, ‘‘Lester
Lanin has been, for so many of
us for so long, the one stable,
predictable guarantee of success
at any social gathering, be it a
debut in Newport or a state
dinner at the White House. ”’

- Special commemorative
champagne to be sold

 

By Jay Roget
staff reporter

 

The mood is set.
Candle Light... Soft
Music...Romance. All that is
missing is that special touch to
accent an altogether glorious
evening. You walk to the ice
bucket that you carefully
prepared that afternoon. You
reach in and _ painstakingly
remove that specially chilled bot-
tle. As you wipe the moisture
from the label, your eye catches
the personally designed label
commemorating the 82nd annual
Fancy Dress Ball.

COOK’S IMPERIAL
GRANDE RESERVE
CHAMPAGNE

This light delicate California

 
 

 

wine was especially chosen to
best epitomize the elegance of
the ball and of the Orient Ex-
press itself. After ‘‘popping‘‘
the cork and filling the flutes, the
aromatic bouquet is immediately
enjoyed by the taster. The taster
carefully examines the color and
recognizes the clarity of the
candlelight through the nectar.
Gently rotating the glass to ex-
amine the texture, one notices
the legs streaming down the
glass signifying excellence.
After the first sip, you will im-
mediately recognize a fine blend
of a California Champagne
carefully nurtured to maturity in
the award winning Napa Valley
region. Of course it is precisely
chilled to perfection at 42
degrees Fahrenheit. Your date is
impressed and comments on
your sophisticated and elegant
taste. You smile, sit back, and

Take a trip on the most gl

By Margaret Pimblett
Staff Reporter

The name of the Orient Ex-
press conjures images of
extravagance, intrigue,
romance, mystery, even a touch
of foul play. It has inspired such
authors as Agatha Christie,
Graham Greene and D.H.
Lawrence, and been the scene or
subject of at least five films, six
novels, and several stage presen-
tations. Think back to a time
when the moneyed classes had
only to dine, rest, and gaze out
the train windows at the spec-
tacular scenery passing by; to a
time when dressing for dinner
was the custom and afternoon tea
was an event. From the royalty
and celebrities who boarded it,
to the magnificence of the train
itself, the Orient Express
presents a sophisticated, elegant
theme for the 82nd Fancy Dress
Ball.

—z=—

The idea of a European ex-
press through train service was
the brainchild of Georges
Nagelmackers, a Frenchman of
a well-to-do family who
emigrated to New York after be-
ing spurned by an older women
he loved. At the time of his ar-
rival, the Pullman Delmonico
dining-car was unveiled, which
inspired Nagelmackers to con-
sider the business of passenger
travel. Upon his return to
Europe in 1868, Nagelmackers
developed a service of coaches
to run on existing tracks in
several countries, being pulled
by the engines of the railways
that owned those tracks. The
Orient Express was the first of
his international trains.

Nagelmackers’ family had
been involved in railway financ-
ing in Belgium; he presented that
country’s King Leopold II with

re

 

the proposal for a luxury train,
resulting in the king’s financial
and personal support. The
monarch’s influence among the
rulers of Europe improved
Nagelmackers’ chances of con-
vincing unwilling or skeptical
countries to participate in the
express train venture.

The first journey of the Orient
Express began at Paris’s Gare de
Strasbourg on Oct. 4, 1883, car-
rying 40 passengers bound for
Romania. Included among the
passengers were several of
Nagelmackers’s financial
backers, government officials
from France and Belgium, and
many noted journalists, some of
whom nicknamed the train ‘The
Magic Carpet to the Orient.”’

The train was, at its inaugural,
the most elegant and comfortable
means of train travel from Paris
to Istanbul. Nagelmackers envi-
sioned on a grand scale—his
train was to include every con-
ceivable facility and some not so
easily conceived. There was a
smoking room, a ladies’ boudoir
and a library. Each compartment
was a miniature drawing room
with Turkish carpets, inlaid
tables and two red plush arm-
chairs apiece, with special sleep-
ing compartments which folded
down from the  silk-covered
walls. The shower cubicles in-
cluded mosaic floors and hot and
cold running water.

Nagelmackers was particular-
ly lavish with the dining car, the
ceiling of which was covered
with embossed Spanish leather.
Tapestries hung on the walls and
Genoa velvet curtains were in
each window. Patrons found the
tables set with Baccarat crystal,
and waiters went about their
work wearing powdered wigs,
tailcoats, breeches and _ silk
stockings.

Initially, dinner was a five-

course offering cooked entirely
on board, from fresh foods
stored in a special storage cars
complete with ice-boxes. The
menu included ‘‘lobsters,
oysters, caviar, fish, game and
rich desserts,’’ according to
famed novelist Edmond About, a
passenger aboard the first trip.

 

 

 

 

About also noted that the cars
rode so smoothly that ‘‘not a
drop of champagne and wines
was spilled, and the passengers
reclined in their fauteuils as if
they were in a building firmly
rooted to the ground.”’

The term ‘‘Orient Express”’
actually came to refer to at least
three different routes, all of
which included Paris. The
original Orient Express traveled
to Constantinople by way of
Strasbourg, Stuttgart. Munich,
Linz, Vienna, Budapest,
Bucharest, and Varna, with a sea
connection to Constantinople.
Later, after 1895, the sea
journey connected at Constanta,
not Varna.

The Arlberg Orient Express
included Zurich, Innsbruck,
Salzburg (where it began to
parallel the route to Constan-
tinople), Linz, Vienna,
Budapest, Oradea, and
Bucharest, the end of the line.

The Ostend Orient Express,
with connections to central and
eastern Europe, passed through
Brussels, Frankfurt, Nurnberg

and Prague with the end of the
line being in Warsaw

The major change in routes
occurred a year afte
Nagelmackers’ death in 1905.

cars, No. 2419, was the scene of
the German surrender in 1918
and was retired from active ser-
vice.

The grandest period in Orient
Express history was the time be-
tween the wars. No longer did
passenger lists include only
royalty, nobility, and business
magnates, but now the noted
performers of Europe (singers,
actors and actresses, and con-
ductors), smugglers, spies,
writers, even Houdini and
Ziegfield Follies girls were
treated to the service of the
Orient Express. (Please see ac-
companying story On passengers
of the line on page 26.)

With the outbreak of Wo.
War II, more spying and es-
pionage took place on and
around the train. During the
war, the Simplon route was cur-
tailed, but the Germans con-
tinued a sort of train service
through Germany and eastward.
After the French defeat in 1940,
Hitler had Car 2419 hauled to
the precise spot of the German
surrender 22 years previ
receive the French surrender.

The train continued operations
after the close of the war,
although with the lowering of the
tron Curtai:
more difficult in some respects

was made

 

 

Passports and baggage were ex-
amined thoroughly at borders,
including the relatively open
ones of France and Switzerland.

The demise of the Orient Ex-
press began as early as 1961,
when French railway officials
announced that the final run
would take place May 27. In-

stead, the company continued
service; although the majority of
passengers left at Vienna, the
train ran to Bucharest. Improved
relations .with the Balkan coun-
tries resulted in resumed service
to Athens and Istanbul.

Unfortunately, by the mid-
1970’s the train’s service
reflected but a shadow of its
former grandeur. The final run
of the original Orient Express
left Paris at thirteen minutes
after midnight on May 20, 1977,
with only 18 passengers in sleep-
ing berths; the remaining
travelers took seats in the three-
day coaches taking food and
drink for the journey—no meals
were provided on the train.

The Orient Express arrived at
Serketchi Station in Istanbul on
May 22, 1977, five hours and 38
minutes behind schedule. Its
long tradition of opulent
European train travel was over.

ae

In 1977, an auction of coaches
from the original Orient Express
was held in Monte Carlo. There
were three serious bidders, in-
cluding James B. Sherwood, the
American president of the Lon-
don-based Sea Containers
Group, or SeaCo. Sherwood
purchased two of the cars, to
start a collection of 35 Pullmans
and Wagons-Lits, and had them
extensively restored to their
period opulence by expert craft-
smen throughout Europe. The
five- year restoration cost a re-
ported $20 million; the projects
included hand-set mosaics on
bathroom floors, lamps of Lali-
que glass and mahogany toilet
seats.

The reborn Venice-Simplon
Orient Express started its first
trip on May 25, 1982, nearly
100 years after the first Orient
Express pulled out of Paris’s

Gare de Strasbourg. The 17-car
train of the 1980's journey
traveled from Paris to Venice.

Among the train’s cars are
three restaurant cars, one bar
car, two crew cars, and 11
wagons-lits. Together, they
make up the longest passenger:
train in all Europe (400 meters).

In the company’s first eight
months of service, more than
20,000 passengers embarked for
points east. The train’s capacity
for each of its twice-weekly
departures is 194 travelers; it
needs a 70 percent capacity to
turn a profit. Fares for 1989
range from a low of $245 for a
day car from Zurich to Inn-
sbruck or Innsbruck to Venice,
to a high of $1300 for a south-
bound trip, London to Venice, in
the peak season. The full-length
trip takes about 30 hours, in-
cluding one overnight stay.

This version of the Orient Ex-
press continues the fine stan-
€Gf0s set By the
original—exquisite furnishings,
delectable dining, impeccable
service and a bar that doesn’t
close until the last patron calls it
a night. There are a few com-
plaints—the incessant rocking of
the coaches, the three- hour
dinners (how else to enjoy a
multi-course meal?), the place-
ment of only one bathroom per
carriage.

One American passenger
summed up the difficulties suc-
cinctly: *‘You take the Orient
Express to go back in time, and
that inevitably leads to some in-
conveniences."

Sherwood, the man whose
dream resurrected the Venice-
Simplon Orient Express, puts it
another way: “‘To board this
train,’ he says, ‘‘should be an
event. We're not selling
transportation. ””

Live Drive, an organization
which provides rides to and from
W&L functions, will be pro-
viding its services for the Fancy
Dress weekend.

Live Drive was first conceived
in the spring of 1988. Sopho-
more class EC representative
John Fialcowitz was instrumen-
tal in its founding as well as
sophomores Chris Bray and
Rodd Maloy and senior Benny
Savage. Live Drive was begun
partly because of the large
number of drinking and driving
incidences among W&L
students. The members of Live
Drive worked to establish a safe
ride program for the university.

The first major function that

Live Drive was active in was
Homecoming. Since then, Live
Drive has been available at
Christmas weekend, the Con-
nells concert and various frater-
nity parties. Live Drive has been
very active and successful. Ac-
cording to Fialcowitz, ‘‘this year
has been a good year. The Ad-

ministration and the student
body have really responded
well.’’

For Fancy Dress weekend,
Live Drive will be providing
rides on Thursday night and on
Saturday night. The possibility
of having the vans available for
the ball on Friday night was con-
sidered. However, due to the
fact that the ball is held in close
proximity to the dorms and
fraternity houses, the officers of
Live Drive decided that van ser-

Instead, Live Drive is

Live Drive will be providing
rides to and from Thursday
night’s concert and the vans will
be running up to the pavilion.
There will also be stops at the
Baker-Davis-Gilliam quad and at
all of the fraternity houses.

For Saturday's fraternity par-
ties, Live Drive is providing
rides on a request basis accor-
ding to Fialcowitz. Each frater-
nity will make a request to Live
Drive if they wish to have the
vans available for their parties
and according to Fialcowitz
there is no set route for Saturday
night.

Live Drive is in the process of
establishing a call-in service in
which a student could call a cer-
tain number and a member of
Live Drive would pick up that
student and give him a ride
home. Fialcowitz said that this
service should be implemented
this year.

Fialcowitz expressed an em-
phasis on ‘‘preventive
measures’ for the entire week-
end. The members of Live Drive
encourage students to walk to
and from Fancy Dress functions
and expressed that if driving is
necessary during the weekend,
students should be sure to
designate a sober driver.

The Reivers bring new sound to Doremus

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

Friday night is the big night.
The Warner Center will be dec
orated from top to bottom with
Lester Lanin providing the big
band swing to make everyones
toes tap and feet dance. But how
about those that don’t enjoy big
band music or those who just
want to be-bop back and forth
between big band and _ rock.
Don’t worry, you're not
forgotten.

Starting sometime after 9 p.m.
the intellectual rock and roll
band The Reivers will start off
the rock side of the ball with the
Young Fresh Fellows following.
Sounding a little like a cross be-
tween The Outfield and 10,000
Maniacs, The Reivers combine
poetically pleasant lyrics with a
biting musical score that com-
bines for a fulfilling experience.
Intellectual, though? Perhaps
lead guitarist, singer and pro-
ducer John Croslin can best ex-
plain.

‘*We've been fairly well
received critically, but some
critics have pointed out that
we're a little bit intellectual. I'm
a real fan of William Faulkner,
[the band took its name from the
Faulkner novel of the same
name] and yes, that’s one for
needing Cliff Notes; but I want
people to understand and be
touched by the music without
knowing about Shakespeare or

consulting Cliff Notes, and |
think a lot of people
misunderstood that. Rock ‘n’
roll is considered emotional, not
intellectual, I enjoy bringing the
two together.”

The Reivers origin begins with
a band called Zeitgeist that the
four members of the band,
Croslin, singer and rhythm
guitarist Kim Longacre, bassist
Cindy Toth and drummer Gar-
rett Williams, formed at the
University of Texas between
1983 and 1985. A few months
later Zeitgeist put together a 3-
song EP that won great response
from the local crowds as well as
critical raves nationally.

In 1986, DB Records based in
Atlanta signed Zeitgeist and
released Translate Slowly which
Croslin produced. About this
time, however, a New Age band
from Minnesota, also called
Zeitgeist forced the band to
change its name and thus, The
Reivers were born.

Later in 1986 The Reivers
signed a contract with Capitol
records and relea Saturday in
late 1987, Then in March of
1988, the band was named Best
New Music Band for the fourth
year in a row by the Austin
Chronicle and was named Band
of the Year. The Reivers come
to W&L having released their
third album End of the Day just
over a month ago.

The Reivers will bring their fresh sound to Doremus Friday night.

The Reivers are coming on in
the music world and don’t let
anyone tell you differently.
Longacre attributes it to the be-
ing in the right place at the right
time and a lot of hard work.

““We formed at a unique time
in the Austin music scene. No
one was expecting any record
deals or any real attention to be
paid to us. We formed a band —
and played a lot of parties. Then
we wondered if we could get a
show. We got shows, and that

was cool, and then we said,
‘Let’s make a single...if there’s
one thing we want to take away
from this band it’s a single.” So
we made a single. Then we said,
*Wouldn’t it be a hoot if we went
on tour.’ It kind of snowballed.
When we ran into Danny Beard,
who owned DB Records, he lik-
ed us and signed us.”’

As good and bad as life has
been for the Reivers so far,
however, they know they have a
long, but promising road ahead

of them.

**{It hasn’t been] a struggle; it
was more, ‘Let’s see what
happens,’’’ Longacre com-
mented. ‘*‘Of course, we’ve had
major frustrations — getting all
the way to New York City to
tour and the car breaking down,
sleeping on floors, and having to
ask for so much time off of your
day job. Five years has gone by
quickly, but I can see so much
more potential in the band. It’s
all been worth it.’’

Twenty Questions and Answers with |
Fancy Dress Chairman Liz Smith

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

1. How did you get to the
Chairman of Fancy Dress?

After being the assistant
chairman for last year’s ball, I
applied for this year’s chairman
position. I was interviewed by
the Executive Committee who
selects all of the members of the
SAB Board of Directors, and
was chosen at the beginning of
Spring Term last year.

2.What are your actual
responsibilities as Fancy Dress
Chairman?

As a member of the SAB
Board of Directors I work to
help provide entertainment and
activities for the student body.
My major responsibility, of
course, is the organization of the
Friday Ball including managing
the budget, ordering supplies
and decorations and  coor-
dinating the work schedule.
Many people play major roles in
the whole process, but I guess
I’m the one that cracks the whip
to make sure it all gets done.

3. How much money is being
spent on this year’s ball?

The cost of this year’s ball
comes close to $100,000 in-
cluding Thursday night enter-
tainment. My budget for the ball
alone is around $85,000.

into this year’s ball?

The SAB members-at-large
and the Fancy Dress Steering
Committee each work 20 hours.
Specific committee chairmen
will work more than that along
with the board members. In all,
we have around 100 people actu-
ally doing the hands-on prep-
aration.

5. How difficult was it to get
the bands hired for Fancy
Dress?

Every year there are problems
with hiring bands for Fancy
Dress. This happens because the
beginning of March is a time that
is not normally used for touring
by big-name acts. They usually
wait until April to start the
spring tour schedule. This being
the case, you have to offer ex-
treme prices to bring the bands
out and most of the time, they
use the winter months to cut new
albums or ‘‘rest’’ and won’t
come out for an isolated date.
It’s very frustrating when you
have the money to spend and
acts won't accept offers.

6. Why won’t they accept
offers?

I guess they view W&L as a
small audience and one that
won't help them much as far as
record sales or other promotions
go. They feel it’s not worth their
while to come to a closed private
event like Fancy Dress for the
same price they could get at a
bigger school or another con-
cert.

7. Was it especially hard to
get Lester Lanin?

No. Lester Lanin approached
me to book the Fancy Dress date
back in October. He loves to
play at W&L and we were lucky
enough to book his orchestra for
Friday. He can’t come himself
because of a prior engagement.
(Lester Lanin has around 15 or-
chestras that he dispatched to
different events.) He stays busy
most of the year and travels ex-
tensively.

8. What will be different
about this year’s ball?

This year we have incor-
porated more direct impact from
committee members. There are

16 committee chairmen who
have worked very hard to de-
velop the details of the Ball dec-
orations and assumed leadership
positions in the production. The
Ball will have a _ very
sophisticated and glitzy am-
biance that should make for a
very special evening.

9. How did you come up with
the theme?

Suggestions were tossed
around among the board and
members and then a final list was
compiled and voted on. The two
vote getters were ‘‘Orient Ex-
press’ and ‘‘Roaring 20s’’ cap-
turing 57 percent of the vote. We
decided that since the heyday of
the Orient Express was in the
20s, the two themes could be
easily incorporated to create this
year’s theme.

10. Who came up with the
decoration ideas?

The overall concepts were de-
veloped by my assistant, Tim
Ward, and myself with the aid of
literature from the actual Orient
Express network. Then the
committee chairmen took those
basic guidelines and worked out
the specific details and sketches.

11. Where does the money
for the ball come from?

Fancy Dress is its own busi-
ness. What we spend we have to
get back in ticket and
memorabilia sales. It takes a
tremendous amount of careful
budgeting to make sure the
numbers work out the way they
should so that Fancy Dress pays
for itself.

12. What is the most exciting
thing about this year’s ball?

We have a 40 by 10 foot rep-
lica of the Bar-Salon Car of the
actual Orient Express train that
we have acquired and shipped
here to Lexington to be the focal
point of the 500 level balcony.

13. How did you find out
about the Bar-Salon Car?

Tim Ward knew about it from
a benefit ball that used the Orient
Express theme in Tampa,
Florida. He coordinated our
purchase of it and facilitated its
arrival here at the ball.

Fancy Dress chairman Liz Smith answers 20 Fancy Dress questions.

preliminary organization since
September. The theme was
finalized before Christmas and
all of the specific planning began
in January. The Ball takes about
six to eight months to plan and
organize.

16. Will we be having a
fireworks display this year?

Yes, we will again have a
large fireworks show to close the
ball at around | a.m.. We will
also have two searchlights which
we’ve brought back for this year
due to student request.

17. Where will everything be
located at the ball?

We have basically stuck to the
same layout that we have had in
the past. Lester Lanin will play
in the Warner Center and the
Reivers and Young Fresh
Fellows will play in Doremus.

18. What’s been the hardest
thing about managing Fancy
Dress?

Definitely coordinating all of
the people with the jobs that
need to be done. Because of the
extensive construction this year,
it has been difficult to plan
building in pieces since we can’t
move into the gym until Tuesday
evening.

19. What is the alcohol pol-
icy this year?

There will be no beer garden
this year. Getting an ABC
license is very difficult for any
W&L function and we decided
that it would be better to not
have a license and therefore not
have ABC agents at the ball than
have a license and agents there
to arrest underage drinkers. It
just isn’t worth the hassle. I have
no doubt that everyone will en-
Joy themselves with or without
beer.

20. What’s the one thing you
want the W&L community to
know about this year’s Fancy
Dress Ball?

Fancy Dress is a long-standing
tradition which a large portion of
the university takes part in.
Many people in every area of
our campus have had a hand in
the final product you will be a
part of on Friday evening.

Take the time to read the
background information on the
theme and the era which will
make all that you see more
meaningful. Fancy Dress is for
you to enjoy- those who have
worked have done so to make
your weekend one that you will
remember. Please take the time
to thank your friends for their
efforts. I wish there was space
for me to express my apprecia-
tion to all who made Tim’s and
my endeavor achievable. I'll
delegate that job to you. Enjoy
your weekend.

this season in this state, whieh is
noted for the beauty of its social

“George” and “Mary Washing.

“Caso” tothe “Virginian,” from
“Tiawatha’’ to Whig Dodo,”
from “Morning” to “Night.”
These costumes were furnished by

W&L alumnus creates

 

By Margaret Pimblett
Staff Reporter

 

The graphic artist responsible
for this year’s Fancy Dress T-
shirts, cups and other souvenirs
is a 1980 W&L alumnus, Bruce
Whipple.

After majoring in European
history and economics at W&L,
Whipple continued his education
at North Carolina State,
graduating in 1986 with a
master’s degree in product

design and a graphic design op-
tion.

He is currently the marketing
and business development
manager for Hanbury Evans
Newill Vlattas & Company of
Norfolk.

Whipple also worked for two
years as marketing director for
Marcellus Wright Cox and
Smith Architects of Richmond.
That company designed the
W&L University Library, Lewis
Hall, Gaines Hall, and the
Lenfest Center for the Perform-
ing Arts, and planned the reno-

_ design for Fancy Dress

vations of the Commerce
School, parts of Tucker Hall,
and Graham-Lees Dormitory,
among other campus projects.

As a student at North Carolina
State, Whipple was the business
and design editor of Urban
Design in Action, a book pub-
lished with the American In-
stitute of Architects.

He has also done design work
for the Historic Preservation
Foundation of North Carolina,
Henry Dreyfuss Associates of
New York, and Public Televi-
sion for North Carolina.

Your culinary guide to FD

By Jason Faust
Alumni Staff Reporter

 

Fancy Dress, one of the
nation’s largest parties, a time
for great bands and people, is
also the right time to go out and
enjoy a good meal with a date.
or, for those who dare venture to
Fancy Dress without a date,
good friends.

Towards this end, the
southwest region of Virginia can
more than adequately cater to
such dining needs. Tucked away
in Charlottesville, Staunton,
Lexington, Lynchburg and
Roanoke: are some great dining
establishments.

In this article I have tried to
put together a list of some of
these places with a brief descrip-
tion and essential details for
each. I can not claim to have
eaten at all the restaurants listed,
but they all have good reputa-
tions or have otherwise been
recommended to me. In most
cases, a Call to the maitre d’ was
necessary.

At this point, I must admit that
after re-reading the descriptions,
this may not be a fair article. The
descriptions may appear that I
am trying to head you to a par-
ticular restaurant.

I must admit also that I do
have a personal favorite, The
White Star Mill, but please don’t
let the sound or size of a descrip-
tion discourage you— I don’t
think you can go wrong with any
of them.

In any case, whether you
choose a restaurant from this or
dine at your own favorite, eat
well and with a group of friends
for ‘‘good dining company
makes for better dining’’—
wherever. And please, don’t
ruin the weekend for your family

and friends by overindulging and
driving. Obey the rules of the
road and use common sense. I
hope this list proves helpful in
making your Fancy Dress
Weekend successful.

BON APPETIT.

Charlottesville

The Boar’s Head Inn, Route
250 W., 2 miles off Route 29,
804-276-2131.

Located in a posh region of
Albemarle County, the Boar's
Head Inn serves as both an inn
and a restaurant. Though the
menu lacks international flare
they do serve duck. The glory of
the Boar’s Inn is solid American
cuisine prepared impeccably.
Prices of entrees range from
$12.25 to $18. A full bar with a
good selection of wines will ac-
company a meal nicely. Reserva-
tions and jackets for men are re-
quired.

The Ivy Inn, 2244 Old Ivy
Road (across from Ivy gardens

— one mile from University of

Virginia), 804-977-1222.

Dine by candlelight in this
restored large house, built circa
1803. The menu at the Ivy Inn
varies greatly, including
chicken, beef, veal and lamb.
Prices range from $10.50 to
$14.00. Despite the romantic
atmosphere, Mrs. Abbot, the
proprietor, permits a ‘‘just be
comfortable’ style of dress, but
she would appreciate reserva-
tions. All spirits are served.

The C&O Restaurant, 515 E.
Water, 804-971-7044.

This may be one of Char-
lottesville’s, and southwest
Virginia’s, most enjoyable and
unique restaurants. At the C&O

Restaurant, the emphasis of the
dining experience is on the food
(‘‘the focus of the senses’’) and
as such the formal dining room
(coat and tie required) is dec-
orated all white —white linens,
white walls, white floors. The
French cuisine is serve a la carte
but unlike European restaurants
the portions are large. Don’t
pass up the opportunity to enjoy
your meal with a bottle of wine
from the C&O’s extensive wine
cellar which has been voted one
of the top 100 in the nation by
Wine Spectator magazine. En-
tree prices range from $18.25 to
$25. Bill Hubert, the manager,
says that the experience is
unique but honestly admits that
you may love it or hate it. There
are two seatings for dinner, the
first at 6:30 and the second at
9:30 p.m..

L

Emil’s, Boonsboro Shopping
Center, Route 501 North, 804-
384-3311.

Don’t let Emil’s location fool
you or deter you— this place is
wonderful— probably as many
Sweet Briar girls can attest.
Emil’s serves lunch and dinner
in its two dining rooms. The
menu is varied and enticing. Li-
quor, beer and wine are served.
Dinner prices of entrees start at
around $8, the average being
about $12. Dress for dinner is
semi-formal to formal and reser-
vations are recommended.

Sachiko’s International Res-
taurant, 126 Old Grave Mill
Road, 804-237-5655.

Beef, seafood, veal, lamb and
chicken dishes all prepared in a

great variety of international
styles will certainly satisfy a
number of different tastes.
Prices range from $9.50 to
$21.95 and a full complement of
spirits will help carry the even-
ing. Sachiko’s is an elegant res-
taurant and requires coat and tie
as well as reservations.

The Bank, 1030 Main St. (11th
and Main), 804-847-8100.

The structural beauty of ine
Bank will enhance a meal of
authentic French cuisine.
Originally built in 1914 as a
bank, the owner of the restaurant
has since spent over one million
dollars converting the building
into a three-story restaurant. The
third floor serves as a formal
dining room complete with
fireplace and 40-foot ceilings ac-
centuated with decorative gold
leaf. Meals are made-to-order
and the menu may vary
somewhat according to
deliveries made four times week-
ly. Prices are very reasonable
starting at $8.50. The owner and
chef assure that you will never
feel out of place in black tie for
many patrons are fully decked
out. Though reservations are
suggested a week in advance, it
would behoove you to call

anyway.

Roanoke

The Library, 3117 Franklin
Road {in Piccadilly Square),
985-0811

The Library is a beautiful,
quaint French restaurant with
more than excellent atmosphere.
The service is perfect as is the
extensive menu complete with

seafood, beef, lamb and veal
dishes that will delight the palate
of even the pickiest eaters. If you
can stand it, leave room for the
dessert cart which will both
amaze and delight. Entrees will
run anywhere from $17.95 to
$21.95. The Library is possibly
the finest restaurant in Roanoke,
and definitely one of the finest in
the state a la Virginia: A History
and Guide.

La Maison,
Road, 366-2444.

The elegance of La Maison is
evident even before you enter
the front door. Once a Georgian
mansion, the beautiful structure
now contains 15 dining rooms in
which delicious French cuisine
is served. French veal and lamb
are generally the order of the day
but American fare of beef and
seafood are also served. Entrees
run generally between $7 and
$18 with $11 as the average.
Dress is optional but a coat and
tie are recommended. Dinner is
served Monday through Satur-
day from 4:30 to 11:00 p.m..
Reservations are recommended
when dining on Saturday.

5732 Airport

Fesquet Upper level—
Crossroads Mall, 362-8803.

Fesquet is a casual restaurant
located just 10 minutes from
Hollins College. In a cozy at-
mosphere you can dine on
French cuisine or seafood.

Lexington

The Wilson-Walker House, 30
N. Main St. , 463-3020.

The Wilso.-Walker House is
similar to old inn dining. There
are several rooms which add to
its coziness and eliminates much
of the hustle and bustle of large
one-room restaurants. Cocktails,
beer and wine will complement
your meal. The menu is strong
with beef, seafood and chicken
dishes. Entrees are prepared a
variety of different ways, in-
cluding Southern American. The
location is a plus and conve-
nience in choosing the restaurant
for it is walking distance from
most parts of town. Prices range
from around $8 to about $15.
Reservations are a must during
Fancy Dress and coat and tie are
recommended.

Maple Hall, Route 11 and 81,
Lexington, 463- 4666.
Maple Hall is a beautiful large

country home converted into a
restaurant. There are several
small dining rooms decorated in
impeccable colonial taste. Maple
Hall does have a private room
reserved for larger parties. The
menu will vary from day to day
but a patron can always count on
high quality service and fine
country dining. Again the con-
venience of dining in the Lex-
ington area is obvious. Reserva-
tions are appreciated and coat
and tie is recommended.

Hunan Garden, East Nelson
Street, Lexington. 463-3330.

This, Lexington’s only
Chinese restaurant (and the only
Oriental restaurant since the
demise three years ago of the
legendary Aloha Wok) opened in
April last year. Students have
varying opinions of the estab-
lishment—some think it offers
respectable Chinese cuisine (par-

ticularly taking into account the
fact that it is located in the heart
of the Shenandoah Valley),
while others have been
dissatisfied with the service
and/or food. Chances are you’ ve
got your own opinion already.

Staunton

Buckhorn Inn, 12 miles west of
Staunton, Route 250 W.
Churchville, 337-6900.

The Buckhorn Inn is a very
casual restaurant serving an
$11.50 seafood buffet on Friday.
Enjoy beer, wine and a lot to eat
between the hours of 4:00 and
9:00. Reservations are not
necessary but you may want to
call ahead to be sure.

The White Star Mill, 1 Mill
St., 885-3409.

Truly one of the finer estab-
lishments around. The White
Star Mill is not cheap but is

Fancy Dress Supplement, February 23, 1989, Page 23

definitely worth it for the
tremendous variety of dishes.
Appetizers range from escargot
to a variety of soups. Desserts
are a la carte and plentiful but
the entrees are the bill of the
day. Pasta, beef, all types of
seafood, and Cajun dishes are
prepared to impeccable detail
and taste. An evening at the
White Star Mill for two, in-
cluding a few indulgences into
the full bar, will run around $80
to $100 but, oh boy, it’s well
worth the expense if you can af-
ford it.

The Belle Grae Inn, 515 W.
Frederick St. (Downtown), 886-
5151.

The Bell Grae Inn has a bistro
serving an a la carte menu and a
dining room located in the old
inn. Dinner varies from night to
night according to the chef's
choices. Each night there is a
choice of three different meals
which include appetizer, soup,

entree and dessert for the set
price of $20. A full bar will add
an additional price per drink.
Dress is optional and reserva-
tions are not required though it
may be well advised to call
ahead to check on the crowd and
menu.

(Note: This article was original-
ly printed in last year’s Fancy
Dress Supplement. Prices may
have changed since that time and
those interested in eating at any
of these establishments are urged
to call and check current prices.)

On FD,

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

Many of you might be wonder-
ing what the sports editor of this
highly respectable newspaper is
doing talking (commenting,
analyzing?) on Fancy ‘‘I have
absolutely nothing to do with
sweat socks and Nike hightops’’
Dress. It’s not that I’m the staff
social critic or anything for The
Phi. So why me? What qualifica-
tions could I possibly have?
Well, none. But that didn’t stop
Dan Quayle from running for
Vice President and look what
happened to him. Anyway,
sports are entertainment and FD
is certainly entertaining in some
peculiar sort of way, so that
justifies the sports writer in giv-
ing a new perspective on this
major social event of the school
year. Okay, I’m stretching a bit,
but hey, somebody has got to
make some sense out of it all
(and Mr. Tuggle wouldn’t give
me the Senior Perspective posi-
tion).

I liken the FD experience to a
game I played when I was young
— flashlight tag. It was sort of
the nighttime version of hide and
seek but the boundaries were
more confined and you had that
big 10-volt Radio Shack

 

flashlights and playing games

spotlight that, if you weren’t
careful, would blind the dog or
burn a hole in somebody’s pants
pockets. The object was for your
friends to hide in trees, under
cars or behind bushes and the
person who was “‘it’’ would
‘‘catch’’ you using the
flashlight. The problem was
never one of location but of iden-
tification. We used to change
clothes —T-shirts, shorts and
sneakers — to make it even more
of a challenge. Appearance and
reality diverged. What you
thought you. saw and what was
actually true did not always
coincide. Great game, huh?

Well, FD is a lot like
flashlight tag. The person in
need of a date is ‘‘it.’’ The
“‘game’’ is played at night
(although daytime competition is
allowed. And the players are
constantly changing appearances
(we all know about girls and
their friends when it comes to
borrowing clothes). The idea is
to “‘catch’’ someone; namely,
the perfect date. The only
differences are girls are allowed
to play in this game and every-
one who hasn’t secured a date
yet is ‘‘it.”’ And that is where the
game begins, for who really
doesn’t want to go to FD?

Like most games, there are
winners and losers. But just get-
ting a date does not mean you
have won the game, nor is the
converse true. Winning and los-
ing is not based on finding a
date, but rather on identifying
the good ones from the bad ones.
I think everyone is tired of hear-
ing about the ‘‘perfect’’ date that
ended up in disaster. I have no
sympathy. You blew it by choos-
ing that person in the first place.
To have a good time you have to
be good at the game, and to be
good at the game you must know
the rules. So........

Rule No. 1—Never ever ask a
person while under the influence
of alcohol. Reasons are self-
explanatory. However, entrap-
ment is allowed. So if the
homecoming queen gets a little
tipsy one Friday night, go for it
(and get her to pledge on her
honor — several witnesses
would be key here.

Rule No. 2—If it’s someone
you have just met, play it cheap.
No sense in blowing $200 on a
person that you may or may not
have fun with. If it’s someone
you love.... play it cheap. If
you’re in love you don’t have to
impress her/him. So I guess the

operative word for the weekend
is “‘cheap.”’

Rule No. 3—Don’t ask
anyone the week of FD. Des-
perateness has a way of clouding
your judgment especially when
combined with judgment-
clouding substances (see Rule
No. 1). If you don’t discover
anyone worthy of spending the
weekend with you, don’t worry
(be happy). It’s not like less than
SO percent of the W&L popula-
tion doesn’t have a good time,
anyway.

Rule No. 4—Always find out
a person’s intentions before giv-
ing out the bid. Example: If a
girl asks ‘‘Who is playing at
your house on Saturday night?”’
before you ask her, forget it. If
she says something like ‘White
Star Mills is my favorite restau-
rant,’’ ask her if she wants to go
there for dinner and then tell her
to have a good time. See? And
who said this game couldn’t be
fun?

Rule No. 5—Keep the number
of couples in a group to four or
less. There is nothing worse than
being held up by other people’s
lateness. That is, unless your
best friend’s date happens to take

 

off her dress and start dancing
on the bar at the cocktail party.
But these things only happen on
rare occasions.

And there you have it. Rules
or guidelines that will ensure
you of success in your quest for
the best time at Fancy Dress
(my, that was almost poetic).
And remember, its not the Ball
that brings the most excitement,
but rather the game of FD Tag
that precedes it all. By the way,
has anyone seen my flashlight?

Famous passengers of the Express

 

By Margaret Pimblett
Staff Reporter

 

The Orient Express has hosted scores of world-famous people,
including royalty, performers of all kinds, spies and wealthy
business owners. Here is a short listing of some of the more
colorful personalities who have ridden the Orient Express.

Isadore Duncan — The dancer gave ‘‘unconventional’’ per-
formances on board train—including her trips to the shower.
One conductor remembered that she pranced from her com-
partment clad in ‘‘much less than a veil—rather, something in
the size of a handkerchief, and in the wrong place, too.”’

Harry Houdini — Magician and escape artist extraor-
dinaire, Houdini was one of the most frequent passengers and
occasionally gave performances on board.

Arturo Toscanini — Later the conductor of the NBC Or-
chestra, he often traveled with his family. Roger Commault,
an Orient Express staff member, was changing records on the
hand-operated gramophone in one of the restaurant cars when
he saw Toscanini and began searching for a few Verdi and
Bizet opera recordings; the maestro congratulated him on his
musical taste.

King Boris of Bulgaria — The ruler was a railway buff who
insisted on taking the train's controls while traveling through
his own country. Since his will was sovereign within his
borders, the engineer had to allow him; by all accounts, he was
a capable driver.

Mata Hari — ‘*The Most Dangerous Woman Spy’’ escaped
an unhappy marriage to an alcoholic by going to Paris and
becoming a courtesan and the first nude dancer in that city. She
was executed in 1917, partially because of her friendship with
a German diplomat.

Maharajah of Cooch Behar — The ruler of a small land in
northeast India brought his seven wives and concubines and 29
servants on his trip to London for the imperial conference in
1907,

Edward VIII — While still Prince of Wales (before his
reign and abdication), Edward insisted on having a grilled
kipper for breakfast. None were on board (being regarded as a
lower class dish), so the enterprising chef found some smoked
trout, sliced it and grilled it. The prince was completely
satisfied with his meal.

Sidney Poitier — The American actor, the first black man to
win an Academy Award, brought 30 pieces of luggage for his
travel on the restored Venice-Simplon Orient Express.

A special Thanks -

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

The Fancy Dress Ball is a glo-
rious tradition at Washington
and Lee and has been cherished
as ‘‘the best time of the year’’
almost since its inception in
1907. Miss Annie Jo White must
laugh when she looks down and
sees what a big deal her little get-
together has become.

There is an undeniable magic
that accompanies Fancy Dress.
Everyone seems happier and
more “‘laid back’’ to coin a
phrase from my part of the coun-
try. Perhaps it is the anticipation
of having just the right date, or
that entire weekend, day and
night with someone who is really
special. Maybe it’s the prospect
of dropping out of reality for
four days and nights with
nothing to worry about but
eating, drinking, laughing and
enjoying yourself. Whatever the
cause for elation, it is justified
and good.

This year’s Fancy Dress, An
Evening Excursion on the Orient
Express will be the fruit of many
people’s labor and as Liz Smith
points out in her question and
answer article, please take the
time to thank the people who
made this year’s ball possible.
These people have just as much
to do as the rest of us, but for
two weeks they make the

' sacrifices and do the work and

make Fancy Dress, your Fancy
Dress a reality.

As you come to the end of this
year’s special FD supplement, I
hope you have both enjoyed your
reading and gotten something
from it. Like the Ball itself, this
supplement is the fruit of many
people’s labors and a project that
has taken countless hours to put
together. It is all worth it,
however, if you the reader
benefit from our work.

As the Entertainment Editor
for the past two years, I feel the
most worthwhile thing I have
done was putting together the
past two Fancy Dress Sup-
plements. I can only hope that
when I am gone that the tradition
we have started, will continue to
exist.

Before concluding, there are
some people that I would like to
thank for their help in making
this supplement possible.

THANKS:

-to Margaret Pimblett without
whose tireless help and research
this would never have gotten to
press.

-to Betsy Parkins and Pam
Kelley for their help in laying
out the biggest project we have
ever taken on.

_ to Liz Smith for all her help and

cooperation in getting the infor-
mation necessary to put this
together. I can only hope that the

articles in the supplement have
done her enough justice as the
Chairman. She has put together
the best Fancy Dress that cer-
tainly any of us have seen and
should be thanked and appreci-
ated by you all.

-to all the writers who wrote
what are well-written, quality ar-
ticles for the supplement.

-to Beth Freund and Chery! Bar-
rett who stayed up all hours of
the day and night taking and de-
veloping pictures that I needed
for my layout.

-to Gay Lea and Cheryl, the
women in the darkroom and Jim
at the The News Gazette for
their endless help.

-and to you, the Washington and
Lee community, whose interest
inspires us to put out things like
the Fancy Dress supplement.

And finally, though it has been
said over and over again it won't
hurt to say it one more time.
Please don’t drink and drive this
weekend. You know the police
will be out, you know ABC
agents will probably be in the
area since they usually are for
big events like Fancy Dress and
you know what the conse-
quences are for DUI. It’s just not
worth the risk. Please, don’t ruin
your weekend and your life.
Have a safe and a happy Fancy
Dress and enjoy the Supplement.

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

Big 3 results in;

Finkelstein and Dumas win

this inventory would eliminate dis-
crepancies from year to year.

 

ugh Finkelstein and Willard
Dumas were elected as president
and vice-president, respectively, of
W&L’s Executive Committee on
Monday, by a 67 percent turnout
among students.

Finkelstein, a second-year law
student from Pocono Lake, Pa.,
defeated Chris Giblin, a junior from
Washington, D.C. Dumas, a so-
phomore from New Orleans, La.,
defeated Jud Parker, a junior from
Tampa, Fla. All of the candidates
were pleased with the voter turnout
despite the rainy weather and tim-
ing of the election after Fancy Dress
weekend.

Finkelstein stressed that he will
work to enforce three main goals as
the president of the student body;
“‘T want to eliminate the ‘oral tra-
dition’ of simply handing down,
from year to year, a committee's
procedures and guidelines. Now we
want to avoid inefficiency and base
decisions on what is written
down.”’ He gave the example of
each student body committee keep-
ing an inventory of its equipment;

“Self-study committees of the
university are currently questioning
the students’ responsibility to allo-
cate funds of nearly $190,000 if
Students aren’t reliable enough to
account for what happens from year
to year,’’ Finkelstein said.

As his second goal, he said he
thought the student body needs to
be better educated about student
government. ‘‘Right now it’s a situ-
ation of alphabet soup; people
aren't sure how the EC, IFC [Inter-
fraternity Council], CRC [Confi-
dential Review Committee], SCC
{Student Conduct Committee] all
work, These groups need to better

define themselves, and convey
that.”
Thirdly, Finkelstein said he

would like to see fairness and a
greater diversity in certain commit-
tee appointments. ‘‘Nothing is au-
tomatic. We’re going to look for
who’s going to improve committees
with experience and new ideas.”’
One of Dumas’ main points as
well, he said, is the need for ‘‘more
fairness in these appointments.”’
Dumas cited in his speech last week

 

Robert Black- An “‘insider’s view’’ to the ‘‘Making of Monetary

Policy”

Black talks

about

monetary policy

By Tina Vandersteel
Staff Reporter

 

The most fascinating part of mak-
ing federal monetary policy is the
human element involved, Rich-
mond’s Federal Reserve Bank
President Robert Black said Mon-
day night in Lee Chapel.

Black, who spoke to about 100
people on ‘‘The Making of the
Monetary Policy’’ described what
he called the ‘‘insider’s view’’ of
how monetary policy is formed.
The speech was sponsored by the
University Lectures Committee and
the Commerce School. Black is a
member of the Federal Open Mar-
ket Committee, the key body for
deciding monetary policy in the
U.S. economy. He described how
the committee arrived at a decision
two weeks ago to recommend a
tightening of the money supply.

The FOMC consists of 12 mem-
bers: the seven members of the
Federal Reserve Board of Gov-
emors, the president of the New
York Federal Reserve Bank, and
four members who rotate among the
remaining 11 district bank presi-
dents.

Black said the committee meets
eight times a year, and the commit-
tee’s recommendations determine
actions generally attributed to the
Federal Reserve Board and _ its
president, Alan Greenspan.

‘*All 12 district bank presidents
attend [FOMC meetings] whether
they are voting or not,”’ he said.
‘because we always have the
power to sway opinions.”’

Speaking in terms of his experi-
ence as Richmond’s bank president,
Black said preparation for FOMC
meetings comes in two forms: in-
formal and formal. Informal prep-
aration goes on ail the time, he said.
and it includes keeping up to date
with all publications of economic
indicators.

Formal preparation, Black said.
begins two weeks prior to the meet-
ing with the release of the “‘Beige
Book,”’ which he described as a
grass-roots update of economic in-
dicators.

A few days before the meeting,
Black said, he has usually prepared
a tentative position for the meeting.

“Then comes the Blue Book,”’
Black said, joking that a color-blind
person would never make it in the
Federal Reserve System. He said
this book lists the alternatives the
Fed can consider, including expand-
ing, contracting or not changing the
money supply.

The FOMC meetings themselves,
Black said, ‘‘are pretty much what
you would expect. They start at 9
a.m., and people start talking faster
and agreeing with others more
readily as lunch hour approaches.

“You will find people piggy-
backing on others’ statements more
often come 1 p.m., ”’ Black joked.

And with 19 people evaluating
the state of the economy, he contin-
ued, ‘‘even using the same statistics
doesn’t help.”’

Black said the meeting finishes
when a directive has been drafted.
The last meeting, Black continued,
offered a very reserved suggestion
that the Fed increase existing re-
straints on the money supply.

‘*The caveats attached to the rec-
ommendation are the most impor-
tant part,’ Black said. First on the
list was a reminder to the Fed to
watch the rate of inflation, the stabi-
lization of which is currently the
Fed’s main goal.

After that, he said, ‘‘things we
wanted the Fed to take into account
were: the strength of the business
expansion, behavior of monetary
aggregates and developments ir
foreign exchange.”

The FOMC’s decision, Black
said, is ‘‘not perfect,’’ but it does
‘‘bring together the wisdom of all
19 people and their staff into a well-
informed decision about what ought
to be done about the monetary po-
licy.”

In response to the FOMC’s rec-
ommendations, on Feb, 24, the Fed
raised the discount rate, the interest
rate it charges on loans to banks, 1/2
a percentage point from 6 1/2 per-
cent to 7 percent. The Fed also

 

*Piease see FED p.4.

in Lee Chapel, and again when elec-
ted, that the Student Activities
Board is such a committee that
needs to be reconsidered in terms of
fairness.

When in office next year, Finkel-
stein and Dumas both said they
want to work to get the SCC ‘‘back
on its feet.”’

“*Part of the class officers’ re-
sponsibility is to serve as disciplin-
arians. The SCC members feel they
have been dealt a blow and they de-
serve more credit,’’ Finkelstein
said.

Better educating the student body
about the honor code is also a con-
cern, according to Finkelstein and
Dumas, for next year.

“I. think Chris Giblin made a
good point in his campaign that we
all feel. The honor code is some-
thing to be respected, not fear
Finkelstein said. Both stressed that
the honor system’s investigation
process before a possible closed
hearing is a fact-finding process.
‘“We ask ourselves at each step: do
we have enough here to warrant fur-
ther investigation?”’

Both Giblin and Parker plan tc
run for the positions of class rep-

EC _ finalizes

Genrenne Mongno
Staff Reporter

 

The Executive Committee voted
Monday night to finalize several
revisions to the White Book
concerning the selection of the
chairperson and other. officials for
a student body hearing.

The revisions, which were
drawn up by EC Member Dan
DuPre and second-year law
student John Falk, are intended to
ensure that if a problem arises
with the chairperson of a student
body hearing he or she can be
changed.

Currently, the president ot
the Student Bar Association
(SBA) serves as the chairperson
of a student body hearing. The
revisions state that upon request
of either the accused or a
majority of the EC, and
contingent upon the approval of
both parties, the chairperson may
be substituted by another member
of the SBA Board of Governors.

In addition, the revisions
state that upon the expiration of
time within which a student body
hearing may be requested, the
accused and/or the E.C. have 24

Beard 1s

By R.J. Thomas
Staff Reporter

 

Lexington’s Police Chief Bruce
M. Beard was very pleased with the
way Washington and Lee students
handled this year’s Fancy Dress
weekend.

The majority of police activity in
Lexington this weekend was not
due to W&L students. Lexington
Police made only five arrests for
drunk driving that were directly at-
tributable to FD. Chief Beard said
there were a total of seven ‘‘drunk
in public’’ incidents this weekend,
but that these were in no way all at-
tributable to W&L.

Even though more officers were
on duty over the weekend the
majority of their time was spent giv-
ing out tickets for traffic violations.

Chief Beard said the damp
weather conditions may have had
an effect on the weekend’s activi-
lies, causing people to stay inside.
This would account for the low
number of drunk in public inci-
dents.

“Tt was quicter than last year,”’
Beard said, ‘‘the fraternities com-
plied well with amplified sound
permits and there were very few ci-
tizen complaints.’’ Chief Beard said
it compared, in general, with an
average weekend during Rush.
““We answered about the same
number of calls and issued about
the same number of summonses,’
Beard said.

“Tt was my 20th Fancy Dress
Weekend,’ said Beard, ‘‘and I was
very pleased with it.”’

In other business, the E.C.

last week when one SAB member

The theme of Fancy Dress is

it on Thursday after the theme

the member did not realize the

was in error he pulled the

Grove said he was convinced that
it was simply an impulsive idea

might have been hurt. He said he
hoped in future years everyone
will be aware that those
privileged to know the theme
before the general public should
not sell any memorabilia before
the theme is officially announced
or during the time the SAB is
selling the official memorabilia.

EC Vice President Hugh
Finkelstein was elected to be next

Sophomore EC member Willard

The E.C. announced that

‘pleased’ with FD weekend

Staunton was also pleased with this
weekend.

“I was really pleased with the
students, they deserve a lot of cre-
dit,’’ Stevens said. Stevens said not
having a beer garden at this years’
Ball was a message by students say-
ing, “‘we don’t want it at the Ball.”’
Stevens also said that the wet
weather may have played a role in

making it a quict weekend.

He said he thought alcohol con-
sumption was down in Lexington,
especially in fraternities, but he also
said that alcohol consumption is
down on a national level as well.

The ABC in Virginia is an inde-
pendant department of the Com-
monwealth of Virginia with the
same jurisdiction and authority as

Stevens was the only ABC agent
on duty this weekend. He said it’s
not hard to work with W&L stu-
dents. “‘If it’s a W&L student,’’ he
said, “‘you can assume that what

they’re telling you is true.’

The only complaint Stevens had
about this year’s Fancy Dress wee-
kend was that he didn’t get a chance
to see the decorations,

OPINION

Improvements

at The Phi

This newspaper you are reading is a very special product.
It is the culmination of years of planning and refining.

This issue is the first time that The Ring-tum Phi has been
completely produced on the Washington and Lee campus.

Complete in-house production is an important step for The
Phi. In the past The Phi went through three work stages
over three days before the final product landed in front of
the Pit. Now, all the work is concentrated into two stages
over two days. The amount of time saved is immeasurable,
not to mention the amount of money saved.

Previously, production of the paper started on Tuesday
night with the collecting and typing of copy. Generally, it
took about five hours to type all the copy into the
computer.

Wednesday night (after all of our copy was returned to
campus from the News-Gazette) the pages were designed
and copy cut and pasted. Staff members often didn’t
struggle out of the office until 1 a.m.

Thursday mornings were the most fun, when we took care
of the final corrections, the pictures and small details. Add
another five hours.

The Phi now has its own LaserWriter that allows the staff
to produce all copy in our own office. On Thursday
morning we spend only one hour laying down pictures.

All of this is important to know as The Phi looks for
editors for next year. Gone are the days when editors were
expected to work almost 20 hours a week to put out the
paper. Editors now have unlimited control over copy and
style with relative ease. The Phi can be put together in less
than six hours. Can anyone resist the opportunity to say
they served as executive editor of the school newspaper?
Now it’s even easier.

We would be remiss if we didn’t recognize who is
responsible for the changes at The Phi. Heidi Read pushed
for the LaserWriter; she researched the possiblities, got
estimates, and convinced Brian Shaw that it was absolutely
necessary.

Publications at Washington and Lee serve an important
purpose on campus. They inform, entertain and act as a

voice of the students. Please consider serving on a
publication next year.

The Students’
newspaper

Unsigned opinions that appear in this column are those of
The Ring-tum Phi’s editorial board, which consists of the
tri-editors and the editors of the editorial page. However,
we will occasionally publish editorials that are not supported
by the entire board; those pieces carry the initials of the
author.

The Ring-tum Phi, as the Washington and Lee student
newspaper, feels an obligation to publish each and every
student-opinion piece it receives, and we encourage students
and other members of the W&L community to submit
letters or “‘My Views.’’ However, we reserve the right to
edit any and all submissions for reasons of taste, libel,
clarity or length.

The Phi is your newspaper, not ours. The quality and
diversity of its opinion page is dependent on your
submissions.

Any student interested in serving as
editor of The Ring-tum Phi next year
should submit a letter of interest to the
Publications Board by 5 p.m. on March
17. Interviews will be conducted on
Monday, March 20. The board’s office
is in room 208 of the University Center.

The Ring-tum Phi is published every Thursday during the undergraduate school year
at Washington and Lee University, Lexington, Virginia. Funding for The Ring-tum Phi
comes primarily from advertising and from a portion of the student activities fee. The
Publications Board elects the chief editors and business manager, but The Ring-tum Phi
is otherwise independent.

Letters to the Editor and submissions must be in The Ring-tum Phi office, Room 208 of
the Student Center, by 5 p.m. Tuesday of the week they are to be run. Or send them to
The Ring-tum Phi, Box 899, Lexington, VA 24450. This newspaper observes current
court definitions of libel and obscenity.

 

Talk about deja vu. It seems
like just last week we were
complaining that film director
Martin Scorsese should have been
more sensitive and less offensive to
Christianity in bringing The Last
Temptation of Christ to the big
screen, And now the same scolding
seems appropriate for Salman
Rushdie, whose Satanic Verses fired

a big round across the bow of |

Islam.
The similarity of course ends

there; as far as we know, there
weren’t any contracts out on
Scorsese’s head. Westerners,
accustomed to contrary opinions,
have become used to hearing ideas
they find offensive. (But then, it
may not be such a good thing that
most Christians accepted The Last
Temptation without even a murmur
of protest; maybe a middle ground
between Khomeni-style outrage and
American apathy would have said
more for the degree of conviction
Western Christians attach to their
beliefs.)

Anyway, given the lesson in
‘tolerance ‘just learned, it Seéms

firing off extremist, outrage-laden
condemnations of Khomeni is not
the most prudent course; in fact,
Rushdie’s hat may not be all white,
and (dare we say it?) the
Ayatollah’s not all black.

While it is certainly necessary
to condemn Khomeni’s death
threats, it seems a few stones should
also be lobbed Rushdie’s way.
Certainly he has the right to say
whatever he wants, but is legality
all that matters? As Islamic scholar
John Esposito recently told U.S.
News and World Report, religious
affronts are, ‘‘tricky waters’’ that
call for at léast some amount of

self-censorship. ‘‘The
Amendment right doesn’t mean you
should automatically say everything
you want to,”’ and, says Esposito,

there’s no one knowledgeable about.-«
Islam who couldn’t have seen an...

explosion coming.
Regardless _ of

appropriate, some degree of Islamic
anger is -- and Western Christians,

with Scorsese’s film fresh in their +

memories, should be at least

somewhat empathetic.

Bizarre weather and bizarre weddings

MY VIEW

By Jon Sbar

After years of carbon monoxide,
acid rain, nuclear waste and apple
cores which are supposed to
disintegrate, Mother Nature decided
to get even with the human race.
She would start another ice age and
freeze everyone to death.

Right about the time she was
getting the Poles ready for her icy
revenge, Mother Nature’s good
friends February and March came
to her with an even better idea.
March, being sunny and full of
flowers, would sneak into February’s
place and make all the humans think
it was spring, and February, being
grey and cold, would hit the world
with a surprise attack. Mother
Nature was keen on the idea but
first wanted to give it a trial run in
her home state of Virginia. So far,
her plan is working.

Since we’re on the subjects of

 

To the Editors:

To Lip Synchers

aberrations of Nature it would only
be right to discuss a recent (six
months ago) Miss Manners column
on the subject of Nude Weddings.
Before stripping away the misconceptions
surrounding this exciting and fleshy
topic, the reader requires some historical
background on Miss Manners.
Zsa Zsa ‘‘The Chest’’ Garbonzi
was at the pinnacle of her career as
a topless dancer at the Zanzabar
Lounge (making over $100 in tips
on a good night) when her dentist
(under the influence of nitrous
oxide) make the mistake of giving
her a frontal lobotomy. At that
point, Zsa Zsa quit her job, changed
her name to Miss Manners and
became an advice columnist. Now
she informs concemed readers
which way they should pass red
cabbage around the table and
whether or not it’s acceptable to
blow your nose on the table cloth
at grandmother’s house.
Now, back to the tantalizing topic
of Nude Weddings. The letter from
a concerned mother can be

summarized as follows:

1) The good news is my only
daughter plans to be married.
2) The bad news is that she and
the groom plan on being nude for
the ceremony.

3) When I invite my friends to the
wedding, should I mention the

nudity factor, and if so, how

should it be done?

Let’s analyze question 3.
Assuming the mother tells her
friends about the unique wedding
conditions, let’s consider some of
her options. First, the subtle
approach:

Dear Friends, We request the
honor of your presence at the
marriage of our daughter,
Bethelda Rupperdome, to
Poindexter Madison on Saturday,
February 15. Reception and
dinner to follow.

P.S. The bride and groom will be
slightly indecent.

Now the blunt approach:

Dear Friends, Our nutso daughter
and her fruitcake fiance came up

too

with the ridiculous idea to get

married in the buff, so if you ©

come, expect to see a butt-naked
bride and gvoom. The minister
will probably be wearing a G-

string and I bet the maid of '

honor shows up in a_ black

negligee.

Despite the mother’s fears, I
imagine the wedding had perfect «

attendance. If you were invited I

bet you’d go. What could liven up‘
those boring wedding vows more''y

than naked participants?

First. «

Yew professors, instructors chosen

 

y Henry Ferris
laff Reporter

 

For most W&L students, the
eek after Fancy Dress marks a
turn to an academic reality long
irgotten during four nights and
iys of parties. To department
‘ads, however, this week begins
e long and arduous task of filling
icant faculty positions for the next
‘ademic year.

‘There will be several new faces
2xt year,’’ said Larry C. Peppers,
van of the School of Commerce,
conomics and Politics. He said
iree new faculty members have
ven hired for next year.

The new instructors are Robert
trong, an associate professor of
dlitics at Tulane University, who
‘ill head the politics department;
/illiam King, an associate professor
f accounting at Emory University
id Kip Pirkle, an associate
rofessor at Old Dominion
‘niversity who will join the

ousiness administration staff.

Politics Professor William
Buchanan is retiring and Assistant
Professor of Accounting Arthur
Gumenik is returning to graduate
school.

The mathematics department is
also looking for one or two new
faculty members, according to
Professor Robert Johnson. ‘‘We
hope to find someone to deal with
numerical analysis, ’’ Johnson said,
““‘but we are not restricting our
search to just that.’’

The biology department is also
interviewing to fill one temporary
and two permanent positions.
Thomas G. Nye, professor of
biology, said permanent
appointments will be made in the
fields of immunology and genetics.
The one temporary position in
zoology will relieve Cleveland
Hickman who will be on sabbatical
next year, said Nye.

Two other departments are trying
to fill vacancies because of

professors’ departures. The
psychology department is looking
for a one-year replacement for
Nancy Margand, who will be on
leave next year. The fine arts
department will be hiring a new
East Asian art history professor to
take over for I-Hsiung Ju, who is
retiring at the end of this year.

Several departments have solved
their faculty vacancy problems by
granting permanent positions to
some members who formerly held
temporary instructor status. In the
history department, Roberta H.
Senechal will stay on as an assistant
professor.

The English department has
given a_ full-time position to
Demaree C. Peck, currently a
temporary instructor, who will
concentrate on 20th century
American fiction. Peck and Cathryn
Hankla, an instructor from Hollins
College, are the newest assistant
professors of English.

A Washington and Lee senior was
‘ecently awarded a scholarship to

Jeffrey Schultz, a senior French
najor from Oklahoma City, was one
of 30 students hand-picked for the
institute by the Direct Marketing
Association Educational Foundation.
Most of the students selected were
from colleges and universities in the
Midwest. Schultz was one of two
people selected from the East Coast.

Schultz said he learned about the
institute from his father, who is head
of the advertising department at
Northwestern University.

The institute consisted of five days
of seminars designed to serve as an
introduction to direct marketing.

Schultz said direct- marketing is
a "sub-field" of advertising that
involves selling to a specific group
of people. Speakers at the institute
included presidents of 10 direct
marketing companies.

Schultz said he is planning on a
career in the field of direct

marketing. Following graduation
this year, he plans to attend

for a master’~ degree in marketing.

Roach awarded
Pinney prize

 

By Tina Vandersteel
Staff Reporter

 

The Student Affairs Committee
last week chose John Roach, a
senior from Frankfurt, Ky., to be the
recipient of the 1989 Edward L.
Pinney Prize.

According to the description in
the W&L catalog, the prize recog-
nizes extraordinary commitment
both to personal scholarship and to
the nurturing of intellectual life at
WAL. It was established by the fa-
culty in 1982 in memory of the late
Edward Lee Pinney, who was a
professor of politics from 1963 until
his death in 1980.

Roach said he thought the recog-
nition involved with the award is
good because “‘it makes you think
like everything you do is worth it.”’

Asked why he thought he was
chosen, Roach said he thought it

organizing
to protect
waterfowl

 

From Staff Reports

 

Local outdoorsmen are forming
a Rockbridge chapter of Ducks
Unlimited, the national organization
devoted to the conservation of
waterfowl habitat. The chapter will
hold its Charter Banquet on April
27 at Evans Dining Hall.

The banquet will feature door
prizes, a raffle and an auction.
Organizers expect to have a wide
variety of items available to be won
or bought. A limited edition Ducks
Unlimited shotgun is the raffle prize.
Door prizes and auction items will
range from decoys and shotguns to
outdoor and raffle equipment.

Tickets for the Charter Banquet
cost $40 for singles and $60 for
couples. The price of the ticket
includes a $20 membership fee for
Ducks Unlimited. Those who are
already members pay $20 for a
single ticket and $40 for a couples
ticket.

Organizers of the local chapter
stress the fact that Ducks Unlimited
is not a hunting club. The
organization was incorporated in
1937 and now has nearly 550,000
members. Over the course of its
first SO years, Ducks Unlimited has
translated the $436 million it has
raised on behalf of wild ducks and
geese into more than 5 million acres
of reserved wetland habitat in
Canada, the United States and
Mexico. These acres are utilized
by more than 600 wildlife species,
including several that are
endangered.

Virginia has more than 70
chapters of Ducks Unlimited, with
a total membership of almost 13,000.
Last year, the chapters raised nearly
$350,000 for wetland projects within
the state.

Wetlands are drained routinely at
the rate of up to 400,000 acres each
year in this country alone. As long
as this loss continues, ducks, geese
and a long list of other wildlife
species will be forced to seek
temporary and highly unsuitable
homes.

Organizers state that if Rockbridge
areas outdoorsmen and
outdoorswomen want to do
something about stemming. this
wetland loss and have a good time
doing it, they should plan on joining
the new Rockbridge chapter of
Ducks Unlimited and attending the
Charter Banquet on April 27,

Thirty-nine W&L students will
spend spring term in six Soviet
cities and W&L sophomore
Garrick Slate will be attending
classes during the upcoming
school year in Moscow.

History Professor Richard
Bidlack may be setting a new
spring term tradition by leading
the first group of W&L students
to travel in the USSR. Slate is
part of the initial group of
American under-graduate students
to study at Soviet universities.

Bidlack said of the program,
“The idea is © twa @
Gorbachev’s changes, but put
squarely in the context of Soviet
history.”’

A look at Soviet history reveals
there were several reform efforts
in the 1920s and 1960s. The
1980s reform movements of
peresuoika and glasnost resemble
these earlier efforts, said Bidlack.

The group will be traveling to
six cities in the USSR, including
Moscow, Tbilisi and Leningrad.

Other people remembered various events of the

Fancy Dress since the beginning of the year.

“T expected it to be like a prom, with a really
negative attitude, but it was MUCH better,”’ said

The general consensus of the freshmen was that

W&L, Nona Mchedlishvili.

Mchedlishvili said the Tbilisi
trip will allow the students to
make important observations
about the USSR.

“It helps them to see that the
Soviet Union is kind of a union
of countries,’ she said.

Mchedlishvili said USSR
republics are more individually
distinctive than the American
states. Each republic has its own
culture and language.

‘“‘They can at least see a not
Russian republic. They can
compare how much difference is
between them. To learn
something, they have to begin
from this,”’ said Mchedlishvili.

Students who are traveling to
the USSR must choose a topic
for a 10 to 15 page paper
focusing on some aspect of
reform. The actual trip is a 24-

background is far more extensive
than most of his fellow travelers.

Mchedlishvili said the group
will be well-received by the
Soviet peoples. ‘‘Different styles
of life, different systems,
sometimes you think the people
are different,’’ Mchedlishvili said.
“Americans always are very
special guests.’’ Mchedlishvili’s
words must be especially good
news to Slate. He was warned
by a program adviser that school
and life in the USSR will be
challenging for an American.

“‘T think that if someone didn’t have a good time,
then it had to do with their date, not the ball,’’ said
freshman Elise Bryant.

“The bad thing about a weekend-long date is ,

that at other parties you can’t look at other girls, so

Rich Redfoot

 

Golfers set to tee up

 

 

 

By Jay Plotkin
Assistant Sports Editor

 

Last year, senior Rich
Redfoot took the season off
from wrestling. This season,
he finished fifth in the NCAA
Division III tournament,
earning All-America honors,
W&L’s first ever All-
American in wrestling.

For his accomplishment’s
Redfoot has been named The
Ring-tum Phi's Athlete-of-the-
Month for February.

As a sophomore, Redfoot
was 17-6 and qualified for the
NEAA Division Ill
tournament, while leading the
team in takedowns. This
year, the senior from
Chehalis, Washington, started
at 177 pounds, but midway
through made the step up to
190. He breezed through the
regular season with a record

despite early trouble

By Mike Shady
Snorts Editor

 

The past eight months have not
been particularly kind to the
Washington and Lee golf team.

In that time span, the Generals,
the defending Old Dominion
Athletic Conference champions, lost
four of their top golfers to
graduation. And if that wasn’t bad
enough, the team also lost a
regulation practice facility as all 18
greens at W&L’s home course, the
Lexington Country Club, were
damaged prior to the start of the
fall season due to fertilization
problems.

Add to that the fact that the
spring weather in the Shenandoah
Valley has done its best
impersonation of Norther Alaska,
and you have a situation that is not
conducive to the golfers getting out
of the gate with a fast start.

But head coach Buck Leslie,
whose team finished with a 9-3
record last season and a bid to the
NCAA Division III __ national
championships last season, as well
as that ODAC title, remains patient
and optimistic.

‘“*‘We just have to do what we

an,” he said.

The main obstacle Leslie has had
to face has been greens travesty.
The Generals have been practicing
at the Lexington Country Club with
temporary greens, which basically
amounts to a flag stick to shoot at
from the fairway. To compound
matters, the course has also been
shortened dramatically because of
the greens problem.

This has caused Leslie, who has
never had a losing season in his 14
years at the W&L golf helm, much
trouble in terms of making fair

assessments of the young players
trying out for the team this season,
especially of their short games.

“It has been a difficult thing to
evaluate,’” he said. ‘‘It’s going to
take some time tc really sort them
out.”

One thing Lod: can count on
is the play of returning seniors Tom
Wingfield and Pete Coleman. Both
players were key contributors in last
season’s successful finish.

“‘They’re are only carry over
{from last year’s team],’’ Leslie
said. ‘‘They both have excellent
work habits which is a big plus for
both of them.”

Those two wili lead the Generals
into this weekend’s James Madison
Invitational in Harrisonburg.
Joining Wingfield and Coleman will
be sophomore Brian Kopet and
freshmen Jay McKnight and David
Carroll. Leslie, however, says this
is, by no means, the set lineup for
future matches,

“There has been tremendous
competition among the players,’’ he
said. ‘‘They [the freshmen] can
sense the opportunity to play.”’

But it’s the lack of play on
regulation tees and regulation greens
that has drawn the head coach’s
most concern, and will most likely
give W&L problems ais weekend.

‘“‘We might get hurt around the
greens, but that’s natural,’’ said
Leslie. ‘‘This is the first step in a
series of steps and it’s going to take
time before we can work it out.”’

But isn’t the short game one of
-- if not the -- most important facets
of golf?

“‘That’s what it comes down to,”
he said. ‘‘As the pros always say,
“You drive for show, but you putt
for dough.’”’

Virginia State title at
pounds.

Did the year he took off
last season’ hurt his
performance’ this year?
According to Redfoot, no.

“IT don’t think the year off
really hurt. I was getting
kind of burned out. I’ve been
wrestling for quite a while. I
think it helped as far as that,
being motivated a little bit
more, and _ being more
directed. I think I might have
lost some bad habits I may
have picked up wrestling, like
laziness and going in sloppy

on moves. I think actually it
improved some of my
technique.”’

Redfoot’s only loss during
the regular season was in the
Lebanon Valley Invitational to
Larry Danko -- an All-
American

last season -- of

Kings College. In the
tournament, Redfoot still came
in third at 177.

Redfoot then claimed the

W&L Invitational. Against
Division I Virginia Tech,

Redfoot scored an impressive
18-1 technical fall just 4:44
into the match. At the state
meet held in Newport News
Redfoot was named _ the
Outstanding Wrestler in the
tournament. He claimed the
190 pound title with an 11-1
win over a two-time Division
II All-American.

At the Regional tournament,
Redfoot came in second,
losing in the finals in
overtime to a Division III All-
American from Ithaca.

So it was on to the National
tournament where  Redfoot
extracted revenge on the only
man to beat him in. the

his first round match 14-6,
Redfoot found himself paired
in a quarterfinal match with
Danko.

Said Redfoot, ‘‘I knew it
was going to be a tough
match from the first time we
wrestled. I knew it was

want to do anything stupid. I
wrestled conservatively, kept
it close, and things turned out.

but I knew it would take my
best effort.”’

Redfoot defeated Danko in
overtime to advance to the
semifinal round, where he lost
to Dean Gavin, 8-4. He then
lost his first consolation match
5-2, before regrouping to win
his final collegiate match for
fifth place, 4-0.

‘The first match wasn’t
really a chalienge. But from

then on, all my matches were
real tough,’’ said Redfoot.
“At that point it's more
mental than physical. You
just have to be mentally into
it. I think the first night I
was psyched up. When I lost
my semifinal match, I had a
big let down mentally, and
my next match I wasn’t very
pleased with. But then for
fifth and sixth place, I got
back into it.’’

He finished the season 23-4-
1, giving him a final career
record of 56-15-1.

Women’s tennis split two

By Beckwith Archer
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee women’s
tennis team has begun its quest for
the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference championship and an
NCAA ranking. The Generals made
two road trips last week, and their
record now stands at 1-1.

Though the Generals showed signs
that they are not in peak form, they
were able to pull out a victory last
Thursday against Virginia
Commonwealth University. After
four matches, VCU led 3-1, with
the win coming from freshman
Colleen Quinn at No. 4 singles, 6-
4, 6-4.

The Generals drew even at 3-3
after the singles behind three-set
wins from senior Benny Savage and
junior Teresa Southard.

As the sun began to set, the
temperature dropped, and it looked
as if the match would be postponed
due to poor playing conditions. The
VCU coach, however, made do with
what little lighting was working, and
sent out the Nos. 1 and 2 doubles
teams. The matches were shortened
to eight game pro-sets due to the
conditions.

The pressure was on for W&L

Senior midfielder Stu  Geisel
opened the scoring in the second
period, scoring with 14:07 left in
the half. The teams then traded
goals, with Ware getting his third
goal to make the score 5-2 W&L.
With just five seconds left in the
half, sophomore attackman Brian
Overbeck found midfielder Chris
Mastrogiovanni open in the
crease, and the junior scored to
give the Generals a 6-2 halftime
lead.

Then, to begin the second half,

not to lose the season opener, and
the Generals responded to the
challenge as both of the W&L
(cams won tight matches.
Sophomore Jean Stroman and Quinn
won 8-6, and sophomores Kathy
Leake and Kelly Martone
immediately followed with an 8-5
victory. The No. 3 doubles team
did not play, making the final score
5-3 in W&L’s favor.

“We didn’t play that well,” said
co-head coach David McLeod. ‘‘We
started out rusty. Inclement weather
has severely hampered our practice
time. However, we played hard and
we were able to win the close
matches. That was the difference.
Our doubles is definitely our strong
point this year,”’

Things were not quite so pleasant
on Tuesday when the Generals took
on another Division | team, Virginia
Tech, The Hokies defeated the
Generals 9-0. ‘‘We got an old-
fashioned butt-whupping,’’ said
McLeod.

The Generals get a chance to
perform at home this weekend.
There will oe a tournament Friday
and Saturday with teams Emory &
Henry, Randolph-Macon (Ashland),
and Virginia Wesleyan participating.

opener 5-4

Geisel won the faceoff and
scored on the run in just seven
seconds. That goal started a six
goal W&L explosion in the third
quarter.

“‘We scored with five seconds
to go in the half, and then we
come out and score right off the
opening faceoff of the second
half,’ said head coach Dennis
Daly, “In a matter of 12
seconds, the game has gone from

Women’s lacrosse starting with high hopes

 

oe

 

By Amy Packard
Staff Reporter

 

Optimism. That is the one word
that epitomizes the Washington and
Lee women’s lacrosse team as it
enters its first varsity season. And
this optimism is not without basis,
either.

As a club sport last year, the
Generals posted a respectable 4-7
record in exhibition games. Enough
success to satisfy any head coach,
right? Wrong. This season, with
more experience and new recruits,
the caliber of talent on the squad
has risen and W&L has set its goals
even higher.

“T have high expectations, I
guess,’’ said head coach Janine
Hathom. ‘‘I honestly think we
stand a good chance of being .500
or better. I think we can do quite
well.”

Hathorn, also the coach of
W&L’s women’s soccer team, is no
Stranger to success with a fledgling
program. She turned that team into
contenders in just its second year
at varsity status, a performance that
earned her Old Dominion Athletic
Coach-of-the- Year honors. She sees
those same sorts of positives in her

Lacrosse

 

(continued from page 6)

being a 5-2 ball game to a 7-2
game, and that’s a big difference.
I think those two goals were
probably the two key goals of the

ball game.”’
Geisel, sophomore Todd
Garliss, _ Moseman, freshman

Drew Anton and Ware, who got
his fourth goal of the day, all
found the net for W&L in the
period.

Freshman Matt Zamaloff scored
in the fourth quarter to give the
Generals their final 13-3 margin
of victory.

Once again, sophomore Tom
Costello was stellar in goal,
making eight saves.

“T think our team is playing
with confidence right now,’’ said
Daly. ‘“‘I think the team is

, confident in Tommy [Costello],

  

lacrosse team.

“Tam very excited about this
team and this program,”’ she said.
“The interest has been high, we’ve
had a good number of people out,
and they’ve been working hard and
responding to all the demands.”’

Although it is exciting to be

competing at the varsity level,
Hathorn looks at the transition as
creating a few difficulties for the
Generals.
“Relatively, we may not seem to
do much better than last year for
two reasons,” she said. ‘‘First, we
have more games. Second, as a
new team [last season] we got to
play without following all the rules.
For example, we could sub
whenever we wanted. This year
we’re within the rules and, since we
are a varsity team, our opponents
are going to be playing to beat us
more.”’

There is a good supply of talent
that should be up to the challenge,
however. Last year’s team Most
Valuable Player, sophomore Katy
Richard, returns as do 11 other
letterwinners. Senior Stephanie
Smith, the Coach’s Award winner,
will join forces with Richard and

It is a tremendous boost to the
team to know that the man in
between the pipes is going to
cover for their mistakes.

On Wednesday, the Generals
opened their Old Dominion
Athletic Conference season
against the Yellow Jackets of
Randolph-Macon College.

It was a game in which Daly
thought the Generals needed to
score early and often to defeat
the Yellow Jackets.

W&L managed to take an early
lead, scoring with just 1:04 gone
into the game. Ware scored the
goal off an assist from Overbeck.
Macon tied the game at the end
of the quarter on a goal with 45
seconds left.

W&L.--then-----scored----two
unanswered goals in the second
period to take a 3-1 lead at
halftime. Mastrogiovanni scored
with 14:09 left in the half off an
assist from Moseman. Then with
11:37 left, Ware found Anton for
the freshman’s second goal of the
season.

sophomore Brooke Tinley to lead
the Generals’ offense. Freshmen
Whitney Hopkins and Julie Vennes
should play important roles at
midfield, while senior Alston Parker,
junior Melissa Jones, and
sophomores Melinda Conkling and
Anne Gregory shore up the defense.
Freshman Erica Ingersoll is expected
to handle the goalkeeping duties.

Those freshmen could prove
important as the 24-member team
is composed of nine freshmen.

“The freshman class is going to
boost our whole level of play,’’ said
Hathorn.

W&L’s strategy is to gain
victories against the teams the
Generals defeated or played close
last season, while narrowing the
scoring margin against those schools
who beat W&L handily. Hathorn
thinks the goal of 8-7 is possible,
based on the enthusiasm and hard
work the team has shown in the
preseason.

“If we can keep up our positive
experiences and they are any
indication of how we’ll play, we’ ll
perform very well,’ said Hathorn.

The Generals begin their season
Friday at home at 4 p.m. on Liberty
Hall Field against Frostburg.

In the second half, things just
didn’t go the Generals way.
Randolph-Macon scored in once
in the third quarter and then
twice early in the fourth to take a
4-3 lead. Ric Westervelt scored
two of the goals, both unassisted.
J.D. Macey’s second goal of the
game gave the Yellow Jackets the
lead with 11:47 left.

W&L then looked to its All-
American, and Ware came
through.

With the Generals on the power
play, Ware scored unassisted to
tic the game with 6:47 left. It
was the second straight multiple
goal game from Ware.

The game remained tied

Harrington found Westervelt open

gave the Yellow Jackets a 5-4
win, their first ever over the
Generals.

Said Daly after the game, ‘‘We
dominated them in every phase of
the game, except the score, and I
guess that’s why they keep the
score. You don’t get extra points
for picking up ‘x’ number of
ground balls.”’

WA&L outshot R-MC 55-17, had
an 89-57 groundball advantage,
won 12 of the 13 faceoffs and
had a much higher success rate
clearing the ball.

““We just have to put this loss
behind us and concentrate on

“T hope I was prophetic when I
said that the ODAC champion
would have one loss.

[MIKE SHADY]

See monkey see,
Sea monkey do

Something has been bugging me all year long and I finally figured it out
the other night. It was your ordinary evening at the sports editor's residence
-- pizza in one hand, remote control in the other -- and while flipping back
and forth between MTV's Martha Quinn (Talk about scary late-night TV) and
her new show, Deja-Video, and ESPN's uncomfortable-as-hell-to-watch Tim
Brando and Sportscenter, the answer, or more the question, hit me. Why is
W&L’s nickname, the ‘‘Generals,’’ so boring? In a country where the
Spiders of Richmond, the Salukis of Southern Illinois and the Hoyas of
Georgetown exist, why must a dubuhyueneller be referred to as someone who
most likely smokes cigars, is overweight and says intelligent things like
“‘Peace is made possible only through war."’?

Well, you say, because Robert E. Lee and George Washington were
generals, stupid. Not good enough, at least for me, anyway. Nicknames
were (and are) made up by sportswriters, mainly to make their jobs easier
when it comes to writing games stories and the like. So, why should we be
stuck with somebody else’s nickname? Just because the name ‘‘Generals”’
popped up in some clown’s story, we've been christened as such for eternity?
I think not. Besides, we don’t even have a person dress up as a General for
sporting events. And what about the women’s teams (this is an issue my
predecessor brought up). A woman cannot obtain the ranking of five-star
general because it requires combat duty, something women are not allowed
to perform in this man’s Army. You can’t put ‘‘Lady’’ in front of
“‘Generals’’ because what you end up with is a very bad oxymoron, and no
one wants to be known as a moron of any kind. And aren't you sick of
people sarcastically telling you how clever your school is for coming up with
such an appropriate nickname?

Therefore, I turn your attention to that glistening example set forth by the
students of the University of California at Santa Cruz. Two years ago they
were called the Sea Lions (booooormriiinnnggg). Now, after a school-wide
vote and petition, they are known as the infamous Banana Slugs (Yes! The
Banana Slugs). Not bad for a bunch of burned out surfer heads.

The time has come to top these beach bums and demand a change in the
school nickname. And, since sportswriters started this whole mess, I feel
qualified in making the choice for the nickname. Ready? How does the
Washington and Lee Sea Monkeys grab ya?

Think about it. First, the controversy. What exactly is a Sea Monkey?
Is it really an animal? Is it even alive? And what does a Sea Monkey
actually do?

Second, the possibilities. Students can be handed little packets of sea
monkeys (to be billed home, of course) in the matriculation line each fall.
We can have sea monkey T-shirts, baseball caps and sweatshirts -- stuff we
don’t have with the Generals moniker on them. How about a huge aquarium
in the Warner Center lobby with royal blue and white sea monkeys floating
around in it? (I’m sure they exist in these colors, although I confess I am not
well read in sea monkey literature) We can have Sea Monkey Day or Sea
Monkey Week. Visiting teams will be totally bewildered when they compete
against the W&L Sea Monkeys. What's your game plan for a Sea Monkey?
And, while we're at it, we should take down that statue of that pansy George
Washington and replace instead with a likeness of a sea monkey. | think,
tastefully done, a sea monkey would add a touch of class to the red bricks
and white columns of the colonadde.

Third, the song. Let’s change the words to the W&L Swing. How’s this
for openers:

Come cheer for Washington and Lee/
The home of the cool sea monkey!

Fourth and finally, the school spirit. Wouldn’t you be proud to root for
a sea monkey? I know I would. And don’t let appearances fool you, either.
Sea monkeys are tough -- much tougher than a general could ever be.

The time has come for a change. I even have a battle cry for when we
storm Washington Hall, petition in hand. ‘‘Give us sea monkeys, or give us
death!’’ Robert E. Lee would have been proud.

Tourist is year’s best film

 

W&L Weekly Calendar.

 

Receives Academy Award nods for Best Picture and Supporting Actress

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

Macon Leary is a little bit
different than you and me.
Different, because Macon Leary
lives in a world where everything
is well-organized, unemotional
and to some extent drab. He
seems to thrive’ on __ the
consistency that a never changing
life offers. He lives his life in the
same ever changing world that
the rest of us live in, but unlike
the rest of us, Macon ignores it.

Macon Leary is only the first
of the phenomenal characters who
Anne Tyler develops in her
acclaimed novel The Accidental
Tourist, the film version of
which starring William Hurt,
Kathleen Tumer and Geena Davis
hasbeen nominated for a 1989

Academy Award Best Picture
award.
The story follows Macon

(Hurt), a writer who writes travel
guides under the guise of The
Accidental Tourist. Leary and his
wife Sarah (Turner) begin the
film one year after their son was
needlessly killed by a man
holding up a store. Sarah has
decided at the beginning of the
film that she wants to divorce
Macon because she can’t stand
the way he has dealt with the
death of his son alone without
her.

Following the split, Macon
has to leave for London to gather
information for a new travel
guide. Before leaving, however,
Macon has to drop his Welsh
Corgie Edward at the kennel. It
is here that he meets Muriel
Pritchett (Davis), the one kind of
woman who it seems Macon
could never understand or come
close to loving. It is through this
relationship, though, that Macon
finds out who he really is.

The Accidental Tourist is an
incredibly well-made, beautiful
film that, in my mind, deserves
the Academy Award for Best
Picture. Although Dustin Hoffman

  
 

gave the performance of a

Rain Man, The
Accidental Tourist is on the
whole a better film. Nothing
about the film is lacking in
anything. The casting, the writing,
the direction and_ the
cinematography are all
overwhelming. To some
moviegoers the film might tend
to. drag briefly in a few places,
but viewed in context of the
entire film, it almost seems
intentional.

The Accidental Tourist is a
film that has a little bit of
everyone in it. Too often we rush
through life forgetting that
everything we do and everyone
we meet make up what we call
life. In retrospect, life is not a
chain of appointments made, bills
that were paid or time that was
spent fulfilling the same schedule
day after day. Life is a series of
experiences that uniquely
influence a part of our lives in
addition to permanently changing
the way we think or feel from
that point forward.

In addition to the Best Picture
nomination, The Accidental
Tourist received a_ Best
Supporting Actress nomination for
Ceena Davis for her role as
Muriel, a Best Adapted
Screenplay nomination for Frank
Galati and Lawrence Kasdan
(who sas sadly looked over in
the directing nominations) and a
Best Musical Score nomination
for John Williams.

As stated, the casting was
superb. Reunited for the first time
since Body Heat, William Hun

fraternity because KA _ president

Scott McArron was on the panel

and could speak for his fraternity.
There was only a brief debate

on reverse discrimination: — the
effectivness and need for
affirmative action programs in

minority contracting firms which
was sparked by the recent Supreme
Court decision to impose new tests
on “‘set-asides’’ for minority
contracting firms.

Most of the forum time
focused on the equality of black
Opportunities for joining
organizations, especially fraternities,
at W&L.

The audience of 20 students

and faculty members were

permitted to state their views on
black opportunities in fraternities
on campus after being called on by
the forum mediator, Christopher
deMovellan.

Sophomore Damon Sanders
said that all fraternities are open to
everyone in theory, yet there are a
number of fraternities that have the
reputation of not admitting blacks,
and thus are not truly open to
blacks.

Panel member Mary Alice
McMorrow, a junior dorm
counselor, cited incidents of black
freshmen being treated well during
the early stages of rush at certain

fraternities in order to give the
appearance of being open to
blacks, when in fact, later in the
process, the black rushees were not
considered for bids.

Freshman class President Willie
Henderson reiterated this feeling
that black freshman were led along
by certain fraternities simply for
appearances sake, when in fact
they were never considered as
candidates for bids.

Panel member Scott Jackson,
manager of the MSA house, also
agreed with Henderson and cited
Kappa Alpha as one of the
offenders.

KA was continually referred
to during the discussion as one of

Tomorrow is St. Patrick’s

Put on some green and pinch someone, but be careful

 

By Joelle Jackson

 

Staff Reporter
Tomorrow is March 17th.
Those who have an_ intimate

relationship with their calendars
will realize that this is St. Patrick’s
Day. Tomorrow adults around the
world will drink green beer and
make merry.

There will also be a few select
children scarred for life because
they have worn the wrong color to
school. (These same children’s
teachers will then make a pathetic

mpt to remedy this situation by
; Sob a shamrock made of green
‘ construction paper to their shirts.)

The tradition, however, runs much
deeper.

St. Patrick, the patron saint of
Ireland, was born in Scotland in
387. When he was 16 he was
captured by Irish raiders, then sold
as a slave to a high priest. He
served the priest for six years
and learned the Celtic language.
When he was able to escape from
his master, he fled to the west
coast of Ireland. There he boarded
a ship and landed in Britain a few
days later. He devoted himself to
religious work and decided to

Pledgeship tests fraternity loyalty

 

By Allen Litvak
Staff Reporter

 

Fraternity initiation week
represents the culmination of
pledgeship. At the end of this
week the pledges are initiated and
enjoy all the rights. of being a
fraternity brother.

This week is the last chance for
the fraternity to test the pledge
class’ ability to unify and to
demonstrate their fraternal loyalty.

For example, last year’s Fiji
pledge class shaved their heads
during initiation week. Tyler
Suiters, a member of that pledge
class, said, ‘‘It was our own idea.
We got mohawks to show unity
and loyalty to the house. Actually,
eight out of 17 got mohawks, and
the other nine got flat-tops.”’

This year fraternities are using
a new pledge program in which
the freshmen rush and accept bids

in the fall but do not begin
pledgeship until January.
Leroy C. ‘*Buddy’’ Atkins,

dean of Greek affairs, said that all
fraternities must initiate by March

25th under this new program.

When questioned about what
concerned him most about
initiation week, Atkins replied,

“‘There may be some houses that
are doing things that are physically
dangerous, like sleep deprivation or
abuse of alcohol. According to the
pledge programs, none of these
things are happening, but what’s
down on paper can be different
from what’s really happening.”’

Atkins also said, ‘Basically,
people conceal from me _ what’s
going on.’

Nonetheless, some rites of
initiation week are demonstrated in
public, such as pledges carrying
boxes or bricks. Atkins described
these public displays as
“‘borderline hazing.”’

Ross Singletary, president of the
IFC, said he was asked about the
consequences of a fraternity being
brought up on charges of sleep
deprivation or alcohol abuse. He
said, ‘‘Both fypothetical charges
are serious violations, and
depending upon the severity, we
would hand down some
punishment. This punishment

would have to be hammered out in
an IFC meeting since there is no

precedent to go by.’’ As far as
this year’s __initiation’s week,
Singletary said, ‘‘To my

knowledge everything is going
fine.””

While some fraternities are in
the midst of their initiation weeks
and other fraternities have yet to
begin, Lambda Chi Alpha initiated
their freshmen Feb. 24. Lambda
Chi President Dirk van Assendelft
said, ‘‘We don’t have pledges, we
have social members. They get
almost full brother rights, right
from the beginning.” van
Assendelft explained Lambda Chi’s

early initiation, saying, “‘We felt,

like seven weeks later they were
ready to become initiated.’’

On the opposite end of the
spectrum, John Stump is a
sophomore pledge who completed
a pledge program last year, only to
pledge a different house this year.
When Stump was asked why he
waited until after initiation week to
depledge he said, ‘I decided to
switch fraternities in the midst of

commissioned him to Ireland.
After arriving in the summer of

paid the price of his freedom and
then converted him and his family

for many years preaching, building
churches and performing miracles.
He and his companions were taken

the houses on campus that, as
Jackson later said, have the image
of being discriminatory toward
blacks, whether or not it is true of
the fraternity members. KA was
singled out largely, as deMovellan
made clear, because the other
fraternities in question were not
represented at the discussion, and
could not defend themselves.

KA’s annual ‘‘Old South’
ball and the fraternity’s Southern
tradition were pointed out as
factors in KA’s categorization as
one of the fraternities on campus
that has a reputation for being
prejudiced toward blacks.

McArron assured the panel and

shamrock (or a little bit of green)
commemorates how St. Patrick
attempted to explain the Trinity to
the Irish. He said the three leaves
represent the three persons of the
Trinity, and the stem symbolizes
the unity of the three in one.

So with this in mind, everyone
can now go out and have fun
tomorrow, and the Irish can be
proud they’re Irish (and all that
good _ stuff). But, please, be
considerate and remember _ that
thousands of people are seriously
injured every year from senseless
pinching; in fact, more than several
lose their eyesight each year from
pinches gone astray.

Pizza smuggling going on

 

By Chris Baradel
Staff Reporter

 

As if there weren’t enough
justification already, add the fact
that they can’t legally get
Domino’s pizza at VMI to the list
of reasons why you should be
thankful you are here at W&L
instead of behind the gray walls.

Domino’s corporation celebrated
March as ‘‘National Nutrition
Month’’ by mailing out pamphlets
extolling the virtues of (surprise,
surprise) pizza as a ‘‘well-balanced
meal.’’

Although Domino’s will be
opening its 5,000th store this
spring, it’s a safe bet that it will

not resemble the one located here
in Lexington. Described by
manager Rush Earman as ‘‘the

Twilight Zone’’ because ‘‘we do
things different,’’ this store is
involved in such diverse endeavors
as a clandestine pizza smuggling
operation, support of the W&L arts
and battling the efforts of crafty
pizza bandits operating out of (say
it ain’t so) Washington and Lee.

The local franchise lives by the
motto ‘‘Necessity is the mother of
invention,’ according to Earman.
He said that, while the store has
no current plans to repeat the
‘‘pizza_wars’’- contests between
fraternities to order the largest
number of pizzas run earlier in the

decade he would ‘‘entertain§ the
idea, because it seems pretty
interesting.”’

He said he would have to look
back at the past history of the
‘‘nizza wars’? promotion, since it
was run before he began working
there. Earman explained that while
Domino’s works’ with _ the

fraternities at the University of
Virginia, he would have to ‘“‘go
through =the proper — channels’’

consulting his supervisors before
approving such an endeavor.

Domino’s does run promotions
in conjunction with W&L,
however. The pizza company paid
for the printing of the tickets for
the University Theatre with a
coupon printed on the back of the
ticket and helped sponsor the
recent lip-synch contest.

But the store’s most interesting
area enterprise is, undoubtedly, the
underground pizza railroad it runs
to the cadets at VMI. Although
cadets are officially forbidden from
ordering pizza there, a few of the
bravest and hardiest souls do sc
anyway, rebelling against — the
system with Domino’s help.

Earman explained the details of
this sordid business. ‘‘We sneak it
in to them. They are not allowed
to order pizza, but they do and we
deliver. We have to sneak it in or
meet them at special places.’’

While there is no penalty for
Domino’s drivers caught on VMI’s
campus, any cadet apprehended
with a pizza in hand must pay for
his transgression with the novel
penalty of extra marching.

Surprisingly, at a university
where the honor code is such a
revered convention, W&L siudents
still heist pizzas from the luckless
delivery-men.

Earman said, ‘“‘They will raid
the driver’s vehicle after he goes
into the building. It usually

audience that KA does not make a
conscious effort to be prejudiced.
In defense of the ‘‘Old South’
ball, McArron said that people
must understand the history of KA,
The fraternity’s first chapter was
established at W&L, which did not
admit blacks until the 1960s.

The ball itself, he said, is a
matter of tradition, not of
prejudice.

In response to questions about
the absence of blacks in_ his
fraternity, McArron said that, in
the time he has been at W&L,
racial issues have never been
brought up with regard to a black
rushee in the sessions when the

Sheinberg
elected

to EC

By Pat Lopes
Staff Reporter

 

 

Campaign posters will stay up
as the attention shifts from last
week’s elections for EC officers to
next week’s elections for class
officers and EC representatives.

Jon Sheinberg was elected EC
secretary in the runoff election held
last Thursday. Sheinberg collected
473 votes, 20 more votes than his
opponent Mike Meers.

Sheinberg said he wants to
introduce the Honor System to
freshmen in a less threatening
manner than has been done in the
past. He also said he wants to
maintain the current status of
student government authority over
student life.

Election day procedures were

questioned by Meers. He said
choosing Thursdays for runoff
elections leads to low voter
turnouts. He also said the number
of ballot boxes should be
increased.

“There’s one ballot box for
every 800 undergraduates and the
law school gets one for every
300,’ said Meers. Although he
said election procedures may not
have caused his defeat, he
suggested that Thursday runoffs
and the accessibility of ballot
boxes should be examined.

1989-90 class presidents, vice
presidents and EC rep elections
will be held Monday with runoffs
on Thursday. Students can vote
from 9 to 5, at the ODK circle,
the Library and the Gilliam Dorm
quad.

The role of presidents and vice
presidents as Student Conduct
Committee (SCC) representatives is
being emphasized in this year’s
elections.

SCC Chairman and senior class
President David Burns, “‘The class

Censorship in
Charlottesville

The University of Virginia has seen better days. As The

Wall Street Journal editorial

page reported Tuesday, the

UVa student council “‘has joined the Campus Crusade for
Liberal Intolerance by censoring the only conservative

publication in Charlottesville.’

In a situation even more serious than the action taken by
the Dartmouth College adminstration against the editors of

The Dartmouth Review,

Why? According to UVa’s appropriations committee, the
magazine has become ‘‘political’’ and is therefore no longer
entitled to funding. Problem: at the same board meeting at
which the Advocate lost its support, several liberal campus
publications had their funding approved, including one that

recently called the CIA an

‘‘outlaw organization’ and

another that said North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms has
written a book titled ‘‘Why I Like White People.’’ Clearly,
UVa’s appropriations committee has found it convenient to

apply two sets of rules.

We commend our colleagues at The Cavalier Daily for

supporting the Advocate

and observing that the

appropriations committee’s standards for funding ‘‘are being
applied politically.’’ And we hope the Journal was right in
saying that Virginians won’t allow this censorship to
continue. ‘‘The state’s taxpayers no doubt more revere their
state’s contribution to Jeffersonian democracy than to liberal
academia’s new double standard.”’

Vote to restore
student power

 

._MY VIEW
By Ann Gregory

The issue of the day at Wash-
ington and Lee is the problem of
student power. We feel that we
have none, or that what we did
have has slowly been siphoned off
’~by the administration. Examples
would included the formation of
‘the Confidential Review Committee
and the creation of the Fraternity
“Renaissance Program. The. probl-

 

--em having been stated and ackno-:

wledged by everyone, let’s do
something about it; let’s bring po-
‘wer back to the students.

We as students are not going
simply to be handed responsibility
by the administration. Rather, we
have to eam it, to deserve it.
Apparently, this was an issue in
the Executive Committee Big
Three elections. But it is more
‘important now that Student
Conduct Committee/class office
elections are approaching. I agree
- -with the Executive Committee that
the class officers’ role as SCC
representative is more important
than, and should be considered
‘before, the specific leadership of
. the class. We should not resign
ourselves to electing party planners
and social organizers. Rather, we
need to consider the role of the
.SCC and its representatives.

- The Student Conduct Committee
hears cases of student misconduct
_ fot covered by the Honor Code.
These cases formerly included
sexual assault and _ racial
aggression. However, these cases
are now being reviewed by the

CRC. The problem, to the best of
my knowledge, was confidentiality
and the makeup of the committee.
If you were on either side of a
sexual assault case, for example,
would you feel comfortable ex-
plaining your situation to a group
of guys who were not prohibited
from discussing the case with
anyone outside the committee? Of
course not. You might not even
have a way of predicting what
kind of verdict and sentence the
committee would hand down. This
is not! the ‘way to handle sensitive
problems on campus.

If we are in favor of student
power, as I know we are, we need
to support student leadership and
responsibility. I am in favor of
strict adherence by the SCC to its
new confidentiality clause, and a
redefinition of its role on campus
vis a vis the CRC and the EC. A
program should be instituted
whereby SCC members are trained
in the effects of misconduct and
violence by the  university’s
professional counseling staff. I
think all students should make it
their responsibility to understand
how student government works,
and that officers should show their
classmates how to make it work
for them. Class officers should
take a look at their roles as
leaders, supporting those activities
in which their classmates take part
and promoting that ever elusive
goal of class unity. Most
importantly, however, I think the
best way for us to show how much
we deserve power is to get out and
vote for SCC and &C
representatives on March 20.

Discrimination:

 

MY VIEW
By Tina Vandersteel

**Washington and Lee fraternities racially
discriminate! Something has to be done!”’

That basically covers the main points made
at panel dicussion cosponsored by the
Minority Student Association and Omicron
Delta Kappa last week. Everyone in the
audience and on the six-member panel agreed,
after an hour and-a-half, that racial
discrimination does occur, even if not on a
house-wide basis. The question then turned to
what to do to stop it. During this time it was
rather pedantically assumed that racial
discrimination is evil.

I want to examine this assumption.

The question is not do fraternity houses
practice racial discrimination. The question
Ought to be: should fraternities be allowed to
practice racial discrimination.

First let us examine discrimination.
Discrimination is a practice that comes about
because of prejudice. What is prejudice?
Syndicated columnist Walter Williams (who,
incidentally, is black) gives an_ interesting
definition of prejudice having to do with
limiting information costs.

Williams says that a non-discriminatory

 

person would put no value on_ information .

costs, and, therefore would seek to find out all
information before making a decision.

Williams uses the following example: What
if I were to walk outside and be greeted by a
Bengal tiger? I, being a discriminatory person
and knowing what I know about Bengal tigers
(that is, how they tend to be carnivorous,
big-toothed aggressors), I would immediately
run the other direction. My past information
has stereotyped this tiger so that I assume it
is like all other tigers, clearly an unfair
assumption.

If, however, I was a completely
non-discriminatory person, before making the
decision to run, I would first seek to gather
more information about this particular tiger.
Perhaps I would walk up to him and try to
pet him to see if he is really like other tigers.

Chances are I will be bitten. Clearly, in
this instance, discriminating against the tiger

would be to my advantage, even if it is unfair
to this tiger.

Now let’s look at it from the tiger’s point
of view. The tiger is also discriminating. If he
is hungry and sees a human in front of him,
he may decide, based on past experience, that
he wants or does not want to eat me. I, in
essence, will have been stereotyped by the
tiger as edible or not.

So, what does all this have to do with
fraternities at Washington and Lee?
Stereotypes that the rushors and the rushees
make are, in effect, discriminatory practices.

When I got to W&L, ‘“‘dirty rush’’ did not
apply to women. Any person could say
anything he or she wanted to a woman about

Fraternities that racially
discriminate are losing out
on fine students. Their right
to do so, however, is
unquestionable.

 

what fraternities were like. So, I learned that
X, Y, and Z were ‘‘geek houses’’ and not to
go to them. I learned that A, B, and C were
“southern houses’” and, being from (I almost
hate to admit it) New Jersey, not to go to
them. :
~eeSo I, as a ‘“‘rushee,’’ limited the houses to

g0-'-to. during - tush, thus limiting my’

information costs. As it turned out, J now
have friends in X, Y, Z and A, B, C, so the
‘dirty rush’’ advice was overcome in the end.
Not making friends at these houses
immediately did not really hurt me, and it did
help me decide what rush parties to attend (it
limited my information costs), so I can say
that my discrimination paid off.

But what about the rushors? They have to
limit the amount of people they rush, and so
they have to have criteria for evaluating the
freshmen, too. Here I like to make certain
assumptions about the nature of Washington
and Lee freshmen.

By virtue of their having being admitted
into the university, W&L freshmen must
possess a certain amount of intelligence.
After going through the E.C.’s honor lecture
during orientation, one could say they possess

\

«

Their right, their loss Hf

a certain respect for honor and W&L tradition. -

Knowing these things, by what standards

ought the fraternities evaluate students going ~

through rush?

be detected, anyway.

Well, let’s start with sex. Fraternities
discriminate against women. No one questions
their right to do so. What if we women stood
up and demanded equal access to fraternities?
People would think we were crazy. Instead,
we start sororities and eventually we will
make certain claims about how wonderful they

are, making them attractive for future women ,

to join.

How about region? I can name a few
houses that pride themselves on being
“‘southern.”’ Southern tradition is built into the
history of these fratemitics, in fact. So,
northern people don’t bother rushing southern
houses, and southern houses don’t bother
rushing northern freshmen.

Notice where this process could lead.
Southem houses could be losing out on
valuable scholars or athletes or genuinely fine
people. This is a chance those houses are
willing to take in the effort to have an
efficient rush.

Another criterion: social interaction. This
is the all-important being-able-to-work-your-
way-into-a-conversation-gracefully-and-not-be-
left-  standing-in-a-corner dilemma. Maybe
those people who prefer to stand in a corner
have a certain individualistic qualities that the
fraternity will lose out on by not extending
that person a bid.

So, what about race? Is it ‘‘fair’’ to limit
one’s information costs simply by the color of
one’s skin? I would say it is ‘‘fair,’’ but not
profitable. Fraternity houses are private clubs.
They may, and they do, discriminate on
whatever basis they like.

It is my opinion that fraternities that
racially discriminate are losing out on fine
students. To me, the cost of discrimination
on this basis is too high. Perhaps it would be
appropriate for them to examine why they
discriminate against blacks (do they blindly
accept stereotypes, or do they form their own
opinions from personal experience) before
doing so. Their right to do so, however, is in
my mind unquestionable.

Self-righteousness is a disease
which afflicts all of us to a greater
or lesser degree. Regardless of
whether or not we choose to
express ourselves, everyone
possesses an opinion on something
and it is human nature for us to
believe that we are right and those
who oppose our views are wrong.

We all feel free to act on our
opinions at some point, be it by
voting, donating money to a cause,
or even writing this column.

Ignorance is the enemy of
everyone who formulates opinions
on anything, and is the chief
contributor to self-righteousness.
An opinion infected by ignorance
is harmless until acted on, when it
can become a_ source of
embarrassment or worse, when
confronted with one more firmly
based in fact.

While watching TV with some
friends recently, I was bemoaning
the extensive amount of reading

my mouth. A fraternity brother’s
girlfriend then commented that she
had once donated a sum of money
to the Irish Republican Army.
Fresh from my readings and fairly
knowledgeable about the current
organization, 1 asked her why, to
which she replied, ‘*Because it’s
{meaning British-held Northern
Ireland] theirs [Ireland’s].’’ This
commonly-held misconception
accounts for the reason that the
IRA receives so much funding

 

from Irish-Americans.

The ostensible reason for the
existence of the IRA stems from
conflict over the partition of the
Emerald Isle in 1921, which left
six of her northern counties in the
United Kingdom while the rest
became the independent Free State.
The British government of David
Lloyd George arrived at this
solution after Anglo-Irish guerilla
warfare had reached a fever pitch
following World War I. A leading
force in this partisan war on the

The IRA _ that currently
terrorizes the British Isles (and
occasionally elsewhere) merits no
one’s money, much less an
American’s. Its most recent
incarnation, which cropped up in
the 1960s, demands an end to the
partition of the island, and the
return of Northern Ireland to unity
with the southern Irish government.
The partition, however, was not an
arbitrary event; it reflected a desire
of the majority of the inhabitants
of six counties to remain in union

 

Ignorance is the enemy of everyone

righteousness. And actions based on
ignorance can transform tainted opinions
into a regrettable gesture.

 

Irish side was a_ para-military
group known as the Irish
Republican Army. Although the
organization committed numerous
brutal murders (sometimes of
innocent civilian), a case can be
made that it was a_ legitimate
freedom fighting group in an
oppressed land. The establishment
of an independent Ireland put forth
the image of a romanticized, heroic
movement in the eyes of an Irish
people inured to a violent national
tradition. Included were _Irish-
Americans who  nostalgically
viewed the struggle from abroad.
This lingering perception shapes

with Britain, for economic and
political reasons. Chiefly, the
area’s industries were tied closely
to the U.K., while the Protestant
majority feared domination by the
Catholic south. Of course, no
partition enacted could be a perfect
one, but the British government did
see fit to allow three of the area's
sister counties (together the nine
make up Ulster, a historic unit) to
join the new free Ireland in 1921.
The inhabitants of Northern
Ireland, though Protestant, are as
Irish as anyone else, having lived
there for 350 years.

‘Because it’s theirs?’’ I don’t
think so.

The catalogue of IRA violence
since the 1960s is so vast that it
defies any kind of summary in this

space. Generally, an IRA strike
involves the murder of a couple of
British soldiers in Northern Ireland
or even England. Not infrequently,
though, the targets are or become
civilian. The IRA is by no means
unfamiliar with the killing of
innocent people, sometimes even
the Irish Catholics they are
supposedly fighting for.

Just last July, an IRA bomb
blast killed an  unoffending
Northern Irish couple and their six-
year-old son by accident. IRA
official Danny Morrison issued an
apology for the tragedy, which
certainly did the slain family a lot
of good. According to The New
York Times, at least 17 people
were mistakenly killed by the IRA
between November 1987 and
August 1988, including several
Roman Catholics.

Another IRA act of patriotic
freedom fighting in recent memory
was the December 1983 bombing
of Harrod’s, a London department
store. The blast killed five and
wounded 90, mostly shoppers.
Certainly, in part, the IRA scrves
as a convenient cloak for personal
grudges and the naturally violent.
Whatever their motivations, the
IRA is busy killing civilians with
bombs paid for in part by ill-
informed Americans.

The IRA would be committing
atrocities without American
donations, to be sure. And it is
certainly nice to hear that some
people care about their beliefs
enough to act on them in some
way. It is only when they don’t
really know what they believe or
why they believe it that actions
transform a tainted opinion into a
regrettable gesture.

Minorities visit W&L campus

 

By Brooke Jarabek
Staff Reporter

 

Minority students joined the
prospectives’ invasion of the
Washington and Lee campus today
as they were flown in for Minority
Student Visitation Weekend to
attend classes, interviews, and
experience the social scene at the
university.

One of the main events for the
minority recruits will be a panel
discussion featuring successful
alumni of W&L. The panel
includes a senior attomey general,
an attorney, a president of a
company, an accountant, and a vice
president of a bank.

William Grafton Young,

assistant director of admissions,
hopes to show the minority
prospectives that there is plenty of
opportunity for them at W&L.

“If you come here with a goal
in mind, you can be successful.
You can use the foundation

materials you gain from W&L to
be more successful in life,” said
Young.

He is proud to be able to tell
minority prospectives that W&L
students have elected minorities to
serve on the Executive Council and
as class officer.

Young wants to expose the
prospectives to all aspects of the
university’s environment. “We
want them to see with their eyes
wide open, knowing there is a very
small minority at this school.”’

The University of Maryland recently
announced that it will enforce its Code of
Academic Integrity in hopes of alleviating
problems with student dishonesty.

The president of UMD recently approved
an honor code, which is now being reviewed
by the UMD Board of Regents. Maryland’s
honor code will differ greatly from the W&L
Honor System.

When a Maryland student is caught
cheating academically, an XF will be placed
on their transcript to show that the student
committed academic fraud. The student has
the opportunity to participate in a six week
morality seminar, where white collar crime
and academic dishonesty cases will be
discussed,

According to Gary Pevela, College Park’s
director of judicial programs, one year after
the violation and after successful completion
of the morality seminar, the student can

The Honor Council, which will have a
student majority until its review in 1992, will
have the sole authority to remove the XF
from student transcripts. This will be the
only institution where students can make
changes on other students’ transcripts, said
Pavela.

UMD chose to place a mark indicating
academic fraud on the transcript rather than
automatically expelling a student, as W&L
does.

Pavela said, ‘“These are young people
whose values are being formed. The first-
time offender’s character is not set in stone
and we think it can be changed.

“‘We are keeping the role of proctoring
because of a much larger school body and a
non-residential location. We are making
academic integrity the joint responsibility of
students and faculty.”’

Joseph Fanning, a UMD freshman, said
that an Academic Integrity Code is a great
idea because ‘‘people shouldn’t be cheating.’’

According to W&L Executive Committee
President Christopher de Movellan, W&L has
not considered a system like that of the
University of Maryland.

“‘W&L is a school that, since Lee, has
prided itself on an individual’s autonomy and
the ability to make important decisions about
everything. With that autonomy comes great
responsibility and if the responsibilities aren’t
upheld then you bring certain penalties upon
yourself,

“A practical reason (that W&L would not
follow UMD’s example) is that our honor

system covers much more than the academic
realm,”’

Alston Parker, an EC member, agreed with
de Movellan. She said, ‘‘The University of

Maryland is inviting people to cheat. You
can cheat 10 times and if you get caught
once, then you go to a morality seminar. It’s
saying it’s okay to cheat until you get caught.
The philosophy of the W&L Honor System is
that you don’t measure honor in degrees.”’

This Saturday morning at 9
a.m. trout season opens.

Thousands of fishermen across
the state will crowd the banks of
local streams in search of the
elusive trout. Virginia has stocked
315,000 of them so far this year so
the fisherman will be excited to
begin.

Although some will set up their
lounge chair and cooler the night
before, most will arrive shortly
after daybreak to jockey for the
best spots. The good holes will be
completely surrounded by anglers
armed with cans of corn and tiny
jars of artificially colored salmon
eggs in various hues from yellow
to purple.

Inevitably, several lines will get
crossed right at the opening gun as
a dozen or so people try to get
their fuschia colored marshmallow
down to the trout first.

If you don’t have anything to
do, then go check it out--it is ‘‘All
American,”’ In Rockbridge County
the excitement can be found on
Irish Creek, Mill Creek, South
River, and the Goshen Pass
sections of the Maury River. A
complete state-wide list of all
stocked waters is in this month’s
Virginia Wildlife magazine in the
library.

from the action. I intend to spend
my day deep in the National Forest
fly-fishing for native brook trout,
or on waters which have been
restricted to single hook, artificial
lures only. If I choose my stream
carefully, then I may not see any
other fishermen besides the two or
three in my group. If I choose my
flies and fish carefully, then I may

. catch and release a good number

of trout.
Fishing with a fly is the most
logical way to fish for trout.

Trout do not normally eat corn
because it does not occur naturally
in their environment, and because
they are unable to digest it. Trout
eat insects and larvae which live in
the stream with them. The dry
flies and nymphs of fly-fishermen
imitate these aquatic insects in
size, shape and color. However,
the trick is to make the trout think
that your fly (usually made of bits
of fur and feathers) is actually a
meal.

Casting a fly seems strange at
first. Spin-fishermen throw their
lure at a spot and the weight of

the lure pulls the line behind it.
The fly rod throws the flyline,
which is made of thick plastic
coated line.

At the end of the line is a
section of tapered monofilament,
with a fly tied to the end. The
momentum of the forward cast of
the flyline carries the fly and the
monofilament beyond. the heavy
flyline, where it should gently
settle to the water.

Fly-fishing is more complicated
than spin-fishing, but it does not
have to be difficult. The extra
concentration and practice are more
than compensated for by the
rewards. If you have ever caught
a fish on a fly rod then you know
the feeling. If you have not but
would like to, please attend some
meetings of the new W&L
Flyfishing Club and learn
something about the sport.

For further details, contact
professor John McDaniel in his
office (463-8791) or Chris Brand
and David Lawrence at the Slug
Ranch (463-3384).

The club meets on Thursday
afternoons. The time and place of

Artist Katharine T. Carter will
present a slide-lecture on ‘‘Highlights
of the New York Art Season’’ on
Monday, March 20, at 8 p.m. in
duPont Hall. The lecture is open to
the public.

Carter, an active participant in the
New York art world, has developed
a series of annually updated slide
lectures that give her audiences a
comprehensive overview of the most
recent New York exhibition seasons.

In the presentation, slides are
shown of work being done in the
major art areas of painting, drawing,
sculpture, ceramic, photography and
printmaking. Relevant facts about the
professional background of each
artist, materials and technique, the
basic intent and theories underlying
the work, and the responses and
observations of the critics are
discussed.

 

DuPont exhibits

By Stephanie Smith
Staff Reporter

 

 

The artwork currently on display in duPont
Gallery by British artist Betsy Tyler Bell is a
combination of works inspired and created at
Washington and Lee during the past two months,
and a group of works on paper conceived at Bell’s
home in Oxford, England.

The exhibit’s opening was accompanied by a
performance piece choreographed by the artist and
adapted through a collaboration with Margaret
Brouwer, professor of music, and the fine arts
department. The piece was performed by W&L
fine arts students.

Bell said she feels that the artwork
‘encompasses her response to the world around
[her] in depicting the environment in a series of
fragments and fragmented images which evoke the
past, the present, and the future.’’

Series, are a complex method of relief printing
and transferred imagery; the four smaller works
are etchings and aquatints with color viscosity
printing, according to Bell.

Bell’s interest in the medium of handmade
paper derives from ‘“‘the built-in fragmented and
recycled nature.’ Remaining true to her medium,
the pieces Bell conceived at W&L are, she said,
“evolved mainly from fragmented materials
collected from faculty members.”’

The largest piece in the exhibition, titled
Reflections, is drawn directly from  Bell’s
“‘working, thought, and feelings about being at
Washington and Lee,”’

Bell is currently teaching a class at W&L in
papermaking. ‘“‘It is exciting to see how students
respond to material and have been able to change
their understanding of paper as an art medium and
not merely as a commodity to be used and
discarded,’’ Bell said.

Bell’s exhibit closes tomorrow evening.

Lady netters blank foes

 

By Beckwith Archer
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
women’s tennis team stormed
through its competition this past
week and, in the process, sent a
fearful message out to the teams in
the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference.

The Generals (6-1, 4-0 in the
ODAC) scored impressive 9-0
victories against five consecutive
opponents. That’s an individual
match record of 45-0, and the
Generals do not seem about to let
up on their competition.

The victims of the weekend
rampage were Virginia Wesleyan,
Randolph-Macon/Ashland and
Emory and Henry. The Generals,
playing on their home courts,
showed great tenacity and
concentration in sweeping the
singles competition 6-0 in each
match, and continuing to fight hard
though each team match was in the
proverbial bag. | None of the
singles matches was very close and
only one doubles match went to

“We came out ready to play
and we played very well,’ said co-
head coach David McLeod. ‘‘We
played hard every match. We
especially were keyed up for our
ODAC matches. We are placing a
lot of importance on our ODAC
matches this year.”’

On Tuesday afternoon, the
Generals went on the road to play
ODAC-rival Hollins. Despite
freezing weather conditions, W&L
was hot, burning Hollins by the
same 9-0 score. On Wednesday,
W&L grabbed an important ODAC
victory, defeating Mary Baldwin 9-
0 in Staunton. Mary Baldwin was
the team that nosed out W&L by
one-half point to win the ODAC
title last year.

The Generals have looked
strong all down the singles and
doubles line. Sophomores Jean
Stroman and Kelly Martone,
playing at No. 1 and 2 singles
respectively, have performed
extremely well. The Generals have
also picked up some excellent play
at No.’ 4 and 5 from two freshmen

runs in the first two innings to end
the game almost before it started.
Junior designated hitter Dave
Smith’s three-run __first-inning
homer was the decisive blow in
W&L’s eighteen-hit attack. Senior
catcher Eddie Klank had a pair of
two-run homers from his cleanup
spot, and his four RBIs tied Smith
for the team lead. Chris
Cunningham pitched five and 1/3
innings to gain the victory.

“I was surprised by _ the
homeruns. We jumped up on them
early, so we were able to hit-and-
run, steal and send guys to the
plate from second on singles.’’ said
Stickley. "Even against good
catchers, we have to keep running
to be successful. If it had been a
tight game we might not have been
able to...take chances."

Saturday was even better, as the
Generals got a pair of superb
pitching performances in _ the
double-header sweep. _ Freshman
Steve ‘Momorella’ pitched..a seven

defensive prowess surprised
Hathom, who had anticipated the
strength to come from the attack.

“Our attack players are more
experienced, but they need more
work than I expected,”’ she said.

Most important to the W&L
squad was the fact that the
Generals were able to be
competitive with Frostburg State.

“‘We had a sloppy stretch for
about 15 minutes that hurt us,”’
said Hathorn, whose team is
beginning its first year at the
varsity level. ‘‘Without that, we
could have kept the margin closer.

of how close the game really
was.”’

omfortto host night of song

Comfort, JubiLee, Sentinels, Charm, Sweet Tones and Octet to perform

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

Washington and Lee’s select
12-man singing ensemble, Southern
Comfort, will host the first annual
‘Evening with Southern Comfort
and  Friends’’ Thursday _ night,
March 24, at 8 p.m. in the
General’s Headquarters.

Joining Southern Comfort for
the evening of singing will be

JubiLee, the select women’s
ensemble from W&L, the VMI
Sentinels, Baldwin Charm from

Mary Baldwin, the Sweetones from
Sweet Briar and Comfort’s special

in Lexington next Thursday night.
Though each ensemble _ will
have its own unique style, each
will be rich in the musical tradition
of a capella singing. Some will
utilize extensive — choreography
while others will concentrate only
on music. Whatever the character
of any particular group, — the

evening promises to be a _ very
enjoyable experience.

For many years ensembles from
other schools have been coming to
W&L to join Southern Comfort in
concert, but never have this many
come at one time. Comfort student
leader Kevin Struthers said there had
been preliminary plans to hold the
concert in January but due to heavy
work and scheduling problems, the
concert had to be put on hold. Then,
about a month and a half ago,
Struthers learned that the Berkeley
Octet would be coming through and
saw the chance to put together an in-
credible evening of music.

Southern Comfort was founded

For new cuisine, go Down

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

For anyone looking for a new
dining experience, why not go
Down Under? No, you don’t
have to go to Australia. You just
have to go 16 Lee Avenue here
in Lexington to try the newest
cuisine in town.

The new Down Under
restaurant and sandwich shop was
pened three weeks ago by local den-
list Dr. Richard Hull in the
old Subway Sandwich Shop
location ‘‘down under’’ the street
on Lee Avenue. Hull, who serves
as the District Chairman and
Vice-President of the Stonewall
fackson area council for the Boy
Scouts of America, said he got
the idea to open the restaurant
last year when he took 120 Boy
Scouts from Virginia to the
World Boy Scout Jamboree in
\ustralia. Hull said he loved
\ustralia so much that he decided
‘Oo. open a restaurant in the
\ustralian motif here in
Lexington,

Australian decorations, but the

apart from others in town don’t
stop there.

Down Under retains the basic
shape of the old Subway Shop
but is much brighter. The brick
walls have been painted white
and the floor sky blue. Ceiling
fans and small spotlights on the
side walls have been added as
well as a gas burning stove that
makes the small restaurant kink
of homelike.

The walls feature wooden
plaques of the Australian
continent as well as kangaroos of
different sizes all painted with
indigo blue paint. Pictures and
posters from the — various
America’s Cup races hang on the
walls as well as pictures of Paul
Hogan and Linda Kozlowski from
the Crocodile Dundee films.
“No Swimming - Crocodile
Crossing’? and ‘‘Last Pub - 897
km’’ signs also adom various
walls. One interesting feature is a

about the food?

The Down Under menu features
mainly deli sandwiches, but has
different kinds of pizza, salads
and soups as well. All of the deli
meats come from the Thumann
Meat Company in New York; the
company that Hull says supplies
all of New York’s finest delis
with their meat products.

The waitresses at Down Under
as well as other people I have
talked to who have eaten at the
new restaurant suggest that the
‘*Tasmanian Devil’’, a hot ham,
pastrami and turkey sandwich and
theSoutk Pacific= Piz’, a
pizza with tomato sauce, two
layers of cheese, canadian bacon
and pineapple on it have been the
favorite foods so far. Personally,
I have had the Pastrami and
Cheese sub and the South Pacific
Pizza and both were very gcod.
The pizza is a different, light
taste but one I think most people
will enjoy.

The restaurant serves both
imported beer such as Red Stipe,
Heineken, Lowenbrau, Molson
and Amstel Light as well as
domestic beer such as Bud,

promises to be both enjoyable and
exciting. The concert is free of
admission and is open to anyone
who wishes to come. The concert
should start shortly after eight, but
due to limited seating in the GHQ,
those attending the concert are
urged to come a little early. Early
or late, don’t miss out on this very
special evening of music with
Southern Comfort and Friends.

The restaurant runs a_ special

wecks. More than anything
though, the people at own

Under want you to come ty the
cuisine and tell them what they
can do to improve the new
restaurant.

‘*We are open, we have carry out
and we deliver,’’ said Hull.

“‘We will try to meet your needs
while serving you first quality
food. We want you to make
suggestions and tell us what we
can do better.”’

Down Under is open seven
days a week and will deliver
from 11 am. to 2 p.m. every

‘Men take 8th in NCAAs

 

,

, By Mike Shady
‘Sports Editor

é

When Washington and Lee’s
‘David Olson stepped up to the
starting blocks for the
,championship heat of the 200-yard
‘packstroke at last week’s Division
_/lll Men’s Swimming National
~ Championships, his mental
“processes were in overdrive.

* One of the favorites in the
,competition, Olson was preparing
himself much the same way
‘baseball players or high jumpers
«get ready to hit a pitch or clear a
bar, through positive mental
‘imagery.

« “I ty to picture the. race,”
Olson said. “‘I try to plan how
‘I'm going to swim the race. I
‘knew [prior to the heat] who was
«going to be there and that it was
going to be tough. I just wanted
‘to swim my race and not make
yany mistakes.’

He didn’t. Olson led from
‘start to finish in the 200 back,
rshattering his own school record
ywith a time of 1:53.14 and
becoming W&L’s first individual
‘national champion since 1977 and
,the school’s third overall.

The junior also earned NCAA D-
‘III All-America status five times
«during the championships, en route

 

to leading the Generals to an
eighth-place finish in the final team
standings. W&L scored 170
points, three points behind seventh-
place Denison and 16 points ahead
of ninth-place Johns Hopkins.
Kenyon won its 10th straight
national title, finishing with a team
total of 630.5 points.

After all the swimming was
completed, Olson swam away with
All-America honors in five events:
the 200 back, the 200 individual
medley, the 100 back, the 200
medley relay and the 400 medley

relay.
But Olson was not the only
General to ‘shine at the

championships held at Bowdoin
College in Brunswick, Maine.
W&L received All-America (first
through eighth place) or Honorable
Mention - All-America (ninth
through 16th place) from six other
individuals. Senior Jeff Bercaw in
the 100 butterfly (15th), junior
Shawn Copeland in the 200
breaststroke (12th) and freshman
Jay Smith in the 100 freestyle
(14th) were W&L’s other
individual stars.

As for the relays, the All-
America 200 and 400 medley relay

teams (eighth and _— seventh

respectively) consisted of Olson,
Bercaw, Copeland and Smith; the

400 free relay team (fifth) was
made up of Bercaw, Smith, senior
captain David Reavy and freshman
Chip Nordhoff; the 800 free relay
team (eighth) was Copeland,
Reavy, Nordhoff and sophomore
Jim Dunlevy; and the 200 free
relay team (12th) was comprised of
Reavy, Bercaw, Smith and
Nordhoff.

Senior David Dietz had to leave
the championships after Thursday
moming’s competition for personal
reasons.

‘‘We pulled together as a team,”
said Reavy. ‘‘It was a total team
effort.”’

John Hudson, who won both the
500- and 1650-yard freestyle events
at the 1976 NCAA D-III National
Championships, is W&L’s only
other individual national swimming
champion. Olson is the third
W&L athlete ever to earn an
individual national crown. The
only other individual D-III national
champion in the school’s history
was the men’s tennis doubles team
of Stewart Jackson and Ben Johns,
which won the D-III national
doubles title in 1977.

W&L’s eighth-place team finish
tied the best ever performance at
nationals for a W&L swimming

team. The Generals came in

championships.

Investigation

No suspects have been found in
the continuing investigation of the
hit-and-run accident that killed
freshman Mary Ashley
Scarborough last Thursday,
according to Lexington Police
Chief Bruce Beard.

Beard said the only evidence
found at the scene was a_ horn
cover from the underside of the
front bumper of a 1987 metallic
blue Honda Accord.

Paint samples found on
Scarborough’s clothing are being
analyzed to determine the exact
color of the car that hit her, and
the results should be known by
Friday, Beard said.

An autopsy has been performed
to determine the exact ‘‘blow of
the body that killed her,’’ said
Beard, but the results will not be
released until a later date. He said
the main reason for the autopsy
was that the police ‘‘don’t know

Scarborough’s body was found ‘25

weekend was, "Are we human

The ethics institute, an annual
event in the pre-professional ethics
program at W&L, was attended by
prominent journalists from such
organizations as the AP, ABC and
CBS.

Hodges, who organizes the
institutes in’ each of the applied
ethics programs of medicine, law,
business and journalism, initially
contacted Rice through Bruce
Sanford, one of the top privacy
lawyers in the country, who also
knows Rice. Hodges spoke with
Rice in January and extended to
her an invitation to speak at the
Saturday afternoon session, which
would address privacy and the law,
he said.

EC actions
questioned
by report

By Henry Ferris
Staff Reporter

 

 

Although it has yet to be
officially presented, a new report
has been released that is causing a
str in the Executive Committee
office.

Led by Anne Schroer-Lamont,
associate dean of students, the
Self-Study Committee on Student
Activities recently completed a
report that criticized several
Executive Committee practices.
These criticisms included the belief
that the EC may have too many
responsibilities which hinder them
from operating effectively, and that
there is an irregular allocation of
EC funds to many student groups.

The self-study committee has
recommended several changes for
next year. It asks that the EC
create written policies outlining
which groups qualify for EC funds,
and that all student organizations
be organized under umbrella
groups according to their related

— i functions. Finally, the report states
' , that the EC should be given an

Student Executive Committee.
Three weeks ago, second-year law
student Hugh Finkelstein and
sophomore’ Willard Dumas
campaigned for student body
president and vice-president on the
platform that the EC _ needed
written guidelines for allocating
funds.

“Currently the EC refuses
funding to political, religious and
social groups that do not represent
the student body as a whole,”’ said
Dumas. He added that because no
written guidelines exist, it comes
down to the opinion of the
Executive Committee on who does

Don’t canonize Duke’s opponents -

 

MY VIEW
By Charles Gay

 

Seldom has a local election
commanded national attention the
way that the race for a seat in the
Louisiana state legislature did last
month. The victory of a former
Grand Wizard of the Knights of.
the Ku Klux Klan in_ the
predominantly white New Orleans
suburb of Metaire has raised a
storm of outrage among journalists,
black leaders, and the Republican
Party, whose banner David Duke
ran under. Duke calls for an end
to affirmative action and a
reassertion of white rights, appeals
for which he is branded with the
moral-political leprosy -- racism.
However, many of Duke’s
adversaries have considerably less
lofty motives for attacking him.

Although Duke’s_ past
associations with the Klan and a
neo-Nazi group were undeniably
racist, his current rhetoric is mild.
Affirmative action and minority
set-aside programs are his chief
targets. Presumably, programs like
affirmative action are designed to

in fact victims themselves of

has succumbed to the lobbying of
minorities in instituting
black/minority-favoring programs,
Duke mentions that men _ like
himself must step forward to assert

only a power struggle between
rival groups.  That’s why it’s

Black politicians and other

leaders are bound to oppose Duke,
because their black constituency
demands that they do, and because
they would fall from grace if they
delayed a second. Still, there is a
more elemental reason--the power

Duke calls for an end

Duke’s opponents find a
convenient weapon with which to
assault him, the brand of ‘‘racist.”’
If they call ‘“‘racist’’ on Duke
many people will deem him

The real Rice

 

MY VIEW
By Rob MacPherson

 

Rare is a Saturday afternoon in
Lexington when one gets the
chance to have a drink with a
young lady who played a major
role in the demise of a presidential

candidate; however, such an
opportunity presented itself to
several Washington and Lee

students this past weekend, myself
included.

Donna Rice, the “‘model/actress/
partygirl’’ whose infamous
rendezvous with Gary Hart forced
him to withdraw from the 1988
presidential campaign, spent a few
hours last Saturday telling students,
faculty, lawyers and _ professional
journalists how the conduct of the
latter caused her to go from being
a sales representative with a
pharmaceutical company to a
volunteer with a non-profit
organization.

Also, in order to operate in her
present societal capacity without
being hounded by the media, she
occasionally (and not because she
likes the fit) sports false buck teeth
and... sunglasses to alter her
appearance. Basically, as a result
of press coverage of an isolated
incident in which she herself was
not the thrust of the story, Donna

Rice has been denied the
unalienable right to pursue
happiness.

A. major topic of discussion
during the 15th Annual Institute on
the Ethics of Journalism at
Washington and Lee University,
the event which prompted Miss
Rice’s surprise visit to the Big
Lex, was an individual’s right to
privacy and the consequences that
often result from its constant clash
with the First Amendment, which
guarantees freedom of the press.
The clash occurs because neither
of the parties involved, the public
and the press, wants to forfeit any
of the benefits they enjoy from the
current arrangement of coexistence.

At the institute, Miss Rice
served as a living example of what
can result from _ irresponsible
journalism. Because of the way
she was treated in the media, she
lives her life according to what she
can get away with, without having

to hold a press conference at every
street comer. She has tried to tell
her story and clear her name, but
each attempt has done nothing to
change the false public perception
of this Phi Beta Kappa student
who many have been told is a
mere ‘‘model/actress/partygirl.”’

It is not the fault of society
that the name Donna Rice often
makes people think of the word
‘‘bimbo.”’ Nor is it the fault of
Miss Rice. After all, she is well
educated and has already shown
that she can be a_ successful
‘‘woman of the ‘80s.”’ The fault
rests in the hands of the media and
those journalists who routinely
abuse the power of the press. A
fair assessment of the woman who
is blamed for ruining Gary Hart’s
political career would be to
describe her as what she is, not
what the media thinks the public
wants to see, hear and read.

If I had never met Donna Rice,
I would be among the many who,
almost two years after she was in
the limelight, still believe she got
what she deserved. Having met
her, I can plead ignorance for
arriving at my previously held
beliefs. I was merely reacting to
what I was told by the mighty
media in whom I had placed a
great deal of trust and of whom I
expected nothing but complete
accuracy.

Was I wrong to think that I
could turn to the media for an
authentic view of the world around
me? Being a journalism major,
I’m inclined to say ‘‘no.’’ Were
the media wrong for painting me a
picture of my world which did not
tell the whole story? Being a
human being, I’m inclined to say
“tyes.’” I do not believe Donna
Rice is a saint and the press
should be damned for having
introduced her to us. Rather, I
firmly believe that her behavior in
1987 warranted press coverage,
especially when one considers with
whom she was sharing moonlit
evenings. My point is that I
should not have to meet such a

another pretty face’’ nor should it
take two years for this information
to surface. One should not feel

to deliver the whole story. After
all, what else is there?

i obs
Mil

thn

at their disposal, the bigotry tag.
Attempting to battle Duke on the
grounds of his current rhetoric
would be too risky and more
difficult, so black politicians
merely cry ‘‘Klan’’ and the
moralists/idealists are in their back
pockets. Just prior to Duke’s
being sworn into office in Baton
Rouge two of the state’s black
representatives walked out on the
legislature, swearing not to come
back until Duke was somehow

silenced...- If--that*s- not~ an -appeal .

‘

¢

for a political monopoly, then what
could be? :

The Republican Party, which
publicly condemned Duke as ‘‘not
a Republican in gesture, deed, or
belief’’ at the end of February, !tas
tried .to shroud its opposition ,to
Duke in patriotic as well as moral
garb. Republican _ national
chairman Lee Atwater piously
condemned Duke as unworthy of
“the party of Abraham Lincoln
and George Bush (!)’’ labelling
him ‘‘an enemy of America.”
Atwater neglected to mention his
campaign to bring more black
voters into the Republican Party,
and the fact that Duke’s association
with the party would probably
damage his chances. The political
angle of the issue was belied by
the fact that President Bush
publicly and strenuously endorsed
Duke’s opponent in the election
race, which is virtually unheard of
in such a small-scale campaign.
Why else would the Republican
Party be so interested? it
obviously feared that Duke would
drive away potential voters from
the party at large.

The victory of David Duke in a
Louisiana state legislature race was
too minor an event for so man
people to get so upset about it.
Clearly, Duke’s opponents have
found it convenient to ignore the
issues and make themselves look
good by condemning him, all ih
the name of some ‘‘higher ideals.’;

_ According to Worth, grief over a death of a
friend or peer is a very disruptive period for an
individual. He said, “‘It’s a time when people do
things they don’t normally do.

“‘Some people cry, some are withdrawn, some
analyze the situation and others don’t get any sleep.
There’s no one way to deal [with grief).””

According to Worth, there are three stages a
person goes through in the grieving process. The
first phase is disbelief that death has occurred and
the second is a reaction to the death: Worth said
each person reacts different'y, but the key
component in this phase is anger. He said
community support services can be invaluable during
this time.

The third phase in the grieving process is
acceptance, Worth said. He said the initial feelings
of shock and anger are replaced by an appreciation
of the person who died. He also said a deeper
awareness of life or the recognition of life as

The recent death of a freshman in a hit-and-run
accident in Lexington has rocked the W&L campus.

At the time of the accident, both university
psychologists, Dr. James Worth and Anne Schroer-
Lamont, were out of town attending confebences.
However, according to Worth, the Southern
Seminary counselor, Molly Messimen, was called at
7 a.m. on Thursday and spent 20 hours of her own
time talking to W&L deans and students who
needed an ear. Worth said Messimen interned at
W&L under his direction.

Asked why the university was ‘‘hit very hard’’
by the tragedy, Worth said it came at a bad time,
before exams, in ‘‘crummy’’ weather and the
violent, pointless nature of the accident made people
think twice about the situation. He also said that
since the accident occurred in a place that so many
people pass, makes them think it could have been

Barefeet and grass.
A ham sandwich,
An early moming drive.

Simple pleasures. In the world of Al McGuire,
simple pleasures are what life is all about. The NBC
broadcaster and former head basketball coach
emphasized the importance of this ideal to an
estimated crowd of 300 students last Thursday night
in Lee Chapel.

He also stressed the necessity of dreaming.

“Whatever you want to do you can do,” said
McGuire, whose Marquette team won the NCAA
Division I men’s basketball championship in 1977,
his final season as head coach. ‘‘You have to do
your work, but your dreams -- they can come true.

“To this day I dream. I always wanted to be a

coach. I’m telling you, whatever you dream will
become a reality. Like who you are, be yourself
and dream.”

McGuire drifted from subject to subject, mainly
because he doesn’t use notes but ‘“‘works by
wristwatch.’’ He often lost his train of thought but
he never lost his hypnotic power and control over
the audience. His talk was extremely informal,
almost as if Lee Chapel were a big living room and
McGuire had come over to sit on the couch and
chat for a while about life and college basketball.
All that was missing was the fire in the fireplace.

Because he talks ‘‘in pictures, not in words,”’
McGuire’s speech, if you want to call it that, does
not allow itself to be easily paraphrased. Instead, it
was similar to a philosopher stating his views on the
meaning of life. So, here are Al McGuire’s views
on:

-The Bill Frieder/Michigan situation. ‘‘You
have to realize that, in life, a person must take an
opportunity in life when it comes along. Arizona
State is in the minus pool, they don’t have anything,
and I guess they had to make a move because they
can’t miss this freshman class completely. There’s a

m@ Have a ham sandwich on Al

time to move on. I think the ideal thing in the
coaching profession is that every five years a coach
changes jobs.”’

-The NCAA’s policy not allowing an athlete,
who has signed a letter of intent for one school,
to transfer after learning that school’s coach has
left without losing a year of eligibility. ‘‘The
NCAA is wrong on that. If a head coach leaves,
nobody [Frieder] recruited should be allowed to go
to Arizona State with him, but the ball players he
has signed should be allowed to go to any school
that they have visited. A ball player can visit five
schools. Allow that young gentleman or that young
lady to visit one more school, and then make a pick
of those five schools to go to. You do go to a
university a lot of times because of the coach and
his style of play.’’

-The alleged bias toward big conferences when
selecting teams for the NCAA tournament. ‘“‘I
think that each conference should not be allowed to
put in more than four teams, with the exception that
one of the bottom teams wins the post season

conference tournament. We're building super
conferences and we’re not spreading the wealth
around.,”’

-Proposition 48 and 42. “They are not

discriminatory, in my opinion. I think the testing is
discriminatory, as far as not only to minorities but
also regional. I think there are other parts of the
country that can’t qualify academically to that
standard. I still think Proposition 42 will fly
through. I think this was an overreaction because of
John Thompson. I believe you are supposed to use
sports, not let sports use you.’’

-The best player ever. ‘‘The best player who
ever played the game is Kareem Adbul-Jabbar. The
best player ever, pound for pound, was the Big O,
Oscar Robertson.”’

-The top 5 NBA lottery picks. 1)Pervis Ellison,
Louisville; 2)Danny Ferry, Duke; 3)Stacey King,
Oklahoma; 4)Sean Elliot, Arizona; and 5)Tom
Hammonds, Georgia Tech.

-Life. ‘‘Give people a chance. Communicate.
Without talking you aren’t going any place in your
life. Life’s a piece of cake. For you to blow your
lives is insanity.”’

Previewing the 1989 Oscars

Rain Man and Dangerous Liaisons look for big wins

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

When one considers the thousands of
elements that go into creating a motion
picture, it is truly amazing that any are ever
completed. Like a child, a film starts small
and miraculously grows into something that
can exist without the support of those who
created it. It is from that point forward that
the world begins to judge and to decide who
or which is the strongest and who or which is
the weakest.

In the world of motion pictures, the finest
films, actors, actresses, technicians, musicians
and directors of 1988 have been chosen and
Geemed worthy of an award nomination from
the American Motion Picture Academy of Arts
and Sciences. It is now time to decide who or
what is the absolute best.

After coming off somewhat weak film
years in 1986 and 1987, 1988 proved to be
the finest year for film since 1984 when A
Passage to India, The Killing Fields, Places
in the Heart and A Soldier’s Story lost out
to Amadeus for Best Picture.

The quality films in 1988 showcased many
ol Hollywood’s finest professionals but also
introduced a plethora of new faces and styles,
Looking at the 20 nominations in the four
acting categories for instance, 12 are first-time
nominations- new faces and new talent. On
the other hand, the 25 men and women
nominated for acting and directing oscars
already have 47 nominations and seven awards
between them.

There is of course a down side to all of
this and that is that in only giving five
nominations in each category, some people
had :to be left out. People like Penny Marshall
(Big), Stephen Frears (Dangerous Liaisons)
and’ Clint Eastwood (Bird) in the direction
category, William Hurt (The Accidental
Tourist), Bob Hoskins (Who Framed Roger
Rabbit?), Forest Whitaker (Bird) and John
Malkovich (Liaisons) in the acting categories,
and Elizabeth Perkins (Big), Tim Robbins,
Kevin Costner and Susan Sarandon (Bull
Durham) in the supporting categories all
delivered excellent performances but were left
out.

The lines have been drawn though and
now it is time to move on to the nominees
for this year’s 61st annual Academy Awards
ceremony. Since there are some discrepancies
between who the academy will give the
awards to and who I think deserves them, the
TUG’S TAG choices that I will make in each
of the categories will be my predictions of the
choices I think the academy will make.

First, the minor awards.

Best Costume Design

The nominees are: Coming to America,
Dangerous Liaisons, A Handful of Dust,
Sunset and Tucker: The Man and His
Dream,

I don’t see how the academy can give it to
any film but Dangerous Liaisons. The film’s
eighteenth century costumes were breathtaking
in both their apparent authenticity and in their
fine detail. This one shouldn’t be tough to
pick.

Tug’s Tag: Dangerous Liaisons

Best Visual Effects
The nominees are: Die Hard, Who Framed
Roger Rabbit? and Willow.

I said it in September and I still believe it
If Roger Rabbit doesn’t win this award there
is no justice in the world. Robert Zemeckis
and the rest of the crew who put animation
and live action together so effectively deserve
every visual award they are up for.
Tug’s Tag: Who Framed Roger Rabbit?

Best Cinematography

The nominees are: Peter Biziou, Mississippi
Burning, Dean Cundey, Who Framed Roger
Rabbit?, Conrad L. Hall, Tequila Sunrise,
Sven Nykvist, The Unbearable Lightness of
Being and John Searle, Rain Man.

This one is a tough call. The man I
wanted to give’.the Oscar to was the
cinematographer who shot Tucker. In my
mind that was the finest cinematic
achievement of the year but he wasn’t
nominated. Still, the five nominated are all
excellent. Searle and Cundey have the inside
track but Biziou and even Nykvist have
outside shots.

Tug’s Tag: John Searle, Rain Man.

Best Foreign Language Film
The nominees are: Hanussen (Hungary), The
Music Teacher (Belgium), Pelle the
Conquerer (Denmark), Salaam Bombay!
(India) and Women on the Verge of a
Nervous Breakdown, (Spain).

Since I don’t have a chance to see foreign
films very often I usually pick the film that
has gotten the most positive response from the

critics, but last year I got burned. This year,
Max von Sydow’s Best Actor nomination will
help the plight of Pelle, but I’m going to go
with a gut feeling.

Tug’s Tag: Women on the Verge, (Spain)

Best Original Screenplay

The nominees are: Ronald Bass and Barry
Morrow, Rain Man, John Cleese and Charles
Crichton, A Fish Called Wanda, Naomi
Foner, Running on Empty, Gary Ross and
Anne Spielberg, Big and Ron Shelton, Bull
Durham.

This is another tough category to call. All
of the screenplays were excellent but in the
end I think Rain Man’s popularity and
acceptance in the film circles will be too
much for the other nominees. Any way you
cut it, it will be close.

Tug’s Tag: Ross and Morrow, Rain Man

Best Adapted Screenplay

The nominees are: Jean-Claude Carriere and
Philip Kaufman, The Unbearable Lightness
of Being, Christine Edzard, Little Dorrit,
Frank Galati and Lawrence Kasdan, The
Accidental Tourist, Christopher Hampton,
Dangerous Liaisons and Hamilton Phelan and
Tab Murphy, Gorillas in the Mist.

In my mind, Christopher Hampton deserves
this award far and away. I have never read
Hampton’s original play ‘‘Les Liaisons
Dangereuses’’ from which Dangerous
Liaisons is taken, but assuming it is
somewhat close to the screenplay, it is nothing
short of brilliant writing.

Tug’s Tag: Christopher Hampton, Dangerous
Liaisons

And now for the major awards,
Best Director
The nominees are: Charles Crichton, A Fish
Called Wanda, Barry Levinson, Rain Man,
Mike Nichols, Working Girl, Alan Parker,
Mississippi Burning and Martin Scorsese,
The Last Temptations of Christ.

Crichton and Nichols did wonderful jobs
with their films, but it is not very often that a
director can pull this award without having a
Best Picture contender which neither man has.
I think Scorsese’s nomination is just the
academy’s way of saying they support him for
making such a controversial film. That leaves
Parker and Levinson and in all senses, Barry
Levinson’s direction and film are clearly that
much better than Parker’s. Since the Oscars
began in 1927 the Best Director award and
the Best Picture award have coincided 45 of
60 times and 16 of 18 times since 1970. This
year will be no different.

Tug’s Tag: Barry Levinson, Rain Man

Best Supporting Actress

The nominees are: Joan Cusack, Working
Girl, Geena Davis, The Accidental Tourist,
Frances McDormand, Mississippi Burning,
Michelle Pfeiffer, Dangerous Liaisons and
Sigourney Weaver, Working Girl.

This category poses an interesting question
for the academy. For only the sixth time in its
history, the academy gave a _ double
nomination this year to Sigoumey Weaver. In
the Best Actress category she is probably a
clear fourth. Do you give her the Oscar to
make up for the actress award. No, you don’t.
The Academy on the other hand might. My
vote goes to Geena Davis who gave what I
thought was the best female supporting
performance nominated. Had Susan Sarandon
been nominated for Bull Durham I think she
might have gotten my vote, but of the women
nominated Davis is the best. If she doesn’t get
it, I think Michelle Pfeiffer will. It’s a tough
call.

Tug’s Tag: Geena Davis, The Accidental

Tourist

Best Supporting Actor
The nominees are: Alec Guiness, Little
Dorrit, Kevin Kline, A Fish Called Wanda,
Martin Landau, Tucker: The Man and His
Dream, River Phoenix, Running on Empty
and Dean Stockwell, Married to the Mob.
This category is hard for me to call
because I haven’t seen two of the films.
Unfortunately, they are the two most in
contention. River Phoenix has gotten rave
reviews about his part in Running on Empty
and recently won the National Board of
Review Best Supporting Actor award. On the
other hand, Stockwell won awards from the
New York Film Critics Circle and from The
National Society of Film Critics while Guiness
won the award from the Los Angeles Film
Critics Association. This category seems to be
wide open. I like Martin Landau and thought
his portrayal of Jeff Bridges uncle/partner in
Tucker was wonderful. This one is too close
to call.

Best Actress
+The nominees are: Glenn Close, Dangerous
Liaisons, Jodie Foster, The Accused, Melanie
Griffith, Working Girl, Meryl Streep, A Cry
in the Dark and Sigourney Weaver, Gorillas
in the Mist.

This category should be sticky but it won't
be. In my mind the best female performance
of the year came from Jodie Foster. Her
portrayal of the rape victim in The Accused
was both touching and believable; a
combination not easy to achieve. Unfortunately
she won’t win the award this year.

Many times, as in the cases of Henry
Fonda in 1981, Geraldine Page in 1986 and
Paul Newman in 1987, the academy seems to
award obligatory Oscars to actors who have
received numerous nominations over the years
but who have never won. This year, Glenn
Close gave a fantastic performance in
Dangerous Liaisons and whether it was the
best of the year or not, she will win the
award because it’s her fifth try, she’s never
won and she’s so close.

Tug’s Tag: Glenn Close, Dangerous Liaisons

Best Actor

The nominees are: Gene Hackman,
Mississippi Burning, Tom Hanks, Big, Dustin
Hoffman, Rain Man, Edward James Olmos,
Stand and Deliver and Max von Sydow,
Pelle the Conquerer.

Like the Best Actress category it is a
shame that all five men can’t win because
they all gave excellent performances. Unlike
the Best Actor category, however, there was
not an actress who stood head and shoulders
above the rest like Dustin Hoffman did in the
Best Actor category. There is absolutely no
way the academy can justify not giving
Hoffman the award. I’m very glad the
academy gave Max von Sydow a nomination
after so many years of wonderful work with
Ingmar Bergman, but they cannot give him
the award as a career twilight highlight. As
Raymond Babbit in Rain Man, Hoffman gave
what I think time will consider one of the
finest performances of the decade. Hackman,
Hanks, von Sydow and Olmns all gave
excellent performances but there is no
question here.

Tug’s Tag: Dustin Hoffman, Rain Man

Best Picture

The nominees are: ‘The Accidental Tourist,
Dangerous Liaisons; , Mississippi Burning,
Rain Man and Working Girl.

As stated earlier, not since 1984 has the
decision for best picture been this difficult to
make. I eliminate Working Girl right off the
bat because as I said in my review of it, the
film is just a remake of The Secret of my
Success with a bigger, role-reversed cast. I
was also fairly unimpressed and somewhat
bored with Mississippi Burning and don’t
really think it can be considered.

That leaves Tourist, Rain Man and
Liaisons. To be perfectly honest I thought
each of these films was incredibly well done
and a thrill to watch. Each has its forte;
Tourist the feel, Rain Man _ Hoffman’s
performance and Liaisons the _ brilliant
screenplay from Hampton. Yet, each of these
films has more than just its individual forte
and that’s why they are 1988’s finest three
films.

As far deciding the best film, Liaisons is
brilliant but still comes off as a play in
cinematic form and because of that is slightly
tainted. Rain Man is brilliant as well but
possibly relies too much on the mastery of
Hoffman’s performance. I’m afraid if you take
part of the intensity’ away from _ the
performance the film loses some of its bite.
The Accidental Tourist as I said two weeks
ago would be my choice for Best Picture. In
choosing a Best Picture, I think one must look
at how all the elements work together.
Tourist puts them all together in a perfectly
balance package. The acting, the
cinematography, the story and the screenplay
are all consistent and never dominate each
other making for a very smooth and coherent
film. Regardless of my wishes however, I
think Hoffman’s performance will be enough
to give Rain Man the award.

The W&L Spectator was
discussed at a special meeting of
the Executive Committee on
Thursday, April 26, and the
Liberty Hall Volunteers, a
telegram to Chinese student
protestors, the policy for the

distribution of grade change sheets
and missing dining hall utensils
were discussed at the Monday,

May 1 meeting of the EC.
During last Monday’s EC
meeting, sophomores Paul

Lagarde, Ray Welder and Claude
Williams presented plans for the
Spectator, a new _ student
publication. Lagarde, Welder and
Williams are seeking to provide a
forum for "enlightened discourse"

on ideas and issues involving
W&L, as well as on national and
international events. The group
petitionéd the EC for $700 needed
to cover the cost of printing the
first issue, to be released this
month. However, the provisional
approval the Publications Board
granted the Spectator lead the EC
to table the petition. The EC
sought a_ clarification of the
meaning of "provisional approval.”
Normally, the EC releases funds
only after the board has granted
the board an _ unconditional

SPCA seeks larger shelter

Overcrowding forcing animals to be euthanized

 

By Alesha Priebe
Staff Reporter

The Rockbridge Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
has found a possible site for a
new shelter, SPCA chairman Mrs.
Kenneth Cornett said.

A four-acre area of land on
Route 39 near the county jail is
currently being considered for pur-
chase. A $200,000 building has
been proposed to house the stray
and unwanted animals that are
now crowded in the shelter on
Campbell Lane in Lexington.

The current shelter is 25 years
old, too small and is ‘‘falling
apart,” according to Cornett.
During the recent heavy
rainstorms, water poured through a
hole in the roof,

The Best Seller has solved its
space problem.

Beth Thompson, _ the
bookstore’s manager, said, ‘‘We
were just running out of space and
luckily the store next door became
available.”’ But she said, ‘‘It’s
really a little too early to tell’’ if
the expansion into the former Flip
Side music store has helped busi-
ness.

Thompson has _ been the
bookselling business since 1975
when she returned to Rockbridge

The Campbell Lane _ shelter
has nine dog runs, indoor cages
with access to outdoor cages, and
10 cat cages, but the shelter is
currently housing 19 dogs and 23
cats,

Cornett said the small space
causes disease spreading and limits
the amount of time the shelter can
keep an animal before euthanizing
it. Right now, an animal is kept
an average of 5-14 days before it
must be put to sleep. Comett said
20 percent of the animals brought
to the shelter will be adopted.
The other 80 percent are put to
sleep. The Humane Society of the
United States reported that 12 mil-
lion animals end up in shelters
every year. Eight million of those
are euthanized.

The proposed shelter would

have 22 to 25 dog runs and 20
cat cages, allowing more animals
to be housed for a longer period
of time. It would be less noisy
than the Campbell Lane area and
would provide better health condi-
tions for the animals, Cornett said.

During 1988, 1,455 cats and
dogs were brought to the
Rockbridge SPCA shelter. That is
four times the number of animals
brought to the shelter 25 years
ago.

“We simply don’t have the
room for so many animals. That’s
why the new shelter is so impor-
tant to us,’ Cornett said.

Omicron Delta Kappa has
named seven new initiates and
John Fialcowitz will be the recipi-
ent of ODK’s sophomore-of-the-
year award. ,

According to senior Moose
Herring, W&L’s ODK president,
the initiates were named to give
the juniors already inducted a
larger membership body for next
year.

ODK is a national leadership
honor society founded December
3, 1914, at W&L. It was organ-
ized by fifteen student and faculty
leaders in the legacy of the ideal-
ism and leadership of George
Washington and Robert E. Lee.

The new initiates, all juniors,
are George Wesley Boyd, Jennifer
E. Spreng, Tomas Andrew
Brubaker, Kevin M. Nash, Robert
K. Tompkins, Charles Richard
Tomkins, —and= Kara— L,
Cunningham.

Herring said Fialcowitz, of
Garden City, N.Y., was given the
Rupert Nelson Latture award (Lat-
ture was a student founder of
ODK) because ‘‘we recognized
that he is a mover and a shaker.
He started up Live Drive. People
thought that was one of the big-
gest things to come to this univer-
sity in a long time.’’ Fialcowitz
instituted Live Drive with sopho-
mores Chris Bray and Rob Malloy
because he ‘‘thought it was some-

considered the political perspective
of the Spectator. The EC does
not allocate funds to organizations

that support a specific political
interest or idealogy, such as the
College Republicans and __ the
Young Democrats. Lagarde
explained that although the
Spectator’s organizers are
conservative, the magazine will

not necessarily support a specific
political agenda, nor will the
magazine engage in electioncering.
He reminded the committee of
plans to include pieces expressing
opposing views on the same
subject.

Lagarde also described how the

establishment of new — student
publications is impaired by
bureaucratic difficulties.

Currently, organizers must publish

campus and something that could
be improved.”’ He said the idea
came to him when he was return-
ing from a party out at Zollman’s
last spring. Fialcowitz is also the
sophomore class Executive Com-
mittee representative,

Herring said all ODK initiates
must have a junior or senior
standing and are chosen through
a voting process. The ODK hand-
book states that all possible initi-
ates must “‘rank in the highest
thirty-five percent in scholarship
among students in his or her
class.”’ Herring said the members
are given a list of non-members
who are academically eligible to
become members. At this time,
cach eligible student is discussed
and voted on individually based
on his or her character, leadership
and service. Unfortunately, ac-
cording to Herring, ‘‘some of the
people who have contributed most
to the university are not a part of
ODK because of the academic re-
quirement.”

The ODK spring initiation be-,
gan last year. This naming of
new members, according to Her-
ring, is because of ODK’s des.re
to become more service-oriented
and to provide more campus activ-
ities as were provided this year.
The activities Herring named were

ity Student Association for a panel

OPINION

The North trial —Reclaiming_

Keep your fingers crossed, but the trial of former White
House aide and current W&L Dad Oliver North should be
within days of coming to a close. As we go to press, the
jury is in its twelfth day of deliberations (remember, God
created the world in only six).

To say a resolution to this mess has been long in
coming is an understatement. Unfortunately, the denouement
of this process -- whatever the outcome -- won’t mean as
much as it should. After independent counsel Lawrence
Walsh spent millions investigating the Iran-Contra matter,
he threw out the central charges -- conspiracy to defraud
the U.S. and theft of government property -- rather than
risk forcing the disclosure of classified information.

We considered that turn of events unfortunate, because,
considering last summer’s trial-by-Congress, we thought
North deserved the opportunity to clear his name.

Now, no one seems to know what the impending verdict
will mean. We certainly don’t. And, despite the magnificent
miniseries The Rise and Fall of Oliver North, we're not
sure anybody else does.

Was it worth the millions Walsh spent? Was it worth the
tons of newsprint and days of television air-time that
followed? Was it worth turning the government upside-
down? After all this blood-letting, we still don’t know the
answer to the central questions -- who was aware of and
involved in the diversion of funds when -- and who’s to
say it would have been worth it all if we did?

Of course, there are the impending trials of North’s
colleagues in the Iran-Contra matter. Perhaps those trials
will be more illuminating than North’s -- but don’t bet on
it.

While Walsh and company may be intent on finding out
every detail of the diversion, the rest of us aren’t. Enough
is enough. Let’s hope the jury will send them all home
without any supper -- and thereby lift the sentence the
Washington inquisitors have imposed on the rest of us.

Student wants
librarian tenured

To the Editors:

Spring Term at Washington & Lee means many things to many
people. To seniors, it’s time for ‘‘Popes for Dopes’’ and ‘‘Goshen
and Gondolas’’ or to begin looking for jobs. For undergrads, it’s
time to begin thinking about summer vacation and whether you go
to Barbados or Aspen. It’s time for class work, frizbee on the
Colonnade and parties at Goshen. Spring Term is also when the
faculty decides who gets Tenure and who gets the Boot. This year,
the tenure committee, for reasons unknown, voted against a won-
derful and caring member of the University Library staff, Mrs.
Peggy Hays. I feel, along with a lot of others, that this decision is
WRONG!!!

Mrs. Hays is a competent and dedicated librarian with over
twenty years of experience. She takes an active interest in the lives
of the students and is willing to go to the proverbial ‘‘extra mile”’
to help a student. Indeed, how many faculty members do you
know who will go to the bus station at 3 A.M. to pick up a
student so that they will not have to walk back to campus? I can’t
begin to count the number of times that I have found Mrs. Hays at
work, after hours, looking for that elusive bit of information which
a student has declared as absolutely critical to the survival of their

MY VIEW
By Peter Collier

 

EDITOR'S NOTE: Peter Collier is an au-
thor and former student protestor. His column
appears here courtesy ‘‘Collegiate Times."’

Twenty-five years ago this fall, I was in
school at U.C. Berkeley and helping organize
the Free Speech Movement, one of the open-
ing salvos in the political wars of the "60s.
One aftemoon during a lull in the protest, I
stood up in the middle of a graduate seminar
on James Boswell and began lecturing my
professor, more or less out of the blue, on the
need for a radical consciousness in the class-
room. After I had finished, my professor said
something like this: ‘‘Now that’s all very
interesting, Mr. Collier, and one is certainly
left to wonder what Samuel Johnson would
have thought of such a demand, given his
famous confrontation with John Wilkes. But
then you’re not exactly a John Wilkes, are
you?”’

John Wilkes, I should say, was the flaming
radical of Samuel Johnson’s day, and Johnson,
great Tory that he was, found him a charming
man but also a threat to civilization. At the
time, of course, I identified with Wilkes and
was stung by the suggestion that my radical-
ism was less than his. It’s a measure of how
far I’ve come that I now identify with good
old Sam Johnson, who saw the radicals of his
day as ‘‘unprincipled and destructive scoun-
drels,”’

More to the point, it’s a measure of how
far the university has come that the process
I’ve just described now occurs exactly in re-
verse. No longer is it a case of students try-
ing to intrude radical politics into the class-
room and being politely rebuffed by professors
who take their jobs seriously. Now it’s the
other way around. University officials make
leftism part of the intellectual air students
breathe, and professors are using their rooms
as bully pulpits from which to force correct
political attitudes on the young.

We New Left radicals paid little attention
to conservatives back in the early ’60s. Our
real targets were liberals -- Cold War liberals,
corporate liberals, and most of all the liberals
who formed the vital center in the Democratic
Party, and who had been present at the cre-
ation of the postwar world. We knew that if
we could break their power, we'd change
America forever. And we did. This is one
of the few undisputed truths of the New Left.

But of all the liberal strongholds, the one
we attacked with special venom was the uni-
versity. Why? Because it claimed to sympa-
thize with our frustration, because of its al-
leged ties to the war machine, because it was
the only place we could have an impact, be-
cause it was there.

McCarthyism had scarred the university.
When I first arrived at Berkeley in 1957,
these wounds were still fairly raw. But the
Left’s reign of terror in the 1960s affected the
university far more than the senator from Wis-

Radicals invaded

teaching. Radicals assaulted students who
didn’t agree with them. Radicals set fire to
libraries whose offense was to hold the accu-
mulated wisdom of Western civilization. Rad-
icals bombed buildings where work was al-
legedly being done in support of ‘‘American
fascism.”’

Radicals maimed individual lives and, on
many campuses, brought the business of edu-
cation to a standstill. I know, because I was
one of them. We changed forever -- in a
way old Joe McCarthy, with all his delusions
of grandeur, never would have thought of
doing -- what is taught, and how, and why.
We brought the university to its knees and it’s
remained in that posture ever since.

We need an academic
equivalent of the Reagan
Doctrine -- an effort to roll
back the Left’s successes in
the university.

Yet after Vietnam many of my old com-
rades reentered the university as professors
and administrators. Having failed to change
America in their image in the ’60s, they used
the respite offered by the ‘‘Me Decade’’ to
get on the tenure track. In part, they were
seeking a convalescent home where they could
recover from radical burnout. But they were
also acting on the one lesson they had learned
from the 1960s: To be effective, they would
have to hunker down for the long struggle in
a tolerant environment.

I first saw the effects of their decision late
in the 1970s, when I was teaching at Berkeley
as a visiting writer. By that time, innovations
for the ’60s such as ‘‘ethnic studies’’ had
cheapened the curriculum. By themselves,
however, such excrescences would have been
self-limiting; most students knew that these
courses were trivial and avoided them like the
plague. The problem was the New Left men-
tality that had seeped into the way the univer-
sity saw itself and its central academic disci-
plines. Its proponents were beginning to in-

changing the curriculum to break down the

they were encountering little resistance.

The transformation of the university that

began in the ’60s and accelerated during the
following decade is now nearly complete.
Leftists have created an ambience in which

We need an academic equivalent of the

As a History Major, I know the value of good reference person-

worked with. I feel that Mrs. Hays deserves to receive tenure. She
is an outstanding person who makes a real difference to this
school. We pay $10,000 tuition to attend a university which prides
itself, and rightly so, on being one of the best in the nation. It is
only right that we, the student body, have faculty and staff which
exemplify the high standards of Washington & Lee University.
Mrs. Peggy Hays is such a person and to deny her a position,
which I feel she richly deserves, is to make a mockery of those
standards,

MY VIEW
By D. Ross Patterson

 

The wheel has come full circle.
In the beginning, there were
minorities who were discriminated
against. Society (i.e., the courts)
decreed that they should be pro-
tected. Equal opportunity legisla-
tion was instituted with the laud-
able purpose of insuring that all
people regardless of race, sex,
creed or color would be treated
equally. However, this noble pur-
pose has been perverted. Instead
of guaranteeing equal rights to all
people, affirmative action has re-
sulted in the favoring of minority
group members relative to their
white counterparts.

Arguing

MY VIEW
By Mike Shady

 

 

I am confused. I always
thought abortion was a complex
issue -- one in which a clear-cut
solution could not be reached.
Not so, according to the three
opinion columns that appeared in
last week’s Phi. Mr. Bettendorf
argues that ‘‘no one would dare
claim that abortion is in any way
morally good.’’ Miss Heiskell
says ‘“‘no one has the right to de-
ny life.’ And Mr. Cook states
that “‘anyway you look at it, a
life is taken in abortion,”

So I guess this abortion dilem-
ma is pretty easily solved then,
right? No question about it, abor-
tions should be made illegal and
any woman who has one per-
formed and any doctor who per-
forms one should be thrown in jail
for murder. Case closed.

But it’s not that simple, is it?
I want to present a hypothetical
situation to Mr. Bettendorf. What

A recent article by Paul Rob-
erts appearing in The Richmond
Times-Dispatch discusses Michigan
State University’s affirmative ac-

blacks, Asians, Hispanics, and na-
tive Americans) are allotted addi-
tional points by virtue of their
race. This policy of affirmative

abortion:

if your mother were raped and be-
came pregnant? And what if hav-
ing that child would endanger the
life of your mother, as well as the
child’s? Should she be forced to
carry the child to full term? Your
article seems to suggest so.
Wouldn’t abortion in this hypothe-
tical case be justified on ethical
grounds, or at least in an ethical
context?

discrimination based on race, but
Michigan State’s policy goes too
far in the pursuit of affirmative
action. To quote Roberts, "Racial
groups now have entitlement to
their share of college degrees
whether they earn them or not."
Policies similar to this one are un-
fair to all parties involved. White

students are prevented from attain-
ing admission to the schools they
deserve; deserving minority stu-
dents’ achievements are cheapened
by prevailing attitudes that these
achievements are the result of spe-
cial treatment and not hard work.
Quotas and special standards to
insure "proper" ratios of minorities
to whites in organizations, whether
they be colleges or businesses, are
unfair to everyone. Equal oppor-
tunity should mean exactly that:
an equal opportunity to achieve,
with no special privileges for any-
one, regardless of race, sex, creed

ma and horror of such an incident,
has to bear the incredible burden
of carrying a child for nine
months. Doesn’t seem fair or
*just’’ to me.

The typical rebuttal to the rape
problem along with incest is to
say, ‘‘Okay, we'll make except-
ions for rape and incest,’’ which
our current president has said on
several occasions. This is absurd.

 

What about the rights

of a rape victim who

becomes pregnant? Is she responsible for
bearing that child? Saying “tough break” is

not the answer.

 

As for Miss Heiskell’s beliefs,
the rape situation applies here as
well. What about the woman’s
rights in this predicament? A
child that she had no intention of
having is now inside of her body.
Is she responsible, and if so, why
should she be? She did not ask
to be raped. Mr. Bettendorf wants
‘justice’ but I find it hard to ac-
cept that justice is served if a rape
victim, after experiencing the trau-

How can abortion be murder in
one context and yet be permissible
in another? To their credit, the
three articles last week allowed
for no loopholes or exceptions,
but, while their reasoning is con-
sistent, it does not say what is the
“‘right’’ thing to do in the situa-
tions of rape and incest,

Here’s yet another scenario: a
pregnant woman discovers after
medical tests that the child she is

carrying will be born mentally re-
tarded. The financial consider-
ations (special medical and school
bills) aside, is everyone emotional-
ly ready or willing to be the
mother or father of a_ retarded
child? What kind of ‘“‘life’’ does

should be aborted, but isn’t this «
yet another difficult decision that —

must be rendered?

What I find disturbing with the
views presented last week is the
limiting stance they take toward
abortion, All three attempt to
strip the issue down to one basic

fact: an unbom child has the right ‘

to life. What none of these opin-

ions examines are the rights of the _

woman involved. There are many
moral dilemmas in

which the °

rights of one person conflict with ,

the rights of another, and abortion
is one of these problems.

Saying °

‘*tough break’ to a raped woman ,

who becomes pregnant is not the
answer.

Despite EC’s denial,

the Spectator will hit the
Colonnade this month, as planned.
Lagarde said that expenses are

being personally covered by
magazine organizers, who hope to
be reimbursed with funds collected
from alumni.

Also at Monday’s meeting, the
Liberty Hall Volunteers described
their activities and petitioned the
EC for additional funds. President
David Burns described how the
Volunteers done vintage Civil War
uniforms and use equipment of
that cra to promote an
understanding of the war and an
appreciation of the role of the
soldiers. Burns said that this
spring, the Volunteers will join
VMI cadets and area residents in
a reenactment of the Battle of
New Market. At that battle,
cadets joined Confederate forces to
defend this area from the invading
Union Army. The event. will be
filmed and a movie will be
produced for VMI’s New Market

Museum. _ Wal -wile he
mentioned in the credits and

Burns said that muscum curators
estimate that the film be shown
for the next 50 years.

Bums led the group’s petition
for funds. He requested
reimbursement to cover the cost of
programs for last October’s Lee
memorial — service. Burns
requested money to — purchase
canteens and blankets for the New
Market reenactment. EC President
Christopher de Movellan said that
the group clearly engages in
worthwhile activities; however, he
suggested that the Student Activity
Board’s current debt should be
considered. EC Vice President
Hugh Finkelstein reported that the
SAB is approximately $10,000 -
$15,000 in debt. In addition, de
Movellan cited that the group was
granted $1000 earlier this year, a
substantial amount in consideration
of the small number of students
involved and their limited number
of activilics.

Burns said that the Voluntgers
perform a_ school service by
promoting W&L’s reputation, The
Volunteers are casing the tension
between W&L students and local
groups through overnight camps
and daytime marches with these
groups. Burns especially noted
that the Volunteers are one of the
few organizations at W&L that
interacts with VMI cadets. He

felt. that recent activitics with
cadets led the participants to
resolve some of the rivalry

between men at W&L and VMI.
The EC voted to allocate $104.05
to the Volunteers for the purchase
of canteens.

In other EC business, members
concurred with  Finkelstein’s
opinion that a telegram from
students at W&L to students in
the People’s Republic of China
would be appropriate. The
Chinese students are demanding
freedoms promoted by George
Washington, a founder of U.S., as
well as an early supporter of
W&L.

Sophomore _ Representative
Willard Dumas reported on a
professor’s request — that the
committee review the current
policy for the distribution of grade
change sheets. Grade change
sheets are not released directly to
Students. Dumas _ said that
according to Registrar Scott
Dittman, the policy blocks the
temptation to forge a_professor’s
signature and commit an_ honor
violation. The professor believes
that the policy may be unfairly
questioning the honor of students.
Discussion on the matter was
postponed until next week’s
meeting. Junior Representative
Brandon Canaday reported on the
theft of utensils and dishes from
Evan’s Dining Hall. Since the
fall term, approximately 200 cups
liave disappeared from Evans.
Evans managers requested that de
Movellan write ¢ short note to

remind students that the theft of
Evans utensils and dishes is an
honor violation and consequently
punishable by expulsion.

Chi Os initiate

 

By Cullins Carriker
Staff Reporter

"In a couple of years our
new sorority system will be fully
integrated into fraternity and
campus life and we can all look
back proudly because we are
charter members of the system
and our own special Chi Omega
Chapter, the first installed sorority
on campus," stated Keri Hinrichs,

senior president of the Chi Omega
colony at Washington and Lee
University.

The installation of the Xi
Lambda Chapter of Chi Omega
onto the W&L campus was held
on Satruday April 29, 1989 at
Southem Seminary College in
Buena Vista, Virginia. The
installing chapter was the Lambda
Gamma Chapter of the University
of Virginia at Charlottesville.

 

ODK

(continued from page 1)

#e also said ODK provided a stu-
dent seminar on leadership style
that brought in a professor from
Virginia Polytechnic _Institute.
Yesterday a leadership program
was provided at Lexington High
School with Norm Lord, professor
of Physical Education. Herring
said there was an ODK luncheon
twice a month to discuss various
school affairs. He said the pro-
grams ODK provided this year
were a result of those luncheons.

SPCA

 

 

One of the main reasons for these
new programs, according to Her-
ring, was ‘‘we’re trying to become
more than just an honorary soci-
ety.”’ Herring said ODK has been
thought of in the past as being an
inactive society with the potential
to be very active and effective
around the W&L community. He
said this inactiveness made several
non-members of ODK view the
society in a negative manner.

The new members will be offi-
cially ‘‘tapped,’’ or inducted, in
January of 1990. Next year’s of-
ficers are J. Wayne Burris, Presi-
dent, and Shawn Copeland, Vice
President.

occurs, Cornett said, agreeing with
HSUS. The SPCA requires that
all animals adopted from the shel-
ter be spayed within a specified
period of time. Court action is
brought against people who do not
comply.

In order to begin building a
new shelter, the SPCA needs ap-
proval from the HSUS in Wash-
ington and the state veterinarian in
Richmond. Funds for the
proposed shelter must be obtained
completely through donations. A
large fund raising campaign will
begin once land is purchased,
Cornett said.

Wilma Lester, a member of
the SPCA board, expressed: the
urgency of the goal in the group’s
spring newsletter. ‘“‘This time of
year brings home our critical need
for a new and larger Animal Shel-

As far as which books sell,
Thompson said that local history
books are on everyone’s shopping
list, but beyond that, it depends on
the season and what’s ‘‘hot’’ at
the time. She said during Christ-
mas, All I Really to Know I
Learned In Kindergarten, a book
on psychology by Dr. Robert
Fulghum, received a lot of atten-
tion.

Looking over the _ birch
Plywood shelves in the
comfortable store, one notices that
there are no magazines or newspa-
pers to purchase. Thompson ex-
plained, ‘‘I’ve tried stocking mag-
azines and newspapers in the past,
but people could easily buy them
elsewhere, or they would buy one
issue and subscribe. So, I lost
money on them. However, we
still sell the Sunday edition of the
New York Times.”’

She added, ‘‘I think Lexington
would be a good place for a real
good newsstand.”

The Best Seller’s book selec-
tion covers everything from diet-
ing to art. Humpty Dumpty, in the
company of a troop of stuffed ani-
mals, smiles from the cover of a
book on one beige shelf, and Lee

Robertson and Shirley MacLaine,
smiles from another shelf.

Although the Best Seller is
still small in comparison to large
chains like B. Dalton’s' or
Waldenbooks, its size is compen-
sated by its operators’ willingness
to serve.

Sbar Speaks:

Sbar becomes born

 

By Jon Sbar

As a young drug-crazed jour-
nalist at Plant High School, I was
known as a writer who could go
too far. In one article, for exam-
ple, I detailed a hypothetical sexu-
al encounter between two guidance
counselors and my elderly physics
teacher (I’m still paying off the
libel settlement). However my
days of lunatic journalism are long
gone. Thanks to a sudden religious
experience I became a born again
Christian-Jewish-Moslem-Buddhist
writer. Now that I maintain such
high ethical standards, occasionally
I am forced to overlook some hig-
hly interesting material. Take the
case of my late night naked kitch-
en stalking housemate. What an
article it would make if I was
able to tell readers, in intricate
detail, about certain individuals I
live with who grew up with the
notion that its okay to walk down
the hall to the kitchen butt naked
to eat cheese nachos provided that
it’s between the hours of 2:00 and
5:00 A.M. But as a Born Again
Journalist how could I? It would-
n't be ethical; anyone with deter-
mination, natural investigative sk-
ills has instant access to the
names and home addresses of my
housemates. So instead of late
night nudity I will discuss Albert
"the animal" Einstein, the great
scientist (and butterfly collector)
who discovered the major ele-
ments (earth, wind, air and fire)
using only a tool kit and a box of
matches,

The night after discovering the
elements Einstein was chain smok-
ing unfiltered Camel Cigarettes,
drinking Old Milwaukee beer and
listening to rap music when it oc-
curred to him that all matter in

 

the universe, even his dog Elec-
tron, are moving towards a state
of chaos. What this meant in sci-
entific terms is that Einstein now
had a good excuse for not clean-
ing up the garage.

Ethelda (Einstein’s wife): ‘‘Al-
bert, I don’t give a damn if you
did win the Nobel Prize, if that
garage is not clean by tomorrow
I’m taking your favorite calculator
to the pawn shop.”’

Einstein (in his rural dialect):
‘But garsh darn it Ethelda clean-
ing up the garage is a waste of
time. Clean or dirty the garage’ ll
still be headed for a state of cha-
Oh

That next day, while cleaning
out the garage, Einstein discovered
that garage mattcr could not be
created or destroyed unless you
hauled it to the dumpster.

Since we’re already on the sub-
ject of great intellectuals now
would be the best time for me to
discuss Donna Rice and her winter
visit to Washington and Lee Uni-
versity for an ethics seminar (that
same weekend Ghandi was in Le-
xington for a handgun combat se-
minar). It seems that the visiting
Donna Rice was not the peroxide
blonde, breast implanted opportun-
ist you might have read about in
the papers.

The real Donna Rice is Donna
"Robin Hood" Rice, a former
Kool-Aid drinking girl scout who
worked her way through college
and astrophysics graduate school.
The real Donna Rice travels a-
round, disguised by buck teeth and
shaved head, stealing from the
rich and giving to the poor. Thou-
gh I would like nothing better
than to tell you about Donna and
her band of ‘‘Merry Bandits’,
which incidentally includes Mother
Theresa, some thing deep inside of

again?

my body (my large intestine) is
motivating me to move on to the
complex subject of Dade County
resident, Peggy Fields. |

Fields, who was blinded after
being struck by a flying roll of
toilet paper, is living proof of that
prehistoric cliche,‘‘It’s only fun
until someone loses an eye.’’ Ac-
cording to the Tampa Tribune, the
“roll of toilet paper sailed 60 feet
through the air and hit her behind
the left ear.’

Ry this time readers are proba-
bly wondering why this article, in
total disregard for the laws of or-
ganization, is jumping from topic
to topic, from Born Again Journal-
ism to naked kitchen stalkers,
from naked kitchen stalkers to Al-
bert Einstein, from Albert Einstein
to Donna Rice and from Donna
Rice to Peggy Fields. Although I
would love to tell you why I must
end this article immediaiely. You
see, I’m late for a Donna Rice
seminar on Born Again Jcurnalism
and I promised my good friend
Albert Einstein that I'd give him a
ride, Besides, the naked kitchen
stalker is probably gearing up (I
mean down) for a late night sna-
ck.

Buchanan finishing final semester

 

By Mitchell Schmale
Staff Reporter

 

William Buchanan walks with
a cane into his office in the
School of Commerce, Economics
and Politics, snaps off the dark
sunshades covering his glasses,
which he must wear due to recent
cataract surgery, and sits at his
cluttered desk to look over his ap-
pointments for the day. The
70-year-old politics professor takes
his time because his 23-year
career at Washington and Lee is
drawing to a close. This is his last
spring semester.

‘“‘Time is what I have plenty
of,’’ said Buchanan.

Buchanan = graduated ~_— from
Washington and Lee in 1941 with
a certificate in journalism, a major
in French and a_ masters in
English. He accomplished this un-
der a different system that existed
at Washington and Lee up until
the 1940’s.

He said his proudest and most
rewarding experience as an under-
graduate was serving as the senior
editor of the Ring-tum Phi.

Following graduation, Buchan-

an worked on a newspaper in
Lynchburg and then joined the
Navy as a communications officer.
He served from 1942 to 1946 in
South America and Europe decod-
ing and untangling messages.

After World War II Buchanan
taught English and journalism at
Roanoke College for one year un-
til 1947, He then returned to
W&L for two years to work on
the Washington and Lee bicenten-
nial anniversary and teach one
class in journalism.

In 1949, Buchanan went to
graduate school at Princeton Uni-
versity, receiving his Ph.D in 19-
55. He taught political science in
Mississippi, California and Tennes-
see before returning to W&L in
1966.

“IT was glad to have the op-
portunity to come back,”’ said Bu-
chanan, who is famous for his Re-
search Methods class.

Senior Jamie Gaucher, a polit-
ical science major, describes
Buchanan’s teaching methods as
“‘hard, but fair.’’

Buchanan is a member of the
American Political Science Associ-
ation and was the chairman of its

Panel of Review from 1968 to
1969. He has also written two
books including, ‘‘Understanding
Political Variables’ and has co-a-
uthored three other books on poli-
tics.

The politics professor is a
regular contributor of articles to
many political science journals, is
a member of Phi Beta Kappa and
was the Visiting Fellow at Oxford
in the Winter of 1983.

“‘Washington and Lee gave
me a very good education,’’ said
Buchanan, who places much im-
portance on knowledge and a good
education.

“Teaching is something you
do from day to day and it is re-
warding,’’ said Buchanan, ‘“‘I’ve
taught quite a number of people.”’

When asked why he’s retiring,
Buchanan laughs and says, ‘‘Be-
cause I’m 70.”’

He said his plans for the fu-
ture are not definite yet, but he
plans to spend his time relaxing
and enjoying himself. He is cur-
rently auditing a freshman chemis-
try course.

Edward C. Atwood Jr., profes-
sor of economics and the former
dean of the School of Commerce,
Economics and Politics, said Bu-
chanan has been a ‘“‘great asset to
Washington and Lee.”’

“‘We were very lucky to get
him. He and his wife have been a
great asset to the community,”’
said Atwood.

“But, I wish he were younger
so he wouldn’t have to retire,”’
Atwood said with a smile.

W&L upsets VMI in Lee-Jackson game

The Mens’ Tennis team seems
fo have a trip to _— scenic
Kalamazoo, Michigan, in their
future. Currently tied for fourth
‘in the nation, Washington & Lee’s
§tringmen are certain to have yet
another bid to the NCAA Division

bag.

The match was played at
Davidson, in North Carolina, to
prevent either team from making
an eight-hour drive. Because of
“weather conditions, the contest
‘was moved indoors after half an
“hour of play.

. ‘‘Emory was quite a shocker,”
Said sophomore Bill Meadows,
‘whose win at No. 2 doubles with
‘senior partner Robert Haley
clinched the team victory. Emory
sends into battle a young, yet
talented, team. ‘‘Their No.
player is only a sophomore,”
Meadows continued, ‘‘and four of
their top six are freshmen.”’

Three-set matches were the
order of the day on Saturday, with
six of the nine skirmishes going
the distance. ‘With six three-
setters, it could have easily been
‘7-2 either way,’’ said W&L Head
,Coach Gary Franke.

The most exciting of these
six showdowns, for the Blue and
White, was at the No. 3 position.
W&L’s Haley was down 5-3 in
the third and raged back to force
the deciding set into a tie-breaker.
After falling behind 0-2 in the
"breaker, Haley poured on_ the
steam and shut down his

Other winners for the Generals
were senior John Morris (15-5) at
No. 1, classmate Bobby Matthews
(17-3) at No. 2, and junior Billy
Tunner (9-3) at the No. 6 spot.

In doubles action, W&L’s only
point came from Meadows and
Haley. The No. 1 duo of Morris
and Matthews emerged with a 17-
3 record, while the new No, 3
pair of Tunner and sophomore
Reid Manley are 3-0.

It was a familiar face opposing
the Washington and Lee baseball
team on Monday in the semifinals
of the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference tournament. In fact, it
was the same face who, earlier in
the year, on a_ basketball court,

opposed the Generals in the
ODAC Tournament finals.
Hampden-Sydney’s Ralph

Baker got the call to pitch against
the Generals on Monday, and just
as he did during basketball season,
he ended W&L’s season by
pitching the Tigers to a 7-1 win
over the Generals in Hampden-
Sydney,

WAL scored first off Baker in
the first inning, when senior center
fielder Tom Skeen singled home
senior shortstop Harry Halpert to
give the Generals a 1-0 lead.
Hampden-Sydney tied the game
off W&L starter Mike Temple,
who was the starter when W&L

The game stayed tied until the
bottom of the fifth, when H-SC
scored twice to take the lead for
good, touching Temple for the
first of two two-run homers on the
day. The Tigers struck again in
the sixth, with another homer,
finishing Temple for the day.

Steve Momorella, a freshman
who emerged as the ace of the
W&L staff, came on in_ the
seventh and didn’t fare much
better, allowing two runs as the
Tigers moved out to a 7-1 lead.

The secret of W&L’s success
throughout the season had been
the timely hitting of seniors Eddie

Klank, Tony Waskiewicz,
Halpert, Skeen and junior Rich
Grace. Baker and one relief
pitcher held the heart of the

Generals order to a combined 4-20
on the day. Klank and Grace,
hitting .370 and .420 coming into
the game, both went 0-4. Tim
Wheeler had two hits for the
Generals.

The Generals also hit into four
double plays on the day aiding the
Tigers’ cause.

For the season, the Generals

Wiemi scores winner in OT

 

By Jay Plotkin
Assistant Sports Editor

 

In a way, the Washington and
Lee men’s. lacrosse team
underwent a passing of the torch
last Saturday in the second annual
Lee-Jackson Classic.

On attack, the torch was
passed from senior two-time All-
American John Ware to freshman
Wiemi Douoguih, and that passing
resulted in W&L’s most exciting
win in some time.

The Generals scored late in the
game to send it into overtime
before defeating the Keydets 10-9
on VMI’s) Alumni Memorial
Stadium.

In what W&L called their
version of the NCAA tournament,
the Generals jumped out early,
running to a 6-2 lead with 9:17
left in the second quarter. After
VMI opened the scoring, Ware
tied the game with 10:54 left in
the opening period. Fifty-one
seconds later, Ware found
Douoguih open, and the freshman
converted for the first of his four
goals on the day.

Sophomore Todd Garliss made
his presence felt early on as well,
scoring with 8:58 left off a feed
from classmate Mike Moseman.
After VMI scored to cut the lead
to 3-2, Garliss scored again off
Ware’s second assist of the game
to open the second quarter.

After a W&L time out,
Douoguih scored again, unassisted,
to make it 5-2, and Ware followed
that goal with his second of the
day to make it 6-2.

The Keydets then went to work
behind Tim Nolan. Nolan tallied
two goals, including one with :03
left in the half, and an assist to
bring the game to a 6-6 tie at
halftime. Dave Hope also scored
twice in the first half for VMI.

The six goal outburst for W&L
doubled the team’s average output
in its last three games, all losses.

The scoring continued for
W&L when Moseman scored the
lone third quarter goal to give the
Generals a 7-6 lead. But VMI
was equal to the task, and when
Nolan scored his third goal of the
game with 12:30 left in regulation,
the Keydets had their first lead at
8-7.

Things looked grim for W&L,
as they had not played well this
season with their backs to the
wall, but Andy Guida, yet another
sophomore, scored his lone goal
of the season to even the game at
8-8 with 7:30 left.

With 2:32 left, VMI’s William
Coleman put the Generals one
step closer to another defeat with

From Staff Reports

 

The Washington and Lee
women’s lacrosse team closed
its first year as a varsity sport
with an impressive showing in
the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference Tournament,
reaching the semifinals and
playing its best lacrosse of the

year.

The W&L women, 7-8 for
the year, opened tournament
play on Wednesday with a
quarterfinal game with Hollins.
Hollins had defeated W&L 5-4
in Lexington earlier this year,
but the Generals rallied to win
7-5 at Hollins.

The win moved _ the
Generals into the semifinals on
Friday, where they faced No. 2
seed Roanoke College.
Roanoke had defeated W&L
by a 16-8 count earlier this
year, but this game would be a

his second goal of the game, but
Douoguih made it clear that W&L
would not come up short again.
With 2:00 left, he registered his
first NCAA hat-trick with the goal
that put the game into overtime
tied at 9-9.

In the overtime period,
Generals head coach Dennis Daly

had junior Chris Kennedy face off*

in the place of regular face off
man Stu Geisel, a senior in his
last game. Kennedy won the
draw to start the overtime, and the
Generals never lost possession of
the ball.

After a time out, the Generals
came out with a play designed for
Ware, but when he wasn’t open,
the ball found its way into the
stick of Douoguih. The freshman
wasted no ume in ending the
game, and he beat his defenseman
and scored his fourth goal of the

game, giving the Generals a
thrilling 10-9 season ending
victory over VMI.

Said Douoguih, ‘‘I wasn’t
surprised that I got the ball
because during the time out,
Coach [Daly] told us that if

Johnny [Ware] wasn’t open, that I
should get the ball and try to go
to the goal. Once I got the ball, I
was determined to go to the goal,
and I felt pretty confident that I
could because I had just beaten
the guy guarding me a_ few
minutes earlier.”’

“It’s about time,’’ said Ware,
who finished his career tied for
sixth on W&L’s all-time scoring
list. ‘‘This was our version of the
NCAA tournament.”’

Said Daly, ‘I think what I'll
remember from this game--the
way we came back. We scored
more goals in the first half than
we'd scored in some of our games
lately, but they [VMI] had to have
the momentum going into the
locker room,”’

W&L, 4-9, will return five of
its top six scorers next season.
Moseman leads the returning
players with 15 points (5 goals, 10
assists), followed by sophomores
Garliss (10,3), Brian Overbeck
(4,5), Douoguih (8,0) and junior
Chris Mastrogiovanni (7,0).
Douoguih, whose four goals were
the most by a W&L_ freshman
since Neil Redfern scored four in
a 28-1 win over Va. Tech in
1986, scored all eight of his goals
in the last four games.

“We had some tough losses
and people were getting down,”
said Douoguih. ‘‘The win came
at a good time for the team, It
picked everybody up, being that it
came at the end of the season and

different story. The Generals
trailed early, but cut the
margin to 10-7 before falling
14-10. Freshman Kim Bishop

Generals. Freshman goalie |
Erica Ingersoll added 14 saves,

said W&L head coach Janine

‘The Icarus Agenda’- a superthriller

 

 

By Chris Swann
Staff Reporter

 

The megathriller writer Robert
Ludlum has done it again with his
latest bestseller The Icarus Agen-
da. From Southwest Asia to Colo-
rado, Virginia to the Pacific Oce-
an, Mr. Ludlum weaves a tale of
violence and betrayal, intrigue and
passion guaranteed to capture the
attention of audiences agound the
world as the author instills fear
into the reader with the possibility
that his fiction could indeed be
fact.

A key part of Mr. Ludlum’s
style is his ability to describe a
situation authentically, getting the
"nuts and bolts" of the story cor-
rect, as did Ian Fleming with his
James Bond series. He seems to
have a knowlege of the intelli-
gence community that could only
belong to a secret agent. In The
Osterman Weekend, for example,
he writes of the Central Intelli-
gence Agency running a domestic
operation, an act clearly specified
as illegal in that agency’s charter.

This "fictional" story shocked rea-
ders at the time. Later of course,
that "fiction" was revealed to be
fact in several cases. However,
Robert Ludlum was never a spy
or a secret agent. He spent nearly
twenly years in show business as
an actor, producer and the voice
of several television commercials.
He draws heavily on his experi-
ence as an entertainer to write his
novels, creating labyrinthine situa-
tions designed to draw his readers
into his works, and as he admits
in an interview in the back of The
Parsifal Mosaic, “1 write primarily
as an entertainer." However, Lud-
lum also writes from a point of
view other than pure entertain-
ment. "I admit to being out-
raged -- mostly by the abuse of
power by the fanatics. The ex-
tremes bother me, right of left."
He also adds, "I disapprove of vi-
olence, that’s why I show pain for
what it is. When my characters
get his, they hurt. They don’t
jump back into action like John
Wayne."

These ‘‘points of view’’ are

Clearly present in The Icarus Age-
nda, which starts out with a cur-
rent worldwide horror - terrorism.
Dozens of American hostages are
being held in Masqat, Oman by
crazed fanatics who demand im-
possible requests. The only form
of help comes from a United Sta-
les congressman, Evan Kendrick,
who believes his extensive conta-
cts in the area and his understand-
ing of the Arab mind can help
shut down the crisis. Morally out-
raged, Kendrick wants total ano-
nymity, refusing to take any credit
for his actions and seeking no po-
litical mileage. Ludlum _ propels
Kendrick, and the reader, into a

shadow world of espionage and‘

death that leaves Kendrick shaken
to the core. The author’s accurate
use of the exotic Arabic back-
ground further interests the reader
and shocks him as well. The crisis
over, Kendrick returns to his home
in Colorado, determined to remain
nameless and wanting only to fin-
ish his political term in order to
return to his private life.

One year later, the true story of

The Ring-tum Phi, May 4, 1989

Oman is revealed. Kendrick’s role
in Masgat and photographs of the
maverick congressman ar2 printed
on newspapers worldwide. Almost
immediately, Kendrick is thrown
back into a world of violence and
betrayal, facing enraged Arab fa-
natics determined to destroy the
congressman, finding corruption at

the highest levels of government, °

and realizing the existence of a
secret "government within a gov-
ernment" with its own agenda for
Kendrick - the Icarus agenda.

This Ludlum creation has spa-
wned some of the most intense
and living characters of ludlum’s
career: Evan Kendrick, a politician
disgusted by the corruption around
him who seeks only the truth;
Manny Weingrass, the irascible
old Jewish architect whose gruff,
obnoxious exterior cannot hide his
fatherly love for Kendrick; the be-
autiful and mysterious Khalehla, a
cold and experienced CIA field
agent with a very human heart
that is touched by Kendrick’s de-
cency; Frank Swann (no relation
to this writer), the overworked yet

GN’R’s Lies:‘A musically diverse gem

 

By Charlie Gay
Staff Reporter

 

It’s not often that a heavy met-
al/nard rock debut stays on the
charts for 58 weeks, but Guns N’
Roses’ Appetite for Destruction LP
has done exactly that. The band’s
follow-up, GN'R Lies, is also do-
ing well.

As of March 16, Appetite was
firmly entrenched in the number
four slot on the Rolling Stone LP
chart, while Lies was hot on its
predecessor’s heels at number five.
The band’s more recent offering,
dismissed by its creators as some-
thing to tide fans over, is actually
a musically diverse gem, revealing
Guns N’ Roses as no less than an
80’s-90’s Led Zeppelin.

The first half of Lies is actual-
ly a repackaging of the 1986 inde-
pendent release Live Like a Sui-
cide. Bassist Duff McKagan ex-
plained he had seen copies of the
EP for $150, and its inclusion on
Lies was the band’s little favor to
its fans. The four songs were, as
the EP’s title suggests, recorded in
concert and, though rough, are
also fairly melodic. The album
begins with an unintelligible stre-
am of curse words, followed by
the heavy "Reckless Life" and
"Nice Boys". (Incidentally, those
overly offended by obscenities be-
ginning with "f" and the like are
to avoid this work at all costs.)

and Henry streets in downtown
Lexington.

Albert C. Gordon, head of the
WAL fine arts department, directs
the all-student cast. Monica Burke,
senior drama major, will play Au-
drey, the ditzy shop girl who cap-
tures the heart of social misfit
Seymour, who will be portrayed
by Michael Carroll.

Audrey II, the "mean green
mother from outer space," is being
created by W&L’s Total Theatre
class. The plant will actually be
five plants which range in size
from six inches to eight feet. The
larger plants will be controlled
from the inside by Willie Hender-
son. Audrey II’s singing, wheedl-
ing voice will come from Michael
Tuggle.

Both songs are fairly standard, yet
spirited, hard rock with "Nice
Boys" expressing the underlying
ethos: "Nice boys don’t play rock
n’ roll -- I’m not a nice boy.”

Next is the funkier Aerosmith-
influenced "Move to the City",
which is fine, but drags slightly.
The live half of the LP would be
good, but not especially inspiring,
if not for its superb finale -- an
excellent reading of the Aerosmith
classic "Mama Kim". Here the
sound is somewhat tighter and the
metai flows energetically behind
the confident vocals of Axl Rose.
Do yourself a favor and play this
at a loud volume during a party
(before midnight in Lexington, of
course). It’s worth the price of
the record/tape/CD by itself.

The live half of Lies is good,
but if the entire album were like
it, it would be merely a decent
metal release. However, the sec-
ond half consists of four brilliant
acoustic songs, which put forth a
claim for Guns N’ Roses as a
successor to Zeppelin’s career re-
call that the quasi-metallic smash
Led Zeppelin II was followed up
by the experimental L.Z. Jil,
which featured hard rock gems
like "The Immigrant Song," along
with the classic acoustic tune
“Tangerine.” The acoustic work
really allows the superior mus-
icianship of GN’R= to _ shine
through as they prove themselves
to be more than "just" a metal
band.

Gordon, sorting through a pite
ot costumes on the third floor of
DuPont Hall, said “Little Shop of
Horrors" is "the most technically
complicated show" he has directed
at W&L. Gordon cited the five
versions of Audrey II, the func-
tional dentist’s chair, and the cha-
nge of the Skid Row flower shop
into a bright, modern, booming
business as technical difficulties
being handled by the "Total The-
atre" class.

The sadistic dentist, Orin Scriv-
ello, will be played by Scott Bell,
and the role of Mr. Mushnik, the
Jewish florist, will be played by
Todd Peppers. Karen Washington,
Courtney Harpold and Margaret
Pimblett will comprise the ethnic
doo-wop trio of Ronnette, Crystal

The nearly six-minute long bal-
lad "Patience" heralds the transi-
tion of Lies from lion to lamb.
The absence of drums in the song
lends to it a haunting quality that
its comrades share to a greater or
lesser degree. "Patience" is a tes-
tament to the superlative guitar
skills of slash (you know, like St-
ing, Edge, et al), whose intricate
work expresses a wistful and al-
most countrified flavor. "Sad wo-
man, take it slow and it'll work
itself out fine/All we need is just
a little patience," Rose sings. The
song seemingly ends after about 4
1/2 minutes, only to slip into a
confessional coda: "I been walking
the streets at night, just trying to
get it right/Hard to see with so
many around, no, I don’t like get-
ting stuck in the ground...‘cause I
need you."

The next two compositions are
more or less tongue-in-cheek, and
quite enjoyable. Axl, Slash, Duff,
and company call the first of the
two "Used to Love Her" "a joke,
nothing more" on the outside cov-
er, and one listen to the lyrics
makes it clear why at first listen:
"I used to love her, but I had to
kill her/l had to put her six feet
under, and I can still hear her
complain." “You’re Crazy" may
sound a bit familiar, this is be-
cause it appeared on Appetite in a
metallic rendition. According to
the band, the acoustic version is
the original, and its blues-y feel
and condescending vocals justify

and Chiffon.

People who come expecting a
traditional Broadway musical will
be disappointed," said Peppers.
"It’s definitely not Rogers and Ha-
mmerstein!"

"The music is infectious," Gor-
don said. "You certainly won’t get
tired of it."

The production of "Little Shop
of Horrors" pzomises to be a pop-
ular one -- opening night is almost
sold out already, according to Go-
rdon, who also said it is unusual
for a W&L production to get so
many reservations so early.

For reservations, call the Henry
Street Playhouse box office, 463-
8637, from 10 a.m. io 5 p.m. Mo-
nday through Friday.

the second recording. Both songs
feature drums, which helps give
them a fun sound, as opposed to
the more serious acoustic book-
ends.

Lies concludes with the master-
piece "One in a Million", an un-
compromising comment on anony-
mous white boy angsi. The song
begins with a carefree acoustic riff
(complemented by whistling), but
quickly tums dark by introducing
morroccos and a menacing sound-
ing electric rhythm acoustic guitar.
Another musical highlight is SI-
ash’s Spanish-flavored solo about
two-thirds of the way through.
As far as the subject matter goes,
the band explains, it is best on the
album cover:

“Ever been unjustly hassled by
someone with a gun and a badge-
..been tO a convenience store and
treated like you don’: belong here
by an individual who can barely
speak English? Hopefully not, but
have you ever been attacked by a
homosexual? Had some so-called
religionist try to con you out of
your hard-eamed cash? This song
is extremely simple...my apologies
to those who may take offense.”’

Clearly, Guns N’ Roses is a
widely talented band, musically
and lyrically, as the supposed
"snack", GN'R Lies, attests. It re-
mains to be seen whether they
will go on to fully realize their
immense promise, or mercly burn
out on the fast lane of rock n’
roll.

Sessoms added, ‘‘Alumni adore
coming back when the students
are here. They really want to see
things in full session.”’

weekend is a time when the alum-
ni board of directors can meet.
‘*The 20 member alumni board of
directors only meets twice a year:
at Homecoming and_ Reunion
Weekend. The board has a full
three-day agenda, in addition to
the other reunion activities sched-
uled.”’

The weekend’s activities will
begin on Thursday evening at 8:30
p.m. with the opening reunion as-
sembly in Lee Chapel. Edgar F.
Shannon Jr., ’39, former president
of the University of Virginia and
a member of the W&L Board of
Trustees from 1974-1986, will be
the guest speaker.

Sessoms said, ‘‘We try to get
a speaker that will really attract
the alumni back for Thursday

Sessoms said last year students
had a strong showing at Philip
Labro’s lecture and he hopes they
will come out for Shannon’s talk.

In addition to the traditional
receptions, banquets and meetings,
returning alumni will have the op-
portunity to attend several infor-
mational sessions and panel dis-
cussion groups pertaining to a
wide range of topics.

Jim Farrar Jr., associate alumni

secretary, said, ‘‘We strive to
reach that balance between the
social and the substantive. In

keeping with the goals of the uni-
versity, we try to provide things
that are timely and of interest to
our alumni.’’At 4 p.m. on Thurs-

fessor of History, will give a lec-

their guests can attend a program

More applications submitted for Fraternity Renaissance

 

By Michael Badger
Staff Reporter

 

Lambda Chi and Phi Kappa
Sigma are the two latest W&L
fraternities to submit applications
for participation in the University
sponsored Fraternity Renovation
Program. As of yet, neither
, application has been approved by
the Fraternity Renovation Steering
‘ Committee,

The Fraternity Renovation
Program is the most extensive
‘aspect of the Fraternity

Renaissance Program. That
program requires all fraternity
chapters at W&L to bring their
houses into compliance with the
Standards for Fraternities at
Washington and Lee University,
established in the fall of 1987, and
to "maintain the levels’ of
responsibility, safety, and
excellence emphasized _ therein."
In implementing the Renaissance
program the Board of Trustees
hopes to create a more
constructive fraternity environment
than that found at W&L today.

According to Dean of
Fraternities Leroy C. "Buddy"
Atkins, any fraternity chapter that
fails to bring itself into
compliance with those standards
by the end of the Renaissance
program will no longer be
recognized by the University. He
said also that the University will
encourage that chapter's — national
organization to withdraw
recognition of the chapter

front lawn, a seminar on ‘‘Motiva-
tion for Giving and Voluntary Ser
vice’’ by Eugene J. Webb of the
Stanford Graduate School of Busi-
ness will be held in Room 327 of

Each class will hold its own

Farrar said the planning of
alumni weekend was a team effort
by the entire university. He said,
“We realize that alumni come
back to reestablish old friendships,
both with classmates and with the
faculty. They return to the univer-
sity for sentimental reasons, to re
establish ties that have been
important to them over the years.
And I am real pleased with the
program that we have to offer
them.”’

SAB in debt because
of ‘comedy of errors’

 

By Pat Lopes
Staff Reporter

 

The Student Activities Board
(SAB) told the Executive
Committee Monday night that it is
currently $14,000 in debt due to ai
number of miscalculations.

SAB Chairman David Grove
described the events which caused
the debt as "basically a comedy of
errors."

According to Grove, when the
board decided to book Little Feat,
members were under _ the

impression that they had $18,000
to spend. But, miscommunication

between SAB treasurer Mike
Carroll and Fancy Dress
Chairwoman Liz Smith lead to
inaccurate _ ledgers. After

misplaced bills were paid and
ledgers were corrected, the SAB
found themselves with only $2000
to cover the expenses for the
$26,000 Little Feat concert.

OPINION

Welcome home

Many of us who attend Washington and Lee University
today like to think the school has never been better. There
is more than a touch of arrogance in such an assumption,
but those undergraduates bold enough to make such a claim

 

. are not entirely alone; in fact, they are occasionally

supported by alumni. If you believe Robert Mottley, a
member of the class of 1964 whose column appears
elsewhere on this page, W&L is at its height (albeit
perhaps only temporarily).

Of course, if W&L is on an uphill climb, that does not
denegrate the W&L men and women who preceded us.
They and the work they did here are the main -- and
perhaps only -- reasons their alma mater continues to
improve. If all those who proudly display W&L diplomas
added something to this place during their college days, if
each of them left General Lee’s college a little better than
they found it, then their alma mater has, quite literally,

‘ never been better.

Thus change, at a school students care about, is a good

_ and certain occurance. As W&L English professor and

. hot a lament for past times,

alumnus Sidney Coulling said far better than we ever
could, ‘‘Washington and Lee, like the rest of the world,
has changed. The helpful response to this fact, however, is
but a willingness to

- understand the changes that have taken place and to make

“ whatever additional changes may

be desirable in the
future.”’

But much of what makes Washington and Lee the

_ special and successful place it is cannot be improved upon.

>

a

. The Honor System and the Speaking Tradition, we hope

and believe, are far more than traditions, far more than

~’ quaint relics displayed to tourists who visit the Lee Chapel

basement. And, as much as the success of W&L may

_ depend on constant tinkering, adjusting and growing, our

school’s future also rests, to quote Coulling, ‘‘on our

' continuing success in preserving two of the fundamental
_ virtues in our tradition, integrity and civility.’’

So welcome home, alumni. No doubt you will find

., today’s W&L is, in many ways, unlike the one you left
- upon graduation (and we’re certainly not just talking about

coeducation, although that may be the most obvious
alteration). We hope the changes you see have been for the
better.

But we hope you are not blinded by change. We hope
W&L has in some ways been a stubborn, static place,

’ resistent to the relaxation of ideals and standards that has

made the rest of the world a more unfriendly and less

.. honorable place in recent decades. May you find, as B.F.

Harlow ’97 did, that your home is here, your friends are

“here and your treasure and your heart are here. And may
“* you also find that integrity and civility, honor and courtesy,

are also here -- as strong as ever.

Spectator editors

call for EC funds

- OUR VIEW

.. By Paul Lagarde and
_ Ray Welder

~~ avenues for students are sufficient
‘ for the students to voice their opi-

‘ student funds to the Washington
- and Lee Spectator and the appro-

 priations process in general...

 

the Spectator that deals with poli-
tics will be more aligned towards
contemporary issues and will tend
to cover them through a variety of
methods, including short essays,
book reviews, and interviews with
political personalities. Second,
The Ring-tum Phi is more aligned
towards general news, while the
Spectator plans to include investi-
gative articles on various campus
issues. Furthermore, to change
The Ring-tum Phi and the Political
Review to serve as the Spectator
hopes to function would downplay
the legitimate role that these two
publications already play on this
campus.

Another matter that was of
concern to members of the Publi-
cations Board was our “obvious
political agenda’’ that seems to
accompany what we honestly call
a ‘‘conservative editorial policy.’’

tions Board concluded that the
goals of the Spectator could be

W&L today: Wine, women and sex

 

MY VIEW
By Robert Mottley 64

 

I’ve written about Washington and Lee
only once before, in a 1970 column that ap-
peared in The Roanoke World News. ‘“The age
of Aquarius has struck in Lexington, and
clothes no longer make the man at General
Lee’s university,"’ I said then. That sounds
moronic today, but you have to understand the
extreme shock of a '64 graduate who discov-
ered that his well-loved collegiate culture had
completely disintegrated. In my time, only
six years before, a men’s clothing store was
the preferred townie business. Yet I had not
gone ten feet down the Colonnade before en-
countering ‘‘two apparitions from Greenwich
Village. One wore tie-dyed denims, a ragged
shirt, and an Army combat jacket. The other
was dressed in bell bottom trousers, a sweat-
shirt, and buckskin chaps. One had hair that
curled down his shoulders; his friend wore
muttonchop sideburns and an Edwardian
moustache. They had shoes on, but no socks.

I think now I really didn’t get past the
culture jolt, which affected the rest of the
column. A seeming quote from Dr. James G.
Leyburn, ‘‘the Silver Fox’’ himself, who
praised ‘‘an intellectual zeal among the stu-
dents’ and said the change in fashion had
“erased any distinction between rich and poor
youths,’ somehow became linked to a less
lofty comment by an unnamed professor: ‘‘I
don’t let them into class if I can smell ’em
coming down the corridor.’ (I can now re-

veal that the anonymous source was Dr. Keith
Shillington, whose olfactory skills, developed
in laboratories, were unrivaled on the faculty.
And yes, I suppose that Leyburn would be
mortified to be quoted in the same paragraph
as Shillington. But, Leyburn had pegged me
as a steady B+, never quite of the purple,

  

CRC: Handle
with care

To the Editors:

Guys -- picture the scene. It’s a Satur-
day night party at your fraternity house.
You’ve had a few beers with your buddies
and you're having a great time. Unique
huh? Well now it’s Tuesday and you’ve
been summoned to go before the infamous
CRC. Why? Hell if you know!

There have been jokes about this happen-
ing since before the CRC started hearing
cases, but rumor has it that the jokes are
becoming a reality. I’m not criticizing the
institution of the CRC. I believe it serves
an important function that is often ignored.
However, it should not be used for trivial
cases loaded with double standards.

Girls/Women, before you take a guy be-
fore the CRC, ask yourself if you’re taking
action because:

1) You fooled around with a guy and
now he doesn’t want you as a girlfriend.

2) You think the guy is a real jerk.

3) To make an example showing other
guys what a powerful weapon the CRC is.

4) To get attention.

OR 5) The person in question sexually ha-
rassed you, either physically or verbally, to
an extent that punishment, such as expulsion,
should ensue.

Just as the guys here have a bad reputa-
tion for being male chauvinist and vicious
date rapists, W&L females have the reputa-
tion for being militant feminists (aka female
chauvinists) and for crying ‘‘date rape’’
whenever it’s convenient. Both extremes are
immature and unproductive means of dealing
with the opposite sex.

Women have a long way to go before
they receive equal treatment with men.
“*Tattling’’ to the CRC, however, won’t earn
any more respect than when we “‘tattled’’ to

 

while Shillington had let me through organic
chemistry with a D. It seems cheap revenge
now, but was satisfying then.) I swore after
that visit to Lexington that I would never
return, for reunions or to write again about
the university. I’ve kept the vow about class
reunions, but I did go back to W&L last Oc-
tober for the first time in 18 years.

An ominous intimation of what I would
see came as I coaxed my °75 Pontiac over
Afton Mountain. At a steady 40 mph, we
were passed by a series of horse vans. The
vans turned south on the Interstate at Staun-
ton, and pulled off at the first Lexington exit.
I stopped at an Exxon station outside of town
and changed into a suit. Old habits die hard;

| prefer to think of W&L in
the present tense, and not
just because of that beauti-
ful lady with a sleepy smile.
In truth, | like the place to-
day more than | ever did.

 

 

I would change back to jeans before supper at
my fraternity. Here are the notes I took on
campus that afternoon:

Where do these gorgeous women come
from? Just got a sleepy, friendly, definitely
inquiring look from a lady in a flak jacket
and designer jeans crossing the street in front
of Sigma Nu. In New York, you are lucky to
get a look like that in the fourth month of a
relationship. 1 absent-mindedly follow her
into the street and am nearly run over by a
red Porsche. Classy obituary, anyway, better
than colliding with a horse van.

I see women everywhere. All beautiful.
The guys are beautiful. The huge shepherd
and St. Bernard dogs that roam everywhere
are beautiful. Surely Tina Brown has her
trendy photographers around for Vanity Fair.
No question that W&L has ‘‘the look.’’ Hav-
ing taught as an adjunct journalism professor
at New York University, 1 do miss seeing
faces with ethnic character, or some scowling
misanthrope with bad breath. The homogeniz-

the teacher in elementary school. Unless the
seriousness of the problem demands recogni-
tion by a body like the CRC -- such as
threats or true date rape -- try to confront
the problem yourself. There are a lot of
immature jerks in this world, as well as
some good guys who get wrongfully ac-
cused, but being a jerk isn’t a crime. By
using the CRC for a ‘‘witch hunt’, the ac-
cused will become martyrs while a few girls
stereotype the rest of us. The way I see it,
it’s unfair to both sexes, so think long and
hard before you start making trivial accusa-
tions. Otherwise, you’re probably doing
more damage than good.

Sincerely,
Lynette Goodman

even the governments of Virginia and of the
United States of America, since I received
financial support from both institutions. My
education was not a bootstrap effort. It was
a very precious gift that was given to me by
many, many people. Since I have been for-

To the Editors:

S.M.A.R.T. (Students for Moral Aware-
ness and Responsible Thinking) is the orga-
nization recently formed by a group of mor- | *
ally concerned students. These students are
concerned that a majority of students at
Washington and Lee coming from upper |’
class backgrounds are very much unaware of
the plight of the underclass. Thus, the focal
point of S.M.A.R.T.’s activities will be a |‘
newsletter that provides information about | ,
issues of the underclass. From this spring-
board, §.M.A.R.T. hopes to sponsor lectures, | ‘
benefits, fundraisers, and campus human
rights discussions focusing on these issues.
The major goal of S.M.A.R.T. is that stu- | ‘
dents, because they will receive underclass
knowledge to complement their upperclass
knowledge, will develop a moral awareness | ‘
concerning major issues confronting this | ,
nation. Upon becoming morally aware of
these issues, $.M.A.R.T. hopes to hone these
skills so that Washington and Lee’s gradu- | 4
ating students will be responsible thinkers.

LAGARDE

(continued from page 2)

 

Now perhaps if the Spectator were
to concentrate solely with Ameri-
can political issues, our conserva-
tism could be equated with a po-
litical agenda. The fact is, how-
ever, that a good deal of the Spec-
tator will be devoted to University
affairs, while other parts will con-
centrate on American culture or
other non-political aspects of the
national scene.

Eight members of the Execu-
tive Committee had the same mis-
givings: the Spectator is political
and thus not eligible for student
funds. Executive Committee
member Willard Dumas stated in
the March 23 edition of The Ring-
tum Phi that ‘‘political, social, and
religious organizations that do not
represent the student body as a
whole’ are not eligible for student

same to all these (invisible) unde-
sirable groups just waiting to be
funded?

All the contradictions here are
disturbing. One might speculate
that the Publications Board just
did not want outside competition.
This would not be only idle con-
jecture, however, since the Publi-
cations Board openly admitted that
one of their fears was that the
Spectator would over-saturate the
advertising market causing diffi-
culties for other publications.
Both the economic free market
and the free market of ideas take
a beating with this decision.

More important than the Spec-
tator’s funding obstacles are the
problems with the entire appropri-
ations process. Bureaucratic sna-
fus can pop up at any time the
EC wants them to. For example,
the EC on the night we first came
to them, appeared extremely sup-
portive; they all but promised us
their help. They only wanted to

Obviously, EC funding guidelines are

enforced selectively.

 

funds. We challenge any student
to read the list of student organi-
zations that are funded to see if
they represent the student body as
a whole. Organizations such as
Ariel, Amnesty International, the
Rugby Club, the Minority Student
Association, Trident, and numer-
ous others clearly do not represent
the student body as a whole. But,
these organizations do receive stu-
dent funds and, we would argue,
deserve them. Obviously, the
guidelines are enforced selectively.
Mr. Dumas’ reasoning for delegat-
ing student funds is misguided--as
are the seven other EC members
that voted against the Spectator.
Further, some EC members be-
lieve that if they funded the: Spec-
tator, they would be forced to
fund any and all student organiza-
tions that applied for funds. Ex-
amples of such groups cited to
keep the Spectator from obtaining
funds were a hypothetical gay stu-
dent union or a neo-nazi group.
Now, we wonder, is it really that
difficult to distinguish between an
alternative forum of discourse, and
a group of skinheads or an organi-
zation that advocates unsafe sex?
Moreover, if the guidelines can be
enforced selectively on the Specta-
tor, why can’t the EC do the

check with the Publications Board
to see why we were given “‘provi-
sional’’ recognition. (This was a
term that had never been used be-
fore, and we were given that label
by Publications Board President
Betsy Vegso.) But in our next
meeting with the EC, all sorts of
potential ‘‘problems’’ came up
that were not even considered in
the previous meeting. In the Ex-
ecutive Committee’s zeal for prop-
er ‘‘legal’’ decisions, it has
neglected common sense and set
an ominous precedent for future
student initiative.

The staff and supporters of the
Washington and Lee Spectator be-
lieved that we were eligible for
funds. Although the 8 to 5 EC
vote was discouraging, it will not
stop us from attempting to estab-
lish an alternate forum for student
expression. Our first issue will
appear tomorrow, but we do not
consider it our premier issue. Be-
cause of obvious fiscal restraints--
which we hope to ameliorate with
friendly donations--we were forced
to scale down this issue and in-
clude mostly straight text. It is
our aim to begin next fall with a
high-quality magazine that will not
only make our staff proud, but
also the whole W&L community.

about poltergeists, nasty ones that
haven’t taken to gentrification. In
contrast, the ghosts from the Lee
family tombs in the Chapel no
longer strike fear in Phi Kaps
Staggering down the hill to Red
Square. Two students, a girl and
a boy, laughed at this hoary remi-
niscence. ‘You still see blue
lights and vapors some nights.”’
Then they talk about how crack
isn’t yet a problem in town, about
the emerging aggressively liberal
administration, and finally, one
smasher for a finale. ‘‘You'll

woman president of W&L. And

bahn. I can remember people
who were killed trying to beat 50
minutes.

Someone seems to be making
the Lyric Theatre into a boutique.
I suppose I got my real education
at W&L in the Lyric, where I first
saw La Dolce Vita, The Seventh
Seal, La Strada, and best of all,
Smiles of a Summer Night. They
can all be rented today, but pop-
ping a tape in the VCR doesn’t
bring back the ambience of the
Lyric. Rats rustled down by the
screen, and the bald gnome from
Brooklyn who owned the theatre
would sit impassively in the pro-
jection booth after counting his re-
ceipts. Beckett would use him as
a metaphor for God, seeding the
young with images that could not
be shrugged off. I remember pro-
found conversations with my bud-
dies afterwards, when we were all
loaded just enough to tackle the
questions of life and death.

So, make what you will of
these notes. I think the problem
with most alumni is that they are
looking for what Henry James
called ‘“‘the visitable past.” I
guess you see what you want. I
prefer to think of W&L in the
present tense, and not just because
of that lady with a sleepy smile.
In. truth, I like the place today
more than I ever did.

Sbar’s View Categorical movies could change the world

In a brown-nosing effort to impress my friends,
editors and the Nobel Peace Prize Nominating Com-
mittee I have decided to write an informative and
interesting column on a subject that could one day
decide the fate of the universe-movies. Yes reader,
while you have been busy moving up the career
ladder or getting a law degree, or buying lottery
tickets, I have been sitting around my house with a
VCR watching thousands (maybe millions) of mov-
ies, eating Fruit Loops and drinking Old Milwaukee
Light. Instead of reviewing each movie individually
I have broken them down into movie categories. As
you read my reviews keep in mind that my movie
analysis was formulated with the same complicated
Statistical process used by the famous scientist who
invented Super Glue. Here are the important catego-

time gun fighting until he feels like riding to Mexi-
co in search of gold, Mexican women and an all-
around good time. The majority of cowboy protago-
nists are normally too busy to shower or shave.

Bump and Grind Porn: Because these movies
are mostly self-evident and generally easy to under-
stand they are fun for the whole family. The low
point of porn flick however is that most of the
actors couldn’t have made it past the second round

deranged, sadistic perverted psychopathic drug king-
pen who has killed all of Rocco’s friends and fami-

Foreign Flicks: The trademark of a Foreign
Flick is something Siskel and Ebert call "realism".
What "realism" amounts to is scenes of people using
the bathroom and flossing their teeth. Some Foreign
Flicks have been known to get a little boring.

Rambo Flicks: A movie in which Sylvester
Stallone plays a war veteran who travels to semi-
exotic areas of the world rescuing prisoners who
everyone else thought were killed during the war of
1812. As he travels through dense jungles Rambo
carries more weapons on his back than you could
find in the city of Miami.

Parkins. ‘‘Journalism students feel
part of a large close-knit system
and it is because of her. I know
she will be really missed.”’

 

In addition to games on the
field and good music, there
will be a dunking booth featur-
ing familiar faces on the W&L
campus. President Wilson will
guest star from 3:15 to 3:45

go to help the Rockbridge Ar-
ea Hospice, which gives care
to the terminally ill.

This event is sponsored by
the Independent Union and the
Minority Student Association.
An ‘invitation to attend is ex-
tended to all students.

John Jennings, chairman of the
journalism department, said,
“Florence has been a_ central
member of the department. She
has served as sort of an informal
advisor to students, and has
become almost indespensible to

us.

Cook said the biggest change
that she has seen within the
department is the increase in jour-
nalism majors. She said, ‘‘I think
the department has expanded so
much because of the women,
There could very possibly be a
continual increase in majors.’’

Another change Cook has wit-
nessed within the department is its

relocation. She said, ‘‘When I first
started working here, the depart-
ment was in Payne Hall where
Dean John’s office is now located.
Then Reid Hall was remodeled for
the journalism department and we
moved in around 1969,”’

Cook said the department has
also increased in its number of
faculty members. When she first
started, Cook said, there were only

two or three members and now

there are five,

Cook works from 9 a.m. to 2
p.m. She said, ‘I’ve always
worked the student calendar. I get

student holidays off as well as the«
summer months.”

Use bumper .
to display _
school spirit -

By Allen Ladd y
Staff Reporter

 

y

Virginia’s Department of Mo-
tor Vehicles has created a new
way for Washington and Lee Uni-
versity supporters to show their
school spirit--college emblem _li-
cense plates.

The new plate features the
Washington and Lee crest and
emblem in the center of the tag.
Brian Shaw, W&L director of
communications, said the tags
should be ready sometime this
spring and can be _ purchased
through the D.M.V. ‘

The new auto tags are being
made for colleges and universities
in the state that have approved
them. However, many of the
state’s 78 colleges have not
submitted designs for a new plate
because the $25 fee for the plate
goes entirely to the D.M.V.

The General Assembly
authorized the plates one year aga
but several schools, including the
University of Virginia, may not
have their own tag because they
have not been able to persuade
state legislators to work out a
profit-sharing arrangement. ‘

“Although Washington and
Lee doesn’t receive any of the
money, we see the tags as fred
advertisement,’’ said Shaw. '

Shaw also said that when the
plates are ready a notice will
appear in in the alumni magazine,

The Ring-tum Phi, May 11, 1989

 

EC

(continued trom page 1)

failed to adequately compensate
for the expenses incurred. Grove
said that ticket sales are not
expected to fully compensate for
the cost of events because the
SAB moderates the price of
tickets, paying for a few dollars of
every ticket cost. As a result, the
SAB did anticipate a $7000 to
$10,000 loss; however, the board
sold fewer tickets than they
anticipated, resulting in a $13,000
loss from the Little Feat concert
alone.

Failing to properly budget
other concerts also contributed to
the debt, Grove said. He
explained that funds allocated for
concerts were used to cover band
fees while other expenses, such as
commission for the band’s agent,
security, stage construction and
refreshments, were not considered.
Finally, several of FD bills
received last week pulled the SAB
even further in debt.

EC President Christopher de
Movellan expressed displeasure
with the SAB’s mismanagement of
funds. de Movellan suggested that
members failed to perform
responsibly in their positions. He
specifically cited the inaccessibility
of certain members, who were
involved in a number of other

 

extracurricular activities. de
Movellan suggested that the
1989 - 1990 SAB chairman,

Charles Conklin, carefully monitor
members and dismiss those
members who fail to perform
adequately.

Representatives from Contact,
the Fencing Team, the Political

Review and the Ariel also reported
their budgetary status to EC
members. All groups were found
to be financially stable.

In other EC business, Senior
Robert Owen asked the committee
to consider assisting Reference
Librarian, Public Service Librarian
and Assistant Professor Peggy
Hays. Hays is currently being
considered for tenure at W&L.
Owen said that Hays is in
jeopardy of failing to receive
tenure because of an unfair review
of her work. Owen described Hays
a faculty member willing to go
the extra mile for students with

library services, as well as
personal help. Personality
conflicts and administrative
decisions based on incomplete

information will ultimately harm
W&L students, Owen said, In
order to publicize the issue and
show student support for Hays,
Owen wrote a letter to the editors
of the Ring-Tum Phi which was
published last week and presented
President John Wilson with a
petition signed by 235 students.

Senior EC Representative
Alston Parker agreed to speak
with Head Librarian Barbara
Brown and further investigate the
circumstances surrounding — the
consideration of Hays’ tenure. de
Movellan said that he would speak
with Wilson, Dean of Students
Lewis John and Vice President of
Academic Affairs and Dean of the
College John Elrod. de Movellan
also said he may mention the
matter to the Board of Trustees,
when he dines with them on the

weekend of May 20.
Junior EC Representative
Brandon Canaday updated the

committee on efforts to control the
disappearance of dishes, utensils
and food from walking out of
Evans Dining Hall. At last
week’s meeting, the committee
passed a motion calling for a
warning notice to be printed on

EC stationary, signed by de
Movellan and posted in Evans.
This week, the committee

approved the text of the notice.

Patrons will be reminded that
they can be expelled for taking a
spoon, and the notice will warn
that taking dishes, utensils and
food out of Evans "may be
investigated as a possible honor
system violation."

Sophomore EC Representative
Willard Dumas said that Registrar

Scott Dittman will discuss with
the EC distribution procedures for
grade change forms. Currently
grade change forms are not
released to students. Keeping the
forms out of student hands limits
the temptation to forge a
professor’s signature and commit
an honor violation.

Dumas reported at last week’s
meeting that a professor believed
this procedure _ inappropriately
questioned the sincerity of students
in respect to the honor system.

Senior EC Representative John
McDonough said that on campus
taping footage for an honor
system video began today and will
continue over the next week.
The taping is occurring on
location, at various locations on
campus. The video will be used
to introduce the honor system to
perspectives, freshmen, first year
law students and new faculty
members.

 

REBUILD

 

(continued from page 1)

Once a fraternity’s application
to participate in the renovation
program has been deemed "fully
qualified" by the Renovation
Steering Committee, and its
renovation plans have been
accepted, the University will
advance financing for the
renovation, absorb current
mortgages, and manage _ the

renovations in retum for the title
of the fraternity house. This will
give the University significantly
more control over the maintenance
and regulation of the participating
fraternities.

As a result of this program,
participating fraternities will see
an increase in fraternity rent and
dues. Some of the additional
expenses will include money for
cleaning and maintenance of the
houses.

So far the applications of
Sigma Nu, Beta Theta Pi, Pi
Kappa Alpha, and Sigma Alpha
Epsilon have been accepted by the

Steering committee. The
Renovations will not begin until
March or April of next year.

According to Dean Atkins,
none of W&L’s three sororities
have yet applied. He said that
when the sororities do look to
establish chapter houses, which
may be a few years down the
road, they will have to come to a
uniform agreement so that they
will have equal facilities and will
receive them at the same time.
This agreement will most likely be
made through the Panhellenic
Society.

Netters fall to Hampton
to close regular season

 

The Ring-tum Phi, May 11, 1989

NCAA Tennis ’89:

   

2s me oe aoe ogee ae pea woe ee “a

     
   

 

By Stuart Sheldon
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
men’s tennis team ended its sea-
son Saturday against Hampton Un-
iversity, currently ranked first in
Division _ II. The international
Hampton squad easily handled the
Generals, serving them an 8-1 de-
feat.

The loss drops W&L’s record
to 8-10 on the season. Six of
those ten losses came at the hands
of D-I opponents, including four
straight at the start of the season.

W&L’s only point inthe match
came from No. 1 netter John Mor-
ris. His opponent, Luis
Nascimento, who was a doubles
finalist at last year’s NCAA D-II
Championships, quickly grabbed
the first set from Morris, 6-1.
‘“‘His game threw me off in the
first set,’’ said Morris. “‘He was
chipping my serves back low at
my feet.”’

Morris’ serve and volley game
brought him back, and he tied the
sets at 1-1 by wining the second
6-4. In the second set, according
to Morris, ‘‘I tried to move my
serves around, and get more first
serves in.’’ Morris did what he
wanted, and stayed in the hunt
against the No. 2 D-II tennis play-
er in the nation.

In the third and decisive set,
Morris jumped out in front, but
Nascimento battled hard. ‘“There
were four games that were tied at
30-30,’ Morris said, ‘‘and I won
them all.’’ Morris poured on the
gas, winning 6-2.

With the win, Morris moved
his season-long No. 1 record to
an impressive 16-5, and is ranked
5th in the nation by the Intercolle-
giate Tennis Coaches’ Association
D-III poll. The same poll puts
senior No. 2 man_ Bobby
Matthews (17-4) at No. 7, and fel-
low senior Robert Haley (14-7)
29th.

In doubles action, W&L’s No.

1 pair of Morris and Matthews
lost a match it could have won.
After being up a set (7-5) and two
breaks, the dynamic duo faltered
for a bit, dropping three match
points. The final score in the
match was 5-7, 7-5, 7-5 in favor
of Hampton. Ranked third in the
nation for doubles, Matthews and
Morris end their regular season at
174,

‘The Generals are far from dis-

couraged after the Hampton
match, however. ‘“‘Our team atti-
tude going into the Hampton

match was that it would be a
good warm-up before Nationals,’’
said Morris.

‘‘We scheduled this season to
be challenging and ambitious,”’
said head coach Gary Franke,
‘*And it has paid its dividends."

On Sunday, Franke participated
in a conference call with the other
members of the NCAA D-III
Tournament selection committee.
The group was responsible for
picking and seeding, or ranking,
the ten teams that would partici-
pate in the tournament in Kalama-
zoo, Michigan, next week.

The committee’s final ten
choices, in descending order, are:
University of California - Santa
Cruz [finished 2nd to W&L in
88], Swarthmore (3rd in °88},
Washington College [4th last
year], Kalamazoo [Sth last year],
W&L [numero uno], UC - San
Diego [8th], Sewanee [10th], Po-
mona-Pitzer and Brandeis (neither
sent squads in °88] and Claremont
[finished 9th].

“‘Our team is capable of beat-
ing any other team in the
country,’ said W&L’s  con-
servatively optimistic Franke.
“Some others can too. It only
takes five points on any given
day.”

The team will travel to
Kalamazoo late this week. Team
action will be May 14-17,
followed by three more days of
individual singles and doubles
play, May 18-21. ‘‘W&L is
ready,”’ said Morris.

Once again, The Ring-tum
Phi attempted to help its read-
ers follow the action at the up-
coming National Collegiate
Athletic Association’s Division
III Men’s Tennis Tournament.
Last year, with the games
played right in our own back
yard, you could take the paper
to the courts. If you're read-
ing this issue court-side while
cheering for the Generals, you
are to be admired: you drove
all the way to Kalamazoo,
Michigan.

If you lost big on _ the
Kentucky Derby and are trying
to win it back on tennis, we
have established winner-take-all
odds. Last year we did pick
the Generals to win the whole
show, but this time W&L will
certainly have a tougher road
to traverse if it wants to
defend its national champion-
ship.

Here then is an analysis of
the ten teams selected to par-
ticipate in the NCAA D-III
National Men’s Tennis Cham-
pionships.

UC-SANTA CRUZ
Santa Cruz, California

(80

In this their fifth NCAA
post-season appearance, the Ba-
nana Slugs fugh!] have estab-
lished beyond a doubt that they
are a certified force in Division
III men’s tennis. They have
put together four amazing sea-
sons of play, losing only one
regular season match. The Ba-
nana Slugs are no softies, how-
ever, notching wins this year
over Swarthmore, UCSD,
Emory, Gustavus Adolphus,
and Redlands, who was a tour-
ney regular until several years
ago. ‘‘Our team has had char-
acter all season long,’’ said
head coach Bob Hansen.

“‘We come at people hard
all season long,’’ continued
Hansen. No doubt the ‘Slugs
would relish a match against
W&L, who forced them to
swallow a bitter pill at 11 p.m.
on that rainy Championship
evening in the spring of 1988.

 

A wide open field |
)
|

The Slugs were seeded first in
the '88 Tournament as well.

The charge of the ‘Slug
Brigade will be led by senior
Chad Andrews. Andrews is
ranked 14th by the ITCA.
Chad will be backed by sopho- 4°
more Steve Gottlieb, who the /}>
ITCA placed at the No. 24 po-
sition. Freshman Greg Jarasitis
is No. 49 in the eyes of the
ITCA.

The one chink in the Slugs’
slimy armor: a missing player.
Andrews’ ITCA No. 8 doubles
partner, who was also ranked
27th in singles, had to quit the [°
squad late in the season. The |?
question will be whether or not
the Banana Slugs can fill in

for him? Do they have the +
depth? :
ODDS: 3-1 Sure, the Banana

Slugs have been ranked No. 1
all season, but they held the
same spot last year, too. The
best thing going for this team
is their hard charging, no-holds
barred attack. These Slugs are
also hungry, especially after
coming so close against W&L
(Santa Cruz reached champion-
ship point at one point).
If they can endure three days
of demanding team tennis, they
can win the title. j

SWARTHMORE COLLEGE
Swarthmore, Pennsylvania

TOURNAMENT SEED: 2
ITCA RANKING: 2 (72)

Last year, the Little Quak-
ers were ranked third. At the
end of the 1988 team competi-
tion that is right where they
sat: No. 3. This year, if the
Swarthmore netters don’t want
to stay stoically positioned for
yet another season, they have
only one step up they can |,
make. 1989 Div. Ill wins in-
clude Claremont and W&L. '

Although the Little Quakers «
don’t have a_ singles player
ranked in the top ten, they do
have an alarming depth of °
talent. Junior Andy Mouer ,
shows up as ITCA’s No. 15
player. Mouer is a tall, lean,
well, downright stringy player ¢
who is guaranteed to give his
opponent a tough match, no
matter who it might be. q

Debate ends with Dumas

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA

 

May 18, 1989

 

Finkelstein withdrawal forces question of succession

 

By Pat Lopes
Staff Reporter

 

Capping two weeks of open and closed Executive
Committee meetings, the EC Wednesday decided to
rescind its Monday vote to hold a special election
and will allow Vice President-elect Willard Dumas
to become Washington and Lee’s 1989-90 Student
Body President. That position was vacated when
President-elect Hugh Finkelstein withdrew from
Washington and Lee earlier this month.

The EC’s decision means Vice President-
elect Dumas and Secretary-elect Jon Sheinberg will
assume the positions to which they were elected the
day after undergraduate commencement, as the
Student Body Constitution provides. .

Then, since there will be no president, a
succession of officers will occur, making Dumas
president, Sheinberg vice-president and Senior
Representative-elect Chris Giblin secretary.

A special election this spring will be held to fill
the vacancy that will be left by Giblin. Only rising
seniors will vote, as the election is for the position
of EC senior class representative. Written petitions
signed by 50 students are due in the EC room by
Monday at 5 p.m. At that time, there will be a
mandatory meeting for all candidates. The general
election is set for Wednesday; if necessary, a run-off
election will be held Friday, May 26.

The decision to allow a succession of officers
was reached after several weeks of debate
concerning how to fill the approaching vacancy in
the office of the president-elect. At the heart of the
controversy was the Student Body Constitution,
which doesn’t give a procedure to follow if a
president-elect should withdraw from school before
actually taking office.

At Monday’s meeting of the EC, President
Christopher de Movellan described two possible
procedures.

First was the succession procedure _ finally
adopted at the Wednesday meeting; the second
procedure was for a special presidential election held
either during this term or at the start of fall term.
Both procedures were considered in a closed-door
EC meeting last week and then in three nights of

open-door meetings on Monday, Tuesday and
Wednesday of this week. A large number of
Students attended the open-door meetings and

discussed the procedural options with EC members.
Students filled the gallery, sat on the floor, carted in
= from other rooms and spilled out into the
all.

Because Second-Year Law Representative Dan
DuPre and Third-Year Law Representative Dave
Nave were unable to attend the Monday night
meeting and because of the narrow 5-4 passage that
night of the motion calling for a special election, de
Movellan arranged for a second round of debate on
Wednesday.

At the Wednesday meeting, Giblin stated that if
there was a special election, he would not run again
for president. Giblin made an unsuccessful bid for
the office earlier this year during the regular March
elections,

Sophomore Class President Tom Spurgeon
summed up the spirit of the debate when he said,
“‘Can we do this, is as important as should we do
this?’’ Clauses in the constitution could be tound to
support any number of options; as a result, the
consideration of what was in the best interest of the
school provided the most compelling arguments for
and against elections and succession, Spurgeon said.
De Movellan, Sophomore Representative John
Fialcowitz, First-Year Law Representative David
Cobb, Third-Year Law Representative Dave Nave
and Bar Association President John Falk all stressed
that a spring election would be problematic because
of the absence of the law students, who finished
final examinations last week and left town for

Academics v. athletics

What price success?

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

It was two years ago when the
issues were put to rest; when the
questions were answered; when
there were no longer any doubts
in people’s minds about the future
of Washington and Lee lacrosse.

The Generals had just soundly
defeated Roanoke in the opening
round of the Division III National
Championship Tournament, and,
although W&L would lose in the
semifinals to Ohio Wesleyan, a
new era was dawning. Long gone
were the four consecutive losing
seasons suffered while the pro-
gram competed at the Division I
level under a non-scholarship Di-
vision III policy. The downward
move from Division I had been a
hotly debated one, but the support-
ers of the change had one strong
argument — in Division III, they
said, W&L would be able to seri-
ously contend for a national cham-
pionship against schools _ that
would be operating under the
same rules and = same
student-athlete philosophy. Atter
such a successful debut, their ar-
guments appeared to have been
proven. Washington and Lee
would be a “thool to be reckoned
with come spring time on the la-
crosse field.

Now, after seasons with 2-11
and 4-9 records, the question is
not whether the Generals will
challenge for the national title, be
selected for the tournament, or
even win the Old Dominion Ath-
letic Conference. Now, the ques-
tion is; What is wrong with the
W&L lacrosse program?

It is a question that begets
even more questions. Is it the
coaching? What about the sched-

ule? Can blame be placed on the
admissions department? The ques-
tions are easy to come up with,
but the answers are not so readily
apparent.

W&L’s athletic teams have not
exactly floundered this past year.
The 19 teams compiled a
165-117-3 record. Of the 12
men’s teams, nine had winning
records. Three captured con-
ference championships. One of the
teams with a losing record, men’s
tennis, received a bid to the na-
tional championships. Two teams
finished in the top eight in the na-
tion in their respective sports
(men’s tennis fifth; men’s swim-
ming eighth). On the women’s
side, four of the seven programs
posted winning seasons with two
conference championships, one
from a team with a losing record
(women’s swimming).

The fact that W&L has experi-
enced any kind of success at all in
intercollegiate athletic competition
is no accident. Indeed, according
to. Athletic Director William
McHenry, the objective of the
W&L athletic department is to
provide more than just an avenue
for students to participate in
sports.

“‘T feel it is extremely impor-
tant that we have a successful ath-
letic program in order to make
[W&L] a good experience for the
student-athletes and for the stu-
dents in general,’’ McHenry says.
‘Certainly the goals of any athlet-
ic team is to have a winning sea-
son; to compete for the conference
championship and to be able to
challenge the best athletes and
best teams at the highest level
they can achieve — whether it’s a
regional or national champ-

If the Washington and Lee Al-
umni Fraternity Council has its
way, kegs have become a thing of
the past at W&L fraternities.

The AFC Saturday voted to
urge the house corporations of
W&L’s 16 fraternities to ban com-
munal sources of alcohol, includ-
ing kegs.

Saturday’s decision comes sev-
en months after the AFC called on
the W&L Intra-Fraternity Council
to ban the use of house funds and
the pooling of funds for the pur-
chase of alcohol.

At that time, the IFC went
along with the ban on using house
funds to buy alcohol but did not
prohibit the pooling of funds, ac-
cording to Leroy Atkins, W&L’s
dean of fraternity affairs. Saturday,
however, the AFC reiterated its
opposition to the pooling of

Trustees

The Washington and Lee Uni-
versity Board of Trustees will
meet Friday and Saturday to ap-
prove next year’s budget and the
degrees for this year’s graduates.

“The board meets three times
a year, once in October, once in
late January or early February and
always in late May,’’ said Farris
Hotchkiss, secretary to the board.
‘Particularly important at the spr-
ing meeting is the approval of the
university’s budget for the ’89-’90
academic year and the approval of
the graduates from the recommen-
dation of the faculty.”’

The Board of Trustees has 30
members, four of which are wom-
en, said Hotchkiss. He said mem-
bership is divided into six com-
mittees, including academic, cam-
pus life, planning and develop-
ment, budget and audit, investment

Washington and Lee honored three distin-
guished alumni during ceremonies at Lee
Chapel on Saturday. The three recipients of

funds — as well as the use of
chapter funds — for the purchase
of alcohol.

While the AFC does not have
direct authority over W&L’s fra-
ternities, all of the 16 house cor-
porations will probably adopt the

AFC’s recommendations, accord-
ing to Atkins. At least two
houses — Sigma Alpha Epsilon

and Sigma Nu — have already.
Many W&L fraternities already
falls under similar rules through
their national organizations. Ac-
cording to Atkins, Kappa Alpha
Order, Lambda Chi Alpha, Phi
Kappa Psi, Pi Kappa Phi, Sigma
Nu and Sigma Phi Epsilon are all
members of the Fraternity Insur-
ance Planning Group, or FIPG.
According to the FIPG’s Risk
Management Policy, ‘‘No alcohol-
ic beverages may be purchased
through the chapter treasury,’ and
the purchase of alcohol for mem-
bers or guests may not be ‘‘under-
taken or coordinated by any mem-

meet for

and nominating. ‘‘That is the way
the board does a lot of its work in
those committees,’’ said Hotchkiss.
“The board will spend all day
Friday in committee meetings in
the University Center, and then it
will spend Saturday morning in
Northen Auditorium meeting to-
gether as a whole.”

At this particular meeting, the
board will continue working on
the fraternity renaissance program,
Hotchkiss said. Under the $10
million program, 16 fraternity
houses will be completely reno-
vated and restored. The program
will be financed through university
funds, with roughly half the uni-
versity’s advance to be replaced
by gifts and the other half to be
replaced by rentals and a Greek
system fee.

The board will also discuss
preliminary fund-raising plans for
the coming capital fund-raising
campaign, said Hotchkiss.

In addition, the new presidents

ber in the name of or on behalf of
the chapter.”’

FIPG rules also say the use of
alcohol in the chapter house or
“in any situation sponsored or
endorsed’’ by the chapter ‘‘must
be in compliance with any and all
applicable laws.”’

While current FIPG policy
does not specifically ban kegs
from chapter events, the national
tules of at least one W&L frater-
nity do. According to the Sigma
Nu Risk Reduction Policy, ‘*No
chapter may allow a tap system
and/or a keg to be present in the
chapter house, on chapter property,
or at a chapter function.”’

However, according to Sigma
Nu Executive Director Mo Little-
field, his fraternity is not the only
one that considers using kegs a
violation. Littlefield said that, even
if kegs are not specifically banned,
their use by more than one person
would violate FIPG policy, be-

cause of the rule prohibiting the
buying of alcohol by one member
for another or for the fraternity’s
guests,

The six W&L fraternities cov-
ered by the FIPG policy are not
the only W&L houses that are not
allowed to use house funds or to
pool funds for alcohol. Atkins said
Phi Delta Theta, Beta Theta Pi,
Kappa Sigma and Phi Gamma
Delta also have their own policies
banning the use of chapter funds
and the pooling of funds to buy
alcohol. And, according to Little-
field, Phi Gamma Delta and Phi
Kappa Sigma are both moving to-
ward FIPG membership, and Sig-
ma Chi has its own policy that is
virtually identical to the FIPG’s.

The result of this tightened leg-
islation, ‘skins said, is simple.
“Fraternities need to stop acting
like bars,’’ he said.‘‘It’s ludicrous
for our students to think BYOB
means bring your own keg.’’

and the Law Council will make

year,”’

The outgoing president of the

Rush is
‘inevitable’

By Tyler Suiters
Staff Reporter

 

 

A long-range planning com-
mittee has recommended to Presi-
dent John Wilson that fraternity
rush be moved to winter term,
said Interfraternity Council Presi-
dent Kevin Nash.

“I believe that winter rush is
three-to-five down the road,”’ said
Nash, ‘‘I don’t think the fraterni-
ties want it, but that seems to be
the direction it is heading.”’

Associate Dean of Students
Leroy ‘‘Buddy” Atkins said that,
although the committee’s final re-
port will not be completed until
next fall, he feels that a move to
winter rush is ‘‘inevitable.”’

“The subject of winter rush
came up in several committee
meetings and found its way into
the discussion process,’’ said At-
kins. ‘‘There is a strong sentiment
among the faculty that rush should
be moved from fall to winter.”’

Dean of Students Lewis John
said the recommendation must be
approved by President Wilson and
the Board of Trustees before any
action can be taken. “‘If it is ap-
proved, the subject of winter rush
will be turned over to the IFC, the
Student Affairs Committee and the
faculty for direction.”

Nash said the success of the
sororities’ winter rush will be a
major factor supporting a
campus-wide winter rush, *‘Anoth-
er important factor is the improve-
ment of the 1988 freshmen
pledges’ fall term grades since
pledgeship was deferred until win-
fer.

Atkins said the current rush
system is ‘‘a combination of Jaws
and Mardi Gras. It’s a feeding
frenzy for bodies. It leads to bad
will with the community and ani-
mosity between the students and
the faculty. Freshmen get the

} wrong perception of the fraterni-

lies.

THE STUDENT VOICE OF WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

 

A bad decision
wisely reversed

The withdrawal from Washington and Lee of Execu-
tive Committee President-elect Hugh Finkelstein shocked
the university community. Suddenly, the chief Honor
System custodian for 1989-90, the leader-elect of an
1800-member student body, was gone. Finkelstein’s
withdrawal was an invitation for chaos, and, Monday
night, the EC answered that invitation. Then, Wednesday,
|, Teason returned to the University Center, in the form of
... @ 10-1 vote that will allow Willard Dumas, by succes-
sion, to become W&L’s next student body president.

First, the Monday night fiasco. Since the Student Body
Constitution includes no specific provision for replacing

the president-elect, the EC ended up spending more than

“two hours debating how Finkelstein could be replaced.
There were many sides to the debate, but they all boiled
down to this: was Dumas, as vice president-elect, the
student body’s choice to be Finkelstein’s successor? Or,
since Dumas had yet to take office, should a new elec-
“tion be called? A vocal group of students expressed the
_|, latter view, and the committee apparently listened. The
EC voted 5-4 — with Dumas abstaining — to hold elec-
, tions May 26, the earliest possible date — and the last
' day of classes.
‘t© Certainly a case can be made that, with school still in
' session and Dumas still out of Big-Three office, an elec-
|, tion should have been called. Nevertheless, we believe
. the EC should have allowed Dumas to become president.
jc If Finkelstein’s withdrawal had come any time during
the summer or the 1989-90 school year, Dumas would
automatically have taken over. A majority of the student
body elected Dumas vice president, and everyone who
voted should have known that the vice president’s prima-
4, Ty duty is to ‘fulfill the duties of the President in ab-
..sence of the latter, or in case of illness, death or with-
‘}, drawal from the University.”’

‘’ Furthermore, with the law school already out for the
* summer, it would have been amazing if even a single
‘ law student had had the opportunity to vote, let alone
4, Tun. While some undergrads may be indifferent to law
|. students, they are nearly one-fifth of the student body,
and they deserve to be heard, as loudly as they were
‘ when Dumas was elected vice president.

When the Monday meeting began, the EC seemed to
be leaning toward allowing Dumas to become vice presi-
, dent, and then president, on the day after Commence-
|. ment. De Movellan and others were concerned, and
rightly so, about leaving the law school out of a special
|'»election. Nevertheless, something swung a 5-4 majority
‘ in favor of electing a new president.

With that vote, we were suddenly faced with a critical
|, election on the last day of classes. We were faced with
|. compressed campaigns, a hurried election, low turnout
‘and a nightmarish situation of an election on exam Satur-
day if a run-off became necessary. We were faced with
“the prospect of an EC president who, having been
elected so late in the year, would preside at the first EC

meeting he attended.

Finkelstein’s withdrawal was crisis enough. Now, the
: EC had made it even worse.

Then came Wednesday night and a special EC meet-

ing. De Movellan had mustered the troops in his anti-
election campaign. The two law school representatives
who had been absent Monday were in attendance, ready
. tO represent the interests of their constituents — and, we
believe, of the entire student body.
* The common sense that had been strangely absent
from the University Center on Monday returned. After
voting 11-0 to reconsider, the EC voted 10-1 (with Du-
mas abstaining on both votes) to allow Dumas to take
office. A rash decision was rightly reversed.

The wheels of government may grind slowly — but
this time they ground correctly.

Two views of the Spectator

A forum for
closed minds

By Laura C. Taylor

 

 

AUTHOR'S NOTE: The following is a
response to The Spectator, which failed
miserably in its attempt to provide ‘‘lively,
intelligent commentary’’ and instead only took
lame potshots at liberals, photographers,
women, and the faculty.

Once upon a time, in a small village not
far from a medium-sized city in the Virgin’s
commonwealth, lived a family of free thinkers,
who went to the local college, McCarthy &
Nixon University. These weren’t just any
ordinary free thinkers; these were free thinkers
that believed in an individual’s right to think
for himself. They weren’t free thinkers
because their father was a free thinker, or
because they might lose their inheritance (even
free thinkers can be wealthy), but because
they wanted to be free thinkers. And what did
they think about so freely? They thought that
ordinary people, just like themselves (being
free thinkers, they. never thought that they
were better than anybody else, not even the
close-minded thinkers), should be permitted to
live their own free lives, yet, when they
needed help, it would be available.

Unfortunately, these free thinkers lived in a
tightly controlled society that prevented them
from thinking freely. The people in charge of
this society were the evil close-minded
thinkers, who attempted to destroy any
semblance of creativity or individuality that
might dare to raise its head above the slime.
These close-minded thinkers dressed alike, the
men wearing navy coats, button-down oxford
shirts, Loontail pants, and loafers with no
socks, and the women wearing _ their
boyfriends’ boxer shorts undemeath pinafores,
and no shoes. All of them carried lacrosse
sticks everywhere they went, and drove
OMW’s (Old Money Wagons). They all
majored in history, politics, or business, but

Confronting
discrimination

To the Editors:

As an English teacher, I spend a lot of
time thinking about the rhetorical dimensions
of writing: the meanings of various choices
in manners of written expression. One of
the most rhetorically suggestive and self-pro-
tective writing devices, to my mind, is the
use of the passive voice. Choosing the pas-
sive instead of the active voice enables a
writer, consciously or unconsciously, to
fudge an apparently definite position, to dis-
tance himself from conclusions whose impli-
cations he may not be ready to embrace
fully or even to recognize.

In his ‘‘My View’’ column in the May 4
Phi, D. Ross Patterson chooses the passive
voice repeatedly. ‘‘Minorities’’ (presumably
individual members of ethnic minorities)
‘were discriminated against’; ‘‘equal oppor-
tunity legislation was instituted’’; “‘deserving
minority students’ achievements are cheap-
ened’. Specifying who performed this dis-
crimination and who introduced this legisla-
tion and how would make Mr. Patterson’s
sentences more direct, surely a goal of all
persuasive writing. But specifying who
cheapens ‘‘deserving minority students’
achievements’’ would seem to me to con-
front a key issue that his argument skirts but
does not directly address.

Who possesses these attitudes that deni-
grate the achievements of ‘‘deserving minori-
ty students’’? Among whom do these un-
fairly critical attitudes ‘“‘prevail,’’ and to
what extent? Surely the possession of these
unexamined ‘‘attitudes’’ that Mr. Patterson
assures us ‘‘prevail’’ among unnamed social

 

took Professor Abraham Lincoln Fudge’s
‘*Bishops for Idiots’’ class because he was the
Lord of the Close-Minded Thinkers’ Society,
and thought all free thinkers (and some
women) should be thrown into the sewer with
the Communists.

However, free thinkers began to infiltrate
the ranks of the close-minded thinkers; in fact,
the free thinkers were breeding like rabbits!
To prevent any further corruption of their
beloved university, the close-minded thinkers
devised a plan to utterly ridicule and humiliate
the nasty free thinkers: they would publish a
newspaper that would prove the superior
intelligence of the close-minded thinkers! To
be certain that this plan would be executed
properly, the close-minded thinkers elected one
of their brightest members, Phil Labarge, who
had voted for Richard Nixon when he was

But because the close-minded thinkers were
so close-minded, they could not think of any
witty insults with which they could deride the
free thinkers. All they could do was to call
them names. ‘‘Lily-livered liberals,’’ cried
out the new paper, The Big Brother; ‘‘(Our
faculty] lost the political battle and are waging
war to brainwash the students of our
generation!’’ The close-minded thinkers were
a laughingstock, even among their own kind.
In seeking to eliminate free thinking, they had
proved their own ineptness. Within a few
short years, McCarthy & Nixon University
became Jefferson, Jackson, and Hoffman
University, named after Tom, Jesse, and
Abby, three great free thinkers, and the world
was safe for free thinking forevermore.

groups or individuals is more of a problem
than the accomplishments of those deserving
students.

Color and sex blind admissions may be
the goal Mr. Patterson desires, but I fail to
see how we can reach that standard of abso-
lute objectivity if we can’t even honestly
describe and accurately ascribe the racist
reactions that both follow affirmative action
policies and necessitated their introduction.

Fraternities or
sororities ?

To the Editors:

I am writing conceming an ad in last
week’s Phi. The ad congratulated Kappa
Alpha Theta Fraternity. There is no Kappa
Alpha Theta fraternity on campus that I am
aware of. There is however a sorority that
goes by that name. Let’s remember fraterni-
ties are made up of men. Sororities, on the
other hand, consist of women. I know this
is the eighties but let’s not get to pushy, and
please, let’s use the correct terms.

Sincerely,
Peter J. Coleman
Retired Fraternity President

EDITOR'S NOTE; While The Ring-tum

we appreciate Mr. Coleman's letter, because
it gives us an opportunity to explain why the
copy in the ad was correct, and to explain
our style for referring to W&L'S three Greek-

A defender of
tradition and
student rights

By Erick H. Rock

 

 

I would like to thank the founders of the
Washington and Lee Spectator for offering a
forum in which students can offer and
exchange views on both national and campus
topics. Although the first issue had minor
glitches in format, the overall content of the
magazine was excellent. In particular, I
believe the Spectator highlighted some
disturbing trends on this campus, among them
the demise of the speaking tradition.
Comments by alumni this past weekend only
confirm the validity of this complaint and the
need for the resurrection of this tradition. To
the best of my knowledge, while I have been
at Washington and Lee, no publication has
dared to specifically attack the encroachment
by faculty on student affairs as the Spectator
did in its commentary section. It was long
overdue, well worded, and written with a
genuine concern for the future of this
university. While the Ring Tum Phi does a
fine job with its focus on reporting campus
news it must remain neutral. The editorial
section of the Phi is simply too limited to
consistently voice the many issues that the
Spectator can handle. The Political Review,
although very well written, concentrates on
national topics.

The need for a publication such as the
Spectator is obvious. It provides a means of
student discourse on topics ranging from na-
tional legislation to new university rules.
Perhaps by allowing new avenues for student
opinion to be expressed we can help eliminate
the apathy which now exists on campus. I
agree with last week’s ‘YOUR VIEW’’ in the
Phi by Paul La Garde and Ray Welder and I
wish them luck in their next» issue.

letter women's organizations. Those groups
are chapters of Chi Omega Women's Fra-
ternity, Kappa Alpha Theta Fraternity and
Kappa Kappa Gamma Women's Fraternity.
Newspapers do not name organizations; or-
ganizations name themselves. Therfore, we
will refer to these groups by their self-
appointed names in our news columns. The
term “‘sororities’’ will be used only in the
generic sense or in headlines.

Triathlon story
corrected

To the Editors:

I would like to bring to your attention a
mistake in last week’s edition of the Ring
Tum Phi concerning the Theta Triathlon.

In the third paragraph of the cover article
headed ‘‘Theta sets triathlon for May 20,”’ I
am referred to as the person “‘...in charge of
the event....’” I would like to clarify this by
saying that Heather Logan is in fact heading
the project, and she has been instrumental in
its full planning and organization.

Coeducation and the Class of ‘89

 

MY VIEW
By Kevin Struthers

 

As a member of Southern
Comfort, I travelled to seven
Washington and Lee alumni
chapters throughout the South
during February break of my
freshman year. The hot topic of
conversation among the alumni
was, of course, coeducation. Being
the only freshman in the group, I
was perhaps a little naive, even
that late in the year, to what all of
the uproar meant to the university.

There is no denying the fact
that Washington and Lee is a
better institution academically due
to coeducation. Back in February
of 1986, President John Wilson,
Alumni Director Dick Sessoms,
Development officer Farris
Hotchkiss, and _ then-Assistant
Alumni Director Buddy Atkins
made every attempt to spout pro-
coeducation dogma to alumni in
some very strong Washington and
Lee alumni chapters (including
Houston, Dallas, and Atlanta).
They wanted to stress that yes, the
university had made the right
decision in allowing women to
enter W&L and yes, coeducation
was just great back on campus.
**All one has to do is to compare
the grades of the women and the
men of the university,’’ these
administrators seemed to push,
“and better yet, the Class of ‘89’s
scores to those of the rest of the
‘single sex’ classes, to see that
coeducation is working!’’ Back on
campus the same type of
comparisons were being made by
everyone, including the faculty.

Everything is best’ in
moderation, as the old saying
goes. Everything in moderation.

In comparing the grades of the
women (all 100 of them) to the
1400 or so other students at the
university, the administration did
not help anybody make the
coeducation transition any easier.
The men of the Classes of ‘86,
‘87, and especially ‘88 became
known as the ‘“‘stupid’’ men who
were admitted to a single sex
college with low admission
standards. And what of the men
of the Class of ‘89? We were
tossed aside as ‘‘Oh, they’re the
ones that came in with the
women, aren’t they....’’ Thus, the
upperclassmen became even more
angry — and their anger often
became focused on the women of
our class — over coeducation and
what it meant to them: most of
them had enrolled not knowing
that the institution from which
they would graduate would be
coeducational. Why should they,
as students, have had to deal with
such comparisons, made by the
very people who wanted
coeducation to work in the first
place? The most ironic part of the
whole situation is that by
comparing grades, the mood and
attitude of the administration was
indirectly set for the next four
years: ‘‘the women were academic
goddesses who could do no wrong.

A college education was strictly
academic, right? After all, life
exists only within the classroom."’
The academic standards of the
university were not raised due to
the women of the Class of ‘89,
they were raised due to the 1984
decision by the Board of Trustees
to make our __ institution
coeducational. When the admission
standards increased due to a
larger applicant pool, the
standards increased across the
board. The men of the Class of
‘89 were not unacademic morons,
but they sort of became associated
with those ‘‘stupid’’ men of the
Classes of ‘86, ‘87, and ‘88, due
to the excitement generated by the
presence of the women. The
upperclassmen were told that the
Class of ‘89 was doing better than
they ever had, and the men of
these upperclasses therefore
associated this comparison with
the women only, as they were the
ones that seemed to bring about
this grandiose change: _the
administration, by making these
comparisons, also sent a similar
signal to alumni across the nation.
‘*Women were the salvation of
Washington and Lee, and they
brought the institution out of the
depths of despair and academic
laziness.” How do you think that
made the alumni feel? Were their
degrees from a single sex college
worth less? And what of the Men
of ‘89? Were we just here only to
party and date-rape women as
everybody else in the past had
apparently done, according to the
attitude of the ‘‘old’” W&L,
before September 1985? Of course
not: we ‘89 males entered with a
new academic standard, also. This

fact has been sadly overlooked, *

however, and is still overlooked
today. Mistakes of four years ago
are sometimes hard to correct.

For example, on a tour with
the W&L Choral groups this past
spring break, again to various
W&L alumni chapters, I met a
Board of Trustees member who
blindly possessed this similar
‘*Women as salvation’’ attitude,
which I hope is not shared by
everyone else on the Board.
During a conversation about the
increased academic standards of
W&L, this man said ‘‘Yes, those
women sure are smart.’’ I looked
at him and said, ‘‘Yes, they are
smart. But they are not directly
responsible for the new academic
environment at Washington and
Lee — for we all have entered
under higher standards — men and
women alike.’’ Are the men of
less intellectual value to the
university?

If coeducation is working, why
must a comparison be made?
Doesn’t that just fan the flames?
Even just last week, in the Phi,
the sororities and fraternities were
compared academically once again.
The difference between the
average GPA of the top sorority
and the top fraternity (of which I
am a member) were just a few
tenths of a percentage point apart.
What was the emphaisis of the
article? That the sororities were

higher than the fraternities. A
quote from an underclassmen in

“‘Talk Back’’ consisted of
something like ‘‘I guess the
women are just smarter.’’ Does
this really help anybody?

xe KK

Coeducation has done a great
deal of positive things for the
university. I applaud President
Wilson for his effort to make
coeducation a reality against
strong opposition. Coeducation
was a good move for W&L, but
at what price to the institution?
The women per se are not
responsible for the adverse
changes in the university, they
(like the men) are simply part of
the ‘‘new’’ W&L_ which

 

emphasizes academics on a higher
level. Is our reputation as one the
nation’s great teaching colleges
more important than a change in
the W&L atmosphere, however?

Gone are the days of the
Speaking Tradition. I don’t know
where they went, but it seems that
the camaraderie of the student
body has diminished  noticibly
within the past four years. I for
one understand that everybody has
a bad day once in a while, but
what’s wrong with a simple hello?
Are the sexes afraid that they are
coming on too strong to each
other just by making eye contact?
Or is it that everyone is too
worried about the test they must
take, or the pape: they must write,
or the Professor they must talk
as

The diversification of the
student body due to coeducation
(including the admission of
students from different regional,
economic, and social backgrounds)
after the Fall of 1985 has shifted
the political and social attitude of
W&L in a more mainstream
direction. This again, is not due
just to the admission of women,
but rather a different applicant
pool. This diversified atmosphere
is better for a new, expanded
academic environment which
fosters learning, and is in fact a
more healthy environment for
transition into the world outside of
W&L. I do not agree with the
extreme attitude of the traditional
Southem ‘‘Good OI’ Boy,” but I
do respect it, and can live within
its boundaries. I also disagree with
radical feminist dogma, as I
consider myself fairly openminded
when it comes to women’s issues
and am offended when, as a W&L
male student, it is assumed that I
hate anything remotely ‘‘pro-
womari.’’ What must be found is
a happy medium.... Everything in
moderation is best, right?

I am not happy with the
stereotypical idea of the men of
W&L as ‘‘good ol’ boy, bigoted,
anti-female, _let’s-party-and-trash-
the-fraternity-house so we can
laugh at the Hill’’ males out to
dominate the world. If the
administration wants to work with
the men of W&L in a
coeducational era, it must alter
their attitudes. Some of the W&L
women, too, might wake up and
realize that the entire student body
has been diversified, and no
longer do the attitudes of the
“‘old’’ W&L exist in such great
quantities, Everything is changing.
But in the same vein, I do
understand that all of the women
of W&L are not radical feminist
Gloria Steinham wanna be’s,
either. The administration would
have to be living in a time warp
to think that the women of W&L
have agreed totally with the
administration’s handling of the
entire coeducation affair, when
sometimes (such as in the case of
the grade mess, for instarice) the
administration has gone overboard
in trying to make the women feel
comfortable, at the men’s expense.
The men of W&L also might
want to alter their attitudes that
women here are all out to prove
themselves as women first, and
W&L students second. For this is
not true either.

The friendly, enjoyable attitude
of W&L students towards each
other has fallen by the wayside, as
W&L’s classroom has turned into
a cutthroat environment of ‘‘I
must get an ‘A’ in this class, I
must get an ‘A.’ The men and
women of the university seem to
scramble about, defending and
attacking attitudes which aren’t
n ily those of the majority
of students. It’s an unfortunate
Situation.

To become ‘‘one of _ the
nation’s great teaching colleges,’’
why must W&L strive to be
labelled “‘the new ‘this’ or ‘that’

Ivy League school of the South?”’
Why can’t it just be Washington
and Lee of Lexington, Va. — its
own, unique university? Must the
students of this university be
constantly be in competition with
each other?

Our most important and
cherished tradition — the Honor
System — has luckily —_ been

preserved throughout all of the
school’s many changes. It appears
that this time honored legacy has

not, nor is in danger of
disappearing.
eek eK
The coeducational transition
period is not over. President

Wilson, through his address at the
ODK/Founder’s Day ceremonies
this year, has shown that he is
indeed concemed, and rightfully
so, with the attitudes and actions
of certain factions of our
university. But is it right (to
assume that anti-coeducation T-
shirts, for instance, should not
surface every once in a while,
since their are still smoldering
ashes of the coeducation forest
fire which swept through
Lexington in 1985? ;

With any amount of change,
there is friction and hostility. The
faculty and administration should
realize that 236 years of an all-
male tradition (no matter how
hard the administration may try)
can’t be swept away in a matter
of moments. Tite
anticoeducationalists have just as
much right to voice their opinions
as the procoeducationalists. We
should not discriminate against
anybody.

As June 1 approaches and
Anne Coulling prepares to write
her graduation article for the
alumni magazine and President
John Wilson prepares his
graduation speech, let us hope that
the members of the Class of ‘89
and the alumni of this university
are not forced to once again have
coeducation the emphasis of talk
regarding commencement. The
W&L magazine summer issues of
the past three years have each
played up ‘‘‘this’ or ‘that’ historic
graduation.”’ I'd like to say one
thing: we are all students, at this
university - equal students. If
coeducation is working, why must
it still be an issue? Doesn’t the
Class of ‘89 stand for anything
else? Have we not been an
outstanding Class beyond
coeducation? Have we not suffered
enough? Can’t we leave with
some dignity?

I hope that Brian Shaw of the
News Office requests that hordes
of the press not be allowed to
cover commencement exercises
this year. It is not appropriate that
the Class of ‘89 leave W&L in
the same manner which we
entered: with press coverage
emphasizing coeducation. As a
member of the Class of ‘89, |
think that the women, and men
(yes, Virginia, there are men in
our class!) deserve better

 

 

Pub Board chief explains policy for new publications

 

By Betsy Anne Vegso

 

In view of the recent requests for recognition
of proposed publications by the Publications Board
(including the Spectator and the Southern
Collegian), and the probability of future requests,
the following addendum has been drafted for
inclusion in the Publications Board Constitution.
The addendum has been approved — unopposed —
once, and is expected to be confirmed at the next
meeting of the Pub Board, scheduled for May 22.

1. The Publications Board will not recognize
any proposed or existing publication which states
andlor demonstrates a_ political or cultural
ideology. Whether or not a publication has a
particular ideology shall be determined by a
majority vote of Publications Board members.

2. A proposed publication must fulfill the
following minimum criteria to the satisfaction of
the Publications Board in order to be considered
for recognition:

a. A written mission statement for proposed
publication.

b. A demonstration of how the publication
would fulfill a campus need which is not and
cannot be fulfilled by existing publications.

c. A proposed operating budget for first two
issues, included wherein:

-proposed size (# of pages, frequency of
publication)

-list of contracted advertisers and other
financial contributors

-printing costs

-roster of editors and staff members

-proposed topics, story ideas

d. Upon fulfillment of these criteria, as
determined by the Publications Board, the
publication will be granted 50% of operating costs,

not to exceed $500 per preliminary issue.

3. As a result of this grant, two consecutive
issues must be completed in one academic year,
produced on deadlines determined in advance by
mutual consent of the Publications Board and the
publication.

“The Publications Board will
not recognize any proposed or
existing publication which
states and/or demonstrates a
political or cultural ideology.”’

4. Upon fulfillment of items 1, 2 and 3 above,
to the satisfaction of 2/3 of the Publications Board
members, recognition will be granted. Until the
publication fulfills these criteria, recognition will
not be granted.

5. Recognition by the Publications Board
grants the publication the following:

a. Full voting membership to the Publications
Board, as described in the bylaws of the
Publications Board Constitution.

b. Notification of the Executive Committee of
the recognition of the new publication by the
Publications Board.

By setting up these procedures, we are
demanding from the proposed publications a
demonstration of serious commitment and
understanding of the responsibilities. We are not
trying to crush initiative. We are trying to help
the EC in determining whether or not allocation of
student-body funds is appropriate for proposed
publications.

There are several things to realize about the
five existing student-run publications. They are
meant to represent, individually and collectively,

 

 

the interests and abilities of the student body.
Because the make-up of the student body changes,
none of the publications have rigid guidelines as
to form or content. Each is extremely malleable,
to the extent that they can reflect outstanding
editorial leadership and student input as well as
incompetency and apathy. The only ‘‘check’’ is
the Pub Board, which exists in order to maximize
the quality of the publications and minimize the
problems. My poim is, they are exactly what
students make them. For this reason, we insist on
‘ta demonstration of how the publication would
fulfill a campus need which is not and cannot be
fulfilled by existing publications’’ (2b, above).

For example, had the organizers of The
Spectator pursued available opportunities (i.e. The
Ring-tum Phi, The Political Review) — indeed
only one of the organizers had ever demonstrated
an interest in writing for The Phi — they would
have realized how enthusiastically their articles,
editorials, ‘‘satires,’’ interviews, book reviews,
what have you, would have been received. On one
level, The Phi and The Political Review are happy
to have any submissions which express an opinion
with clarity and skill. On a more fundamental
level, these publications would have been happy to
have the articles because they represented someone
who had the motivation and genuine interest to
actually work on something other than their course
work.

I doubt the majority of the campus realizes —
and I know the editors of The Spectator don’t —
how limited and generally uncommitted the
number of student writers are. It is fairly easy to
eke out the text of a first issue on momentum
alone, but the editors of The Spectator will make
the sad realization that the editors of the W&L’s
existing publications made along time ago: most
W&L students apparently have neither the time

nor the inclination to write anything on a regular
basis that they won’t get academic credit for.
That’s why you see the same handful of names in
The Phi or any of the publications, NOT because
of favoritism or tyranny exhibited by editors.

Besides the limited number of writers, there
are several other problems with the launching of a
new student-run publication on campus. The EC
could spread the money across all the publications
more thinly, which could result in serious
debilitation of all the publications. The sparsity of
funds simply cannot be solved through advertising,
as that market is on the verge of total saturation
because of university solicitation and commercial
efforts. Persistent badgering of local merchants —
and alumni — for funds is unfair and potentially
damaging for our relationships with those groups.
We need to revitalize the publications we have
before we strain our resources by adding another.

The Publications Board is extraordinarily
aware of initiative: those who demonstrate it are
frequently granted editorial positions.

The positions are that easy to get. Had Paul
Lagarde and his associates directed their
substantial energies toward existing publications
this year, they would have been shoo-ins for
editorships. Their input and opinions and
leadership would have been welcomed by the Pub
Board, regardless of any political bias they would
have brought with them. A publication thrives and
becomes educational through editorial diversity,
not on rutted, insular sarcasm which ultimately
only consumes itself. Incidentally, the Pub Board
is currently struggling to fill next year’s Co-editor
position on The Political Review and an Editor-in-
Chief of the 1990 Calyx. I challenge whomever
is dissatisfied with these publications to apply for
these positions, and transform them into exactly
the publication you think W&L needs.

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s Class of 1939 returned to
campus last weekend for _ its
50-year reunion, bringing memo-
ries of the year that ‘‘Gone With
The Wind’’ won Best Picture,
Strains of ‘Moonlight Serenade’’
wafted from the Glenn Miller Or-
chestra and the Axis Powers
gained momentum in Europe.

When the Class of 1939
entered W&L, the United States
was in the depths of the Great
Depression, and when it was grad-
uated ‘‘everyone knew war was
coming and we were marked to
go,’’ said George Goodwin, Pulit-
zer Prize-winning journalist and
member of the Class of '39.

Although the coming war
helped bring an end to the
Depression, it shocked the genera-
tion that thought World War I was
“The War To End All Wars.”’
‘‘Our generation was schooled to
believe war was gone forever,”’
said Cecil Taylor, president of the

1939 Fancy Dress Ball. ‘Our
attitude was that it’s not going to
happen to us.”’

Sadly, it did happen to them.
Twenty-one of Taylor's classmates
died in World War Il, and one
1939 graduate died when Germans
torpedoed the British steamship
‘*Athenia’’ in September, 1939.

On campus in 1939, students
went to class six days a weck
dressed in coat and tie (freshmen
also wore beanies) and spoke to
everyone they passed. Class atten-
dance was compulsory except for
students on the Dean’s List.

As freshmen, the Class of 1939
was not permitted to have cars in
Lexington. Only ten percent of
W&L students had cars, and with-
out cars “‘there was nothing to do
but listen to phonograph records,

play poker, and go to_ the
movies,’’ according to James Mur-
phy, °39.

Most members of the Class of
1939 joined fraternities and ate
their meals at fraternity houses.

Buena Vista to get
Amtrak service soon

 

By Scott Richardson
Staff Reporter

‘‘All aboard Amtrak’’ may be
heard in Buena Vista by the end
of this year, the first time in more
than 20 years that passenger rail
service will be available to Rock-
bridge County.

The Amtrak Cardinal, a train
that runs between New York and
Chicago via Wasington D.C., will
be re-routed through Buena Vista,
City Manager Clay Goodman said.
The train currently runs through
Goshen and western Rockbridge
County, but does not make any
stops.

The re-routing means new Sta-
tion stops at Waynesboro, Buena
Vista and Buchanan, but the elimi-
nation of rail passenger service to
Staunton and freight service to the
Goshen area of Rockbridge Coun-
ty.

Lexington-Rockbridge Chamber
of Commerce President Leroy C.
‘“‘Buddy”’ Atkins said the loss of
freight service would have the
greatest effect on the Burke-
Parsons-Bowlby wood processing
plant at Goshen, which uses week-
ly rail shipments. But, he said

 

the plant does have sufficient
highway access for _ truck
transportation.

Amtrak and CSX_ Transporta-
tion Corp. are concluding negoti-
ations over the construction of the
station platform for Buena Vista,
said Marjorie Dyer, executive sec-
retary of the Buena Vista Cham-
ber of Commerce. Amtrak has
asked CSX to construct the plat-
form, which will probably be lo-
cated directly behind City Hall
between 20th and 21st Streets,
Dyer said.

Amtrak has asked Buena Vista
to provide security, lighting and
snow removal for the platform,
Dyer said. She said before the
negotiations can be completed, the
plan must be approved by City
Council. Dyer also said City

had all written letters of encour-
agement to Amtrak, supporting the
change of route.

The Cardinal, which usually
travels with about eight cars,
makes three round trips weekly
between New York and Chicago,
Amtrak spokesman Clifford Black
said. The westbound train will
stop in Buena Vista between 4:40
and 5 p.m. on Sunday, Tuesday
and Friday. The eastbound train
will stop on Wednesday, Friday
and Sunday at about the same
time.

The Cardinal’s schedule may
be expanded to provide daily ser-
vice, Black said. ‘‘If we can ac-
quire the capital funds to purchase
long-distance passenger cars it
might be possible,’’ he said.

The cheapest round trip ticket
to Washington from the Staunton
stop costs $39, said Betty Collins
of Travel Unlimited. She esti-
mated that several hundred tickets
are sold each year to area resi-
dents and students. The price from
Buena Vista should be about the
same, she said.

‘*The most expensive ticket is
$52, which is cheap if you com-
pare gas costs and parking expen-
ses,’’ she said. ‘‘The Cardinal is
especially helpful to area college
students headed to the Midwest.”’

The Rockbridge Weekly
recently noted the section of rail-
road between Charlottesville and
Staunton, part of which is to be
abandoned, is rich in history. The
book ‘Chessie’s Road’ by Dr.
Charles W. Turner, a retired W&L
history professor, points out that
the line was once part of the Vir-
ginia Central, a vital transportation
link for the South in moving
troops and supplies during — the
Civil War.

secretary
retires

By Joei Dyes
Staff Reporter

 

 

Betty C. Brewbaker, secretary
of Washington and Lee University
President John D. Wilson, is retir-
ing after nearly 18 years of ser-
vice.

She said working for President
Wilson has been a fantastic exper-
ience. ‘‘He is a marvelous person.
Nice to work for. He’s extraor-
dinarily bright; he never forgets
anything...ever.”’

“IT came here as temporary
help. Just a day by day thing. I
worked for Bill Watt (William J.
Watt, Professor of Chemistry) who
was the Dean of the College then.
It was supposed to be a day by
day thing, but it turned into 17
and a half years.”’

When asked how W&L has cha-
nged during the years she has
been here, she said, "I don’t think
it’s changed that much, even when
it went co-ed. Of course, there are
lots more people with the girls,
and the place is a lot more hectic.
Also, it was not as computerized
when I first came here, and we
now have more faculty and build-
ings."

She said that she supported co-
education. ‘‘I don’t think that
girls have changed things so
much. Kids are always competi-
tive. Students studied and played
hard then and they still do. The
girls have fit in real well. They
have done a good job.”’

Brewbaker said the worst inci-
dent she has encountered as_ Wil-
son’s secretary was when a group
of boys had a sit-in in the presi-
dent’s office to protest co-educa-

“Imagine how I felt, walking
into his office one morning and
seeing that 20 bales (of cotton)
had taken over the president’s of-
fice. It was a shock because I
was the only one who had a key,
and he was not going to come in
that day. They, of course, didn’t
know that he wouldn’t be in.
But, they were nice. They didn’t
do anything bad, but the TV

worked for here.’’

Darn, no more checks

 

By Patrick Brown
Staff Reporter

 

Why is it that sometime during
the last month of spring term,
many stores in the Lexington area
stop taking Washington and Lee
and Virginia Military Institute stu-
dents’ checks?

Diane Potter, manager of the
Stop-In Food Store on North Main
Street, said it’s OK to take checks
until April 30 because “‘if any
bounce that they receive, there
will still be time to take care of
it. It gives us time to get our
money collected before the stu-
dents leave for the summer.”’

Potter said, ‘‘I probably have
the largest percentage of checks
returned, and most are from W&L
students.’

She said the W&L Cold Check
Committee paid Stop-In $271.16
last month for bad checks written.

Wayne Moody, an employee at
the Stop-In on Route 60 near the
Keydet General Motel, said he

was told by his manager not to
accept checks from students after
April 30 unless the student is a
regular customer.

“If the student is a regular
customer, his checks will be ac-
cepted until May 15,’’ Moody
said. ‘‘After the 15th, they (the
Cold Check Committee) won’t
guarantee the checks because there
isn’t enough time before the stu-
dents are gone.’’ Moody added
that the Stop-In Food Stores a-
round Lexington do accept checks
year-round from local residents.

Some stores such as Alvin-
Dennis and East Lexington Store
do accept student checks year-
round.

Becky Ayers, an assistant man-
ager at the East Lexington Store,
said, ‘‘Jim (the owner) takes them
year-round because we never have
many problems with them coming
back. Some VMI cadets go to
school here year-round and we
take their checks, so we _ take
W&L checks.”’

Class of ’89 prepares a time
capsule for its 25th reunion

 

By Eleanor Nelson
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee class
of 1989 will be the school’s first
class to organize a time capsule,
which will be opened at its 25th
reunion.

The capsule will contain re-
minders of the class’s four years
at W&L, including t-shirts, bum-
per stickers, pictures, a tape of
popular music and other memora-
bilia donated by class members.
One classmate has suggested plac-
ing a condom and an article about
AIDS in the capsule.

“T was thinking about gradua-
tion, what we'd all be doing in
the future, and how neat it would
be to come back in 25 years and
take a look back at our four years
at W&L,”’ said senior Julie Saler-
no. She came up with the idea

earlier this year and began con-
tacting classmates. Fray McCor-
mick, president of the class of
1989, and senior Patience Jones
have helped Salerno.

All seniors received a_ letter
several weeks ago telling them
about the time capsule and asking
for suggestions and donations.
Salemo, McCormick and Jones
came up with a contact list of
classmates representing various
sports, majors, fraternities and ex-
tracurricular activities.

*‘We hope that everyone will
contact at least one of these peo-
ple with their ideas and dona-
tions,’” Salerno said.

Salemo said she hopes to
receive most items by May 24,
She said the capsule will be
closed the day of graduation, June
1, and won’t be opened until Spr-
ing Reunion in 2014.

Finale:

Sbar speaks out
By Jon Sbar

 

 

Because of important scientific
discoveries made by people with
post-graduate degrees, electron mi-
croscopes and white laboratory
coats, I must postpone my planned
article on Canine Movie Stars to
discuss humpback whales. Before
I get to the humpbacks I feel obli-
gated to reassure those readers
who might doubt my academic
abilities by discussing my impres-
sive scientific background. Along
with a rigorous junior high class
on the metric system, I grew up
in a home with a very abnormal
father. For readers who are think-
ing, "Big deal, my father’s abnor-
mal too, but that doesn’t make me
a rocket scientist," here’s a
dramatic re-creation which will
serve to give you a little taste of
what my early youth was like.

Setting: A cold October
evening in the Sbar living room. I
turn on the TV and begin watch-
ing the Happy Days episode in
which The Fonz tries to jump a
bus with his motorcycle.

Important action: My Dad, us-
ing the remote control, changes
the station to channel 3, (the pub-
lic television station).

that a decision to hold a second
election rather than allow Dumas
to take office by succesion could
lead to charges of racism from
outside observers, but de Movellan
was quick to note that no racist
overtones had emanated from any
of the discussions thus far and
suggested that race was not a
factor under consideration.

Senior Greg Dale provided a
reason why he believed fall
elections were also out of the
question. Dale argued that
members of the 1989-90 EC will
not be bound by a decision made
by members of the 1988-89 EC in
favor of fall elections.

Finally, Nave suggested that the
Board of Trustees will view a
special election as mismanagement
of student government poewers.

Arguments against a special
election bolstered calls _ for
succession. Countering the
argument that students did not
realize that a _ vice-presidential
candidate could succeed to the
presidency, Falk said that ‘‘It’s
implicit and explicit in this
country’’ that a vice-president will
succeed a president if the
president is unable to fulfili the
duties of his term in office.

Furthermore, a number of EC
members and students who
participated in\_the discussion said
that Dumas definitely has the
ability and experience needed to
be an effective president. Dumas,
a rising junior, has served as an
EC class repre-sentative during
both his freshman and sophomore
years,

more popular bands in order to
encourage a better turn-out. He
said he would also like to have a
few outdoor concerts on the Col-
onnade with free admission, but is
not sure if the S.A.B. can afford
it.

“This year we (the S.A.B.)
really took it on the chin, espec-
ially at the end, °’ he said.
‘We're in the red now.”’

Applebaum said he would also
like to have two bingo nights next
year, one in the winter and one in
the spring.

‘Last year’s Bingo Night was
a huge success, hopefully it will
carry over to next year, ’’ he said.

on whales

Important dialogue:

Dad: ‘‘Sorry son but I can’t
let you miss this great special on
the breeding habits of the African
Horny Toad.”’

Me: “‘Gee Dad that sounds in-
teresting, but I’m feeling this sud-
den attack of diarrhea coming on.
I better go upstairs.”

Dad: ‘“‘Ivll have to wait until
this program’s over.”’

Me _ (becoming desparate):
“You know Dad, I have to do a
science project for school and I’ve
been thinking about carbon dating
your Aqua Velva Cologne. I better
get started right away.”’

Dad: ‘‘Great idea son, we'll do
it together as soon as _ this
program’s over.”’

Now that I’ve assured readers
who may have doubted by scien-
tific abilities, I can get back to
humpback whales.

The interesting thing about
humpbacks is that, unlike most
people, they take time out from
their busy schedule of eating, mi-
grating and mating to sing long
harmonious songs about life. For
years scientists have assumed that
humpbacks only sing classical mu-
sic but thanks to a famous scien-
tist who analyzed over 500 whale
songs we now know that many
humpback song lyrics have a pro-
nounced rhyming structure. What
this means in scientific terms is
that there are humpback whale rap
singers. In the spirit of scientific
discovery I have asked a world re-
nowned humpback song translator
to send me a tape of a popular
humpback rap song. Here are a
few excerpts from a song the
whales call ‘‘The Whalebone
Rap’’:

Swam south for the winter and
rapped some rhymes on the way
until I settled into a_ nice
warm bay.
Drinking saltwater and chillin’
on a reef
I saw a big shark that had
Sharp teeth
During high tide I stay out late
cuz all the hot babes line up
to mate.
My name is Moby D. and I!
write my own rap
that book by Melville is whal-
er crap
When I get bored I walk on
land
And do some hiphoppin' with
a New York band
I've got barnacles on my back
but at least my Mom ain't on
crack

If you want your very own
tape of ‘‘Whale Bone Rap’’ please
call 1-800-MOBY-DICK, or send
$11.99 to my house. Call right
away, this offer is limited. If you
call right away, we will send you
a set of Ginsu knives and a Ronco
portable fishing rod, so don’t de-
lay.

Last year, he earned All-
America status six times. This
year, he earned A-A status five
times and added to that the
distinction of being national
champion in the 200-yard
backstroke. Next year, he will
captain the swim team.

Add one more feather to
the impressive cap of junior
swimmer/water polo player Da-
vid Olson. The Ring-tum Phi
has named Olson its Athlete-
of-the- Year.

Olson’s 1:53.14 time in the
200-backstroke made him
Washington and Lee’s second
swimming National Champion.
He also earned All-America
status in the 200 individual
medley, 100 back, 200 medley
relay and 400 medley relay.
In 1988, Olson also earned
All-America status in those
events.

Olson described the feeling
he got after winning the title in
the 200-backstroke after finish-
ing a close second in 1988.
“I was frustrated after last
year, just missing the title. I
didn’t want to deal with that
frustration again. After I won,
it took a while for it to hit me,
and the more I thought about
it, I got more and more psy-
ched about winning the race.
It took awhile to actually real-
ize what had happened.”’

Olson is not one who will
spend a lot of time talking
about himself or his accomp-
lishments. Said W&L head
swimming coach Page Remil-
lard, ‘“‘David is the kind of

 

Olson ‘leads by example’

person who is quick to point
out the accomplishments of
other athletes, and he probably
tends to downplay his accom-
plishments more than his coach
does and his teammates do.”

Olson will be vocal when it
comes to leading the swim
team. Said freshman Jodi Her-
ring, “He gets everybody tog-
ether. | When people aren’t
standing up cheering on a
teammate, he is usually the
one who gets them up
cheering.”

Said senior David Dietz,
“‘He’s not an overbearing per-
sonality, but the confidence he
has rubs off on everyone else.
He just leads by example.

“‘He’s so successful because
he is so talented. For a team
to be good, they must have
that one talented person who
can come through when every-
thing is on the line. For us,
David Olson is that person.
We can always count on him
to win for us in the backstroke
and in the medley and get us
off to a good start in the rel-
ays. [His winning] is almost
automatic because he is so tal-
ented.”’

Olson has gotten a lot of
support from his family, and
according to senior Jeff Ber-
caw, it’s noticeable in his per-
formance. ‘‘Whatever he says
he’s going to do, he’ll do his
best to accomplish those
things. I think he gets that
from his parents, who are al-
ways there to support him.”’

Said Olson, ‘‘My parents
try to make every meet they
can. I tend to swim better
when I know they are their
watching me.”’

The Ring-tum Phi, May 18, 1989

 

 

David Olson

A junior from Fairfax Sta-
tion, VA, Olson spends the
majority of his academic time
in the C-School, majoring in
business administration and ac-
counting. His time in the C-
School has been very
productive, as Olson is a
Dean’s List student.

Said Remillard, ‘‘Dave sub-
scribes to the ‘if you’re going
to do it, do it the best you can
and so it right’ attitude, not
only in the pool, but in the
classroom as well. He’s an
excellent student.”’

Olson has not given serious
consideration to what he will
do after. he graduates. ‘I
don’t have any real goals set
right now. Hopefully I'll get a
job that I like and I'll take
things from there.”’

Congratulations to David
Olson, NCAA champion in the
200-backstroke and The Ring-
tum Phi Athlete-of-the-Year.

Said Remillard, ‘“‘If David
Olson is your friend, then you
have a very, very good friend.

 

 

Hathorn is two-of-a-kind

 

By Jay Plotkin
Assistant Sports Editor

 

Last season, Janine Hathorn
took charge of a women’s la-
crosse team in its first year of
existence. Playing only exhibi-
tion games, the team finished
4-7.

This season, in its first sea-
son of NCAA play, Hathorn
guided her team to a 7-8 rec-
ord, a third-place finish in the
Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
ence regular season standings
and semifinal finish in the
ODAC tournament.

In the fall, Hathorn turned
the women’s soccer team into
contenders in just their second
varsity season. She was
named ODAC Women’s Soccer
Coach-of-the- Year.

For her efforts, Hathorn has
been selected as The Ring-tum

Phi  Coach-of-the-Year for
1988-89.

Although Hathorn took
guidance of two fledgling

programs at W&L, she proved
at Denison University that she
had the coaching prowess to
make winners out of her
teams. In the five years she
spent at Denison, her record in
lacrosse was 53-19, including
five North Coast Athletic Con-
ference championship teams.
Hathom arrived at W&L
after applying for what is now
Cinda Rankin’s job. ‘‘I kept
in touch with Coach McHenry,
actually, he kept in touch with
me. When he was given the
okay to hire a women’s coach
for soccer, lacrosse or some-
thing, he got in touch with me

and asked if I was interested.
It was something that I had in
the back of my mind for a
couple of years before this ev-
er took place, and I left be-
cause I was interested in start-
ing a program from the ground
level, and see what I could do
with that.”’

At W&L, she has turned
two beginning programs into
contenders for conference titles
in just their first and second
seasons of NCAA play. She
Says there is no secret to the
instant success of her teams.
“IT would contribute it to the
fact that I really work hard in
trying to get people to enjoy
what they are doing and enjoy
hard work, which is hard work.

I guess it’s worked because of
the mix of students I’ve had
and knowing the kind of wom-
an I’m going to coach and
knowing how to deal with that
woman and what it takes to
get that person to recognize
and achieve things in them-
selves. This is a potential situ-
ation, where as I work on what
each person’s potential is. I
try to reinforce as much of the
positive as I could. It takes a
lot of hard work and very
willing students, and so far,
I’ve had all those ingredients.”’

One beneficiary of Hat-
horn’s coaching ability was la-
crosse goalie Erica Ingersoll,
who made 144 saves in the
last 10 games. Said Hathorn,
“She was continuing on in a
rut that I knew she could get
out of, and I just said things to
her that I thought she needed
to hear, and try to alleviate
pressure.”’

eel ets

Her greatest moment in
coaching came while she was
still at Denison. In her last
season, her lacrosse team went
10-1 before losing in the first
round of the NCAA tour- 4
nament. ‘‘As far as an exhil-
arating and cloud nine feeling,
it was the last season I coach-
ed lacrosse at Denison. We
were undefeated through the
regular season. Every player
on that team was a player that
I had coached every year they
had been there. We had a
very good team and we had a
blast playing together. We set
out to be undefeated and we
accomplished that. Something
about that season, maybe be-
cause I knew in the back of
my mind that it would be my
last one there, that really
stands out. Something about
the students, especially the
girls on the team.”’

Congratulations to Jan Hat- ,

Coach-of-the-Year for 1988-89.

 

 

Tennis nets fifth-place finish in

 

By Stu Sheldon
Staff Reporter

 

A little bit of misfortune hurt
the Washington and Lee men’s
tennis team at the Division III Na-
tional Tennis Championships in
Kalamazoo, Mich.

Team competition began on
Monday. Going in to the week-
long tournament W&L’s netters,
who are the defending national
champs, were seeded fifth.
According to the structure of the
tournament, the top four seeded
teams would play the second four
in a random order. The first
round pairings were determined by
a lottery, which was held on the
morning of opening day.

The Generals felt good about
facing three of their four potential
first-round opponents: Washington
College, UC-Santa Cruz, and Kal-
amazoo. The one team that could
give them fits was Swarthmore.
Guess who W&L faced in opening
round action.

Swarthmore had beaten W&L
6-3 earlier in the year, and the
Little Quakers’ depth was to be a
stumbling block again for the
Generals, who lost 5-3. The score
might have been the same. this
time, if the No. 2 doubles match
hadn’t been stopped due to a
mathematical win for the Little
Quakers.

The match did have several
bright spots for the Blue & White,
however. At No. 1 singles, junior
co-captain John Morris defeated
Andy Mouer, who was_ ranked
15th in the nation, Mouer and
Morris have always been involved
in heated competition, but this win
was just a little lop-sided.

Morris schooled Mouer in the
first set, winning 6-1. Morris
needed 20 tie-break points to
squelch Mouer in the second,
locking up the straight-set win 7-6
(11-9).

W&L’s second big gun, senior
co-captain Bobby Matthews, also
won his match in straight sets.
Matthews whipped 18th-ranked
Steve Tignor 6-4, 6-2.

The consistent play of the
these two players has been the
cornerstone of the Generals’ attack
during the 1988-89 season. Un-
fortunately, Swarthmore proved
overwhelming at the lower num-
bers.

Senior Robert Haley, playing at
No. 3, lost to the Little Quakers’
Lindsay Williams. After losing a
close first set, Williams rallied to
tie the match at two each, and
then pulled out the win, 5-7, 6-2,
6-3.

W&L sophomore Bill Meadows
quickly fell to Swarthmore’s
Cantine. The Little Quaker’s No.
4 man locked up the match, 6-4,

6-4. Freshman Reid Manley
dropped the No. 5 match in
Straight sets as well.

Swarthmore’s Dailey swept him 6-
2, 62. W&L junior netter Billy
Tunner held out for three sets
against Lee Tucker, but finally fell
6-3, 4-6, 4-6.

The Generals seemed very
much alive after singles, down 4-
2. A sweep of the doubles, like
they did last year against UC-SC
for the title, would mean a berth
in the semifinals. The problem
was evident, however: W&L’s
depth was not there.

The always stellar No. 1 pair
of Morris and Matthews did its
job, defeating Mouer and his
sophomore partner Jim Stahley, 6-
2, 6-4. The No. 3 pairings, pit-
ting W&L’s Malye and Tunner
against Swarthmore’s Cantine and
Tucker combo, was also handled
in straight sets, but by the Little
Quakers. Cantine and Tucker
clinched the first round win for
Swarthmore 6-2, 7-5.

With their 6-3 win over the
rookie Sagehens, the Generals ad-
vanced to face UC - San Diego
on Wednesday. If the Blue &
White were to win against the Tri-
tons, it would be their fourth top-
five finish at the tournament.

W&L jumped out to a quick 4-

three straight-set wins. Morris

Billy Tunner stopped W&L’s slide
and brought the Generals within

Haley and Meadows needed 10

ionship.”’
McHenry is not saying W&L
teams should take on 4a

win-at-all-costs mentality. Instead,
he would be satisfied as long as
each program is doing its best to
provide, what he calls, ‘‘an oppor-
tunity for success.”

‘I’ve always believed that it’s
important for our athletes to have
that opportunity. You certainly
have to have a reasonable chance
for achieving success in a particu-
lar sport. I’m not for having an
athletic program just to have an
athletic program.”’

But success or the opportunity
for success is sometimes difficult
to obtain and sustain at schools
such as W&L, where recruiting,
which many coaches proclaim to

» be the key to a winning program,
is hindered by the academic stan-
dards that must be met before a
student-athlete is granted admis-
sion. Therefore, when a athletic
“team fails, sometimes the blame
falls upon the admissions depart-
* ment.
. “The fact of the matter is,
with 3,300 people vying for 400
* places, we’re really in a luxurious
position of being able to select
people who are both gifted intel-
" lectually and capable of doing oth-
er things extremely well also,”
says William Hartog, director of
, W&L’s admissions department.
‘Tl think that’s the general goal.
* But the one variable that they all
, Must possess is a strong academic
record.”
Hartog uses the analogy of a
,, baseball fan going to a ballgame
to describe the admissions process.
An applicant’s academic record is
, that person’s ticket into the ball-
" park (consideration for accept-
’ ance), but it’s the person’s special
. qualities or talents that helps him
find a seat (acceptance). ‘‘If you
‘don’t have an academic record
strong enough to get yourself into
_ the ballpark, then there is no spe-
‘cial talent that will cause the
admissions committee to accept
_ you.”
"What gets one into the ball-
¥park? According to Hartog, a rule
gof thumb is that the student must
“place at or above the average of
#the bottom quintile (20 percent) of
gall the students being offered ad-

~

>

“mission: ~An~example would ~be~

"this fall’s incoming class. The
@average student scored about 610
40" the verbal and about 660 on
the math portions of the SATs and
éwas in the top 10 percent of his
class, says Hartog. The average
for the bottom quintile of this
“class would be approximately 530
gverbal, 590 math and top 18 per-
cent, according to Hartog.

* “So a recruited athlete’s aca-
‘demic record must be as strong as
_that bottom quintile, or we cannot
“consider him,’’ Hartog says.

University President John Wil-
son says he understands the im-

“portance of athletics at W&L, but
the is also not one who thinks the

hool should lower its standards
or athletes.

® ‘‘There’s no question that ath-
jletic participation is of wide cam-
~ interest,’ Wilson says. ‘“‘It
joes develop the morale of the
student body, and the students do
et interested and excited about a
uccessful team. That does consti-
gute a contribution to the universi-
ty. :
* “However, I think it would be
@ very bad mistake to start admit-
ns athletes who were below the
ccept level. The athlete should
pe in that accept group -- he can-
not be below it. In many of our
Sister institutions, the athlete is
Selow the accept group. He’s an
exception of some special kind.”’

A question still remains: Can
an athletic team be successful in
such an academic environment?
McHenry says yes.

‘Coaches have to compete hard
or student-athletes who are com-
etitive admissions-wise. It’s im-
‘ortant that [the athletic depart-
aent] work closely with admis-

ions and try —te attract
student-athletes who are qualified
nd can meet the admission stan-
lards and hopefully will be admit-
ed,’

“IT think you can, too,’’ says
Bob Clements, a 1980 graduate of
W&L and member of the last
N&L lacrosse team to eam an
invitation to the NCAA Division |
Championship Tournament.
Clements, who was named a first-

team All-America goalie after that
1980 season, heads the Baltimore
Ghapter of the Alumni Associa-
tion, one of the more active
groups when it comes to following
WA&L lacrosse.

» ylons department some credit,’’ he

be successful in — be it football
or lacrosse — is a bonus in my
opinion.

“I think [the alumni] in Balti-
more and everyone who has
played lacrosse for W&L and fol-
lows the team is somewhat disap-
pointed by the past two seasons.
One just hopes it gets better.’’

According to Wilson, W&L
alumni are ‘‘very outspoken about
all aspects of the university.”’
However, lacrosse’s status as one
of W&L’s ‘biggest traditions, one
of its mainstays’? — as Clements
describes it — has definitely been
an issue that several alums have
spoken up about. And the one
person who has come under fire is
head coach Dennis Daly.

“‘No question about it,’’ an-
swers Clements, Daly is under
pressure from the Baltimore alum-
ni. ““They are going to look at the
coach. It’s the nature of the busi-
ness. Regardless if [Daly is] right
or wrong in his coaching de-
cisions, he’s going to take some
heat.’’ ee hey oe be

“T don’t think the alumni are
well-informed as to the problems
that currently exist with our eff-
orts to be successful,’’ says
McHenry. ‘“‘I think it is [an over-
reaction], yes.”’

“I don’t think their frustration
is an overreaction, just where
they’re directing their criticism,”
says John Ware, a _ senior
co-captain of this season’s lacrosse
team. Ware, an attackman who
has been one of the cornerstones
of the Generals’ offense the past
three years, puts the blame back
on the admissions department.

“The problem, as far as I can
see, is the admissions policy,’’ he
says. ‘‘I don’t think [the alumni}
are being fair to coach Daly.”’

“The flag is up,’’ says Daly.
“‘People are looking. I think that
that is fine — to look — and I
think that people should look.’’

“W&L is definitely going to
honor the next two years of Den-
nis Daly’s contract which is until
1991,’’ he says, ‘‘but it’s still un-
decided whether Dennis Daly’s
responsibilities will be of head
lacrosse coach. That’s undecided.
That’s still under review.”’

* * k *

It has been an up and down six
seasons for Dennis Daly. After
taking over a program in 1984
that was Division I in name only,
Daly’s teams suffered through
three straight losing seasons before
the decision was made to change
to Division III. Then came the
Final Four finish in 1987 — and
with it high expectations — and
then the two sub-par seasons.

Daly has analyzed his team’s
difficulties, and he sees the prob-
lem as twofold. One is a lack of
communication while the other is

a lack of consistency.

The communication gap stems,
according to Daly, from a state-
ment made by W&L’s Athletic
Committee in its recommendation
for lacrosse to drop from Division
I to Division Ill. Says Daly,
“The committee said that ‘the
switch from Division I to Division
III status should be coming by a
commitment to excellence with a
goal of winning a championship.
The committee recommends that
the administration voices commit-
ment publicly and increases sup-
port, especially in recruitment ef-
forts on behalf of lacrosse.’

“I, as head coach, am not
aware of any public statement fol-
lowing that recommendation to
publicly commit administration
support for lacrosse to go for the
national championship.

“The problem is someone has
got to come out and define what
the goal is, and I don’t think
that’s been done,”’ he says. ‘‘No
one is really certain — or it hasn’t
been stated publicly — where we
want specifically the lacrosse pro-
gram to go. The public commit-
ment has not been made. We’re
still arguing what level of success
we want to be versus how we’re
going to get there. There are so
many variables that aren’t de-
fined.”

Daly thinks the first step
should be for the president, athlet-
ic director, director of admissions,
an alumnus and the coach to sit
down and discuss the specific
goals of the lacrosse program and
the exact course of action neces-
sary to realize those goals.

“Let’s get a meeting of every-
body and decide what we are go-
ing to do,’’ he says. ‘“‘The best
we can be is the best in Division
III, but no one has really sat
down and said, ‘Okay, but what is
it going to take?’”’

Ware agrees. ‘‘I don’t think
{university officials] have sat
down and decided where they
want their athletic teams to go.”

As for the consistency, or lack
thereof, Daly attributes this prob-
lem to coeducation, constantly ris-
ing admissions standards and a
frequently changing coaching staff.

Coeducation has resulted in a
drop in male enrollment, while
academic requirements have risen
due to a marked increase in appli-
cations. Daly, who became head
lacrosse coach at Amherst during
the school’s third year of coeduca-

tion, sees parallels between
W&L’s athletic dilemma and
Ambherst’s.

According to Daly, the male
athletic talent ‘‘bottomed out’’ the
year he arrived in Amberst yet
rebounded after the coeducation
situation was totally settled and

RESTAURANT

 

the climbing standards had leveled
off. He predicts the same phen-
omenon will occur here at W&L.

“I know people are getting im-
patient, but I see the program
Starting to stabilize itself right
now. I think what it’s going to
do in the next three or four years
is more indicative of what the fu-
ture holds then what’s happened
the last couple of years. I think it
has been a result of the adjust-
ment to coeducation. I’m speak-
ing from experience of what hap-
pens to a large-team sport.”’

Does this mean that W&L can
once again compete for a lacrosse
national championship? Ironically,
it seems that a _ Division III
school’s admissions department,
which mainly concentrates on aca-
demic matters, can also provide a
path for athletic success.

“‘T think there’s more hypocrisy
in Division If] than in Division
I,’ says Hartog, who personally
reviews each student-athlete’s tran-
script if he is being actively rec-
ruited by one of the programs.
“Like it or not, Division I at least
has an admissions policy concern-
ing athletes. Some Division III

schools profess to be academic
institutions and yet make except-
ions,”’

Daly agrees. ‘“‘It’s not even
close,’’ he says. ‘‘Most of the
schools have lower standards than
ours to begin with, but then they
will make exaggerated exceptions
for their athletes in specific sports.
It’s out there and it’s happening
all the time.”’

In light of these transgressions,
Hartog views a national title as
out of W&L’s grasp.

“IT don’t believe that it’s im-
possible for us to be competitive
in lacrosse and to be among the
top ten or twelve schools in la-
crosse,’’ he says. ‘‘But I do think
that it will be virtually impossible
for us to win a national champion-
ship in lacrosse.”

“T don’t think it’s impossible
for us to be national champions,”’
says Daly, ‘‘but I don’t think it’s
possible for us to consistently win
a national championship. I think
it’s possible for us to consistently
be in the tournament.’’

Ware takes a slightly different
stance. “‘If you play in the NBA,
you want to win the champ-
ionship. If you play football, you
want to win the Super Bowl. If
you play W&L lacrosse, you want
to play for a national champion-
ship. Under [the admissions de-
partment’s} philosophy and_ their
idea of success, I don’t think you
can,”

Says Clements, “‘If the school
wants tO maintain some lacrosse
stability - somewhere, somehow,
something has got to change.”’

The Ring-tum Phi, May 18, 1989

IMIKE SHADY]
Time for a
new tradition

What I’m about to say will shock you. Webster’s has
been lying to you.

The word ‘‘change”’ is not the word it appears to be. It
has too many letters. It should really only be a four-letter
word. At least that’s the way people have been treating this
noun/verb that always seems to indicate impending doom.

Let’s set the record straight:

Change does not mean W&L will be taken over by femi-
nists,

Change does not mean Coach Lord will ever stop sweating.

 

And change does not mean the end of tradition.

Ah, you say. So that’s what he wants to talk about --
tradition. Tradition is one of those words that the mere
mention of it somehow magically transports you back to the
.... Good Old Days.

W&L lacrosse has a tradition, and a good one at that. It
all began in the late 1960s and continued on through the
‘glory years’’ (another one of those phrases that makes you
catch your breath) of the 70s and early 80s with that diety of
lacrosse coaches, Jack Emmer.

Tradition is fine -- until it runs into change.

One change was not W&L’s fault. It seemed the little
game became a might to popular and then somebody thunk up
the great idea that you could make money off it and then
WHAMMO! Division I with scholarships and shoe contracts
and welcome to the big time W&L, sorry we didn’t ask y’all
if you really wanted to come before we invited you.

So the Division I tradition had to end. Change 1, Tradi-
tion 0

With the switch to Division II], a new winning tradition
was just beginning and this was so much nicer because we
were all competing under the same and wonderful ideal of
student-athlete, with the heavy emphasis placed on student.
But this tradition, too, had to perish. Instead of playing by
the unwritten rules, schools were stretching and reaching for
the best lacrosse players available, with the D-III philosophy
and academics firmly entrenched in an afterthought.

Meanwhile, back on the farm, coeducation was draining the
male athletic pool by reducing male enrollment, increasing the
academic standards and thus, making recruiting for the W&L
men’s team similar to climbing Mt. Everest with an ice pick
or trying to make sense of the Spectator -- you could try but
you wouldn’t get very far. Change 2, Tradition 0

So what do we do now? Is it possible to be athletically
competitive even on the Division III level? Can we have a
somewhat ‘‘cosmic’’ mesh between athletics and academics?
Or for one to be successful, does the other have to suffer or
make a compromise?

You can see a lot of things happen in four years. I have
witnessed a tennis national championship, a near-playoff
football team, a semifinalist in lacrosse, a national qualifying
golf team, the birth and subsequent rise of women’s athletic
teams and the amazing excitement created by the arrival of
the “Temple of Doom.’’(with a dancing SID at your service,
ladies).

The question before us is one that can never be fully
answered, Can W&L athletics succeed and sustain success
with the present academic policy in place in the admissions
department? The pair of eyes which have taken in my last
four years here say ‘‘yes’’. Instead of wishing for days long
since past, I challenge the you, the students and the student-
athletes at this university, to start yet another tradition: One
in which W&L maintains its academic integrity while also its
athletic effectiveness. That’s a tradition that even change
can’t touch.

Lenfest Center scheduled — Jan ‘91

 

By Cecily Tynan
Staff Reporter

 

“In its planning, the Lenfest
Center has evolved from being a
teaching theater to a_ performing
arts center,’’ Department Head and
Professor of Fine Arts, Albert C.
Gordon said Friday during a
Washington and Lee University
alumni reunion program _ titled
“The Hot Topics on Campus.”’

The center, which is currently
under construction at a site located
diagonally across Nelson Street
from the university's Gaines Resi-
dence Hall, will house two
theaters in addition to several oth-
er facilities.

The main theater will seat 425
and is designed to accommodate
dramatic, musical and dance per-
formances.

‘““We wanted the theater to be
fairly intimate. We designed it to
be a performing arts facility, not a
convention center, ** said Gordon.

The floor of the stage will be
equipped with a trap door, lift and
an orchestra pit, he said.

The center will also house a
separate experimental black box
theater. Flexible lighting from an
overhead grid, removable seating
and an adjustable corridor will
give the theater the potential to be
configured in various ways for
different productions, said Gordon.

The main lobby will provide
space for receptions and displays
of the art collections. The top lev-
el of the center will have faculty
offices and catwalks above the
two theateis. Other facilities _in-
clude a scene shop, cosiume shop,
dressing rooms and a_ rehearsal

Little Shop called ‘spectacular’

 

By Joei Dyes
Staff Reporter

Little Shop of Horrors is spec-
tacular!

From the moment the lights
dimmed at 8:00 p.m. on Saturday
night in the Henry Street Play-
house until the grand finale, the
all-student cast of W&L’s produc-
tion of Little Shop had its audi-
ence on the edge of their seats.

The story begins finding the
elderly Mr. Mushnik (played by
junior Todd Peppers) in distress as
he has to tell his employees, Sey-
mour (senior Mike Carroll) and
Audrey (senior Monica Burke),
that he must close his flower shop
due to lack of business. Yet, when
Seymour puts one of his plants
(the Audrey II, named for his fel-

 

 

low employee and secret crush) in
the window of the shop, Mush-
nik’s business increases rapidly.
Unfortunately, Seymour is soon
faced with the dilemma of how to
feed the plant, after realizing it
requires blood to survive when he
accidentally pricks his finger on a
thorn and the plant snaps greedily
at the wound.

The Audrey II (operated by
freshman Willie Henderson) grows
to fill the littlke shop when Sey-
mour opts for a creative alterna-
tive in dealing with Audrey’s vio-
lent boyfriend, Orvin Scrivello (pl-
ayed by sophomore Scott Bell).
After that, the cannibalistic mon-
ster-plant becomes a haunting real-
ity, and demands that Seymour
choose between his moral stand-
ards or fame and wealth. Seymour

The musical has a score filled
with upbeat “SOs and ’60s music.

great excitement to the musical.

First-year Law Student Amy

Nancy Hickam, and _ freshmen
Ryan Kull, Kristen Ramberg and
Andrew Keller all have supporting
roles in the production.

Albert C. Gordon, head of the
W&L fine arts department and
director of the show, said that the
musical is the most technically

at W&L. Senior Drew W. Platt
has spent the entire year working
on designs for the carnivorous Au-

hard work and dedication of those
who took part in the production
shines through in every scene.

The Bookery

 

By Caly Smith
Staff Reporter

 

A new bookstore selling, buy-
ing and trading used hardback and
paperback books has opened its
doors at 107 W. Nelson St. in
Lexington.

““We feel that Lexington has
been very supportive. A lot of
other businesses in town have
sent us flowers, balloons and cards
to wish us success in our busi-
ness,’’ said Jeannette Baggs who
opened the store called ‘‘The
Bookery’’ with her husband Gary.
The store policy posted in the
store states The Bookery’s policy
on selling, trading and buying
books. Used paperbacks are sold
at half of the publisher’s price.
Hardback books are priced indi-
vidually and 50 percent of a sale
can be used as traded credits.

““We are encouraging people
to trade not sell, ’’ Mrs. Baggs
sid.

The Bookery trades paperbacks
at one-fourth the original price,
and hardbacks at half the
Bookery’s retail. ‘‘Anyone can
trade books two for one. If you
bring in two books, I’ll give you
one. We trade fiction for fiction,
l'amour for l'amour, romance for

According to the policy, Tht

paperbacks at one-eighth of thy
publishers price and hardbacks at
one-fourth of the Bookery’s retaz%
price. Personal libraries and co!-
lector’s items are negotiable ac:
cording to the store policy.

Mrs. Baggs said she and hey
husband have been collecting
books for 16 years. ‘

“Every state we've crossed,
we've bought books. When the
attic space became cramped I de
cided to turn a hobby into a voce,

that,’ she said. The Baggs
moved to Lexington in January,
from Tuscan, Arizonia. Mrs.
Baggs said she grew up in the
Richmond/Petersburg area and al:
ways wanted to return to the
Shenandoah Valley. ‘

““We scouted out Lexington ~

From Staff Reports

Construction on W&L’s new
home for the performing arts, the
Lenfest Center, is continuing on
schedule, with the completion date
set for September 1990.
Construction of the $9.8 million
project begafi last summer after
the university received a major
gift of $3 million from Marguerite
and H.F. (Gerry) Lenfest of
Huntingdon Valley, Pa. Lenfest is
a 1954 W&L graduate.

As work at the site progresses,
the university is offering area
residents and fine arts patrons the
opportunity to join in the
celebration of its commitment to
the arts by ‘‘naming a seat’’ in
the main theatre of the new
center. The main theatre will seat

In addition to the $9.89 million
construction expenses, the W&L
Board of Trustees is seeking to
create a $2 million endowment to

ensure the highest quality arts

Ronn William Mercer, the

the university’s Reeves Center, has
been given a six-month suspended

probation.

program for the university and the
community. Approximately $11.2
million of the $11.8 million goal
has been met thus far. As
university officials near the
completion of their campaign, they
are asking alumni and friends of
W&L, as well as local patrons of
the arts, to help bridge the final
gap.

With a gift of $2,500, a donor
can bestow his or her name and
financial

support, or use the
Opportunity to honor someone
else, as well as support the

construction and endowment of the
facility. Every name seat will be
identified with a plaque, mounted
on its back, bearing the name of
the donor or someone whom the
donor wishes to honor.

The new Lenfest Center will
allow the university to realize its
full potential in teaching and
producing the performing arts.
The variety of visiting
performances will be expanded to
include full symphonies, large

of grand larceny when he first ap-

(During that brief appearance,
Honts asked Mercer, ‘‘How do

asked Mercer if he was entering a
guilty plea because he was in fact
guilty, Mercer answered, ‘‘Yes,

But Mercer’s attorney, Marshall
Mundy of Roanoke, then asked
Honts to accept the plea under
advisement until a pre-sentence re-
port could be completed. Honts

the performing arts continues as scheduled. The center’s
projected opening time is September 1990.

‘New performing arts center builds on

dance troupes, and traveling
theatre companies of national rank.
The new center will provide the
university, and the entire
Lexington and Rockbridge County
community, with an outstanding
facility that will enrich the cultural
life of the whole area.

Albert C. Gordon, head of the
W&L fine arts department, says
the Lenfest Center will a great
asset to the community. “The
building is going to be available
for community use, especially by
FAIR (Fine Arts in Rockbridge),
The Rockbridge Concert-Theatre
Series, and other local groups,”’
says Gordon.

““A number of local residents
have expressed their desire to
contribute to the Lenfest Center.
*Naming a seat’ in the theatre
provides the opportunity for local
people to contribute to the
building and be recognized for
their support,’’ Gordon said. He
also added that a number of
parents of current W&L students

have “‘named a seat’’ for their
children.

A committee is planning a gala
weekend celebration in January
1991, after the center opens the
preceding fall. Included in the
plans are a dinner recognizing all
donors and a series of events
featuring W&L groups and guest
artists,

Frank Parsons, director of
capital projects at the university,
says construction of the Lenfest
Center is going well. ‘‘We are
now in the process of bringing
utility lines toward the site, down
Washington Street between the
Warner Center and Gaines Hall,’’
Parsons said.

“This summer,’’ he added,
“the lines will have to cross
Route 60 (Nelson Street). We are

doing everything we can to
prepare for the phase of
construction, creating as little

inconvenience as we can in the
shortest amount of time as
possible.”’

Results from Washington
and Lee University’s winter
term reveal that women have
again attained a higher overall
grade point average (GPA)
than men.

As spring term begain this
week, the line at the registrar’s
office grew as students waited
to receive last semester’s
grades. A sheet tabulating re-
sults for all students and social
organizations, posted by Uni-
versity Registrar Scott Dittman,
showed females earned higher
marks.

This is the first grading pe-
riod that ranks the new sorori-
ties that were established this
past winter. Leading the pack
was Kappa Kappa Gamma
with a 3.08 cumulative GPA.
Both Chi Omega and Kappa
Alpha Theta recorded GPAs
above. = 29: Independent
women carried a 3.05 GPA.

Asked if this proved W&L
women to be smarter, Junior
Steven Gomez said, "I don’t

 

 

Women top men
academically last term

think it proves that women are
smarter, I just think in general
that the girls here expend more
effort than the men."

Whether this is true remains
to be seen, but the men’s sta-
tistics certainly do not show
the consistency of the females’.
There is a .331 point spread in
the men’s grades as compared
to a .018 point spread in the
women’s grades,

For the men, Lambda Chi
Alpha led the way for the sec-
ond consecutive semester with
a 2.992 cumulative GPA, while
Sigma Phi Epsilon followed up
the rcar with a 2.581. No
men’s organization, including
independent men, tallied a
GPA over the 3.0 mark.

Junior Scott Pierce thinks
the grades this past term reflect
this quality of the females en-
tering the university since co-
education began in 1986, "It
is well-known that the stand-
ards for females and the stan-
dards for males are quite dif-
ferent," he said. "Whether

they [the women] are smarter
or not | don’t know. They
just seem more diligent."

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA

APRIL 20, 1989

Search continues

 

By Elizabeth Parkins
Tri-Editor

Lexington police are _ still
searching for the hit-and-run driver
who killed W&L freshman Mary
Ashley Scarborough last month.

Police Chief Bruce Beard said
investigators have completed a
check on all blue cars registered
at nearby colleges. He said
Virginia Tech was the last to be
checked. He said they looked at
almost 100 blue cars. Beard said
investigators have not entirely
ruled out area schools and
continue to follow up on leads.

He said the investigators are
now using a printout of all
Hondas registered in a five county
area supplied by the Virginia
Division of Motor Vehicles.
Rockbridge, Augusta, Botetourt,
Rockingham and _ Roanoke
Counties are included, Beard said.

The Virginia State Police
investigator, called in to help the
Lexington Police investigation, has
finished a report that reconstructed
the hit and run. Beard said the
investigators are 100 percent
positive Scarborough was crossing
Washington Street toward Kappa

Alpha fraternity.

The police investigator
concluded that a car had been
traveling west on Washington
Street when it struck Scarborough
from the rear. The car then
swerved into the east-bound lane
and up a small hill. Police were
unable to get tire marks from the
grassy hill, Beard said.

In another development, Beard
said investigators found the blue
’87 Accord had been assembled in
a Merrysville, Ohio, plant.
According to Don Cobble, the
sales manager at the Honda
dealership in Staunton, American
Honda Corporation has only one

assembly plant in the United
States. Cobble said American
Honda’ keeps computerized

information of all shipments of its
cars throughout the U.S. He
added that they also keep records
of car sales for warranty purposes.
Cobble could not estimate how
many °87 Hondas were sold in the
U.S., but said that his dealership
dealt with roughly 200 cars.

Beard asks that anyone with
any type of information should
contact the police department at
463-2112.

Four fraternities named for the
renaissance renovation program

 

By Heidi Read
Tri-Editor

Four fraternities have been ac-
cepted into the Fraternity Renais-
sance renovation program, accord-
ing to Dean of Students Leroy C.
“Buddy”’ Atkins.

Atkins said the Fraternity Ren-
ovation Steering Committee, made
up of students and alumni, acce-
pted applications from Sigma Al-
pha Epsilon, Pi Kappa Alpha, Be-
ta Theta Pi and Sigma Nu. He
said the estimated cost of renova-
tion to those houses would be
$700,000 for SAE, $673,000 for
Pika, $759,000 for Beta and
$409,000 for Sigma Nu. The cost
of a new house would be about
$1 million.

Atkins said no other fraternities
except Phi Kappa Sigma had sub-
mitted applications to be consid-
ered for the renovation program.
He said their application had not
yet been considered by the com-
mittee.

Atkins said all the fraternity
renovation projects are ‘‘pretty
major and won’t be easy jobs.
{For example,}] SAE has some
structural problems.’’ None of the
fraternity houses have undergone

any major changes since they
were built in the 1920’s and 30’s.

Atkins said the renovation pro-
jects will not begin until about
March or April of next year and it
is not known how many houses
will be renovated at one time.

The restorations are part of a
$10 million program to renovate
W&L’s 17 fraternity houses.

The goal of the program is to
set uniform standards in all the
local chapters and strengthen the
fraternity system overall. The stan-
dards are mandatory and not op-
tional guidelines. All fraternities
must comply with the standards to
be eligible to participate in the
Fraternity Renaissance Program.

Under the program approved
by the board of trustees last Octo-
ber, the university will advance
financing for the renovation of the
17 fraternity houses, absorb cur-
rent mortgage balances and man-
age the renovations in return for
the title of the fraternity house.

Fraternities are not required to
participate in the renaissance fi-
nancing program, but they must
still comply with the university’s
“Standards for  Fraternities,”’
which also call for some physical
renovation of the fraternity houses.

OPINION
New blood

Critics of this year’s Phi, rejoice! The Publications
Board, the body that oversees W&L’s student publications,
has named the paper’s editors for 1989-90. Our
congratulations to rising seniors Stacy Morrison and Greg
Euston.

Is anybody out
there listening?

In recent weeks, The Phi has published MY VIEWS that
we considered somewhat controversial, to say the least.
Among other things, student writers have argued that
fraternities have the right racially to discriminate; that’
Louisiana legislator David Duke’s opponents aren’t as pure
as they’d have us believe; and that Salman Rushdie should
be condemned (though not to death). We thought such
essays would bring forth a flurry of rebuttals, yet our
mailbox remained pretty empty. If not for Tim
McMahon’s column on this page, we'd think W&L
students agreed with all the opinions we’ve published

While the afore-mentioned pieces were certainly well-
written and well-argued, we also thought they begged for a
response from someone, somewhere. If anyone out there
agrees, let us know. Your responses, comments and
criticisms, as letters or MY VIEWS, should be submitted
by noon on Tuesday to The Ring-tum Phi’s office in the
University Center or can be mailed to us at the address
given below. We’re looking forward to hearing from you.

The AP responds

To the Editors:

 

I have seen your March 23 editorial accusing our Richmond
bureau chief, Dennis Montgomery, of monkey business in his
coverage of the recent appearance of Donna Rice on your campus.

Your position seems to have been derived entirely from a letter
written by your respected Dr. Louis Hodges. There is another
view.

When the proceedings were placed off the record, Montgomery
left the room, an exercise in ethical behavior that was sure to avoid
the temptation to stay and then writhe with frustration on hearing
something that could not be shared with readers.

Then a distinguished member of your faculty saw Montgomery
outside and told him the proceedings were on the record.
Montgomery went back in. And he proceeded to commit some ”
journalism.

Whatever the problem here, it has nothing to do with a lapse of
Montgomery’s ethics. It had everything to do with a seminar that
couldn’t make up its mind about what it wanted to be.

While you're fretting about journalistic ethics, you might think
just a bit about launching an attack on someone’s ethics after
having heard only one side. :

I write without rancor toward your campus, which I’ve enjoyed
visiting, toward Dr. Hodges, whose work in journalism ethics has a
national reputation, or toward Miss Rice, with whom I have never
sailed or spoken.

Sincerely,

Louis D. Boccardi
President and General Manager

MY VIEW

The IRA:

MY VIEW
By Tim McMahon ’87

 

 

"An opinion infected by ignorance is
harmless until acted on, when it can become a
source of embarrassment or worse, when
confronted with one more firmly based in
fact." -- Charles Gay, "My View," The Ring-
tum Phi, March 16, 1989.

These words precede an opinion piece
denouncing an individual’s financial support of
the militant Irish Republican Army. That the
IRA participates in brutal killings (sometimes
resulting in the accidental deaths of
bystanders) is undeniable; however, since its
inception, any Irish nationalist violence has
been condemned by the Catholic Church in
Ireland, and even the Republic of Ireland
considers the IRA an outlaw organization.
Nonetheless, what is most disturbing about the
author’s denunciation is the equally undeniable
lack of factual basis for his statement that the
Protestants of Norther Ireland “are as Irish as
anyone else, having lived there for 350 years."
To work from this assumption is to deny 2000
years of Irish history.

First, one must attempt to define "Irish."
The chief misconception about Ireland is that
it is simply an extension of Great Britain.
Since the Celtic tribe known as the Gaels
arrived on the isle of Erin (circa 500 BC),
any foreign influence has been assimilated into
the native culture. In fact, until the nineteenth
century when famine caused mass
emigration and state schools made English a
required subject Gaelic language and
customs were elements of the longest
surviving, continually developing culture in
Western Europe.

Catholicism, whose Irish roots trace back
to the legendary St. Patrick, did not rule
Ireland in the same way the religion of a
traditional European monarchy determined the
religion of that monarchy’s subjects. Instead,
Catholicism became as much a part of the
daily existence of every Irish person as the
Gaelic language. With hindsight, the greatest
irony of today’s religious strife is the original
English claim to power over Ireland -- the
Laudbiliter of 1155, a paper bull (decree)
granting the English King Henry II lordship of

Irish loyalty to Rome.

Still, it wasn’t until the Reformation rocked
England that there was significant Irish
resistance to England. Irish leaders opposed
Tudor excesses and later those of the Long
Parliament. As a_ result, the | English
systematically attempted to destroy the Irish
will. Mercantilist laws forever linked the Irish
economy to the British market, and,
remembering virtually 100 percent of the
native Irish were Catholics, the British Penal
laws "outlawed" Catholicism.

The most successful tactic used to supplant
the Irish people, however, was plantation --
uprooting the local leaders and population and
"planting" loyal British subjects (who

happened to be devout Protestants). Plantation
reached its apex in Ulster where a particularly
large number of Scotch Presbyterians moved
to avoid’ English Anglican persecution. Only
in the nineteenth century, after England saw
fit to include Presbyterians in the power
structure of the North did the "Orange
Card" -- using religious difference to
encourage the status quo suppression of
Catholics -- become an effective element of
Ulster’s political union with Britain.

Since plantation, the Protestants of the
North have resisted assimilating most native
customs into their daily routine. § They
consider themselves British. Ulster Catholics,
meanwhile, feel closer to the Catholics of the
South rather than to their Protestant neighbors;
they see themselves as Irish. It is this
identity crisis of British versus Irish, and only
secondarily Protestant versus Catholic, which
is the chief cause of turmoil in the region.

In a militant fashion, the IRA attempts to
expel what it sees as an alien element from
home soil. At the same time, however,
Protestant organizations, such as the Royal
Ulster Constabulary and the Ulster Volunteer
Force, utilize equally violent measures against
Ulster Catholics. One seldom hears of RUC

What the IRA represents today is actually
a distillation of more than 800 years of

that during separate negotiations, Britaim’s

partition would be temporary, while he told
the Irish Unionists the partitions would be
permanent. Once separate deals were struck,
he opted for the permanent course. The

MY VIEW

By Jon Sbar

Every country in the world has
a national hobby. In France, for
example, the local inhabitants
spend their leisure time sitting
around cafes eating croissants (or
jelly doughnuts) and discussing
politics, philosophy and the Eiffel
Tower. The English keep busy
with tea breaks and the royal
family. And Americans, who are
more dignified than Europeans,
drink beer with their friends and
wait until the conversation turns to
the subject of sports.

Once on the subject of sports,
friends will argue against each
other for hours (sometimes weeks)
until one party concedes defeat
(usually after a fist fight). Not on-
ly are hypothetical sporting
debates good for mental health,
they also. insure American
prosperity,

As long as Bob and Ken (two
high school students) can spend
seven consecutive hours debating
the outcome of an imaginary box-
ing match between Muhammed
Ali in his prime and reigning
heavyweight champion Mike Ty-
son, America will remain a world
power. The fact that Shomoto
(Bob and Ken’s Japanese counter-
part) is learning vector calculus
while Bob and Ken do their long
division homework, humming mu-
sic television tunes means nothing.

As a patriotic American I felt
good about spending a recent

 

Sunday arguing sports and drink-
ing Budweiser with Dexter, my
best friend’s uncle’s once removed
cousin’s aborted fetus. On the sub-
ject of the world’s most difficult
sport, Dexter argued for triathlons
while I opted for airline travel.
What started out as a_ friendly
conversation soon turned into an
embroiling controversy. Since
Dexter is a leading astrophysicist,
I knew he would be impervious to
emotional expressions (especially
those involving violence). If I
tried to convince him by breaking

parent confidence, no one board-
ing an airplane really thinks the
plane will take-off and land safely.
This fact is true regardless of the
successful flights the traveler has
completed. In addition, the prob-
lem is compounded by newspaper
headlines like, ‘‘Commercial air-
plane engine falls out in midair:
screaming passengers disintegrate
during explosion.’’ Anyone with
the courage to board an airplane
has the potential to wrestle alliga-
tors, work for the CIA, or finish
reading this article.

 

Airline travel, invented sometime in the
19th century by the Wright brothers,
requires courage, dexterity, intelligence,
strength, patience and an airplane. There-
fore, anyone who participates in this elite
sport can be considered a great athlete.

“‘But your point is moot.”’

To defeat Dexter I needed hard
facts based on the scientific meth-
od. Here’s what I came up with:

Title: Why Airline Travel Is
The Greatest Sport Known To
Man

Preamble: Airline travel,
invented sometime in the 19th
century by the Wright brothers,
requires courage, dexterity, intel-
ligence, strength, patience and an
airplane. Therefore, anyone who
participates in this elite sport can
be considered a great athlete.

Data:

1. Courage: Regardless of ap-

2. Dexterity: The need for
passenger dexterity begins even
before boarding the plane. In order
for passengers (who by definition
are always late) to reach their
planes on ume they must run
through crowded airport corridors
avoiding abandoned luggage, jani-
tors, wheelchairs, motorized trans-
portation vehicles and Hari Krish-
na’s trying to give books away.
Once on the plane, passengers
wanting to visit the lavatory (air-
line lingo for bathroom) in order
to see the blue toilet water need
acrobatic skills to get by steward-
esses and their double decker food
and beverage carts.

with hopes of getting to his or her
destination had better have a good
strategy for the baggage belt. The
ability to jockey for position
around hostile passengers waiting
for lost luggage is no small feat,
4. Strength: Toting wieldy
suitcases through parking lots ahd
airports is great workout. In fact,
many great body builders started
out as world travelers. :
5. Patience: When a landed air-
plane finally comes to a complete
stop the antsy passengers stand up.
For some reason, no one knows
why, when an airplane finally gets
to the right gate ittakes hours
(sometimes days) for the people -in
front of you to get their jackets,
carry-on luggage and pet frogs’ out
of the overhead compartment. «A
mere mortal would go_ insane
waiting to deplane (airline — word
for getting off the airplane); wut
airline travelers are not mere mor-
tals, they are warrior-passengers.
6. An airplane: Without the yse
of psychedelic drugs an airplane is
definitely a prerequisite to airplane
travel. ‘
Conclusion: Make airplane trav-
el an olympic sport immediately,

research of airline travel (based on
the scientific method) was funded

MERCER

ceived that report around Feb. 22,
1989.)

Here is a summary of the
events that led to Mercer’s convic-
tion, based on the Sept. 6 indict-
ment and police reports:

Mercer stole 25 pieces of Chi-
nese export porcelain and eight
small carved ivory figurines from
the center on or about Aug. 4,
1988, the grand jury said. Mercer
worked there as an undergraduate
and during the summer after he
graduated, according to John
Elrod, who was serving as W&L’s
acting president when Mercer first
appeared in court.

Mercer then contacted Flying
Crane Antiques of New York
City, apparently in hopes of sell-
ing the items, according to
Lexington Police Lt. Stephen E.
Crowder.

“The guy at Flying Crane
Antiques said, ‘‘Let me get a hold
of a friend of mine to appraise
this,” according to Crowder. That
dealer then contacted another New
York City antiques dealer, who
recognized the items Mercer was
offering as part of the Reeves
Center’s collections, Crowder said.

That dealer then contacted
Reeves Center Director James
Whitehead, who confronted Mer-
cer, and Mercer then confessed,
said Crowder.

Kirkland told The Phi White-
head is in France this week, and
attempts .by The Phi to contact
him there were unsuccessful.
Commonwealth’s Attorney Eric
Lee Sisler could not be reached
for comment.

On Aug. 17, 1988, Mercer
wrote a_ three-page, handwritten
letter to Whitehead, Reeves Center
staff member James Kirkland and
university President John Wilson.
In that letter, a copy of which was
obtained by The Phi from the
Rockbridge County clerk of
court’s office, Mercer apologized
for what he called ‘“‘the shame I
have brought to Washington and
Lee.’’ He said he had never stolen
before in his life and still doesn’t
understand why he allowed him-
self ‘‘to take part in such an ac-
tion.”

“TI allowed myself to get
caught up in my own problems
and unfortunately fell prey to the
trap of an easy solution,’’ wrote
Mercer. ‘‘Now, however, rather
than solve my original problem |
have created for myself even more
serious problems.”’

Mercer said, ‘‘it was truly my
intention to replace the objects
involved once I was able and
hopefully be able to contribute to
the collection’s growth.”’

But Mercer said he is now
‘mortified by the consequences’’
of his actions and ‘‘will do every-
thing in my power to set things
right.”’

Mercer concluded by saying,
“I am scared, yet all I can do
now is sit back and meditate on
my stupidity and weakness in the
solving of a problem. | am
quickly learning a day of stupidity
can negate years of hard work and
remain with one for a lifetime.”’

for equality and the opportunity to
make their way successfully in
life.

The ’80s have rolled around
and protesting has not gone out of
style. Only now, =I _ fully
understand the implications of
what is being protested. Like the
demonstrations of the ’60s and
70s, women today feel just as
strongly about their rights. They
have taken to the streets and
voiced their concerns; they are
standing up and being counted.

W&L has taught me_ that
education is everything. But
Politics 102 and Sociology 270
never taught me that in the real
world I would have to go beyond
reading and writing about personal
ideals. I understand now that they
are but a_ starting point from
which to make myself heard.

I realize that it is often
difficult to stand up for something
as volatile as pro-choice or pro-
life. The controversy has pitted
mother against daughter; neighbor
against neighbor; friend against
friend. But the lessons of the ’60s
and ’70s have kept nagging at me

short, cropped hair dyed black;
married women wearing Reeboks
and pulling baby carriages; and
older women who could remember
the days when there was no
choice. They all felt the same way
though, and it struck me that one
single cause could bring so many
people together at once.

I was apprehensive at first
about going. Would it be
dangerous? What if people I knew
saw me there? Would this be just
a left-over remnant of some far-
gone radical movement? Happily,
I discovered that it was an

The First Amendment of the
Bill of Rights guarantees every
citizen of this country a right to
peaceably assemble and a right to

testimonial to the veracity of these

together and make a statement is a
liberty to revel in.

knew what it meant to deny

recognized that the Bill of Rights
was meant not only to protect the
rights of the majority, but the

minority as well. Without the Bill
of Rights, we would not be able
to stand up and be counted.

I’m not ashamed to voice my
opinion, march in protest, or write
about my experiences. Speaking
out for pro-choice was a decision
made not just for me, but for
those who do not yet have the
courage to protest. The American
public is the greatest check on out
liberal, democratic regime yet
devised. I only wish more people
would recognize this.

I’ve found that most often it is

For the past month, — the
Interfraternity Council has been
working closely with the

Lexington Police Department in a
program designed to further
fraternity-police understanding on
a house-by-house basis.

Nearly half of W&L’s
fraternity houses have met so far
with Lieutenant Steven Crowder in
an effort to clarify a number of
problematic issues. The hour-long
sessions, held in various chapter
houses, focus primarily on such
controversial subjects as students’
right as residents of Lexington and
officers’ justification of probable
cause as well as specific charges,
including Drunk in Public and
Driving Under Intoxication. In
addition, reports Frank Kannapell,

Wé&L grad starting

The Ring-tum Phi, April 20, 1989

a winery in county

 

By Greg Euston
Staff Reporter

 

Shepard Rouse, who graduated
from W&L in 1976, is starting a
winery just up the road from his
alma mater.

Rouse recently appealed to the
Rockbridge County Planning Com-
mission to have his land rezoned
from residential to agricultural-
general. Rouse currently leases
the land to an Augusta dairyman
and now wants to use it to make
Rockbridge County wine.

His company, Rockbridge
Vineyard and Winery Co., should
begin releasing its first wine next
fall. Rouse said he wants to start
turning his dairy barn into a win-
ery as soon as he gets approval
from the county. A winery and a
dairy barn are very similar, said
Rouse, and it will take about ten
months to build the winery.

As soon as he gets the go-
ahead, Rouse said he is going to
Start planting his grapes. Grapes
are grown from stock, not seeds,
said Rouse. It takes about three
years for grapes to grow, and they
need about five years to teach
their full potential.

Until then, Rouse will have to
buy grapes from other growers in
the area. Lovingston is the clos-
est vineyard, said Rouse, and there
are other nearby vineyards in the

Shenandoah valley.

"Rockbridge County isn’t ex-
actly the Napa Valley,” said
Rouse, who said he is going to
depend on his skill and experience
as a wine maker to make his
wine. While in Germany on his
scholarship, Rouse began making
wine and continued for 12 years.
He then attended the University of
California at Davis and added a
graduate degree in wine making to
his W&L background in environ-
mental science.

Rouse plans to sell his wine on
site in the beginning, then state-
wide in the long term. "In Ger-
many, wine is food," said Rouse.
I hope by selling a $5.50 bottle of
wine, I can make people realize
that wine is not just for the rich
and famous, he said. "The key is
to make a product that most any-
one can enjoy and afford."

Rouse said he returned to
Rockbridge County because he
likes the area. The site he has
chosen is next to I-64 and 1-81,
and he said he likes it because he
wants to sell his wine on-site. In
the first phase of production, said
Rouse, he plans to use about 15
acres of his land for vineyard and
winery with eventual expansion to
about 100 acres.

Currently, Rouse plans to make
both red and white wines.
Because of consumer preference,

Rouse said, he is going to make
mostly inexpensive white wine and
some upscale red wine.

"There are some closely guard-
ed secrets in wine making," he
said. Time has shown that some
of the French methods of wine
making are the best, but innova-
tion also makes good wines, he
said. Today, he added, there is a
great deal of practical, affordable
technology available to help cut
comers.

Rouse said he can make a bot-
tle of white wine in about three
months, grape to bottle, including
a month for the wine to get over
"bottle shock". When wine is bot-
tled, it has to be filtered and
poured, and the wine needs to sit
in the bottle to recover from the
handling, said Rouse.

Initially, Rouse plans to
produce 5,000 cases of wine a
year. He plans on about $350,000
a year in gross annual sales. In
his appeal to the planning com-
mission, Rouse said what he is
doing will economically _ benefit
the county. First, he said he is
helping promote the cottage indus-
try in Rockbridge. These small
businesses are alternatives to fac-
tories and tourist traps.

Also, he said, a business like
this helps tourism in Rockbridge
without turning the county into a
"crass tourism area,"

Baseball wins
fifth straight

 

 

By Jay Plotkin
Assistant Sports Editor

The Washington and Lee base-
ball team has come up with a
knack for late game heroics.

In the midst of a five-game
winning streak, their longest since
1972, the Generals have won two
games in their last at bat. 1972
was also the last time that W&L
finished with a winning record,
and at 9-6 with just two games
left to play, the Generals are as-
sured of another winning season.

After dropping a doubleheader
to Shenandoah by one run in each
game, the Generals responded with
five straight Old Dominion Athlet-
ic Conference wins.

The first two wins came in the
form of a doubleheader sweep of
Emory and Henry. In the first
game, the Generals scored three
times in the sixth and seventh in-
nings to win 3-0. Freshman Steve
Momorella pitched the shutout for
the Generals.

The nightcap was a slugfest,
with the Generals scoring 10 times
in the last two innings to win 20-
11. Senior Rich Grace got the
win in relief for W&L.

The streak continued at Lynch-
burg. The Generals scored five
unearned runs in the top of the
ninth to earn their first regular se-
ason win over Lynchburg since
1984. Senior catcher Eddie Klank
started the comeback with a two-
run triple to make the score 3-2
Hornets. Grace, the designated
hitter, reached on a error, scoring
Klank with the tying run. Senior
Tony Waskiewicz completed the
comeback with a two-run home

run for the win. Senior Mike
Temple went the distance for his
second victory.

At home against Hampden-Syd-
ney, the Generals upset the second
place conference team, and once
again it came in their last at bat.
Klank was the hero for W&L, hit-
ling a towering home run to cen-
ter field, his third of the year, af-
ter Tom Skeen singled to start the
bottom of the ninth. Klank, who
was 4-for-4 on the day, got his
fourth game-winning RBI to make
a winner of Grace, who moved to
2-0 after relieving Temple in the
seventh.

Momorella took the mound in
Wednesday’s contest at Eastern
Mennonite. The freshman pitched
a complete game for an 8-6 win
to move his record to a perfect 4-
0. He scattered 13 hits en route
to his third complete game of the
season. The Generals iced the
game with two runs in the top of
the ninth to take an 8-4 lead.
Tim Wheeler drove in both runs
with a two-out single, scoring Kla-
nk, who was 3-for-5, and Skeen,
who was 4-for-4.

Wheeler’s single proved crucial,
as Momorella ran into trouble in
the bottom of the ninthh EMC
loaded the bases and scored twice
on infield grounders, but Momore-
lla got Marty Meadows to pop out
to end the game.

The Generals can assure them-
selves of hosting a first round
ODAC tournament game by win-
ning one of their last two games,
either against Randolph-Macon or
Hampden-Sydney. It would be
the first time that W&L has ever
played an ODAC first round game
at home.

The W&L linksters have once again gotten off to
a slow start only to hit stride in the past two weeks.
The Generals smoked Shenandoah’s course Wednes-
day en route to a team total 301, miles ahead of
Shenandoah’s 359. Freshman Clay Thomas carded a
71 to go along with sophomore Brian Kopet’s 73,
senior Tom Wingfield’s 78 and freshman Jay
McKnight’s 79.

“‘We burned it [Wednesday],’’ said head coach

This hot streak, Which seems so similar to last
spring’s late title run that gave the Generals the
ODACs and W&L its first ever team bid to the
NCAA championships, began last Friday at home in
a six-team ODAC Round Robin Tournament. The
Generals posted a score of 308, edging Roanoke by
two shots. Lynchburg was third at 316, followed by
Hampden-Sydney (317), Randolph-Macon (320) and
Bridgewater (324).

W&L was led by junior Ted Fox in this one,
who shot a 76 on the par-71 course. Senior co-
captain Pete Coleman and Wingfield each turned in
77s, while Kopet scored a 78.

The Generals continued to post low scores on
Tuesday, this time in tough conditions at an ODAC
Round Robin at Roanoke College. Despite a fierce
wind, W&L had three players break 80, winning the
mini-ODAC with a team score of 315. McKnight
(77), Thomas (77), Coleman (78) and Kopet (83) led

‘It’s a tough course anyway, but when the wind
“T thought
it was remarkable that we had three in the 70s.””

The golfers will most likely need to play even
more rounds in the 70s if they hope to repeat as
ODAC champs. One advantage certainly comes
from playing on their home course, and if you are
worried about the greens, worry no more.

‘‘The course is in excellent shape - well mani-
cured. It is superb,’ said Leslie. ‘‘It should be in
great shape for the ODACs.

Leslie also sees the Generals in good shape head-
ing into the championship.

‘We've got ourselves in the hunt,’’ he said. ‘‘I
think anyone can win it. You want to keep in posi-
tion after the first day. No one wants to shoot

themselves out of it during the first round.
“Golf's such a funny game.

Wa&L lacrosse
11-3 home loss

 

By Jay Plotkin
Assistant Sports Editor

 

For the Washington and Lee men’s lacrosse &

team, things seem to be getting worse as the season
grows longer.

After defeating Middlebury College 9-8 on
Wilson Field immediately before exams, the
Generals were beaten soundly by nationally ranked
arch-rivals Hampden-Sydney and Roanoke.

Against Middlebury, the Generals ran off four
straight goals to take a 4-1 lead after the opening
quarter. Sophomore Mike Pardo got the Generals
on the board with 13:02 left in the period off an
assist from classmate Todd Garliss. On the ensuing
faceoff, senior Stu Geisel won the draw and streaked
toward the goal. He found a wide open John Ware,
a senior co-captain in front of the goal to give
W&L a 2-1 lead just five seconds after Pardo’s
goal. Ware then fed sophomore Mike Moseman for
a goal and scored another goal himself to close the
first quarter scoring.

In the second quarter, sophomore Brian Overbeck
scored off an assist from Moseman to give the
Generals a 5-3 lead at the half.

In the third stanza, Ware found freshman Drew
Anton to extend the lead back to three goals, but
Ron Willett scored two of his four goals to bring
Middlebury within one at 6-5. Ware added his third
goal of the day to give the Generals a 7-5 edge
after three quarters.

The Panthers twice closed to one goal in the
final quarter after Overbeck scored his second goal
of the game for the Generals. When Damon White
scored his first goal of the day, the score was 8-7.
Jim Jones, a junior, had the answer for W&L, and
his goal with 7:00 left. gave the Generals an
insurmountable 9-7 lead. White scored again for
Middlebury to close out the scoring.

After a break for exams, the Generals travelled
to Hampden-Sydney for an Old Dominion Athletic
Conference game with the Tigers. It was Hampden-
Sydney’s greek week, and the Tigers had a party at
the Generals’ expense.

On a rainy day with mud flying everywhere, the
Generals hung tough for a quarter. H-SC led 3-0
after one quarter, and Garliss scored off a Ware
assist to start the second quarter. But 3-1 would be
as close as the Generals would get.

The Tigers ran off the next 12 goals to take a
15-1 advantage. During the run, Bob Babcock
scored three of his five goals on the day and Brad
Johnson three of his four goals and had six of his
seven assists.

The Generals then returned home to take on
Roanoke College. Ware scored early on to make
the score 2-1 Maroons, and then a familiar scene
occurred. The Generals offense took the next two-
plus quarters off, never really pressuring Roanoke
goalie Steve Mason, who made 15 saves on the day.

During W&L’s offensive hiatus, the Maroons
took a 9-1 lead behind the scoring of Jerry
Caramelli and Graham Calloway, who each had
three goals on the day, and Will ‘‘Bobcat’’
Goldthwait, who tallied two goals and two assists.
Douoguih put a little life in the Generals fire with
two fourth quarter goals, but it was not enough as
Roanoke prevailed 11-3.

From Staff Reports

 

The Washington and Lee wom-
en’s lacrosse team won three
of five games over spring
break and this week. The
Generals started by defeating
Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
ence rival Randolph-Macon
Woman’s College 14-9.

On Thursday the Generals
faced Hollins College in what
both teams knew would be a
close game. W&L, however,
came out on the losing end of
the 5-4 score. The Generals
traveled Sweet Briar College
on Friday for another ODAC
match. The Generals lost the
game 10-9 but rallied from a
9-6 deficit to make the game
close. On Saturday, W&L re-
bounded with a 14-9 victory
over Randolph-Macon/Ashland.

td

The Generals traveled to
Guilford yesterday and raised
their record to 6-6 with a 10-5
win.

 

The weather wasn’t cooper-
ative for the Washington and
Lee men’s track and field team
for the second weekend in a
row. Rain dampened the
WAL effort at the Catholic In-
vitational in Washington, D.C,
on Saturday, and it dampened
W&L’s preparations for this
week’s ODAC Championships,
as well.

 

W&L will be seeking its
third Old Dominion Athletic
Conference outdoor track and
field championship in a row at
this Saturday’s meet, which
will be held at Bridgewater
College. But it will be W&L’s
toughest ODAC title defense
ever, according to head coach
Norris Aldridge.

Rain and injuries are the
reasons, Aldridge said.

“It will be our toughest be-
cause we have a lot of people
injured,’ he said. ‘“But our
kids know it, and they know
what they have to do. Injuries
are part of any sport, and we
can’t let that bother us.”’

W&L did have some good
performances at the Catholic

=~» Tennis teams look for

sweep in conference

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

Come Friday and Saturday, the
Washington and Lee tennis teams
will have an opportunity to make
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
history.

Never before has the same
school captured both the men’s
and women’s titles, but both W&L
squads have an excellent chance to
do so. The men’s championships
will be held in Ashland at
Randolph-Macon College, while
the women’s championships will
take place right here on W&L’s
Own courts.

The men’s team, (7-9, 2-0 in
the ODAC, 5-1 against Division
Ill competition) has dominated
ODAC play in recent years, win-
ning the title the last four seasons
running. Last year the Generals
swept all six singles and all three
doubles flights to take the champi-
onship with a perfect score of 72
points. And for W&L head coach
Gary Franke, this weekend hopes
to be a repeat performance.

The Generals are using a solid
performance during a rugged spr-
ing break in Florida as momentum
intlo the ODACs. W&L split its
four matches, beating NAIA Flag-
ler 6-3 and D-I Stetson 6-3,
before falling to NAIA power
North Florida 6-3 and No. 4-
ranked D-II Rollins 5-4 in a close
match. |The Generals currently
hold the No. 4 ranking in the
NCAA D-III polls.

W&L is led by junior John
Morris, who is ranked in the top
five in the nation. Senior co-cap-
tain Bobby Matthews, last year’s

ODAC Player-of-the-Year, has the
vest individual singles record on
the team (13-3). As a doubles
team, Morris and Matthews are
ranked third in D-III.

The road to the NCAAs does
not end after this weekend’s

championships, however. The
men still have two tough matches
versus Emory University, ranked
No.11 in D-III, on April 29, and
highly-ranked D-II power Hamp-
ton Institute on May 6.

For the W&L women, this
year’s ODACs are a chance to
avenge last season’s second-place
finish, a mere one-half point be-
hind champion Sweet Briar. The
women, like the men, had a good
spring break, using the latter part
of the week for practice time.
The Generals posted wins over
Millsaps 7-2 and held on for a 5-
4 victory over Rhodes, the No.4-
ranked team in the South, W&L
also grabbed some key ODAC
matches on Tuesday and Wednes-
day, downing Sweet Briar 5-4 and
Lynchburg 9-0, respectively.

We really played some good
tennis last week,’’ said W&L co-
coach David McLeod. ‘‘We only
had one bad match (a loss to
Sewanee on April 8). We got in
a lot of good practice time.’’

Sophomore Jean Stroman,
W&L’s No.l player and 1988
ODAC Pilayer-of-the-Year, will be
looking to defend her ODAC ttle
at No. 1 singles, as _ will
sophomore No. 2 player Kelly
Martone. Junior Teresa Southard,
who won the title at No. 4 singles
last year, will try to do the same
at No. 3 singles this year.

The Ring-tum Phi, April 20, 1989,

 

‘Little Shop of Horrors’ is a Killer Production

Professor Al Gordon will direct the hit show at the University Theatre May 12 - 20

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

In 1960, writer Charles Griffith and director
Roger Corman put together a black comedy about a
carnivorous plant that turned his geeky owner’s
* future from rags to riches overnight. The film billed
as “‘the film shot in two days’’ and much later as
Jack Nicholson's film debut was well-received but
the reception was nothing like the play and film that
came from it.

In 1982, Howard Ashman and Alan Menken took
the story from Griffith’s screenplay and tured it
into an Off-Off Broadway musical called ‘“‘Little
Shop of Horrors.’’ Now only seven years since it’s
original inception, ‘‘Littke Shop of Horrors’’ will be
performed on the Washington and Lee campus
Starting May 12 and running through May 20.

What exactly is ‘‘Litthke Shop?’’ The answer is- a
lot of different things. The story opens in Mushnik’s
Skid Row Florist Shop where Mr. Mushnik is
announcing to his two employees, Seymour and
Audrey, that due to poor business he is closing the
shop. In desperation Audrey suggest that Seymour
put his ‘‘new’’ plant in the window to attract

 

customers. Much to everyone’s surprise, when
Seymour puts the Audrey II (named in honor of his
secret crush on Audrey) in the store window
customers begin pouring in.

The fun begins that same night when Seymour
pricks his finger on a rose thorn. As he goes to
wipe the blood off his finger the Audrey II sits up
and begins trying to suck Seymour’s finger. As
Seymour moves his finger closer to the plant the
Audrey II snaps at his finger as if to bite it off. To
do what he thinks will save the otherwise sickly
little plant, Seymour squeezes a few drops of blood
into the plant’s mouth and begs it to grow.

Grow it does! The cannibalistic Audrey II

continues to grow until it grows larger than Seymour
himself with total transformation climaxing as the
Audrey II begins to speak and sing.
From here on out, ‘‘Littke Shop of Horrors’ takes
numerous wild turns including ones involving a
sadistic dentist addicted to nitrous-oxide who just
happens to be Audrey’s greasy bohunk boyfriend.

In his Author’s Note at the beginning of the
script, Ashman says, ‘‘LITTLE SHOP OF
HORRORS 6satirizes many things; science fiction,

Faust legend.’’ The score is filled with wondertul
50s/60s doo-wop music and the special effects that
accompany the show are unbelievable.

To put on the show, four different models of the
Audrey. II are needed from a small flower pot size
plant to one that takes up the entire stage. W&L
senior Drew Platt has been working on the designs
for the Audrey II for the entire year and is heading
up the team of technicians that will put the monster
mound of foliage together. Once together, W&L
freshman Willie Henderson will actually sit inside
the plant as a puppeteer to make it move and dance
to the music.

Perhaps the most imyortant performers in the
production are Ronnette, Crystal and Chiffon who
will be performed oy W&L senior Courtney
Harpold, W&L freshman Koran Washington and
W&L senior Margaret Pimblett respectively. The
doo-wop trio is in almost every scene of the
production and act as a kind of morbid cross
between the Fates and the Supremes.

W&L senior Michael Carroll will perform the part
of Seymour, Audrey II’s owner and friend. Audrey,
the bubble-headed blonde who Seymour secretly
loves but who loves the sadistic Orin Scrivello will

 

be played by W&L senior Monica Burke who was
just granted admission to the Columbia University
Graduate School of Drama. Rounding out the three
cast members from the florist shop is W&L junior
Todd Peppers who will play the part of Mushnik,
the old New York jew who runs the florist shop.
W&L junior Scott Bell will perform the part of Orin
Scrivelio the sadistic dentist who eventually becomes
quite close to both Audreys. As stated, freshman
Willie Henderson will perform the movements of the
plant, ‘Sut the voice will come from W&L senior
Michae: Tuggle.

Other students inciuding Ryan Kull, Lee Fleming,
Nancy Hickham, Andrew Keller, Kristen Ramberg
and W&L Law student Amy Dillard will also be
performing in the production.

Fine Arts Department Head Al Gordon will be
directing the show that will run the fifth weck of
the spring term. As usual, opening night will be on
the Friday night of Alumni Weekend which is May
12 this year with the Closing night performance
coming cight days later on May 20.

Reservations are being taken now for the nine
performances at the University Box Office. The
number is 462-8637.

The Cult looks backward on
its new album Sonic Temple

By Bryant Spann
Staff Reporter

My mind races as I drop the
virgin disk into place and watch
the door of my CD player slide
shut. Which Cult will we hear
this time? The post-modern psy-
cho-band that gave use the 1985
Love album, or the streamlined
razor-rockers who cranked out
Electric in 1987? The first mea-
sures of the lead-off track "Sun
King" seem to indicate a return to
Love as Billy Duffy’s whining six-
string floats over an abyss of slid-
ing bass riffs and cymbal pings.
The band then launches into a
Zen-rock stomp that recalls the
Love single "Nirvana". But when
the chest-kicking drum track takes
over before the first verse, I say
to myself, "They’re up to
something." And indeed they are.
Ian Asterbury wails like a heathen
god as the song alternates between
verses of brain-crushing guitar and
bass roars and _highly-layered,
driving choruses. On Sonic Tem-
ple, The Cult have managed to
unite the spirits of their last two
albums. And it works.

They have accomplished this
fusion with the help of producer
Bob Rock, who recently worked
with Bon Jovi on New Jersey (but
we won't hold that against him).
Rock has given the album an
enormous, more complex sound

edges guitarist Duffy are allowed
more freedom to show off, while
bassman Jamie Stewart takes his
usual unobtrusive role. Session
drummer Mickey “Why doesn’t
this band get a permanent drum-
mer" Curry hits with the lead-
weight sound of a young John Bo-
nham, Well...almost!

Speaking of Bonzo, the band
sounds very Zeppelin-esque on
several cuts, like "Medicine Train"
and the "Black Dog" sound-alike,
"Automatic Blues". But the albu-
m’s most Zep-like tune is "Soul
Asylum",. The pulsing guitar licks
and chromatic bass line make you
expect the boys to launch into an
80’s remix of "Kashmir". So
does the drum track, which con-
tains the largest hi-hat crash in the
history of recorded sound. The
albums hardest rockers are "New
York City", on which master
growler Iggy Pop makes an

appearance, and the back-slapping
"Soldier Blue." I can’t tell you
about them. They’re just too
mean.

The real surprise cut on Sonic
Temple is "Eddie (Ciao, Baby)",
The Cult’s entry into the booming
"power ballad" market. The song
begins with a minor key, 12-string
acoustic line backed by a full or-
chestra. The unexpected smooth-
ness of Astbury’s tenor crooning
jumps at you, and the overall ef-
fect of the tune is that of a classic
ballad by Styx (what?!) or E.L.O.
(double what?!) The track does
rock, too. "So do you like it?"
"Yes," he said.

Enough talk. This album kicks
%$#. If you’re a Cult initiate, or
even a novice in this order, you’ll
worship Sonic Temple. To quote
Astbury, "Shake, you sinners," and
buy it. Andy “The Killer" Keller
digs it, too. When do they tour?

social statement number one Costello points
out the fallacy in equating money with
happiness and how sad it is that genius has to
be threatening before it is recognized.

“‘Let Him Dangle,’ an eerie disturbing
song whose chorus of ‘“‘let him dangle, let
him dangle’’ follows every four lines, is a
morbid song about a man who gets convicted

 

is, however, the genius of the song comcs
through the lyrics. God’s fool dics and goes
to heaven where he sees God sitting ‘‘on a

to Andrew Lloyd Webber’s ‘Requiem.’ He
said, before it had really begun, ‘I prefer the
one about my son’/ ‘I’ve been wading through

Margaret Thatcher, her foreign policy and her
tactics of defense.

“‘When England was the whore of the
world, Margeret was her madam’’ is the lyric
that opens the second verse. ‘‘Well I hope
that she sleeps well at night, isn’t haunted by
every tiny detail/ ‘Cos when she held that
lovely face in her hands all she thought of

the ballads on Spike is ‘‘Baby Plays
Around,’’ a wonderful, easy going song that
Linda Ronstadt could easily include on her
next Nelson Riddle album. Most of the song’s
beauty comes from its musical simplicity
though; that is, the sweet mix between
Costello’s voice and his guitar.

Costello picks up the tempo in ‘“‘Miss

deals with a man’s having to leave his wife

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA APRIL 27, 1989

 

 

By Mike Badger
Staff Reporter

 

In his first meeting as the new Interfraternity
Council president, Kevin Nash stated that improving
relations with the faculty and with the Lexington
community would be one of the major focuses of
the IFC next year,

Nash also said other goals of the IFC will
include drawing up and passing a good rush
calendar, making sure all fraternities understand
Clearly the rules for next fall’s rush and completing
a new rush book by the end of this school year.

Other long-term goals mentioned by Nash
included encouraging better scholarship within the
W&L fraternity system, working to make the
fraternity renaissance program a success, working
closer with the sororities in order to, ‘‘make their
transition ino the W&L Greek system as smooth as
possible,’’ a.d possibly sponsoring a Greek Week
next fall.

Nash stressed the importance of fratemity
involvement in more social service projects, and of
obtaining better publicity for projects that fraternities
are already involved in. He said these goals are two
of the keys to better relations with the faculty and
the community.

Already the IFC is encouraging fraternity
participation in at least three upcoming charity
events. The first event will be a jump rope contest
tomorrow. On Sunday, the March of Dimes is
sponsoring a walk-a-thon and the IFC is requiring at
least two brothers front each fraternity to participate.
The third event, scheduled for May 15, is the IFC-
sponsored golf tournament. Fraternities will donate
$100 to $120 to enter four-man teams. The money
raised from the tournament will go to the American
Cancer Society.

Nash said that maintaining programs such as
this year’s police dinner program will be important
in keeping up good community relations. That
program has brought local police officers to each
fraternity house in order to answer questions and tell

‘The Lord’ to hang up
whistle after 41 years

By Scott Richardson
Staff Reporter

 

This is the last year Wash-
ington and Lee University students
will have the unique opportunity
to experience the euphoria of run-
ning with The Lord.

Coach Norman F. Lord, know
to his colleagues as ‘‘Stormin’
Norman,’’ has reached the manda-
tory retirement age of 70. He
will hang up his whistle after 41
years of spirited service to Wash-
ington and Lee.

“IT believe in sweat and
movement,’ says Lord, who
seems in better shape than many
of his students and is hardly ready
to retire. A farm boy from. Dela-
ware and a football player at
heart, Lord played football at the
University of Delaware and was
also a track and field man for the
Blue Hens.

Always on the move, Coach
Lord, known affectionately by the

student body simply as ‘‘The
Lord,’’ teaches 24 classes a week.
“IT can’t stand to see a person

walk,”’ he says.

In his gray, windowless office
on the 200 level of the Warner
Center, Lord, in a white hat,
W&L polo shirt, sneakers, khakis
and wearing his ever-present whis-
tle, laughs robustly with a shining
smile. He is tanned, fit and has a
commanding presence. He calls
physical education ‘‘the labor of
my love.”’

Lord majored in education to
be a science teacher, but World
War II changed his plans. As the
draft thinned out Delaware’s facul-
ty, Lord, who was not drafted un-
til 1943, became director of intra-
mural sports, a receiver coach in
football, freshman basketball
coach, assistant track and _ field
coach and began teaching physical
education.

Finally drafted in February,
1943, Lord went to Army Officer
Candidate School and volunteered
for the 11th Airborne in World
War II. He also served in Korea
from 1950 until 1952.

Lord came to Washington and

Track may get facelift this summer

 

By Cecily Tynan
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee University’s track at
Wilson Stadium may get a face-lift this sum-
mer, if the Board of Trustees approves the
Athletic Department’s request for the construc-
tion of a new, all-weather track.

The board is scheduled to meet May 18-20
to review capital project proposals, including
the fourth consecutive request for the resur-
facing of W&L’s current cinder track,

Director of Athletics William D. McHenry
said, ‘“‘If it is approved {by the Board], we’d
like to have it under construction before June
1 and finished by August 1.’’

One week ago, an architect and a construc-
tion engineer visited W&L to study the stadi-
um and draw up a plan for the new track,
according to McHenry.

“I’m expecting to receive a written esti-
mate of expenditures by May 1. At that time
we will meet with President Wilson,’’ McHen-
ry said.

President John D. Wilson will make a

Graduate

recommendation to the board on whether or
not to accept the proposal after meeting with
the Athletic Department.

“The president is well aware. of our
needs. It will benefit not only track runners,
but the student body in general. A lot of peo-
ple like to jog,’’ said McHenry.

The board has rejected the track request
for the past three years.

Wilson said, “It’s a major expenditure on
the capital budget side and we’ve had to order
our priorities within the constraints of our
budget.”

“‘Also, we’ve been hoping to attract a
major private gift to offset part of the fund-
ing, but we haven’t been successful so far,”
he said.

Wilson said the proposal has a much bet-
ter chance of being accepted this year than in
the past.

“I’m not even entirely pessimistic that we
can’t get help from a private donor before the
board meeting in May,’’ said Wilson.

The main problem with W&L’s cinder
track is that water stands on it when it rains,
according to Norris T. Aldridge, coach of the

  

    

W&L men’s Track and Field Team and Asso-
ciate Professor of Physical Education.

““You can’t run on the track when it
rains,”” he said.

Wilson Stadium has not hosted any large
track invitationals recently since it is more
practical to schedule meets on all-weather
tracks, which are operable in the rain.

““We would have had ODAC’s here if we
had an all-weather track. But you’re taking a
chance [on rain] if you don’t have an all--
weather track,’’ Aldridge said.

The proposed six-lane track would be
made of latex material, similar to the surface
of the track at Virginia Military Institute’s
Alumni Field, and would require substantially
less upkeep than the current track, which
needs frequent raking, lining, and replacement
of cinders,

“Occasionally you will have to touch up
the lines, which are painted on the surface.
Every 6-8 years it will have to be resurfaced,
it depends on the amount of wear and tear it
receives... the upkeep is minimal. There is no
comparision to the upkeep required for a cin-
der track,’’ said McHenry.

Magazine seeks EC funds

to fly in
Shuttle

By Melinda Conkling
Staff Reporter

 

When the space shuttle takes
off from Kennedy Space Center in
Florida this November, David
Lowe, a 1978 graduate of Wash-
ington and Lee, will be part of the
five-man crew aboard.

Lowe, a physics and engineer-
ing major who also studied at
Cornell and Stanford, said that
he’s ‘‘extremely excited’’ about
the trip.

The shuttle weighs 4.5 million
pounds and travels at a speed of
17,500 miles per hour. Novem-
ber’s trip will last ten days, one
of the longest trips yet taken by
the shuttle.

On the first day in space, 190
miles above the earth’s surface,
the shuttle will deploy a communi-
cations satellite. After that, the
shuttle will rendezvous with and
retrieve a scientific satellite which
has been in orbit for five years,
The shuttle has a mechanical arm
that will ‘‘grab’’ the satellite and
place it on board the shuttle.
Some voyage time will be spent
doing medical experiments.

Lowe said that a common mis-
conception surrounding the space
shuttle missions is the supposed
aura of secrecy. Of the 28 mis-
sions completed, he said only
three have been under Department
of Defense secrecy,

A new student publication, vot-
ing regulations, an honor system
video and Evans Dining Hall dish
disappearances were the main top-
ics of discussion at the Monday,
April 24 meeting of the Executive
Committee.

The W&L Spectator, a new
student publication, will hit the
Colonnade with its first issue in
early May of this year. The Spec-

lator was presented as a news
magazine composed of in-depth
research and analysis of current
events. Paul Lagarde, Ray Welder
and Claude Williams, along with a
staff of writers, are seeking to
provide a forum for ‘‘enlightened
discourse’’ on ideas and issues
involving W&L, as well as current
national and international events.
An interview with John Warner
and Associate Dean of Students
Buddy Atkins are among the arti-
cles to be included in the May

issue, Lagarde stated that it was
their intention that the publication
not be characterized as anti-admin-
istration or solely a voice of con-
servative students at W&L.

Welder headed the group’s pe-
tition for $700 by the end of this
week to cover the cost of printing
the May issue. EC members rec-
ognized the merit of the new pub-
lication, but President Christopher
deMovellan stated that the ‘‘provi-
sional approval’ the Publications

Standing up| Paemmmemeeess Fs |
for a wrong?

By Dan Bettendorf

I am writing concerning the editorial
printed last week with the title ‘‘Freedom fails
without action.”” Miss Parkins seems to be
extolling protesting for its own sake instead of
the right to protest. She remarks that she did
not ‘understand’ the protests of the 60s at the
time; this is, of course, not surprising since
she was only a three-year-old child. My com-
plaint is, however, that she does not seem to
understand them now either.

In the 1960s people were ostensibly pro-
testing against government actions which
seemed ‘‘immoral.’’ They were doing some
thinking before they went out to wave ban-
ners. They were, I believe, protesting against
ideas such as killing people for purely politi-
cal reasons.

I wonder if Miss Parkins is fully aware of
what she was ‘“‘standing up and _ being
counted’’ for. I do not think I need remind
her that there are many who believe that un-
born fetuses have rights that must be defended
and are not a matter of a woman regulating
her own body so that she has the ‘‘opportuni-
ty to make [her] way successfully in life.’’

What I am questioning here is the judi-
ciousness of Miss Parkins’ decision to ‘‘revel
in’’ this liberty in this particular context. She
is quite right that the issue of abortion is a

A new track
finally (maybe)

As the story on page one of this week’s Phi indicates, the
W&L track program may finally be about to leave the 1920s.
According to President John Wilson, the chances that Wilson
Field’s track will finally be re-surfaced have never been

better.

That the track need re-surfacing is unquestionable. Standing
water remains on the track for days after a heavy rain; during
last fall’s Parents’ Weekend football game, the track looked

more like a moat or a cistern than a running surface.

Phi contained two articles that caught my
attention, namely ‘‘Is anybody out there lis-
tening’’ and ‘‘Freedom fails without action.’’
Well, as a Washington and Lee woman I was
listening, and decided to take action.

I was raised in the midst of political con-
troversy. My family has always been active

volatile one. The problem is that people are
assembling for some highly questionable rea-
sons. They want to maintain a ‘‘right’’ to
terminate pregnancies (a pro-choice euph-
emism for ‘‘abort fetuses’). I have never

as students at Washington and Lee to really

concerning issues in which they held strong
beliefs, but I was unwilling to let them simply
hand me the proverbial torch. I am a ‘‘Curi-
ous George’’ and always asked lots of ques-
tions. I have read books and articles, attended
lectures, and have been determined to under-
stand all sides of various issues because I
wanted my views to be precisely that -- my
views.

I have been active in the pro-life move-
ment for years, and there are millions of re-
sponsible women in this country who. stand
with me. Pro-life is very important to us, and
it means fighting for the one thing that all hu-
man beings have in common: life.

Let me suggest some food for thought.
When your sister or best friend gets pregnant,
you will not say ‘‘Jane is carrying an inani-
mate object that will turn into a life when it
is born!’ Rather you would say, ‘‘Jane is
going to have a baby!’’ Marches and protests
and letters are irrelevant when you consider
whether or not an unborn baby is a life. That

Despite practicing and competing on one of the slowest
surfaces imaginable, the W&L men’s track team has, with the
exception of men’s tennis, easily been W&L’s most successful
sport for decades. The Generals came within four points of
winning their fourth outdoor title since 1984 Saturday. Since
1950, the Generals have recorded 22 winning seasons. They
have not lost a dual meet since 1983, when they were a
disappointing (by their standards) 5-1. Norris Aldridge is one
of the most successful coaches W&L has ever known in any
sport. And the women’s team,. young as itis, is; already
showing signs of excellence.

Of course, as Athletic Director William McHenry points
out, the track at Wilson Field, when not under water, is used
by many members of the W&L community not on the track
and field teams. Students and faculty members should have
access to a useable outdoor track facility every day -- not just
when it hasn’t rained in the past week.

Wilson told The Phi he is ‘‘not entirely pessimistic that we
can’t get help from a private donor’’ to pay for the re-
surfacing. To us, that sounds like his little way of saying a
major donation may soon be announced. But, even if it isn’t,
we hope underclassmen will return in September to find a
new running surface on Wilson Field. And we hope the Board

No one claims that abortion
is morally good. Yet moral

consistency is exactly what
the better protestors of the
1960s demanded.

heard an argument yet which even attempts to
justify abortion in an ethical context. No one
dares claim that abortion is in any way moral-
ly good. And justifications and moral consis-
tency are exactly what the better protestors of
the 1960s demanded. This is the grand differ-
ence between the march on April 9 and the
protests of the period: then people were at
least making claims to intelligent thought, now
we simply raise our voices and chant the lat-
est phrases that have crossed our paths.

So I ask those who share this notion of
standing up for ‘‘something’’ to consider why
the pro-choice people are so contemptuous of
those who black abortion clinics. Pro-choice
advocates have a tendency to assume these
people are right-wing fundamentalists with no
intelligence whatsoever. In this respect they
are sadly incorrect. Consider, Miss Parkins,

If it is not a life there is no reason for all of

of life or death. The ‘‘anti-choice’’ factions

they have considered an issue deeply enough
to risk success for justice.

Once again, I am not at all convinced that

when you just stand up.

Unborn children possess detectable heartbeats
and brain waves within a month and a half
after conception. Babies being aborted also
react with movement to the abortion, as dem-
onstrated in Dr. Bernard Nathanson’s ultrason-
ic view of an actual abortion, ‘‘The Silent

sess very human physical features. They have

arms, legs, feet and a distinctively human ,

body.

Since the Roe v. Wade decision of 1973, °

into regions of science only dreamed of then.
Intra-uterine surgery to correct fetal problems
is performed daily in U.S. medical centers.

To the Editors:

I would not like to leave without saying how much I have
appreciated being part of the faculty of W&L. I enjoyed my
students. They were so enthusiastic and bright. This river of
youth is the most important force flowing through a university. I
wish them luck and wisdom in the future. I also wish to thank my
colleagues in the art department....Professors Larry Stene and
Kathleen Olson for their time and support in organizing and helping
to put up my show, to Betty Hickox for her efficiency and good
nature, to Professor Margaret Brower for her collaboration and
continued enthusiasm for joint work, to Professor Gordon for his
assistance and liason, and to Dean Simpson for everything!

To the Editors:

The members of the Judicial Board of the I.F.C. would like to
inform the student body of a recent proposal submitted to the
Student Affairs Committee. The proposal is that a panhellenic
member be added to S.A.C. as well as the addition of another
faculty member to balance out the committee at six students and
six faculty members. We do not doubt the legitimacy of a
panhellenic vote on S.A.C.; however, we, the LF.C. Judicial Board
members, are opposed to the reduction in the effectiveness of our

vote on this committee resulting from this proposal. Any other
proposal pointing to a similar end we find equally unacceptable,
because, we believe, any reduction in our voting power is an
affront to the nearly 800 fraternity members we, and our one vote
on S.A.C., directly represent. We believe that the fratemity vote
should be indicative of our responsibilities that extend throughout
the W&L community. We felt that the student body needed to be
aware of this matter concerning student affairs and our opinion on
the subject.

On behalf of Alpha Phi Omega I would like to thank all those
who helped us in this year’s OxFam America campaign against
world hunger. Although we were not quite as successful this year
as last, we did raise around $600 which will go to disaster relief in
Third World nations and long term self-development programs.

I wold like to extend a special thanks to those freshmen who
thoughtfully sacrificed their meals, and I hope that it was an
educational and enlightening effort. As always, this could not have
been accomplished without the support of Jerry Darrell and the

An inside view of Harris Teeter...
Was it really a plot to destroy Kroger? Ask Jon Sbar.

Sbar’s View:
History lesson - Teeter v. Kroger

 

By Jon Sbar

 

Right now, Lexington isn’t one
of America’s biggest cities, but it
has potential. According to a few
economist mental patients from the
Betty Ford Clinic for Famous
Drug Abusers, by the year 1999
Lexington will have all the advan-
tages of a metropolis -- a public
transit system, art galleries, opera
houses, insane taxi drivers, gang
violence, pollution and maybe
even a Betty Ford Clinic for Fa-
mous Drug Abusers.

The Betty Ford Economists,
who are very qualified (they took
economics in high school), have
the world-renowned GSG
(grocery store growth) method in
formulating their Lexington predic-
tions. The GSG method is predi-
cted..on the assumption that a: po-
pulation boom in a small city
starts with grocery stores. What
the study amounts to, in technical
terms, is this: | Lexington has
more grocery stores that Boston
has, so in ten years (1999), Lex-
ington will be bigger than Boston.

By this time rational readers
should be wondering where this
article is going. Even irrational
readers should be wondering
where this article is going. In
fact, I’m wondering where this
article is going. According to my
editors, this article should be go-
ing to Kroger and Harris Teeter
for a humorous comparison of
these two powerhouse supermar-
kets. Because I am a veteran gro-
cery shopper, I was the natural
pick for the assignment.

But before we get inside a gro-
cery store let me take the reader
on a little journey back in time.

Disturbing Professor Futch’s
"Popes" class by running around
and jumping on other dogs right

It all started in 1959 on Generic
Avenue in a small town some-
where in the United States with a
12-year-old boy named Harris
“‘the Milquetoast’’ Teeter. Harris
was happy making good grades in
school and watching public televi-
sion. He hated sports and spent a
lot of time by himself.

Three houses down the street
from Harris lived Butch ‘‘the Og-
re’’ Kroger, the neighborhood bul-
ly. Butch’s hobbies were vandal-
ism and fist fights. On a cold
day in November, Butch saw Har-
ris, who was returning home from
clarinet lessons. After a few de-
rogatory comments Butch smashed
Harris’s glasses and stole his clari-

net. As Harris walked home
trembling from Butch’s attack, he
vowed that one day he would get
even with Butch, even if it took
him until the 1980s. When Harris
learned that Butch was making a
fortune in Lexington, Va. with a
grocery store named Kroger, he
decided to open a competing gro-
cery store and put Butch out of
business.

As I walked into Harris Teeter
(the store) disguised as a shopper
I expected it to look something
like Kroger. Besides the fact that
it has food, Harris Teeter is noth-
ing like Kroger. Blue and pink
pastel colored walls and neon
signs directing you to the bakery,
the deli, the wine center or the
parking lot is something you ex-
pect from ‘‘Miami Vice,’’ not a
grocery store. Harris Teeter sells
more flowers than a greenhouse
and the aisles were filled with po-
lite little notices of apology like
this one: ‘*Due to Manufacturer
Production Problems They are
Currently Unable to Ship Us the

8.5 ounce Le Seur Early June
Peas. We Apologize for the In-

convenience...”

into Kroger and asked for Le Seur
Early June Peas you’d probably
get thrown out.

Harris Teeter sells magazines
like Southern Bride, Hairstyle and
Organic Gardening, while Kroger
is dominated by Vietnam Combat,
Guns and Ammo and Combat
Arms. At Kroger there are long
aisles of equal length; at Harris
Teeter there are vertical, horizontal
and diagonal aisles and a seafood
rotunda.

The most memorable _ thing
about Harris Teeter is its catchy
jingle, ‘‘The Only Low-Price Su-
permarket that Refuses to Act
Like One.’’ Rumor has it that
they almost went with ‘‘I Eat,
Therefore I Shop at Harris Tee-
ter.”

Be careful when you are put-
ting your groceries into your car
at Harris Teeter. The parking lot
is on a hill. As I unlocked my
truck I noticed that my shopping
cart was wheeling away at an in-
credible velocity headed for a
group of innocent women and
children. Luckily, an HT bagboy
trained to handle runaway shop-
ping carts was there to prevent
what could have been a disaster.

Despite the many advantages of
shopping at Harris Teeter (such as
bagboys trained to stop runaway
shopping carts), don’t forget about

your old friend, Kroger. I know I
was thankful for Kroger on that
cold November night at 3:30 a.m.
when I was suddenly overpowered
by a desire to eat four blueberry
muffins. You have to appreciate
a grocery store that is open 24
hours a day.

While I think it’s great that
Lexington has so many grocery
stores, what we really need are
some more churches, or maybe

Children born months prematurely
are given cutting edge medical
technology, and often survive to
become normal children, Clearly,
the child in the womb is not sim-
ply a ‘‘glob of cells’? as many
pro-choice advocates relate to the
public, since the child aborted at
ten to twelve weeks (the period of
development in which most abor-
tions occur) can feel pain, react to
stimuli, and be successfully surgi-
cally treated.

pro-choice position is that ‘‘wom-
en have the right to choose what
they will do with their bodies.”’
While | certainly believe in per-
sonal liberty, we must draw the
line on personal freedom when it
infringes upon the rights of others.
This is exactly what abortion does:
anyway you look at it, a life is
taken in abortion. In our socicty
of convenience and disposability,
the inconvenience of an unwanted
pregnancy is answered 4000 times
each day with the termination of a
life. Two lives, not one, are at
stake during pregnancy.

I cannot deny the fact that the
problems faced by a woman carry-

child are multiple. However, the
extinguishing of a life in a most
brutal manner cannot be the an-
swer to an inconvenience. Allter-
natives to abortion exist, and
many agencies are available to
help women who are dealing with
a crisis pregnancy. We as a soci-
ely must replace the ‘‘quick fix’’
of abortion with compassion, sup-
port, and real help to those re-
sponsible for a new life. The na-
tional scandal of an ‘‘easy’’ solu-
tion of murder in an unwanted
pregnancy glares shamefully on
our nation. It is time the facts
concerning abortion were widely
disseminated and the carnage stop-

Lee in 1946 as director of intra-
mural sports and assistant profes-
sor of P.E. Since then he has
served as a coach for varsity soc-
cer, track and field and cross
country and freshman wrestling.
He has also been an assistant bas-
ketball coach and the business
manager of athletics.

He has seen many changes in
his years at W&L and still has
strong feelings about the cheating
scandal of the early 1950s that led
to the de-subsidization of varsity
sports.

“The cheating involved many
Students outside the football
team,’’ he said. Students had ob-

tained and were selling exams.
‘‘One of the ring-leaders of the
scandal was a non-athlete,’’ he
said.

‘*Every one of those kids who
graduated under subsidization has
been successful,”’ he said.

A runner, Lord has hit the
pavement, so to speak, all over
the world. ‘I’ve run on a hotel
roof in Tokyo, in a strawberry

Rico and in a parking lot in De-

“There is nothing like a good

special workout to help his
charges in P.E. 154, Aerobic Run-

ning. Three sets of chin-ups to the
point of failure followed immedi-
ately by a 12-minute run, then 25

To dry off, he likes students to

Ask anyone on the campus of
W&L about Coach Lord. The re-

Outing Club branches out

 

By Laura Dodge
Staff Reporter

 

A new branch of the Outing
Club recently formed to protect,
conserve, and maintain the envi-
ronment. Under the direction of
Kirk Follo, those interested dis-
cussed immediate plans to recycle
aluminum cans, computer paper
and other paper.

The InterFraternity Council ag-
reed to require all fraternities to
gather recyclable aluminum cans.
Members will begin _collectin

cans from fraternities on Tuesday
mornings at 10 a.m. in the Outing
Club’s van. The W&L community
can help by using the separate
trash cans designated for recycle-
able aluminum cans and paper that
will be placed in academic build-
ings and dormitories.

Recycling cans is only one
way to help reduce waste and pol-
lution. The club’s plans for the
near future include an Environ-
mental Awareness Day and the
maintenance of trails on House

There will soon be "Save
House Mountain" T-shirts on sale
in the Bookstore and Co-op. The
money raised by the sales will
support Lexington’s effort to save
House Mountain from being sold
to the town. In addition, four local
bands have expressed an interest
in a spring concert for the sake of
environmental conservation, and

EC...

 

(continued from page 1)

Board granted to the Spectator
blocks the EC from releasing fun-
ds. The EC can release funds to a
student publication only after it
has received an unconditional ap-
proval from the Publications
Board.

De Movellan suggested two
courses of action. Either the Publi-
cations Board could delay a final
approval of the magazine and re-
lease funds to the Spectator from
its own- account or the board
could approve the magazine and
the EC could create an account
for the Spectator. Time became an
issue, as the magazine organizers
stated that they needed the money
this week. De Movellan  sug-
gested that the board and the EC
will hold special meetings to make

publication possible.

At the meeting EC members
also discussed extending voting
hours for student body elections.
Third year law rep. Dave Nave
proposed that hours be extended to

reflect the class schedule, from 8
a.m. to 6 p.m. Currently, polls are
open from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and in
the most recent Big Three elect-
ion, 68 percent of the student
body voted. Senior EC Rep. John
McDonough further proposed that
hours be extended into the night.

De Movellan opposed extending
hours into the night. He stated that
students who were concerned
about voting should be able to get
on campus within a 10-hour peri-
od and vote. In addition de Move-
llan pointed out that nighttime vot-
ing hours would substantially de-
lay the tabulation of results. The
EC voted to approve extending
voting hours on all elections, so

until 6 p.m.
In other EC business, McDon-

ough and Alston Parker reported
on a video the EC is producing to
introduce honor system to prospec-
tive students, the freshman class
and new faculty members. A
script has been finalized, based on
a skit between students debating
on whether or not to cheat on ex-
am. McDonough reported that a
budget of $6500 was needed to
produce the video.

EC members also discussed a
request from the management at
Evans Dining Hall conceming EC
action to curb the theft of dishes
and utensils by student patrons.
Sophomore Rep. Willard Dumas
pointed out that the EC must de-
termine whether a student should
be dismissed from W&L for tak-
ing a dining hall fork. Members
voted to appoint Junior Rep. Bran-
don Canaday to look further into

the release of funds and on time that polls are open from 8 a.m. the matter.

Women’s lax
geis revenge,

trips Hollins

‘said Hathorn.

 

By Amy Packard
Staff Reporter

 

Janine Hathorn, head coach of
the Washington and Lee women’s
‘lacrosse team, was understandably
‘In a good mood last night. Her
‘description of W&L’s first-round
‘Old Dominion Athletic Conference
tournament game against arch-rival

‘Hollins College was overflowing
_ .with strong adjectives.

’

“It was an awesome game,”
“The whole team
played beautiful defense. The
scoring, too, was key and well

",done.”’

W&L beat Hollins 7-5, aveng-

. ing a 5-4 loss earlier in the sea-

son. Hathorn had nothing but
praise for those who did the scor-
‘ing. Freshman Kimberly Bishop,
who plays first home, scored the
first two goals and also handed
out two assists. Sophomore Brook
Tinley, at second home, followe¢
‘with a third first-half goal.
Halftime found the game tied
at 3, so  Hathorn’s _ pep-talk
Stressed maintaining possession of
the ball, and the team came cut

_ determined to do just that.

W&L's left attack wing Shawn
Werlyga sophomore, racked up

_ three ods and freshman Devon
McAllister, substituting for Tinley,
‘scored the final goal.

While her teammates were
busy scoring goals, freshman goal-
‘ie Erica Ingersoll was busy mak-
ing sure Hollins didn’t do the
same,

“Erica had an amazing game,”’
said Hathom. ‘‘She made 23
saves and we figured out that her
‘saving percentage was 82 per cent
for the game.”

Regarding strategical prepara-
‘tion, Hathorn said the team con-
centrated on its defense and tried
to anticipate the moves of Hollins’
‘best players. This technique
worked perfectly, but Hathorn was
struck by another aspect of the
team’s performance.

“The observation I made
which impressed me the most was
the heart and spirit we played
with. Hollins played just as hard,
though, so it was even more grati-
fying to win,”

The game followed on_ the
heels of a disappointing cancella-
tion on Monday. Virginia Tech
backed out of what was scheduled
to be the Generals last home
game.

“‘T think we recovered extreme-
ly well from that let-down,’’ said
Hathorn.

W&L, 7-7, enters the second
round of the ODAC tournament
on Friday when the Generals trav-
el to Salem to take on Roanoke
College.

Hathormn is looking forward to
that game but is still euphoric
aoout the victory over Hollins.
She even slipped into a little ide-
alism with the comment, “‘Every-
thing just came together in the

end--just like in Hoosiers.”’

For the 1989 Washington and
Lee baseball team, the post season
has arrived.

And fortunately for W&L, for
the first time, the Generals hosted
an Old Dominion Athletic
Conference tournament game. On
Wednesday, the Generals took on
Eastern Mennonite in a
quarterfinal game at Smith Field.

The two teams had _ played
twice in the season, with W&L
winning both times. Freshman
pitcher Steve Momorella got the
win in both of those games, and
although it is difficult to beat a
team three times in one season,
Momorella got the start once
again against the Royals.

Momorella and the Generals
wasted no time in asserting their
presence. Momorella sent the
Royals down in order in the top
of the first, and in the bottom
half, the Generals bats went to
work. After senior shortstop
Harry Halpert grounded out, senior
third baseman Tony Waskiewicz
doubled off the right-center field

wall. Tom Skeen, the senior
center-fielder, then walked, and
senior catcher Eddie Klank singled
to left field, scoring Waskiewicz.
The run proved to be Klank’s fifth
game winning hit of the season as
the Generals went on a tear.

In the second, Max Petzold,
the first baseman, singled with one
out. Second baseman Bobby
Rimmer, a junior, singled him to
second, and Petzold, a senior was
forced out on a questionable call
on Halpert’s ground ball to third.
Waskiewicz then singled to score
Rimmer from second. Skeen then
doubled off the base of the left
field wall, driving in Halpert and
Waskiewicz. Skeen’s double
chased EMC starter Doug Friesen,
who fell to 2-6 on the season.

Jerry Arbogast, the new
pitcher, hit Klank on the elbow

with his first pitch. Grace then
singled, scoring Skeen.
Sophomore right fielder Tim

Wheeler then crushed a pitch to
right field, sending it well over
the wall for a three-run homer, his

first of the season.
W&L led 10-0 after two
innings. The Generals scored five

more times in the third, off Carl

Ness, the ace of the Royals staff,
keyed Wheeler’s two-run
double. All told, the Generals
took batting practice in the first
three innings, registering 15 runs
on 16 hits.

Momorella pitched well enough
to win, moving to 6-0, but had to
come out after reaching the 100-
pitch mark and running into
trouble in the sixth. Senior Chris
Cunningham came on to pitch the
final three-plus innings to earn his
first save on the season.

Skeen was four-for-four, Grace
four-for-six, and Rimmer three-for-
five to lead the W&L_ attack.
Wheeler drove in a career-high
five runs, while Skeen and Grace
had 4 RBI apiece in the 18-8 win.
All told, the Generals pounded out
22 hits.

The Lexington Country Club
golf course was burned this week.
Not literally, but figuratively.

In the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference golf championships on
Monday and Tuesday, six teams
posted up some of the lowest
scores in conference championship
history. When the = smoked
cleared, Lynchburg had taken the
team title with an unheard-of two-
round total of 597. Washington
and Lee, despite shooting some of
its best golf ever, could finish no
better than fourth.

“‘{Lynchburg] definitely won
it,’ said W&L head coach Buck
Leslic. ‘‘We’re a little disappoint-
ed but that’s a temporary thing.
Those are the best scores we've

had since that cra (the — late
1970s).”’

W&L, with a score of 300,
found itself in striking distance

One of the more pleasant surprises this sports

‘ year has come from the 1989 Washington and Lee

baseball Generals.

The baseball team has risen above expectations to
put together their best season in 17 years. For their
success, the baseball team has been chosen as the
Ring-tum Phi Athletes-of-the-Month for April.

For the first time in the school’s history in the
Old Dominion Athletic Conference, W&L played
host to a tournament game and routed Eastern
Mennonite 18-8.

It is not just the fact that the Generals have
achieved what they have, but the way in which they
did it. By sweeping a three game series from West
Virginia Tech to start the season, the Generals got
off to one of their best starts ever.

The Generals were 4-6 after dropping a double-
header to start the month at Shenandoah. From
their W&L took off, winning seven of their last nine
to get where they are right now. The leaders during
the streak have been freshman starting pitcher Steve
Momorella, who is 6-0 with a 2.98 earned run
average, and senior catcher Eddie Klank, hitting .370
for the season with four homers, 20 runs batted in
and five game winning hits.

‘‘We were cruising along, unsure of ourselves
until we beat Lynchburg,’’ said senior tri-captain
Mike Temple. ‘‘We didn’t believe in ourselves, and

and have been unstoppable since then,”’

Late inning heroics have been the mode of
triumph for the Generals, earning five of the seven
wins, all five in a row, by scoring in the last two
innings. In sweeping a double header at Emory &
Henry, the Generals scored three times in the last
two innings to take the opener 3-0 and 10 times in
the last two innings to take the night-cap 20-11.

At Lynchburg, the Generals scored five times in
the ninth to win 5-3, with the winning runs coming
on senior third baseman Tony Waskiewicz’s home
run. Against second place Hampden-Sydney, Klank
settled a tie game in the bottom of the ninth with a
booming home run to center field to break a 4-4 tie
and give W&L a 6-4 win.

In April, the Generals have raised their team
batting average from .275 after 13 games to .315
after their ODAC tournament win over Eastern
Mennonite. Leading the way are Klank, .370, senior
center fielder Tom Skeen, .347 up from .250, and
Grace, .410 up from .333, Waskiewicz, .333.

Said Temple, ‘“‘We’ve played together for three
or four years, and we’ve finally come together. Due
to the senior leadership, mainly Eddie Klank’s, and

freshman, especially Steve Momorella, Brian Harper,
and Pete Klingelhofer. We're finally where we

want to be.”’
Congratulations to the Washington and Lee
baseball team, the Ring-tum Phi Athletes-of-the-

Month for April.

Tennis teams complete conference double

 

By Stu Sheldon
Staff Reporter

 

Both the Washington and Lee
men’s and women’s tennis teams
brought home the gold this past
weekend for Washington & Lee.

Men’s head coach Gary Franke
has to be very excited, as he was
named ODAC Coach-of-the-Year
for the sixth time. More
importantly, though, his netters are
playing quality tennis again.

Every W&L singles player won
his flight. At No.1, John Morris
grabbed not only the championship
but also ODAC  PLayer-of-the-
Year honors. Senior co-captains
Bobby Matthews and Robert
Haley, playing at No. 2 and No. 3
for the Generals, both won as
well,

tention.

“We thought it could come
down to us and Lynchburg,’’ said
Leslic. “‘We just didn’t make a
very good run at it.”’

The Generals received an ex-
cellent performance from freshman
Jay McKnight, who finished tied
for second with a 148 (73-75),
one stroke behind medalist Mike
Crabtree of Lynchburg. Seniors
Tom Wingfield (78-79) and Pete
Coleman (76-80) also played well
for W&L. Freshman Clay Thom-
as carded an impressive 73 in the
first round, but his second round
of 78 was disqualified when he
signed a wrong scorecard.

The mistake proved not to be a
serious one, only costing the Gen-
crals two strokes. Even with
Thomas’ score counting, the Gen-
erals would have finished two
strokes, instead of the actual four,
behind Roanoke’s 610. Randolph-
Macon held on for second place
with a 606.

How could anyone resist the
“Rubber Duckie’’ song, or those

was definitely my favorite,

Today it seems like just
yesterday but in reality it was 15
years ago. In years to come when
I look back on my life, I have no

doubt that ‘“‘Sesame Street’’ will
hold some of the _ fondest
memories of my childhood. It’s

not often that we are ever given
the chance to relive parts of our
childhood, but this Sunday at
VMI’s Cameron Hall, we all can.

members of the W&L Chorus, an

The concert, sponsored by
Washington and Lee and _ the

medleys from ‘‘Sesame  Street’’
and the Broadway stage ranging
stylistically from rock to jazz to

very hard. The show was an
unbelievable success.””

Kolman also _- praised
Washington and Lee’s support of
the University/Rockbridge County
Symphony Orchestra. During the
past year W&L has, for the first

 

time, supported the symphony
financially and has given students
participating in the ensemble

academic credit.

“W&L thinks music and drama
and the arts are so important that
it is willing to support them
financially, Kolman said.’ ‘‘In a
day and age when orchestras are
closing almost monthly, its to

Though last year’s Family Pops

E

concert was similar to this year’s
show, Kolman said he wanted to
put together a show that crossed
between the younger children and

the college students. Enter Bob
McGrath.

“McGrath has that universal
appeal’’ Kolman said.  “‘His
repertoire includes pop, country

and rock as well as all the songs
from ‘‘Sesame Street.’ He has a
formal musical background and
has a beautiful lyric tenor voice.”

And indeed, McGrath does
have an impressive background.
After graduating with a B.A. in
music from the University of
Michigan, McGrath eventually
went on to receive a master’s
degree =o music “from the
Manhattan School of Music in
New York City. After graduation,
McGrath sang with Fred Waring,
fgor Stravinsky and Robert Shaw,
just to name a few.

After working in New York,
McGrath travelled to Japan where
he enjoyed a successful career
singing popular music. Hoping to
carry his success across the ocean
back to the U.S., McGrath
returned to New York in 1969, It
was then, when he met an old
friend from Michigan, that his life
and his career would change
forever.

When his friend first suggested
“this new educational children’s
show with puppets’’ McGrath
knew immediately that he wanted
no part of it. Half a year and
many, many auditions later, having
come to the realization that
“Sesame Street’? was more than
just some kiddy show, McGrath

NEW IN
LEXINGTON

The Ring-tum Phi, April 27, 1989

2rt debuts Sunday

Bob McGrath will host the extravaganza

successful children’s program in
the history of television.

According to McGrath,
‘Sesame Street’? is now seen in
more than 80 English-speaking
nations and in 12 countries with
foreign co-productions in Spanish,
German, French and Portuguese.
They are all, however, quite
unique.

The production in Isracl, for
instance, is hoping to be just as
influential as the one in the
United States. In Israel, half of the
cast is Isracli and half is Arab;
definitely something unique in that
country. McGrath said that the
focus of that particular cast, much
like the one in most countries, is
to show that people who are
different can live together.

Over the years = “Sesame
Street’” has taught us all that
lesson but it has also taught us
much, much more. McGrath
recalled a story that happened to
him just a couple of weeks ago
that illustrates just how
wonderfully influential ‘“‘Sesame
Street’’ has been.

“‘T was in the Newark airport
and the girl behind the ticket
counter recognized me,” he said.
‘We got to talking and when we
were through I said kind of
jokingly ‘I guess we changed your
life. Right?” And she said, ‘Yes,
you did.’

‘I grew up in the worst of the
Newark projects with violence. and
drugs all around me. It was all I
knew. But ‘‘Sesame Street’’ was
the one calm part of my day and
when I saw it, I knew that there
was some place different in the
world where different kinds of
people lived together and got
along, I decided then that when I
grew up I was going to get out of
these projects and go to college.’
She did go to college and now
she works for the airline,”
McGrath said. ‘‘Stories like that
make it all worth it.”’

You can be sure that McGrath
and the rest of the cast of the
spring Family Pops concert will
bring that same ‘‘Sesame Street’
magic to this Sunday’s concert at
Cameron Hall. Come hear “‘The
Sesame Street Song,’ ‘The
People in Your Neighborhood’’
and ‘‘Trash’’ as well as the
production numbers from ‘42nd
Street’’ and ‘‘Barnum.’’ The
afternoon promises to be
entertaining and memorable for
all.

Tickets will be $10 for adults
and $5 for students. Everyone
come and support the orchestra,
the chorus, the Lexington children
and Bob McGrath. Come and
relive your childhood. I’m going
and Ernie’s not even going to be
there.
