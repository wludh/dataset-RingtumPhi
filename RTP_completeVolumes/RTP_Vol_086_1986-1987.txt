New head chosen for |

English department

 

By JASON LISI
Editor

 

Professor of English Edwin D.
Craun will become the head of the
department of English next July,
pending approval of the Board of
Trustees, Dean John W. Elrod said
Monday.

“ The previous department head,
Professor Sydney M. B. Coulling
resigned the post in late July for
health reasons following a heart at-
tack earlier that month, Elrod said.

President John D. Wilson and
Elrod will recommend Craun’s ap-
ointment to the Board of Trustees at
its meeting in late October. Elrod
said almost all recommendations of
this type are followed by the board.

Craun, who is on academic leave
‘this year, will begin his term on July
‘1, 1987. Professor W. Dabney Stuart
has been the acting department head
since Coulling’s resignation and will
‘continue until Craun takes over.

Craun said he will consider some
changes in the curriculum of the
English department, such.as greater
emphasis on post-World War II
literature and courses on the history
of the English language. He added,
however, that he thought Coulling

has administered the department
well during his term and “there are
no significant areas that the depart-
ment needs specific attention.”’

Craun was Assistant Dean of the
College of Arts and Sciences from
1977 to 1979 and an Associate Dean
from 1979 to 1981.

Elrod said Craun was chosen
because of his administrative ex-
perience, research work and publica-
tions and that his appointment had

 

 

 

EDWIN D. CRAUN

“strong support’’ from the other
members of the department.

Elrod said he had sent a letter to
the members of the department on
July 28, telling them of Coulling’s
resignation. On August 14, a letter
was sent out naming Craun as the
new department head, he said.

Between July 28 and August 14,
Elrod met with the members of the
department to discuss a replacement
for Coulling and other issues concer-
ning the English department, he
said. Out of these meetings came
Craun’s recommendation, which was
passed on to President Wilson.

Coulling will be teaching one of the
two courses he was scheduled for
when he had a heart attack July 5.
Coulling’s winter term teaching
schedule will depend on his health in
the fall, Elrod said. Coulling has been
teaching at Washington and Lee for
30 years and has been department
head since 1978.

Craun received his bachelor’s
degree in English from Wheaton Col-
lege in Wheaton, Ill. He has a doc-
torate with a concentration in
medieval and renaissance English
from Princeton University in
Princeton, N.J.

Read may face disbarment over sex charges

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Special to the Phi

 

A sexual misconduct hearing against
former Rockbridge County Commonwealth’s
Attorney Beverly C. “John” Read was
scheduled to resume this morning before a
three-judge panel in the Rockbridge County
Courthouse.

The hearing is disciplinary, rather than
criminal, and was brought about by the
Virginia State Bar. It was recessed July 10,
the day after eight women graphically
testified about allegedly obscene sexual
“»havior or remarks made by Read. Two

ichmond psychiatrists were subpoenaed

Wearlier this week to testify at today’s hear-

ing.
Read, 42, temporarily stepped down as the
area’s chief prosecutor July 11. He quit July
’ 18, after the Lexington City Council and

Rockbridge County-Buena Vista Bar Asso-
ciation both voted for his resignation. He had
been commonwealth’s attorney for the con-
servative college city of Lexington and
surrounding rural Rockbridge County for
more than 10 years,

At the first day of the hearing on July 9,
seven women who had sought Read’s advice
as a private attorney said that he had fondled
them, stroked himself, rubbed his stocking
feet on their legs or made lewd comments to
them. One said Read had exposed himself in
his office and had tried to force her to have
oral sex with him.

An eighth woman, who had worked with
Read in the local court system, testified that
during phone conversations about court
cases, Read would describe in crude terms
the sexual acts he wanted to perform on her.

All of the alleged acts were said to have oc-
cured between 1977 and 1984. Several of the
women said they kept Read as their lawyer

because they couldn’t afford another at-
torney or didn’t want to interrupt their legal
cases. Most of them sought his help in child-
custody or divorce cases.

The defense did not present its case on the
second day of the July hearing. Instead,
Read’s attorney, Joseph M. Spivey III of
Richmond, asked for a continuance of up to
six months to prepare ‘mitigating
evidence.”’ Spivey’s request came after
almost two hours of conferences with Read,
his family, the judges and the other at-
torneys. It was met with considerable outery
from local attorneys and the women who
testified.

Circut Judge Thomas N. Nance of Rich-
mond, chief judge of the panel, postponed the
hearing until Jan. 8, 1987. But after a number
of public complaints, the date was moved up
to Sept. 11.

If Read is found guilty of the sexual
misconduct charges, he could be disbarred,

have his law license suspended for up to five
years, or be given a reprimand, all of which
could be appealed to the state Supreme
Court.

Last month, one of the women who testified
against Read filed a $250,000 lawsuit accus-
ing the former commonwealth’s attorney of
“gross legal malpractice’’ and behavior con-
stituting assault and battery. Glenda
Dameron charged that in office appoint-
ments from 1981 to 1984, Read made lewd
comments to her and put his hands on her
breasts and buttocks.

She said Read counseled her improperly on

a marriage and pregnancy. And she said that
Read and his investigators repeatedly
harassed her once he discovered that she had
filed charges with the state bar.

Read has asked that Dameron’s case be
dismissed. In papers recently filed in Circut
Court, he contended that the suit had no
validity in the law and that her allegations

exceeded the two-year statute of limitations.

Read, a republican with strong family ties
to Rockbridge County, is a 1965 graduate of
Virginia Military Institute, a 1971 graduate
of the Washington and Lee University School
of Law, and a Vietnam War veteran. He was
in his third four-year term as com-
monwealth’s attorney.

Read has been especially controversial at
W&L because of his handling of a 1984 alleg-
ed murder arson case involving the death of
a W&L student and because of a recent
special grand jury investigation of area drug
use and trafficking.

Although Read still has his supporters,
community criticism began to mount in late

' 1983, shortly after the grand jury probe

began. The local bar association formed a
special committee to investigate the ad-
ministration of justice in the area in March
1984.

86 Calyx
arrives on
schedule

ee)

By SEAN BUGG
, Editor

 

 

‘~ Although the copies of the 1985-86
Calyx, the Washington and Lee year-
book, have arrived to be handed out
during matriculation, this year’s
book faces a dilemma — there are no
editors.

‘“‘We’re very happy with the book,”
said senior Dennis Francis, who

- edited the ’86 book with senior
Charles Nusbaum. The two feel that
a senior would be an unrealistic
choice for editor because the recent
Calyxes have covered the entire
school year, including graduation.
This would require a senior editor to

* work on the book after he graduated.

» A new graduate who is more con-

cerned with something else, such as
his first job, will not have the time to

* produce a quality yearbook over the

summer.

Also, he might not be able to return
to the W&L campus at the beginning
of the next year to wrap up all the
business.

The ’86 Calyx editors attribute the
“no-editor” situation partly to the
fact that this year’s sophomores, who
comprised much of last year’s
staff, ‘don’t want to make the
move,” and take such a large respon-
sibility

 

The 1986 Calyx will be passed out tomorrow.

Another problem is that people
tend to think that there is no staff and
the editor does all the work

“The staff is there,’ Francis said,
adding that there were already peo
ple who would like to edit sections of

the book, as well as student photo-
graphers and layout artists. Both
Francis and Nusbaum expressed a
willingness to continue work with the

GHQ changes ban pitchers

 

SSE

By MATHEW HORRIDGE
Assistant News Editor

 

Recent changes in menus and pay-
ment plans at Evans Dining Hall,
General Headquarters and the Co-op
offer students greater convenience
and a variety of food, but tighter
security may hamper possible
underage beer drinkers in the GHQ,
according to Director of Food Ser-
vices Gerald J. Darrell.

While point cards can be used in
the Co-op, there will be no pitchers of
beer sold on Wednesday nights in the
GHQ, he said.

Wednesday-night live entertain-
ment in the GHQ frequently attracts
students both above and below the
legal drinking age in Virginia. ‘We
had problems with people passing

pitchers around”’ to minors, Darrell
said. Beer will be sold only in 14-
ounce cups, he said.

Underage people drinking in the
GHQ will be asked to leave and not
allowed to return to the tavern for
two weeks, Darrell said. Those who
resist leaving will be reported to the
Student Control Committee, he said.

Unlike last year, 20-meal plan con-
tract patrons will not be able to have
their contract meals in the GHQ, ac-
cording to Manager William R. Tor-
rence. He says the tavern’s kitchen
facilities were not designed for the
volume of contract patrons who want
to eat dinner in the GHQ.

New sandwiches have been added
to the lunch and dinner menus and
some popular lunch sandwiches are
now available for dinner, Torrence
said.

A new system in Evans Dining Hall

will allow diners to pay only for a
salad if they wish. The line atten-
dants are now positioned at the door-
ways of the dining hall, instead of
just outside the kitchen, to make
meal selection and entrance to the
dining hall easier.

This system is subject to the Honor
Code, however, Darrell said. Diners
choosing something they did not pay
for will be in violation of the code, he
said.

The GHQ closes at 7:30 on Tuesday
and Thursday evenings and all day
Saturday this year due to lack of
business. Darrell and Torrence said
they are considering other changes to
the GHQ, such as Monday Night
Football specials, live entertainment
on Friday nights and keeping the
basement game room open after the
tavern’s closing time.

Freshmen SATs rise slightly

By SEAN BUGG
Editor

 

Average freshman SAT scores rose
slightly this year, according to
Washington and Lee's Admissions
Office.

The Class of 1990 scored an aver-
age of 579 verbal and 620 math, a 3
point increase in both categories. The
English Achievement test score was
475, a ten point rise over last year’s
freshman class

 

In a breakdown of the class by
home state, Virginia is first with 62
students. The next five are Mary-
land, 39; Texas, 31; Florida, 26; and
Pennsylvania and New York with 23
each.

Twenty-five of the incoming fresh-
man were valedictorian or saluta-
torian of their class. Thirty-nine were
National Merit Finalists.

Fifty-nine freshman were presi-
dent or vice-president of their class,

and 73 were president of a major or

ganization. One hundred four were
varsity athletic team captains.

Forty-seven were editors of their
school newspaper, literary maga-
zine, or yearbook.

One hundred thirty-nine were Na-
tional Honor Society members, and
27 attended either Boy’s or Girl’s
State.

Sixty-four children of alumni and
six minority students are in the
freshman class.
 

OPINION
Memories

Watching the freshmen move in this past weekend remind-.
ed me of last year at this time when I was an arriving fresh-
man, and how confused and unsure I was. It brought back so
many familiar memories.to see mthers and fathers huffing
up and down'the many flights ofstairs with yet another load
of their son’s ofdatightet°S Stiff It surprised me how quickly
the Class of ’90 adapted to college life. Not more than three
hours after getting settled, stereos were blasting, and
frisbee, lacrosse, and football games were in full swing in
both quads. Clusters of freshmen introducing themselves to
one another dotted the campus. It was the typical scene that
happens every September on every campus in the country.

But more than the familiar memories, I was struck by how
much difference a year can make. Last year it was hard to
find a freshman woman who had not been interviewed or
photographed. This year, there were only a few reporters
were sent to do follow up stories on coeducation. But reality is
that coeducation is no longer a big story. In fact many of this
year’s freshmen are unconcerned with W&L’s recent move to
coeducation. One freshman was overheard innocently ask-
ing, ‘What year did Washington and Lee go coed?” The Class
of 90 seems to be more concerned with Washington and Lee’s
academic reputation than the state of coeducation.

I realize that there are a few people who are still skeptical
about the success of coeducation. I would like to share with
these people some of the positive things that I feel have
resulted from or at least coincided with coeducation.

First and most importantly is that the quality of students
has increased. Washington and Lee seems to be getting more
well rounded individuals who have high S.A.T. scores.
Perhaps the one word that best describes the type of student
that chooses W&L is “motivated’’. These students are not
just interested in academics, but also in extracurricular ac-"
tivities. This seems particularly true of the class of ’90.
Statistics of this year’s freshmen class show that 59 students
were president or vice president of their student body or
class, and there were 104 varsity athletic captains, and 47
freshmen were editors of their school newspaper, literary
magazine or yearbook.

But more than anything, I was impressed by the fact that
during this past weekend in the midst of all the emotional tur-
moil that comes from leaving familiar surroundings and
moving out on one’s own, so many freshmen exuded self con-
fidence. Many students were more glad than sad to see their
parents leave so that the freshmen could get on with making
new friends and enjoying college life. Many freshmen I spoke
to had definite ideas about their major and career goals. The
Class of 90 seem to know exactly where they were going and
what they wanted.

Second, I approve wholeheartedly of the decision to recruit
more minority students. I believe that college life is
necessarily separate from real life, in that many day to day
pressures have been removed so that students can concen-
trate better on their studies. However, there is a difference in
living in a world slightly buffered from reality and one that is
pure fantasy. W&L’s campus cantains so few minority
students that is an unreal representation of life. Students
must learn that the world contains more than white angol-
saxon protestants. College years form not just students
minds, but also their morals, and W&L, I would hope, would
encourage students to treat each other with equality and an
absence of prejudice. Equality demands a campus full of
varied people, and therefore coeducation and strong recruit-
ment of minority students is a necessity for the good of the
school and the students.

The attitude that coeducation will cause the demise of the
fraternity system is unfounded in my opinion. In fact, frater-
nities seem as strong as ever. I am pleased that coeducation
and the fraternity system seem to have reached a peaceful
coexistance. W&L women are happy to be as much a part of
the fraternities as possible (I know several women who spend
more time at a particular fraternity house than do several of
its members), but the fraternity scene is not the only choice
for a social life. For W&L men, it remains a strong part of
campus life. :

What I also find encouraging about the Class of ’90 is that
they are from various states and that more than half are
from public schools. What I said about the recruitment of
minority students applies here. Not everyone says “‘y’all”’ in
place of every pronoun, nor is everyone in the highest tax
bracket. I believe that it is imperative that the University
have a diverse group of students, not only so that we learn to
tolerate differences in one another, but also so that we can
understand and appreciate those differences.

It appears that W&L is moving away from it’s repution for

 

being an ‘institution for rich ‘“‘gold ole boys’’. It’s more’

becoming a group of well rounded, diverse people who are
linked by a commitment to academics and for that reason I

am thankful for the changes that have occured since last

September.

Student says you can’t go home again

 

MY VIEW

By Susan Lewis

 

Consider it fair warning,
freshmen: home is not the same
when you go back for your first sum-
mer at the old homestead.

Of course, at the beginning it’s
great to be back. You get to sleep in
your own confortable bed again, see
your favorite cat or dog that’s part of
the family, and-last but not least-see
Mom and Dad and talk everything
over with them. But after a couple
weeks of relaxing, or, most likely
working fairly hard im order to save
some money for the fall, it begins to
dawn on you that things are different
— somehow strange.

Though some people may think so,

‘Huh-what’ syndrome: what’s in a name

 

MY VIEW
By Abb Jones

 

“Now where do you go to school?
William and Mary? Washington Uni-
versity?”

“Where is Washington and Lee?
Washington state?”

“Oh, I’ll bet you just love living in
Washington D.C.”

" ? Oh, Kentucky!”

Sound familiar? Well, rest assured
that everyone who has ever attended
this institution of higher education
has at some point been subject to
what I refer to as the “‘Huh-what”
Syndrome. This inevitable occurence
usually begins during the summer
preceding the freshman year. At first
you're taken completely by surprise
by the fact that these hopeless in-
dividuals don’t know anything about
W&L. I mean, where did they grow

MED

 

 

this strangeness is far more than the
idea that after nine months of being
independent, you’re suddenly thrown
back into a dependent situation.
Granted, this does cause some pro-
blems. It’s a Saturday night in the
middle of June, and after a long week
of work, you head out the front door
for a night out with some high school
buddies. Breezily, you add: ‘“Bye
Mom and Dad; I’m going out!” From
the living room comes a quick reply.
‘Wait a minute! Where are you going
and when will you be back?’’ Stun-
ned, you turn around and stammer:
‘‘What do you mean, ‘what time will I
be back??!” Finally, perhaps, a
compromise is worked out, in which
if you're going te be out extrapr-
dinarily late, you’ll call home. But
still the whole idea rankles you, since
for the last nine months you’ve come
and gone as you pleased.

up, ina cave? Surely they are joking.
No one could not know about W&L,
could they? (Then again, maybe you
should check between their toes for
stalagmite formations. )

So it happens:They ask you the
standard question. ‘‘Where do you go
to school?”’ As you answer them, you
can tell immediately if they are af-
flicted by the Syndrome. They’1I tilt
their puzzled heads to one side, raise
an eyebrow, and mutter something
like, ‘Oh? And where is that?” And
of course, since you’re a W&L gentle-
man (I know I know, but “gentle-
woman” or ‘“‘gentleperson’’ sounds
silly. So sue me.) you politely reply
“Virginia’’ and wish that you posses-
sed a very large stick for the sole pur-
pose of clubbing these clueless
wonders.

But wait. It doesn’t end there,
Many times these unfortunates will

name or location of your college. (Or
worse yet, they’ll ask you to repeat

The night out with your friends is a
lot of fun, but after about a month,
even that becomes kind of old hat,
and you realize that something
strange is even going on between
your friends and you. It’s not that you
all don’t think as much of each other
as you did before, but things have
changed. After a year away at col-
lege, everyone has developed new in-
terests and ideas which often times
clash with friends who were exposed
to differing situations and people.
Even more significant is the amazing
way college leads people to make
friends whom, within a relatively
short amount of time, you feel like
you’ve known all your life. At home
again, it becomes hard not to start a
sentence with, ‘““My friend from col-
lege and I...,” often leading uninten-

tionally to excluding high school
friends.

the’’Huh-what”’ Syndrome has reach-

evacuation procedures so as not to
become contaminated and end up in
Georgetown’s registration line come

I am pleased to announce, how-
ever, that there is one occupation
quite familiar with W&L. Yes, the
law profession. (I’m still convinced
that W&L has turned out more law-

in the nation.) You can go to almost
any attorney in the country and he’ll
not only tell you where W&L is but he
will probably include some brief
history of it as well. (After all,
chances are strong that he attended
W&L at some point in his life, or at
least wishes he did.)

Wilson addresses
freshmen parents

As the members of the class of 1990
were putting the finishing touches on
then dormitory rooms, more than
300 parents of freshman filed into Lee
Chapel to hear President John D.
Wilson and a five-person panel ex-
Plain the traditions and rules of
Washington and Lee during parent’s
orientation Sunday afternoon.

In a 25-minute speech, Wilson told
the crowd of the significance of the
Honor System at W&L, the effect of
Robert E. Lee’s presidency and ex-
plained what the freshmen will en-
counter in their first year.

“They will accept responsibility
and they will accept it quickly,”
Wilson said.

efforts promoting the Horse Center in
Rockbridge County, took part in a
ceremonial noteburning signifying
completion of payments for the site.
The groundbreaking itself occur-
red as Baliles got behind a golden

plow pulled by a pair of Clydesdales
owned by Dick Parker of Cana. Other
festivities included an equestrian
review of all the major horse in-
dustry breeds in Virginia.

The concept for the Horse Center

took shape in the 1970s, and, after
legislation in 1985 actually created
the Center, the General Assembly
first appropriated funds for the
Center in its 1986 Budget. The final
cost is estimated at about $4 million.

Freshmen were introduced to the
Honor System Tuesday afternoon in
Lee Chapel. Among other things,
they were warned against using false
identification.

“Do not use fake IDs,” said
Shayam Menon, Executive Commit-
tee president. ‘‘If it is reported, it will
be investigated as a possible honor
violation.”

Menon said that this was not an en-
dorsement of ABC policies, which the
EC may not necessarily condone.

Even with the warnings that were
being given, both Menon and senior
EC representative Brandt Surgner
reminded the freshmen that ‘the
Honor System is not here to scare
any of you.”

At one point in the orientation,
Menon told the group that if any of
them felt that they could not live with
the Honor System, to leave the
chapel and withdraw from school.

To emphasize the point, Menor
gave the freshmen several silent
moments to consider his statement
before the next speaker was it
troduced.

The freshmen then
separate groups with different EC
members for question and answer
sessions on the Front Lawn.

One question that was asked more ®
than once was, ‘‘What if you walk in-
to a bar and are served without being
carded?”

According to Menon, if a
Washington and Lee student does not
verbally or otherwise deceive so-
meone, then it would not be an honor
violation.

Menon said after the orientation
program was over that ‘‘Each case is
taken on its own merits.”’ Any EC in-
vestigation is of a “‘possible’’ honor
violation.

He said that part of the reason he
brought up the subject of the fake ID
cards was to clarify the matter so all
students would understand how it
would be handled.

sorority committee
is being organized

By SYDNEY MARTHINSON
Staff Reporter

An advising committee to organize
a possible winter rush for sororities
is being organized, according to
Leroy C. “‘Buddy” Atkins, associate
dean of students for Greek affairs
and director of student activities.

If the incoming freshmen women
‘show the same.interest as many of
‘the’other Washington & Lee women
had, Atkins says that it is ‘‘conceiv-
able” that rush would begin in
January.

The committee members will be
Dean Anne Schroer, Dean Atkins, the
chairwoman of the Greek Committee
of the Women’s Forum, Caroline
Boone, female faculty members, and
the women students most interested
in starting sororities. Atkins said that
the committee would establish a
“timetable” to work toward.

Boone, who has been working
closely with the sophomore Elizabeth
Cummins for the past year, reiter-
ated that. She has been researching
over a dozen national sororities and
would like to see the committee limit
this number. Then, the sororities can
be invited to make presentations to
students and the actual sororities
which will be colonized can be decid-
ed upon.

Boone was contacted by several
nationals over the summer, whom

she describes as ‘‘very interested”’ in -
colonizing at Washington and Lee.
Atkins cited the incoming fresh
men, several of the faculty, and some
of the returning female students as
possible obstacles in colonization. H«
thinks that most fraternity members

will not be opposed because national

fraternities have been unhappy in the
past with little sister programs which
have not been successful in integrat-
ing WOMEN.» 5.5.0 Peres CSR

“Whether you agree with it or not,
one of the major things a fraternity
does is greatly increase the chance to
get involved with self-govern
ment...Women deserve the same op-
portunity,” said Atkins.

Winter rush of sororities would
have no effect on future fraternity
rush schedules, according to Atkins,
but he said that hopes the men and
women could work together to form
rush schedules at the same time,
because ‘‘it makes sense to do if that
way.”

“The odds are that we'll have
sororities, but it’s not a given,”
Atkins said.

Boone said that she has received an
extensive amount of information
from different national chapters
which is available for anyone to
peruse if they are interested. She
looks forward to sororities colonizing
and said, “I’ll work as much as
necessary to get it done.”’

Mollenhoff receives award

Clark R. Mollenhoff, professor of journalism at
‘Washington and Lee, has been named Alumnus of the
Year for the Drake University Law School.

_ Mollenhoff will receive his award at a special dinner
‘in November on the Drake campus in Des Moines,
‘Towa.

‘ A 1941 graduate of Webster City Junior College,
‘Mollenhoff received his L.L.B. degree from Drake
( niversity in 1944. He received his J.D. degree from
rake in 1968 and was the recipient of the honorary Litt.

from Drake in 1966.

‘ Anationally-known writer and investigative reporter,
‘Mollenhoff received the Pulitizer for Prize National
Reporting in 1958. He is the recipient of numerous other
awards including the William Allen White Award from

the University of Kansas, the John Peter Zenger Award
from the University of Arizona and the National Head-
liner Award for magazine writing.

Mollenhoff served as special counsel to President
Richard Nixon in 1969. He is the author of many books
and magazine articles, including “Game Plan for
Disaster,” an ombudsman’s report on the Nixon years.
“The Man Who Pardoned Nixon,” the story of the Presi-
dent Gerald Ford's destruction of his own credibility

Mollenhoff joined the faculty at W&L in 1976,

Farrar to work with alumni

The new associate director of the Alumni Association,
James D. Farrar, Jr., said he is glad to be back in Lex-
ington — for the third time.

Farrar, a Lexington native, went to Episcopal High
School and came back to attend Washington and Lee
where he played football and was an All-America
player in lacrosse.

After graduating from W&L in 1974, Farrar returned
to Episcopal where he was the director of admissions.
This summer he was named to replace Leroy C. ‘‘Bud-
dy” Atkins II, who moved to the Dean of Students office.

Farrar described the Alumni Association of the last
several years as “‘aggressive”’ and said that he is look-
ing forward to continuing that style of operation.

He said the Alumni Association will continue to spon-
sor first-week cookouts for freshmen because he wants
the students to feel like ‘‘alumni-in-residence’’ and be
familiar with the Alumni Association.

Starting new alumni chapters and revitalizing dor-
mant chapters are two of Farrar’s goals for this year.

Strong alumni chapters, he said, are ‘‘critical for the
success of the University.”
“Tt is our goal to keep alumni abreast of what’s going
on with Washington and Lee today.”

Alumni staff associate appointed

James Caulley Deringer, a 1986 Washington and Lee
graduate, has been appointed alumni staff associate at
Washington and Lee. Deringer assumed the post on
August 25.

As alumni associate, Deringer will work closely with
Kathekon, the student alumni association, and travel to
alumni chapter meetings and contribute to the W&L
Alumni Magazine.

While a student at W&L, Deringer was a four-year let-
terman on the varsity lacrosse team, a member of the
student recruitment committee, the Student Activities
Board and Phi Kappa Sigma social fraternity. He ma-
jored in journalism.

Deringer graduated from Episcopal High School in
Alexandria, Va.

Akins new head of committee

Robert E. Akins, associate professor of Engineering,
this year replaces Michael A. Cappeto as chairman of
the Alcohol and Health Awareness Committee.

The committee, which is beginning its second year,
coordinates alcohol, drug and other health-related
awareness programs at Washington and Lee. It’s pur-
pose is to establish goals and objectives geared toward
the promotion of self health and total wellness through

the education of the W&L community. The initial goal
will focus on the responsible use of alcohol.

There are three subcommittees which deal with
education, counseling and policy and administration.
Last year the policy-making subcommittee was involv-
ed in the development of the current dorm rules regard-
ing alcohol and drugs. The educational subcommittee
was responsible for originating a shuttle bus service for
Student Activities Pavilion concerts to discourage
students driving while intoxicated. This year the corm-
mittee plans to work with the fraternities and other
campus organizations to clarify an alcohol policy reg
ding public functions, and develop a peer counse
program to include the entire university community
There will also be an observation of the National
Alcohol Awareness week Oct. 20-26 and other educa
tional programs throughout the year.

Students interested in joining one of these subcon
mittees should see Carol Calkins at ext. 8590 or Room
104 in the University Center.

Memories

Watching the freshmen move in this past weekend remind-
ed me of last year at this time when I was an arriving fresh-
man, and how confused and unsure I was. It brought back so
many familiar memories.to see mothers and fathers huffing
up and down the many flights of-stairs with yet another load
of their son’s ofdaaghters Stiff! It surprised me how quickly
the Class of ’90 adapted to college life. Not more than three
hours after getting settled, stereos were blasting, and
frisbee, lacrosse, and football games were in full swing in
both quads. Clusters of freshmen introducing themselves to
one another dotted the campus. It was the typical scene that
happens every September on every campus in the country.

But more than the familiar memories, I was struck by how
much difference a year can make. Last year it was hard to
find a freshman woman who had not been interviewed or
photographed. This year, there were only a few reporters
were sent to do follow up stories on coeducation. But reality is
that coeducation is no longer a big story. In fact many of this
year’s freshmen are unconcerned with W&L’s recent move to
coeducation. One freshman was overheard innocently ask-
ing, ‘‘What year did Washington and Lee go coed?” The Class
of 90 seems to be more concerned with Washington and Lee’s
academic reputation than the state of coeducation.

I realize that there are a few people who are still skeptical
about the success of coeducation. I would like to share with
these people some of the positive things that I feel have
resulted from or at least coincided with coeducation.

First and most importantly is that the quality of students
has increased. Washington and Lee seems to be getting more
well rounded individuals who have high S.A.T. scores.
Perhaps the one word that best describes the type of student
that chooses W&L is “‘motivated’’. These students are not
just interested in academics, but also in extracurricular ac-
tivities. This seems particularly true of the class of ’90.
Statistics of this year’s freshmen class show that 59 students
were president or vice president of their student body or
class, and there were 104 varsity athletic captains, and 47
freshmen were editors of their school newspaper, literary
magazine or yearbook.

But more than anything, I was impressed by the fact that
during this past weekend in the midst of all the emotional tur-
moil that comes from leaving familiar surroundings and
moving out on one’s own, so many freshmen exuded self con-
fidence. Many students were more glad than sad to see their:
parents leave so that the freshmen could get on with making
new friends and enjoying college life. Many freshmen I spoke
to had definite ideas about their major and career goals. The
Class of ’90 seem to know exactly where they were going and
what they wanted.

Second, I approve wholeheartedly of the decision to recruit
more minority students. I believe that college life is
necessarily separate from real life, in that many day to day
pressures have been removed so that students can concen-
trate better on their studies. However, there is a difference in
living in a world slightly buffered from reality and one that is
pure fantasy. W&L’s campus centains so few minority
students that is an unreal representation of life. Students
must learn that the world contains more than white angol-
saxon protestants. College years form not just students
minds, but also their morals, and W&L, I would hope, would
encourage students to treat each other with equality and an
absence of prejudice. Equality demands a campus full of
varied people, and therefore coeducation and strong recruit-
ment of minority students is a necessity for the good of the
school and the students.

The attitude that coeducation will cause the demise of the
fraternity system is unfounded in my opinion. In fact, frater-
nities seem as strong as ever. I am pleased that coeducation
and the fraternity system seem to have reached a peaceful
coexistance. W&L women are happy to be as much a part of
the fraternities as possible (I know several women who spend
more time at a particular fraternity house than do several of
its members), but the fraternity scene is not the only choice
for a social life. For W&L men, it remains a strong part of
campus life. :

What I also find encouraging about the Class of 90 is that
they are from various states and that more than half are
from public schools. What I said about the recruitment of
minority students applies here. Not everyone says “‘y’all” in
place of every pronoun, nor is everyone in the highest tax
bracket. I believe that it is imperative that the University
have a diverse group of students, not only so that we learn to
tolerate differences in one another, but also so that we can
understand and appreciate those differences.

It appears that W&L is moving away from it’s repution for
being an institution for rich ‘“‘gold ole boys’. It’s more
becoming a group of well rounded, diverse people who are
linked by a commitment to academics and for that reason I
am thankful for the changes that have occured since last
September.

Student says you can’t go home again

 

MY VIEW

By Susan Lewis

 

Consider it fair warning,
freshmen: home is not the same
when you go back for your first sum-
mer at the old homestead.

Of course, at the beginning it’s
great to be back. You get to sleep in
your own confortable bed again, see
your favorite cat or dog that’s part of
the family, and-last but not least-see
Mom and Dad and talk everything
over with them. But after a couple
weeks of relaxing, or most likely
working fairly hard in order to save
some money for the fall, it begins to
dawn on you that things are different
— somehow strange.

Though some people may think so,

‘Huh-what’ syndrome: what’s in a name?

 

MY VIEW
By Abb Jones

 

“Now where do you go to school?
William and Mary? Washington Uni-
versity?”

“Where is Washington and Lee?
Washington state?”

“Oh, I'll bet you just love living in
Washington D.C.”

“Lexington? Oh, Kentucky!”

Sound familiar? Well, rest assured
that everyone who has ever attended
this institution of higher education
has at some point been subject to
what I refer to as the ‘‘Huh-what”
Syndrome. This inevitable occurence
usually begins during the summer
preceding the freshman year. At first
you're taken completely by surprise
by the fact that these hopeless in-
dividuals don’t know anything about

this strangeness is far more than the
idea that after nine months of being
independent, you’re suddenly thrown
back into a dependent situation.
Granted, this does cause some pro-
blems. It’s a Saturday night in the
middle of June, and after a long week
of work, you head out the front door
for a night out with some high school
buddies. Breezily, you add: ‘Bye
Mom and Dad; I’m going out!”’ From
the living room comes a quick reply.
“Wait a minute! Where are you going
and when will you be back?” Stun-
ned, you turn around and stammer:
“What do you mean, ‘what time will I
be back??!” Finally, perhaps, a
compromise is worked out, in which
if you're going te be out extragr-
dinarily late, you’ll call home. But
still the whole idea rankles you, since
for the last nine months you’ve come
and gone as you pleased.

up, in a cave? Surely they are joking.
No one could not know about W&L,
could they? (Then again, maybe you
should check between their toes for
stalagmite formations.)

So it happens.They ask you the
standard question. ‘‘Where do you go
to school?”’ As you answer them, you
can tell immediately if they are af-
flicted by the Syndrome. They’ll tilt
their puzzled heads to one side, raise
an eyebrow, and mutter something
like, ‘‘Oh? And where is that?’’ And
of course, since you’re a W&L gentle-
man (I know I know, but ‘‘gentle-
woman” or “‘gentleperson’”’ sounds
silly. So sue me.) you politely reply
“Virginia” and wish that you posses-
sed a very large stick for the sole pur-
pose of clubbing these clueless
wonders.

The night out with your friends is a
lot of fun, but after about a month,
even that becomes kind of old hat,
and you realize that something
strange is even going on between
your friends and you. It’s not that you
all don’t think as much of each other
as you did before, but things have
changed. After a year away at col-
lege, everyone has developed new in-
terests and ideas which often times
clash with friends who were exposed
to differing situations and people.
Even more significant is the amazing
way college leads people to make
friends whom, within a relatively
short amount of time, you feel like
you’ve known all your life. At home
again, it becomes hard not to start a
sentence with, ‘‘My friend from col-
lege and I...,”’ often leading uninten-

tionally to excluding high school

I am pleased to announce, how-

quite familiar with W&L. Yes, the
law profession. (I’m still convinced
that W&L has turned out more law-

any attorney in the country and he’ll
not only tell you where W&L is but he
will probably include some brief
history of it as well. (After all,

W&L at some point in his life, or at
least wishes he did.)

Wilson addresses
freshmen parents

 

By JASON LISI
Editor

 

As the members of the class of 1990
were putting the finishing touches on
then dormitory rooms, more than
300 parents of freshman filed into Lee
Chapel to hear President John D.
Wilson and a five-person panel ex-
plain the traditions and rules of
Washington and Lee during parent’s
orientation Sunday afternoon.

In a 25-minute speech, Wilson told
the crowd of the significance of the
Honor System at W&L, the effect of
Robert E. Lee’s presidency and ex-
plained what the freshmen will en-
counter in their first year.

“They will accept responsibility
and they will accept it quickly,”
Wilson said.

He said gathering for parents
orientation in Lee Chapel was ap-
propriate, calling the building built
during Lee’s presidency ‘“‘the spiri-
tual heart of Washington and Lee.”
He stressed, however, that the chapel
was not the only, or even most impor-
tant, contribution Lee made during
his: 1865-1870 term. ‘‘The honor, the
magnanimity, the sense of noblesse
oblige, the reaching out in compas-
sion to others, the insistance upon
understanding another point of view
— all of these things are part of his
great gift,’’ he said.

realize their decisions will affect
théir own lives; there is no one to

On August 13, Virginia Governor
Gerald L. Baliles presided over the
groundbreaking for the Virginia
Horse Center.

Though the Horse Center will not
officially open until late in 1987 or
early 1988, the ceremonies in August
meant a great deal to the Lexington-
Rockbridge area.

H. E. “Buddy” Derrick of Lex-
ington, who was instrumental in
gaining both local and state support
for the project, served as master of
ceremonies at the groundbreaking
and said the combined governmental
and private efforts to bring the Horse
Center to the Rockbridge County was
“in the true Jeffersonian partnership
tradition.”

fast in time for classes, he said.

Wilson said parents should let their
children ‘‘find their own way” to
areas of study and career goals.

Wilson was introduced by Presi-
dent of the Student Body Shayam
Menon.

Following Wilsons’ speech was a
panel discussion regarding the pro-
blems freshmen may face during the
first few terms.

The panel was composed of Dean of
Students Lewis G. John, Dean of
Freshmen H. Robert Huntley, Assoc-
iate Dean of Students Anne C. P.
Schroer, and Professor of Physics H.
Thomas Williams, Jr.

Huntley told the parents of the role
of dormitory counselors in the lives
of freshmen. He said freshmen
should go to their dormitory
counselors first with problems and
advised parents to call the counselors
if problems arise at home which may
affect the freshmen at school.

Dean John explained fraternity

Perhaps a sign of what the
Horse Center could mean to the
Rockbridge County area is the ar-
rival of a new shop in Lexington:
The Hunter and Huntress at 18
East Nelson St.

Owned and operated by Dr.and
Mrs. Brent D. Brandon of Natural

 

Bridge, this shop sells English and
Western riding and tack equip-
ment, as well as hunting, hobby
and gift items.

The Brandons own the Rock-
bridge Cleveland Bay Stud Farm
in Natural Bridge, where Blake
Brandon raises Cleveland Bay
horses, a breed originally from
the Vale of Cleveland, England,
and known for its great size,
strength, jumping ability and
balance.

idea for their store, according to
Judy Turcott, an employee who
has worked with the Brandons
since before the Hunter and Hun-

Business has steadily increased
since the store opened, and now
that students are arriving back in
the area, including students from
surrounding colleges with riding

even more rapidly, Turcott said.

Rockbridge County, took part in a
ceremonial noteburning signifying
completion of payments for the site.
The groundbreaking itself occur-
red as Baliles got behind a golden

plow pulled by a pair of Clydesdales
owned by Dick Parker of Cana. Other
festivities included an equestrian
review of all the major horse in-

The concept for the Horse Center

took shape in the 1970s, and, after
legislation in 1985 actually created
the Center, the General Assembly
first appropriated funds for the
Center in its 1986 Budget. The final
cost is estimated at about $4 million.

Freshmen were introduced to the
Honor System Tuesday afternoon in
Lee Chapel. Among other things,
they were warned against using false
identification.

“Do not use fake IDs,” said
Shayam Menon, Executive Commit-
tee president. “‘If it is reported, it will
be investigated as a possible honor
violation.”

Menon said that this was not an en-
dorsement of ABC policies, which the
EC may not necessarily condone.

Even with the warnings that were
being given, both Menon and senior
EC representative Brandt Surgner
reminded the freshmen that ‘the
Honor System is not here to scare
any of you.”

At one point in the orientation,

sorority committee
is being organized

By SYDNEY MARTHINSON
Staff Reporter

 

An advising committee to organize
a possible winter rush for sororities
is being organized, according to
Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy”’ Atkins, associate
dean of students for Greek affairs
and director of student activities.

If the incoming freshmen women
show the same interest as many of

Y theother Washington & Lee women

had, Atkins says that it is ‘“‘conceiv-
able” that rush would begin in
January.

The committee members will be
Dean Anne Schroer, Dean Atkins, the
chairwoman of the Greek Committee
of the Women’s Forum, Caroline
Boone, female faculty members, and
the women students most interested
in starting sororities. Atkins said that
the committee would establish a
“timetable”’ to work toward.

Boone, who has been working
closely with the sophomore Elizabeth
Cummins for the past year, reiter-
ated that. She has been researching
over a dozen national sororities and
would like to see the committee limit

this number. Then, the sororities can
be invited to make presentations to
students and the actual sororities
which will be colonized can be decid-
ed upon.

Boone was contacted by several
nationals over the summer, whom

she describes as ‘‘very interesie:
colonizing at Washington and L«

Atkins cited the incoming |
men, several of the faculty, and
of the returning female students a:

thinks that most fraternity member
will not be opposed because nationa!
fraternities have been unhappy in the
past with little sister programs which
have not been successful in integral
ing women.

“Whether you agree with it or not
one of the major things a fraternil
does is greatly increase the chance |

Winter rush of sororities would
have no effect on future frate

but he said that hopes ¢]
women could work togeth:

because ‘‘it makes sense to di
way.”

“The odds are that we'll have
sororities, but it’s not a give:
Atkins said.

Boone said that she has received an
extensive amount of information
from different national chapters
which is available for anyone to
peruse if they are interested. She
looks forward to sororities colonizing
and said, “I'll work as much as
necessary to get it done.”

 

‘Northen Auditorium namesake, benefactress dies at 94

 

Staff Reports

 

‘Mary Modédy Northen, a major contributor to
Washington and Lee died August 26, in Galveston, Tex-
as, after a long illness. She was 94.
| Her gifts to W&L amount to more than $500,000, in-
¢luding $350,000 which she donated for the construction
of the undergraduate library. The Northen Auditorium
in the library is named in her honor. She also gave dona-
tions to develop the library’s audio-visual center.

; Mrs. Northen had given VMI, her father’s alma
inater, over $3 million. The William L. Moody, Jr., Hall
was named after her father.

In 1954, after her father’s death, Mrs. Northen was
left with control of over 52 major corporations in her
family’s financial empire. The corporations varied
from banking to cotton.

Mollenhoff receives award

Clark R. Mollenhoff, professor of journalism at
Washington and Lee, has been named Alumnus of the
Year for the Drake University Law School.

Mollenhoff will receive his award at a special dinner
in November on the Drake campus in Des Moines,
Iowa.

A 1941 graduate of Webster City Junior College,
Mollenhoff received his L.L.B. degree from Drake

niversity in 1944. He received his J.D. degree from
rake in 1968 and was the recipient of the honorary Litt.

from Drake in 1966.

A nationally-known writer and investigative reporter,
Mollenhoff received the Pulitizer for Prize National
Reporting in 1958. He is the recipient of numerous other
awards including the William Allen White Award from

the University of Kansas, the John Peter Zenger Award
from the University of Arizona and the National Head-
liner Award for magazine writing.

Mollenhoff served as special counsel to President
Richard Nixon in 1969. He is the author of many books
and magazine articles, including “Game Plan for
Disaster,” an ombudsman’s report on the Nixon years.
“The Man Who Pardoned Nixon,”’ the story of the Presi-
dent Gerald Ford’s destruction of his own credibility
House,”’ a textbook on investigative reporting.

Mollenhoff joined the faculty at W&L in 1976.

Farrar to work with alumni

The new associate director of the Alumni Association,
James D. Farrar, Jr., said he is glad to be back in Lex-
ington — for the third time.

Farrar, a Lexington native, went to Episcopal High
School and came back to attend Washington and Lee
where he played football and was an All-America
player in lacrosse.

After graduating from W&L in 1974, Farrar returned
to Episcopal where he was the director of admissions.
This summer he was named to replace Leroy C. ‘‘Bud-
dy” Atkins IT, who moved to the Dean of Students office.

Farrar described the Alumni Association of the last
several years as ‘‘aggressive’’ and said that he is look-
ing forward to continuing that style of operation.

He said the Alumni Association will continue to spon-
sor first-week cookouts for freshmen because he wants
the students to feel like ‘‘alumni-in-residence’’ and be
familiar with the Alumni Association.

Starting new alumni chapters and revitalizing dor-
mant chapters are two of Farrar’s goals for this year.

Strong alumni chapters, he said, are ‘‘critical for the
success of the University.”’
“Tt is our goal to keep alumni abreast of what’s going
on with Washington and Lee today.”
—Mathew Horridge

Alumni staff associate appointed

James Caulley Deringer, a 1986 Washington and Lee
graduate, has been appointed alumni staff associate at
Washington and Lee. Deringer assumed the post on
August 25.

As alumni associate, Deringer will work closely with
Kathekon, the student alumni association, and travel to
alumni chapter meetings and contribute to the W&L
Alumni Magazine.

While a student at W&L, Deringer was a four-year let-
terman on the varsity lacrosse team, a member of the
student recruitment committee, the Student Activities
Board and Phi Kappa Sigma social fraternity. He ma-
jored in journalism.

Deringer graduated from Episcopal High School in
Alexandria, Va.

Akins new head of committee

Robert E. Akins, associate professor of Engineering,
this year replaces Michael A. Cappeto as chairman of
the Alcohol and Health Awareness Committee.

The committee, which is beginning its second year,
coordinates alcohol, drug and other health-related
awareness programs at Washington and Lee. It’s pur-
pose is to establish goals and objectives geared toward
the promotion of self health and total wellness through

the education of the W&L community. The initial goal
will focus on the responsible use of alcohol.

There are three subcommittees which deal with
education, counseling and policy and administration
Last year the policy-making subcommittee was involv
ed in the development of the current dorm rules regard
ing alcohol and drugs. The educational subcommittee
was responsible for originating a shuttle bus ser

Frats get cleaned

By CHARLES T. GAY
Staff Reporter

 

Most of the fraternities at
Washington and Lee have spent this
past week readying themselves and
their houses for Rush, which official-
ly begins after the first week of
classes with Open House registra-
tion. However, unofficial Rush will
begin with the end of no-contact
tomorrow at noon.

Members of Sigma Chi described
their work in terms of ‘painting,
scraping, and partying,”’ adding that
the house is ‘‘psyched, definitely,”
for Rush.

John Lawson, of Sigma Nu, said
that there was a “vast improvement
in the condition of our house physical-
ly.’ Lawson said his fraternity
“couldn't be in a better frame of
mind for Rush.”’

Fraternities have been watching to
see if any significant changes in the
Rush program will be brought about
by the new Associate Dean of Stu-
dents, Leroy C. “Buddy” Atkins,
whose job is to work with the frater-
nities.

Atkins said his job is to serve
primarily as an administrative con-
tact for fraternities. I’m here to help
the houses improve themselves, and
adapt to change, such as with the
ABC laws,”’ Atkins said.

“The houses should be regulating
themselves, “‘ he said. “The IFC
must do its job, and the fraternities
must work together in order to keep
the Greek movement strong.”

Dean Atkins, and 1968 W&L
graduate, served as Associate Alum-
ni Director before moving to his pre-
sent position, which replaces Dan N.
Murphy, now Associate Director of
Admissions.

Police are optimistic Read

 

By MATHEW HORRIDGE
Staff Reporter

 

The Lexington police force is look-
ing forward to a year of good rela-
tions with Washington and Lee stu-
dents, according to acting police
chief Lt. Bruce M. Beard.

Chief of Police L.O. Sutton has
spent the summer at a police training
program at the FBI complex in
Quantico and will probably return to
work Monday.

Beard said he hopes W&L students
and police officers can work with, not
against, each other and that students
feel free to call the police if some-
thing suspicious is happening.

The Lexington City Council adopt-
ed an addition to its parking regu-
lations July 10, which raises the over-
time penalty in a two-hour street
zone to $5. The overtime penalty for a
public parking lot is $2.

In addition, the new regulation
states that any marked parking

The ’86 editors said they started
from “‘scratch’’ with a large number
of freshmen on the staff.

Although there may be problems in
the near future for the ’87 Calyx, no
problems are foreseen in handing out
the new Calyx to students.

Nusbaum called the '86 Calyx “‘an

space, ‘unless otherwise specified by
signs, shall be limited to two hours
per space.”’

Charges lodged last spring against
sophomore Steve Sadler, of Easton,
Md., were dropped over the summer,
according to Lexington Clerk of
Court Juanita Rice. Sadler had been
charged with assault and battery and
trespassing after and incident at 511
S. Main Street in late May.

police to be related arrested the per-

noted that no similar forgery cases

Police have no suspects or witnesses

‘We wanted to do something a lit-
tle different,’ Francis said, “‘maybe
a little less traditional...still the same
idea, updated.”

One of the ways the editors said
they tried to be different was in their
treatment of coeducation.

“I don’t think we tried to push
coeducation,” Francis said. He
believes that that new Calyx makes
Washington and Lee look like a
“typical” coed school.

Eight months later, the committee
filed a report with the state bar ac-
cusing Read of making uninvited sex-
ual advances on female clients, The
committee also alleged that Read
had betrayed client. confidences, con-
ducted himself improperly during
the special grand jury investigation,
asked a teen witness there about her
sexual activities, leaked secret
special grand jury information to
police and told a lawyer that he could
embarrass prominent citizens with
the drug probe even if he couldn’t win
convictions.

The state bar also investigated
reports that Read had withheld infor-
mation from defense attorneys at the
trial of an alleged arsonist in the 1984
Phi Gamma Delta fraternity fire.
During W&L’s spring vacation in
1984, W&L sophomore Thomas John
Fellin, 19, of Weston, Pa., was killed
when an early-morning fire swept
through the Fiji house on Preston
Street. An outstanding student and
varsity baseball player, Fellin was
president of the fraternity and had
been asleep on the second floor when
the fire broke out.

Scot Tanner Mesner, then 19, was
arrested and charged with arson and
murder. The son of a Hollins College
reference librarian and history in-
structor, Mesner allegedly started
the blaze because he wanted revenge
after a former girlfriend of his from

Hollins began dating a Fiji at W&L.

The case was dismissed in Decem-
ber 1984 by County Circuit Judge
George E. Honts III, who said that
Read and investigators had violated
Mesner’s due process rights.

A state bar committee privately
reprimanded Read for his handling
of the Mesner case. Read has appeal-
ed that reprimand. Although most of
the other accusations against Read
apparently were dropped, the bar
committee did certify the sexual
misconduct charges to its statewide
disciplinary board.

Read had his choice between a
private board hearing and a public
hearing before a three-judge panel.
He chose the public hearing, which.
originally was scheduled for April. It
was postponed until July because
Spivey was out of the county on a
three-month sabbatical.

Assistant Commonwealth’s At-
torney Richard J. Cabaniss was nam-
ed substitute commonwealth’s at-
torney following Read’s resignation.
Cabaniss drew local attention in
August when he requested that ques-
tions from the editor of the Rock-
bridge Weekly newspaper be in writ-
ing, and then responded by quoting
Scriptures.

In August, Eric Lee Sisler was ap-
pointed to fill out Read’s term, which
would have expired Dec. 31, 1987.
Sisler, 42, received both his bache-
lor’s degree and his law degree from
W&L. He was commonwealth’s attor-
ney from 1971 to 1975, when he was
defeated by Read.

The next election for common-
wealth’s attorney will be in Novem-
ber 1987.

Returnees key to
successful season

By MIKE SHADY
Staff Reporter

 

With an air of great expectation,
‘the Washington and Lee football
‘tgam concluded its final week of
preparation for this Saturday’s
opener against Emory and Henry on
‘Wilson Field.

‘Coming off a 7-2 record (its sixth
.cpnsecutive winning season) and a
share of the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference title, the Generals have
12 returning starters, the key one be-
ing senior tailback Kevin Weaver.
Weaver is fresh off an all-world year
in which he broke school records for
touchdowns, points, yardage and
points per game in addition to being
named ODAC player-of-the-year.

Veaver is a crucial part of the
G  ral’s offense, but head coach

#a / Fallon indicated that the play
calling would not be ‘Weaver left, —
Weaver right.’

“We feel that with the success of
Weaver, teams will be loading up
with eight-man fronts in order to stop
our ground game,” said Fallon,
who is now in his ninth year at W&L.

‘We have to mix it up on offense and
ave success passing so as to create

“nice blend. That’s what helped

feaver last year; our ability to pass

ie ball.”

‘Manning the helm of the air attack

ugh Finkelstein) due to graduation,
jt returning is an experienced pass
itecher in senior split end Randy
fown. The slotback position will be
fled by senior Paul Youngman
hile the tight end job will go to
inior John MacDonald. The offen-
ve line returns four of last year’s
ye starters, with All-conference

dary, losing all four of its starters to
graduation. Juniors Chris Jerussi
and Jeff Harwood have much needed
game experience at the corners, but
the safeties are somewhat lacking in
that department.

“We think they [senior Joe Krastel
and junior Mark Oluvic] will work
out, but only time will tell on those
kids,” said Coach Fallon. ‘Their
speed is as fast if not faster than last
year’s players.”

The Generals were dealt a severe
blow during the preseason when
returning linebacker and placekick-
er, senior B.J. Sturgill suffered a
broken bone in his left leg and liga-
ment damage of the left ankle during
a routine drill.

Filling his place at linebacker will
be freshman Mike Pack who will
team with sophomore Tom Skeen and
senior Bob Berlin to produce, says
Fallon, ‘‘a pretty good trio’ at the
linebacking corps.

Up front on the defensive line, W&L
will go with proven veterans in senior
Jim Murphy and juniors Jay
Gorlowski and J.P. Johnston.

“I can’t make a prediction about
the outcome of the season,’ says
coach Fallon. ‘‘Each game will be a
dog fight. I know our opponents will
be ready and hungry to beat us, so we
must be physically, emotionally and
mentally prepared.”’

these two have met with E&H holding
a 9-6 advantage... E&H won last

halfback Sandy Rogers on offense
and he will draw an inevitable com-
parison to Weaver... Says Fallon of

Eleventh year soccer coach Rolf
Piranian is a constant. He has been
named Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference coach-of-the-year three
times and in the past six years he has
guided his teams to a 41-25-4 mark.
This year’s version of the soccer
team is much less stable.

Many players were lost from last
season’s 6-6 squad, putting this
year’s team in the always awkward
position of having to play relatively
inexperienced players in key posi-
tions.

Piranian said that “this team will
be a different team from last
year’s,” but declined to name which

there was an intrasquad contest com-
ing up this Saturday and that final
roster decisions would be made
following that game. ‘We want to
keep the pressure on,”’ said Piranian.

Although he wouldn’t specify, Pira-
nian also said that there would be
freshmen playing important roles on
this team. “There are some fresh-
men who are impact players,” said
Piranian. But he repeated that no
final decisions will be made until
after that intrasquad game.

Aside from personnel decisions,
Piranian seems to have already set
the tempo for the year. ‘‘We’re going
to play a wide open game,” said Pira-
nian, ‘‘end to end soccer. There will
be defenders playing offense and vice
versa.”

The Washington and Lee men’s
cross country team, coming off
records of 14-0 in 1984 and 8-4 in 1985,
look strong once again for '86. The
team lost Eddie Gandry, one of its
top runners from last year but still
retains Scott Rippeon, Ash Andrew,
Captain Ted Myers, and Richard
Moore to lead the squad.

‘continuing with the arrival of the
freshmen on the 3ist, the Water Polo
team has been working from dawn to
dusk in order to be ready for their fall
season.

The General’s workouts are not on-
ly taxing physically but also mental-
ly. Rigorous daily conditioning in the
pool helped the team prepare for an

Even with this kind of potential,
head coach Dick Miller still hesitates
to make any types of predictions.
When asked about his goals for this
year’s team he replied, ‘You always
look to go to nationals but you've got
to take it one weekend at a time.”’

Rippeon, the team’s top runner
from last year, looks once again to be
the General’s number one harrier.

Mountain.

Beginning at the edge of Buena
Vista, the team ran on Route 60 to the
Skyline Drive, a total distance of 3.9
miles; all of it uphill.

Head coach Page Remillard ex-
plained this odd training method in
three parts. First, since the athletes
are such proficient swimmers, they
are forced to work harder by doing
something at which they are less
adept-running. Second it toughens
the team mentally; and third, it gives
the players a break from the daily
routine of swimming.

The General face their first test
this weekend as they will be hosting
the Fall Classic Tournament. The
Classic features eight teams —

however, that the fate of the team
can’t rest on one person. “I don’t set

Coach Miller also emphasized the im-

The women’s cross country team is
looking to build and improve after a

W&L ‘‘A” squad enters the tourna-
ment as the number one seed.

The Fall Classic features two days
of preliminaries on Friday and Satur-
day, followed by the two final games
on Sunday morning, with the cham-
pionship at 12:15. Remillard says
that he is optimistic that W&L will be
in the final, possibly, he thought,
against Johns-Hopkins.

This year the Generals hope to
reverse seven years of ‘“‘tradition’’
and. for the first time, bring home
the coveted Fall Classic trophy.
Remillard said that he would like
W&L to win the tournament because
the champions are traditionally one
of the strongest teams in the East.

‘We have a good team nucleus,”’
said Remillard, ‘‘and an awful lot of

team potential.” He continued, ‘Last

year was a building year, this year
can’t be.”’

Miller, also the head coach of the
women’s team, says that ‘‘it takes a
little time to build a women’s team,
but we’ve got the numbers now.”’

However, the women’s team has
lost its captain and top runner from
last year, Carolyn Arbogast, to a
knee injury. She is not expected to

Baffling cover art tonew R.E.M. Lp.

R.E.M.’s rich pageant

 

By MARK TRAINER
Music Critic

 

The beginning of a Washington and
Lee school year invariably brings
with it those few records that will be
played repeatedly through every
fraternity tape deck, three-fourths of
the car stereos on campus, and about
half the speakers in the quad. For the
past three years, the summer R.E.M.
reJeases have been shoe-ins for the
collegiate top-of-the-pops. Their most
recent effort, “Lifes Rich Pageant,”
is definitely the most accessible and
arguably the best music R.E.M. has
produced to date.

Many people, like myself, have
been watching nervously as R.E.M.
makes the difficult transition from
underground heroes to something a
cut above the mainstream. What is
remarkable is how well they have
navigated this dangerous route. As
they’ve progressed from ‘Chronic
Town’ to ‘Lifes Rich Pageant,” they

   

have stayed true to the elements ot
their music that brought them
critical acclaim; at the same time,
they’ve shown a willingness to
develop and experiment.

If, on their fourth full-length
album, Michael Stipe had still been
mumbling incoherently, the whole
act would be a little redundant.
Rather, we can now understand
every word. As well, the laid-back,
neo-folk image is left behind — drop
the needle on the album’s opener, the
startingly good and kinetic “Begin
the Begin,’’ for instance. Stipes’
vocals and Peter Buck’s guitar have
never been better. And the lyrics,
now crystal clear, do not disappoint
(although I’m sure phrases like
“Miles Standish proud”’ and ‘‘Martin
Luther’s sin” evoke much more for
Michael Stipe than they might for the
average listener).

However, there is still plenty of the
old R.E.M. on “Lifes Rich Pageant.”
The cover art will leave even the
most psychedelic mind saying,
“What?”’ Stipe still stretches short

Duo makes record - sort of

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Enter tainment Editor

 

When Heinsohn & Day, an acoustic
duo made up of Washington & Lee
alumni, decided to make a record,
they soon found out that it was not go-
ing to be as easy as they had initially
planned. Now, making a cassette
tape was no problem: It was putting

warmth, competent musicianship
and warm emotional impact. For
Heinsohn & Day, this record has been
more than a personal triumph: It has
proven to a great many people that
this is a serious musical endeavor.

‘We've had great response,’ Vay
said. ‘‘This is from both musical and
non-musical people. They are sur-
prised by how professional it

measures. (What were once ‘‘Ko-hou-
tek”’ and ‘‘I’m s-0-0-0-r-r-y’’ are now
““Cuy-a-hoo-ga”’ and ‘“‘Hy-eee-na.”’)
And Peter Buck thankfully prefers a
ringing guitar chord to rumbling lead
work.

Among the album’s highlights are
“Fall On Me’”’ (the closest thing to a
single on the record) with its plea-
sant acoustic feel; “Cuyahoga,” a
soaring pastoral plea for a mythica)
and ideal civilization; and ‘Swan
Swan H,” a mystical fable song in
which Stipe impressively pulls off the
line “‘What noisy cats are we”
without cracking a smile. Also wor-
thy of note are “Underneath the
Bunker,’’ an amusing piece of cheesy
cinema music and a Who-like cover
of the Champs’ “Superman” with
Bill Berry premiering on lead vocal.

Perhaps the most enjoyable thing

about “‘Lifes Rich Pageant”’ is how it
proves that a group that many
thought would run out of ideas early
in the game is still only discovering
the power of its own voice.

the thing on vinyl that was causing
all the trouble.

“There are all sorts of legal pro-

said. “You have too contend with
government regulations and copy-
write laws...”

“Basically, you have to join this °"®
union,” Roger Day said. “You have _“‘It’s important that people under-

The production is crisp and
straightforward, the performances
are tight and powerful. It is, accord-
ing to Heinsohn, the closest thing to a
live record without actually being

 

 

ly,’’ Heinsonn said.

For instance, Day admitted that
his song ‘Everybody Sing” was in-
spired by a particularly exciting and
rewarding performance at the Sub-
way. The song, however, stands on
its own without that personal infor-
mation. Hum along and you'll see
what I mean.

Heinsohn’s ‘‘Telephone Song
(Please Don’t Go)”’ gains much of its
emotional power from the convictidn
and understanding he brings to the
subject of a long-distance relationsip.
Anyone who has ever suffered
through one of those can certainly
sympathize with the song’s forlorn
longing.

And who cannot sympathize with
Heinsohn’s grand social commen-
tary, ‘Leave Your Mudpack On
Tonight?’ Personally, I guess I say
this phrase every, oh, three or four
days. At least.

The record can be purchased either
through a mail order or directly from
the band itself. For those bargain
shoppers who insist on “‘trying before
buying,’’ Heinsohn & Day will be per-
forming at the Subway tonight and at
Randolph-Macon Women’s College
this Sunday. And remember Roger
Day’s advice: Everybody Sing!

holding information from the

defense.
Under the law, a prosecutor is re-

who originally had identified Mesner
as one of the people watching the
blaze later changed their minds, and
Read did not tell this to Mesner’s at-

torneys.

A state bar district committee
gave Read a private reprimand — its
mildest disciplinary action for his
handling of the Mesner case, said
Michael L. Rigsby, counsel for the
state bar.

Read was given 10 days to appeal
the reprimand. If he hadn’t done so,
the case would not have gone any fur-
ther, said Rigsby, who added that he
had never before seen an appeal of a
reprimand lead to disbarment.

The serious consequences of a
reprimand are that it becomes more
difficult to get malpractice insurance
and that it could be used against an
attorney in a future disciplinary
case, Rigsby said.

Read appealed that reprimand to
the state bar’s disciplinary board, a
12-lawyer panel appointed by the
chief justice of the state Supreme
Court, Rigsby said. The board held a
hearing on July 24 and signed Read’s
disbarment order last Thursday, the
same day Read’s sexual misconduct
hearing resumed in the Rockbridge
County Courthouse. Rigsby said he
showed the order to Read’s attorney,
Joseph M. Spivey III of Richmond, on
Friday.

¢'| ‘Extravagant’ number of

freshmen taken to hospital

 

By SEAN BUGG
Editor

 

A number of Washington and Lee
freshmen were taken to the Stone-
wall Jackson Hospital this past
weekend for alcohol poisoning and
other alcohol related incidents.

According to Associate Dean of
Students Leroy C. ‘“‘Buddy’”’ Atkins,
at least 3 freshmen were taken to the
hospital emergency room Friday
night, along with 3 upperclassmen.
One freshman was taken there Satur-
day night.

Head dormitory counselor Jeff
Mandak said that he knew of three
freshmen who were treated at the
hospital Friday night, although only
two were there for alcohol poisoning.
The third, which was probably
alcohol related, had punched through
a window and cut his hand.

According to Mandak one of the
freshmen experienced stomach
bleeding and other symptoms that re-
quired an overnight stay at the
hospital. The others were treated and
released to the Washington and Lee
infirmary.

Saturday night a student was in-
jured at the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
fraternity house, and was taken by
ambulance to the hospital.

Henry Hawthorne, a freshman

SAE house after making the rounds
at a number of other fraternity par-
ties. Hawthorne said that he and his
friends drank some punch at one par-

ty and““‘didn’t realize how potent it
was.”,

Hawthorne said, “From what I’m
told I fell over the end of the rail” of
the SAE staircase.

Hawthorne said that he only
scratched up his face some, ‘‘pretty
much like a skinned knee.”’

According to SAE president Cooper
Crawford, Hawthorne was walking
up the stairs at the front of the house
when he turned to vomit and fell over
the railing to the ground.

“T didn’t actually see him fall off,”’
said Crawford, who cited reports
from members who were at the front
door of the house, keeping the porch
clear and checking people entering
the party.

“T got there as soon as I could,”
Crawford added.

According to Crawford, there was
a small crowd of people around
Hawthorne, including two Virginia
Military Institute students, who
already had the situation under con-
trol.

Crawford said that shortly there-
after, one of the SAE brothers called
an ambulance for Hawthorne.

One student witness, who wished
not to be identified, related a slightly
different version of the story. “They
thought it was, like, killing their par-
ty,” he said, and they wanted him
gone.

The student said that the SAE
“brothers were just standing around

- fron Wilmington, NC; arrived at the:-doing-nothing.”’. However, ‘the: VMI -

cadets that checked Hawthorne for
injuries ‘‘did a good job.”

- Parties result in rule changes

Four houses are fined

for Rush violations

 

By SEAN BUGG

Editor

 

A number of fines and new Rush
regulations were given out at Tues-
day’s meeting of the Interfraternity
Council, according to IFC president
Chris Saxmon.

Four of Washington and Lee’s
seventeen fraternities received fines
of $300 for Rush violations. Two of
these four fraternities had a previous
violation.

One of these two fraternities was
given a week of social probation also,
while the other faces possible proba-
tion. This probation period would
begin Oct. 5 at 7:30 p.m. and end Oct.
12 at 7:30 p.m. :

Saxmon declined to release the
names of the fraternities involved in
order ‘‘to protect their names during
Rush.”

To combat the breaking: of Rush
rules, a new set of regulations was
set up governing the no contact time
that begins at 7:30 p.m. on
weeknights.

If a freshman is found at a fraterni-
ty house during no contact he can be
deprived of his Rush privileges for a
year, depending on the situation.
This means that the freshman could
not go through Rush and join a house
until next year.

A house that is caught violating
Rush rules cam be fined, and possibly
put on social probation.

Saxmon said that any action taken
by the IFC would depend on the situa-
tion. For example, if a freshman

walks into a house uninvited and is
found there just after his arrival, the
house may be found innocent of
breaking any rules.
situation.

Another new rule bans any alcohol
other than beer from being served at
parties during the Rush period.

Saxmon said that this new rule
made the Rush period more fair for
all the fraternities and safer for the
freshmen going through Rush.

“These actions had to be taken for
the safety of the freshmen,’’ Saxmon
said. He added that many of the
freshmen, none of whom are legal to
drink any alcoholic beverage, did not
drink hard liquor before college and
are not aware of the effects it may
have. =

Associate Dean of Students Leroy

 C, “Buddy” Atkins said in an earlier

interview that the IFC should be con-
ducting an investigation of the past
weekend’s events. Even if no Rush
violations are found, he said, some-
thing should be done. :

Commenting on what would hap-
pen if a fraternity is labeled responsi-
ble for the weekend incidents, Atkins
said, “It’s highly likely a punitive ac-
tion could be taken.”

Atkins also added that during the
past weekend, the chances of finding
a fraternity doing nothing wrong
were “not very likely.”

Atkins went on to say that the

-«~freshmen should find out as much as*~

possible about the responsible use of
alcohol, but that the fraternities are
providing the exact opposite, which
he calls “‘unfortunate.”’

iji

nears completion

 

By DEBORAH HATTES
Staff Reporter

 

After almost two years of
rebuilding, the Phi Gamma Delta
fraternity house is nearly finished.

According to Phi Gamma Delta
President Jim Cockey, a local con-
tracter will completely finish
rebuilding the 12,000 square foot
house by Oct. 31. Located on 112 West
Preston Street, the house for Phi
Gamma Delta (known as Fiji) was
destroyed by fire in April, 1984.
Rebuilding began that summer,
Cockey said.

The second and third floors are
totally finished, but the lower floors
are not yet completed, Cockey said.
The basement will be finished by
Sept. 20, and the first floor, including
the kitchen, by Oct. 31.

For the first time in three years the
Fiji house will handle Rush like other
fraternities, Cockey said. While the
house was being rebuilt, Fiji Rush
activities and parties were held at 108
Henry Street, where six brothers liv-
ed.

The 22 brothers living in the house
are leading nearly normal lives,
Cockey said. ‘‘The only thing we
can’t do is eat here,” he said. A
telephone will be installed this week.

Cockey termed the new Fiji house
“state of the art’’ since it was built
specifically as a fraternity house,
rather than being a converted family

home. The house has a staircase ris-
ing from the basement to the second
floor, a large dining room, and pay
laundry facilities and a guest
bathroom.

Another special feature of the
house is its basement party room,
with two-foot thick walls, a bar, and

did help minimize the noise”’ at a par-
ty last Friday night.

possible. He described the original
house built in 1891 as ‘‘an important
neighborhood landmark which really
anchors one of Lexington’s 19th cen-
tury neighborhoods.”

Cockey said the reconstruction was
financed by $400,000 of insurance
money and $275,000 from the Phi
Gamma Delta House Corporation.

To protect its investment in the
new Fiji house, Sessoms said, the
house corporation has hired Carrole
Vogat as a house mother. Now living
in Roanoke, she will move into a cot-
tage in a wing of the house after con-
struction is finished.

Vogat will be the first fraternity
house mother at W&L since the late
1970’s, according to Dean of Students
Lewis G. John. They were required
until the University Council voted to
make them optional in March, 1972.

Students glad to see Calyx on time

 

By PETER BOATNER
Staff Reporter

 

While reactions to the content of
this year’s Calyx, the Washington
and Lee yearbook, are mixed, at
least one thought was unamimous
among the student body: at least it’s
on time.

This year's volume, edited by
seniors Charles Nusbaum and Dennis
Francis, arrived from the printers
Sept. 8, in time for distribution to up-
perclassmen during matriculation.

The 1985 Calyx was delayed more

than four months, and was not passed
out until this February.

This year’s copy has sections on all
the activities of the school year, from
orientation week to graduation.

Nusbaum, who along with Francis,
stayed in Lexington until after
graduation and corrected proofs of
the book throughout the summer,
says it is possible to produce a com-
plete yearbook in a short time.

“It can work as a year-round book,
if a sophomore or junior does it, and
is willing to put a little time over the
summer into it,” he said.

Currently, no editor for this year’s

book has been selected, but Nusbaum
says that’s not a problem. ‘‘The first
deadline isn’t until April, so as long
as someone keeps on top of it, it’s not
crucial yet.”’

“We've gotten a lot of compliments
on the book. People have liked the
color photos and the picture on the
front cover,” he said. ‘‘Mostly, peo-
ple liked the fact that it was out on
time.”

Although reactions to the book
were generally good, students found
things wrong with it. John Metz, a
junior, said he thought the yearbook

was too plain. ‘‘Last year’s had a lot
of interesting sections,” he said.
“This year’s was too straight-
forward. I was also bugged that there
wasn’t an index.”

Jodi Ringland, a senior, also said
the book needed something more. ‘“‘It
looks good on the outside, but it lacks
something inside. It needed more
social events, more candid shots.”

Cathy McCubbin, a sophomore,
thought, however, that the book had
turned out well. “I liked this year’s
book better than last year’s,”’ she
said.

OPINION
Covering

This weekend, at least four freshmen were sent to the
hospital to have their stomachs pumped. They were diagnos-
ed as having ‘‘alcohol poisoning.”’

On Saturday night there was a case of a student, a
freshman, who had had too much to drink. The freshman fell
down the steps in front of a fraternity house, and was lying
there unconscious with blood oozing from his ear. None of the
party goers interrupted their reveries to get medical aid for
the student. Many said he was just drunk and complained
how the whole incident was ‘“‘bumming out’’ their party.
Finally, two VMI cadets, who were putting themselves at
risk to even be on fraternity property, gave the student
medical aid. (The cadets were later thrown off the property
without so much as a thank you. )

The incidents Saturday night and the new freshman dor-
mitory regulations on drugs and alcohol raise a question. At
what point do the fraternities or the University become
responsible for or have the right to tell students when, where,
or how much they can drink?

To answer this question, one must look at several factors.
The most obvious reason for the University’s new dormitory
regulations on alcohol and drugs is that most of the students
who live in the freshmen dormitories are too young by
Virginia State Law to drink alcohol, and for them to do so is
illegal. It would seem that an institution of higher learning
would want to teach its students to be law abiding, productive
citizens. Therefore the University should set a good example
and support the laws of the state. However, we don’t think the
University’s reasons are that pious.

What would have happened at that party if the cadets had
not been there? If the student had had a concussion and died
because no one got him medical help? You can be sure that
everyone including the Board of Trustees, the IFC, the
fraternity, and everyone at the party would have been sued.
(If an accident at a party bums you out, we wonder what ef-
fect being sued for everything you own would have on you.)

It’s commonly referred to as ‘‘covering yourself.’’ The new
dormitory regulations on alcohol and drugs seem to be a way
for the University to lessen the likelihood that it could be suc-
cessfully sued. If a student is breaking the rules by drinking
in the dorms, and later is injured as a result of his
drunkeness, it is improbable he could sue the University.

The four people who were sent to the hospital were
freshmen. The incidents that occurred during the weekend
seem to be a freshman phenomena. There are generally a
few cases of people testing their limits and inadvertantly ex-
ceeding those limits each year. Yet there have been lawsuits
recently in which an owner of a bar and the bartender were
sued by a customer who was served while he was obviously
intoxicated and was later injured as a result of his intoxica-
tion. It seems that fraternities and members of fraternities
could be named in similar suit as a result of this weekend’s
incidents. It would be in the fraternities’ best interests to find
a way to lessen their chances of being sued.

Perhaps the members of a fraternity could refuse to give
obviously drunk people another drink. To allow someone who
is on the verge of passing out even though it is still relatively
early in the evening to continue to drink is ridiculous. It may
be a drag to have to refuse someone another drink, but cover-
ing yourself now is better than being named in a lawsuit
later.

We are not advocating dry fraternity parties, nor are we
trying to be “‘holier than thou’’ with those who drink frequent-
ly to excess. It may be cliche, but the whole point is to drink
responsibly. No one should have to end a party night in a
hospital room.

Covering it all

The Ring-tum Phi is the student newspaper of Washington
and Lee. It is run completely by students. We have no faculty
advisor. The Ring-tum Phi (the name, by the way, is from a
nonsense football cheer that became extinct long ago) brings
you the latest campus and local news, sports, music and
movie reviews, and tries to discuss issues that are of interest
to W&L’s students.

We are not the opinion of the whole student body. When an
editorial appears in the Phi unsigned, it is the opinion of the
editorial board, namely, Jason Lisi, Sean Bugg, and Marie
Dunne. If the editorial is signed (-MED appears at the bottom
of the column), it is the opinion of editorial page editor, Marie
Dunne.

Part of the purpose of an editorial page is to get people
thinking about and responding to the issues. The best way to
make your response known is to write a letter to the editors.
Letters let us know what our readers are thinking and are
concerned about and what we can do to improve the Phi. So
the next time you start to mutter about how off base (or on
target) the editorial is, write in and tell us what you think and
why.

Can the Hill and frats get along?

MY VIEW
By Mark Farley

Arather dismal situation confronts
the new Dean of Fraternities, Mr.
Leroy C. “‘Buddy’’ Atkins, and the
Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) as
they assume their duties this fall.
The fraternities at Washington and
Lee are experiencing hard times:
some, with the declining number of
men enrolled, are failing to recruit
enough new members; many are
burdened with financial problems;
the newly passed Alcohol Beverage
Control laws bring with them a
plethora of regulations and heart-
aches; and last Spring when the IFC
was asked to adopt a strict anti-drug
policy, it was implied that the frater-
nities were at the center of W&L’s
drug woes.

Unfortunately, Dean Atkins is not a
magician; he cannot make these pro-
blems just disappear. The difficult

 

times will continue. More likely than
not some fraternities may be forced
to close in the coming years.

There is one task to which the new
dean and the IFC should devote
themselves: alleviate the heighten-
ing sense of antagonism developing
between the fraternities and the Hill.
Increasingly, fraternity members
perceive an anti-fraternity sentiment
echoing down the Colonnade. This
bitterness, stemming primarily from
the weekday and other social restric-
tions imposed in the past four years,
does nothing to help the fraternity
system.

Both the Hill and the fraternities
are stuck with each other. Dean
Atkins should help them realize this.
The students have to accept that
their houses are affiliated with the
University and, as a result, must
agree to a certain degree of control.
Furthermore, no matter how disrup-
tive the faculty may view the frater-
nities’ social reveries and other hi-
jinks, it must accept the view stated

by the Board of Trustees in its Policy
Statement on Fraternities: ‘Social
fraternities at Washington and Lee
are a valuable and integral part of
both the University and Lexington
communities.’’ One reason for this is
that without the national fraternities
on campus the social lives of many
students would be abysmal, most
certainly diminishing the Universi-
ty’s attractiveness to prospective
students.

Also, the administration should
concede, as most parents do, that
young men and women are capable
of making decisions on their own - in-
deed should be encouraged to do so.
The IFC must be allowed to function
and act without undo pressure from
the Hill. Dean Atkins should help
both sides to understand and even-
tually compromise on the important
issues presently facing them, such as
the concepts of deferred Rush and an
eventual IFC drug policy. In addi-
tion, he should function as the frater-
nities’ advocate on the Hill, stressing

the importance of maintaining the
fraternity system’s autonomy.

The IFC must then be prepared to
deal quickly and effectively with the |

issues at hand. Slowness on the part
of the IFC will only serve to ag-
gravate already sensitive issues.
This would also risk having key deci-
sions made by the Hill instead of by
the council. Ignoring a glaring pro-
blem is not an effective resolution.

Lastly, the IFC and the fraternity
members themselves must be willing
to accept and sometimes carry out
recommendations and advice offered
by Dean Atkins and his colleagues.
Not to do so would be most foolish
considering their collective ex-
perience as well as their knowledge
of the current situation.

Given the critical role of the Greek
system at W&L, as well as the impor-
tance this institution places on stu-
dent government and independence,
it should be the hope of the entire
Washington and Lee community that
Dean Atkins and the IFC succeed.

Student recounts unusual friendship

 

MY VIEW
By Paul J. Smith

 

I dedicate this article to Igor,
Arkadi and George. These three men
were studying Chinese language in
China at the same time I was. What
made our relationship special was
that it defied political restrictions
and cultural boundaries. It was of-
ficially forbidden.

My three friends were from
Russia, Igor was from a city in cen-
tral Siberia, Arkadi from Moscow
and George from Leningrad.

I met them at Fu Dan University in
Shanghai where they were studying.
Igor and Arkadi were in their mid-
thirties, had wives and children and
were dedicated to the system from
which they were begotten. George
was in his mid-twenties, and clearly
headed for a career in the Soviet
diplomatic service.

Scene: Shanghai train station, ear-
ly February. I take bus No. 61 to Fu
Dan University. Igor is surprised to
see that I have taken up his offer to
stay with them at Fu Dan. That night
he buys a bottle of Chinese rum
(which is horrible). I take out my bot-
tle of Johnny Walker which I bought

in Hong Kong. They are curious
about Hong Kong as they are restrict-
ed by their government from visiting
there. I try to describe it as best I can
with my Chinese (only George could
speak English).

Scene: The foreign student cafeter-
ia at Fu Dan. They take me to the
cafeteria and introduce me to their
friends. I shake everyone’s hand and
greet them in Chinese. A few of them
can speak some English. We all eat
together. In the other part of the
cafeteria, I spot students from all
parts of the world — Europe, Africa,
the Middle East — all chatting
among themselves. But the Russians
eat together as a separate group, as
though a large family impenetrable
from the outside.

Scene: A dormitory sitting room.
The Russians bring vodka, the
Chinese rum and peanuts. I bring my
JW and my Chinese dictionary. After
all, it is five Russians and only one
American. I’ll have to hold my own.

They first hit me with Reagan. Do
people in America really like that
man? I tell them they do. He makes
them feel proud. I ask them what
they think about the concept of
democracy. They say they like it, and
quickly produce a book which they
claim is compiled of criticisms of the
communist party, and at the same

time is produced by the communist
party! If I could only read Russian!
They tell me about life in the Soviet
Union, Tranquil. Peaceful. If you
don’t want to go anywhere, you will
feel comfortable there, they tell me.
For the ambitious, it can be another
story. We then drink more vodka.
Then I hit them with the Korean
Air Line mishap (I thought I would
cut them off with this question, but
somehow they seemed to be prepared
for this one). How can your country
shoot down a passenger plane over
international waters? It was ‘‘a spy
plane!”’ they reply emphatically.
“The CIA was involved!’’ they say.
Then they talk to themselves in Rus-
sian. I pour some of the Johnny
Walker. They drink it. Then one looks
at me and says in Chinese, ‘‘We
might have screwed up on that one.”’
And then I laugh at the absurdity of
their answer, then they laugh. I know
we should not laugh. But then I
realize that we are laughing only at
the absurdity of who we are, and
where we are from. We are supposed
to be enemies, so how can it be that
we can sit here and talk like old
friends who have not seen each other
in ages? How can it be that our
governments have ICBMs pointed at
each other’s home cities? They tell
me the Soviets are peace-loving peo-

LETTERS

ple. I tell them the Americans are as
well, So why do we live in the precar-
ious world that we do?

And then I realize the truth might
lie in the fact that exchanges such as
this one, the one I was experiencing
with Igor, Arkadi, and George, are so
rare. How often can Americans (who
are not diplomats, reporters, etc...)
meet with their Soviet counterparts?
Why is it that the only exchange be-
tween the two countries seems to oc-
cur only with the big media cover-
age, such as the Geneva Summit and
the Turner Olympics, which tries to
commercialize relations between the
two most powerful nations on this
planet? 1 have always thought that
the best diplomats are not the pro-
fessional diplomats, but the plain,
everyday ones like you and me.
Hopefully, for the sake of world
peace, this sort of exchange will
become more and more possible in
the future. But it seems that under
the present political climate, one
marked with increasing hostility and
mistrust, this is becoming more and
more improbable...which only makes
me cherish the memories of my Rus-
sian friends. The friendship between
us may not bring about world peace,
but at least it could be a start...a
flicker of hope in the growing
darkness of global tension.

Alcohol Awareness Comm. seeks counselors

(eee

 

 

To the editors:

The Alcohol and Health Awareness Commit-
tee, which is beginning its second year, is respon-
sible for the overall coordination of alchol, drugs
and other health-related awareness programs at
W&L. Its purpose is to establish goals and objec-
tives geared toward the promotion of health and
total wellness.

An off-shoot of this committee is a volunteer
peer counseling program, which will be initiated
this fall. The goal of a peer counselor is to have
trained students, knowledgeable in the areas of
alcohol and drug abuse, who can advise W&L
students in this regard. With improved commu-
nication skills and the ability to recognize a de-
veloping drug or alcohol problem, the peer coun-
selor can either work directly with students or if
desirable make an appropriate referral to other
counseling resources. Peer counselors may also
talk with students having other kinds of personal
issues as well, such as difficulties in a personal
relationship or academic problems.

The training program will begin in early Octo-
ber. There will be a half-day retreat followed by
weekly one hour sessions throughout the semes-
ter. One or two brief evening training sessions
may also be required in the beginning of the
training.

The selection committee is seeking volunteers
who are interested in helping others. Students
are asked to complete a questionnaire to include

a letter of interest. The counselors will be chosen
on the basis of a review of the questionnaire and
successful completion of the training process.
Questionnaires are available in room 104 of the
University Center. Any questions may be direct-
ed to Mrs. Calkins or Dr. Worth at EXT. 8590.

Mandak thanks APO

To the editors:

On behalf of the dormitory counselor staff, I
would like to thank Steve Pockrass and the other
members of Alpha Phi Omega service fraternity
for their help during freshmen orientation week.
In addition to helping the freshmen move in, they
were also called upon to direct the “R&R”
events on Wednesday and they took over opera-
tion of the refrigerator rental system. APO truly
performed up to expectations this past week. We
appreciate their assistance and look forward to
working with them again in the future.

GHQ rules’ irks reader

To the editors:

Mr. Gerald Darrell hurled another thunderbolt
from the Cockpit/GHQ. This one really hurts, but

misses the target completely. Citing ‘problems
with people passing pitchers around”’ to minors,
Mr. Darrell will strike a blow for lawfulness
every Wednesday by banning pitchers of beer.
Only 14-0z. cups will be sold.

Now there’s logic for you, boys and girls. Next,
Mr. D. will explain just how good bathtub gin
really is.

Yes, there are underage drinkers in the
Pit/GHQ on any night of the week. Pitchers
facilitate - but do not cause - the problem. Go for
the bull’s eye, Mr. D.! Enforce Virginia's drink-
ing laws by clearly marking the underage with a
bracelet, not by changing our beer’s size. The
same people who would survey for illicit sipping
from little cups could easier spot marked of-
fenders sidling up to a ‘‘big boy”’ for a quick gulp.
Then, Mr. D., kick the youngsters out who can’t
party by the rules. Your older patrons won't take
offense.

Wednesday nights at the Pit/GHQ (yes, its a
silly name for a pub, but I’m stubborn) are
already hot, costly, and crowded. Making us
stand in line every time we want a drink won't
help. There’s only so much a mortal can take.

“Sam Houston probably was the

Ann Richards, a speaker at the
ceremony. Houston served as the
president of the Republic of Texas,
U.S. Senator and governor of Texas
and Congressman and Governor of
Tennessee.

The monument is a 38,000 pound
piece of pink Texas granite shipped
by railroad from a quarry in Marble
Falls, Texas. A bronze plaque bear-
ing a 200-word history of Sam
Houston and his achievements is at-
tached to the front of the stone. A
cast-iron fence around the monument
was donated by the Sam Houston
Rurtarian Club, a Virginia group.

The monument replaces one

1979. :

A 60-piece band from VMI played
the state songs from Virginia, Ten-
nesse and Texas in Sunday's near-
perfect weather. Flag-bearing honor

Washington and Lee is known for
ts picturesque Colonnade, excellent
.cademic reputation and unwaver-
ng dedication to George Washington
ind Robert E. Lee. But many people
\o not know that it also has one of the
tiost comprehensive collections of
‘hinese export and 18th century Eur-
ypean porcelain on any college cam-
dus.

The Reeves Center, tucked away
tween Tucker Hall and the Gilliam
jouse, is a restored faculty
.ome that now serves as a research
rfuseum. On any given day you can
ind people touring the center or
tudents researching the histories
onnected with the porcelain.

(“To many students, this place
‘oks like a storage house for bowls
yd plates,” said Baxter Sharp, a

 

junior who has worked in the center
for three years. ‘‘Actually, we have
several rare and historical pieces.”’

Sharp pointed out the center’s priz-
ed possession, a Hong bow] — nearly
180-years-old — showing interna-
tional trade from the port of Canton,
China on its sides.

W&L received the collection from
Mr. and Mrs. Euchlin D. Reeves, of
Providence, R.I. Mr. Reeves was a
1927 graduate of the Law School. The
couple acquired so many pieces they
had to find another home.

Mrs. Reeves was also a painter,
but her work went undiscovered until
1968, when workers brought along
dust-covered frames with the
porcelain collection. Once the dust
was removed, they found paintings of
exceptional quality. Among the
works were scenes from Paris, her
porcelain collection and several pic-
tures of her Aunt Lizzie.

Today, over 2,000 pieces of porce-
lain, furniture and paintings fill five
major exhibit rooms, reflecting

several themes and periods in
history.

One room has pieces that date to
the infancy of this country. Various
plates and cups show the signing of
the Declaration of Independence with

Junior David Montgomery, of Po-
quoson, is suspected of discharging a
handgun and setting off several
firecrackers after a Sept. 11 incident
at the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity
house, police said Tuesday.

A police report states that two of-
ficers responded to a complaint that
firecrackers were being discharged

Davis papers at Law library

A collection of memorabilia associated with the
career of lawyer and advocate John W. Davis went on
display in June in the Washington and Lee University
Law Library.

The collection was presented to the university this
spring by Davis’ daughter, Mrs. Julia Davis Adams,
and includes a variety of prints, presidential proclama-
tions, drawings, photographs, plaques and books col-
lected by Davis during his lifetime.

Davis was born in West Virginia in 1873 and received
his B.A. and B.L. degrees from Washington and Lee in
1892 and 1895. He served as a Congressman from West
Virginia and as Solicitor General under Woodrow Wil-
son’s presidency. In 1922 he turned down an appoint-
ment to the Supreme Court and in 1924 ran unsuccess-
fully for President against Calvin Coolidge.

During his career Davis argued 141 cases before the
Supreme Court, including the steel seizure cases and
Brown vs. Board of Education.

The W&L Law Library also has in its collection,
Davis’ papers, including the briefs of the cases which he

argued. Davis Dormitory, which opened in 1959 and is
_ one of the three major buildings housing W&L
freshmen, was named after Davis.

Herrick evaluates Guatemala

Bruce Herrick, head of the Department of Economics
at Washington and Lee, recently returned from Guate-
emala where he spent three weeks evaluating economic
and financial aspects of Guatemalan health care.

Herrick was invited to perform the evaluation by the
U.S. Agency for International Development. While in
Guatemala he served as health economist on a five-
member team.

The team sought to gather data and assess the cur-
rent condition of Guatemalan health care.

While Herrick’s research was conducted largely in
Guatemala City, he also toured rural health posts and
clinics, interviewing paramedical personnel and mid-
wives. Many of the country’s health problems, Herrick
said, are associated with the lack of roads in the moun-
tains and jungles, low levels of literacy, and the
absence of safe water and sanitary facilities.

Herrick received his A.B. degree from Carleton Col-
lege in Minnesota. He received his Ph.D. in economics
from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1964,

the same year he joined the faculty of the University of
California at Los Angeles.

Herrick came to W&L in 1980. He is the co-author of
several books and has contributed numerous articles
and chapters in professional journals and anthologies.

Political commentator to speak

_Dr. Norman J. Ornstein, resident scholar at the
American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy
Research, will be visiting lecturer at Washington and
Lee University September 25-26.

Sponsored by the Phi Beta Kappa ‘Visiting Scholar
Program, Ornstein’s visit is designed to enable
undergraduates and faculty members to meet formally
and informally with noted scholars in diverse disci
plines for two days on the campus.

Ornstein’s visit will be highlighted by a public lecture
entitled ‘‘Can the Constitution Survive the Third Cen-
tury?’ at 8 p.m. Thursday, September 25, in the Moot
Courtroom of Lewis Hall, the W&L law school.

Prior to his tenure at the American Enterprise In-
stitute for Public Policy Research, Ornstein was pro-
fessor of politics at the Catholic University of America,
where he began teaching in 1972. He is a regular con-
tributor to ‘‘The MacNeil/Lehrer New Hour,” series
editor of “‘Congress: We the People,” a 26-part public
television program, and election consultant to CBS

same day Read’s sexual misconduct
hearing resumed in the Rockbridge
County Courthouse. Rigsby said he
showed the order to Read’s attorney,
Joseph M. Spivey III of Richmond, on
Friday.

On the sexual misconduct charges,
Read had his choice between a pri-
vate board hearing and a public hear-
ing before a three-judge panel. He
chose the public hearing, which
began on July 9 and 10.

A Republican with strong family
ties to Rockbridge County, Read tem-
porarily stepped down as the area's
chief prosecutor July 11. He quit July
18, after serving as commonwealth’s
attorney for more than 10 years.

At the first day of the hearing on
July 9, seven women who had sought
Read’s advice as a private attorney
said that he had fondled them, strok-
ed himself, rubbed his stocking feet
on their legs or made lewd comments
to them. One said Read had exposed
himself in his office and had tried to
force her to have oral sex with him.
All of the alleged acts were said to
have occurred between 1977 and 1984.

An eighth woman, who had worked
with Read in the local court system,
testified that during phone conversa-
tions about court cases, Read would
describe in crude terms the sexual
acts he wanted to perform on her.

The defense did not present its case
on the second day of the July hearing.

Buxton, a Richmond psychiatrist,
presented some of his findings.

Buxton said that when Jane G.
Read was dying, John Read, then 14,
tried unsuccessfully to resuscitate
her. Buxton also noted that while
Read was recuperating from his war
wounds, “his company apparently
was wiped out,” leaving Read with
“survivor's guilt.’’

A narcissistic personality disorder
is one ‘‘in which there is a grandiose
sense of self-importance or unique-
ness,” according to the ‘‘Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders’’ by the American
Psychiatric Association. People suf-
fering from the disorder have a need
for constant admiration and atten-
tion, and their ‘‘exaggerated sense of
self-importance may be manifested
as extreme self-centeredness and
self-absorption. Abilities and
achievements tend to be
unrealistically overestimated. Fre-
quently the sense of self-importance
alternates with feelings of special un-
worthiness.”’

Read’s mother died of an overdose
of barbituates in 1958, according to
an Indiana death certificate. A later
state record recorded her death as an
accidental drug overdose.

Buxton said that when Jane G.
Read was dying, her 14-year-old son
tried unsuccessfully toe resuscitate
her. Buxton also noted that while

Underage drinkers in dorms
could face fines if caught

 

By JASON LISI
Editor

 

The arrival of the class of 1990, a
group of students almost entirely
under the alcohol drinking age in
Virginia, are subject to a new for-
malized set of penalties for drinking
and drug use in the dormitories.

The new dorm rules set a standar-
dized system of punishment for
freshmen who possess alcohol or
drugs on first, second and third of-
fenses. After the third offense, the
policy says, a freshman may be ex-
pelled from the dormitory indefinite-
ly.

The rule says, simply, that there
will be no alcohol or drugs allowed in
the dorms at any time by freshmen.
The only alcohol in the dorms can be
in the possession of the dorm coun-
selors who are above the legal drink-
ing age.

Would like to welcome back all W&L students
and special welcome to W&L Coeds.

The reason formalized rules had to
be applied, Head Dormitory Coun-
selor Jeff Mandak said, was because
of problems that arose due to dif-
ferences in the way last year’s dorm
counselors punished freshmen who
possessed or used alcohol or drugs in
their dorm rooms.

The punishments in the new policy
are a combination of fines and refer-
rals to Dean of Freshmen H. Robert
Huntley, and get more serious with
each additional offense.

A freshman caught possessing
alcohol or drugs once will be fined
five dollars and sent to Huntley. A
freshman breaking the rules twice
will be fined $15 and sent to Huntley,
who will notify the student’s parents
of the violation. At the third offense,
a student will be fined $25, sent to
Huntley and the student’s expulsion
from the dormitory will be con-
sidered.

The new policy was written by a
subcommittee of the Alcohol and
Health Awareness Committee, a

Washington and Lee group dedicated
to teaching responsible and legal
drinking in the W&L community. The
subcommittee, the Policy and Ad-
ministrative Committee, drew the
rules up last spring, which were put
into effect when the members of the
freshman class attended hall
meetings Sept. 7.

Mandak said that this policy makes
the dorm counselor’s job an easier
one because there is a set way the
counselors must treat alcohol and
drug possession, rather than last
year when the severity of punish-
ment was due largely to the discre-
tion of the individual counselor. ‘‘It
was difficult for us to work with each
other because we were being incon-
sistent,’”’ Mandak said.

Third-year Law student and dorm
counselor Dandrea Miller said, with
time, inconsistency of the punish-
ment has ill effects on both the dorm
rules and the counselors. “After a
while, the regulation is no longer
taken seriously,”’ she said.

Entertainment Editor

 

When I was a freshman, I can
recall going through Rush without
any idea, whatsoever, of what I was
actually doing. I was continually ask-
ing myself, ‘‘What comes next?’’ It
was rather like agreeing to play a
couple of hands of poker without ever
having played the game before.
Because, when you get right down to
it, how many freshmen can honestly

Peeeecerreererrer er

t

eral ezat}

eae eee semn mmm conocer senna

Beta Theta Pi

say they’ve been through Rush
before?

So, to lessen the amount of risk in-
volved in the process, here is a
simplified, by-the-week, account of
“How Rush Works.”’ It is quite sim-
ple, as you’ll soon see; the key is
knowing, beforehand, what you are
getting yourself into.

For starters, keep one thing in
mind: the cards are in your hand.
The fraternities want you to join
them, and they’ll certainly let you
know about it. So relax; you have

plenty of decisions to make and there
is no need for anxiety and worry.

Secondly, be yourself. Let the real
you show through. The only impres-
sion you need to worry about making
is an honest one. Now, here is how
this whole thing works. This Sunday
will be the official start of Rush. At
11:00 a.m., every fraternity on cam-
pus will set up a table in the Gilliam-
Baker-Davis quad. There you will be
able to sign up for Open Houses.
These are usually coat-and-tie affairs
which let the brothers in a house get
to know you better. If you remember
a few faces from a house, recall a
particularly fun evening last week-
end, whatever — then put your name
down on that house’s sign-up sheet.
The brothers will come to your dorm
and get you. They will escort you to
their house and there you can begin
meeting the brothers in a relaxed
social atmosphere. There will be soft
drinks served, more than likely, but
no alcohol is allowed.

At the Open Houses, brothers
might ask you to come back. In
Washington and Lee lingo, this is
usually, ‘‘We got ya’ comin’ back?”
You’ll probably end up hearing this
phrase in your sleep. What this

ay

means is simply that the brothers
have taken an interest in you. What
you will be “‘comin’ back”’ to is, in
W&L’s Rush-talk, a ‘Rush Date.”
These are longer than open houses
and even more relaxed, since every-
one there is a return visitor.

By now, you should be getting a

good idea where you might or might.

not fit in. The key to joining the right
house is finding the right people.
That is what the Rush Dates and
Open Houses are are for. It’s as sim-
ple as that.

Now, if there is still some doubt in
your mind, there are weekend par-
ties and get-togethers to see each
house better. Remember this: every
house on this campus is, for better or
for worse, a social organization. It
can be hard sometimes, but try to
remember at which house you had a
fun time and at which you did not.

Now, beginning Oct. 1, bids can be
given out. A bid is exactly what you
might think it is: it is a house telling
you that they want you as one of their
brothers. Most of the houses on cam-

‘pus are one-ball houses. This means

that it only takes one person in the en-
tire fraternity to disagree with a

perspective and that perspective
does not get a bid. So if you get a bid,
it means, generally, that the entire
house likes you and wants you to bea
brother.

Beginning Oct. 3, bids will be ac-
cepted. When you accept a bid — that
is, agree to joing a certain fraternity
— you are doing what is called ‘“‘tear-
ing.”’ If you go to a house where
you’ve been given a bid, and you
want to join, you tell a brother, usual-
ly the Rush chairman, if the house
has one, that you ‘‘want to tear.’”

pha Epsilon

This is a big decision and remember,
you are holding all the cards. A bid is
good for a year. Don’t let anyone
pressure you; join when and where
you want to join.

So that is how all of this nonsense
works. It is not so complicated as it is
mysterious. One last thing: Rush is a
lot of fun. Otherwise, there really
isn’t any reason to go through the
trouble. So, enjoy yourself, think
about what you're doing, and, good
luck.

‘downs Shenandoah, 3-1 Dedication & Sacrifice

By MIKE SHADY
Assistant Sports Editor

 

Most of today’s sports teams are
cast in the role of underachievers,
This year’s Washington and Lee
men’s soccer team will not fall in that
category.

Yesterday, the Generals scored an
impressive 3-1 victory in its season
opener at Shenandoah. What made
the win so surprising is how sharp
W&L looked this early in the fall
schedule.

The Generals drew first blood
when sophomore Johnny Sarber
found the net at 19:38 of the first half.
Ten minutes later, it was Sarber
again as he gave W&L a comman-
ding 2-0 lead going into halftime.

Early in the second half, Shenan-
doah remained within striking
distance and cut W&L’s lead in half
to 2-1. The Generals appeared some-
what sluggish and this threw a scare
into Piranian.

“We didn’t come out playing too
well in the second half, and I became
nervous,” said Piranian. “It was a
good test of character.”

The Generals finally put the game
out of reach when they closed out the
scoring, giving W&L that all impor-
tant first game win. Piranian, who is
in his ninth year at W&L, was “‘pleas-
ed with the overall effort” as his
team continues its preparation for
the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference with two games this weekend
in the North Carolina Wesleyan tour-
nament.

“IT was really surprised as to how
well we played in our first game,”
said head coach Rolf Piranian. “I
didn’t expect to do that well.’’

On the ODAC, Piranian feels that
Lynchburg, in view of its early
season record, is the ‘‘team to beat,”’
but feels that W&L is under a han-
dicap due to its late start.

“Yes, it’s a disadvantage, but I feel
that in a couple of weeks we will be
able to catch up,” said Piranian.
“That’s why we start our ODAC
schedule so late. It’s the school’s
schedule so there is really nothing we
can do about it.”

 

 

Piranian;: “I was...surprised how well we played in our first

game.”’

Harriers look strong as preparation continues
Many more women are participating this year

By ELIZABETH PARKINS
Staff Reporter

 

The men’s and women’s cross
country season doesn’t officially
begin until September 27 when the
two teams meet Mary Washington
and Washington at home. However,
they are not waiting around for the
season to start. Both teams have
been running daily around and
through Lexington. This past week
the women’s team began running on
the official 3.1 mile course. Although

times were not kept, the run gave the- -

women a chance to develop a sense of
what the course would be like.

“Some of the women really like the
hilly course but others were not so

agreeable,” said Sophomore Tracy
Williams

This years women’s team has
grown consideralbly in size since last
year, Where there was once only four
or five women running there are now
between thriteen and sixteen. In ad-
dition to these thirteen to sixteen, two
women from the law school have
been participating in the team’s
workout. While most of the new
members are freshmen several
sophomores have joined the team for

the first time. Copeland Kapp, Benny -

Savage, and Williams, along with
Anne Geary, and Kim Eadie who
were both injured last year, round
out the team. Yet all the news is not
good, top runner from last year,
Carolyn Abrogast will not be running
this year due to a knee injury.

One final change for this year is the
chance for the team to compete for
the ODAC title. Since last fall three
other schools in the ODAC con-
ference have added cross country
programs enabling an official con-
ference to be formed.

The men’s cross country team
seems to be coming together fairly
well. Again, Coach Miller does not

season except to say they will be
looking at each meet as it comes
along. The team will be built around
a strong core of returning seniors,
Captain Ted Meyers, Michael Freid-
man, and Ash Andrews. Also running
will be Junior Scott Rippeon and
Richard Moore and Sophomore
Michael Watson. The top runner last
year Scott Rippeon, will again be the
leading runner this year. Rippeon
last year ran a 27:50 in the 8,000
meters and finished 6th overall in the
NCAA South Regionals.

This fall the men’s team will host

Imagine yourself being jolted from that safe, warm bed of yours at 6
a.m. by the harsh buzz of an alarm clock. Next, see if you can feel the
cold of the floor on your feet as you stumble toward the dresser, at-
tempting to find some suitable clothing. Then, visualize walking up to
the Warner Center for your morning workout.

Now, picture attending a whole day of classes. A pretty full
schedule, uh? I’m sure you can now fantasize about heading back to
your room to relax for a little while. Wait, not yet.

Conceive going back to your dresser at 3:15 p.m. and putting on your
bathing suit, this time for the afternoon workout.

And, following the afternoon workout, which ends at six, imagine go-
ing to the library to do all your homework and preparation for the next
day’s classes.

Does it sound like something that you would do? It certainly isn’t
something that I would want to do. But it is something that about
18 Washington and Lee students do each day as a part of their train-
ing program for the water polo team, and, since all water polo players
are also members of the swim team, these same students/athletes
continues this type of schedule during the winter swim season as well.
For those of you who were counting, that’s about six months of that
type of schedule.

Water polo has been at Washington and Lee for around 13 years and
W&L Head Coach Page Remillard has been in charge of both the water
polo and swimming programs for the last nine years. In that time he
has produced All-Americans in both polo and swimming.

As one could probably guess, the water polo players are a very
dedicated group of men. How dedicated? The 6 a.m. workout is op-
tional, yet according to Remillard, the great majority of the team at-
tends. “I don’t even go,” said Remillard, ‘“‘just to re-inforce the idea
that it’s not required.”

“These guys are willing to go the extra mile,”’ said Remillard. “Ata
lot of schools players will get scholarships and the coach will use that
to motivate his players but here it’s different.’’ Remillard continued,
“‘We have a bunch of guys who are self-motivated.”

Their self-motivation shone through two weeks ago when the team
went out to Buena Vista in order to run The Mountain.

Beginning at the edge of Buena Vista, the team ran on Route 60 to
the Skyline Drive, almost four miles, all of it uphill. This unusual
adventure was an aquatics tradition until last year, when the team
didn’t make the run. This year some of the players came to Remillard
and asked him if they could do it this year. Imagine, asking if you
could do something like that. That’s sort of like asking your history
professor if you could write a 15-page term paper just because you
want to prove something to yourself.

And while on the subject of the classroom, you might expect the
player’s grades to suffer as a result of all this intense training (not to
mention the actual competitions). Guess again.

The polo team had the fourth highest GPA of any W&L athletics
team in the most recently available figures with an average of 2.799.
This is well above the all-student average of 2.686.

“Their academic production in season is superior to their off-season
production,” noted Remillard. “It might be they just don’t pro-
crastinate during the season.”’

Oh, and yes, not only do they train extremely hard, and not only do
they perform in the classroom, they also win.

They opened the 1986 season in fine fashion by taking second place in
the eight-team field at the Fall Classic, held right here at Cy Trombly
pool last weekend.

What does all this mean? Well, not much to you and me, but I know it
would mean a lot to the athletes on the polo team if we could get out
and show some support. Just look around the school, there’s always
posters announcing all the matches. I hope to see some of you at the

~poel in thefuture.

Theatre raises curtain on new season

 

 

By EVELYN M. FAHY
Staff Reporter

 

"he University Theatre, a quaint
building next to Sigma Nu fraternity,
is permeated with a sense of tradi-
tion. Despite its cracked walls and
grafitti adorned shop walls, the
theatre conveys a sense of intimacy
invaluable to theatrical production.

At last Tuesday’s annual open
house, while guests mingled and en-
joyed a wine and cheese reception,
slides of past productions rotated on
& projection screen to the tune of old
world music. Director of the theatre,
Al Gordon, called the guests’ atten-
tion to summarize the events sched-
uled for the 1986-1987 school year.

lhe season will open Oct. 17 with a
musical cabaret put on by a troupe of
singers and dancers known as the
‘Mixed Minks.’’ The group’s aim is
to celebrate coeducation through
musical comedy and, according to
sophomore Elizabeth Fowler, a
member of Mixed Minks, the troupe
is seeking new members. Auditions
will be held Sept. 23 at 8:00 p.m. in
duPont 102.

The highlight of the season will un-
doubtedly be the Oct. 31 world
premiere of ‘“Roscius,”’ a play writ-
ten by Rose Gordon, concerning the
life of 18th century Shakespearean
actor David Garrick. The play,

which, Rose Gordon terms “retro-
spective,” will delve into the ‘‘mean-
ing of his Garrick’s life, coordinated
with his stage life. It asks the au-
dience to evaluate.”’

“Roscius” will star W&L alumnus
Paul Norwood, ‘73, who has worked
extensively with the much respected
Folger Shakespearean Theatre in
Washington, D.C. Many other roles
need to be filled, though, and audi-
tions will be held Thursday, Sept. 18,
and Friday, Sept. 19, at 7:00 p.m. in
the University Theatre on Henry
Street.

On Dec. 2, a one-man touring show,
“Oh, Mr. Faulkner, Do you Write?,”’
will come to the University Theatre
to wrap-up the fall season. Other pro-
ductions slated for the remainder of
the year are the musical ‘‘Cabaret,”’
a senior major’s production, and a
play based on Carson McCuller’s
“Ballad of the Sad Cafe.”

Gordon introduced the newest ad-
ditions to the theatre faculty and
staff. Replacing Thomas Ziegler,
who is on sabbatical, is Don Lillie,
designer, and replacing Skip Ever-
son is technician Gary Huminston.
Also new to the University Theatre is
secretary Katrina Alderson.

Gordon went on to encourage as
many people as possible to par-
ticipate in the University Theatre
and he noted that ‘‘building up the au-
dience”’ is a main goal for the upcom-
ing season.

The Smiths: Love ‘em or leave ‘em

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Entertainment Editor

 

Liking the Smiths is basically a
question of whether or not one likes
the group’s lead singer, Morrissey.
His monotonous whine, pompous
British foppishness, and frequent
forays into the Sylvia Plath school of
self-absorption have put off many
listeners. Add to that his alledged
homosexuality (although he now
swears he is celibate), his odd stage
presence and his general eccentricity
(he wears a hearing aid even though
his hearing is perfect), and one can
see why he might be a difficult per-
son to swallow.

 

 

But Morrisey likes it that way. He
is proud of the fact that people either
love or hate the Smiths. He even
sings on their new album: ‘“‘She said,
‘I know you and you cannot sing’/I
said, ‘That’s nothing, you should hear
me play piano.’ ”’

So, here is basically the word on
this new Smith’s LP: if you love the
Smiths, you are going to adore ‘‘The
Queen is Dead,” and if you hate
them, well, you just don’t know what
you’re missing.

Oh, Morrissey is pure Morrissey,
all right, but he also has one of the
most acute senses of humor in cur-
rent pop music — a distinction his
detractors often overlook. Try these

lines, from “Big Mouth Strikes
Again:”’ ‘‘And now I know how Joan
of Arc felt/when the flames rose to
her Roman nose/and her Walkman
started to melt.’’ Or this from the
Kinks — like ‘Frankly, Mr. Shank-
ley:’’ I want to live and I want to
love/I want to catch something that I
might be ashamed of.”’

Moreover — and, certainly, more
important — Morrissey is a pro-
digious lyricist. His subject matter
on the new LP - loneliness, stardom,
the monarchy, the creative muse,
Oscar Wilde and Transvestisism—is
as intriguing as it is varied. His lyrics
are about as close to poetry as
anything in pop music. (Sorry, Bruce
Springsteen...) His best moments

come in brilliantly concise couplets,
like, “‘As you crawl into an empty
bed/Oh well, enough said,” and “‘I’ll
meet you at the cemetery (sic)
gates/Keats and Yeats are on your
side/but Wilde is on mine.’’ He has
problems — too wordy, too self-
indulgent—but this is only pop music.
And the music? Well, that is what
the Smiths are overlooked for more
than anything else. Mark my words:
Johnny Marr is the most underrated
guitarist in pop music today. His
psychedelic cacaphony on “The
Queen Is Dead’’ is riveting, his
Townshead-influenced acousitc
guitar strumming on “Big Mouth
Strikes Again’ is powerful and his
lush chord arrangements on
‘Cemetery Gates” and “I Know Its
Over” are warm and passionate.

So, if you hate the Smiths, then you
don’t know what you’re missing. And
if you love’em (like me), then ‘‘The
Queen Is Dead’ is your platter du
jour. Self-indulgence has never been
this sasy to dance to.

the audience this reporter was with,
but none of us has the guts of junior
flight officer Ripley, played by the at-
tractive and intelligent Sigourney
Weaver.

“Aliens”, directed by James
Cameron of ‘Terminator’ fame,
takes the original horror/science fic-
tion ‘‘Alien”’ and turns it into a futur-
sitic platoon combat romp reminis-
cent of old John Wayne films. The in-
teresting, and relieving, twist,
though, is that this film does not
wallow in the current genre of big-
bicep machismo, but rather shows
that sensitive emotions can be more
powerful than brute force. Cameron
models his doomed marine platoon
on the Vietnam example of superior
technological firepower not stopping
a determined enemy,

“Aliens” picks up with Sigourney
Weaver being rescued from her
space shuttle after hibernating in
hyper-sleep for 57 years. No time is
lost, however, in sending her back to
the newly inhabited planet — a planet
with an alien vessel filled with eggs

only a alien mother could love. In-
deed, Freud would have a heyday
with the maternal emotions por-
trayed in the film as Sigourney
Weaver becomes attached to a cute
girl-the planet’s sole surviving col-
onist. Meanwhile, all the hulking
marines meet their doom to aliens
whose intelligence is fatally under
estimated.

Supporting performances are
given by Michael Biehn (‘‘The Ter-
minator’’) as Hicks — the cool and
level-headed marine corporal — and
Paul Reiser as Burke — the company
representative and space yuppie who
will literally sacrifice anything to
make money for himself. Lance Hen-
nleson portrays Bishop, the android,
who shows much improvement over
the murderous android of the earlier
film.

Other performances are _inten-
tionally cliched and amusing, such as
the ‘“‘by the book’’ lieutenant, the
tough veteran sergeant, and Buc
Paxton (‘‘Weird Science’) as Hud-
son, the cowardly private who ex-
presses the audience’s ‘‘get the hell
out of there’ attitude.

So if you were one of the few
Americans to miss ‘‘Aliens’’ this
summer, definately take advantage
of it this coming week, but do try to
remember the ideas of the original so
as to fully appreciate this worthy se-
quel, sorare in modern film.

Committee
suggests

new lights

By MATHEW HORRIDGE
Assistant News Editor

 

 

The Washington and Lee Athletic
Department is considering the idea
of lighted tennis courts, the Ex-
ecutive Committee said during its
meeting Monday.

Senior representative Baltzer Le-
Jeune said he brought the suggestion
of lighted courts to Director of
Athletics William D. McHenry last
week.

McHenry told LeJeune that al-
though lights for the lower tennis
courts had been considered in the
past two year’s budgets, no money
was set aside this year due to the ex-
pense of the new athletic fields near

Liberty Hall. McHenry estimated the
cost of lighted courts at $20,000, said
LeJeune.

LeJeune said McHenry suggested
students give their requests for
lighted courts to University Presi-
dent John D. Wilson, a move which
may attract more attention from the
administration.

EC President Shayam Menon ask-
ed EC members to poll for student’s
opinions about lighted courts.

In other EC action:

Fifteen organizations turned in
budget requests for consideration at
next week’s budget hearing.

The budget hearing will be at 6:20
p.m. on Tuesday, according to EC
Vice President Brandt Surgner.

The Student Activities Board, after
returning over $5,000 to the EC last
year, has requested $7,000 less than it
did last year. The Political Review
has asked for $1,000 less than last
year’s request. The Hockey Club,
Contact and the Film Society also
have decreased budget requests.

The Ring-tum Phi, the Journal of
Science and the fencing team have
increased their budget requests over
last year’s.

Four new organizations — the
Rowing Club, the East Lex Lacrosse
Club, Club Lacrosse and the
Women’s Forum — have submitted
budget requests.

Four organizations were granted
extensions for their budget requests,
according to Surgner. The Calyx, the
Independent Union, the International
Club and Mock Convention were
given until Monday to submit their
requests.

Junior class president
arrested on misdemeanors

 

By MATHEW HORRIDGE
Assistant News Editor

 

Junior class president Michael
Henry was charged with assault and
battery and obstructing justice after
throwing a cup of beer on a Lexington
police officer this weekend.

Officer Phil Joines was struck with
a cup of beer at 1:45 a.m. while he
and another officer were standing on
the porch of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
fraternity house on East Washington
Street, according to police reports.

“T was standing by the window and
Saw cops...and for no reason in the
world, I did it [threw the cup of
beer],’’ Henry said.

When he went to bed later, Henry
said he ‘‘started thinking about what
I'd done,”’ and realized the act was a
“mindless, disrespectful thing to
do.”’

That evening SAE president

Cooper Crawford and Henry went to
the police station to advise Joines
that Henry was responsible for
throwing the beer.

“We talked for about 20 minutes,”’
Henry said. “I told him I was very
sorry.”

Henry was arrested Sunday night
and charged with the two misde-
meanors. He was released on a sum-
mons and has a trial date set for Nov.
18.

“I do agree with them that it is
something that needs to be handled in
court,” Henry said. “‘I just screwed
up.”

In other police news:

eSenior Nicholas Komas reported
that someone took his wallet contain-
ing $160 in cash from his room in the
Woods Creek Apartments Sept. 13.

Joclyn Wilson, who was visiting
Komas at the apartment, saw a male
suspect in the apartment that morn-
ing.

University Proctor Charles F.
“Murph” Murray showed Wilson a
Lexington High School yearbook and
she identified a juvenile male.

The wallet was replaced on Komas’
dining room table Sept. 19 without the
cash.

eFreshman Ben Lett reported that
someone entered his unlocked
Graham-Lees dormitory room and
removed an $800 Cartier watch.

The watch was reported taken
Sept. 13 sometime between noon and
6 p.m. from the top of Lett’s
refrigerator. Police have no
witnesses or suspects in the case.

Sophomore John Maxwell re-
ported that someone took two tapes
and a wallet containing vehicle

box of his 1973 Scout.

The items were valued at $20.

IFC meets —
with police

 

By ERICK KIECKHEFER
Staff Reporter

 

Fraternity presidents and other
representatives met with Lexington
Chief of Police L.O. Sutton and City
Manager Joseph King to discuss
noise violations, underage drinking
and fraternities’ role in the com-
munity at last Thursday’s Inter-
fraternity Council meeting.

Some of the same fraternities at
this meeting were warned and later
cited for breaking noise violation
rules last weekend.

A meeting between the city and the
fraternities is held annually for the
city to explain its expectations of
fraternity conduct throughout the
school year.

Sutton explained the city’s rules on
noise permits. ‘‘Amplified sound,”
such as bands and loud stereos, is
prohibited without a noise permit,
Sutton said. Although most permits
are valid only until 11:00 p.m., Sutton
said he has been issuing ones that
last until midnight with the under-
standing it ‘‘takes time for the band
and noise to wind down.”’

Sutton outlined other Lexington
policies regarding noise violations.
“Continued unnecessary or unusual
noise or sound cannot become an an-
noyance to others,’’ Sutton said. The
noise from horns, signals and radios
must not travel more than 50 feet
from where it originates, he said:

Sutton also talked about the new
Alcohol Beverage Control Board

INSIDE

Opinion, page 2:

rules making only those born after
July 2, 1966 legal to drink. He said he
does not approve of underage drink
ing and voiced his concern to the
students. ‘‘Fraternities need to keep
it under control and use caution; they
should be aware of their respon-
sibilities,” Sutton said.

The regional ABC representative,
Roger Stevens, did not come to the
meeting as expected. Sutton said a
meeting between himself and the
representatives from the fraternities
was designed ‘‘to help guide them to
a problem-free year.”’

Washington and Lee has seventeen
fraternities, most located near
private residential homes.

Several parties with bands were
shut down Saturday night because of
noise complaints about fraternity
houses on Washington Street, Sutton
said.

Police officers started shutting
down parties at 12:30 a.m. Sunday
morning on Washington Street, Lee
Avenue and in the Henry Street
fraternity area called ‘‘Red Square.”’
Warnings and citations were given to
several houses.

Alan Scarisbrick, president of Kap-
pa Sigma fraternity, said he under-
stood the police action this weekend.
“Chief Sutton was just doing his job;
it’s the law and he has an obligation,”
he said.

Despite the problem of the
weekend, Sutton said he thinks the
year is off to a good start. ‘It could
be better, but it could be worse,’’ he
said. After Rush ends next week, Sut
ton does not anticipate any more pro
blems, he said.

Lexington offers new hotel and ‘fun’ ideas for tourists
Visitor Center offers guide

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Entertainment Editor

 

Who says there’s nothing to do in
Lexington?

Not us. Why, not only can one im-
merse himself in the rigors of study
in this town, but one can also im-
merse himself in the rigors of
tourism. This, if you’ll remember, is
Historic Lexington. Robert E. Lee,
Stonewall Jackson ... Let’s face it,
Lexington has fun written all over it.

There are some people, however,
who need a little help finding fun
things to do. When it comes to fun,
the place to go is the Lexington
Visitor Center on Washington Street.
There, one can find information con-
cerning tours, carriage rides, direc-
tions to Lee Chapel — you name it.

But for those cynics who say, “Aw,
I’ve seen all that’? — don’t despair.
The Visitor Center also offers a
pamphlet for the Exquisitely Bored
called ‘109 Ways To Enjoy Yourself
In Lexington and Rockbridge County
Virginia.”

And I bet you didn’t even know
there were 109 ways to have fun in
this town.

Some of the brochure’s suggestions
are related to Washington and Lee
and others mention Lexington’s
history, festivals and other features.
The brochure can be picked up at the
Visitor Center if you are really
curious. But if you want only the
highlights, we present a sampling, in

the brochure’s words’ of the more
unusual ways to find fun in Lex-
ington.

¢ Eat with the college students at
either Washington and Lee Universi-
ty or Virginia Military Institute.

e Explore the ruins of Liberty
Academy. It was the predecessor of
Washington and Lee University.

¢ Take your children to the Natural
Bridge Zoo and let them pet a wild
anima!

¢ See the National Historic Land-
mark cadet barracks at Virginia
Military Institute and wander the
campus where Ronald Reagan’s
movie “Brother Rat’ was filmed.
The movie was premiered at Lex-
ington’s State Theatre.

¢ Find the watering trough that
once refreshed General Robert E.
Lee’s horse, Traveller, and General
Stonewall Jackson’s horse, Little
Sorrel.

e See the wonderful texture of the
statue done by Edward Valentine of
Robert E. Lee at Lee Chapel and be
surprised by the size of his boots.

¢ Watch the precision of a horse
show on the Southern Seminary
Junior College campus.

e Attend a meeting of the Rock-
bridge Arts Guild and find out how
artists doit.

« See if you can march around the
12-acre parade ground on the campus
of Virginia Military Institute. It is the
oldest state-supported military col-
lege in the nation.

e Join the students and play your
favorite video game at a local
resturant.

The new Comfort Inn Hotel is on Route 11.

New hotel
debuts in

Lexington

 

By STACY MORRISON
Staff Reporter

 

Lexington’s active tourist industry
and college weekends have promptec
a company to build another hotel ir
the small college city.

The Comfort Inn, located on Route
11, opened in the last week of Augus
and is doing business now

Craig Andersen, general manage
of the Lexington Comfort Inn said the
decision to build another hotel in Lex
ington was based on two factors: the
future opening of Interstate 64 anc
the large weekends at the area col
leges, such as Homecoming at Wash
ington and Lee and the Virgini:
Military Institute.

Although the opening of the ir
terstate had been set for this year, i
appears that the highway will n
open until next year.

But the college weekends ar
continuing as always. The Comfo:
Inn was booked for Parent
Weekend, Nov. 7, 8, and 9, thre
hours after opening. The inn wa
booked for Homecoming, Oct. 17 a1
18, the day after opening

No parking

While shopping for cars this summer, one of my major con-
siderations was to find a very small and narrow car. Why? I
knew I would be returning to Lexington and W&L and the
land of no parking.

This is certainly not a new problem. The lack of spaces for
student parking and the vigor with which the Lexington
Police hand out traffic tickets are legendary. Several alumni
from my hometown warned me of the parking problem
before I came to W&L. In fact, one of my first memories of
W&L was trying to negotiate the Corral, that bizarre parking
lot at the base of the hill, desperate to park so I wouldn’t be
late for my interview.

Returning to W&L this September (in my new small and
narrow car), one of the first greetings heard from the faculty
was not the typical ‘‘Hi! How was your summer?’’, but “Oh
no! The students are back! There goes all the parking!”’

With the added obstacle of the new dorm construction, the
parking is more confusing than ever. Access to lower lots has
been heavily curtailed. Students parking behind the gym or
near the old train depot should be issued maps to navigate the
gaping holes and constuction equipment. When the freshmen
and their parents arrived, the construction created a
nightmare. Several parents parked by the Commerce School
only to find that their son or daughter was to move into Davis
Dormitory. The W&L security was called upon to direct traf-
fic so parents wouldn’t run head on into one another on the
one lane area that spans the constuction ditch.

Another parking obstacle is the infamous Corral. I know
several students who have dented their cars on the concrete
and wood contraptions that line the Corral. (Just what pur-
pose do those things serve other than to batter your car?)
Creative parking should be offered as an elective, or at least
aP.E.

The Lexington Traffic Police is a force to be reckoned with.
I’ve seen more than one student running down the Colonnade
to move his car. The police in their outboard motor “‘traffic-
mobiles” mercilessly hand out traffic tickets. (The Lex-
ington City budget must contain a large allotment for chalk.
The revenue is generated, no doubt, from traffic tickets. )

The upperclassmen and faculty do have a hard time find-
ing a parking spot, it’s true. But the worst parking by far is
that for freshmen. ‘‘Where do I park?’’, asked one freshman
during orientaion. An upperclassman answered vaguely,
‘Over that’a way,” waving toward Natural Bridge. During a
storm last year, a tree fell on a freshman’s car, but wasn’t
jiscovered until later the next day by a security officer
scouting what is referred to as the “‘back forty.” It’s common
0 hear among freshmen ‘‘I’m going to get my car. I’ll meet
/ou in twenty minutes.”

There is a problem with parking space. There isn’t enough
ind what there is isn’t accessed very easily. I hope after com-
letion of the new dorm (which will result in more students
rying to park near campus), that some consideration will be

Reader sees the University as home

 

MY VIEW
By John Pensec

 

It was with mixed emotions that I
returned to Lexington almost three
weeks ago. I was certainly glad to
start my senior year, but with that
commencement there was the reali-
zation that, in a short time, another
commencement would send me out
from the world of academia. That
thought is enough to send my
stomach plunging.

While only the passage of time will
give us the objectivity to judge our
years at Washington and Lee, I think
we are each in a position to judge, to

some degree, the University itself. It
is a rare student that becomes an in-
delible part of this university, but
Washington and Lee does become, to
a greater or lesser extent, a part of
each one of us.

The University is guided by the
Honor System. If that system works
the way it should, not only are our
four years guided by it, but our entire
lives as well. It is a comfort to think
that the ideals present in the White
Book are also present across the
country, from boards of directors of
corporations to the United States
Supreme Court.

The Honor System is one way the
University touches our lives; there
are others.

Those of you who were here last

year may remember a column I
wrote shortly before Christmas. In it
I said that Washington and Lee was
not home. I was wrong. Using the
definition of home given in grammar
school, I thought a person could have
only one home and only one family.
This is not true. A home is wherever
one feels comfortable and at ease,
and a family is people with whom one
feels at home. The Washington and
Lee community fits both definitions.

But just as I was wrong in defining
home, it is easy for one to mistakenly
define a university. It is not just a
group of buildings in which classes
are taught. A university is comprised
of people, teachers and students,
each of whom love what they are do-
ing. There are some professsors

LETTERS

Fraternity protests facts of Phi editorial

whose love of their subject is match-
ed only by their love of teaching and »
of passing their love of specific sub-
jects on to their students. Students
are also teachers in the sense that
they bring fresh ideas to those sub-
jects.

I don’t know how much I have
taught people over thé past three
years, if anything. I do know,
however, that I have léarned a lot. As
I witness autumn in the Shenandoah
Valley for the last time, I will think
about Washington and Lee and how
much I will miss this university. But
I will also think of ways in which I
can pass on to others what I have
learned here and thereby live up to
the ideals on which this university is
based.

fraternity ignored. This was not the case.
In a meeting with the Phi editors, last week,

claimed that the editorial was “her opinion.”
Granted, an editorial is an opinion, Miss Dunne,

her free rein to execute a rather melodramatic

Opinion. Most readers who were here the week-
end before last can discern the lack of in-
vestigative skills involved in assembling the
editorial; unfortunately, those who were not here
probably couldn’t have the same perspective.
For the sizable number of parents, teachers and
alumni who read The Ring-tum Phi, the editorial
presents a shallow, indictment of a “callous”
fraternity that refused to help a severly injured
freshman. A readable editorial is a desirable
goal, a goal so desirable to Miss Dunne, it seems,

 

In an unfortunate accident last week, a
freshman fell at the SAE house. His injuries
were minor, but the repercussions from the inci-
dent were a cause for concern for many mem-
bers of the W&L community. The purpose of this
letter is threefold: to clarify the facts of the inci-
dent, to question the Phi’s handling of it and to
ask for some understanding of the pressures that
all fraternities here are finding themselves

The facts of the front page story are accep-
table. The editorial, however, leaves much to be
desired. The ffeshman did fall and scrape his
head. No blood ‘‘oozed”’ from his ear, however.
The cut was a small one about two inches in front
of his ear. The parties did ‘interrupt their
reveries”’ to help. Several SAE’s furnished
blankets and called the ambulance. The editorial
suggests that the VMI students were the fresh-
man’s saviors. In actuality their help was of-
ficious, condescending and for the most part un-
necessary. Their overbearing presence was a big
reason for SAE’s seeming apathy. After the am-
bulance arrived, the VMI students were thanked
and sent on their way. Rush parties are closed to
all but the W&L community and their guests. All
fraternity parties are closed to VMI students
without written invitations. Finally, the VMI
students were not putting themselves at risk to
be on fraternity property. When they first saw
the fallen freshman they came from the adjacent
fraternity’s front yard approximately three or
four minutes after the accident. The editorial
makes it seem as if the VMI students witnessed
the fall, and then placed themselves in danger to

Miss Dunne, the author of the editorial in ques-
tion, refused to run a correction of the facts. She

however, was not there. Absence, it seems, gave
piece of muckraking by assembling the bits of

gossip she heard on the Hill into a “‘story.”” SAE
asked only that she correct her facts, not her

that she is willing to engage in National Enquirer
type journalism to achieve it. The W&L com-
munity does not deserve this kind of writing, The
Phi mishandled its representation of the inci-
dent.

This mishandling should not be ignored. This
year marks the culmination of several years of
pressure on fraternities. The new drinking laws
make it hard for fraternities to continue
anything resembling the social life that they are
used to. In this time of transition, the last thing
W&L’s strong fraternity system needs is a
crusading overzealous student newspaper
waiting to twist the knife in any vulnerable
fraternity’s back. The W&L community has
every right to be informed. Scandal sheet jour-
nalism however, does not qualify as information.
The Phi owes it to the W&L community at large,
and especially the fraternity system to refrain
from such tactics in the future.

Student reacts to Honor System

To the editors:

When I arrived at Washington and Lee two
weeks ago, I immediately came face to face with
the University’s Honor System, To someone who
is first making contact with the system, it can be
a curious experience. I wondered if I could truly
leave my possessions unattended. Each time |
locked my dorm room, I wondered if I was doubt-
ing the Honor System by worrying that my
stereo, etc. might not be safe.

Last Sunday I inadvertently left two shirts
hanging in the laundry room. When, on the
following Thursday, I realized they were miss-
ing, I hurried to the laundry room and found
them there, untouched. This incident inspired
me to be proud of my new school and the people
here. I eagerly told my parents and friends at
other colleges that the Washington and Lee com-
munity really was made up of honorable people.

That pride later turned to dismay and anger
when I found that a pair of stereo headphones
had been stolen from my carrel in the University
Library. (Because I purchased the headphones
abroad, I can neither replace them nor provide
information about the foreign brand name. Thus,
it is useless to report the theft.) I was disillusion-
ed and embarrassed that the ideal community |
had held up to parents and friends was not so

"ideal after all.

After placing everything in perspective, I still

am proud of the W&L community; I believe that
the Honor System is highly successful and that
the vast majority of the people in the Washington
and Lee community are honorable. I am writing
this letter, however, with hopes that others
might learn from my experience and consider
ae precautions to protect their personal pro-

Reader corrects ‘Rush Guide’

To the editors:

I would like to make a fairly significant correc-
tion to Mr. Marshall Boswell’s article, ‘A Guide
to Rush 1986.”’ In his article, Mr. Boswell stated
that, ‘A bid is good for one year.” This state-
ment is simply incorrect. The length or duration
of which a bid is considered ‘‘good”’ is solely up
to the decision of each individual fraternity. Bids
vary greatly from house to house. The best way
to find out about bids is to question the houses
that interest you.

Student finds cartoon correct

To the editors:

Congratulations on the cartoon carried on the
Sept. 18 edition’s Opinion page. It presents im-
portant insight into the recent rash of alcohol
abuse by some members of the freshman class.

The depiction of those students as puppets is
accurate; many of them are Puppets of peer
pressure who seek acceptance from upper-
classmen and a chance to prove their “sophis-
tication.”’

Unfortunately, few of these students realize
that they need not capitulate to peer pressure in
order to be accepted. At several frat parties, I
politely refused the offers of alcohol, and I was
not derided for my decision.

Hopefully, more people will come to under-
stand that drinking is not proof of sophistication.
There are students at Washington and Lee who
do not feel that intoxication is fun and who
believe in standing by their convictions, No one
should allow themselves to be pressured into
drinking if they do not wish to do so.

parades and events from the annual Tournament of
Roses and Macy’s Thanksgiving Day parades to small-
town celebrations.

There are three traveling eight-horse Clydesdale
hitch teams, based in St. Louis, Mo.; Merrimack, N.H.;
and Romoland, Calif. The three teams log approximate-

To be selected for one of the three hitches, a horse
must be at least three years of age, stand approximate-
ly 18 hands high, be bay in color, have four white stock-
ing feet, a blaze of white on the face and have a black
mane and tail.

NEWS BRIEFS

Two chosen as Calyx co-editors

Festival in June 1984, the Vienna Schubert Trio has ap-
peared at several international festivals. The trio offers
a repertoire of the major works of piano literature,
works from the time of Schubert, and compositions
from the first half of the 20th century.

The Masterplayers of Lugano, a chamber orchestra
of 17 of Europe’s finest musicians, will perform on
Tuesday, Oct. 21.

Directed by the distinguished Swiss conductor
Richard Schumacher, the ensemble has given over
1,000 concerts in Europe and North and South America.
The group features a string section whose members
play exclusively on instruments of the old famous
Italian lutteur school — Amati, Stradivarius,
Guarnerius, and Grancico, among others.

Renaissance music will be featured on Wednesday,
Nov. 19, when Music For A While performs. Founded in
1970, Music For A While is one of America’s most ac-
claimed ensembles devoted to the performance of
Medieval and Renaissance music. The group’s three
musicians are artists-in-residence at Sarah Lawrence
College and have performed throughout the United
States and Canada.

On Tuesday, Jan. 20, Grant Johannesen, one of
America’s finest pianists, will give a solo recital. In a
career which spans 40 years, he has performed fre-
quently with the great American orchestras, being the
only soloist chosen for two tours each of the New York
Philharmonic and the Cleveland Orchestra. His many
tours abroad have prompted the U.S. State Department
to comment again and again on his superior abilities as
a cultural ambassador of the United States.

In continuing its varied program, the Concert Guild
will present Jan Degaetani, mezzo-soprano, and Gilbert
Kalish, pianist, on Tuesday, Feb. 24. Their pro-
grams, which have brought them such renown, cover
four centuries of music. They have performed together
for 20 years.

Ending the season on Tuesday, Mar. 17, will be the
Stradivari String Quartet. No strangers to Lexington,
the quartet has performed in Lexington on several oc-
casions following extended international tours.

Professor does Maine research

Gerard M. Doyon, professor of art history at
Washington and Lee University, spent part of the sum-
mer in Maine conducting research funded by the
Museum of Art of Ogunquit on the coast of Maine.

Doyon’s research concentrated on the drawings and
paintings of Henry Strater. The results of Doyon’s work
will appear this winter in the Bulletin of the Museum of
Art of Ogunquit.

In addition to his research, Doyon also gave an il-
lustrated slide lecture at the museum. The lecture was
entitled “The Realistic Art of Henry Strater: Selected
Paintings and Drawings from 1922 to Present.”’ Doyon
organized a show of Strater’s drawings and paintings at
W&L’s duPont Gallery during the last academic year.

A graduate of St. Anselm's College with a Ph.D. from
Boston University, Doyon has been a member of the
Washington and Lee faculty since 1968.

 

New carrel

 

By VALERIE PIERSON
Staff Reporter

 

Many upperclassmen can recall
the days when simply placing a book
or belongings on a certain University
Library carrel meant it was claimed.
But after a number of disputes last
year over ownership of specific car-
rels, a librarian developed a system
whereby students and librarians can
determine just who has claimed
which carrel.

The new carrel-claiming system
requires a student to read and sign a
set of conditions on numbered forms
which were placed on each carrel,
according to Peggy Hays, the public
services and reference lirarian who
developed the system. With these
forms, Hays said, she can keep a
record of who uses a specific carrel.

These claim forms were placed on
every carrel in the library on the
morning of the first day of classes,
when claiming could begin. When the
rush of eager carrel-claimers
entered the library, they were in-
structed to fill out the forms and
return them to the librarians.

According to Hays, a crowd of
more than 50 students, both up-
perclassmen and freshmen, were
waiting outside the library’s doors to
claim a carrel. Freshman Gena
Hauser, who was in the crowd, said
when the doors were opened, people
ran in search of the carrel of their
choice. By 8.a.m., she said, it was dif-
ficult to determine which carrels, if
any, were still available.

Hays said that there was no need
for the morning’s rush and that there
were over 200 carrels left unclaimed
the next day.

 

 

The conditions on the claim form
restrict the freedom some students
exercised with carrels in the past.
Moving the carrels is prohibited and
the carrels must be used somewhat
frequently to show that the carrel is
being put to use. If a carrel looks as if
it has not been used in three con-
secutive weeks, it may be assigned to
someone else, Hays said.

Several problems arose in the first
few days under the new carrel-claim-
ing policy. Some students picked up
the forms from the carrels but failed

to return them to the librarians.
These carrels may have been assign-
ed to another student.

Some upperclassmen did not know
about the new policy despite the
notices on each floor of the library.
Heated arguments arose when these
upperclassmen found students work-
ing at the carrels they thought they
had claimed. Many of these argu-
ments occurred Monday night, when
the day librarians had left without
giving instructions to the night
librarian.

Student interest fuels W&L Jazz Ensemble

 

By EVELYN M. FAHY
Staff Reporter

 

The Jazz Ensemble is a little-
known, but nevertheless vital music
organization here on campus. The
ensemble plays all types of jazz,
ranging from Aaron Copeland to Diz-
zie Gillespie.

Formed about 15 years ago, the

Jazz Ensemble’s membership sur-
vives on student interest. In the past,
the group has had as many as 22
musicians. Currently, the Jazz
Ensemble has, according to director
Robert Stewart, many excellent
musicians, but is in need of a bass
player and brass players.

Those interested should sit in on
rehearsals, which are held every
Thursday at 5 p.m. on the third floor
of duPont Hall.

While no firm schedule has been

prepared for the coming season, the
Jazz Ensemble will play at Parents’
Weekend and will most likely per-
form at the Robert E. Lee birthday
dance held at the Greenbrier in White
Sulfur Springs, W.Va.

In addition, the group traditionally
travels during spring break. These
travels have included Caribbean
cruises, trips to Miami and an ap-
pearance at the 1984 World’s Fair in
New Orleans. The Jazz Ensemble
also holds concerts on campus.

and no liquor had

any effect on the

this past weekend?

Jessica Reynolds, sophomore,

as drunk on beer as you can on li-

beer to compensate for the lack of
liquor.”

Melanie

been more fun if there had been
alcohol.”

 

John Scannapieco, senior, Tex-
as: ‘Not having liquor at the par-
ties took out some of the exotic-
ness of the Rush parties. Usually
you have Bahamas parties or
those kinds of parites. It put the
fraternities on an equal level,
because now one can’t go out and
spend a lot on liquor.”’

unranked Harvard 9-1, they lost to
No. 11 Navy, 15-5, and to No. 15 Iona,
10-4.

Against Navy, their first game in
the tournament, Remillard said that
the team “did not come ready to
play.”’ He said that the team did not
get into Annapolis until 40 minutes
before match time. But he added, “I
had no problem with that because we
stayed [at W&L] until classes were
done.”

In the Iona match, despite the loss,
the team showed marked improve-
ment over last year’s performance
when they were beaten soundly, 17-2.

“There will be peaks and valleys
for a while,” said Remillard. ‘‘But,
that’s what a young team is going to

University of Richmond.

Last year, Richmond defeated the
Generals 13-4 in the championship
game of this same tournament.

“Richmond is a team with mostly
seniors,’ said Remillard. ‘‘We have
a lot of respect for them, it’s a big
rivalry, but we’re still good friends.”’

But Remillard added, ‘I think it
will be Richmond vs. W&L in the
championship game.” He continued,
“We're a much improved team, we
can hardly wait to play Richmond.”’

said Fallon, pointing out that the
Wasps had only five plays from
scrimmage in the entire first period.
“Our offense has got to feel very good
about being able to do that against a
good defense.”’

Fallon also praised the Generals’
aggressive defensive effort, noting
that the Wasps fumbled six times.
Fallon observed that, were it not for
“a few great runs” by Wasp back
Sandy Rogers, the score could have
been considerably closer.

“The score wasn’t really indicative
of how well we played, and I hope our
{players} can rebound from the
loss,”’ said Fallon. ‘‘You have to put
that loss behind you...and get ready
for your next opponent.’’

at Centre, Fallon respects the Col-

Centre lost only one of last year’s of-
fensive starters to graduation. Their
offensive scheme is based on the op-
tion, said Fallon, with a sprint draw
and an occasional pass off of play ac-
tion.

Defensively, Fallon said the Col-
onels remind him of Emory and
Henry. “‘They are not quite as large,
and maybe not quite as fast, but they
do swarm to the ball.” They are a lit-
tle young, he added, but ‘‘have done
well against both of their opponents
so far.’’ Centre defeated Rhodes,
14-9, in their season opener and
crushed Maryville last week, 36-14.

Repossess the Fridge

There comes a time when someone must be put in their place. You
know what I’m talking about. That certain situation in which someone
becomes just too cool for their own good.

Defensive end William Perry (ah yes, the Fridge) of the Chicago
Bears is that certain someone who comes to my mind. The scene is St.
Louis’ Busch Memorial Stadium and the Cards and Bears are fighting
it out ina PRESEASON game. The Fridge has just put the clamps on
the Cardinal’s quarterback Neil Lomax. Cool, a sack for Fridge and
some high fives on the way back to the huddle. But hold on just a sec-
ond. Perry is not content with holding Lomax until the whistle blows.
Instead, he twirls the defenseless QB in his arms and (get ready
Hulkamania fans) body slams Lomax onto (or should we say ‘‘into’’?)
the artificial turf.

What's that you say? What are you Shades, a wimp? Don’t you know
that football is a violent game played by violent people? The fans want
to see bodies flying and helmets crashing and players smashing each
other into oblivion.

Well, I agree (not that I’m a wimp but that football is not a sport for
the timid). I get fired up just like the next guy when someone gets
knocked on his butt. However, what Perry did brings back to mind the
Jack Tatum-Darry] Stingley tragedy from a few years back (for those
of you who have forgotten, look in Webster’s under ‘“‘paralyzed’’).

Take this other example into consideration. Two weeks ago, the
Bears and Philadelphia were tied late in the fourth quarter. Eagles’
QB Ron Jaworski faded back, passed the ball and then got smothered
by the Fridge. The result? No flag; Jaworski doesn’t know what city
he’s in; and Chicago wins in OT, 13-10.

I used to like William Perry. There’s a certain sense of anticipation
in wondering if the Fridge will line up at running back, receiver, or
even QB (head coach Mike Ditka has entertained the idea — see Super
Bowl XX). When he concentrates on playing football, Perry’s size,
strength and speed make him one of the dominating defensive linemen
in the game. But it’s when I see him shoving, taunting and pointing
fingers at opposing players that I’m not impressed.

It is fun to laugh at his weight, his nickname and that Letterman-like
grin. He has risen from being labled a ‘‘wasted draft choice” to
becoming one of the most recognized and admired athletes around. I
enjoy viewing him in advertisements and on TV talkshows, but I would
much rather see him slamming down McDLT’s than other human be-
ings.

Cheap shots and unnecessary roughness are just that; unnecessary.
Rules are rules and are there for a reason. It is those few in-
dividuals who think they are above the rules who can ruin the fun for
the rest of us. NFL football is a dangerous game and players get hurt
every week; but it would be a shame if someone was seriously injured
because of the overaggressiveness of another.

When William Perry first arrived on the scene, the media and the
fans thought the Fridge was the best thing that could happen for the
sport, and I agree. Now I’m not so sure.

NOTES: NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle fined Perry $2,500 for his
unnecessary slam of Lomax, small change for a guy who grosses over
1.5 million a year. I wonder what Rozelle would have done had Lomax
been laid up in a hospital bed with spinal injuries?... From Sports Il-
lustrated: University of Georgia offers a course entitled ‘Psychology
of Satisfaction.’’ According to some athletes who have taken the class,
you have to only show up once or twice in order to obtain an A: thus the
title... A Philadelphia newspaper listed the NFL teams in alphabetical
order along with their preseason roster cuts. The list went something
like “‘Minnesota, New Orleans, Oakland?”’... Another tidbit from the
wonderful world of sports journalism. A Washington Post sportswriter
recently wrote a story on Walter Payton and ended one of Payton’s
quotes with ‘‘said Sweetness.’’ Give mea break...

See it to believe

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Entertainment Editor

 

Got this record here by these guys
named the Casuals. Seems there’s
this fella in the band, calls himself
Johnny Sportcoat or something. Spif-
fy little name they got: Johnny Sport-
coat and the Casuals. Or is it The
Casuals, featuring Johnny Sport-
coat?

Don’t matter, really. I seen these
guys live a buncha times. Good band.
Had a great time — drank a little
beer, talked to some chicks, even got
to dance with a few of ’em. Ole
Johnny Sportcoat always sez, ‘‘Hey,
the drunker you get, the better we
sound!’’ Some bands are just like
that, you know?

Now this record of theirs, ‘‘State-
wide Joyride,” is something else en-
tirely. See, the first time I listened to
it, I knew there was something
wrong; thing was, I just couldn’t
seem to place it. These fellas can
play all right — hey, Bryan Yates’s
about as good a guitarist as yer gon-
na find, anywhere. No, that wasn’t it.
The songs weren’t all that bad, either
— nothing that’s gonna earn ’em a
Nobel, you know, but nifty enuff, I
guess. It just sounded like there was
something, someone... missing...

Yup, that was the whole problem.
There was no crowd, you see? No

beer to drink, no girls to talk to,
nobody to dance with. I mean, these
guys need a roomful of people to
sound really good. Listening to this
album is kinda like listening to MTV
with the picture turned off.

Okay, what about the songs, right?
Weil, like I said, there ain’t anything
wrong with ‘em. It’s just that I kept
getting the feeling I’d heard ’em all
somewhere else. “Under Pressure’
is the best original 'cos it rocks the
best. Second in line is one called
“Man Smart (Woman Smarter)”’ —
which oughta make a coupla W&L
fellas squirm.

What do the songs sound like? Aw,
I don’t know... Kinda like Elvis
Costello in a good mood, I guess. Or
Buddy Holly after a coupla drinks.
Real classic Doo Wop, fraternity par-
ty stuff.

So, that’s about all I can say about
“Statewide Joyride.’’ I would have
really liked to have fallen in love with
this album on account of I really
get a bang out of the Casuals. All this
means, of course, is that the record is
not nearly as good as the real thing.
Now, if ya get a chance to see these
guys live, don’t miss ‘em. Johnny
Sportecoat can milk a crowd like
nobody’s business. Put simply, the
Casuals are one terrific rock and roll
band. Ya just gotta see it to believe it
is all. Some bands are just like that,
you know?

If folk tales - and good ones at that -
are your forte, then don’t miss the
story of “‘Red Fox/Second Hangin’,”’
to be performed under the stars this
Saturday in a one-night-only produc-
tion at Lime Kiln Arts’ Theatre. Show
time is 8 p.m.

Red Fox was an outlaw, lawman,
preacher, ladies’ man and maybe
murderer. For the past decade his
story, told by Don Baker, Gary
Slemp and Frankie Taylor, has cap-
tured the imagination of audiences
all over America — from tiny towns
with funny names like Grundy and
Slap Out to huge cities with not-so-
funny names like New York, Wash-
ington and Las Vegas.

Don Baker, Lime Kiln’s producing
director who co-authored, directed
and acts in the show, said the show is
coming to town by popular demand.

“There are a lot of people who
wanted to see it who thought it would
be back this summer,’’ Baker said.

Lime Kiln

“I’ve always wanted to perform the
show outdoors in the fall, when the
clear stars and crackle of wood
smoke in the air carry you back to
the days when families gathered
around the campfires and stoves to
listen and tell tales of long ago.”’
“Red Fox/Second Hangin’ ”’ tells
the story of Doc Taylor, a relative of
Baker’s who was the second man

 

,

gli

sg ll

ever hung in Wise County. The .

meticulously-researched story draws
upon musty old court records,
photographs, newspapers and the
recollections of old-timers to weave
the story not only of Red Fox, but
also of a vanishing way of life in the
mountains.

“The show casts the same kind of
breathless spell that a masterful
teller of ghost tales can induce,” said
the Atlanta Journal.

The New York Times said it is, ‘‘as
stirring for its historical detective
work as for the vanishing art of fron-
tier yarnspinning.’’ -

A limited number of seats is avail-
able for the show. Admission is $9.

‘Students

injured in

accident

 

By SEAN BUGG
Editor

 

At least three Washington and Lee
students were injured this weekend
as a result of a Sunday evening
automobile accident, according to

_ Amblemare Police department re-

ports.
The students, junior Porter Davis,

.. sophomore Julia Kirk, senior Russell
_ Peck and junior Jay St. John, were

involved in the accident while return-

' ing to Lexington from a Charlot-
 tesville restaurant after attending
_ the Foxfield Races earlier that day.

The report said the driver, Peck,
lost control of the 1981 Honda on a

' sharp turn and hit a highway sign on

a median strip. The accident oc-
curred at 9:40 p.m. at the intersec-

' tion of Routes 250 and 240. The car

came to rest on the embankment on
the side of Route 240, the report said.

“It was a one-vehicle accident,”
said police.

Police said that Peck had been
drinking but his ability to drive had
not been impared.

Peck was charged with reckless

, driving, according to police.

Passengers Kirk, Davis and Peck
were injured, police said. The report
made no mention of St. John.

Kirk, Davis and Peck were taken to

_ the University of Virginia Medical

Center. Kirk and Davis were admit-
ted and later released. Peck was
treated and released.

All the passengers were wearing
seat belts, according to the police
report.

Kirk said there were four pas-
sengers in the car at the time of the

" accident. “I think all four occupants

were taken to the hospital to make

’ gure that everything was all right.”’

“None of us sustained very major

" injuries,” she said. “It looks like I

just have some bruises.”’ She said it

’ appears that her bruises were a

result of wearing a lap belt.
Kirk said that Davis stayed over-

night in the medical center, and that
’ she stayed for three nights.

Sd

TT

“TI would like to make this point
that Russ Peck was not drunk, and he
did not receive a DWI,” Kirk said.

Kirk said she thinks the cause of
the accident was ‘“‘wet roads.”’

She said ‘‘of course”’ her professors
were being cooperative as a result of
her situation.

Peck declined to be interviewed on
Wednesday evening.

Kirk said she had experienced car
accidents before. ‘I wouldn’t recom-
mend it,”’ she said.

Demand for court lights rises

 

By SAMUEL FOLEY
Staff Reporter

 

If coach Gary Franke and Ex-
ecutive Committee Representative
Baltzer LeJeune could have it their
way, tennis on the Washington and
Lee campus would not have to end
when the sun sets.

At the last meeting, LeJeune sug-

"gested that lights be installed on the

tennis courts so play could continue
into the evening. ‘Even as a fresh-
man I remember being surprised
that W&L didn’t have lighted tennis

+ courts,” he said.

LeJeune said the idea has been
very well received by the students
and “there has been no adversity at
allsofar.”’

The Executive Committee this
week announced its budget alloca-
tions for student organizations for the
1986-87 school year.

The committee showed how much
each group received out of the
$133,650 total student body alloca-
tions.

The Student Activities Board
received by far the most money, net-
ting $46,000 to use throughout the
year. ‘The purpose of the Student
Activities Board is to provide social,
cultural and recreational activities
aimed at the needs and interests of
the student body,’’ according to the
current Student Handbook.

Second in line for the top alloca-
tions is the Student Bar Association,
which received $22,000. SBA’s func-
tion is ‘‘to serve as liaison between
students and faculty on all matters
relating to activities and operations
of the School of Law,” says the hand-
book. The group also helps to fund the
various Law School publications and
bring speakers to the Law campus.

The Ring-tum Phi, the student
newspaper, and the Calyx, the year-
book, received respectively $18,000
and $15,250.

Two accounts, labeled Executive
Committee Expense and Executive
Committee Fund, received respec-
tively $4,500 and $1,500.

Students paint rooms despite rules

 

ESS
By CHRISTIE CHAMPLIN
Staff Reporter

 

Although it is against university housing policy,
students are making changes in their school-
owned rooms.

Painting, building and the removal of furniture
are prohibited in any of the University Housing
facilities, including Graham-Lees, Gilliam, Baker
and Davis dormitories, the International House,
Chavis House, the Minority Student Association
House, Lee II and Woods Creek Apartments.

Students living in University Housing at W&L
pay a $100 room and security deposit which is
returned at the end of the year if the room passes a
final inspection by the Department of Buildings
and Grounds.

The return of the deposit can be forfeifted by
many violations. However, the largest percentage
of deductions is made for damage to walls which
requires patching and/or painting, replacing
discharged fire extinguishers or the cleaning of
stoves, refrigerators and other kitchen equipment
in the Woods Creek Apartments, said Rober
Mohler, the Director of University Housing.
Damages which necessitate patching and painting
include nail holes, dirt, writing and residue from
tape. Building lofts is also prohibited. University
housing is used in the summer for many summer
programs making it necessary for all of the
restrictions, Mohler said.

This year, students in Woods Creek Apartments
and some dormitories have built lofts and painted
rooms, violations of University rules. The reasons
for these actions include a need for more space

and a dislike for the color scheme.

Sophomore Amy Smith, a resident of Woods
Creek, has built a loft in her room because she
says that there was not enough room without one.
“The rooms are small and I wanted a double bed,”’
says Smith. Friends of hers who lived in Woods
Creek before graduating last year built lofts in
their rooms and did not have to forfeit any of their
$100 deposit.

One sophomore Woods Creek resident said she
thought repainting rooms does no harm to the
apartments. ‘‘We chose to improve the room,” she
said.

“T don’t think there is anything wrong with
painting as long as it is painted tastefully,” said
one of her roommates. They say they keep the
apartment in much better condition than last
year’s residents who left it with badly stained
floors and cracked countertops.

Painting or changing the color of a room is not
allowed because people’s tastes in colors vary so
much, said Mohler. The University does all of the
painting and picks “satisfactory colors which are
adequate for the students’ needs,”’ he said.

If a room is painted by a student, the room will
be repainted during the summer and the student
responsible will be billed. If damage occurs in a
double room the Honor System requires that the
guilty student claim the responsibility and settle
the account.

In Woods Creek Apartments students are re-
sponsible for their individual rooms and the group
is responsible for the common areas, such as the
kitchen and living room.

Many schools, for example, Washington Univer-
sity in St. Louis, Mo., allow their students to

there is a need to light the courts. If
we could just light courts one and
two, we could finish matches that
start or run late. It would also extend
practice time for players with
schedule problems and _ increase
recreational use,”’ he said.

Athletic Director Buck McHenry
said that the athletic department has
requested the lights in its budget for
the last four years but has been told
that the lights do not command a high
enough priority

McHenry added that, ‘Anytime
students exercise their rights in re-
questing things the powers that be
sometimes sit up and take notice.”’

McHenry and Coach Franke both
agree that the lights would be a
benefit to the recreational players
who cannot use the courts during the

tennis team’s practice hours. but

McHenry feels that the university
should light more than just the two
courts if they are going to light any at
all.

It was also suggested that pay
boxes with timers be installed on the
lights so that students who want to
use the courts after dark can insert
quarters and the lights would stay on
for a set period of time.

“I don’t think it would be too much
to ask for players to spend a couple of
quarters to play at night,’”’ Franke
said.

LeJeune agreed, saying he had
seen this done at several other
universities,

LeJeune said the next step for the
idea was for him to present it to EC
President Shayam Menon and from

there it will likely go to University
President John D. Wilson

 

The W &L soce

remodel their rooms. Washington University will
provide the students with paints, brushes, etc. for
the student to paint his room, however, he wants
it, within reason. This type of policy allows the
current resident to paint his room whatever color
he wants and the next occupant is free to paint
over it if he chooses. The school does not fine the
students for the painting.

Mohler also said that there hasn’t been much
trouble with students repainting their rooms in the
past. A few students make requests to change the
color of their rooms and when the requests are
denied some go ahead and pay the fee at the end of
the year.

The majority of students repainting their rooms
occurs in the Woods Creek Apartments. Three
people painted their rooms last year and one re-
quest to paint this year has been denied. The
Superintendant of Buildings and Grounds, J.L. Ar-
thur, commented that the rooms last year were
generally in fair condition and showed improve-
ment over the previous few years.

Lofts are also prohibited except for those which
were built by the University this summer in Davis
dormitory. All of the rooms in Davis, except the
corner rooms, have built-in lofts. If a loft is seen
during an inspection it will be taken apart and the
lumber will be confiscated by the Department of
Buildings and Grounds. There are two inspec-
tions: a spot inspection around Christmas and the
final inspection in the spring. The addition of
small convenience items such as lamps or small
tables is allowed; however, the University feels
that the furniture provided — a bed, a study table,
a chair and a chest of drawers — is adequate for
any student’s needs.

OPINION

The Ring-tum Phi, October 2, 1986

 

Apathetic

One of my biggest pet peeves is apathy, particularly stu-
dent apathy. Student apathy is most notable at football
games. The stands are filled for the first half, yet the only
fans who remain for the whole game are the fans from the op-
posing team. The football team spends many hot afternoons
training for these games. Their only reward seems to be the
recognition they receive from their classmates and the en-
joyment they receive from playing the game. To not care
enough to support your fellow classmates or school seems
pathetic enough, but to get up and leave as one huge mass is
downright rude. It seems to me that the parties could wait
another hour. (Often Saturday night parties after football
games are somewhat of a let-down, most often because
party-goers, who started drinking early in the day, are pass-
ed out by the time the party gets into full swing.) I really
can’t believe that students at W&L don’t care about our
athletic teams (for student apathy is present at all athletic
games, but is most noticable at football games) or the im-
pression our apathy must make on visitors to W&L. I believe
we have reason to be quite embarrassed.

It seems a shame to me that many of the opportunities
W&L provides are wasted. Only at school of this size is it
possible to have an author give more than a typical reading,
that is to say, actually hold a discussion in a classroom set-
ting. Rather than speculate on symbolism, you can actually
ask the author. Unfortunately, very few people attend
readings or lectures (and those who attend usually do so only
because it is required for a class). Despite the fact it is expen-
sive for University to hire the people to speak, it’s just plain
embarrassing to for them to speak to an empty room. Many
plays are presented and various musical groups perform
each year and admission is usually free to the W&L com-
munity, yet it’s considered a big crowd if the place is half full.

Aclosely related aspect of student apathy is the general un-
willingness of anyone on this campus to say what they think
for fear that someone will think worse of them. Often people
come up to me to tell me how they disagreed with my opinion,
yet very few of these people are willing to be quoted or be
held accountable for their opinion. It is highly unlikely that
you will be exiled to Siberia just because your opinion differs
from someone elses. During the past week someone referred
to me as one ‘“‘who b------ the loudest’. Although I do have opi-
nions, I don’t feel I am as vehement in my opinions as com-
pared to many W&L students, and it always surprises me
when someone hesistates to say what they think. It seems
many people want to try to please everyone else and gain
universal acceptance (if such a thing is possible, ) at the sake
of their own individualism.

The problem of student apathy can be changed. I can only
hope that in the coming years it becomes more popular to
support our school and its athletic teams. It would be wonder-
ful to see the kind of school unity and participation that is
generally seen only during Parent’s Weekend or at those
games versus Roanoke College, when the infamous Unknown
Fans make their appearance, at every game. I hope more
people take advantage of the speakers, theatrical produc-
tions, and musical presentations that the University offers.
But most of all, I hope that people will have enough con-
fidence in themselves (and their friends) to realize they
won’t be ostracized if their opinion doesn’t happen to match
everyone else’s.

Enlightening

It was wonderful news to hear that Washington and Lee has
come a step closer to bringing the tennis courts out of the
dark ages with the installation of lights for night play.

One of the only problems with the lights is the suggestion
that players pay for the lighting if they wish to play at night.
Now, it is understandable that there is a large cost involved
installing the system. However, one of the major reasons the
system is needed is that student players do not always have
access to the courts during the day, due to such things as
classes and tennis team practice.

Students playing racquetball, squash, handball or basket-
ball in Warner Center are not charged a quarter or two per
hour to keep the lights on. Students using the track at Wilson
Field are not charged by the lap. So in all fairness, should
tennis players be charged to enjoy their sport? Tennis coach
Gary Franke said that it should not be ‘‘too much to ask”’
from players “‘to spend a couple of quarters to play at night.’’
For some students living on a shoestring budget, though,
those quarters might translate into clean clothes for the next
few days. Should they be left out of a recreational activity
just for that reason?

Basically, the idea of lights for some of the tennis courts is
an excellent one that has been long overdue, with or without
the moneyboxes controlling the lights. We only hope that
those in charge realize some of the contradictions involved in
charging students for the use of lights.

COUNTERPOINT

Sororities : ‘what’s the bigrush??

By Susan C. Lewis
with Keri Hinricks
and Alexa Salzman

As the school year progresses, it is
inevitable that more and more atten-
tion be focused on the question of
whether or not sororities should be
established at W&L. Unfortunately,
many people do not know there is a
group with the opinion that the ques-
tion should be “‘Is now the best time
for sororities?” rather than “How
soon can they be established?”’

After attending a meeting about
sororities last year, some people left
feeling almost dizzy from the
statements that had been made.
Many who indeed do want sororities
sometime in the future felt pressure
and a sense of bewilderment in hear-
ing talk of a Winter Rush. But the
breakneck pace has already been set,
although some people are beginning
to come forward now and say, ‘Wait
a minute. Why the big rush? Maybe
we need to sit back and really talk
this issue through and give everyone
achance to think about it.”

One of the first questions that
comes to mind has to be: ‘‘What le-
gitimate need has been shown for
sororities?”” Any needs shown for
sororities, such as housing, com-
munity service and social events, can

be met just as well - and indeed bet-
ter - by the Women’s Forum. There
are many opportunities for leader-
ship and service to the W&L com-
munity yet to be developed in this
new organization which promotes
unity and cooperation among the
women at W&L in a non-competitive
atmosphere. If sororities are
established, it seems almost certain
that the Women’s Forum will be
much less effective. Until the oppor-
tunities presented by it are fully
taken advantage of, is it fair to aban-
don the Women’s Forum so soon
after its establishment? E
200 women at W&L. Even if all were
involved in the Women’s Forum
-which seems highly unlikely - surely
this small number of women can
work together as a group. After all,
surrounding schools have many
more women than W&L, yet they do
not have sororities. Hollins,
Randolph-Macon Woman’s College,
and Sweet Briar all have about 800
students, and they seem to be able to
work together quite well without
sororities.

Another factor which has to be con-
sidered is how sororities would lead
to an alienation of the surrounding
women’s schools. This shock would
almost seem too much to ask of the
present W&L social system, which
has seen enough change in the past

two years.

Sororities would also seem to
divide women at W&L itself, even as
we strive to get to know and form
bonds with the new freshman class.
They would even serve to increase
the competition which already exists
socially.

It seems only fair to ask, too, what
other school has seen sororities
develop in the second year of
coeducation. Do we now have so
soon, not only the need, but the
means, power, or perhaps even
privilege to ask for sororities so
quickly? Only if the necessary work
and great responsibilities of begin-
ning a sorority are fully understood
can this question be answered.

At first glance, the recent polls con-
cerning sororities appear to be
almost overwhelmingly in favor of
them. But if one looks more closely at
the questions themselves, it becomes
clear that there was little room left
for indecision in these polls. The
questions dealt more with ‘‘Do you
think there should be sororities?”
and not with ‘‘When do you think they
should be established?”’ or simply ‘‘I
haven’t decided yet.”” Probably the
majority of women answered in the
questionnaire that they would partic-
ipate in Winter Rush this year. But
from this simple fact, one cannot
deduce that this is because all women

We are in favor of having national RP
sororities at Washington and Lee |

and opportunities that they could pro- « *

Some people have certain precon- . :
ceptions about what sororities could « f
be such as beer drinking clubs, ex- , :

clusive cliques, and barriers to
women’s unity. The national ‘
sororities that have contacted W&L ; ‘
encourage the immediate benefits of
scholarship and leadership and the
future advantages of national net-
working and career contacts. Em-
phasis is placed on academic ex-
cellence by requiring the main-
tenance of certain grade point
averages for Rush and membership.
Sororities would increase women’s
leadership possibilities on campus
through their elected offices.
Sororities can further promote
motivation by involving its members
in such ways as athletics, community
service, and campus activities. In ad-
dition to making new friends with
varied interests and experiences,
sororities also provide a support
system of peers. The big sister/little
sister program encourages friend-
ship throughout the classes. Sorori-
ties could diversify the social life on {
campus by allowing the women to

plan and sponsor social functions.

We recognize the reservations that _
people have about sororities coming
too soon or even at all. Weare nottry- ‘
ing to get sororities overnight, but we |
need to begin laying a strong founda-_
tion in order to enjoy the benefits of
belonging to a sorority before grad-

or rather they may fear being left out

if they do not participate from the

start. Surely in this case indecisionis . , ,
neither acquiescence nor apathy, but ¢
rather a definite position of slowing

the pace down a bit so that sororities
develop more on their own and with a:
majority’s initiative.

Indecision does not necessarily —
lead to the idea that there should «
never be sororities at W&L. It should ;
lead, on the other hand, to people
stepping back from the situation and:
looking at it objectively in regard to
need and responsibility, not as ‘the
in thing to do.”

No one should feel pressured into
deciding one way or the other before
they are ready. Perhaps this is one
situation in which sitting on the fence
for a year or two is the best thing for ;
both individuals and the W&L com-
munity as a whole.

In the meantime, everyone - re-
gardless of their opinion - should stay
informed of the developments, and
perhaps most importantly, speak out
with their views. Attend all meetings
of the sorority steering committee.
Only in this way can it be discovered
exactly how everyone feels about
sororities. And after all these ques-
tions have been examined, the sorori-
ty issue can be settled - all in due ‘ |‘

Letter to the Editor:

Is the concept of professional ethics dead at
Washington and Lee? Come on—‘‘SEE IT TO
BELIEVE’’—how much did Marshall Boswell
and his Sigma Chi buddies pay for last week’s
ad? That is just the type of managerial behavior
that has been keeping the really talented writers
of Reid Hall from working on the Phi for years.
Will it ever change?

I am also curious about why the Phi didn’t
spring for a full-page color photo of the brothers
of Sigma Nu. It’s about the only thing you, the
editors, have not done for your ‘‘up-and-coming”’
house. Was it rejected because the Phi can’t af-

ford color printing? You could increase the an-
nual fee paid by the other fraternities to cover
printing costs. I don’t see why you don’t take the
final step and change the name of the Phi to
‘‘What’S Nu”.

Any other ethical questions? Yes...When 17
fraternity presidents and their representatives
unanimously agree to ban even the presence of
hard alcohol at rush parties, to say nothing of
rush dates, are they committing an honor offense
(and I use the term loosely) when they disregard
that agreement? Sorry, I guess I’m just old
fashioned, but I make every effort to keep my
word. Dirty rush tactics should not be part of the
game-plan.,

I'm ashamed that journalistic integrity and
the merit of a verbal contract are no longer alive
at W&L. In the scramble for a pledge class
which, as of yet, has no idea what real “‘fraterni-
ty” is all about, W&L frat-men are covering
themselves with mud to look more attractive. I
don’t understand why using school media posi-
tions for the benefit of personal interest is so
blatantly pursued. Is this type of behavior in-
tended to be more attractive to the new W&L
gentleman? If it is, then we can no longer call
ourselves gentlemen.

Clydesdales parade here

 

By SEAN BUGG
Editor

 

The Budweiser Clydesdale horses
and beer wagon appeared in Lex-
ington today, beginning their parade
at Virginia Military Institute and en-
ding in front of Washington and Lee.
The appearance is part of a series
throughout the area to benefit the
Multiple Sclerosis Fund Drive.

The Clydesdales are staying at
Newmarket Stables in Stuart’s Draft.
Glenn Eickhoff, assistant driver for
the horse team, said that people were
welcome to come look at the horses.

Eickhoff is a member of one of
three travelling Clydesdale hitches;
his team is based in Merrimack, N.H.
David Pike is supervisor and lead
driver for the team.

There are two other travelling hit-
ches in the nation, one based in St.
Louis, Mo., and the other in
Romoland, Calif.

Eickhoff, who has been with the
team for five years, said ‘‘I’d worked
with horses all my life,’ so when a
position opened, he took the job.

“They really treat their horses and
people well,” said Eickhoff.

Eickhoff said that he had never had
any real problem with the
Clydesdales. “‘They’re very good-
natured and easy to work with,’’ he
said, adding that ‘‘they all know their
job.”

There are ten horses to each team.
The horses are rotated so that eight
horses pull the wagon on one stop,
while two of them rest. The horses
names are Pete, Craig, Pat, Sandy,
Scotty, Chief, Matt, Blue, Barney,
and Colonel.

Some of the horses’ positions on the
hitch are determined by their size.
Pete and Colonel, the two biggest of
the Clydesdale team, are hitched
closest to the wagon, due to the great
amount of strength it requires to pull
the large load.

The front members of the team
usually are Pat and Sandy, two of the
small horses. The front horses need
more agility than strength to make
the turns in a parade.

The horses normally retire from
their work around the age of fifteen,
depending on their health and other

factors, according to Eickhoff.

Also a member of the team is
Frank, a blue-eyed Dalmation who
recently came to the team, replacing
the former mascot. “He’s a young
dog,’ Eickhoff said. Frank, who is
one year old, will work for six to eight
years with the team.

The antique Budweiser wagon that
the Clydesdales pull around the East
Coast was build by Studebaker

before they began making
automobiles. This original wagon has
been completely restored.

Commenting on the care of the
wagon, Eickhoff said, “It’s touched
up everytime we go home.’’ The
wagon needs a total paint job only
once every six to eight years.

The wagon has been free of major
troubles, such as broken wheels.
Eickhoff called the wagon “pretty
heavy duty.”

During appearances by the
Clydesdales, Ejickhoff said they
mostly “drive them around and let
people take pictures of them.”’

The horses “‘usually get a lot of
response,” Eickhoff said. ““We do a
lot of colleges.”’

 

Fraternities warned:

 

By PETER BOATNER
Staff Reporter

 

Police warned four fraternities for
noise violations Saturday night, said
Lexington Police Chief L. O. Sutton.

Also this weekend, five W&L
students were charged with violating
Virginia’s state alcohol laws; three
for drinking in public and two for
underage possession of alcohol.

Phi Kappa Psi, Pi Kappa Psi, Kap-
pa Sigma and Sigma Alpha Epsilon
each got written warnings from
police for not controlling noise after
12:00 midnight.

Junior Markham Healey and
seniors William Rice and Joseph
Phoenix received summonses for
drinking in public. Sophomores

Carolyn Hopper and Mark Robertson
were cited for underage possession of
beer.

Despite the noise problems, Sutton
said fraternities were under better
control this weekend than last.

“Tt usually takes the house
presidents a little bit of time at the
beginning of the year to get their peo-
ple under control,”’ said Sutton, who
added ‘‘we’ve been fortunate with
cooperation from fraternity pres-
idents so far.”’

Sutton said he talks to the fraterni-
ty representatives each week when
they come in for party noise permits.
“Tf there is a problem, I speak to
them individually and explain what it
1877

“If we go to a house and don’t get
any cooperation from the house of-

ive students charged

ficers, then they may jolly well not
get a noise permit for the next
week.”’

Rules governing noise permits are
not “hard and fast,”’ he said, but are
generally based on cooperation re-
ceived from houses in the past.

If the police find the house officers
are trying to cooperate in controlling
noise and guests, Sutton will take this
into consideration.

“Our enforcement is done in a way
to foster voluntary compliance,” ad-
ded the chief:

In other police news:

*Senior Richard Hobson reported
his car speakers stolen from his car
sometime between Friday and Satur-
day night. The car was parked in
front of the Pi Kappa Phi house at the
time.

 

 

When asked who like the horses the
most, he said, “I think everybody
does, especially the kids.”’

Eickhoff has never seen any trou-
ble between the horses and the
crowds. However, they ‘‘always have
someone to walk alongside of them.”
That helps ensure that no one tries to
excite the horses.

The travelling team spends 10 to 11
months per year on the road. ‘“‘We do
basically everything,” Eickhoff said
of his and his co-worker’s job. That
includes taking care of the horses,

Seven grooms are on the team to
prepare the horses for appearances.
Although groomed daily, the horses
are groomed for about five hours for
an appearance.

Although on the road for long
amounts of time, members of the
team “‘have vacations and that sort
of thing.” Eickhoff said.

Staff Reports

 

Opening enrollment at Washington and Lee Universi-
ty for the 1986-87 year is at the highest point ever in the
university’s 238-year history.

Enrollment stood at 1,804 students when classes
began earlier this month, according to Scott Dittman,
university registrar. Dittman said it was the first time
enrollment at W&L had exceeded 1,800 students.

According to figures released from the registrar’s of-
fice, the total undergraduate student body at the
University stood at 1,429, an 8.4 percent increase over
the student body size at the end of the last academic
year. Of those students, 1,176 are enrolled in the College
of Arts and Sciences; 253 are enrolled in the School of
Commerce, Economics and Politics.

In its second year of admitting women under-
graduates, W&L had a total of 228 undergraduate
women and 1,429 undergraduate men. Ninety-six per-
cent of the women who enrolled during the 1985-86
academic year returned this year.

The W&L Law School had a total of 364 students
according to the registrar. Of that number, 140 are
women and 244 are men.

Symposium on W&L planned

The 19th century art and architecture of Washington
and Lee University and the university’s commitment to
its restoration will be the topic of an all-day symposium
at the University.

“Art and Architecture at Washington and Lee in the
19th Century”’ is the title of the symposium on October 8
that will bring together some of the nation’s leading ex-
perts in art history, preservation and restoration. The
morning session of the symposium is scheduled to run
from 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.; the afternoon session will
begin at 2:05 p.m. and end at 4:15 p.m, The symposium
is open to the public.

The symposium is being held in conjunction with the
dedication of the Morris House, one of four antebellum
houses on the W&L campus build in 1842. The restora-
tion of the Morris House, which will serve as the univer-
sity’s guest house and conference center, was made
possible through a gift to Washington and Lee from
Joella and Stewart Morris of Houston, Texas.

The Morris House will be dedicated during
ceremonies between the morning and afternoon ses-
sions, The dedication will begin at 12:30 p.m.

John D. Wilson, president of the university, and his
wife, Anne, will host a reception and dinner in honor of
the dedication on October 7.

Career fair set for November

Forty-five companies have registered for
CHALLENGE ’87, a liberal arts career fair that will be
held on Wednesday, Nov. 12, 1986 at the Radisson Hotel
in Lynchburg. This event is sponsored by Hampden-
Sydney College, Hollins College, Longwood College,

_ Lynchburg College, Mary Baldwin College, Randolph-

 

W&L enrollment at highest point

Macon Woman’s College, Sweet Briar College and
Virginia Military Institute as well as Washington and
Lee University.

Seniors who wish to participate must register by Oct.
10 in the Office of Career Development and Placement.

Throughout the day, the employers will have tables of
information about their organizations set up in a central
area. Workshops will be offered and individual inter-
views may be arranged.

Library receives memorabilia

The Washington and Lee University Library’s collec-
tion of theatre memorabilia is growing.

George W. Ray, professor of English at W&L, recent-
ly gave 80 autographed letters by fifty-five famous ac-
tors and playwrights to the University Library’s
Special Collection. These letters expand an existing
theatre collection the library received many years ago.

The letters were purchased by Ray in London last
spring while he was on sabbatical. They had been part
of a collection of theatre memorabilia belonging to the
late Alec Clunes, a leading actor and director in British
theatre who managed the Arts Theatre in London. Ray
was able to obtain the letters from Mrs. Clunes, who
serves on the Board of the London Academy of Music
and Dramatic Art. Hence, the gift has been ap-
propriately named ‘‘The Clunes Theatre Autograph
Collection.”’

Included in the collection are letters from leading
British actors and actresses such as Charles Kemble,
Fanny Kemble, Charles Kean, William Charles
Macready, Ellen Terry, Sir Henry Irving and Johnston
Forbes-Robertson. The earliest letter, dated 1807, is
from John Philips Kemble, successor to David Garrick.
Included also are letters from playwrights H. J. Byron,
James Robinson Planche, Arthur Wing Pinero,
Matheson Lang and Tom Taylor, author of ‘Our
American Cousin,”

Ryan to co-edit oratory books

Halford R. Ryan, professor of public speaking at
Washington and Lee, has been named co-editor of a col-
lection of books on American oratory.

Ryan and Bernard Duffy of Clemson University will
co-edit a series titled ‘Great American Orators:
Critical Studies, Bibliographies, and Speeches.”’

The series will treat important contributions by
Americans to politics, law and preaching through 300
years of American oratory. Each volume will be ap-
proximately 60 percent essay, 20 percent biblio-
graphical materials and 20 percent significant speech
texts.

A member of the W&L faculty since 1970, Ryan is a
graduate of Wabash College. He received his master’s
and doctorate degrees from the University of Illinois.
He is a member of the Speech Communication Associa-
tion and is past president of the Virginia Forensic
Association.

The voice on the other end of the phone was not Pat-
ty’s, and I was not happy.

“Who is this?”’ I asked.

“It’s the operator,”’ was the reply. ‘““Were you two
talking?”

“Oh no, of course not,” I said. ‘‘Whenever I make
long-distance phone calls to Wilmington, Del., it’s to
communicate in sign-language with my deaf-mute girl-
friend.”’

Okay, so maybe I didn’t say that to the operator who
cut off my conversation a couple of weeks ago. She’s
just lucky I hadn’t hit the old milk bar earlier in the
evening, or I might’ve cussed her out.

Those of you who are returning to Lexington probably
have had similar experiences with the operators. For
you newcomers, welcome to the wrath of Central Tele-
phone Co., the business most responsible for maintain-
ing the Shenandoah Valley’s historic — or perhaps pre-
historic — authenticity.

As a dorm counselor, I realize the mental anguish
Centel can cause. That’s why I thought it would be im-
portant to provide a step-by-step explanation of how to
make an operator-resisted phone call in Lexington.

Metro Lex is the only city I know of where you can
dial 0 and not get an answer. At Centel Central, the
switchboard lights up, and all the operators yell, ‘‘Tele-
phone!”’ but none of them bothers to find out who’s call-
ing.

Don’t worry. They’re just testing you and usually will
answer if you call back a second ortthird time.

Perseverance is a must. You can’t use a calling card
or make a toll-free call on a Centel pay phone without

the operator’s (cough) help. The first step, once the
operator answers, is to talk to him or her. Pray they
speak English.

The operator either will ask you for your calling card
number or the number you wish to call. Make sure you
know which is which, and speak slowly and clearly
— Centel operators love to scold people. “I didn’t ask
for your calling card numer. I asked for the number you
wished to call,” they’ll say.

‘Whoa, sorry. Didn’t mean to lay such a heavy load
on you.”

Then the operator will dial the number for you, reduc-
ing the possibility of your injuring a digit while punch-
ing digits. To test your reflexes and recall, the operator
will wait until the phone is ringing before asking for the
number from which you’re speaking. So when your.
hometown honey, parental unit or probation officer
answers the phone, you'll still be snarling with the
operator.

But finally, you will be hooked up. You'll converse.
You'll be psyched. Then IT will happen.

The operators will listen in. They always do. I’m sure
of it. Right when you're at the really good part of the
conversation, wham, they’ll throw on the static.

Or else, boom, they’ll somehow put another conversa-
tion on the same line, like a telephone orgy. But most
likely, you’ll just get the big whammy and be cut off.

Then the operator will ask you a brilliant question,
such as, ‘‘Oh, were you two having a conversation?”

And you'll be able to look forward to making your call
all over again. The wrath of Centel is never-ending.

The Washington and Lee Film
Society has announced its ninth
season: Our first presentation of
the year will be ‘‘Confidentially
Yours” (‘“‘Vivement Dimanche’’;
France, 1984) directed by Fran-
cois Truffaut. Showings will be at
8:00 p.m. on Friday 3 October and
Saturday 4 October in Classroom
“A” in Lewis Hall (the Law
School). There is no charge for ad-
mission. The film is in French,
with English subtitles.

Other films scheduled are ‘‘The
Boat is Full’’ (German/
Switzerland, 1981) on October
24-25, ‘“Cal’’ (Ireland, 1984) on

 

November 14-15, and “Colonel
Redl’’ (Hungary/Germany, 1985)
on December 5-6.

“‘Confidentially Yours’’ is the
great Truffaut’s final film, com-
pleted shortly before his untimely
death. Based upon a thriller by
Charles Williams (The Long
Saturday Night), this offbeat
detective story, filmed in black-
and-white, is an homage to
American films of the genre. Fan-
ny Ardant is wonderful as a
secretary determined to clear her
boss (Jean-Louis Trintignant) of
the murder of his wife and her
lover. Reminiscent of ‘Shoot the
Piano Player’’, this is a purely
Truffaut blend of comedy,
suspense, and romance.

At about 7:15 p.m., before each
night’s showing of ‘‘Confidentially
Yours’’, we will present an infor-
mal reception in the Lewis Hall
lobby, outside the Moot Cour-
troom. We will provide cookies
and coffee, and we hope to use this
occasion to make new friends and
to meet those of you who have
been with us for a while. We look
forward to discussing our series
with you and to receiving your
suggestions.

The support of many friends has
enabled the Film Society to bring
to Lexington — without admission
charges — recent films of quality
which have been unavailable in
local theatres. The Law School
has kindly provided the facilities
and numerous individuals have
contributed generously. While the
student Executive Committee and
the University provide partial
support, we continue to depend
upon your generosity to continue
the series at its recent level.

While we welcome all dona-
tions, we particularly solicit your
contributions in one fo the follow-
ing categories: ‘‘Sponsor’’ ($25 a
year); ‘“‘Patron’’ ($50 a year); or
“Angel” (over $50 a year).
Students may become Sponsors
with a contributions of $10 or
more. The program notes

contributors in these categories.

The Washington & Lee Rowing
Club will meet Friday at 5 p.m. in
the P.E. classroom in Doremus
Gym. All interested persons are
welcome.

The Office of Career Develop-
ment and Placement is sponsor-
ing sessions titled Identifying

Artist speaks to W&L students

 

By EVELYN M. FAHY
Staff Reporter

 

Artist John Borden Evans
presented a gallery talk to the W&L
community last Friday in the duPont
Gallery. Evans’ talk and discussion,
attended by mostly art stulfents
focused on his style and the practical
aspects of an artist’s life.

Evans said the paintings on display
in duPont were recent ones that
marked a change from his earlier
abstract ties. While not actually sur-
realistic, the paintings are the result
of an “‘action-reaction’’ method in
which Evans writes phrases that
come to mind on primed canvasses.
Often, the shapes of the words lend
themselves to shapes which evolve
into a finished painting in a time
period of six months to two years.

Since he is “not satisfied with
anything but the best,” he often
paints over paintings a number of
times until he achieves what he con-
siders to be good. This process
results in the thick, textural look
characteristic of Evans’ work.

Evans’ paintings range from small
works on paper, such as “Dripping
Cones,” to the massive ‘‘Yuki Man,”
whose Japanese title means
“‘snowman.”’ Evans declines to give
specific meanings to his paintings,
which he says come from his “gut”
rather than his head. He wants his

| viewers to get their own unique ideas

of what each painting means.
Evans also talked about his
lifestyle. A ‘‘househusband”’ with two
children, Evans follows a schedule in
which he paints on Mondays,
Wednesdays, and Fridays and
babysits on Tuesdays and
Thursdays. As the title of one of his
works emphasizes, ‘‘painting is hard
work.’’ Therefore, Evans stressed,
an artist must get into the habit of
painting on a regular basis, whether
he or she is in the ‘‘mood’’ or not.
Evans is a 1979 graduate of David-
son College.

Soccer ends skid with 8-0
shutout of Univ. of South

 

By GARY McCULLOUGH
Staff Reporter

 

After coming off a three game
downswing, in which the team failed
to score a goal, the soccer Generals
kicked back into action last Saturday
by overwhelming the Sewanee Tigers
in their own 8-0 shutout.

After defeating Shenandoah 3-1 in
the first game of the season, the
Generals suffered three disappoint-
ing losses to East Carolina, N.C.
Wesleyan, and Mary Washington.
Head coach Rolf Piranian said that
he was still very optimistic after the
string of losses. He said that although
the team was playing pretty well as a
whole, some defensive problems, es-

When the Generals’ Kevin Weaver
scored on a one-yard dive play with
1:10 remaining in the fourth quarter
Saturday against Centre, pulling
W&L to within one, there was no
doubt in head coach Gary Fallon’s
mind about the subsequent conver-
sion attempt.

‘“‘We worked too darn hard all week
trying to prepare ourselves to win,
and, given that opportunity, there’s
no question in our minds that we’re
going to go for the win.’’ The
Generals flooded a corner of the end
zone with three receivers, hoping
quarterback Jon Thornton could find
an open man. But a Centre corner-
back reached up and swatted away
Thornton’s pass and, with it, all hope

pecially in the midfield area, kept
them in the hole.

However, these defensive pro-
blems are now a thing of the past. De-
nying the Tigers of any goals what-
soever, the Generals took advantage
of what Piranian called ‘‘an explo-
sion.” This is, of course, referring to
the eight goals scored by the General
offense.

Despite the impressive offense the
Generals displayed, they could not
have won without the solid defensive
effort which ruled out any chance of a
Sewanee goal. Piranian was very ex-
cited about the ‘good, solid team ef-
fort” which he saw on Saturday. The
impressive offensive-defensive coor-
dination was the key to the victory.

When asked about personal scor-

fall short

for a Generals’ victory. The loss left
W&L winless in its first two games
and very concerned about next
week’s game with undefeated Ran-
dolph-Macon.

Fallon noted the effectiveness of
the Colonels’ defense, which had shut
out the Generals for 58 minutes.
“They swarm to the ball quite well,”’
said Fallon, pointing out that the Cen-
tre defense changed fronts often and
used stunts and slants to confuse the
Generals offensively, particularly
during the first half.

Fallon also praised his own de-
fensive corps. “Overall, I was really
pleased with their hustle and at-
titude.’’ The Generals’ defense was
surprised by changes in the Colonels’
offensive scheme, said Fallon. Key
injuries forced Centre to go to a dou-
ble tight end formation, using
crossbacks and traps rather than the

his virtue?

Hero Worship?

eThis past summer two athletes, one a professional, the other
about to turn professional, died sudden deaths. Apparently, both had
been using some form of the drug cocaine shortly before they died.

eLast November, the goaltender of the Philadelphia Flyers, and
winner of the Vezina Trophy as the best goalie in the National Hockey
League, died in an alcohol related car crash.

°A little over a year ago, during baseball’s drug trials the names of
several baseball superstars were splashed over the headlines on every
sports page in the country. These men admitted to, or were accused of,

To these few examples of the major moral transgressions of our
athletes I’m sure you could think of many more, both major and
minor, you’d like to add. Athletes, after all, are not always counted

And therein lies the point, why should they be?
Who are we to decide that because a man (or a woman) is a flawless
| performer on the athletic field that he should be similarly flawless in

Why is it that we expect a person that can run a little faster, throw a
football a little farther or hit a baseball a little harder than the average
human being to be a role model for our youth?

That person, after all, is only doing what he (or she) does best. They

themselves? No, certainly not.

are making a living in the best way they know how: through athletics.

We wouldn’t expect those who can predict the stock market better,
or who can write more clearly, or can design an engine more efficently
to conduct themselves in a manner which is 66/100 of a percent more
pure than Ivory soap. That would be unreasonable.

Sure, athletes are in the public eye and therefore must lead public
lives. But again, who is really to blame for that—the athletes

These women (and men) are doing a job, and they are getting paid

 

for their work. We should expect them to do their jobs, no more, no
less. It is our decision to watch them work, not theirs. How, then, can
we hold the athletes responsible for a decision that we make? (When a
professional athlete says that he would play even if he weren’t getting
paid it must be taken with the proverbial grain of salt. Please see the
recent rash of strikes, holdouts, contract squabbles, and free agent
bidding wars for proof.)

And yet, if an athlete does something imperfect (human, if you will)
off the field, we act as if we’ve been betrayed.

This past April, Dwight Gooden got into an argument with a clerk at
the rental car desk in an airport. Nothing major. We’ve all been in
arguments of that type. Why, then, was this little disagreement in
every major newspaper in the country?

The man was 20 years old at the time and the only thing that made
him different from others of the same age group was his occupation.
You see, because Dwight Gooden can throw a baseball at 95-plus
miles-per-hour we expect superhuman perfection from him and then
become very indignant when he doesn’t or (can’t) deliver.

Then, despite all this unreasonable pressure we heap upon our
athletes, despite all the outrageous demands we make of our athletes,
despite all the scrutiny to which we subject these people, we are still
bold enough to become offended when an athlete receives special
treatment.

This is not to say that I think athletes should get preferential treat-
ment. I’m just pointing out that while we heap an extreme amount of
responsibility on athletes we refuse to give them the corresponding
amount of privilege. I believe that they should not have to shoulder the
responsibility and therefore would not deserve the privilege. —

On one hand we demand that these people be paragons of virtue for
our children to admire and imitate; on the other hand we despise these
men and women when they ask for a break because of the pressure we
put on them.

These are impossible demands to make of someone, and certainly
not ones that should be made of anyone. Not athletes, not politicians,

not newscasters, not anyone.

 

 

ing, Piranian said that the scoring
was pretty spread out. Once again he
stressed ‘‘team effort.’’ A score does
not occur without an assist, and an
assist does not occur without a
previous assist. By the time one adds
up all the assists, it is obvious that an
individual does not score without the
all-encompassing ‘‘team effort.”

The first string took Tuesday night
off while the remaining members of
the team took on Newport New Ap-
prentice, but the team will return to
face Greensboro College this Satur-
day.

Saturday’s win provided the
Generals with much needed momen-
tum and should give them a boost for
this weekend’s match-up.

option attack for which the Generals
had prepared themselves the pre-
ceding week, The change in align-
ments caused recognition problems
for W&L’s linebackers. ‘‘We had to
play a guessing game as to where
they were going to take their
strength,” said Fallon.

Weaver, whom Fallon called ‘‘our
work horse,”’ had another great
game, gaining 121 yards on 35 car-
ries, placing him second on W&L’s
career yardage list. In 29 games, the
senior running back has gained 1,927
yards on nearly 400 carries and has
scored 24 touchdowns. ‘‘We’ve got to
get the ball to him as often as we
can,” said Fallon.

”

Fallon also praised the play of
Thornton, who completed 9 passes on
17 attempts for 106 yards. ‘(His
passes) had to be thrown hard and
zeroed in between defenders, and we

thought he did a pretty good job in do-
ing so.” But an effective pass rush by
the Colonels led to incompletions and
occasional sacks. On one play,
Thornton was sacked for an 18 yard
loss, stalling a crucial second half
drive and giving the Colonels’ good
field position. Nevertheless, Fallon
called the senior quarterback a very
hard worker and said that the
coaches “look for better perfor-
mances (from him) each week.”’

This Saturday, the Generals return
home to face Randolph-Macon, a
team which the Generals defeated
last year, 31-19. “I’m sure they
remember that,’’ said Fallon, ‘‘and
they’re certainly going to come (to
Wilson Field) to avenge that loss.’’

first three games this year, including

Harriers split first meet

Prepare for Sat. race at Norfolk State

By ELIZABETH PARKINS
Staff Reporter

 

Over the weekend, the Washington
and Lee men’s cross country team
began their season with a win over
Washington College and a loss to
Mary Washington. Overall the team
scored 32 points in comparison to
Washington College’s 82 and Mary
Washington’s 24.

According to head coach Dick
Miller the team ran as expected but
was hampered by a lack of team
depth.

We are not very deep this year, in
terms of quality, (and) when some-
body has a bad day it hurts us in
terms of team performance,’’ said
Miller. ‘‘This is about what happened
to us on Saturday.”

Although Miller felt no one par-
ticularly stood out, several team
members did place well in the eight
kilometer race. Junior Scott Rippeon
placed second overall with a time of
28 minutes, 31 seconds, Ted Meyers

was fourth with a 29:11 and Richard
Moore was sixth with a 29:43.

Saturday, both the men’s and
women’s teams will travel to Norfolk
State. The men will compete against
Norfolk State and Roanoke College.
Last year, the Maroons were the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference cham-
pions. The men’s team will not be
preparing in any special way this
week mainly because the course they
will be running on is slightly different
than W&L’s home course.

“The course is probably much flat-
ter than ours and we don’t always
know anything about our opponents,”’
said Miller.

The women’s team did not compete
this past Saturday when Emory and
Henry cancelled. This week, how-
ever, the team continued to practice
for their upcoming meet against Nor-
folk State. This week the team com-
peted against themselves in time
trials.

“The women’s team performed
well and the team is much improved
over last year,”’ said Miller.

school which Fallon praised as ‘“‘a
tournament-type team.” The Yellow
Jackets definitely ‘pose a real
threat,” he said.

Offensively, Fallon called Macon
ball carrier Remon Smith ‘‘one of the
finest backs we'll face. If he gets into
the secondary, and has a little bit of
running room, he can score from any
place on the field.... Given the oppor-
tunity, he can totally dominate a ball
game.” Fallon also praised quarter-
back Don Farmer. We’ve seen him
on film and have a great deal of
respect for his ability.”

The Yellow Jackets have a “really
sound”’ defensive squad, said Fallon,
noting that their defense has return-
ed interceptions for touchdowns and
recorded a safety already this
season. ‘‘They have a knack for put-
ting pressure on other offenses, get-
ting the ball turned over, and putting

 

 

i

their offense in good scoring position.
We look for a really tough game for
our offensive because of this,” said
Fallon.

HASHMARKS—The Generals es-
caped from Centre without signifi-
cant injuries, according to Fallon....
Kickoff against Randolph-Macon will
be at 1:30. The Generals lead the
series, 18-14-2, including last year’s
31-19 win.... Macon QB Farmer has
been recently diagnosed as having
hepatitis and is listed as questionable
for Saturday’s game.... Because of
this touchdown against Centre,
Weaver is only two points shy of
Chris Cavalline’s school record for
career points, and only one touch-
down short of the school record for
career touchdowns, which Cavalline
also holds. Weaver has gained 100
yards or more in nine of his last ten
games....

Richmond edges Polo

Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee water
polo team placed second in the Vir-
ginia State Championships held at Cy
Twombly Pool last weekend.

The Generals crushed Mary
Washington, 22-3, Friday night and
blew by the University of Virginia
Saturday morning, 29-3.

The University of Richmond also
defeated Mary Washington and
U.Va., setting the stage for yet
another W&L - Richmond showdown.

The Spiders edged the Generals,
13-11, in what head coach Page
Remillard called ‘‘a one-goal game.”’

Remillard said the Generals’ game
came apart in the third quarter.

“We had three guys just not get the
job done,”’ he said. “‘That changed a
lot of things.”’

The fourth quarter featured
spirited play with the Generals
matching points with the Spiders.
With less than 1:30 left in the game
and two goals down, Remillard put
sophomore Moose Herring in the
goal.

The strategy behind this move was
that Herring would allow W&L to
move a defensive player to the offen-

sive end of the pool.

“It’s like pulling the goalie in
hockey,”’ Remillard said. ‘It was a
great game, we just didn’t win.’”’ He
credited sophomores David Dietz
and David Reavy with outstanding
performances over the weekend.

Remillard emphasized that W&L is
gaining ground on Richmond. Last
year, the Spiders beat the Generals
in the same tournament 13-4.

“We plan on beating them (Rich-
mond) this weekend” at the first
round of the Southern League Tour-
nament, Remillard said.

Though the team has been improv-
ing, Remillard continued, crowd sup-
port ‘is worth at least two goals.”

He said the gallery carpet has been
changed and is no longer ‘‘an eyesore
and a danger to people’s clothing.”’

The Generals are scoring over 80
percent of their man-advantage
goals this year, Remillard said, up
from 60 percent last year.

Junior Craig Garneau designed a
T-shirt for the water polo team that
says ‘‘Sleep Tight Richmond” as a
light-hearted warning to the Spiders.

The Generals travel to George
Washington University this weekend
to compete against five teams in the
first round of the Southern League
Tournament.

General Public set to play Homecoming

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Entertainment Editor

 

British pop group General Public
has been signed as this year’s main
attraction at the annual Homecom-
ing concert, according to Student Ac-
tivities Board Chairman Glynn Alex-
ander. The concert will be held at the
Student Activities Pavillion on Oc-
tober 17 and tickets will be $8.

The Buddy System, an up and com-
ing band from Boston, is the tentative
opening act, although Alexander said
that this was still ‘‘up in the air.”’

At this time, it has not been decided
whether or not beer will be sold at the
concert, Alexander said.

“We're meeting with the ABC
(Alcoholic Beverage Control Board)
this week,’ Alexander said. ‘I’m not
really sure how the Administration
will stand on this. They might just not
let us do it. Right now, we’re kind of
in limbo.”

ABC law maintains that anyone
born on or before July 2, 1966 can
drink beer. Anyone born after this
date cannot purchase beer until he or
she turns twenty-one. Alexander said
that approximately fifty percent of
the student body is legal, and this will
have a bearing on the ABC’s decision
to grant the SAB an alcohol license
for events at the pavillion.

“If we can’t sell beer, it will
definitely hurt our business,’”’ Alex-
ander said. ‘‘The people who don’t
like the band and who would normal-
ly go just to drink and have a good
time probably won't go this year.”’

General Public consists of two
former members of the popular ska
band, the (English) Beat. Both Dave
Wakeling and Ranking Roger handl-
ed most of the lead vocal work in the
Beat, while Wakeling was, by and
large, the band’s principal song-
writer (although the songs were
credited to the band as a whole).
General Public picks up where the
Beat left off, concentrating on the
bright, lush pop of the Beat’s
“Special Beat Service’ LP and shy-
ing away from the leftist politics of
the ‘‘Wha’appen?”’ and ‘“‘Just Can’t
Stop It”’ records.

General Public will feature songs
from their forthcoming record,
which, Alexander said, was recently
previewed in New York and received
enthusiastic response from critics.

Alexander said the SAB is looking
into signing up-and-coming comed-
ians for performances at the Student
Activities Pavillion.

In addition, they are also looking
into the possibility of attracting bet-
ter known performers such as Steven
Wright, Sam Henison and Billy
Crystal. Because of the larger price

these comics demand, Alexander
said these performances might be
held at the Virginia Military In-
stitute’s Cameron Hall. The tickets
sales would be split with VMI.

held five years ago for a perfor-
mance by the Atlanta Rhythm Sec-
mance by the Atlanta Rhythm Sec-
tion. Since then, nothing of this
nature has been attempted.

Alexander said he doesn’t forsee
any problems as of yet. ‘“‘Just so long
as people don’t get too rowdy,”’ he ad-
ded.

The SAB hopes to liven up Friday
afternoon Happy Hour at the Gen-
eral’s Headquarters by providing
live entertainment, Alexander said.
Ideally, there would be no cover
charge, although a ‘‘minimal’’ cover
may be required.

Moreover, Alexander plans to book
a jazz band for Parent’s Weekend in
hopes of offering students an oppor-
tunity to take their parents to the
GHQ.

Thus far, attendance at Wednesday
GHQ performances has been good,
despite the new drinking laws, Alex-
ander said. However, he maintained
that this was probably due to the
popularity of Heinsohn and Day and
the Little Saints.

As far as the rest of the year is con-
cerned, Alexander said, ‘“‘We’ll just
wait and see.”

Talking Heads: Great expectations?

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Entertainment Editor

 

Perhaps my expectations of Talk-
ing Heads have been blown complete-
ly out of proportion. Or perhaps the
Heads have spoiled me. With each
new record, they surprised, intrigued
and challanged us. In the space of
five or six years, they went from New
Wave Nerds to artsy African funk-
sters and ended up pushing that
fragile bubble we call American pop
music past limits no one even knew
existed. They pioneered the pop
video revolution, were largely
responsible for the current
black/white crossover status of to-
day’s Top 40, and made the best con-
cert film known to man. So, we right-
ly expect a great deal; the question is
whether we expect too much.

Their new record, ‘‘True Stories,”’
is admittedly a very polished, well-
crafted effort that, by any other ar-
tist, would be something to be proud
of. Why then does it sound like such a
disappointment?

Primarily because it is nothing for
a talent like Talking Heads to churn
out well-crafted ear candy. ‘‘True
Stories” is nothing more than a flex
of the muscle for this band — a testa-
ment to their keen commercial
sense, if nothing else. Much of this
music seems to pick up where last
year’s highly successful “Little
Creatures” LP left off, the main dif-
ference being that the quirky eccen-
tricity of ‘‘Creatures” has been filed
away in favor of a more straight-
forward approach.

The album’s first single, ‘Wild
Nild Life,” is the most glaring exam-
dle of this. The track is basically a
‘eworking of last year’s ‘And She

Was,”’ right down to lead singer
David Byrne’s charateristic yelps
and yodels. It is all hooks and nifty
little guitar figures. There is nothing
particularly interesting, however,
about the whole affair; nothing that
makes the listener stop and wonder,
‘Now why did they do that?”’ Which
was not the case in ‘‘And She Was.”

“People Like Us” is another foray
into country music, but unlike last
year’s ‘‘Creatures Of Love,”’ this new
track isn’t funny, goofy, or wise. In-
stead, it seems to be regrettably
straight-forward. It even opens with
the lines, ‘‘In 1950 when I was
born/Papa couldn’t afford to buy us
much.”’ Where’s Dolly Parton when
you need her?

Side one does have its moments,
though. “Love For Sale” is a jaunty
rocker with enough weird vocal in-
flections from Byrne to keep it in-
teresting. It also signals one of the
record’s primary themes in its open-
ing line: “‘I was born in a house with
the television on.” “Papa Legba”
sounds like an out take from the ‘‘Re-
main In Light” album, although the
African influences has been brighten-
ed considerably in order to maximize
sales potential.

Most of the tracks on “True
Stories’ explore the world of
dreams, the place of history, and
children’s view of the world (another
hold-over from “‘Little Creatures’’).
“Puzzlin’ Evidence” is a gospel-
influenced romp that examines,
among other things, the media, while
“Hey Now” is a_calypso-tinged
number that has Byrne playing the
part of a young, wide-eyed child.
These tracks entertain, but they cer-
tainly don’t challenge. Whatever im-
portant ideas Byrne seems to be try-
ing to get across are lost in the over-
entusiastic arrangements.

Apparently, the songs on ‘True
Stories” were written for a movie of
the same name, although the ver-
sions on the record are not the ver-
sions that will appear in the film.
Perhaps these songs will gain new
power when they are reinterpreted
by the actors in the film (and thus
freed from the confines of the Heads
new commercial sense). And, again,

perhaps I am expecting too much.
Whatever the case may be, “True
Stories” is the first Talking Heads
album that does not usher in a new
standard and it is also the first Heads
album that I did not find fascinating.
And is it not strange that “True
Stories” will probably be this band’s
biggest seller? Apparently, it is time
to go back to the underground.

Spinners return to W&L

 

By JOHN PENSEC
News Editor

 

Friday night’s Spinner’s concert
will be different from previous con-
cert’s in that there will be a beer
garden, according to Tem Myers,
concert co-ordinator for the Student
Activities Board.

“From every indication we have,
the ABC will be at this concert in
force,” he said, adding that this con-
cert is going to be a ‘‘test case’ for
future concerts. ‘‘Depending on how
we do this, we may or may not get a
beer license for the next concert.”

Myers added that this could affect
Fancy Dress in March.

The beer garden will be located to
the left of the pavilion’s entrance and
will extend to the sound board. Two

rows of tables will separate the
garden from the rest of the pavilion.
The empty area in between the tables
is to ensure that beer is not passed to
those outside of the garden. Security
officials will patrol this buffer zone.
Myers said that only students of
legal age to drink will be allowed in-

side thé garden; braceléts will be us-~"

ed to distinguish them from the other
concert-goers.

Other changes require concert-
goers to present two forms of iden-
tification before entering the
pavilion. Myers said that required
forms of identification are a college
id. and a driver’s license. The
driver’s license was chosen as the
second form of identification because
there is less of a chance of a driver’s
license being forged.

All guests must be accompanied by

a W&L student.

“T think the beer garden is a good
idea as long as they can enforce the
law. It will help boost attendance at
similar events,” said Mae Gibson, a
senior from Atlanta.

The Inter-Fraternity Council is
sponsoring free round: trip shuttle
service to the concert with departure
from four sites in Lexington. The
sites and times of departure are:
ZBT and KA, 9:00 p.m.; S.A.E., 9:30
p.m.; Delta Tau Delta, 10:00 p.m.;
and the street side of Graham-Lees
Dorm 10:30 p.m.

Indecision will open for the Spin-
ners at 9:15 with the Spinners ex-
pected to begin at 10:45. All tickets,
whether purchased in advance or at
the door, are $8. There was a mistake
on the posters which said that tickets
purchased at the door would cost $10.

ola change
hits campus

By TOM BRICKEL
Staff Reporter

 

In a region where the name ‘‘coke”’
is synonynous with soda, the recent
switch-over by the W&L food service
to Pepsi has been pure blasphemy in
the eyes of die-hard Coke fans. But
for numerous business reasons, the
parting with Coca Cola, Inc. was an
inevitable and necessary business
move, said Gerald Darrell, director
of the university’s food service.

Problems with Coca-cola first sur-
faced with the inoperability of food
service vending machines selling
Coke and other brands of soda. Com-
plaints were received about products
being out and change not being
returned to such an extent that
“these complaints soon far outpaced
complaints about the Dining Hall
food,”’ said Darrell.

“It became evident that the cause
of these machines breaking down
was not the result of prolonged
beatings by frustrated, thirsty
students, but rather of faulty equip-
ment in the machines themselves,”
he said.

Billing procedures presented pro-
blems for the food service as well.
Darrell explained that because a
local bottler handles all billing for
campus vending machines, and the
parent company handles billing for
all fountain sodas, two bills were sent
each month to food service. In the
spring of last year, bureaucratic
oversight from this complex billing
procedure resulted in over-charging
for several months straight.

“The complexity of the invoices, in
addition to Coca-Cola's inability to ef-
ficiently deal with problems due to
the size of the company, led us to
believe that ensuing problems would
continue along these lines, despite
Coca-Cola’s assurance that they
wouldn’t,’”’ Darrell commented.

“A friend of mine, who happens to
be food service director for Roanoke

College, brought it to my attention
that Pepsi was offering a more effec-
tive, and far easier way of hooking up
the syrup cannisters for the soda
fountains in the Dining Hall, the Co-
op, and the GHQ,” he said.

“Called ‘Bag-in-the-Box’, it is a
syrup container that is much easier
to hook up than the bulky and heavy
steel cannisters we were using. When
empty, these containers are easy to
move and dispose of, and are left
with absolutely no syrup in them. The
system is so much more effective,”
he said.

But perhaps the greatest motiva-
tion for the switch came when price
savings were considered. ‘Pepsi of-
fered a savings 38% beyond what
Coke could offer. When one considers
a 38% savings on the 7,000 gallons of
syrup we use each year, with an up-
front savings of a dollar at the
minimum on each gallon, we are con-
sidering a savings of over $7,000,”
Darrell pointed out.

As much of the furor over the
change-over to Pepsi has been with
regard to the replacement of Coke
vending machines with those from
Pepsi, Darrell points out that one ad-
vantage to the move will be far better
service by these machines. “Our
agreement with Pepsi means we will
service the machines ourselves. Con-
sequently, the frequency of sold-out
soda and lack of change will be
almost eliminated,’’ he said.

Darrell pointed out that in addition
to the increased number of brands of
soda offered, suggestions are con-
sidered for other brands. ‘Even
though there are Coke machines on
campus still — those in Parmly and
Doremus Gymnasium are not run by
food service — we are taking into
consideration the possibility of offer-
ing Classic Coke in the present ven-
ding machines.”

A petition hangs outside of the
Commerce school mailroom with
over 150 names signed, requesting
bringing ‘Coke back to campus.’

Journalism professor attacks press arrogance

 

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Assignment Editor

 

You'd think that after 45 years as a

professional reporter, Clark R.
Mollenhoff would be very quick to de-
fend his profession.

But in the most recent issue of Quill
magazine, Washington and Lee Uni-
versity’s booming-voiced journalism
professor lashes out as strongly at
the media as he’s wont to do against
corrupt politicians.

Their crime, he writes,
rogance.

“This is the position I’ve taken con-
sistently,’’ Mollenhoff said in an in-
terview. ‘‘The public image of the
press as ‘arrogant’ is the biggest pro-
blem the press has in retaining its
First Amendment rights,’’ he wrote
at the start of his article.

“The problem is really with big
media as with big government,”’ Mol-
lenhoff said. Although he accused on-
ly a small minority of the nation’s
practicing journalists of being ar-
rogant, the 1958 Pulitzer Prize win-
ner did cite 10 common journalistic
sins dealing with disregard for the
rights, reputation and privacy of
others, as well as for the nation’s na-
tional security.

Journalists who do not have
legitimate reasons for printing
stories are ‘‘likely to strike viewers
as needlessly macho, callously ar-

is ar-

rogant and just plain destructive,”
Mollehnoff wrote. He said that a
University of lowa study showed that
70 percent of the nation’s libel cases
would not have been filed if there had
been any sympathy shown for the
subjects, such as through the simple
correction of errors. This is why polls
rate journalists no higher than used
car salesmen in terms of honesty and
ethical standards.

Mollenhoff said the guts of the arti-
cle came from a speech he delivered
at the University of Virginia, in
Charlottesville. Using the recently
publicized libel suits against Time
magazine and CBS as examples, he
argued that the media needed to
strive harder for accuracy and fair-
ness instead of who got the facts first.
“Truth is still a rather complete
defense” in libel suits, he wrote. But
just as a woman cannot be ‘‘sort of”
pregnant, a journalist cannot be
“sort of” right.

A former Washington bureau chief
who went from covering an Iowa
county courthouse to the White
House, Mollenhoff argued in the arti-
cle for a return of the double- and
triple-checking that he said were
standard Operating Procedure
before the Watergate affair. In the in-
terview, he said niany media pro-
blems were the result of what he
termed the “Deep Throat syn-
drome.”

Mollenhoff’s arguments will be

Photographer shows

By JOHN PENSEC
NewsEditor

 

President Ronald Reagan once ad-
dressed a group of photographers by
stressing the importance their form
of journalism has on life. They are
able, he said, to capture the essence
of a subject whereas writers are
limited by words. He could have had
two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning
photographerWilliam Strode in mind
when he said this

Strode, co-owner of Harmony
House Publishers, has just published
‘‘Washington and Lee,’ a
photographic celebration of the beau-
ty the University affords all who are

exposed to it.

The book, priced at $33, has passed
the $60,000 mark in sales. There is a
special, limited edition signed by the
photographer, available for $100.

According to Frank Parsons, ex-
ecutive assistant to university Presi-
dent John D, Wilson, Harmony House
approached the University about put-
ting the book together. In the past
they have published similar volumes
about Sewanee, the University of the
South, and Kentucky’s governor’s
mansion.

The difference between those
books and the one about W&L is, ac-
cording to Helena Roller, manager of
the W&L Bookstore, the vibrancy and

familiar to anyone who has taken one
of his journalism classes. In the arti-
cle, he cited the seven rules for sound
investigative reporting that he codi-
fied as a beginning professor at W&L
10 years ago. Although the recent
disinformation scandal has been a
major topic in his classes this year,
the scandal broke after he wrote the
article and could not be included.
Mollenhoff called ‘‘disinformation”’ a
bad choice of words and said the
scam was ‘‘an indictment of those
members of the press who get used.”’

The article, titled ‘‘An epidemic of
arrogance,’’ is the cover story in the
November Quill, the monthly publi-
cation of the Society of Professional
Journalists/Sigma Delta Chi. The ad-
viser to W&L’s chapter of SPJ/SDX,
Mollenhoff said he received only
positive comments about the article
at the SPJ/SDX national conference
in November. He has received lauda-
tory letters from Charlie Thompson
of ABC’s ‘20/20’ program and
Virginius Dabney, former editor of
the Richmond Times-Dispatch.

 

 

Executive
call to
Mollenhoff

By SEAN BUGG
Editor

 

 

On the last Friday before
Thanksgiving break officially began,
a special phone call came for jour-
nalism professor Clark R. Mollen-
hoff. As he was in class, however, the
secretary of the journalism and com-
munications department, Florence
G. Cook, took a message.

So when Mollenhoff finished with
his class, he tried to return President
Ronald Reagan’s call.

When he called, the President was
busy with some business, so
Mollenhoff left a message.

A while later the President called
back and the two finally had the
chance to converse.

Mollenhoff said that Reagan’s call
was in response to a letter Mollenhoff
had sent to him. In the letter Mol-
lenhoff told Reagan that he was ‘‘sup-
portive... and understanding of his

‘vibrance’ of W&L in new book

life Strode captured in his photo
graphs of W&L and the surrounding
area. The pictures in the other books
have the same richness and depth as
the ones of W&L, but they are devoid
of signs of life, she said.

Strode photographed W&L over the
course of a year and captured most
aspects of the University. Fancy
Dress and commencement are pic-
tured, but fraternities, which play
such a large part in the University’s
social life, were noticeably absent
from the book. The one exception is
the Kappa Alpha house. KA was
founded on campus in 1865

But the book, which includes pic-
tures from the university's archives,

contains quotations about W&L
which add a dimension to the book

Meredith Nicholson wrote, for ex-
ample, in A Virginia Impression:
W&L, written in 1906, that the
“college to this day puts a mark on
its alumni which is as indelible as it is
indefinable.”’

In the preface to the introduction to
the book, it is said that ‘‘So much
good and true endures at Washington
and Lee that it permits the Universi-
ty to exist apart from time, even as
changes in clearly perceptible ways
from one student generation to
another. Virtually all the color
photographs in this book were made
within the past year, yet they span

decades in their evocative imagery.”’

But perhaps the most beautiful
quotation in the book is by Jonathan
Daniels. In 1942 he wrote, ‘‘I brought
you this way only because I wanted
you to see the South at its most
beautiful: the green sloping campus
to the red brick buildings with the tall
white porticoes of Washington and
Lee University. I wish it were the pic-
ture of the South. I wish, indeed, it
were the picture of America.”’

While the university may not be the
picture of America, this book gives a
new perspective, through pictures
and words, to Washington and Lee
University

OPINION
Dean surplus

Has anyone noticed the number of deans Washington and
Lee employs? Eleven deans at a university with a student
body population of 1,814 students is simply too many.

The lineup of deans includes a dean of the college, an
associate dean of the college, a dean of students, an associate
dean of students, an associate dean of students for minority
affairs, an associate dean of students for Greek Affairs, a
dean of freshmen, a dean of the school of commerce, eco-
nomics and politics, a dean of the law school, an associate
dean of the law school and an assistant dean of the law
school. When a replacement for former Dean Capetto is
hired, he or she will be called associate dean of students and
director of career services. C’mon! What’s next — an assoc-
iate dean of students for food services?

Dean of the College John Elrod said that while the image of
a dean one conjures up is that of an academic dean, tradi-

tionally there have been deans for student programs as well.
Elrod explained that the associate deans of students are

given those titles because they are closely related to the dean
of students. While many of those now called associate dean of
students are excellent in doing their duties and deserve
thanks and appreciation for jobs well done. However, the
quality of their work is not being questioned, their titles are.

Does a person deserve the title of dean simply because he
or she caters to specific groups of students? The answer is a
resounding NO!

As enrollment increases, the university should seek ways
of limiting students into a cohesive group. Having a dean for
specific areas of student life or for specific students does not
do this. The university, however, should be commended for
resisting with the advent of coeducation, the urge to create a
dean of women. There is, after all, no dean of men.

The title of dean is a special one and indicates what should
be a unique place in the structure of any university. It should
only be given to those who earn it through distinguished ser-
vice to the university.

In urging the university to examine it policy in giving out
titles, it is suggested that the university consider the title of
assistant to the dean of students for specific areas. It may not
cut the number of people employed by the university; it is not
meant to. It would, however, add prestige to the title of dean.

Coke v. Pepsi

POINT

Since returning from Thanksgiving break, students have
been bantering back and forth about the benefits of Coke
versus Pepsi. (Coke’s better!” “Pepsi is!” “Is not!” ‘Is
too!’’) The Co-op is reminiscent of John Belushi on the old
Saturday Night Live: ‘“‘No Coke. Pepsi. Cheeseburger,
cheeseburger, chips....’’

The base of all these arguments seems to be this: the stu-
dent body has finally found something worthy of their time
and attention. No worrying about nuclear annhiliation, the
starving people in Africa (and America) or even student con-
duct for this affluent, cosmopolitan student body. Nope, they
want their Coke.

Just imagine what could be accomplished on a major issue
if the students put in the amount of work they have on the
Coke-Pepsi controversy. Why not a petition to the Board of
Trustees for divestment from South Africa? for nuclear
disarmament? or even for the opposite of these two issues?
The energy can be directed toward something more con-
structive than what soft drink is offered on campus.

 

—WSB
COUNTERPOINT

The people of the United States, and of Washington and Lee
in particular, take their drinking seriously, and they should
be allowed to drink what they choose.

in explaining why he chose to switch from providing Coca-
Cola to providing Pepsi Gerald Darrell, director of the
university’s food services, cited the fact that ‘Pepsi offered a
savings 38% beyond what Coke could offer.’’ He went on to
explain that the savings works out to over $7,000. That
amount is $600 less than the comprehensive tuition fee as
listed in the 1986-87 university catalog. The university should
admit one more student and apply his or her tuition to the
cost of maintaining the coke machines. With the way each
freshman class is growing no one will notice one more stu-
dent.

The battle between Coca-Cola and Pepsi will continue as
long as the two exist. One would think, however, that with tui-
tion as high as it is, students would be provided with their soft
drink of choice or consulted on what is offered, something
that did not happen in this case.

There is a petition in the C-school to bring Coca-Cola back.
The efforts of those who have already signed it are to be com-
mended. If such action accomplishes nothing else, it proves
beyond a reasonable doubt that students at Washington and

Lee are not apathetic when an issue means something to
them.

As exams loom around the corner,
students, especially those in the
freshman class, should be aware of
the Honor System now more than
ever. Perhaps at no other time dur-
ing the year is it more apparent than
during exams. The freedom of stu-
dents to make their own exam
schedule and to take exams without a
proctor present is a previledge that
few universities provide.

The Honor System states that W&L
students will behave honorably, and
will specifically not lie, cheat, or

steal. The Class of 1990, taking exams
for the first time at W&L, have been
repeatedly told that the Honor
System is not something to be afraid
of. It is not something to fear, but
they should be aware of it.

From 2 p.m. December 13 through
5 p.m. December 19, exams are
“hot.” Students are not allowed to
discuss any aspect of the exams with
any other student. This practice
prevents students from learning
what is on an exam and gaining an
unfair advantage. Talking about a

“hot” test could be considered
cheating and may be investigated as
a possible honor violation.

If the student body at W&L
becomes complacent about the
Honor System, the system is in
danger of becoming extinct.
Although the exam period provides
an excellent example of how the
system works, the ideals of Robert E.
Lee should stay in student’s minds
throughout the year.

Alum praises Phi, chides ‘arm chair editors’

To the Editors:

As a somewhat distant graduate of Washington
and Lee, I usually note items that I see in the Phi
with some interest, but am not compelled to res-
pond. However, in the few issues of the paper
that I have seen this year, I have noted a very
disturbing trend which I feel deserves some com-
ment. This has to do with the large amount of
criticism which has been focused on the Ring-
tum Phi itself.

I have a hard time believing, as Mr. Root
asserts, that ‘‘Nobody”’ likes the Phi. I am sure
that students are still eager to thumb through
their copy on Thursday night at the dining hall,
or to read a copy somewhere on campus. To
make a general assertion that the whole student
body, or even a large part of it, does not like the
Phi seems to be irresponsible — if not completely
ridiculous.

My suggestion to these arm chair editors who
have been assaulting the paper this year would
be to keep a few basic things in mind: 1) The peo-
ple who put out the Phi are students like you, who
give a great deal of time and effort to produce a
product. 2) The paper seems willing to allow any
student to come forward and make a contribu-
tion — if they feel they can do a better job. 3)
They don’t make the news, they report it. If
someone or some institution does something to
embarass themself, the Phi should not lose sleep
over reporting it. And 4) Human beings are not
perfect.

I think the staff can be proud of the papers that
have come out this year, and I wish them the best
of luck. Their product is far superior to other col-
legiate newspapers that I have seen. I’m tired of
seeing this criticism. Do the editors really need a
freshman to tell them the “fraternities do not
represent Nazism, Fascism, or the Ku Klux

Klan’’?! C’mon! Put up or shut up, it’s as simple

as that. Either make a personal effort to change
and improve the paper, or be quiet about it.

Classes say Tucker is too hot
To the editors:

It’s 38 degrees outside but you could have fool-
ed us! We just came out of the hottest classroom
on campus, and would like to know when the de-
signers or architects who built Tucker Hall are
going to come back and fix that disaster. The
classroom that holds all the introductory psy-
chology classes has the poorest ventilation
system built by man - and there’s no way even
the most interested students can stay awake ina
class that’s 80 degrees on a winter day. Won't
someone please find a way to put a window in
that place before we all die of heat stroke?

Burke responds to Lexicon

To the Editors:

In your November 20th edition of the Ring-tum
Phi you asked the readers a very bold question
—‘What is wrong with the Ring-tum Phi?” I
would like to take this time to comment on one of
the major problems with the paper, the column
entitled “Lexicon.”

The opening paragraph in the latest colum:
stated that my first letter, which appeared in the
Phi on October 30,” proved the columnist’s point
better than the columnist ever could’. Mr.
Pockrass, if you truly believe this, at least it
makes one of you.

As far as my letter being a “‘personal attack”
Mr. Pockrass, if you can’t take the heat get out of
the kitchen. Surely a person who comes to the
conclusion that a student run campus at W&L is
not working could not expect to receive an ova-
tion from adoring fans. Mr. Pockrass, let me
assure you that writing on such contraversial
issues will generate some criticism, and if you
feel personally slighted with every letter, may I
suggest that you become the food or entertain-
ment editor to relieve some of the pressure.

Nevertheless Mr. Pockrass I must commer.
you on your answer to my question — “How
would you have handled the situation?” Indeed
once your fraternity house holds a party like the
one you described, it will serve as the model for
all of us, congratulations.

Mr. Pockrass, instead of trashing the student
run campus at W&L, making this university ju: t
like every other one, why not occasionally com
ment on what the system does right, as well as
suggesting how alterations within the estab-
lished framework might make this a better
place. Do not always be willing to throw away all
that we have accomplished simply because the
number of failures with the student run campus
continues to mount. That fact is inevitable It is
not the student run campus at W&L that needs to

change, but the hasty critique of Students who , |
;

see just the bad that needs to change.

If the columnist and the other writers
understand this, the ills of the Phi ae
decrease.

Coeds are not liberal

 

MY VIEW
By Paul J. Smith

When Washington and Lee chose to
admit women in the Summer of '84,
many professors and students hailed
the decision as the beginning of the
end of conservatism’s grip on the
campus. ‘‘Alas’’, one professor ex-
claimed to me, ‘‘Washington and Lee
will enjoy a rise in academic and
political liberalism’’. He reasoned,
as many people did, that women,
traditionally the more liberal, social-
ly conscious of the sexes, would
revolutionize this campus, culti-
vating a new academic environment,
manifested by creativity, open
mindedness, idealism, and of course
liberalism.

Having returned from a Junior
year abroad, I have concluded based
on my observations that the W&L
woman, contrary to many’s expecta-
tions, is just as conservative, if not
more conservative than her male
counterpart.

Characterized by a burning desire

 

, to succeed, she seems locked within
herself, her motivation for work fuel-

, €d not so much by a passion to learn
"as by her ambitions to compete
” alongside her male counterpart. She

, is insecure. Thus, she clings to con-

servatism, just as her male counter-
part; her role is not to innovate,
change, or pioneer so much as it is to
prove herself in a man’s world, to
compete, to triumph.

In her new role, the W&L woman
forfeits her natural idealism, her

’ tions-social,

liberalism, her naturally endowed
sense of altruism and selflessness.
Instead of waking this campus to the
realities around it and saving it from
the decay of complacency and con-
servatism, she only confirms it,
enhanccs it, solidifies it. But I cannot
blame the new W&L woman. She has,
after all, reacted naturally. She has
learned what the W&L man has
known all along — conservatism and
complacency let one achieve his or
her own personal goals without in-
terference from impending reality.
She has quite naturally succumbed to
its compelling grip, its enticing
rewards. Its only demand — ‘‘Don’t
rock the boat. Blindly support the
status quo, and I will reward you.”’

And how it rewards! achievement,
satisfied ego, status, security, and
after graduation, material wealth. It
teaches one to be cold, how to be in-
different: to overlook the poverty
beyond the gate, to ignore the om-
nipresence of injustice. Regardless
of the impending issues of today — in-
creasing liklihood of nuclear conflict,
terrorism, apartheid, an incompe-
tent leader of the Free World, a
planet Earth, ecologically ruined,
unable to support its human popula-
tion — he or she doesn’t flinch.

The typical W&L student thrives,
myopically, in a world of parties,
BMW's, country clubs, G&T,s, Fox-
field, Fancy Dress Balls, Duckheads.
Life is one big bow] of cherries. And
understandably within this environ-
ment, the greater issues of our day
never get debated. the bigger ques-
political, moral-never
get asked. The result is a student
body afraid to rock the boat, afraid to

question the system, afraid to get in-
volved.

The price of this reticence is high;
unreasonable annual increases in tui-
tion; hideous price-fixing schemes by
our own bookstore at which we are
obliged to buy textbooks; immoral
decisions by our Board of Trustees,
such as its resolve not to disinvest in
companies conducting business in

, South Africa (this one will be difficult

to reconcile morally). Even more
significant is the impact of this at-
titude on our society, on our nation —
political and societal apathy; disin-
interest in the national and interna-
tional situation; general aloofness
from reality.

Complacency and Conservatism
will not save today’s precarious,
crisis-ridden world, tetering on the
brink of disaster. Old ways and old
solutions simply will not work. Hope
lies in new, unprecedented, revolu-
tionary ideas — ideas promulgated
by selfless, altruistic leaders groom-
ed in an academic environment of
enlightenment.

In 1984, we looked unjustifiably to
women to bring about such an en-
vironment — to dispell complacency
and save Washington and Lee from
the dregs of conservatism.

But in 1986 we realized that this ex-
pectation was unreasonable, that if
there is going to be change, it must
come from within — not from one
part of the student body, but from all.
Reality is waiting, knocking patient-
ly at our door. Are we going to let it
in?

The Phi needs confidence

 

MY VIEW

" By John Prescott Rowe

 

Let me say first that I’m not a crank

' out to tear down the Ring-Tum Phi.

This campus would be lost without a
student newspaper. On the Novem-
qber 20th editorial page, however,
“there were some issues concerning
stylistic points that caused problems
for me, and they make the Phi look
vad wi y.
By the editorial entitled ““Misbehav-
”’ there is a sentence which ob-
le escaped thorough _ proof-
wile eading. “While it is a breech of

“‘segulations,” the sentence stated,

he

.

‘students sneaking cups of coffee
and candy bars into the library
seems more justifiable than throwing
«4 keg party.” The word “breech” is
“ defined by the Pocket Oxford Dic-
tionary as the ‘‘back part of a gun or
.Tifle or rifle barrel.” The homonym

n oes the editorial’s context required

, was “breach,” meaning an infrac-

tion of a rule.

On the surface, this error appears
as a spelling typo, but to me it is slop-
py! Come on, y’all, I know there’s a
dictionary in the Phi office for clari-
fying this kind of thing. But since the
checking went undone, the result is a
glaring error in what some perceive
as the most respected, refined por-
iion of the paper: the editorial page.
And you wonder why so many people
have criticized errors in the Phi this
year when the staff cannot even iron

the eg.out of its editorials?
But ithé, problem is deeper than
mere gram or spelling. I noticed

an absence of confidence and back-
bone on the editorial page in this
issue. In the sentence above from
‘‘Misbehavin’,’’ why did the
writer(s) need to waffle on the issue
of bringing refreshments into the
library? I thought the point of the
editorial was to denounce improper
behavior, not to reference a double-
standard about food in the library.

In the third paragraph of the
editorial, the writer(s) concluded
that these students could have par-
tied somewhere else besides the

library. Ho Hum. My, what a revela-
tion! Were the editors afraid of tak-
ing a firm position against the party-
ing academics, perhaps for fear of
reprisals? I thought that an editorial
was intended to take a position on an
issue and support that stance. Ap-
parently, the Phi thinks an editorial
ought to be a glorified recollection of
the facts coupled with some mild
finger-wagging.

As an informed member of the
university community, I would like to
see an editorial page have the conyic-
tion to make statements and have a
staff to support these statements. I
think the Phi has become overly con-
ciliatory to outside influence on mat-
ters that it alone should decide. Most
great newspapers have a strong
editorial vein, and that vein earns
them the respect that makes them an
established part of their community.

This article may be tedious, but it
really is written more out of concern
than out of criticism.,I hope some of
these suggestions take hold, and I
look forward to a strong Phi for the
rest of the year.

Oratorio premieres Tuesday

By TOM BRICKEL
Staff Reporter

 

Behold the days will come
When the ruler of eternity shining with
full joy will pardon man’s sins
He will grow luminous

So begins ‘“‘A Christmas Oratorio:
The Sibylline Oracles,”’ a 14-part pre-
Christmas oratorio being written by
W&L professor of music Robert
Stewart. The first chorus from the
work will have its world premiere on
December 9 in Lee Chapel by the
Glee Club and the University Chorus.

Entitled ‘Behold the Days Will
Come,”’ the chorus, originally scored
with full orchestra, has been reduced
to organ, synthesizer, 3 flutes, and a
6-piece percussion ensemble for the
Tuesday night performance.

The oratorio is based on the 14
books of the Sibylline Oracles, books
predicting the coming of Christ.

According to Stewart, Orlando di
Lasso, a famous Renaissance com-
poser of the 16th century, is probably
the only other composer to have used

the text of the oracies as the subject
for a musical work, having composed
from it his choral work ‘‘Prophetiae
Sibyllarum.”’

Stewart’s interest in the work was
stimulated by several subjects:
‘Lasso’s ‘musical interpretation
caught his initial attention, but the
direct style and subject matter of the
Sibylline Oracles also interested him
as well.

“The style of this text is highly un-
poetic, perhaps, but it captures the
style of the oracles as they were
originally written in Greek. In addi-
tion, it’s subject is a foretelling of
Christ, rather than a description of
Jesus’ birth or death, as many ora-
torios depict.”’

In this difference alone, the
Stewart piece is an interesting con-
trast to Handel’s Messiah, an
oratorio written about the birth,
death, and resurrection of Christ,
which will be performed after the
Stewart composition. But even more
interesting is the contrast of musical
style and tradition in next Tuesday
evening’s program. Handel, a baro-

que composer, writes in a style we
are generally familiar with, with th:
organ as the only accompaniment to
the chorus.

Stewart, on the other hand, is a 20th
century composer whose style most
people are unfamiliar with. It is a dif
ferent style of music for people to
understand — many come awa;
hating it for what they interpret is a
lack of form or tonality.

The emphasis of the piece ‘is on
vocal line — it is a chorus that
technically could stand alone,
without instrumental support. Many
singers in the Glee Club and Univer
sity Chorus have found the piece dif-
ficult to sing, due to the difficulty of
these musical lines, plus the fact that
the instrumental parts rarely help
the singers by doubling their vocal
parts.

“It really is pretty interesting,’
said Meg Gilkeson, a freshman
soprano in the University Chorus. ‘!
knew it was going to be different, but
once I got used to singing it, I tried to
understand what Mr. Stewart was
trying to do musically.”’

Cold shooting hurts Generals
as Tigers coast to victory

 

By MIKE SHADY
Assistant Sports Editor

 

In less than spectacular fashion,
the Washington and Lee basketball
team opened up its Old Dominion
Athletic Conference schedule with an
87-77 loss to the Hampden-Sydney
Tigers this past Tuesday night at the
Warner Center.

“‘We got our butts whipped,”’ said
head coach Verne Canfield. “I am
totally disappointed with our play,
and you can underline totally.”

The Generals came out strong in
the first half, picking apart the
Tiger’s man-to-man defense with
some backdoor cuts and solid team
play. Senior forward Jefferson Har-
ralson, who led all scorers with 22
points, and junior forward Gary
Schott made some key layups as the
Generals built an eight point advan-
tage with eleven minutes remaining ,
in the first half. It was at this point in
the contest that head coach Tony
Shaver of the Tigers decided to make
some changes.

Pulling back into a 2-3 zone
defense, the Tigers took away W&L’s
inside game and forced to Generals
to shoot from the outside. Needless to
say, the Generals were unable to con-
vert on their perimeter jump shots
and subsequently, W&L’s lead
evaporated.

At halftime, the Tigers held a four
point advantage, 43-39, and the
statistics showed an even greater

Assistant Sports Editor

edge. The Tigers shot 19 free throws,
making 16 of them, while the
Generals never did manage to get to
the free throw line. W&L had com-
mitted 15 personal fouls and had
three players, senior forward Rob
Spencer, junior center Harmon
Harden and Schott, on the bench in
foul trouble.

The poor outside shooting con-
tinued to plague the Generals in the
second half. Junior guard Steve Han-
cock, the General’s second leading
scorer last year, had a particulary
vold shooting night going 3 for 16
from the field. W&L shot just 40% for
the game, compared with 57% for
Hampden-Sydney.

Some spirited play from Spencer
and Harralson kept the Generals
within striking distance, but Spencer
collected his fifth personal with just
over ten minutes remaining in the
ball game and was lost for the rest of
the evening. W&L managed to tie the
ball game on several occasions and
were definitely in the game with
plenty of time showing on the clock.
Again, however, the Generals ran in-
to some problems.

“There was a total lack of maturi-
ty, poise and leadership,” said Can-
field. ‘Some seniors didn’t play very
good basketball.”

The lack of poise Canfield was
referring to came at the six minute
mark of the second half. Some
critical turnovers had allowed the
Tigers to take a comfortable nine

 

 

 

 

 

 

point lead. The Generals, however,
played like there was two minutes re-
maining instead of six and seemed to
panic. The offense became hurried
and the resulting turnovers and poor
shot selection provided the Tigers an
opportunity to pad their lead to thir-
teen points.

Sophomore guard Ralph Baker,
who led the Tigers with 18 points,
tossed in three important shots and
freshman guard Jim Molster scored
seven of his thirteen points from the
free throw line as Hampden-Sydney
cruised down the stretch to the ten
point victory.

“We didn’t play well at anything
tonight,’ said Canfield. ‘‘I’ll tell you,
we are not going to play that poorly
again.”

The General’s record now stands at
1-2, 0-1 in the ODAC, after an im-
pressive showing in the W&L Tip-Off
Tournament on Nov. 21-22. W&L
finished in second place, losing to
Ithaca in overtime, 84-82. The
Generals gained the berth in the
finals after blowing away Johns
Hopkins in the opener, 67-37.

The Generals led Ithaca through-
out most of the game until the
Bombers tied it up with 1:52 left in
regulation. Harralson erased a three-
point deficit in OT with a three-point
shot, but Kermit Moyer buried the
game winner from the baseline with
just five seconds left.

“Ithaca is one of the best teams in
the East and if it were not for some
untimely fouls down the stretch, we

 

 

THE LINE forms here

With four minutes remaining and the University of Las Vegas trail-

 

ing Western Kentucky by five points, Fred ‘‘In the’’ Banks took the
outlet pass and started dribbling swiftly upcourt. Crossing the
halfcourt line, Banks’ confidence could be seen all the way from the
nosebleed seats in the upper regions of the arena. You see, Banks was
approaching THE LINE and the word ‘‘pass’’ had suddenly lost its
way from his vocabulary. Cool as a cucumber. Freddie pulled up at
the top of the key and let it fly. Count it! Nothing but the bottom of the
net. And for THREE POINTS no less. ,

Oh, those crazy guys on the NCAA Rules Committee have really
thrown a curve into that wonderful game of college basketball. From
19’9” and beyond, the little guys have risen from the land of the assist
and 0.3 rebounds a game, and have become - an offensive weapon (I
shudder at the thought).

Okay, the shot is too short. The pros heave it from 23’9’’ and the
shooting percentage (28%) speaks for itself. But 20 feet? I can make
two out of five from that distance and the people who I’ve played with
compare me to a young Jim Brickowski. But the whole idea behind the
new rule was to provide the guards throughout the country a chance to
become more important than the seven-foot lug who can dunk on his
tippy-toes.

Case in point. My main man, Jesse “The Rev” Jackson of the
University of Alaska-Anchorage measures about 5’10’ according to
the program (yeah, right - try maybe 5’8”). Yet ‘The Rev” lit up the
scoreboard in front of the hometown folks in the season opener to the
tune of 37 points. That’s right, you guessed it. THIRTY-THREE of
those points came on three-point field goals (that’s a total of eleven for
you math majors). And the thing was, it was absolutely great. Prac-
tically every player over 6’5’’ can slam, but how many of those players
can bomb away from 21 feet with two players in their face and still hit
nothing but cords?

Without the three-pointer, UNLV and Western Kentucky is just
another ordinary basketball game. However, with THE LINE, I ac-
tually watched the whole game — and even enjoyed it (UNLV came
back from 19 points down to win by one point in double overtime when
Banks hit for three with six seconds left).

The most important facet of the sport of basketball is the art of
shooting. Now, those who shoot the ball the best will finally be reward-
ed for it. And who knows? Maybe it might even be exciting.

Reggie “The Filler” Miller of UCLA boasts that the shot is just ‘‘a
layup” for him. That'’s the kind of confidence only a mother or a true
basketball fan could love. Gentlemen, the guns are fully loaded. Fire
when ready.

NOTES: Are my ears deceiving me? Was that applause I heard the
other day for John McEnroe? Eat it up while you can Mac, because I
have a feeling these fans just want to see you become great again so
they can enjoy your defeats even more... Adios SMU. You were a great
football team (I don’t know whether or not to label them ‘“‘college”’ or
“‘pro’’). And to think this program once felt they were robbed of a na-
tional championship a few years back... While on the subject, some
football predictions to send you on your merry way. Fiesta Bowl -

Staff Reporter

 

The American Football Coaches
Association has named Washington
and Lee junior John Packett to the
1986 Kodak All-American team.

Packett is a 6-5, 275-pound offen-
sive tackle from Salem, Virginia. His
selection indicates that he is one of
the best offensive linemen in the Col-
lege Division, an AFCA classification
which includes all NCAA Division III
and NAIA Division II colleges and
universities.

W&L head football coach Gary
Fallon called Packett.‘‘an outstand-
ing football player, who really work-
ed hard to win this prestigious
award.”

The fact that Packett was able to
achieve all-America status as a

junior makes the award even more
impressive. ‘“‘He’s one of the bright
spots coming back next year,” said
Fallon. The Generals’ head coach
predicted that Packett ‘‘will have a
super year”’ as a senior. Packett will
be a tri-captain on next year’s team.

Last month, Packett was named to
the Old Dominion all-Conference
team, along with W&L receiver Ran-
dy Brown. This was Packett’s second
year on the all-Conference squad.

Packett is the third W&L football
player to reach all-America status
during Fallon’s nine years with the
university. According to Fallon, ‘If
(Packett) has a good senior year,
there’s a good possibility’ that he
will become the first player in the
history of Washington and Lee foot-
ball to repeat as an all-American
selection.

Joffrey Il Dancers

Ballet at Lex High

 

STAFF REPORTS

 

Just in time for Christmas, The
Rockbridge Concert Theatre Series
presents the Joffrey II Dancers of the
Joffrey Ballet in a three-act ballet en-
titled “Tales From Hans Christian
Andersen,’’ December 7, 3 p.m., at
Lexington High School.

The ballet, which brings to the
stage two of Andersen’s best loved
fairy tales, ‘“The Little Mermaid”
and ‘‘The Nightingale,”’ was created
and choreographed by Donald
Mahler and premiered in July of
1985.

One critic called it, ‘‘An expensive
piece of reproduction furniture-
vintage style, executed with beau-
tiful new material.’’ Others have
Called it “evocative,” and, “‘a finish-
éd, lyrical piece, danced with finesse
and vivid personality.”

-. The Joffrey II is comprised of four-
teen young dancers between the ages
of sixteen and twenty-two, handpick-
ed by Robert Joffrey ai.d director of
Joffrey II Richard Englund from

dancers for the Joffrey Ballet, pro-
vides performance opportunities for
emerging choreographers, compo-
sers, costume designers and lighting
designers, and allows communities
unable to support a large ballet com-
pany to view professional dance.

The two stories in ‘Tales from
Hans Christian Andersen’ are per-
formed to the music of Edward
Elgar, and united by a prologue and
epilogue that one writer said
“reminds one of ‘“‘Andersen’s vision
and great love of children.” This
magical ballet is a holiday treat for
the entire community.

Local dancers will have the oppor-
tunity to participate in a master class
with Joffrey II Dancers following
their performances this Sunday.

The master class in ballet techni-
que will be held from 6:00 to 7:30 p.m.
at the Southern Seminary dance
studio. The fee is $15 and registration
must be made by calling Lee
RiCharde at 463-9670.

Because of the substantial support
given to RCTS by Washington & Lee
University, W&L students are admit-
ted at no charge.

For those wanting a “‘taste of
culture” and an enjoyable evening,
come to Lee Chapel tonight, at 8:00
p.m. Professor Robert Stewart’s
Music 113 students will present a
recital of chamber music complete
with pieces performed by the horns,
winds, strings, and percussion.

“They are all very accomplished
players’ said Professor Stewart.
Each of the performers has previous
training and participates in the
music program to sustain his or her
talent. This is the first year that

Washington and Lee has had a con-,
cert such as this one featuring in-
strumental ensembles. This concert
is a result of extreme student interest
according to Stewart, ‘‘They want to
play, and they want to play in

mance showcases three pieces by the

Native son scores big

 

By GREG TURLEY
Music Critic

 

 

As New Jersey has Bruce Spring-
steen and Indiana has John Cougar
Mellencamp, Virginia may now have
a rocker to call her own. Bruce Horn-
sby, a native son from Williamsburg,
has been a session keyboardist in Los
Angeles for years, playing in such
great bands as Sheena Easton’s.
Now, he and his own band, the
Range, have their first album, ‘‘The
Way It Is,” and we may be hearing
more from these guys in the future.

Hornsby’s keyboard talents are
clearly evident throughout the record
(On both piano and synthesizer).
What is appealing about his music is
the way he mixes both instruments to
form tight and clear melodies. Huey
Lewis helped to produce three of the
songs, and he gives the album a little
more depth than it might have had if
Hornsby had done the whole thing
himself. ‘The Long Race’, “Down
The Road Tonight’, and ‘‘The River
Runs Low’”’ all share Hornsby’s con-
cern of being far away from someone
or someplace. These songs have
more of an edge to them than some of
the record’s other tracks.

Hornsby’s Virginia horitage mani-
fests itself in his biggest hit, “‘The
Way It Is.’ He sees the country as
still being inherently prejudiced.
Talking about the Civil Rights Act of
1964, he says, ‘“‘The law don’t change
another’s mind/ When all I see at the

hiring time/ Is the line on the color

bar.” He is walking a fine line that

But Hornsby is an able songwriter,
and it is evident while listening to the
record. His lyrics, which he co-wrote
with his brother John, display an
understanding of the emotions of be-

With this effort, Bruce Hornsby
and the Range show that they are
willing to concentrate on some of the
problems of Virginia and the South.
Everybody writes about New York
and L.A., but it takes a little more ef-
fort to concentrate on the more deep-
ly rooted social problems of the
South. Let’s hope that Hornsby can
use his talents to focus more directly
on this theme in the years to come.

IFC discusses Rush
and beer gardens

 

By SEAN BUGG
Editor

 

, The Interfraternity Council met
Tuesday and discussed a number of
issues facing the Washington and Lee
fraternity system.

, IFC president Chris Saxman
brought up the possibility of new
University guidelines at the pavilion
for concerts and other functions. Sax-
man asked for the group’s feelings on
having a ‘“‘beer garden’,’’ a section of
the pavilion roped off and accessible
only to those of legal drinking age.

, One IFC representative mentioned
that he had seen the “‘beer garden” in
use at mixers at some of the
surrounding women’s colleges, and
did not feel that it was the best thing
for W&L. Saxman pointed out that
the issue may come down to either a
beer garden or no beer at all.

' Saxman asked the group how they
felt Rush went this year. Saxman
said he felt that there were ‘‘too
many guys blatantly breaking rules
to get more pledges.”

Many of the fraternities represent-
ed felt that the Rush period this
year was too long. Associate Dean of
Students Larry C. Atkins urged the
fraternities to evaluate their Rush
system and find ‘‘what is right and
‘wrong.”’

Atkins said that some faculty ad-
visors are pushing for a deferred
Rush, and the fraternities need to

figure out their position on the matter
in an objective fashion.

Saxman asked the representatives
to give the Council their suggestions
for next year’s Rush.

Many fraternities have been ask-
ing where the money the IFC collects
from fines is going. Saxman told the
group that the money is being held
for use later in the year for some-
thing like a charity organization or a
Greek Week.

One fraternity suggested the IFC
hold an “air guitar’’ band contest in
GHQ, with proceeds going to a
chosen charity, as a way of improv-
ing the fraternity system’s reputa-
tion.

All fraternities are being required
to turn in a copy of their pledge
education programs to Saxman, in-
cluding information such as the func-
tion of big/little brother systems.

Dean Atkins asked the fraternities
to ‘‘abandon the ways of the past,”
concerning hazing. ‘Organized
drinking functions are included in
hazing,”’ Atkins said, ‘‘and in fact are
the worst thing you can do.”’

The Council also discussed the rule
that bars women from being in the
fraternity house of a fraternity that is
on social probation.

A large number of representatives
said the rules were unfeasible since
the fraternity houses double as
residences for some members, and
those who live there often have

Psychologist proposes
trial support group

By VALERIE PIERSON
Staff Reporter

 

University Psychologist James
Worth suggested the formation of a
support group for students accused of
honor violations at the meeting of the
Executive Committee Monday night.
This group would help those accused
of honor violations deal with the
stress of the honor proceedings,
which Worth termed ‘‘sufficiently
great to warrant supportive efforts.”

Worth explained to the committee

hat students had observed a need for
such a group and asked that he pre-

ent the proposal to the EC. Worth
ted a case in which he thought the
used student did not deal effec-
ely with stress during the pro-
ding and withdrew from the
versity.
axisting support groups are inade-
ate for the needs of the student ac-
ed, he said. Most advisors to an
cused student are not bound to con-
fidentiality regarding the discussions
of the student’s case.

The proposed support group would
consist mainly of peer counselors
who have been acquitted on charges

in previous cases, Worth said. These
students, specially trained by Worth,
would provide emotional support to
students being tried. All information
regarding the case, including admit-
ted guilt or innocence, would be con-
fidential within the student-counselor
group.

This proposal has met with resis-
tance from several members of the
EC. Vice President Brandt Surgner
expressed his concern that there
could be a breach of confidentiality
by the counselor. ‘It’s hard enough
now to keep everything confidential.
If you bring in others, then there will
just be more problems,”’ he said.

Surgner also questioned the quali-
fications of peer counselors to deal
with the emotional stress of another
student. The University already has
trained professionals who would be
better equipped to handle a student’s
stress, he said.

Senior representative Andrew
Caruthers said he agreed and that
the EC should not ‘“‘sponsor a group
which may potentially contradict the
Honor System by hearing confes-

girlfriends who visit at various times
during the week.

Dean Atkins said that the rule was
structured that way in order to take
away all social aspects of a fraternity
during the probation period.

The IFC will have a chance to
change the rule if they want at the
next meeting, when amendments to
the Council’s constitution will be con-
sidered. For an amendment to pass it
must receive a two-thirds vote and be
passed at two consecutive meetings.

Saxman told the representatives to
read over the constitution and think
out any problems they have with it.
Proposed amendments must be
brought up at the next meeting.

This Saturday there will be a
Fraternity Symposium at the Moot
Courtroom in the Law School from 9
a.m, to4p.m. Saxman told the frater-
nities to send five representatives, in-
cluding the president. Represen-
tatives from all the W&L frater-
nities’ national organizations will be
present.

In other IFC business:

The Pi Kappa Phi fraternity
received a week of social probation,
which has not been assigned pending
a possible appeal by the fraternity.

The Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity
are currently under investigation for

a possible Rush violation during the
past weekend.

A SEAT RRR NEM
By CHRIS MUNSEY

Staff Reporter

 

Every other Saturday night, the Sam Houston Ruritan
Club holds an auction in a long silver building a mile
down Route 645, just off Route 11. The parking lot is
crowded with pickup trucks, the hall filled with local
families sitting patiently in long rows of battered seats.

The auctioneer stands behind a white desk on a raised
platform at the front of the hall, almost like a preacher
exhorting his congregation as he breathlessly conducts a
rapid-fire bidding on goods displayed by several assis-
tants.

One of the men working with the auctioneer holds up a
hair dryer being sold, doffs his Cat diesel hat and runs the
dryer across his shiny bald head. Another cranks away at
a ragged yellow chainsaw, which coughs noisily but
refuses to start. The interest of the audience is kept by
alternating from boxes of junk to more expensive pieces
such as beds, refrigerators, chairs, dressers, washing
machines and wooden tables.

Sometimes a story goes with the sale, as the auctioneer
explains the appearance of a washer and dryer in good
condition upon the stage. ‘‘The preacher that lives up
over on that hill moved to Florida and couldn't get’em on
his truck.”” The washing machine is sold for $160, after a
fierce bidding war between two women on opposite sides
of the hall.

Bidding for the first time is an exhilarating experience
for the novice. A fadéd Persian rug is dragged to the
display area, ahd this reporter decides to join the fray.
The dizzying speed of the bidding is confusing, and a
woman across the hall gets the rug for $14. A rheumatic,
elderly assistant shuffles up and hands it to me by
mistake.

A short, squat woman swoops down and grabs the rug
as I fumble for my checkbook. ‘‘You’ve got my rug’’ she
says with a faintly menacing smile. I agree and hand it to
her quickly.

The Ruritans have held auctions around the Rock-
bridge area for the past 20 years, according to John Cash,
a 1948 Washington and Lee graduate who has worked at
the auctions for several years. ‘‘The money is used for
worthwhile charities, things like kids’ tuition and camp.”

The auction season lasts from May to the early weeks
of November, and different lots of goods are fenced off
for each auction on both sides of the hall. The Ruritans
take a 25 percent commission if they hauled away the
merchandise, and 15 percent if someone else brought it to
the hall.

About three more auctions are planned for this season.
During the winter, the seats that fill the hall will be stack-
ed upon the stage, and the main floor will be used as a
storage area. Anyone short on cash and hungry for a bar-
gain should attend at least one of the final auctions,
before winter arrives and the hall is silent, holding only
memories of the auctioneer’s cries.

 
OPINION
Supportive

‘ At last Monday’s EC meeting, Dr. Worth, the school
‘psychologist, asked for the EC’s reaction to the idea of a sup-
‘port group of students for students who are undergoing an
‘honor trial. Dr. Worth suggested that this group could be

‘made up of students who had either gone through an honor

_: trial themselves or had a friend who went through an honor
“trial, as well as other students who are interested in helping

‘others. These students would receive special training in

counseling and they would be under the close supervision of

“Dr. Worth.

Dr. Worth explained that the primary function of this group

“would be to provide emotional support, not to provide legal

“counsel. A student who is undergoing an honor trial is ob-

-” S viously under great stress from the moment he hears he is to
“.: be charged until the time of the final decision. Often, under
“such stress, it is hard to keep up with the day to day aspects

-of living, such as getting homework done, or doing laundry. A

--:- support group could offer someone to talk to at 3 a.m., when
~-- an accused person might have trouble keeping his wits about

| ces him, .
cc The EC raised several valid points about this support
“group. During a session in which the support group members
- are talking with the accused student, it is likely that certainly

the name of the accused and the details of the alleged offense
would be discussed. The EC has traditionally kept these
details secret as a defense for those students who are later
proven innocent and who remain in the W&L community. The

-"-more people who know these details, the more likely it is that

they could be told to someone of the general public.

Dr. Worth suggested that the support group members
could make it known from the start that they did not want to
discuss details of the trial. This seems to be the best way to
handle the issue of confidentiality. Dorm counselors, legal
advisors, and friends to whom the accused student may con-
fide details of his case or even confess his guilt or innocence
are under no obligation to keep those facts confidential.

Many of these people do, mainly because they have given

their word to the accused student, but it really is a judgement

: call on the part of that individual counselor, legal advisor, or

~ friend.

. The EC questioned the neutrality of these support group
students in regard to the advice they might give on obtaining

-.. Jegal representation or handling themselves in front of the

EC. Perhaps the member of the support group didn’t think

his legal representation did a very good job, or thinks he
: "might know how particular members of the EC are likely to

vote. —
There was also a question raised about the liability of the

"group. If an accused student later feels he made some bad

-_ decisions as the result of the advice he received from the sup-

We agree with Dr. Worth that a support group for students
undergoing an honor trial would be a valuable asset. There
seems to be a real need for such a group. Dr. Worth stated
several students he has been in contact with, who themselves

-~had been through an honor trial, have said they would have

ve ‘benefited from such a group. Several students expressed in-
¢:. terest in becoming a member of the support group.

Pp
ould allow: the Honor

‘his defense more clearly and coherently. The EC wants to

bs _-find out the truth, not have the student leave before the truth
"ean be determined because the stress is too much to handle.

Ideally the Honor System is not something to be afraid of,
and if an accused student is innocent, then he need not worry.
Yet realistically, being accused of an honor offense is very
tramautic whether you’re innocent or not (especially if you
are innocent). =

Yet the idea of a support group is also a good ideal. To have
a group that would offer support without playing judge or
without leaking privileged information would be great, but is
it a realistic expectation? Everyone on the W&L campus
knows how fast gossip travels, especially news as juicy as

honor violations. It seems that the EC is only right to try to
__ limit possible ways that this information could leak out.

The EC and Dr. Worth should work to reach a compromise.

The idea of a support group is a valuable one. Perhaps the

students in the support group could sign cards saying they
.. would not discuss what they hear while counseling an accus-
. ed student nor would they testify against that student with in-

formation learned from those counsultations. While signing
these cards is not legally binding, it is better than nothing. Or
the support group members could, as Dr. Worth suggested,
let the accused student know from the onset that the student
should not discuss the facts of the case. We hope that the EC
-...and Dr. Worth can come up with some satisfactory com-

“promise for the support group. To reject the proposal
“: altogether would be to throw the baby out with the bath

MY VIEW
By Chris Carter

As I reflect upon my four years
here at Washington and Lee, the
repercussions of the Board of
Trustee’s decision of the summer of
1984 are becoming increasingly
distressing. I am not referring to the
addition of women to the ranks of
W&L men: I have been an ardent
supporter of coeducation from the
beginning. I am thinking rather of
the far more important (in my opi-
nion) decision to increase the size of
our undergraduate student body
from 1350 to 1500.

I recall hearing several dishearten-
ed people say on the anniversary of
Bastille Day in 1984 that “W&L just
wouldn’t be their university any
more — it would never be the same!”
I think that they may have been right
— but.for the wrong reason. When I
first walked the Colonnade as a
freshman I was one of a class of 360.
Almost everybody had single rooms.

There was no need to register for a
carrel in the library. The biggest
class I had was forty-five, and the
department concerned offered to pay
the drop/add fee for leaving the
course in order to get the class down
to a more manageable size. Now that
there’s well over 400 in a class, one
must “register” for carrels and
make sure that they look “‘lived in,”’
and we’re going to have to start giv-
ing the freshmen courses in how to
cope with claustraphobia. ("You
mean that’s a closet? I thought it was
a mini-fridge!”’)

So what’s the problem — just build
a new dorm (we’re doing that but it’s
for upperclassmen and won’t ease
the Graham-Lees crowding a bit),
put more carrels in the library, and
hire more profs, right? Wrong!
There’s no place to put any of the
above. We are fresh out of dorm
space unless you want to live out past
Liberty Hall (and you thought the
walk from KA was already too

long!.), the library is such a pleasant’:

place to study because it is roomy
and uncluttered (been to VMI lately,
anyone?), and professors have to

have offices, of which we are in
precious short supply. Not to mention
that all of the above cost money and
tuition goes up enough every year
itis. .
With regard to professors and their
offices, consider the plight of the
Romance Language Department.
Due to increased number of fresh-
men and the new general education
requirements, there are four more
Romance Language professors here
than there were my freshman year.
In order for them to have a place in
which to bleed on our quizzes, room
403 was converted into offices. That’s
fine except that now (due to increas-
ed numbers of students) there are so
many classes in that department that
a French class is being taught in Du-
Pont and Spanish is being taught in
Newcomb — not that there is any-
thing wrong with such cross-fertili-
zation, but if we continue like this we
will quickly reach a saturation point.
Just since I’ve been here I've notic-

ed that increasing ‘numbers of ~

classes are being taught at the ex-
treme ends of the day; it’s eight in
the morning or four in the afternoon,

Larger undergrad body bothers studen

especially when that class still
twenty-five people in it. In such a1
mosphere, the ‘‘personal learning
perience” of which the Admiss
Office waxes so eloquently just is
taking place.

When the Board of Trustees
nounced that class size would
crease, I think most of us were th

same day. We have dealt rather
with coeducation, I think, so we 1

ls the War Between the States over?

 

MY VIEW
By Abb Jones

Personally, I’d like to know when
this whole North vs. South thing is go-
ing to end. I mean, the way some peo-
ple at this university act, you would
think the Civil War is scheduled to
resume later this century. Occasion-
al kidding about a Texan’s pronun-
ciation of the word ‘‘oil business’’ as
“all business” is understandable,
just as joking with a Bostonian about
visiting ‘‘Hah-vad University in Bah-
stan’ rather than visiting “‘Harvard
University in Boston” is sometimes
acceptable. It’s when people refer
negatively to the people of a certain
area because of firmly imprinted im-
pressions of WHAT-THEY-THINK-

THEY-KNOW that problems arise.
Stereotyping people according to
outdated geographical aspects is not
only bizarre but ridiculous. It
especially frustrates me when I hear
someone who has never even been
past the Mason-Dixon Line try to

geographical regions based on the
few perceptions they have gained
from a limited number of people they
have met either at W&L (which, by
the way, is not necessarily a total
composite picture of either the North
or the South) or elsewhere. You
would think that, this being an
academic institution filled with in-
telligent people and all, people would
realize just how senseless and untrue
these unfounded yet overly-repeated
myths are. Contrary to popular
-belief, people from the South are not
all bigoted, shallow idiots who talk

funny, and people from the North are
not all unfriendly, backstabbing
jerks who talk funny. (Yes, I’m
afraid it’s true. We ALL talk funny.)
Granted, there are people who fit into
these categories, but let’s not judge
the whole barrel by a few bad apples.

Just because there are distin-
guishing aspects of these two regions
does not mean they are wrong or bad.
Isn’t it better to learn about and
understand the unknown rather than
to ridicule it? When I first came to
Washington and Lee, one of the
things that fascinated me most was
the extremely diverse demographics
of this school. People from practical-
ly every state in the union, not to
mention several countries, attend
W&L. Shouldn’t we at least make an
effort to learn about each other
rather than be satisfied with staying
within our closed, confined (and

LETTERS

limited) groups from our
regions?

In today’s times especially,
people moving throughout the U!
States due to jobs or other reaso
is becoming more evident that
ple’s preconceptions about ce
parts of the country are beco)
more realistic. Therefore it si
essential for us to realize that |
have changed. Besides, how d
know we won’t end up working
living in one of these regions thi
so often criticize because we fi
take the time to understand
other? All I’m saying is this: |
an effort not to stereotype peop.
‘North/South criteria. The w:
over, folks. Let’s put an end to tl
misconceptions of the North
South too. After all, we’re A
cans, not Northerners and Sou!
ers.

 

 

Reader upset by inconsistencies in SCC rules

To the editors:

I address this letter to Washington & ‘Lee
because so many different committees are in-
volved that I feel addressing the letter to
Washington and Lee as a whole is necessary. I
would like an explanation of not one, but several
inconsistencies on the part of three different
committees — teachers, deans and students
—which I feel constitute Washington and Lee as
a whole. z

First, maybe someone from the SCC could tell
me why a convicted cocaine dealer was given a
one term suspension and I, who was found guilty
of two minor conduct violations (mainly “‘goof-
ing off in the dorms’’) and also found guilty of
breaking social probation was suspended for two
terms. I was told last year that the SCC deals
with cases on an individual basis, and that com-
paring the cases was “irrelevant.” Well, irrele-
vant or not, I don’t think anyone in their right
mind can say that what I did deserves a stiffer
punishment than dealing cocaine.

Then after explaining that case, maybe some-
one could give me an explanation for the follow-
ing. After I had received social probation for two
minor conduct violations, another student
received the same (social probation) for a major
conduct violation. I know that there’s no set rule

that two minor violations equals a major viola-
tion, but seeing that we received the same “‘sen-
tence’, one could say that the two violations
were not far from being different. Well, ironical-
ly, myself and the other student broke our social

probations on the same night, by doing the same
thing: entering a fraternity. Well once again in-
consistency prevailed, and I received my two
term suspension while the other student was
given extended social probation.

I appealed the decision to the SAC, thinking the
committee consisting of deans, teachers and
students would see the unfairness. When I
brought up the other two incidents involving the
other two students, I was told once again that it
was “irrelevant.”

Then I received another “‘slap in the face”’
when I learned that the student who broke his
social probation, as did I, was allowed to remain
at W&L, and was suspended for having a 1.4GPA
at the end of his freshman year. But he
appealed the decision and was allowed to
RETURN to W&L!!! So I guess when looking at
the bottom line, W&L saw two students who com-
mitted the same conduct violations and one hada
1.4 GPA and the other (myself) had a 3.0 GPA,
they saw it fit to keep the one student and sus-
pend me.

And there’s more. Finally before leaving W&L,
I was forced, as any W&L student, to report an
honor violation. It involved a senior who held a
high reputation for character and honor at W&L.
But he committed a honor violation. There was
no question about it. I witnessed it as did another
person. Both of us were questioned by the EC as
were other students. Again inconsistency pre-
vailed as the student was allowed to graduate. I
guess the EC figured since he was a senior close
to graduation and that he was well respected by

many, that it was o.k. for him to break |
“honor code.”’

I came to W&L for several reasons. Two i
portant ones were justice and honor. I’m not s:
ing that justice and honor don’t exist at Wé
they just don’t exist all the time. I regret hav:
to bring up the other cases involving the ot!
students but it was the only way to reveal the
justice and unfairness. I am expecting
response from any of the aforementioned cc
mittees or anyone involved in these incident:
usually get responses like, “‘if it’s honor, talk
the dean.” That's funny, I was under the impr
sion that justice and honor was everybody's bi
ness at W&L and that everybody must try
uphold these values.

This past summer, newspaper columnist George Will
contended that “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off” was the greatest
movie of all time, that it was “the one most true to the
general spirit of movies, the spirit of effortless escapism.”
On Saturday, | saw “Ferris Bueller” a second time and
wrote the following letter to Mr. Will.

Dear fellow Bruce Springsteen fan,

In June of this year, you wrote that ‘‘Ferris Bueller’s
Day Off’’ was the greatest movie of all time. Although
movie criticism is by nature subjective, I take offense
at the above assertion.

It’s not just that ‘Ferris Bueller” is neither the most
original nor the most funny movie I’ve ever seen. What
truly bothers me is your opinion that it lacks any
seriousness. I’ve seen “Ferris Bueller” twice and have
concluded that its serious undertones, as exemplified
by some of Matthew Broderick’s into-the-camera solilo-

ng ‘quies, destroy its “spirit of effortless escapism.” Put

|LEXICON

letter to George Will from Steven Pockrass

simply, ‘Ferris Bueller” is too serious a movie.

I doubt that Ferris is a symptom of the “self-
absorption of youth corrupted by the complacency of
the Reagan years,” but he is an ass. He uses people,
especially his buddy Cameron, who seems more his
chauffer than his friend. Arguments can range about
whether Ferris is a likeable ass, and if Cameron is bet-
ter off at the end of the movie than at the beginning. But
regardless of how good you think the movie is, you can-
not deny that when Ferris tries to help Cameron loosen
up and not let life pass him by, he does so at Cameron’s
expense. The red Ferrari. symbolizes the danger of al-
lowing materialism to overpower human relationships,
yet isn’t it a materialistic day off for Ferris, his
girlfriend and Cameron?

Such arguments might make you think I am a stick-
in-the-mud, but believe me, I’m not. You think Ferris
goes too far with foul language. I didn’t mind the lan-
guage but thought Ferris went too far with his uncaring
use and abuse of other individuals.

Culler to speak on criticism

Jonathan Culler, professor of English and com-
parative literature at Cornell University, will deliver
the fifth annual Shannon-Clark Lecture in English at
Washington and Lee University.

The lecture, entitled ‘‘Structuralism, Post-Structural-
ism, and Cultural Criticism: The Role of Contemporary
Literary Theory,” is scheduled for 8 p.m. in Northen
Auditorium in the University Library. The public is in-
vited. :

An authority on contemporary literary criticism,
Culler holds degrees from Harvard University and St.
John’s College, Oxford University. He is the author of a
number of books, including ‘Structural Poetics, The
Pursuit of Signs’ and ‘“‘On Deconstruction.’’ In addi-
tion, Culler is on the editorial board of New Literary
History, Diacritics, Publications of the Modern Lan-
guage Association and other prominent periodicals.

The Shannon-Clark Lectures in English were created
in 1982 to honor the memory of Edgar F. Shannon,
chairman of the Washington and Lee English Depart-
ment from 1914 to 1938, and Harriet Mabel Fishburn
Clark, a grandmother of the donor whose gift establish-
ed the lecture series.

VMI hosts conference

Among the panelists for Virginia Military Institute’s
upcoming Conference on space Oct. 16 and 17 is ABC
News Science Editor Jules Bergman.

Bergman, who holds the distinction of having covered
every manned spaceflight in the U.S. program, will be
on the Thursday night panel session called ‘‘Projects
Mercury, Gemini and Apollo Revisited.” He will be
joined by astronaut Donald K. ‘‘Deke’’ Slayton and Gen.
Sam Phillips, who was Apollo program manager. Their
panel is set for 8:15 p.m. in Jackson Memorial Hall, site
of all the panels.

The VMI conference, called ‘‘The Future of the Space
Program,” will include panel sessions at 4:30 p.m. on
Thursday as well, plus three more on Friday. All ses-
sions are open to the public without charge.

A 33-year veteran of ABC News, Bergman was the
first full time network science editor when ABC created
that post in 1961. After writing for Time magazine, and
a period of time with CBS, he began to concentrate on
science news when he joined ABC in 1952, He has won
numerous awards, including and Emmy, and has com-
pleted much of the.same training astronauts go
through.

 

“Star Wars,” the original ‘“‘Rocky’”’ and ‘Animal
House” are just a few of the many flicks more true to
the “general spirit of movies” than ‘Ferris Bueller.”
They may have had some foul language or debauchery,
but none had the serious undercurrents that dragged
down “Ferris Bueller.”

According to noted educator, author and speaker Leo
Buscaglia, MGM has taught that love is a man chasing
a women for six reels and finally catching her. Busca-
glia’s excellent point may be applied to much of life. Is
popularity and coolness the art of using people, of hav-
ing complete disregard for the property and lives of
others?

Even you seem to think that ‘Ferris Bueller” is not
really a cut above, when you write, ‘Oh, carry me back
tothe olden days, when almost all movies were like Fer-
ris Bueller — no nonsense about seriousness.”’

I don’t know about the olden days, but I do know that I
would rather fantasize about being a Luke Skywalker or
a Rocky Balboa thana Ferris Bueller any day. Give this

discerning moviegoer a good guy who steals the
enemy’s fire, not his friend’s father’s car.

Granted, ‘‘Ferris Bueller’ was a funny movie, but not
an overly memorable one. Perhaps you chose to over-
look its serious aspects, but they do exist. Please see it
again and see what you think. I’m using this letter as
one of my weekly columns for the student newspaper at
Washington and Lee University, and if you wish to res-
pond, I’d be honored to take a week off and allow you
equal space.

Art exhibit displayed at library

 

By VALERIE PIERSON
Staff Reporter

 

An art exhibit titled ‘(Cheek and
the Arts” will be on display in the
lower lobby of the Washington and
_ University Library through Nov.

"the prestigious collection traces
the career of Leslie Cheek Jr., who
planned. and constructed W&L’s
Skylark Farm retreat.

Consisting primarily of water-
colors, pencil sketches, architectural
plans and stage designs, the exhibit
contains not only works from Cheek’s
undergraduate years at Harvard
University in Cambridge, Mass., but
also those from his 20-year director-
ship of the Virginia Museum of Fine
Arts in Richmond. The chronological
display of his works shows the
maturation of his dramatic style of
museum installation.

Born in Nashville, Tenn., Cheek
demonstrated artistic talent at an
early age. He traveled widely and
developed a keen visual sense that
would prove valuable in later years.
Hoping to become an engineer,’
Cheek enrolled at Harvard in 1927,
but he soon was drawn to the fine
arts. After graduating from Har-
vard, he earned a degree from the
Yale University School of Architec-

Point cards now valid in W&L Co-op

By STACY MORRISON
Staff Reporter

 

Now, even the cheeseburger, fries
and Coke that you buy in the Co-op
can be charged home to Mom and
Dad. :

Users of the point card system now
can use their cards in the Co-op as
well as in Evans Dining Hall and the
General Headquarters, according to
Director of Food Services Gerald J.
Darrell. The point card, which can be
purchased or charged home at the
food service office in the University
Center,: contains 100 points that
cashiers mark off for the value of
food purchased.

Darrell said that he decided to of-
fer the point system in the Co-op due
to numerous suggestions from the
students,

Sophomore Mike Washington said
he thinks the point card is useful
because: ‘it is more convenient than
cash. ;

Darrell decided six years ago that
the school needed a meal plan for

    

ture, in New Haven, Conn.

He completed his education in 1935
but found himself in a somewhat un-
fortunate situation: it was the midst
of the Depression, and he was unable
to find a job with an architectural
firm.

So he started teaching architec-
tural history at the College of
William and Mary. During this time,
he was responsible for the organiza-
tion of one of the first fine arts
departments in the South. After
World War II, Cheek began his ste-
wardship at the Virginia Museum of
Fine Arts, which became one of the
region’s foremost art museums.

Under his leadership, museum mem-
bership steadily increased on a state-
wide level, and the collection was ex-
panded to include works by Renoir,
Poussin, Calder and Picasso.

In addition to its 31 watercolors and
pencil sketches, the exhibit also in-
cludes a 12-minute slide show that
provides an insightful overview of
the multi-talented Cheek. His wife,
Mary Tyler Freeman Cheek, is the
daughter of Pulitzer prize-winning
biographer Douglas Southall Free-
man. She was scheduled to be a guest
of the university during the dedica-
tion of the Morris House on Tuesday.

system is ideal, he said, because
students pay only for what they eat.

Also for the first time this year,
point cards were made-available to
faculty members. Darrell said that
approximately 12 faculty members
have purchased the point cards.

Darrell started the point card
system in GHQ two years ago, due to
student demand. Point cards are
honored in GHQ for most items ex-
cept beer and cigarettes. _.

Darrell said there are many basic
advantages of the point card system.
If a student eats fewer than 12 meals
a week in the dining hall, it is ‘‘the
most economical plan” — it’s less ex-
pensive than paying cash for each
meal bought, and it can be used for
more than one person at each meal.

The point card is also valid for the
big theme meals the “ining hall of-
fers throughout the year, such as Oct-
oberfest, Thanksgiving Feast and
Christmas Smorgasbord. These
theme meals, as well as all daily
meals, are purchased at reduced
prices for users of the point card.
“For example: the Christmas Smor-

those who ate fewer than 12 meals a __gasbord costs $7.50 cash but is only 7

‘Soccer wins two;
: record above .500

 

By GARY McCULLOUGH
Staff Reporter

With two wins last week, 1-0 over
Roanoke yesterday and 3-1 over
Greensboro on Saturday, the
Washington and Lee men’s soccer
team vaulted over the .500 mark to
put their record at 4-3.

Yesterday afternoon, the soccer
Generals went down to Roanoke Col-
lege and won a close 1-0 contest.

The defense for both teams was ob-
viously very impressive, and no one
scored until junior John Coll found
the back of the net with the winning
goal, late in the second half.

“It was a pretty evenly played
match,” said head coach Rolf Pira-
nian.

The Generals continued their win-
ning ways this past Saturday by
defeating Greensboro College by the
score of 3-1.

“Defensively, we had some pro-
blems,”’ said Piranian. Piranian was
slightly disappointed that the team’s
defense wasn’t as sharp as it was in

X-country splits again but looks ‘encouraging’

 

By MIKE SHADY
Assistant Sports Editor

 

It was an encouraging weekend
trip to Norfolk for the Washington
and Lee men’s cross-country team.
Coming away with a split, the
Generals (31 points) posted a 36 point
blow-out of host Norfolk State (67
points) and narrowly missed upset-
ting Roanoke (29 points), who are
the defending Old Dominion Athletic
Conference champions.

The women’s team was not as for-
tunate and ended up losing to Norfolk
State, 18-37.

Junior Ash Andrews was the first
General across the line, finishing in
third place with a time of 27 minutes

Water polo still hasn

The water polo team seems to have
developed a pattern of play in tour-
naments this fall; blow out two or
three teams and then drop a close
game to finish second.

At the first round of the Southern
League Tournament this weekend,
the Generale ‘idn’t come in second
place — but: .sn’t exactly a tour-
nament,

The tournament is played in three
rounds with the third of the three be-
ing the championship round. The
results of the first two rounds are us-

test of character as I saw it,” said
Piranian. ‘The flow of the game
went against us when they tied it up,
pi we kept pressing toward the

.The score wasn’t indicative of
these problems as Greensboro was
only allowed one goal. The main dif-
ficulties were between the backfield
and the midfield, but the defense,
especially junior goalie Chris Gareis,
responded well when it had to.

“We seem to have established our
defense pretty well,” said Gareis. He
also commented that the team
members are starting to get more of
a feel of where everyone is on the
field and a steadily improving team
coordination is a result of this.

While W&L was struggling defen-
sively, goals by senior Peter Von Son
and freshmen Scott Levitt and Rick

Silva provided the scoring punch.

Gareis, as well as Piranian, was
very optimistic when discussing the
General’s chance at a successful
season.

and 37 seconds over the 5.2 mile
course. Following close behind were
senior Scott Rippeon (fourth-place,
27:52) and senior captain Ed Myers
(fifth-place, 28:02). Junior Richard
Moore and senior Doug Turrel, ninth
and tenth-place respectively, closed
out the scoring for W&L.

What made the meet so encourag-
ing was the impressive showing the
Generals turned in against the
Maroons, who return all their run-
ners from last year’s championship
squad.

“The ODAC may be a lot tighter
this year,’ said head coach Dick
Miller. “We made [the race] close
and may have won it if we ran just a
little better.”

The Generals were helped out
largely by a gutsy race from Moore,

ed to determine the seedings for the
championship round.

On Friday and Saturday, the
Generals romped against Mary
Washington (winning 21-2), the
University of North Carolina—
Wilmington (14-5) and Lynchburg
(18-4). Only the host team, George
Washington University, managed to
keep its losing score close, 11-6.

And, for the second week, the
Spiders of the University of Rich-
mond proved to be the spoilers for an
otherwise perfect weekend.

Richmond, ranked 19th in the na-
tion, beat the Generals 10-7 in the last
game of the weekend.

“We came out flat in the first
quarter,”” sophomore Matt Brady
said. Richmond established a 7-1 lead

 
 

The Ring-tum Phi, October 9, 1986

By JIM LAKE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee football
team only trailed for one second in
last. Saturday’s Old Dominion
Athletic Conference contest against
Randolph-Macon. Unfortunately, it
was the final second of the game.

The Yellow Jackets scored with
one tick left on the clock capping a 58-
yard drive on a tipped 21-yard
touchdown pass which gave Ran-
dolph-Macon a hard fought 21-20 vic-
tory. It was the Generals’ third
defeat inas many games.

The Generals scored the only

points of the first half on a 17 yard

pass from senior quarterback Jon
Thornton to tight end Garfield
Prebor. Kicker Bill Crabill added the
extra point with 3:55 remaining in the
first half.

The Yellow Jackets tied the game
on a 41 yard interception return by
linebacker Todd Rogers. Thornton
“probably couldn’t see him coming,”
said head coach Gary Fallon, poin-
ting out that Rogers was moving out
from his middle linebacker position
as the ball was released. The conver-
sion attempt by Macon kicker Lance
Hering tied the score at seven with
four minutes left in the third quarter.

W&L started the scoring explosion
in the fourth quarter with a one yard
run by Thornton, capping a drive
which could be the first half of the
senior quarterback’s career high-
light film. Thornton completed key
throws to seniors Randy Brown and
Bobby Wilson in a drive which gave
the Generals a seven point lead with
11:12 remaining.

Starting Yellow Jacket quarter-
back Rick Kline left the game late in
the third quarter with six comple-

who was sick before the race even
started.

“Apparently,” said Rippeon, “‘he
[Moore] was ill, but he still ran a
great race. Ash Andrews also ran
very well.”

WA&L is “looking better as a team,”
said Rippeon, as the all-important
depth was much more evident at
Saturday’s meet. Only 1:45 se-
parated the General’s top five run-
ners. The displacers, junior Greg
Casker and freshman Joe Geitner
are now only a little more than 3
minutes off the pace.

“We ran well and I was very en-
couraged,”’ said Rippeon. “It was a
flat course and we are more used to
running hills. It should be very close
at the ODAC championship and I
think we have a chance to beat
Roanoke,” he said.

Senior Steve Pockrass, who was
running at the sixth or seventh spot,
has been sidelined with an ankle in-
jury and will hopefully be back in
about two weeks.

The W&L women’s team, in just its
second year of operation, was led by
the fourth-place finish of freshman
Catherine Baillo (23:37) and the
sixth-place effort of Patsy Sciutto
(24:11) over the 3.1 mile course.

Miller, also the women’s coach,
was pleased with what he saw. “I
was impressed with the women. They
are much improved over last year,”
he said.

This Saturday the men’s team will
run against Catholic University in
Washington, D.C., and the women
will participate in the State Cham-
pionships at Liberty University.

‘t solved the Spiders

in the first quarter.

“Richmond built up a 7-1 lead and
coasted home with the win,’’ head
coach Page Remillard said.

“On the whole we did not play that
well, but I was pleased with a few of
our players,’ he added. Remillard
said freshman Adam Morgan and
sophomore Tom Rawls had good
games against Richmond.

Co-captain Simon Perez said he
was unsure why the team has not
been able to beat the Spiders.

“‘We have good practices all week”’
before Richmond games, Perez said.
“We haven’t been able to put a good
game together.”’

The Generals will face Richmond
again Homecoming weekend at Cy

Twombly Pool in the second round of
the Southern League Tournament.

This weekend the Generals travel
to Brown University to participate in
the Northeast Varsity Invitational.
The Generals will face Army, Buck-
nell, Fordham and MIT.

Perez predicted victories over Ar-
my and MIT. W&L have never played
Fordham but Perez said game films
showed Fordham to be sloppy.

Bucknell may prove to be the
Generals’ toughest opponent. Perez
said Bucknell is the only team on the
East Coast that a Remillard team
has not tied or beaten.

“Bucknell is missing some key
players,’ Perez said. ‘‘We plan on
going 4-0 this weekend.”’

tions for only 38 yards, and sopho-
more Paul Dillard came in to put ona
show. In less than 25 minutes, Dillard
completed 7 of 12 passes for 145 yards
and two touchdowns and left the
crowd of 2700 wondering why Kline
had even been on the field.

The Generals responded with the
second half of Thornton’s highlight
film. Once again, Thornton “‘thread-
ed the needle,” according to Fallon,
leading the Generals to a first-and-
goal situation on the Randolph-
Macon one-yard line. On third down,
running back Kevin Weaver scored
to give W&L the lead and set a school
record for points scored in a career
with 158. With only thirty-two
seconds left in the game, no one
realized that the block of Crabill’s
conversion attempt would end up be-
ing the deciding factor, except
maybe Fallon, who told one of his
players that “‘It’s not over yet!”’

The box score of the game reported
that the winning touchdown came on
a 2l-yard pass from Hering to
Dillard, but even the Yellow Jackets
would have to admit that the play
didn’t even resemble the diagram in
Coach Blackburn’s playbook.

At least three players touched the
ball after it left Dillard’s hands, and
two of them were wearing blue
shirts. But Hering came down with
the ball, and the Yellow Jacket bench
poured onto the field. After order was
restored, Hering kicked the extra
point to complete the scoring.

After the touchdown play, the
Yellow Jackets had been assessed
two 15 yard unsportsmanlike conduct
penalties on the TD, so Hering had to
kick off from his own ten. Chris Cof-
fland was tackled at midfield, and
the Generals fell by one point for the
second week in a row.

an edge, Centre crushed Maryville,
36-14, while W&L lost to Centre by on-
ly a point, But Fallon is reluctant to
draw such comparisions, saying that
the Generals will try to play “with
the same intensity and the same en-
thusiasm and the same eagerness to
win that we had (last) Saturday.”

This will be Maryville’s home
opener, and Fallon expects the vic-

tory to go to “‘the team that wants it.
the most.” :

Fallon said the Scots feature a’’
passing offense with ‘‘super
receivers,” two talented quarter-
backs, and capable runners. Defen--
sively, Maryville’s main asset is
quickness, said Fallon, although the
Scots do have some size. ‘“The most:
frightening thing about it is that
they’re going to be hungry,...but I>
have to think that we’re going to be
just as hungry.”’ a

HASHMARKS—Fallon was glad to~
see Weaver as the
Generals’ all-time scoring leader,

kind of individual honors” for a vic-

It’s only a dream

«« the pie in the sky turned out to be miles too high...”

—Roger Waters

I was sitting around the other day (avoiding work as usual) just
listening to some tunes, when those words caught my attention. They
brought back to mind visions of my younger days on the playing field
and, suddenly, I realized that this simple phrase summed up my entire
athletic life.

Almost every athlete dreams of becoming a professional or olympic
star at some time or other during his youth. I remember
hours on end down in my basement, imagining that I had just thrown a
perfect game in the deciding game of the World Series, or had rushed
for three hundred yards as my team won the Super Bowl. When I was
ten years old, I wouldn’t believe that I would never make it profes-
sionally in one of the many sports I participated in. My goal was to ob-
tain the ultimate pinnacle in athletic competition — superstardom at
the professional level — and then live happily ever after.

I’m sure that many people have felt the same way that I did (come
on, admit it) and also have felt the same foolishness that I feel now
when recalling those past experiences. Hell, I still go up to the gym to-

day and pretend that I’m Larry Bird or Charles Barkley and play out
my fantasies.

Well, get to the point, Shades. What’s all this garbage you’ve been
feeding us really mean anyway?

Look at the quote. “The pie in the sky” is the athlete’s dream.
“Turned out to be miles too high’’ is the realization that the dream will
never come true.

As I got older, the competition got better. I no longer was the star.
Accepting this fact can be difficult, probably the toughest thing I have
ever had to face. Nothing hurts your pride more then someone telling
you that you’re not good enough, especially when that someone is
yourself.

Take a glance at today’s sports figures and it becomes obvious that
even the few who make it big are still posed the identical problem. Do
the names Steve Carlton, Phil Neikro, Pete Rose and Reggie Jackson
ring a bell? These guys refuse to believe that they can’t perform at the
same level at which they once did. The words ‘“‘hanging on”’ and “‘fool-
ing themselves’’ describe these washouts that should retire. But their
dilemma is the same as mine; it’s just not that simple to give up and
pack it in, Their dreams were attained, but they want them to last
forever.

Deep down in my heart I know that I will never become the great
baseball or basketball player that I strived to be, but I don’t think it’s
all that terrible when I ‘forget”’ and relive the dreams all over again.

Does this mean that all athletes should quit when they realize that
they don’t have chance to play professionally? I think not. ‘Being the
best one can be” has always been one of my favorite sayings, and it
really holds true for what an athlete can still accomplish.

So don’t be disappointed if your dreams won’t come true. Work hard,
hustle, and enjoy the sport to its fullest. And hey, being a ‘‘pretty
good” Division III player ain’t all that bad.

Art exhibit displayed at library

 

By VALERIE PIERSON
Staff Reporter

 

An art exhibit titled ‘‘Cheek and
the Arts’’ will be on display in the
lower lobby of the Washington and
Lee University Library through Nov.
‘.

The prestigious collection traces
the career of Leslie Cheek Jr., who
planned and constructed W&L’s
Skylark Farm retreat.

Consisting primarily of water-
colors, pencil sketches, architectural
plans and stage designs, the exhibit
contains not only works from Cheek’s
undergraduate years at Harvard
University in Cambridge, Mass., but
also those from his 20-year director-
ship of the Virginia Museum of Fine
Arts in Richmond. The chronological
display of his works shows the
maturation of his dramatic style of
museum installation.

Born in Nashville, Tenn., Cheek
demonstrated artistic talent at an
early age. He traveled widely and
developed a keen visual sense that
would prove valuable in later years.
Hoping to become an engineer,’
Cheek enrolled at Harvard in 1927,
but he soon was drawn to the fine
arts. After graduating from Har-
vard, he earned a degree from the
Yale University School of Architec-

Point cards now valid in W&L Co-op

Now, even the cheeseburger, fries
and Coke that you buy in the Co-op
can be charged home to Mom and
Dad. ;

Users of the point card system now
can use their cards in the Co-op as
well as in Evans Dining Hall and the
General Headquarters, according to
Director of Food Services Gerald J.
Darrell. The point card, which can be
purchased or charged home at the
food service office in the University
Center,: contains 100 points that
cashiers mark off for the value of
food purchased.

Darrell said that he decided to of-
fer the point system in the Co-op due
to numerous suggestions from the
students.

Sophomore Mike Washington said
he thinks the point card is useful
because: it is more convenient than
cash. :

Darrell decided six years ago that
the school needed a meal plan for
those who ate fewer than 12 meals a
week af the dining hall. He then
started the point card system, fash-
ioned after similar meal plans in use
at 7 universities. The point card

He completed his education in 1935
but found himself in a somewhat un-
fortunate situation: it was the midst
of the Depression, and he was unable
to find a job with an architectural
firm.

So he started teaching architec-
tural history at the College of
William and Mary. During this time,
he was responsible for the organiza-
tion of one of the first fine arts
departments in the South, After
World War II, Cheek began his ste-
wardship at the Virginia Museum of
Fine Arts, which became one of the
region’s foremost art museums.

Under his leadership, museum mem-
bership steadily increased on a state-
wide level, and the collection was ex-
panded to include works by Renoir,
Poussin, Calder and Picasso.

In addition to its 31 watercolors and
pencil sketches, the exhibit also in-
cludes a 12-minute slide show that
provides an insightful overview of
the multi-talented Cheek. His wife,
Mary Tyler Freeman Cheek, is the

system is ideal, he said, because
students pay only for what they eat.

Also for the first time this year,
point cards were made available to
faculty members. Darrell said that
approximately 12 faculty members
have purchased the point cards.

Darrell started the point card
system in GHQ two years ago, due to
student demand. Point cards are
honored in GHQ for most items ex-
cept beer and cigarettes.

Darrell said there are many basic
advantages of the point card system.
If a student eats fewer than 12 meals
a week in the dining hall, it is ‘‘the
most economical plan’’ — it’s less ex-
pensive than paying cash for each
meal bought, and it can be used for
more than one person at each meal.

The point card is also valid for the
big theme meals the ‘ning hall of-
fers throughout the year, such as Oct-
oberfest, Thanksgiving Feast and
Christmas Smorgasbord. These
theme meals, as well as all daily
meals, are purchased at reduced
prices for users of the point card.
“For example: the Christmas Smor-
gasbord costs $7.50 cash but is only 7
points or $5.60,”’ according to an in-
formation bulletin from the Food Ser-
vices Department.

Another benefit of the point card is

Point cards can be purchased at

worth of points. So far this year, says
Darrell, 483 point cards have been

One disadvantage of the point
system is the great deal of manual

work it creates for cashiers and

other than the dining hall must be
carefully recorded for food service

Soccer wins two;
record above .500

By GARY McCULLOUGH
Staff Reporter

With two wins last week, 1-0 over
Roanoke yesterday and 3-1 over
Greensboro on Saturday, the
Washington and Lee men’s soccer
team vaulted over the .500 mark to
put their record at 4-3.

Yesterday afternoon, the soccer
Generals went down to Roanoke Col-
lege and won a close 1-0 contest.

The defense for both teams was ob-
viously very impressive, and no one
scored until junior John Coll found
the back of the net with the winning
goal, late in the second half.

“It was a pretty evenly played
match,” said head coach Rolf Pira-
nian.

The Generals continued their win-
ning ways this past Saturday by
defeating Greensboro College by the
score of 3-1.

“Defensively, we had some pro-
blems,”’ said Piranian. Piranian was
slightly disappointed that the team’s
defense wasn’t as sharp as it was in

X-country splits again but looks ‘encouraging’

 

By MIKE SHADY
Assistant Sports Editor

 

It was an encouraging weekend
trip to Norfolk for the Washington
and Lee men’s cross-country team.
Coming away with a split, the
Generals (31 points) posted a 36 point
blow-out of host Norfolk State (67
points) and narrowly missed upset-
ting Roanoke (29 points), who are
the defending Old Dominion Athletic
Conference champions.

The women’s team was not as for-
tunate and ended up losing to Norfolk
State, 18-37.

Junior Ash Andrews was the first
General across the line, finishing in
third place with a time of 27 minutes

the game against Sewanee. “It was a
test of character as I saw it,’ said
Piranian. ‘The flow of the game
went against us when they tied it up,
but we kept pressing toward the
end.”

The score wasn’t indicative of
these problems as Greensboro was
only allowed one goal. The main dif-
ficulties were between the backfield
and the midfield, but the defense,
especially junior goalie Chris Gareis,
responded well when it had to.

“We seem to have established our
defense pretty well,” said Gareis. He
also commented that the team
members are starting to get more of
a feel of where everyone is on the
field and a steadily improving team
coordination is a result of this.

While W&L was struggling defen-
sively, goals by senior Peter Von Son
and freshmen Scott Levitt and Rick
Silva provided the scoring punch.

Gareis, as well as Piranian, was
very optimistic when discussing the
General’s chance at a successful
season.

and 37 seconds over the 5.2 mile
course. Following close behind were
senior Scott Rippeon (fourth-place,
27:52) and senior captain Ed Myers
(fifth-place, 28:02). Junior Richard
Moore and senior Doug Turrel, ninth
and tenth-place respectively, closed
out the scoring for W&L.

What made the meet so encourag-
ing was the impressive showing the
Generals turned in against the
Maroons, who return all their run-
ners from last year’s championship
squad.

“The ODAC may be a lot tighter
this year,’ said head coach Dick
Miller. ‘‘We made [the race] close
and may have won it if we ran just a
little better.”’

The Generals were helped out
largely by a gutsy race from Moore,

 

The Ring-tum Phi, October 9, 1986

By JIM LAKE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee football
team only trailed for one second in
last Saturday’s Old Dominion
Athletic Conference contest against
Randolph-Macon. Unfortunately, it
was the final second of the game.

The Yellow Jackets scored with
one tick left on the clock capping a 58-
yard drive on a tipped 21-yard
touchdown pass which gave Ran-
dolph-Macon a hard fought 21-20 vic-
tory. It was the Generals’ third
defeat in as many games.

The Generals scored the only
points of the first half on a 17 yard
pass from senior quarterback Jon
Thornton to tight end Garfield
Prebor. Kicker Bill Crabill added the
extra point with 3:55 remaining in the
first half.

The Yellow Jackets tied the game
on a 4i yard interception return by
linebacker Todd Rogers. Thornton
“probably couldn’t see him coming,”
said head coach Gary Fallon, poin-
ting out that Rogers was moving out
from his middie linebacker position
as the ball was released. The conver-
sion attempt by Macon kicker Lance
Hering tied the score at seven with
four minutes left in the third quarter.

WA&L started the scoring explosion
in the fourth quarter with a one yard
run by Thornton, capping a drive
which could be the first half of the
senior quarterback’s career high-
light film. Thornton completed key
throws to seniors Randy Brown and
Bobby Wilson in a drive which gave
the Generals a seven point lead with
11:12 remaining.

Starting Yellow Jacket quarter-
back Rick Kline left the game late in

who was sick before the race even
started.

“Apparently,” said Rippeon, “he
[Moore] was ill, but he still ran a
great race. Ash Andrews also ran
very well.”

W&L is “looking better as a team,”
said Rippeon, as the all-important
depth was much more evident at
Saturday’s meet. Only 1:45 se-
parated the General’s top five run-
ners. The displacers, junior Greg
Casker and freshman Joe Geitner
are now only a little more than 3
minutes off the pace.

‘“‘We ran well and I was very en-
couraged,” said Rippeon. ‘‘It was a
flat course and we are more used to
running hills. It should be very close
at the ODAC championship and I
think we have a chance to beat
Roanoke,”’ he said.

Senior Steve Pockrass, who was
running at the sixth or seventh spot,
has been sidelined with an ankle in-
jury and will hopefully be back in
about two weeks.

The W&L women’s team, in just its
second year of operation, was led by
the fourth-place finish of freshman
Catherine Baillo (23:37) and the
sixth-place effort of Patsy Sciutto
(24:11) over the 3.1 mile course.

Miller, also the women’s coach,
was pleased with what he saw. ‘I
was impressed with the women. They
are much improved over last year,”’
he said.

This Saturday the men’s team will
run against Catholic University in
Washington, D.C., and the women
will participate in the State Cham-
pionships at Liberty University.

Water polo still hasn’t solved the Spiders

 

By MATHEW HORRIDGE
Staff Reporter

 

The water polo team seems to have
developed a pattern of play in tour-
naments this fall; blow out two or
three teams and then drop a close
game to finish second.

At the first round of the Southern
League Tournament this weekend,

the Generals ‘idn’t come in second
place — but: .sn’t exactly a tour-
nament.

The tournament is played in three
rounds with the third of the three be-
ing the championship round. The
results of the first two rounds are us-

ed to determine the seedings for the
championship round.

On Friday and Saturday, the
Generals romped against Mary
Washington (winning 21-2), the

University of North Carolina—
Wilmington (14-5) and Lynchburg
(18-4). Only the host team, George
Washington University, managed to
keep its losing score close, 11-6.

And, for the second week, the
Spiders of the University of Rich-
mond proved to be the spoilers for an
otherwise perfect weekend.

Richmond, ranked 19th in the na-
tion, beat the Generals 10-7 in the last
game of the weekend.

“We came out flat in the first
quarter,’ sophomore Matt Brady
said. Richmond established a 7-1 lead

in the first quarter.

“Richmond built up a 7-1 lead and
coasted home with the win,’ head
coach Page Remillard said.

“On the whole we did not play that
well, but I was pleased with a few of
our players,’ he added. Remillard
said freshman Adam Morgan and
sophomore Tom Rawls had good
games against Richmond.

Co-captain Simon Perez said he
was unsure why the team has not
been able to beat the Spiders.

“We have good practices all week”’
before Richmond games, Perez said.
“‘We haven’t been able to put a good
game together.”’

The Generals will face Richmond
again Homecoming weekend at Cy

Twombly Pool in the second round of
the Southern League Tournament.

This weekend the Generals travel
to Brown University to participate in
the Northeast Varsity Invitational.
The Generals will face Army, Buck-
nell, Fordham and MIT.

Perez predicted victories over Ar-
my and MIT. W&L have never played
Fordham but Perez said game films
showed Fordham to be sloppy.

Bucknell may prove to be the
Generals’ toughest opponent. Perez
said Bucknell is the only team on the
East Coast that a Remillard team
has not tied or beaten.

“Bucknell is missing some key
players,’’ Perez said. ‘“‘We plan on
going 4-0 this weekend.”’

tions for only 38 yards, and sopho-
more Paul Dillard came in to put ona
show. In less than 25 minutes, Dillard
completed 7 of 12 passes for 145 yards
and two touchdowns and left the
crowd of 2700 wondering why Kline
had even been on the field.

The Generals responded with the
second half of Thornton’s highlight
film. Once again, Thornton ‘‘thread-
ed the needle,” according to Fallon,
leading the Generals to a first-and-
goal situation on the Randolph-
Macon one-yard line. On third down,
running back Kevin Weaver scored
to give W&L the lead and set a school
record for points scored in a career
with 158. With only thirty-two
seconds left in the game, no one
realized that the block of Crabill’s
conversion attempt would end up be-
ing the deciding factor, except
maybe Fallon, who told one of his
players that ‘‘It’s not over yet!”

The box score of the game reported
that the winning touchdown came on
a 2i-yard pass from Hering to
Dillard, but even the Yellow Jackets
would have to admit that the play
didn’t even resemble the diagram in
Coach Blackburn’s playbook.

At least three players touched the
ball after it left Dillard’s hands, and
two of them were wearing blue
shirts. But Hering came down with
the ball, and the Yellow Jacket bench
poured onto the field. After order was
restored, Hering kicked the extra
point to complete the scoring.

After the touchdown play, the
Yellow Jackets had been assessed
two 15 yard unsportsmanlike conduct
penalties on the TD, so Hering had to
kick off from his own ten. Chris Cof-
fland was tackled at midfield, and
the Generals fell by one point for the
second week in a row.

The loss left the Generals looking
ahead to Maryville, the only other
winless team in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference. At first glance,
the Generals would appear to have
an edge, Centre crushed Maryville,
36-14, while W&L lost to Centre by on-
ly a point. But Fallon is reluctant to
draw such comparisions, saying that
the Generals will try to play ‘‘with
the same intensity and the same en-
thusiasm and the same eagerness to
win that we had (last) Saturday.”

This will be Maryville’s home
opener, and Fallon expects the vic-
tory to go to ‘‘the team that wants it
the most.”’

Fallon said the Scots feature a
passing offense with ‘‘super
receivers,’ two talented quarter-
backs, and capable runners. Defen--
sively, Maryville’s main asset is
quickness, said Fallon, although the
Scots do have some size. ‘‘The most
frightening thing about it is that
they’re going to be hungry,...but I
have to think that we’re going to be
just as hungry.”’

HASHMARKS—Fallon was glad to
see Weaver recognized as_ the
Generals’ all-time scoring leader,
but he is certain that the senior run-
ning back ‘‘would have traded in any
kind of individual honors” for a vic-
tory on Saturday. ‘‘That’s the kind of-
individual that Kevin is,” said:
Fallon... Kickoff is set for 1:30 Satur-
day afternoon at Honaker Stadium in
Maryville, Tennessee. W&L leads the
series, 5-4, and won last year, 42-17... :
Head Coach Larry Stephens, a 1972
graduate of Maryville College, is in
his first year with the Scots... Mary-
ville lost last week to Cumberland
College, 34-17...

It’s only

a dream

‘the pie in the sky turned out to be miles too high...”’

—Roger Waters

I was sitting around the other day (avoiding work as usual) just
listening to some tunes, when those words caught my attention. They
brought back to mind visions of my younger days on the playing field
and, suddenly, I realized that this simple phrase summed up my entire
athletic life.

Almost every athlete dreams of becoming a professional or olympic
star at some time or other during his youth. I remember spending
hours on end down in my basement, imagining that I had just thrown a
perfect game in the deciding game of the World Series, or had rushed
for three hundred yards as my team won the Super Bowl. When I was
ten years old, I wouldn’t believe that I would never make it profes-
sionally in one of the many sports I participated in. My goal was to ob-
tain the ultimate pinnacle in athletic competition — superstardom at
the professional level — and then live happily ever after.

I’m sure that many people have felt the same way that I did (come
on, admit it) and also have felt the same foolishness that I feel now
when recalling those past experiences. Hell, I still go up to the gym to-
day and pretend that I’m Larry Bird or Charles Barkley and play out
my fantasies.

Well, get to the point, Shades. What’s all this garbage you’ve been
feeding us really mean anyway?

Look at the quote. ‘‘The pie in the sky’’ is the athlete’s dream.
“Turned out to be miles too high’’ is the realization that the dream will
never come true.

As I got older, the competition got better. I no longer was the star.
Accepting this fact can be difficult, probably the toughest thing I have
ever had to face. Nothing hurts your pride more then someone telling
you that you’re not good enough, especially when that someone is
yourself.

Take a glance at today’s sports figures and it becomes obvious that
even the few who make it big are still posed the identical problem. Do
the names Steve Carlton, Phil Neikro, Pete Rose and Reggie Jackson
ring a bell? These guys refuse to believe that they can’t perform at the
same level at which they once did. The words ‘“‘hanging on’’ and ‘“‘fool-
ing themselves” describe these washouts that should retire. But their
dilemma is the same as mine; it’s just not that simple to give up and
pack it in, Their dreams were attained, but they want them to last
forever.

Deep down in my heart I know that I will never become the great
baseball or basketball player that I strived to be, but I don’t think it’s
all that terrible when I ‘forget’ and relive the dreams all over again.

Does this mean that all athletes should quit when they realize that
they don’t have chance to play professionally? I think not. “Being the
best one can be’’ has always been one of my favorite sayings, and it
really holds true for what an athlete can still accomplish.

So don’t be disappointed if your dreams won’t come true. Work hard,
hustle, and enjoy the sport to its fullest. And hey, being a ‘“‘pretty
good” Division III player ain’t all that bad.

NOTES: Big round of applause for all of you who stayed and sup-

Carver: spare, stunning art

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Entertainment Editor

 

Raymond Carver writes about the
kind of people most of us ignore. His
characters (and frequently his nar-
rators) are out of work, out of luck,
out of booze, or some variation of the
three. They speak a language that is
incapable of expressing what they
are going through. And that, more
often than not, is the point. Out of
these elements, Raymond Carver
creates stunning, powerful art.

Carver will give a reading next
Wednesday at 8 p.m. at Lee Chapel
and the event is cause for celebra-
tion. His sparse, unforgettable short
stories have earned him a huge,
dedicated following and have in-
fluenced a generation of young
writers. Tom Jenks, in the October
1986 issue of Vanity Fair, wrote that
Carver has been instrumental in pro-
mpting what some have called ‘‘a
short story renaissance in this coun-
try.”

Because Carver is also a poet,
much of his prose takes on the
cadence of poetry. He is at his best
when he writes in the first person,
allowing his hapless narrator to pain-
fully describe, in a language so real it
is startling, what exactly went
wrong. (In Carver’s stories, some-
thing always seems to go wrong.)

His imagery is memorable because
he takes elements from the everyday
and makes them special, horrifying,
jolting. In ‘Why Don’t You Dance?”’
a man whose wife has left takes all
the furniture from his bedroom and
sets it up, to scale, in his front yard.
In ‘‘Preservation,’’ a man loses his
job, ‘‘freezes himself’’ on the couch,
and finally ‘‘thaws out’’ with a hor-
rific image of spilled water surroun-
ding his bare feet. And in ‘“Cathe-
dral,’’ a young man experiences an
unexplainable religious moment
when his wife’s blind friend
“teaches” him to draw the cathe-

drals which are being featured on one
of those dull, late night television
documentaries.

Carver knows this world well. In an
essay called ‘‘Fires,’’ he reveals that
he has been a janitor, delivery man,
sawmill operator, service station at-
tendant, and an alcoholic. Carver is a
relentless prose stylist, but his
stories also go straight to the heart of
the experiences. If Carver ever needs
to defend his spare, stylized tragi-
dramas, his best response, it seems
to me, would be, ‘‘Hey I’ve BEEN
there.”’

He was born in Oregon in 1939 and
attended Chico State University.
There, he met novelist John Gardner,
who encouraged Carver to pursue his
immense talent. He was married and
had a child at a very early age and he
consequently had to hold a series of
odd jobs to make his way. During this
period, he managed to squeeze in
time to write. This is why he became
a short story writer, he writes in
“Fries :" there was simply no time to
devote toa novel.

He began to appear in magazines
like Esquiree and Harper's in 1971.
His first collection of short stores,
“Will You Please Be Quiet,
Please?,’’ was published in 1976 and
earned Carver the National Book
Award.

Since then, he has published three
more short story collections:
“Furious Seasons’’ (1977),’ ‘What
We Talk About When We Talk About
Love”’ (1981) and ‘‘Cathedral’’
(1983). In addition, he has published
five volumes of verse, a screen play
and a drama. His most recent pub-
lished work was ‘‘Intamacies,” a
short story that appeared in Esquire
last summer.

Carver was a Guggenheim Fellow
in 1979, has been twice awarded
grants by the National Endowment
for the Arts, and has taught at the
University of lowa, the University of
Texas, and the University of Califor-
nia.

The same old sick routine?

 

By ALANE JAMES
Movie Critic

 

Practically everybody has faked
he old “‘sick routine”’ to avoid going
oschool. Ferris Bueller, on the other
iand, takes it one step further, rais-
ng it toanart form.

While funny at times, ‘Ferris
3ueller’s Day Off’’ is, for the most
vart, a rather poor attempt at com-
‘dy. Ferris Bueller (Mathew Broder-
ck) is the epitome of the over-con-
ident jerk who has never gotten
aught — at anything. Liked by
Imost all the different clique at
chool, he is the apple of his mother’s
ye. You know, the boy next door. So
vhen he feigns illness to skip school,
he only two people who catch on to
im are his sister, Jean, and the
vean of Students, Ed Rooney.

Thus we have the premise for this
e-working of the Tom Sawyer myth.
‘ecause, in the end that’s exactly
‘hat Ferris Bueller is: Tom Sawyer

for the MTV generation. Instead of
going fishing with Huck, however,
Ferris commandeers a 1961 Ferrari
and embarks on an unrealistic quest
for a good time.

The journey starts off innocently
enough — he manages to spring his
girlfriend from class by posing as her
father. From this point, the movie
progresses from the unlikely to the
ridiculous. For instance, in a town
the size of Chicago, are we really to
believe that Ferris runs into his
father three times during the course
of the afternoon without getting
caught? And exactly how did he
manage to worm his way onto a par-
ade float?

As in other John Hughes’ teen epics
(“Breakfast Club’ and ‘‘Sixteen
Candles’), adults are reduced to
bumbling idiots. Dean of Students Ed
Rooney is no exception, for it is he
whom Ferris must outwit. Rooney’s
obsession with catching Ferris drives
him to the point of attempting to
break and enter the Bueller house-
hold, where he provokes the wrath of

the family dog. Granted, he takes
things to the extreme; but c’mon,
he’s just trying to do his job. The au-
dience never hates him enough to
really enjoy all of the bad things that
happen to him.

The film’s saving grace is the
subplot involving Ferris’ friend,
Cameron Frye. Only Cameron grows
during the course of the movie. At the
outset, he is an insecure rich kid
dominated by an overbearing, ma-
terialistic father (a typical ‘“Hughe-
sian” effect). By the end, however,
Cameron has metamorphosed into a
secure individual ready to deal with
his father. This one aspect of the film
is treated with affection and grace
and seems completely out of place in
this shallow romp.

In the final analysis, ‘Ferris
Bueller’s Day Off” tries too hard to
be funny. The film seems prepared to
take off at any moment, but instead
flounders around in mediocrity. Ser-
iously — I can get this kind of enter-
tainment on ‘‘Family Ties’,”’ and it’s
free.

EC will not endorse
trial support group

 

By VALERIE PIERSON
Staff Reporter
Pc

 

| The Executive Committe on Mon-
day night refused to endorse the pro-
posed support group for students ac-
cused of honor violations. In a
unanimous vote, EC members decid-
ed against Dr. James Worth’s pro-
posal, but they encouraged him not to
abandon the idea completely.

Dr. Worth began the discussion
Monday night by inviting the EC
Members to participate in the sup-
Port group in any capacity they

thought necessary.

Jim Humphreys, the third-year
law representative, asked if this
8roup could give the faculty any con-
trol over the honor system. Worth
Tesponded ‘‘absolutely not.” He said
this group’s sole purpose would be to

1 compassionately with students
harged with honor violations.

Louise Phipps-Senft, the second-

ear law representative, questioned

need for such a group. She
inted out that there are other
eans of emotional support, in-
luding dormitory counselors and the
fessionals employed by the uni-
ersity,

In an interview, junior represen-

tive Brad Root echoed these ideas.

Ost people accused of honor viola-

ns would prefer the support and

 

dvice of close friends over that of a

jomplete stranger, he said. After

consulting classmates, Root said he
thought the general consensus was
that better means of handling the
stress surrounding honor trials ex-
isted, making the support group un-
necessary.

Senior representative Baltzer Le-
Jeune, said he could not support the
proposal because it was too loosely
defined. He recommended that Dr.
Worth work with concerned students
and EC members to write some
guidelines for the group. Included in
the guidelines would be the respon-
sibilities of the peer counselors, as
well as the specific role that Dr.
Worth would play.

EC President Shayam Menon said
he thought Worth’s intentions in
starting the group were good. But he
was unable to support the idea as it
was set forth for several reasons.

First, when a person is charged
with an honor violation, he is given a
list of people to contact for legal ad-
vice. According to Menon, the people
on this list are both the most qualified
and the most experienced in honor
defenses. Therefore, he did not
understand why the accused would
need a member of the support group
for technical advice.

Menon stressed the merits of the
existing support system, noting that
dorm counselors, friends, university
psychologists, and legal advisors all
‘were available for emotional-sup-—
‘port.

In other EC action:

The committee approved part of a
proposal to be submitted to the facul-
ty in their October meeting which
suggests changes in several student
committees. Submitted by the mem-
bers of the University Council, the
motion called for changes not only in
that committee, but also in the Stu-
dent Conduct Committee and the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee.

One part of the proposal said the
University Council should be dissolv-
ed next September, 1987. The UC’s
duties would be handled by the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee. This was
passed by the EC.

Another part suggested that the
composition of SAC be changed to in-
clude the president of the student
body, the president of the Student
Bar Association and three elected
representatives from the student
body. The chairman of the SCC and
the president of the Interfraternity
Council would therefore become non-
voting members of SAC. This would
be a change from the current com-
position of SAC, which is the presi-
dent of the student body, the presi-
dent of the Student Bar Association,
the chairman of the Student Conduct
Committee, the president of the In-
terfraternity Council, and the head
dormitory counselor. This part was
not adopted because the current
system is more representative, and it

wpe hea, fair if changed, the.

* committee said.

Each are between forty-five and six-
ty minutes in length. Each produc-
tion has an underlying theme, which,
coupled with brief dialogue, ties the
songs together. The group’s uni-
queness is that each member is in-
volved in the creative process. Ideas
are gathered from the group and are
organized into a skeleton script. This
script is then used to catalize im-
provisation at rehearsals. It is this
improvisation that results in the pro-
duction numbers.

David Nave, a 1986 graduate of
Washington and Lee, has _ been
elected to serve as the first year law
representative to the Executive Com-
mittee. Nave said that he has greatly
benefited from the Honor System
during his years a Welo—and-he
would like to put something back into
the system so that others might bene-
fit from it as well.

Anative of Oak Ridge, Tenn., Nave
was very active during his
undergraduate years. He was a
member of Sigma Phi Epsilon frater-
nity and played on the varsity men’s
tennis team. In addition to writing for
the Ring-tum Phi, Nave also worked
in the Reeves Center, where he was
responsible for organizing artistic
displays in the University Library.

As a result of his work in the
Reeves Center, Nave was given the
oppurtunity to work with a world
renowned collection of Chinese
porcelain, which dates back to the
seventeenth century. As a result, he
became interested in ceramic art,
and wrote a paper about the ceramic
art forms in Hogarth’s prints, an
original area of study.

When asked why he chose to return
to W&L for three additional years of
school, Nave cited several reasons.
First and foremost, Nave stressed

Vocal direction for the student-run
group is handled by junior Craig
Smith. Choreography and publicity
are handled by sophomore Elisabeth
Fowler. Other members of the group
are Christie Davis and Michelle
Brockman, sopranos; Susan Crouse
and Monica Burke, altos; Craig
Smith and Kevin Struthers, tenors;
Louis Cela, baritone; Steve Doran,
bass; and Pierson, accompanist.
Albert C. Gordon, head of the fine
arts department at W&L, serves as
faculty adviser.

the good reputation associated with
W&L, as well as the small, close-knit
community in which it is located.
Also important to him is the manner
in which classes are conducted: pro-
fessors are not only accessible, but
they encourage discussion in and out
of the classroom between student and
teacher.

Additionally, Nave liked the size of

Lexington, saying, “lf you have to:

live in a large city, then the possibili-
ty of problems is greater.’

Finally, Nave emphasized the at-
mosphere of trust at W&L that is
made possible by the Honor System.
He decided to run for the EC due to
his appreciation and respect of the
Honor System. He felt qualified
because of his familiarity with the
Honor System, and his desire to
represent his class on the committee.

“The Honor System deserves some
sort of commitment,’ he said.
Because he is committed to the ideals
of the Honor System, he feels he can
represent his class well.

When asked what his views were on
the use of fake identification cards,
Nave said, ‘‘I don’t see how it can be
construed in any other way than ly-
ing.” He feels it would be hypo-
critical to profess to believe in the
Honor System, while at the same
time condoning the use of something
that is a direct misrepresentation of
oneself. He also repeated the EC’s
policy of taking each case on its own

merit.

As a former staff reporter of the
Ring-tum Phi, Nave was aware of the
past controversy surrounding what
may be printed in the newspaper con-
cerning open honor trials. Since only
members of the W&L community are

. permitted to attend open honor trials,

Nave feels that reporting the facts in
the newspaper would open the Honor
System to scrutiny of individuals who
should not be concerned with it.

“The system is ours. It is our con-
cern. We don’t ask anyone to ad-
minister it for us,” he explained.
Simultaneously, Nave recognized
that one of the purposes of the school
newspaper is to provide a forum to
breed student opinion. He said ‘‘for
the Honor System to be a success,
you must have continual student
debate.’’ His general feelings,
however, are that it would be ideal to
stir up student opinion without in-
volving those who are non- members
of the W&L community.

As for changes he would like to see
made this year, Nave commented
that he first needs to familiarize
himself with all the aspects of the
EC, including the various powers and
responsiblities it possesses. At that
point, he will be able to have a better
idea of how to best represent the
members of his class and to advocate
any desirable changes.

ry concert, coed comedy highlight ’86 Homecoming

ABC bans beer

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Entertainment Editor

 

It looks like it’s going to be Coke
and Sprite for tomorrow night’s
General Public concert.

According to Student Activities
Board Chairman Glyn Alexander,
the SAB will not be selling beer at
Friday night’s Student Activities
Pavilion concert as it was not able to
obtain a beer license from the
Alcoholic Beverage Control Board.

“This is not necessarily the policy
for the whole year,” Alexander said.
“It is just for this show.”’

He said that the dispute over the
license hinged on the definition of a
“closed party featuring the Wash-
ington and Lee community.” The
ABC was willing to grant the SAB a
license provided the concert be at-
tended only by W&L students, their
dates and a handful of invited guests.
This constituted the ABC’s definition
of “the W&L community,” Alex-
ander said.

‘We all consider the girls’ schools
as part of the- W&L community,”
Alexander explained. ‘‘According to
the ABC ruling, carloads of girls
would no longer be considered in-
vited guests.”

He emphasized that it did not mat-
ter, according to ABC policy, that the
SAB was selling tickets to the event.

“In order to get a beer license, it
simply had to be a closed party
featuring the W&L community,” he

said. “We couldn’t come to terms this
time about that.”

Cokes and Sprite will be available
at the concert and will be sold by the
SAB. No coolers will be admitted,
however.

He also said that nobody who
seems to be “‘blatantly drunk”’ will be
admitted. A valid college I.D. will be
required.

Alexander was aware that alcohol
will probably be snuck in and he an-
nounced that the SAB will confiscate
any flasks they see.

“Someone with a flask will not
necessarily be thrown out,’’ Alex-
ander explained. ‘‘We’ll just take the
flask.”

On the other hand, he said that
anyone seen to be causing a great
deal of trouble will be asked to leave.

He said tickets are selling about as
well as expected, despite the new rul-
ing. Pre-concert ticket sales, how-
ever, are usually not a very good in-
dicator of eventual attendance.

“Not many people buy their tickets
in advance. They usually buy them at
the door. Last year’s R.E.M. concert
was an exception,’’ he said.

Alexander thought that this beer
restriction will, in the end, probably
affect attendance at tomorrow
night’s concert.

“It may affect this one, sure: but
as time goes on, people will have to
accept the fact that, at some events,
there will simply be no alcohol,” he
said.

 

 
OPINION

The Ring-tum Phi, October 16, 1986

General hospital

It happens every year. You catch a cold or wake up with a
sore throat and have to make that dreaded trip to the Student
Health Center, otherwise known as the Infirmary. You walk
in and there are about a dozen people in front of you. It’s
doubtful that you will be able to make it to your next class on
time. You mutter to yourself, ‘‘Surely there must be a better
way.”

Several complaints about the Infirmary have been heard
along the Colonnade. First, the lines are long. The waiting
area is not very suited for privacy. Often it’s possible to hear
the doctor-patient conversation all the way out in the waiting
area. If you want to ask the nurse a question, you have to ask
it in front of everyone who is waiting. Many times there isn’t
enough seating space, and it seems likely that a person could

97 up a worse illness than the one they came to see the doc-
tor for.

Secondly, the Health Center is often accused of handing out
drugs or prescriptions without really taking the time to find
out what’s wrong with the patient. Several students I know
went to the Infirmary repeatedly for a certain illness. Each
time the students received a new bottle of pills or syrup and
the advice, “‘Let’s try this and see how it works.” This ap-
proach to curing a medical problem seems haphazard, and
chances for success seem slim.

A related complaint is that the doctor makes a very brief
examination (averaging six minutes), and then hands the
student a prescription to “‘try.”” Again, the cause is too many
patients. If 20 or so students are waiting and the doctor is in
for only an hour and a half or two hours the examination for
each student is short.

As our Infirmary operates now, Dr. Feddeman comes in
each morning for about two hours to see patients, and Dr.
Pickral is there for an hour and a half each afternoon. This
system allows both doctors to have private practices in town,
and it also allows the students to get another opinion without
having to go outside the Infirmary services. If students are
dissatisfied with the diagnosis they received from one of the
doctors, or just seem to have a personality conflict with a
particular doctor, they are free to go to the other doctor for
further care.

The problem with the present arrangement is that since the
doctor is only here for a short time, everyone must see him at
that time, and long lines are the result.

I talked with both Dr. Feddeman and Dr. Pickral. I wanted
to find out their response to these complaints.

Both said they have noticed an increase in patients coming
to the Health Center since the University started admitting
women. The reason appears not to be that women get sicker
more easily than men, but that often women are more health-
conscious and less willing just to “suffer through” a cold. Dr.
Feddeman said the majority of the illnesses (affecting ap-
proximately 80% of all those who come to the Infirmary) are
upper-respiratory infections (colds) or gastro-intestinal ill-
ness (stomach flu or upset stomach).

The move to coeducation has prompted the Student Health
Center to offer some new services, namely pelvic exams and
prescriptions for birth control or fittings for diaphrams
(sorry guys, you still have to go to the drugstore). Dr. Fed-
deman, who is retiring at the end of this year, also says that
the University hopes to hire a woman physician by next fall
ood = students who may feel uncomfortable with a male

octor.

Dr. Feddeman expressed some concern over the growing
number of patients coming into the Infirmary, and the
limited number of beds available. Certainly, it seems, as
more women arrive on campus, the Student Health Center
will get busier and busier. Surely the University will have to
expand the hours in which a doctor is available or hire a full-
time physician and expand the Health Center’s facilities.

All things considered, the Health Center does the best it
can. It is humanly possible to see only so many students in an
hour and a half to two hour period. The Center is open 24
hours a day, although you might have to wait to be cared for
if the nurse is in the infirmary side taking care of those
restricted to their beds. Sometimes the bedside manner is not
the best in the world, but then again we are supposed to be
adults now who don’t need to be babied every time we get the
sniffles (the service-with-a-smile guarantee is only at
McDonald’s).

Perhaps subsequent changes in the staff will alleviate
some of the complaints of long lines and short examinations.
Perhaps if the doctors have more time to spend with each pa-
tient, they could make more accurate diagnoses and subse-
quent prescriptions, instead of seemingly giving every
medicine a “try” until one finally works. Until that time,
however, the student body will just have to muddle through
on Dimetapp and cough drops.

Student has loyalty to W&L

 

MY VIEW
By Jennifer Spreng

 

I can’t even begin to tell you how
ready for Homecoming I am.

I’m excited for the party, but that

isn’t really why I can hardly wait for
the big weekend.

General Public ought to be good

too, but I’d still be excited even if
they weren’t coming.

The real reason I’m so ready is the
football game. I intend to watch
every second of that ball game. I
know we're going to beat Hampden-
Sydney. We simply have to.

You see, I grew up in Hampden-
Sydney. If someone was writing my
biography, he’d say I spent my for-
mative years there,

I’ve always loved Hampden-Syd-
ney. I have enough memories of that
place to last a lifetime, that’s for
sure. I even have a sweatshirt, which
I have daringly worn around the
campus here. (The freshmen don’t
seem to care, but I get some of the
most interesting looks from the up-
perclassmen. )

Ahbh!! My confused loyalties!

At least, I thought my loyalties
-were confused.
I road tripped to H-SC this past
weekend. It was great to see my

friends again, but I was glad to get
back to W&L.

In five weeks, W&L has inspired as
much affection in me as Hampden-
Sydney did in four years.

Washington and Lee is not, and will
never be, just a school where you
spend four years of your life. W&L is
not a place to live, but a way of life.

I like this way of life.

It’s an intangible element that sets
W&L apart from so many schools
about which I’ve seen and heard.
Bound up in the attitudes of the peo-
ple, the honor system and the rela-
tionship we have with the town, there
is a challenge worth meeting. Only in
meeting this challenge can we really
ee ee eee &
er.

Some of my friends from the big
Northeastern cities say that it’s a
challenge to live for four years in a
small Virginia town. If they feel that
way, they were lucky that they chose
Lexington.

With so many services provided
through the community, like the post
office and religious opportunities, we
become part of a bigger community
here than just the college. It has in-
stilled in me a sense of responsibility
to this place, and I don’t think that
I’m the only one.

A student has to have a lot of

responsibility to survive W&L. Be-
tween renting a telephone and then
receiving the shock of the first bill, I
know that I have a lot to learn!

Even though mommy isn’t here to
forbid them, eventually I am going to
cut back on my long distance calls. It
may have been expensive, but it
meant a lot to learn that lesson on my
own.

Maybe that’s the biggest adjust-
ment that a freshman has to make—
learning how to take care of oneself
by setting priorities.

W&L is a good place to develop
those abilities. From handling a
telephone to respecting the honor
system, this place is molding in-
dividuals (as the old saying goes)
who will work hard, play hard
and...well, never mind.

You know what I mean.

W&L is creating gentlepeople. My
class of 1990, like the many classes
before us, and undoubtedly like the
many classes to come, will be a
group of well-rounded, responsible
adults. That’s because we will have
lived that life for four years.

Sound like a strange reason to be
looking forward to the Generals
whipping the Tigers on Saturday? It
isn’t really. W&L is my home, my
loyalties are invested here, and I’m
ready to be proud of it.

 

Honor?

MY VIEW
By Mark Farley

 

 

When Robert E. Lee was president
of Washington College, a new student
approached him, asking him about
the rules of the college. President
Lee is supposed to have replied that
there were no written or codified
rules. It was only expected that a stu-
dent conduct himself as a gentlemar
at all times. '

T’ll just pause here for a momey’
and allow that to sink in.

An English professor at Washing-
ton and Lee is fond of saying that tie
past is like another country: things
are done differently there. Indeed,
this is quite true. One hundred 0:
even 50 years ago, if you made ar
rangements to meet with someone,
he was there at the expected hour:
Now, you find yourself having to wait
20 or more minutes for the person to
arrive, if he arrives at all. The next
day, if you are lucky, the person
might shout to you across the Colon-
nade about how he had to get lunch
and catch ‘‘All My Children,”’ when
he was suppposed to be meeting with
you. He ends his yelling by promising
that he will try to catch up with you
later. And so, you continue on, not
knowing whether he means it.

In the past, giving your word
meant something. Now, I am not so
sure. The principal difference is that
honor used to encompass the concept
of acting like a gentleman or lady.
Now, with the tunnel vision of the
1980s, we see honor as including only
three facets: not lying, not cheating,
and not stealing. If we avoid these
three, we feel that our conscience is
clear, regardless of the actual nature
of our behavior and actions.

All too often, we are gentlemen and
ladies of convenience. In other
words, we are gentlemen and ladies
when it pleases or benefits us. When
we want to cash an out-of-state
check, get something on credit, or
have our word taken as the truth, we'
point proudly to President Lee’s
words and the Honor System and
then flash the clerk a bright and
reassuring smile. But when we want
to relax, kick back with our friends
and drink some beer, the concept of
gentlemanly conduct is hung up and
put away as if it were some cumber-
some and antiquated costume that no
longer fits.

Every week, this newspaper is full
of examples: obscenities and beer
are tossed at policemen as well as at
other students, individuals are ver-
bally abused, walls in fraternity
houses and dorms are punched and
kicked in and countless panes of
glass are shattered. All this is in the
name of fun and relaxation. Each
year, vandalism costs us, the
Washington and Lee community,
thousands of dollars. Yes, even at
W&L the concept of weekday gentle-
men is alive and well.

Let us not be so foolish as to think
that our disrespect for property is on-'
ly alcohol induced. The music depart-
ment has had recurrent problems
with pianos being vandalized. Disket-
tes and templates for Word Perfect
and Lotus programs disappear from
the stands by the computers. If these
are examples are not convincing
enough, you only have to take a look
around campus and read the writing
on the walls, as it were. One must
certainly wonder what sort of
gentleman plans his social ‘“en-
counters” on the bathroom stalls.

Although there is a concept of
honor at Washington and Lee, one
must wonder how clear a perception
we have of it. I once saw it written
that “‘Honor should be restored to
W&L!”’ Of course, this ‘‘noble’’
assertion was tainted by the fact that
it was deeply gouged on the library's
elevator door.

Reykjavik and lost opportunities: Is SDI worth it?

 

MY VIEW
By Paul J. Smith

 

As we sit back and try to figure out
what went wrong in Reykjavik,
Iceland, we can be assured of one
thing: SDI (Strategic Defense In-
itiative) has assumed a new rank and
role in U.S.-Soviet relations, Never
before have arms control discussions
rested so clearly on one issue.

For the sake of SDI and its deploy-
ment, the United States has missed
an unprecedented opportunity to cut
in half the number of ICBM’s within
the next 10 years, and to reduce the
number of intermediate-range
weapons to zero.

Why did we give up this opportuni-
ty?

The price would have been keeping
SDI confined to the laboratory, which
Reagan claims would have killed the
SDI program altogether. Because of
the secrecy surrounding the SDI pro-
gram, it is impossible to argue
beyond an educated guess whether
this is true or not. But one thing is

clear; SDI has emerged as the major
barrier to improved U.S.-Soviet rela-
tions, and as such should be scrutiniz-
ed by every tax-paying American for
the cost involved in such a Herculean
program. The question thus be-
comes, “Is SDI worth the costs: not
only the costs of missed opportunities
in Iceland, but also the larger
economic costs associated with the
mammoth budgetary needs of SDI?”

According to defense department
statistics, a total of $27 billion has
been allocated for the five-year
period beginning with 1985. If SDI is
implemented to its fullest extent,
however, the cost could run as high
as $1 trillion for a technologically ex-
otic multitiered system including
necessary management and com-
munication facilities. While sup-
porters of SDI argue that such an ex-
penditure would be spread out over
many years, the price is staggering,
nevertheless.

The second question that must be
addressed concerns the role of SDI.
Initially SDI was a government
research effort designed to examine
advanced technologies to build an ef-
fective defense against ballistic
missiles. Up until now, the goal of
this research has simply been to

determine the feasibility of such a
program. Supporters and critics of
SDI research have seen the program
as a bargaining chip to receive
serious concessions from the Soviets.

The reasoning goes like this: if we
conduct research in SDI, the Soviets
will be more willing to talk, and offer
more substantial cuts in their offen-

sive nuclear arsenal.
And in fact it has worked. In
Geneva. In Iceland. In both

meetings, the fact that SDI was a ma-
jor concern to the Soviets was evi-
dent in the proposals put forth by the
Soviets. This was true in Iceland
especially, where the Soviets were
willing to compromise not only in the
area of arms-reductions, but also in
the area of human rights.

So why doesn’t the United States
take advantage of this? After all it
does not seem logical to spend $27
billion on SDI research without reap-
ing some tangible benefits, such as
reduction in the number of ICFM’s or
Intermediate Range Missiles on both
sides — unless SDI is to be upgraded
into the deployment stage, in which
case we've got a whole new ball-
game.

If this becomes the case, then the
United States must seriously scru-

tinize SDI for what it is, and what 1
will be. Those factors that should be
considered include: costs, potential
Soviet response (such as stockpiling
of offensive weapons, or building a
‘Soviet SDI), efficacy of SDI, impact
‘on strategic parity.

There is not much time. The United
States and Soviet Union are at the
threshold of a new era in East-West
relations. We can choose to use SDI
as it was originally intended-to serve
as a bargaining tool with which the
U.S. could effectively work with the
Soviet Union in bringing about a
meaningful arms-control agreement
and an environment within which
cultural and social exchange could
take place.

Our other alternative is to
unilaterally embark on the most ex-
pensive, resource-exhausting and
complex projects ever attempted in
the history of humankind, thus in-
itiating a whole new kind of arms
race, the ramifications of which will
be felt far and wide, in every corner
of the globe—economically, political-
ly, militarily. This will be the Pan-
dora’s box to top all Pandora’s boxes.
And then when we finally realize
what we’ve done, it will be too late.

BV men arrested

 

By PETER BOATNER
Staff Reporter

 

Six Washington and Lee students
were the victims of burglary in the
past week, and Lexington police ar-
rested two Buena Vista men in con-
nection with three of the charges,
Lexington City Police reports said.

The suspect was apprehended by
police at about 2:30 a.m. on Sunday,
police reports said, after being sur-
rounded by several W&L students in-
cluding Michael Carroll, who said he
found the suspect in his room at the
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity
house.

Jeffrey D. Anderson, 19, of 733 E.
24th St. and Tony T. Dudley, 21, of
1406 Maple Lane, both of Buena
Vista, were charged with burglary

 

Closed street O

West Washington Street will be
reopened for through traffic by Oct.
30, according to Billy Walker, con-
struction supervisor for the J. M.
Turner Co.

The street was closed from Warner
Center to the Gaines Residence Hall
construction site on Nelson Street so
that underground steam lines could
be laid to the new dormitory. Con-
struction on the dormitory began last
spring.

In addition to traffic problems, the
construction project has caused
other inconveniences as well. Noise
is a particular nuisance to nearby
residents and students. Work begins
each day at 7 a.m. with the accompa-
nying sounds of bulldozers and
jackhammers.

D.J. Hatfield, a sophomore resi-
dent of the International House at 2
West Washington St., said he is never
able to sleep later than 6:30 or 7 a.m.
He also said that workers place their
lunchboxes on the porch and use his
hammock without permission.

The residents of the International
House did, however, reap one benefit
from the construction — it gave them
a theme for their “Hole in the Front
Yard” party.

and grand larceny.

Earlier in the week two other SAE
members, Hugh White and Clement
Klank, had noticed items missing
from their rooms at the house, which
they reported to the police following
the incident involving Carroll.

White reported $250 worth of
cassette tapes and a $15 tape carry-
ing case missing, and Klank reported
$105 worth of tapes, $60 worth of ties,
$20 worth of cologne, a $30 racquet-
ball racquet and a duffle bag gone
from his room, police records said.

Following police investigation of
these new charges, Anderson was ar-
rested a second time early on the
morning of Oct. 13. He was charged
with burglary and a grand larceny in
these two cases.

Anderson is currently on probation

Guest House on West Washington

construction. Although her weekend
spaces are booked, she said, tourists
no longer carry the weeknight busi-
ness. She also said she has been
bothered by dust from the construc-
tion site blowing into her house.

Walker said he would talk to the
workers about using the Interna-
tional House porch. He also said that
the site is watered down each even-
ing to minimize the amount of dust.
Because of the work schedule, the

Other victims of theft were John K.

1980 Honda sometime on Oct. 11 or 12.
He had left the car at 201 E. Washing-

The construction project on
Washington Street was originally
scheduled to be completed by Sept.
30. Walker explained that the site’s
uneven grade and clay-like soil were
to blame for the delay.

Frank A. Parsons, executive assis-
tant to the president, is not worried
about the delay. Parsons, who has
been involved in the design of the new
dormitory, said the Turner Co. pro-
jected that the construction on
Washington Street could be com-

No run, Steve, no run.

“The Steve and Spot Story,” 1986

Hobbling around Lexington the
past few weeks has been a pain in
more than just the ankle.

First came the questions:

“So did you fall off a barstool?”’

“Did the guys on your hall beat
you up?”

“Were you fending off freshmen
females as they ferociously ripped
at your clothes?”

Then came the answer:

“Unfortunately, no. I was just
running down a hill in a cross
country time trial and sprained
my ankle.”’

People stared at my foot and
asked how long it would be until it
fell off. There was talk of my pos-
ing with Ham Smith as the jour-
nalism department’s poster child.

W&L Athletic Trainer Tom

 

“Bulldog”? Jones termed my in-
jury a “classic sprain,”’ but unlike
Coca-Cola, “classic”’ is not always
better in the wonderful world of
the walking wounded. I worried
that Coach Jones would mount my
ankle and display it for his ‘‘tapes
and scrapes’ class. I worried
even more when his assistants at-
tached muscle-stimulation elec-
trodes to my foot and submerged
it in a tub of icewater. I’d heard of
borscht, but this cold feet soup
stuff was ridiculous.

Actually, I owe the trainers a
thank-you for a fairly speedy
recovery. Any people willing to
put up with my stinking feet and
stupid jokes twice a day are all
right in my book, even if I’m not
all right in theirs.

It’s easy to notice the problem
when we see someone temporarily
on crutches. But we in the W&L
community must realize the
obstacles faced by those who are

wheelchair-bound or have perma-
nent difficulty walking. Most of
the elevators on campus — and
there aren’t many — need keys.
Our Colonnade is very beautiful,
but those old buildings, with their
steps and steep stairways, hardly
make the handicapped feel
capable.

To solve this problem, campus
leaders should consider adding
more access ramps. We should
replace some of our heavy, swing-
back-in-your-face doors with ones
that meet the needs of the disabl-
ed. Our community leaders must
make it easier to get around the
city.

As W&L continues its transition
into the 20th century, the needs of
the handicapped must be con-
sidered, After all, about the only
real benefit of hobbling around
Lexington is that it’s a good topic
for a human-interest column.

And now even that’s old news.

Washington and Lee University and the local Red
Cross held their fall blood drive Wednesday from 11:00
to 5:00. Chris Martin of Chi Psi and Jon Solomon of
Sigma Nu helped to organize the drive.

Kegs were given to the organizations with the most
members and the highest percentage of participating
members. Chi Psi members worked at the drive and
Sigma Nu members distributed posters and signed up
the donors.

Rockbridge County is experiencing a shortage of
blood, and all types are needed. The goal this year was
150 pints, with each person usually donating a pint. At
noon, Head Nurse Norma Hancock, said that they were
not experiencing many problems, but the drive was
much slower than last year. Many workers at the drive
commented on the poor turnout. The goal was not
reached, for only 129 pints were donated.

The top five contributing fraternities were Chi Psi,
Fiji, Phi Delta Theta, Sigma Chi, and Sigma Nu. Facul-
ty members, independents and various other school
organizations were also represented. ROTC won the
keg for the most participants, and Phi Delta Theta won
for the highest percentage with 27% of their members
donating blood.

WaA&L receives grant

Washington and Lee University has received a grant
of $50,000 from the Jessie Ball duPont Religious,
Charitable and Educational Fund of Jacksonville, Fla.
The grant will be used for the purchase of equipment for
the University’s science departments.

The duPont Fund was established in duPont’s will
and is designed for the philanthropic support of
religious, charitable and educational activities, notably
in higher education.

A native of Northumberland County, duPont was
awarded an honorary degree from W&L in 1947 in
recognition of her support of higher education and her
benefactions to the University. She was a trustee of
W&L from 1959 until her death in 1970. The duPont
Scholarship Program, the duPont Professorship in
Religion, and duPont Hall, the University’s fine arts
building, are named in Mrs. duPont’s honor.

Dedication to be Saturday

The Chavis House at 10 Lee Ave., one of Washington
and Lee University’s residences for upperclass
students and cultural center for the Minority Student
Association, will be dedicated on Saturday at 4 p.m.

The house was named after John Chavis, the first
black to attend W&L, by the Board of Trustees at its
meeting last February.

Chavis, a widely respected teacher and minister in
the Presbyterian Church, attended Liberty Hall
Academy (now Washington and Lee) in 1795 after
studying at Princeton College. He later moved to North
Carolina where he opened several schools and con-
tinued preaching and writing until his death in 1838.

The first floor of the Chavis House, which serves as
the cultural center, is open to members of the Minority

SPE tangled in cable splitting

 

By PETER BOATNER
Staff Reporter

The Sigma Phi Epsilon house is in
hot water with Lexington Cable Com-
pany, but all parties involved think
the situation will be easily resolved.

According to Gary Judy, manager
of the cable company, SPE has con-
tracted for cable service to one
television set at the house on Preston
Street.

On a routine service check last

week, however, he found splitters
had been installed to divide the signal
for service to 12 televison sets.

Judy sent a registered letter to the
house, asking the members either to
disconnect the splitters or start pay-
ing for 12 sets.

SPE President Russell Whitman
said he doesn’t know when the split-
ters were installed, but that they
have now been disconnected.

“I went through and disconnected
them to the best of my ability, but I

asked them (Lexington Cable) to
come out and check’’ to make sure
they’re all gone, he said.

“We don’t press charges on the
first offense,”’ said Judy. ‘‘We’re go-
ing to wait and see how they handle
this.”

Whitman said the splitters were in
place at the beginning of this year, to
the best of his knowledge. Members
who had sets attached to the cable
were told either to begin paying for
the service or to make sure their
television is disconnected.

While the new grass grows, it’s on-

Liberty Hall will be ready for full:

Approved by the Board of Trustees
in the spring of 1985, the new fields
are scheduled to be completed by the
beginning of the 1987 fall athletic
season. Washington and Lee athletics
will no longer have a shortage of
practice space.

“This has been over many years in
the process,”’ said Associate Director
of Athletics Dick Miller. “We have
always been short of playing fields.”

Wilson Field, Smith Field, and a

of the irrigation water line is $50,000

the remaining cost. The parking area
that was recently constructed was
not included in the field budget and
was funded by other means.

Soccer storms VMI
for 6th straight win

 

By GARY MeCULLOU!
Staff Reporter

A General’s invasion occurred
yesterday at VMI.

The Washington and Lee men’s
soccer team stormed the VMI cam-
pus yesterday and retreated only
after defeating the Keydets by a 2-1
score, Coupled with it’s 2-1 defeat of
Messiah College last Saturday, the
VMI win knocked the General’s
season record up to 7-3.

Both goals in the VMI game were
scored by senior captain Peter Van
Son. His scoring show was backed by
an outstanding team effort which
held the Keydets to only one goal.

After the game, W&L head coach
Rolf Piranian said, “The different
problems we’ve had, we’ve adressed.
I think the team is steadily improv-
ing. The defense is allowing a
minimal number of goals, and the of-
fense is progressing as usual.”

Last weekend’s win over the very
successful Messiah team was also

exciting for the Generals. It was the
team’s fifth straight win, and a very
successful season seems to be just
over the horizon. Junior Chuck Lyle
and sophomore Mike Veliouna scored
goals for the Generals.

Freshman Rick Silva commented
on the defense: ‘There are still some
problems, but, for the most part,
we've corrected them to where they
don’t affect us as much anymore.”
Silva continued, ‘‘We just changed
our style, Our forwards are also play-
ing better defense which makes
things go a lot smoother.”

Silva said that things were going
much better between the backfield
and the midfield, so the offense has
much more opportunity to score.

Now that the team is 7-3, momen-
tum is at an obvious peak. With the
defensive improvement and the of-
fensive aggressiveness, the Generals

should be well equipped for the Senior captain Peter Van Son (4) gives chase to a VMI Keydet in yester-

Scots edge Generals; FB still seeking first win

By JIM LARE
Staff Reporter

Last year at this time the Generals
were in the midst of a six game win-

ning streak that nearly put them into
the NCAA Division ITI playoffs. What
a difference a year makes.

Washington and Lee recorded its
fourth loss in as many games last
Saturday, falling to Maryville Col-
lege by a score of 35-28.

Maryville started the scoring just
four minutes into the game with an
18-yard run by freshman Julio Kilid-
djian, but the Generals quickly
responded with a 26-yard touchdown
pass from Jon Thornton
to wide-out Bobby Wilson. Washing-
ton and Lee scored the only touch-
down of the second quarter on a 77-

yard pass from Thornton to wide-out
Randy Brown, giving the Generals a
14-7 lead at halftime.

Generals head coach Gary Fallon,
remembering last week’s loss to
Randolph-Macon, reminded his
players that ‘‘we have to play a full 60

Ininutes and try to win both halves.”

W&L led or was tied with the Yellow
Jackets for 59:59 last week but lost in
the final second of the game on a ball
batted in the end zone.

But instead of extending the lead,
the Generals turned the ball over ona
fumble by Thornton in their first
possession of the half, and
quickly drove to the W&L 7-yard line.
On first down and goal, the Scots
were assessed a holding penalty, but
on second and seventeen, Maryville’s
junior QB Mike Human hit wide-out
Chris Johannsen to tie the score at 14

with 8:43 remaining in the third
quarter.

Less than three minutes later,
W&L tailback Kevin Weaver scored
his 26th career touchdown on a 13-
yard carry, but the rest of the period
was all downhill for the Generals. On
a subsequent third-down play deep in
Scot territory, Human found wide-out
Bob Echols for a 60-yard gain, and
the ck scored
seconds later on a 4-yard run.

Just seconds later, Thornton was
intercepted by linebacker Jason Har-
bison, and, two plays after that,
Johannsen caught his second touch-
down pass of the day. The score gave
the Scots their first lead, 28-21, and
gave Human seven consecutive com-
pletions for 168 yards and two

touchdowns.

Four minutes into the fourth
quarter, Thornton was intercepted
by cornerback Tyan Shelton, who
returned the pass 38 yards for a
touchdown, the second score given up
by the W&L offense in as many
games. Less than three minutes
later, Weaver pulled the Generals to
within seven on a 39-yard dash with
8:20 . But kicker Mark
Olovic’s PAT proved to be the final
point of the ball game, giving W&L a
35-28 loss and the Scots their first win
of the season.

“We are not a good enough football
team to come back from a 14 point
deficit late in the game,”’ said Fallon.
“We are obviously disappointed. We
had some opportunities to put the
game away, but we didn’t,”’

‘Mental’errors hurt polo

 

From Staff Reports

 

The Washington and Lee water
polo team won two of its four games
at the Northeast Varsity Invitational
last weekend.

Army beat the Generals, 10-8, and
Bucknell continued its dominance
over W&L, 16-9, in the first two
games of the tournament held at
Brown University.

“We made some mental mistakes
against some good teams, but came
back to play good mental polo to win
the last two games,” said head coach
Page Remillard.

Cross country:

In their next two games, the
Generals beat MIT, 15-7, and Ford-
ham, 12-7.

This weekend, the Generals host
the second round of the Southern
League Tournament at Cy Twombly
Pool.

In the first round of the tourna-
ment, the Generals placed second
behind the Richmond Spiders, who
are ranked among the nation’s top
twenty teams.

This weekend, in addition to Rich-
mond, the Generals will face George
Washington, Mary Washington,
Lynchburg and the University of
North Carolina-Wilmington.

By ELIZABETH PARKINS
Staff Reporter

The men’s cross country team im-
proved its record to four and two with
solid wins over American University
and Catholic University at their tri-
meet in Washington, D.C., this past
Saturday.

Led by junior Scott Rippeon who
placed first (26:11), junior Richard
Moore who placed second (26:16),
and senior Ash Andrews who placed
third (26:18), the team scored a low
25 points. American University was a
distant second with 43 points and
Catholic University finished with 58

points.

“We ran right together the whole
race,’ said Andrews, ‘‘but we also
had a lot of support from Joe Geitner

Casker, and Jim Busenleiner

“The fact that these freshmen did
do so well shows that we are coming
together as a team. We are now solid
— being five or six (men) deep,” add-
ed Andrews.

Head Coach Dick Miller was also
pleased with the team’s perfor-
mance. “When you get one, two,
three you can’t ask for much more.
We have probably run, as a team, the
best we’ve run all year,” said Miller.

While the men were in D.C., the
women traveled for the State meet
(Division II and III) at Lynchburg
College. Although they didn’t win.
there was at least one impressive in-
dividual performance. Sophomore

other and that was our goal. We all
stuck together,”’ said Williams.

New playing fields
will give more space

 

By MIKE SHADY
\ssistant Sports Editor

 

While the new grass grows, it’s on-
ly a matter of time before the new
practice/playing fields located at
Liberty Hall will be ready for full
time use

Approved by the Board of Trustees
in the spring of 1985, the new fields
are scheduled to be completed by the
beginning of the 1987 fall athletic
season. Washington and Lee athletics
will no longer have a shortage of
practice space.

‘This has been over many years in
the process,” said Associate Director
of Athletics Dick Miller. “We have
always been short of playing fields.”

Miller said that when he arrived in
1952, the only fields available were
Wilson Field, Smith Field, and a
small practice field that is called
Alumni Field. Since that time, the ad-
ministration has funded the construc-
tion of the New Alumni Field, the
upper-level tennis courts, and the
leveling of a hilly area near the

| baseball field. More progress,
however, was waiting in the wings.

“With the advent of women’s
athletics, we’ve been insisting for
some more fields,” said Miller. ‘‘It’s
a necessity for our teams. We've
wanted to get soccer off the baseball
field, and since W&L athletics as well
as the IM programs have expanded,
more playing fields have been in de-
mand,” he said.

The cost for the total project will
come to about $425,000, with the ma-
jor cost ($180,000) going toward the
actual leveling of the area. The cost
of the irrigation water line is $50,000
and $25,000 is for the fencing. Fine
grading, seeding the field, and the ac-
tual irrigation of the field account for
the remaining cost. The parking area
that was recently constructed was
not included in the field budget and
was funded by other means.

Two major problems with the pre-
sent fields are the poor drainage
system and the overuse. The dirt of
the two alumni fields is hard packed
because of poor drainage, thus pre-
venting complete grass coverage.

Because they are in such short sup-
ply, the fields are used almost year-
round. This again allows the sod little

compound problems, Miller said,
there is also too much clay mixed in
with the soil. The result is a field that
is difficult to water and that burns up
during the summer months.

won’t have that problem with the new

this, they may be the best fields we
will have.”

The fields will be used, Miller said,
by whomever needs them, and use
will rotate from year to year and
from season to season.

The next step, said Miller, will be
the renovation of some, if not all, of
the present playing fields. This, how-
ever, may not happen for quite some
time.

“Hopefully, we will get to the point
where a field will be able to have a
rest so it can remain in good playing
shape,”’ he said.

Randy Brown, giving the Generals a
14-7 lead at halftime.

Generals head coach Gary Fallon,
remembering last week’s loss to
Randolph-Macon, reminded his
players that ‘“‘we have to play a full 60
minutes and try to win both halves.”’
W&L led or was tied with the Yellow
Jackets for 59:59 last week but lost in
the final second of the game on a ball
batted in the end zone.

But instead of extending the lead,
the Generals turned the ball over ona
fumble by Thornton in their first
possession of the half, and Maryville
quickly drove to the W&L 7-yard line.
On first down and goal, the Scots
were assessed a holding penalty, but
on second and seventeen, Maryville’s
junior QB Mike Human hit wide-out
Chris Johannsen to tie the score at 14

with 8:43 remaining in the third
quarter.

Less than three minutes later,
W&L tailback Kevin Weaver scored
his 26th career touchdown on a 13-
yard carry, but the rest of the period
was all downhill for the Generals. On
a subsequent third-down play deep in
Scot territory, Human found wide-out
Bob Echols for a 60-yard gain, and
the Maryville quarterback scored
seconds later on a 4-yard run.

Just seconds later, Thornton was
intercepted by linebacker Jason Har-
bison, and, two plays after that,
Johannsen caught his second touch-
down pass of the day. The score gave
the Scots their first lead, 28-21, and
gave Human seven consecutive com-
pletions for 168 yards and two

touchdowns.

Four minutes into the fourth
quarter, Thornton was intercepted
by cornerback Tyan Shelton, who
returned the pass 38 yards for a
touchdown, the second score given up
by the W&L offense in as many
games. Less than three minutes
later, Weaver pulled the Generals to
within seven on a 39-yard dash with
8:20 remaining. But kicker Mark
Olovie’s PAT proved to be the final
point of the ball game, giving W&L a
35-28 loss and the Scots their first win
of the season.

“We are not a good enough football
team to come back from a 14 point
deficit late in the game,” said Fallon.
“We are obviously disappointed. We
had some opportunities to put the
game away, but we didn’t.”

The men’s cross country team im-

solid wins over American University
and Catholic University at their tri-

Saturday.

Led by junior Scott Rippeon who
placed first (26:11), junior Richard
Moore who placed second (26:16),
and senior Ash Andrews who placed
third (26:18), the team scored a low
25 points. American University was a
distant second with 43 points and
Catholic University finished with 58
points.

“We ran right together the whole

General Public are

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Entertainment Editor

 

Let’s get one thing straight from
the outset: General Public is not the
English Beat. Nor are they the Fine
Young Cannibals. For that matter,
General Public is not Public Image
Ltd., either. Which reminds me that
Public Image Ltd. is not, incidental-
ly, the Sex Pistols. Public Image Ltd.
certainly isn’t the English Beat,
either.

Got that straight?

General Public, featuring former
English Beat leaders Dave Wakeling
and Ranking Roger, will roll into
town tomorrow night for a perfor-
mance at the Student Activities
Pavilion—that we can definitely get
straight. Tickets for the show are $8
and will be sold until showtime. The
opening act, the Buddy System, will
kick off festivities promptly at 9:15,
and General Public should hit the
stage around 10:30. That is almost
certain.

One thing that was certain about
the English Beat, however, was that
they certainly were good. Their three
albums — “Just Can’t Stop It,”
‘“‘Wha’ppen?”’ and ‘‘Special Beat Ser-
vice’ — were delicious pop/ska con-
coctions brimming with irresistible
rhythm, soul and exuberance. A Beat
song started at your toes, slid
through your abdomen, and crawled
into your brain. And nine times out of
10, that’s exactly where it stayed for
several days: bouncing around in
your head like an impatient dance
partner.

But it hath been said that all good
things come to an end, And according
to former Beat and current General
Public lead vocalist Dave Wakeling,
the Beat bit the dust for four distinct
reasons: ‘‘Exhaustion, greed, anger
and stupidity.”

NELSON STREET

Nelson Street

So, on the verge of almost guaran-
teed American success, the mighty
English Beat disbanded. Wakeling
and fellow Beat singer/songwriter
Ranking Roger wasted no time,
however, and immediately began
forming General Public. A year of
writing and rehearsing produced an
exciting debut LP called ‘‘...All the
Rage” and General Public picked up,
in both sound and approach, exactly
where the Beat left off. An infectuous
Top 30 hit, ‘“Tenderness,’’ and a No. 1
year-end dance record, ‘‘Never You
Done That,” immediately establish-
ed General Public as an act to be
reckoned with.

Whereas the Beat, however, waxed
political on frequent occasion (their
notorious ‘Stand Down Margaret”
was a sinister attack on Margaret
Thatcher’s dubious economic
policies of the early ’80’s, for exam-
ple), General Public tends to address
more general (no pun intended) and
less controversial topics.

“As the times get more conser-
vative, you feel that if you want to
make a point, then perhaps you have
to couch it in terms that will help it
get through,”’ Wakeling has said. ‘If
we're to bring out “Stand Down
Margaret” in England now, it would
never get played on the radio
anyway, so what’s the point?”

Mick Jones, current guiding force
for Big Audio Dynamite (who is not,
by the way, the Clash, but that’s a dif-
ferent story entirely) was rumored to
have joined General Public back in
the group’s embryonic stage, but on-
ly ended up appearing as a ‘‘guest
star’’ on ‘“‘... All The Rage.”

The guys have just unleashed their
second I.R.S. LP, ‘‘Hand To Mouth,”
as well as a catchy, hook-laden single
called ‘“‘Too Much Or Nothing.”’ The
album continues in the same vein as
‘All The Rage’’ with added pop

punch and a more secure sense of

Two new members have joined the
Public — Gianni and Mario Minardi.
The brothers were part of a ska/rock
band called the Basics, who opened
up for General Public last year. So

they persuaded the Minardis into
“going public,” as it were.

and Roger became fathers, then pro-

Shawn and Sidney Burton. Whew!

“Something to do with fertile im-
aginations,”’ Wakeling said.

“Sorry if you’ve had to wait, but if
you’ve got a problem, take it up with
the babies, not us,” quipped Ranking
Roger.

IFC bans the press
from its meetings

 

By STACY MORRISON
Staff Reporter

 

 

 

THE SNAG

After only limited discussion, the
Interfraternity Council voted 11-1
Tuesday night to prohibit Ring-tum
Phi reporters from attending its
meetings. Five fraternities abstained
from voting.

IFC President Chris Saxman said
the negative attitude toward the
press was the result of ‘‘bad press up
until this date. None of the guys want
negative stuff about their fraternities
printed on the front page.”’

But Saxman said that because the
vote was taken after relatively little
discussion, the topic would definitely
be raised again at next week’s
meeting. ‘‘It was probably too much
of a cut and dry vote. We didn’t have

4 too much of a discussion on either

side,’ Saxman said.

Tuesday’s vote occurred one week
after Saxman told a Phi reporter and
editor to leave at the beginning of an
IFC meeting. The action was chal-
lenged, but the reporter and editor
left peacefully.

man, to limit the chance of a party’s

added Saxman.

In other IFC business:

The Thanksgiving canned food

drive has been moved to the

Christmas season, said Saxman. He
felt that more time was needed to ef-
fectively plan such a time-consuming
activity, for it to be a success. Cann-
ed foods will be collected during the
drive and distributed to needy
families in the area.

Until this time, Phi reporters had
been attending the meetings regular-
ly for more than a year.

Three hours after the meeting,
Saxman told Phi co-editor Jason Lisi
that he and the reporter had been
kicked out because nothing in the IFC
constitution states that the meetings
had to be open to the press and
public. He also said that they were
asked to leave because of negative
news about fraternities constantly
being printed in the paper, said Lisi.

Lisi said that at the end of their
conversation, Saxman told him that
the reporter would be allowed to at-
tend the meetings. But when the
reporter arrived at this week’s
meeting, Saxman told her that she
would not be allowed to enter. With
her out of the room, the IFC voted
against admitting reporters.

The fraternity that voted for the
admission of a reporter said that it
could be a benificial action for the
IFC. Sigma Nu President David
Barnes said, ‘‘I think that the Ring-
tum Phi would make the IFC much
more responsible if they were there.”

Saxman said that he views a
reporter at the IFC meetings as an

unnecessary action, because he
thinks that many of the items
discussed at IFC meetings are not
newsworthy, Saxman agreed to
speak with a reporter after every
meeting to release the information
discussed at the meeting.

After the meeting, Saxman spoke
with the reporter and stressed that
the topic was not closed. When asked
why they decided to hold the vote, he
said there were a lot of negative com-
ments concerning last week’s inci-
dent. He felt that the IFC was
generally not receptive to a
reporter’s being present at the
meeting, so he decided to a hold a
vote.

Saxman said in a phone conversa-
tion last night that he felt that this
was a minor topic that is not resolv-
ed. When told that the Phi would be
running this story, he expressed con-
cern that the issue would become
blown out of proportion. He said that
he would no longer attempt to deal
with the Phi concerning this topic,
and expressed dissatisfaction with
the fact that the Phi found this stery
so important.

EC rejects new
HV trial proposal

By VALERIE PIERSON
Staff Reporter

 

In its meeting Monday night, the
Executive Committee considered a
proposal by James Humphreys, the
third year law representative. The
proposal called for the formation of
an ad hoc committee which would
evaluate two specific areas of the
Honor System.

The first issue to be discussed was
that of discovery, which is the means
by which an accused person learns
what the witnesses against him are
going to say. Humphreys stated that
the present system allows for a trial
by surprise because many times the
accused has no idea of what certain
witnesses are voing to say; there-
fore, he is unable to prepare an ade-
quate defense for his case.

The second issue was whether the
closed hearings of the Executive
Committee should be more adver-
sarial in nature. Humphreys said
that he was concerned because pro-
secution evidence is commonly
presented in a confused manner due
to the format of the closed hearings.
He argued that an organized prosecu-
tion could better present the facts
surrounding a potential honor viola-
tion.

Humphreys explained that his
main concern was to provide an ac-
curate hearing. He therefore propos-
ed that an ad hoc committee compos-
ed of a law student, two under-
graduates, a law school EC member,
and two undergraduate EC members
be formed to examine his concerns.

The proposal immediately met
with strong opposition. Sophomore
representative Christopher de
Movellan argued that an ad hoc com-
mittee was unnecessary because the
Executive Committee members
themselves were the most familiar
with the inner workings of the Honor
System. Therefore, he suggested that
the EC settle the matter itself.

Executive Committee President
Shayam Menon challenged the idea
that the accused has no means of
discovery. He stated that he is able to
give the accused a brief synopsis of
what a specific witness is going to
say.

Furthermore, he added in an inter-
view that every benefit is given to the
accused, and extensions are granted
if legitimate reasons are given, suck
as the need to obtain documents frorr
various sources.

Students work off-campus

 

By CHRISTIE CHAMPLIN
Staff Reporter

 

Although students are kept more than busy by the
academic and social activities at Washington and Lee
University, many find time for part-time jobs in the Lex-
ington community. Alvin-Dennis, The Palms, The Col-
lege Town Shop, and Spanky’s are just some of the local
stores which employ students.

The majority of the employees of Alvin-Dennis are
members of a fraternity since they ‘draw people from
their houses into the store,”’ said owner Alvin Carter. The
employees work part-time and do not go through a set
training program. Many of the students who start work
continue to do so through graduation, while some even
continue to work after graduating, before continuing
school or changing to another profession.

Steve Morris, a senior, has been working at Alvin-
Dennis since May, 1984. Morris works three days a week
because it gives him many good opportunities to meet
people. His earnings are used for pocket money and are
applied toward bills. His responsibilities include sales
and inventory at the store. The hours are ‘‘very flexible,”’
Morris said, adding that one can work ‘‘whenever you
want to,”

He does not think that his job is interfering with his
academic or social life. The wages consist of a varying
commission and a credit toward a personal bill.

Other W&L student employees at Alvin-Dennis are
Wright Ledbetter, a sophomore; Reese Lanier, a junior;
Tem Myers, a sophomore; David Dunn, a junior;
Christopher de Movellan, a sophomore; Johnny Alford,
2nd year law; Powell Starks, a junior in the law school.

In order to work at the Palms students must be at least
18 years old; however, it is preferable to owner Wade
Leslie if all of his employees are 21 so they can work
behind the bar. The age requirement cuts down on the
number of students working at the restaurant. The lack

of flexibility in student’s schedules also hinders their
working.

“Students aren’t as flexible as we'd like them to be,”’
said Leslie. There is a need for help on the big weekends
such as Homecoming Weekend and ‘‘students have their
social lives, too,’’ said Leslie. The necessary training is
usually completed within a week.

Students sometimes continue working through gradua-
tion. For example, last year an employee who had work-
ed in the kitchen for two years graduated. Due to the age
requirements students usually do not begin working until
their junior or senior years.

The students work predominately evening shifts. W&L
students working this year are Greg Barrow, a junior;
Mark Chiapparra, a junior; Will Graham, a sophomore;
and Bobby Fitts, a senior who is working for his second
year.

Mike Henry and Quinn Barton, juniors, work at The
College Town Shop. Henry is working to ‘make a little
extra spending money,’ while Barton is working to gain
“good experience.” They work two or three times a week
for about ten hours. Their earnings, a set wage and a
commission, are used to pay for their bills, recreational
activities and the necessities of life. Their responsibilities
are to sell clothes and watch over the store when the
manager is not there. The hours are arranged depending
on the employees’ schedules, The part time job does not
interfere with academics because ‘‘you learn to budget
your time’’ and ‘‘make a routine,” said Barton.

Friends who come into the store offer a ‘‘good change
of pace,’’ provide a chance to socialize while working and
can usually be persuaded to buy something.

Spanky’s hires students on the basis of their availabili-
ty. They must hold to their commitment of at least two

OPINION

The Ring-tum Phi, October 23, 1986

 

Half-ring circus

There was a proposal brought before the EC at last Mon-
day’s meeting that asked to form a committee that would ex-
amine two issues, namely discovery of evidence for the stu-
dent accused of an honor violation and the possiblility of hav-
ing the EC play the role of a prosecutor during an honor trial.

Through discovery, an accused student finds out what
evidence each witness will be presenting against him. An ac-
cused student needs to know this information in order to pro-
perly prepare his defense. It also allows the student to obtain
documents that may be helpful in his defense.

Under the present system, information about and honor of-
fense is often brought out in an unorganized manner during a
trial, according to third year law representative, Jimmy
Humphreys. EC members are free to ask questions, and the
information comes out in bits and pieces. If an EC member
would act as a prosecutor, he could draw out information in a
certain order.

However, the real issue is not whether the EC will adopt
these ideas. The EC voted down the idea of forming the com-
mittee. This seems, in the words of EC representative Louise
Phipps-Senft, “‘very narrow-minded.”’ The EC didn’t seem to
give the proposal a chance. It certainly couldn’t hurt
anything to have a committee just examine the ideas.

Some EC members seemed to make up their mind in the
first few minutes, and desregard any discussion after that
point. There was a complete disregard for parlimentary pro-
cedure (Robert’s Rules of Disorder). Some EC members
were passing notes during the discussion, and at one point
there was a dispute between Humphreys and Andrew
Caruthers over who had been at more honor trials (’’My dad-
dy’s bigger than your’s! Is not!’’).

Particularly disturbing was Caruther’s decision to abstain
from voting on the proposal, after he opposed it so strongly.
He also abstained on the vote to have several EC members
examine the proposal’s ideas and make a presentation at a
special EC meeting. His comment: “‘I can’t vote against hav-
ing additional EC meetings, but I won’t vote for it.’’

The EC needs to remember how important its job is, and
start treating their meetings accordingly. Not every topic the
EC deals with is of earth-shattering importance (the ODK
walkway) and levity has its place, but not during discussions
that may result in revisions of the White Book.

Right to know Are we too removed from the real world?

At last Tuesday’s Interfraternity Council meeting, a mo-
tion was passed barring Ring-tum Phi reporters from atten-
ding future council meetings. Eleven fraternities supported
the motion while five abstained; only one opposed it.

The decision came one week after a Phi reporter and editor
were removed from a meeting. After that meeting, a verbal
agreement was reached between IFC President Chris Sax-
man and the editor, which was to allow a Phi reporter to be
present at the next meeting.

At this week’s meeting, Saxman stopped the reporter and
told her that the members were going to vote on whether or
not she could attend the meeting. She was subsequently bar-
red from it.

The Phi realizes the IFC is a private organization, and as
such, is not required to have newspaper reporters cover its
proceedings. However, the IFC represents over 60 percent of
the student body, and even a portion of non-Greek participate
in the social aspects of fraternities. It seems that a council af-
fecting such a sizable amount of students, would understand
the newsworthiness of the business they conduct.

One of the reasons cited for the reporting ban is ‘‘bad
press.”’ First of all, the Ring-tum Phi does not make the
news; it merely reports it. When a fraternity or a brother
gets into trouble with the police, it cannot be brushed aside
for fear of creating a bad name for those involved. The IF'‘C
should be concerned with those responsible for creating the
“‘bad press”’ and not with the reporters covering its meeting.

Secondly, if the Ring-tum Phi is kept from attending
meetings, how can the paper report anything the IFC feels is
important and constructive? The actual meeting should be
one of the primary sources of news for the paper concerning
fraternity business. Banning reporters forces them to rely on
outside sources that may ignore the constructive activities of
fraternities.

Saxman claims the Phi can get everything that happened
in the meetings from him after they are over. What this
amounts to is Saxman controlling what the student body
hears concerning fraternities.

Factual errors happen in every newspaper. They are un-
fortunate but they occur. For those errors that have ap-
peared in the paper, the Phi apologizes.

Hopefully an agreement can be worked out between the
IFC and the Ring-tum Phi. The Phi is not asking to be includ-
ed in every aspect of the IFC meetings; it is only asking that
reporters be allowed to attend some portions of the meetings
in order to assure fair and accurate coverage of an extremely
important aspect of W&L life.

MY VIEW

By Susan Lewis

 

College students quite often joking-
ly refer to life after graduation as
“the real world,” implying that col-
lege life is a world set apart from a
nine-to-five steady job. And surely
college life is different, but when it
comes right down to the basic ideas
of personal integrity and a sense of
right and wrong, how different can —
or at least should — college life be
from the “real world’’?

Unfortunately it seems that some
people view college as a cover from
both the responsibilities and the laws
of the outside world. With this view
they feel that they should be able to
get away with actions in college that
they would be severely punished for

 

in any other circumstance.

This problem can be clearly seen in
the attitude some students at W&L
have towards drugs. It seems that a
few people believe that the use of
drugs by students should not be

by the Student Conduct
Committee. Instead the use of drugs
is something that should be a stu-
dent’s own business if it is done on a
student’s own time.

Granted, drug use may be a per-
sonal issue or problem up to a certain
point, but when it reaches a level
where someone else gets hurt by it.
or the person gets caught, one has to
face up to the consequence of his ac-
tion. In a situation where the Univer-
sity itself might have to deal with the
problem first before the authorities
are notified, the University cannot let
the problem slide by without action
and still retain its image of honor and
dignity.

Of course college is a unique ex-

perience, and in many ways it cannot
at all be compared to everyday life.
Students are exposed to some situa-
tions only in college and at the same
time totally isolated from ex
periences other people must deal
with daily

But certainly a line must be drawn
somewhere as to where “real life’
stops and the sometimes idealized
college life picks up. It is true that
college life does need to be set
somewhat apart from the nine-to-five
work force so that a student may con-
centrate on studying and learning.

But as in all things, extremes can
be harmful. It seems only logical that
the farther apart the two worlds sit,
the harder it is going to be for
students to adjust upon graduation.
After hearing some of the horror
stories some people like to tell about
how difficult it is both to adjust and
find a job after leaving the realative
safety of W&L, I know that I don’t

 

want to have to deal with any more
problems than I have to.

So the question is one of whether or
not a person should be able to get
away with something (ie. drug
usage) at college that they wouldn’t
be able to get away with elsewhere.
There are a few options. One, the
University could tend to “turn the
other cheek” and pretend not to see
the problem. Second, the University
itself could take action agains he of-
fender. Third, the problem could
simply be turned over to the proper
= authorities for them to deal
with.

A university needs to be a place in
which we learn to the best of our
abilities, but at the same time, a
place from which we leave able to
survive and get along with the “real
world.”’ Thus, while enjoying college,
we need to try not to distance our-
selves too far from the world we’ll be
facing in all too short a time.

Outing club offers more than camping equipment

To the Editors:

Have you reached the point in your academic
career where all you can think about is getting
away from campus? And although you would
like to get far away and forget your academic
pressures, you don’t have the time or the money.
Well then, maybe it’s time to think about joining
the OUTING CLUB.

For many years the outing club was a student
run organization that took fellow academians out
to the ‘‘wilderness.’’ In recent years, due to lack
of student interest, the club has turned into a
check out counter for camping equipment.
Although the equipment available is of outstand-
ing quality, the club was intended for more ac-
tive pursuits; it was intended to help generate
student interest in the surrounding natural
areas.

This year an attempt has been made to regen-
erate interest in the club and the great outdoors.
Under the leadership of Rob Lutz and Jenny
Newmark the club is trying to establish a
membership. Last week a small expedition, con-
sisting of Rob, Jenny, Prof. Pemberton, Delia
Ford, Jesse Butfacie and the club mascot, and
myself, hiked up Big House Mountain. Braving
all sorts of terrors of the ‘‘wilderness”’ such as: a
very steep climb without escalators, icky spider
webs in our faces, large unseen animals follow-
ing us, natives shooting off guns, and a thick
mist that penetrated clothing and shut out the
sun, we stoically pushed on to the top. We reach-
ed the top after two hours. This feat would have
proved impossible, without the steady watch-
fulness of Jesse and the wisdom of Prof. Pember-
ton’s guidance. Pemberton, who on reaching the
summit of the goal, pointed out that looking into
the fog gave a visual clue to Nirvana, an in-
teresting analogy, indeed. The whole trip took all
of four hours out of a Sunday afternoon, and
although the group was small everyone had a
good time walking and talking in the woods.

If you are tired of staying around school or just
like the outdoors, check out the Outing Club.
There are no membership fees, transportation is
usually provided, and it will not take a lot of im-
portant time away from your usual weekend ac-

tivities, what ever they may be. Look for notices
on Outing Club activities on the student activities
boards, there’s one right outside the Co-op.

Alumni grateful to APO
To the Editors:

On behalf of the Alumni Office I would like to
extend my thanks to Steve Pockrass and Alpha
Phi Omega for all your help in making Home-
coming Weekend so successful. I cannot say
enough about how important the APO drivers
were to the University’s efforts. While it may
seem like an insignificant detail to most people,
the transportation of our older alumni to and
from the weekend activities was critical in mak-
ing Homecoming so successful for everyone. I
know that the Five-Star Generals and their wives
appreciated it.

Alpha Phi Omega provided a much needed ser-
vice for the University, and we are grateful to
its members. Thanks to Steve Pockrass for his
efforts on behalf of Washington and Lee.

James D. Farrar, Jr.
Assistant Alumni Secretary

Professor upset by trash
To the editors:

Why doesn’t the Student Government get the
Students to pick up the litter; or buy a large
playpen?

Milton Colvin
Professor of Politics

Pyle distrusts Soviets

To the editors:

As alumnus and as merchant, I have hesitated
to respond to even the more egregious follies of

the new W&L. But young Smith’s last two “My
View”’ columns require that some voice of the
Old (Real) W&L be raised in protest.

It might have been excusable, even in a senior
and an ROTC cadet, for Mr. Smith so wildly to
mistake the Administration's position in Reyk-
javik. But coming atop his ‘Bambi-in-the
Orient” plea for US-USSR touchy-feely contact,
his attack on Regan-tactics was too much for this
Byrd Democrat to stomach.

One would rather think that any student of
politics would be aware that the Soviet misgov-
ernment’s diplomatic history consists solely of
seven decades of dishonor. Only twice have they
abided by the terms of any treaty into which they
entered: Brept-hitorsk, 1917, and the Ribben-
trop-Mototor Pact which allowed the rape of
Poland. Apparently, Smith is not cognizant of
how little ‘‘Soviet good faith” means. I say, ap-
parently: for only on this supposition is Smith’s
criticism fo the President’s negotiation strategy
explicable.

Well, there is one other explanation. Last time
‘round, Smith recounted his boozy attempt at
detente with a couple of KGB goons — yes, KGB:
janitors don’t go abroad to study, nor are they
safe to make such contracts with citizens of
Glavniy Vrag, the Great Enemy, the USA. His
actions are consonant with the theory that the
man’s an idiot, truly an ‘innocent abroad.” But
it could also point to knavery. Of the two, I am
more inclined to suppose that young Smith falls
in the class of those Lenin labeled ‘‘useful fools.’’
In either case, this thought that men of your col-
umnist’s caliber are being churned out by my
alma mater, and, words, that such are being of-
fered communications in the US Armed Ser-
vices, is horrifying. If Smith and those like him
refuse to learn the lessons of political history, my
advice to the rest of you is ample: LEARN RUS-
SIAN. You’ll need it.

Sincerely,
Markham §. Pyle, ’84
Lexington, Virginia

Does Washington and Lee really
benefit from having a student-run,
or perhaps miss-run, campus?

Three years ago, our seemingly
megalomaniacal Executive Com-
mittee president considered ap-
pearing on national television to
argue that W&L students should
have been required to wear ties to
class. Also that year, this same
EC president was found guilty of
“tampering with the jury’’ before
an open honor trial.

Last year, the Calyx, our year-
and-a-halfbook, arrived six
months late. The Ariel, our
literary magazine, included
photos cut out of a university
library book.

On Saturday night, just one
week after a daylong symposium
on issues facing fraternities at
W&L, a freshman with a .29 blood-
alcohol level was struck by two
cars on Washington Street.
Earlier that evening, he pledged a
fraternity whose members in-
clude the president of the student
body, the president of the Inter-
fraternity Council, a handful of
dorm counselors and other stu-
dent leaders. No one was responsi-
ble enough to get that student
back to his dorm room safely.

The Phi has had problems, too.
A few weeks ago, senior John
Cummings lambasted this paper
for violating simple conflict-of-
interest rules. As he pointed out,
many of Reid Hall’s better jour-
nalism students have been scared
away by poor personnel manage-
ment at the Phi the past few
years. This year’s editors have
done the best job they could, given
their limited experience.

Recently, some changes have
occurred at the Phi. I hope these
will result in a more exciting
paper that focuses on student opi-
nion and the effect of national
issues on campus, and includes
probing investigations about
topics of importance to W&L.

You can assist in this effort by
volunteering to write about sub-
jects that interest you. You can
help the Phi find more news by
calling 463-8581 to report story
ideas and breaking news.

You can make this a better
paper.

More student responsibility is
needed if we are to make this a
better school. But this is not
enough. We need a more active
faculty adviser system. If the EC,
which should really be named the
ELJC (Executive, Legislative and
Judicial Committee), were to take
a student survey, I bet the results
would show that most of us think
that students have too much
power on this campus, too much
responsibility. As the above ex-
amples show, we have not been
responsible enough to warrant
maintaining such a high level of
student power.

What often seems to separate
the strong and weak organizations
on this campus is the quality of the
edvisers. Students come and go,
but advisers provide experience
ard continuity.

Some of you may argue that ad-
visers are not better than student
leaders simply because they are
older. After all, who would want
“Tricky Dick” Nixon as an ad-
viser? You may contend that the
only way for us to learn is from
our own mistakes.

How many thousands of student
tax dollars must we continue to
waste to learn that these
arguments do not hold water?
How long can we continue under a
system lacking in checks and
balances? Haven’t all the
mistakes we’ve made taught us
that our current system is not the
best?

Or will we need a publicized
abuse of the honor system, a libel
suit, a liability suit, or a year
without a campus publication to
teach us a costly lesson?

NEWS BRIEFS

Symposium discusses role of Greeks

 

Staff Reports

 

The maintenance of a strong fraternity system at
Washington and Lee and the role the system plays at
the university were among the topics discussed at a re-
cent symposium on fraternities at W&L.

The symposium, sponsored by the Alumni Fraternity
Council, brought together representatives of the 17
fraternities on the campus, faculty advisers, members
of the administration, and representatives from the na-
tional headquarters of several national fraternities.

The purpose of the symposium, according to Paul
J.B. Murphy, president of the Alumni Fraternity Coun-
cil, ‘‘is to give broad visibility to the alumni’s interest in
the renassiance of the fraternity system and the main-
tenance of that system in such a manner as to best sup-
port university and fraternity goals.”

Among the topics discussed during the symposium
were the impact of fraternities on a student’s quality of
life at W&L, university regulations, the goals and ex-
pectations of individual students upon joining a frater-
nity, liability, insurance, legal and alcohol issues facing
fraternities, and the rehabilitation and maintenance of
fraternity houses.

The Alumni Fraternity Council may issue a “white
paper’’ containing findings and recommendations on
how best to ensure the survival of a vibrant and con-
structive fraternity system at Washington and Lee.

Former KGB official to speak

Stanislav Levchenko, the highest-ranking KGB of-
ficer ever to defect to the United States, will speak in
Lee Chapel on Thursday, Oct. 30, at 7:30 p.m.

Levchenko’s appearance is being sponsored by Con-
tact, a joint project of the W&L Interfraternity Council
and the Executive Committee of the student body. The
lecture is free and open to the public.

A native of Moscow, Levchenko went to work in 1965
for Soviet organizations affiliated directly with the in-
ternational department of the central committee of the
Soviet Communist Party.

The KGB Foreign Intelligence Service recruited him
as a staff operations officcr. He was stationed in Japan
from 1975 to 1979 under the cover of bureau chief of the
Soviet international affairs weekly magazine ‘New
Times.” In that capacity he was involved in gathering
political information and implementing large-scale
Soviet convert actions in Japan and other countries in
the Far East.

In 1979 he was promoted to the rank of major in the
KGB and was appointed chief of the convert action
group of the KGB’s Tokyo residency. In October of that
year he sought political asylum in the United States.

Author to visit campus

Robert Pinsky, award-winning poet, critic and
author, will visit Washington and Lee October 29-31 to
give a series of lectures and a reading from his works.

His first lecture, “American Poetry and American
Life,”’ will be Wednesday, October 29, at 4:30 p.m.
“Freneau, Whitman, Williams” will be the topic of his
second lecture, to be given Thursday, October 30, at
4:30 p.m. That evening, Pinsky will lecture on ‘Some

Passages of Isaiah’”’ at 8:30 p.m. All lectures will be in
Room 327 of the Commerce School.

Pinsky will give a reading from his works Friday,
October 31, at 4:15 p.m. in the Northen Auditorium of
the University Library. The lectures and the reading
are open to the public.

“History of My Heart’’ (The Ecco Press, 1984), Pin-
sky’s most recent book of poems, was awarded the
William Carlos Williams Prize of the Poetry Society of
America. His earlier works include ‘Sadness and Hap-
piness” (Princeton, 1975) and “An Explanation of
piness” (Princeton, 1980) and ‘The Situation of
Poetry,” a book of criticism.

Pinksy is also co-translator of ‘The Separate
Notebooks,” poems by Nobel Prize winner Czeslaw
Milosz. His poems, essays and translations have ap-
peared in publications ranging from ‘‘The New Yorker”
and ‘“‘The New York Times Book Review’ to “Critical
Inquiry” and “Ironwood”. His works have also ap-
peared in many anthologies including ‘‘The Norton An-
thology of American Literature’ and ‘The Harvard
Book of Contemporary Poetry.”’

Pinsky holds a B.A. degree from Rutgers University
and M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Stanford University.
He has taught at Wellesley, Harvard and the University
of Chicago. Until recently, Pinsky served as poetry
editor of ‘‘The New Republic.’’ He now teaches creative
writing at the University of California, Berkeley.

Pinsky’s visit is sponsored by the Glasgow Endow-
ment, a bequest made in 1960 by Arthur Graham Glas-
gow “to promote the art of expression by pen and

tongue.

Hoosier paintings to be displayed

An exhibit of 41 prints created by Indiana University
graduate students over the last 13 years will be on
display in Washington and Lee University’s duPont
Gallery from October 27 to November 19.

The traveling exhibition is comprised of lithographs,
intaglios, screenprints, woodcuts, computer prints,
silver prints and other media. The diversity of the
works serves to emphasize the experimental atmos-
phere encouraged by faculty members at Indiana Uni-
versity.

DuPont Gallery hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday
through Friday, 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday, and 2 to 4
p.m. Sunday. The exhibit is free and open to the public.

Project |.D. protects property

The Washington and Lee Security Department is con-
tinuing a program it hopes will discourage thieves on
and off campus.

Project I.D. is a program which valuables are per-
manently marked with an engraving tool with the
owner’s Virginia Driver’s License or Social Security
number. The identification numbers help police when
stolen goods are recovered. They provide a reference
for locating the rightful owner.

William C. Datz, assistant proctor at W&L, said any
number of items from bicycles, cameras, and stereos to
sewing machines, typewriters, and sporting goods can
be engraved.

Project I.D. continues through November 21. It is
open to all members of the University community.

 

 

 

Student
struck

by cars

By PETER BOATNER
Staff Reporter

 

Freshman Mike Nunan was struck
by a car crossing Jefferson at
Washington Street on his way home
from a fraternity that he had pledged
earlier that evening.

Nunan said he was running to keep
warm and tried to make a yellow
light at the corner, but did not beat
the oncoming traffic.

He struck one car, rolled off of it,
and was struck by another that had
just started to move.

Nunan received several cuts to the
head and “a pretty banged up”
knee, he said, but tests showed no
serious damage.

Slow reactions by Nunan following
the accident had doctors at Stonewall
Jackson Hospital worried, and he
was transferred for tests to the
trauma unit of a Roanoke hospital,
which released him midday Monday.

No charges have been filed against
either Nunan or the drivers of the
cars involved, according to police
records. 5

 

Lisi resigns as Phi
co-editor due to grades

Lisi said his grades were suffer-
ing too much from his duties on
the newspaper and if he were to
continue, his plans to attend law
school could be jeopardized. “I
cannot fail out of college and still
edit the paper,”’ his resignation
letter said.

The Ring-tum Phi is
Washington and Lee’s only
student-run newspaper. The
paper’s circulation is 3,000 and
about 400 copies are sent to
parents and other outside
subscribers in the United States.
Funding for the paper comes
primarily from advertising and
from a portion of the student ac-
tivities fee.

Squids deep six the Generals

Hampden-Sydney spoils Homecoming

 

by JIM LAKE
Staff Reporter

 

Generals head coach Gary Fallon
was assured of his first losing season
in seven years Saturday, as
Hampden-Sydney rolled to a 45-14
victory over Washington and Lee.
The Tigers spoiled W&L’s homecom-
ing by outgaining the Generals in
total yardage by a 3-to-1 margin, and
Fallon said after the game that
Hampden-Sydney was “the best
team we’ve played, both offensively
and defensively.”’

The Tigers led 7-0 after only three
minutes of play on a touchdown pass
by quarterback Robby Waldrop to
tight end Dan Newell. Later in the
period, Jimmy Hondroulis added a
24-yard field goal, his ninth suc-

cessful kick in as many attempts this
season. Hampden-Sydney exploded
with three touchdowns in the second
quarter, the first coming on a 4-yard
run by Waldrop. Less than two
minutes later, Waldrop hit tailback
David Kelley from three yards out
for a 24-0 lead. But the Tigers weren’t
through yet, as fullback Willie Fobbs
scored on a 1-yard dive play with 2:35
remaining in the half, giving the
Tigers a 31-0 lead at the intermission.

Through the first two periods, the
Tigers crushed the Generals in every
statistical category, including first
downs (16-4), rushing yards (263-47),
and passing yards (93-7). Hampden-
Sydney outgained the Generals in
total offensive yardage by a seven-to-
one margin. The Generals led in only
one category: they out-punted the
Tigers, 3-0. Fallon later called the

first two periods ‘‘as poor a first half
as we’ve ever played.”’

But things didn’t get any better for
the Generals in the second half. With
Kevin Weaver out because of a possi-
ble ankle injury, the Generals offense
soon completed the collapse it had
begun in the first two periods. Quar-
terback Jon Thornton completed only
1 of 8 passes in the first half, and he
completed only three more in the sec-
ond before Fallon pulled his starters.
For the day, Thornton threw as many
as interceptions as completions.
Three of his passes were picked off
by defensive corner Jack Barber,
and two of those interceptions were
made in the end zone. The fourth in-
terception was returned 58 yards by
defensive back Tommy Graziano for
the only scoring in the third period.

Polo swats Spiders

Team to ready itself for championships

 

By MATHEW HORRIDGE
Staff Reporter

 

The Generals finally have snared
the elusive Spiders — the Spiders of
the University of Richmond’s water
polo team.

Washington and Lee downed the
Spiders, 6-4, in Twombly Pool on Sun-
day for the first time in two years.

“We got the monkey off our back,”
said head coach Page Remillard.

The Generals matched up against
the Spiders Sunday afternoon in the
final game of the second round of the
Southern League Championships.

“TI knew we could beat Richmond if
we played up to our potential,” said
Remillard. ‘‘We were healthy and
prepared.”’

The Generals came out of the
locker room ready to face their ar-
chrivals and stormed out to a 2-0 lead
in the first quarter.

The first half ended with the
Generals holding on to a one-goal ad-
vantage at 3-2.

In the third quarter, W&L
established a two-goal lead over the
Spiders which they never relinquish-
ed.

Ch

“That was the biggest win I’ve had
in three seasons,’’ said co-captain
Simon Perez, who threw in two goals
against the Spiders.

Sophomore David Reavy scored
three goals and senior Kevin Lederer
tossed in one goal in the Generals’
winning effort against Richmond.

“That was one of the better team
games I've seen played in my eight
years at W&L,”’ said Remillard.

Remillard said if he had to pick a
most valuable player, it would be his
shallow-end goalies, both the one who
played the Richmond game and the
one who did not.

Sophomore Tom Rawls stopped
nine Richmond shots and allowed but
one goal in the shallow end. The
Generals use a different goalie when
they are defending the net in the deep
end of the pool.

Senior Jeff Cohen, who didn’t play
against Richmond, also received
praise from Remillard.

“Both those guys had intense prac-
tice sessions last week and pushed
each other,’’ Remillard said. ‘Rawls
may have gotten the glory but Cohen
deserves a lot of credit, too.”

“He [Rawls] was fantastic,’’ Perez
said. “That got everyone inspired.”

The Generals beat Mary Washing-
ton 23-0, George Washington 9-1 and
the University of North Carolina-
Wilmington 11-10, on Saturday,
Before the afternoon showdown with
Richmond, W&L beat Lynchburg
College, 18-4, Sunday morning.

Remillard said the UNC-Wilming-
ton game was not as close as the
score indicated because the team lost
much of its intensity after the first
string players were pulled in the first
quarter.

The Generals have this weekend
off to prepare for you know who
— Richmond.

W&L will face the Spiders Satur-
day, Nov. 1 at 7:30 p.m. at the
University of Richmond in the final
round of the Southern League Cham-
pionships.

Richmond defeated the Generals in
the first round of the tournament two
weeks ago.

Richmond is going in to the final
round as the first seed and W&L is
the second seed.

“We must keep up our intensity
and high level of play in order to win
again,” said Remillard.

Cross country jogs past Division | VCU

 

By ANN STEWART
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee men’s
cross country team brought its
record for the 1986 season to 5-2 on
saturday.

They won over the Division I
Virginia Commonwealth team 25-32
in Richmond.

Senior Ted Myers led the men’s
team to victory with a time of 26.29
for the five-mile course.

The Generals also had the third
through fifth place finishers. Junior
Scott Rippeon placed third with a
time of 26:46, senior Ash Andrews
ran fourth at 27:02, and junior
Richard Moore finished fifth at 27:15.

A mere 35 seconds separated the
General’s top four runners. ‘We are
winning with our top three or four
men, whose times are very close,”’
said head coach Dick Miller.

Meanwhile, the women’s team lost
to VCU by a score of 15-45, dropping

its record to 0-2.

Sophmore Stephanie Smith, the top
finisher for W&L, placed seventh on
the 3.1 mile course with a time of
23:32. Coach Jim Phemister says of
the womens team,” The team is
working hard and getting a lot out of
its workouts and the race experience.
I am proud of the way we are pro-
gressing.”’

Both teams will travel to Bridge-
water for a tri-meet including West
Virginia Tech this weekend.

back Chris Smythe scored four
minutes later from one yard out, pro-
viding the final murmur of protest
from the Generals ina 45-14 rout.
: Evaluating the game as a whole,
s Fallon was extremely disappointed
; with his team. ‘You can’t play that
kind of football against a good foot-
pall team,” said Fallon. “What was
/ really concerning to me was the fact
that we weren’t playing aggressive
football. That bothers me more than
anything,’ he said.

Consequently, Fallon says that
changes in personnel for this week’s
game against the University of the
South at Sewannee are not unlikely.
If, in reviewing film of the Hampden-
. Sydney game, ‘we feel that some
* — people aren’t performing up to their

 

capabilities, we’re going to make
some changes. My job is to find some
football players who really want to
win,”

Looking at Sewanee, Fallon is con-
cerned that the Generals will take ‘‘a
wait-and-see” attitude, in which case
W&L “will be in for another long
afternoon.”’ Sewanee “‘is a scrappy
outfit,”’ he said. “‘They throw the ball
all over the place.”’ The Tigers have
two quarterbacks, both of whom
have good mobility as well as good
arms, said Fallon. ‘‘We’re going to
have our hands full. If we don’t get
some intensity, we will be beaten
again.”

Van Son added that he thought the

would not be too badlv affected. “In
the second half of the loss,” he
said,’’we played pretty well.”

Perez supported Remillard’s view

 

() Continued from Page 6

Remillard said W&L traditionally
has done very well against the
Spiders in their home pool.

“We've defeated Richmond more
at their pool than in our pool,” he
said.

“The crowd factor will be a plus for
both sides,’’ Remillard added,
because the team responds to crowd
noise, whether positive or negative.
He said, however, that he would like

of Richmond’s fans: ‘‘The crowds
usually haven’t been that much of a
problem.”

The team will have ‘‘two weeks of
specialty practice,’ Remillard said.

“‘We’re not resting on our laurels,”’
Perez said. ‘Our most important
games are still tocome.”’

The Generals have won the
Southern League title three of the
last five years, but have not won in
two years.

I’m going to try something a little bit different this week.

In general, the only time a person will write a column, send a letter
to the editor, or give his opinion is when something (or somebody)
causes his blood pressure to begin an upward spiral. This time I’m go-
ing to break that pattern.

Today my column is devoted to things in the sports world that I like,
things that I enjoy.

To borrow a line from Julie Andrews: ‘‘These are a few of my
favorite things.’’ To coin a new phrase: ‘‘Bear with me, there might be
a thing or two here that you like.”’

eThere is something about watching live baseball that can’t be beat.
I love going to Veterans Stadium to watch the Philadelphia Phillies.
The best time to go (I think) is in June or July before the pennant races
start to heat up. This way, you avoid all the people who come to the
park just because the Phils are in first place (admittedly not a pro-
blem this year) or because they’re playing a first-place team.

eWhile at the ballpark I always buy at least one of the stadium hot-
dogs, and I always buy it from a vendor as opposed to buying 1t at tne
snack bar. While this may not seem to be a major undertaking to most,
a closer look reveals the almost sublime pleasure that one can receive
from this fairly simple exchange.

The hotdogs themselves are almost always terrible and always
overpriced. In fact, you could buy a pack of 10 franks at the grocery
store for the same price as just one of the stadium hotdogs. Obviously
the joy lies elsewhere.

I think I like the hotdogs so much because of the vendors who sell
them. These people are always the most interesting in the ballpark.
Despite the lousy pay, terrible hours, and rude fans, I get the feeling
that these people love their work. Maybe they enjoy baseball, maybe
their fathers before them were hotdog vendors, maybe they have day
jobs and just sell hotdogs on the side — I dont know. Whatever the
reason I’m sure that they’re enjoying themselves at work, and there
are millions of people who can’t say the same.

eJust one more thing about baseball — I promise. I like the way that
baseball has refused to cheapen the regular season by instituting a
“come one, come all”’ playoff system. I think that the present system
is very fair, especially since the league championship series has been
lengthened to the best four out of seven. This forces teams to show
their fourth starter, maybe go to their third or fourth reliever, play the
23rd and 24th man on their roster. In short, it makes sure that the
whole team is tested, not just the first string.

Despite all the fights, and the meaningless regular season, I like
professional hockey. My favorite team (if anyone is interested) is the
Philadelphia Flyers. Hockey is fast, rough, and exciting—sort of like
lacrosse with skates. Because I have always liked hockey, I started to
watch lacrosse when I came to school. Maybe it works the other way,
too.

That was just a short trip through some of my favorite things in
sports. Maybe there were some things that you liked too; maybe you
hated everything I mentioned. At any rate, thanks for indulging me.

Steve King at home.

 

By MARK FARLEY
Staff Writer

 

It could serve as a perfect word
association test: Horror? Stephen
King. Macabre? Stephen King. Best
seller? Stephen King.

This actually is not too far from the
truth. Stephen King has written more
than 20 books (mostly novels, but
some short stories as well) and has
grossed more than $20 million by sell-
ing 60 million copies of them around
the globe. Not too shabby for some-
one writing specifically in the horror
genre.

Washington and Lee students def-
initely enjoy reading King. Susan A.
LaRue of the W&L bookstore is cer-
tain that among the authors
available on the shelves, King is one
of the most popular and is a steady
seller. In fact, she says that King
“sells like no one else.”’

King was raised, fatherless, ‘in
Durham, Maine. He remembers him-
self as being an angry child who
sought and desired some form of
revenge for his difficult childhood. It
is not surprising, then, that many of
King’s protagonists are odd, feel left
out, and seek revenge as well.

King went on to attend the Univer-
sity of Maine where he majored in
English. After he was graduated, he
worked as a prep-school English
teacher. When he wasn’t working, he
wrote, and wrote. And finally, it paid
off.

King’s steady rise began with the
novel Carrie in the early ’70s. Until
that point, he had been scraping out a

The Ring-tum Phi, October 23, 1986

living by his teaching and by submit-
ting stories to men’s magazines of
questionable quality. After Carrie,
the titles, most of them best sellers,
can be read off straight from the card
catalog: Salems Lot (1975), The Shin-
ing (1977), The Stand (1978), The Dead
Zone (1979), Firestarter (1980), Cujo

(1981), Danse Macabre (1981), Chris-
tine and Pet Sematary (1983).

In fact, King’s publishers began to
fear that since he was writing so
much (about two books a year) he
would exhaust his audience. Rather
than slow down, King submitted five
novels under the name Richard
Bachman. These sold all right on
their own, but when people found out
that Bachman was King, sales took
off. The novel Thinner by
Bachman/King became an almost in-
stant best seller.

In addition to his own novels, King
collaborated with Peter Straub, the
author of Ghost Story, on the novel
The Talisman (1984), which was
greedily consumed by King enthus-
iasts. Collections of King’s short
stories have been published in the
books Night Shift and Skeleton Crew. It
is amazing how tightly written and
horrific these brief tales can be.

But, if you still don’t believe, try
this. On some cold, gray day this Oc-
tober, buy The Shining or Salems Lot
or any other book by the Master of
Horror, and set it on the nightstand
by your bed. That night, turn out all
the lights save one and pick up the
book. Then, with the wind rattling
your windows and with the shadows
of leafless and barren trees dancing
on your walls, let Mr. King talk to you
and show you what fear is all about.

Viexican folk ballet to invade Lex

 

 

\FF REPORTS

 

‘he Rockbridge Concert-Theatre Series’ first offer-
of its forty-first season is the Ballet Gran Folklorico
Mexico, who perform a two-hour extravaganza of

. nging and dancing and have been hailed by ‘‘The New
rk Times”’ as ‘‘One of the most beautifully costumed
ince companies to appear in...recent memory.’’ Ac-
rding to the ‘‘Times,”’ the Ballet Grand Folkorico had
he audience clapping and humming along several
iutes into the program.”

Surely one of the most spectacular offerings in RCTS
‘story, the Ballet Gran Folklorico de Mexico is a pro-
“ram of Mexican folkdances including such northern
‘xican offerings as the polka, chottis, redova and
Itz (introduced to Mexico by Europeans and adapted
native villagers), as well as songs and dances from

» Yucatan where Mayan culture had its beginnings.
\'so performed are the ancient music of the Chiapas
, tribe formed by a mixture of Indian and Spanish
peoples — the eastern dances of the Oaxaca region
10se melodies are played by Marimba bands, and the
‘amiliar fandago and Mexican Hat Dance. And the au-
ence will be thrilled by the world famous Mariachi

nds.

‘he authentic native folk dances and music are per-
‘formed by genuine folk artists as well as professional
susicians, under the direction of Theo Shanab, who led
1e Ballet Gran Folkorico to first prize in folklore in the
‘orld Folklore Festival in 1976. The rhythmic, joyous
isic and dance is enhanced by the stunning native
costumes garnished with feathers, ribbons, and hand-
ewn flowers in a rainbow of vibrant colors.

Washington and Lee students are admitted free by
showing their identification cards at the door. Other
tickets may be purchased prior to the concert at the
‘oor. For more information, call Lee RiCharde at

A big biTe

 

By JIM BENNETT
Book Critic

 

Bill had produced his father’s Walther
again...Richie watched this, fascinated,
and then looked under the porch again.
He saw something else this time.
Broken glass. Faintly glinting shards of
glass. His stomach cramped painfully.
He was not a stupid boy...splinters of
glass on the moldering leaves under the
porch meant that the window had been
broken from inside. From the cellar.

“Wh-What?” Bill asked again, look-
ing up at Richie. His face was grim and
white. Looking at that set face, Richie
mentally threw in the towel.

“Nothing.” he said.

“You cuh-cuh-homing?”

“Yeah.”

They crawled under the porch.

It has been said of Stephen King’s
novels that they are the literary
equivalent of a Big Mac and french
fries. If so, then Stephen King’s new
work, IT, must be a Double Whopper
(over 1,100 pages).

Obviously the originator of this
remark questions the quality of
King’s achievements. However, he
does not appreciate the simple
pleasures in life—like a good ham-
burger or a Stephen King horror
story, for example. The problem in
IT, however, is that King tries to ac-
complish too much and the story
becomes contrived and confusing.

IT, situated in the fictional town of
Derry, Maine, involves a creature

 

into King’s

new Double Whopper

that eunforms to its young victims’
nightmares and fears. It appears
most often as a leering parody of
Bozo the clown/Ronald McDonald.
This, understandably, sounds far-
cical, but King has accurately cap-
tured how subconsciously sinister a
clown can be to young children.

Hunting “It” in the sewers under
this rural 1950s town is the stuttering
Bill Denbrough (who grows up to
write horror novels) and his six
young friends, known as The Losers.
Their strength against ‘‘It’’ is their
childhood innocence and understand-
ing of each other’s problems.

But wait! It’s suddenly 1985 and we
discover that somehow The Losers
defeated “‘It’’ in 1958 and have since
grown up, separated, and have tried
to forget their frightening experi-
ences, ‘‘It,” however, has started yet
another reign of terror and The
Losers must fulfill an old oath to
reunite in order to save themselves
and the children of Derry. Here King
has erred by trying to run two plots at
the same time, and the reader is sore
pressed to keep track of which time
frame each chapter is in. King, also,
does not stay simple with “It”; he
tries to make “‘It’’ into mythological
creature/space  visitor/giant
spider/evil cosmic deity all wrapped
into one. ‘It’ also becomes less
frightening ince we know it was
defeated before in 1958. While these
aspects of IT are disappointing, most
King fans probably won't mind. IT is
the sort of book that horror fans will
want tostay up late with.

Olin wins
in landslide

 

By CHRIS MUNSEY
Staff Reporter

 

Incumbent Democrat Jim Olin won
a smashing victory over Republican
challenger Flo Traywick in Tues-
day’s election, capturing 78 percent
of the popular vote from the people of
Rockbridge County.

Olin’s 78 percent of the vote
represents the highest margin of re-
election he has won from area voters
in the past three Congressional
races. Olin won 58 percent of the vote
recorded in Lexington and Rock-
bridge County in the ’84 election,
against the 42 percent of Republican
Ray L. Garland.

Olin was first elected to the 6th
district in 1982, winning 51 percent of
local voters. Republican Kevin G.
Miller lost by only three percentage
points in the 1982 election.

Four amendments to the state con-
stitution of Virginia were also ap-
proved by state and local voters. The
first amendment allows a person
removed from registration list of
eligible voters to re-register through
the mail. Under present law, a per-
son who doesn’t vote at least once in
four years is automatically removed
from the registration lists and must
show up in person to re-register.

The second amendment approved
allows government employees to

serve as assistant registrars and of-
ficers of election. The current law
prohibits government employees
from these positions.

The third amendment allows the
Virginia Supreme Court to respond
on matters of state law to federal
courts and the appellate courts of
other states. The final amendment
gives the state the right to appeal
court decisions that dismiss a defen-
dant or supress evidence. The state
will only be allowed to appeal before
the jury is sworn in or before the first
witness is heard ina non-jury trial.

Traywick tried to portray Olin as a
liberal out of touch with the philo-
sophy of the 6th district, and promis-
ed to support the goals of the Reagan
administration if she was elected.
Olin consistently dodged the liberal
label and stressed his businesslike
approach in Congress during the
campaign.

Flo Traywick spent eight years in
the Virginia legislature as a
legislative aide to Vance Wilkens, the
Republican delegate who represents
Rockbridge County in Richmond.
Traywick is also a member of the
Republican National Committee.

Jim Olin has lived in the Salem
area since 1968, when he became the
manager of a local General Electric
factory. Olin retired from GE in 1982
and ran for Congress the first time
that year.

The Flood of ’85,
a year later

By TOM BRICKEL
Staff Reporter

 

To most Washington and Lee
students, the flood is but a faint
memory of showerless nights and
threatened power shortages. To
others, that there ever was a flood is
a new and surprising fact.

Flooding began after Parents’
Weekend last year, the result of three
days worth of rain that reached a
crescendo on Monday. The effects of
flooding in the area were felt im-
mediately. The Maury river swelled
to the height of the Maury river
bridge, inundating houses in the flood
plain with water and debris. The
water level in Woods Creek also rose,
covering low-lying footpaths and
moving the small footbridge down-
stream.

Some students were affected by
rising water levels: those living in
Bean’s Bottom and in residences
close to the river had to evacuate
their homes when waters rose sever-
al feet in a matter of hours early
Tuesday morning. But most students
living in dormitories or residences
high above the flood waters were
unaffected by the flood’s damage.
Downed telephone lines did reduce
service for a few days after the flood,
but it was resumed soon after

Students suffered one side effect
from the flood: a request made by
Lexington Mayor and W&L econo-
mics professor Charles F. Phillips,
Jr. to refrain from using water for
purposes other than for cooking,
drinking, and emergency purposes.
Due to the flooding of the Maury
river, the Lexington water treatment
plant had to forego operations until
water could be removed from it.

Students had to forego showers,
laundry and car washing temporari-
ly, an idea some had trouble accept-
ing.

Though damage in Lexington was
limited largely to the water treat-
ment plant and scattered residences,
surrounding areas were not so for-
tunate. Business and residential
losses in Buena Vista, GlasgoW and
Goshen amounted to over $65 million,
Buena Vista alone suffered about $50
million worth of damage, mostly to
local industry.

According to Goshen mayor Anita
Tuttle, damage to the town of 350 was
considerable. ‘‘Because the center of
town is in a low-lying area, many of
the businesses and public buildings
downtown were inundated,’’ says
Tuttle.

And though only 10 families were

The Soviet Union is using the
“largest subversive mechanism in
the history of mankind” to under-
mine United States foreign and
domestic policy, said Stanislav Lev-
chenko to a_ standing-room-only
crowd in Lee Chapel last Thursday
night.

Levchenko, the highest ranking
KGB official ever to defect to the
West, said that the Soviet Union
spends $2 billion a year on “‘disinfor-
mation.’”’ According to Levechenko,
disinformation is the Soviet Union’s
effort to influence foreign decision
making, international public opinion
and foreign legislatures. They at-
tempt this through Soviet propagan-
da, such as pamphlets and speeches
by high-ranking officials, and covert
actions which are considerably more
dangerous, yet not easily traced to
the Soviet government.

Levchenko himself said he was in-
volved in such covert actions as a
KGB agent stationed in Japan under

the guise of Bureau Chief of Soviet In-
ternational Affairs Weekly Magazine
“New Times.’’ Levchenko told the
crowd that he used gloves to handle
forged letters sent to public figures
and journalists in Japan and the Far
East to avoid having the letters trac-
ed through the fingerprints.

The Soviets have become experts
at forgeries, said Levchenko, but
sometimes they become careless, He
asserted that during the 1984 Sum-
mer Olympic Games in Los Angeles,
the KGB sent forged threatening let-
ters from the Ku Klux Klan to some
Third World countries. The letters
were obviously forgeries, said Lev-
chenko, for several reasons. There is
no nationwide organization known
solely as the Ku Klux Klan, the let-
ters contained many grammatical
errors in the English language and
all of the letters were postmarked
from the Maryland suburbs
surrounding Washington D.C.

The KGB can even forge CIA
documents because they have access
to almost every form of stationery
and letterhead that exists, according

File Photo

Agent reveals KGB acts

to Levchenko.

This “‘silent war of disinformation”
is impossible to stop, said Lev-
chenko, but it is possible to slow
down. The American people must
broaden their awareness, said
Levechenko and become less naive
and vulnerable to the KGB’s mani-
pulative covert actions. He also call-
ed for “expelling all perpertrators of
Soviet disinformation from the
United States’’ to help disrupt such
covert actions.

Levchenko defected from the
Soviet Union in October 1979, soon
after his promotion to the rank of Ma-
jor in the KGB and was appointed as
Chief of the Active Measures Group
of the Tokyo Residency of the KGB.
He told the audience that his decision
to defect had taken him almost 20
years to make. Levchenko said he
had several chances to defect before
actually doing so. A dislike for the
“Soviet system” existed for many
years, but he did not want to defect
until deciding to work against the ef-
forts of the Soviet Union and the
KGB.

OPINION

The Ring-tum Phi, November 6, 1986

 

Faustus U.?

In the November 10 issue of Time magazine, the article
‘‘What Is College For?’’ discusses the motives of students at-
tending college today. According to a study done by the
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, most
current high school students and their parents believe the
primary goal of college is to get a well paying job, rather
than to learn.

A sample of the statistics quoted in the article include the
University of Illinois report that “only 19% of its humanities
students have guarenteed jobs upon graduation, vs. 90% for
business majors.” According to U.S. Government statistics
quoted in the article, bachelors degrees in business have
risen from 114,865 in 1971 to 230,031 in 1984, and B.A.s in
English and literature have declined from 57,026 in 1971 to
26,419 in 1984.

It appears that the desire to make money and get ahead
has overpowered the pursuit of higher intellect. Some may
Say the concern for fellow mankind is dead, and that most
‘pre-med or pre-law students are only out for the high income
bracket. Is this a valid assessment?

It is to a degree. Students must be realistic. They know in
what sort of lifestyle or environment they want to live, and
they also realize what sort of career they must obtain to
reach their goal.

The pursuit of a career has its limitations when it serves as
an all consuming vacuum. Many business majors hate their
C-school classes. They complain that because a business ma-
jor is so regimented they cannot fit in the philosophy course
or English lit course that they would like to take. If this is the
case, then yes, the pursuit of an academic major for the sake
of income is bad. However, thé majority of business majors
have some sort of interest in their major beyond the money it
will bring them.

Many concerns with students attending college only for a
career are solved in the system of liberal education. Students
get the technical training for the career they want to pursue,
as well as courses in other disciplines.

Certainly, many schools are becoming more business and
professionally oriented, and this trend is likely to continue
until high paying jobs for English and Philosophy majors
become more readily available. Because so many people are
majoring in business, pre-med, and pre-law, there will un-
doubtably be a shortage of teachers. Because of the increase
in demand, perhaps salaries for teachers will rise and people
will again pursue these majors.

Until then, students should evaluate why they are at W&L
and realize that for some this is the last opportunity they
have to explore interests outside their intended career.

Reprieve

As Parents’ Weekend approaches, students at Washington
and Lee have a tendency to examine their academic stand-
ing. Many have reached the point of being ‘‘out of gas’’;
burnt out also describes the situation. It is possible that
students need a rest.

The upcoming Thanksgiving break, eagerly awaited by
students, is a prime reason for not having an official fall
break. While it is a reason, it is not reasonable.

The break comes too late in the term to allow students a
needed rest from classes. Unlike the winter and spring
terms, there is no break after six weeks of classes. Instead,
the break comes after ten weeks of classes. Everyone knows
that a W&L, four weeks of classes adds up to a large amount
of work.

Thanksgiving ends up being a week of work away from
school. Students write term papers, read assigned books and
basically attempt to catch up before final exams. This large
amount of work takes a lot away from a holiday when one
should be with family and friends.

A break after the sixth week of fall term would benefit
everyone. Coming earlier in the term, it would help avoid stu-
dent burn-out, which only hurts one’s academic standing.
With mid-terms out of the way and exams not yet in sight, the
work load over break would not be as heavy as it is over
Thanksgiving break.

Shortening the Thanksgiving break would be a feasible
solution to working in the time for a fall break except that a
shorter break would make it harder for some students to get
home for the holiday. A better solution would be to start
freshman orientation and classes one week earlier, which
would put the university on a schedule similar to most other
colleges and universities in the country.

A motion was passed Tuesday by the Interfraternity
Council that will allow the Ring-tum Phi to cover portions
of its meetings. The Phi hopes to cover the meetings as

fairly and accurately as possible, and avoid any problems
in the future.

Do you ever wonder why W&L
doesn’t switch Parents’ Weekend
and Homecoming so our folks
could see us halfway between the
start of school and Thanksgiving?

The reason, according to
Associate Development Director
Carter McNeese, is because it is
important to have Parents’ Week-
end after freshman mid-term
grades have been released. Lucky
freshmen, almost makes you not
want to be one.

Freshman mid-terms have a
habit of making parents about as
welcome as in-laws. Or maybe
outlaws. That’s why I think there
is actually a second cause, what I
refer to as “THE NAME-DROP-
BIRD-DROP-POPULARITY
PRINCIPLE.”

Have you every noticed how
popular people suddenly become
during Parents’ Weekend? If you
haven’t, you’re probably a fresh-
man. And although your mid-
terms may belie it, you’re also
smart enough to impress your
parents with your popularity by

 

LEXICON

dropping names faster than birds
drop droppings or droplets.

Of course, you won’t tell your
momma how superficial your re-
lationships are with most of these
people, a complex and time-con-
suming problem. So to help you
out in this and other people-
related predicaments, I’m pro-
ducing the ‘Lexicongrapher’s
Guide To Friendship, Love and
The Like, If You Please.”

Here’s the Parents’ Weekend
section. Simply use the numbers
and or letters to describe your
relationships.

“Mom, Dad, this is (name).
He/she is:

1) A ‘real’ friend, the kind who
would give me mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation even if I stopped
breathing while eating a Lloyds’
burger with onions.

2) An ‘average’ friend (please
use letters for specificity) a) is for
automobile, which he/she posses-
ses; b) is for beer, which he/she is
old enough to purchase for me; c)
is for cash, of which he/she has an

Number 9, number 9, number 9

overabundance.

3) A mooch, and is using me
because I am a 2a, 2b or 2c (see
above).

4) A fraternity brother whose
name and vital statistics I had to
memorize at the risk of hazing
(What? Not here at W&L.)

5) Wearing a nametag.

6) My dorm counselor, and
he/she a) loves me; b) hates me;
c) has no idea who I am.

7) Called on in class every day
by the professor. I always address
him/her as Mr./Ms., because
that’s how the professor does it,
and I don’t know his/her first
name.

8) The one who kissed my hand
and shook my baby while running
for class office.

9) Just a person whose name I
know. (Beatles fans, note the
significance of this being the most
judicious and, therefore, the most
common of answers. )

10) Your Mama? Well how do
you do? I’m very pleased to meet
Vet.

 

 

 

 

Freshman agrees with Jones’ My View

To the Editors:

It is an accepted fact that incoming freshmen
are inherently slow on the uptake and, regret-
ably, I am no exception. Nevertheless, I have
managed to stumble upon what seems to be the
consensus on campus. Nobody, and I mean
nobody, likes the Ring-tum Phi. Doesn’t this
bother you, the people most responsible for the
Phi? It should. In fact, it should bother you so as
to compel you to heed Abb Jones’ advice and
seek a faculty advisor. In order to properly
report information to the public (or, in this case,
the student body) the Fourth Estate must first
earn the confidence of the public. In the case of
the Phi, this confidence simply does not exist.
Admittedly, my high school newspaper wasn’t

 

LETTERS

much, but one problem we did not have was an
avalanche of public disapproval.

Do not mistake me, the Phi is far from a lost
cause. The fact that you ran Abb Jones’ article
proves that the Phi does have the rare ability to
criticize itself. Unfortunately, it also seems to
have the not-so-rare ability to be hypocritical.
Nowhere is this more apparent than in your end-
less feud with the fraternities. Nobody's reputa-
tion or credibility stands to gain in this war of
words. This may come as a bit of a shock, but
fraternities do not represent Nazism, Fascism,
or the Ku Klux Klan. So why don’t you call off the

witch hunt?

As W&L’s only school newspaper, the Phi has a
huge responsibility. Obtaining a faculty advisor

would go a long way toward, at last, fulfilling
that responsibility.

Student questions grammar

To the editors:
I read Christopher B. Saxman’s letter in last
week’s issue. Nice grammar.

MY VIEW

By Chris Carter

 

i

The scene had all the emotion and,
drama of an Academy Award win-
ning movie. I could hear the two well-
wishers as they said goodbye to their
friend John and wished him a safe
journey. A third friend walked by
and, when told where John was go- '
ing, sadly made the Sign of the Cross ,
over him as she said, ‘‘Oh, you foolish
idealist, you!’’ With the final com- *
ment on who was to receive his col- ,
lection of party tapes and (empty)
beer cans, John bid his friends’
farwell. ‘‘If I don’t make it,’’ he said, «
“tell my folks I loved them and I’m ,
overdrawn at the bank again.” No,
John wasn’t boarding the ship to go '
be a missionary to the cannibals in «
darkest South Dakota; he was engag-
ed in a far more risky proposition, he
was boarding the elevator — to go
down into the bowels of the Universi-
ty Library for some studying. It was
surely a sign of great courage that
one so young should make such a
valiant gesture for the sake of Mom,
Apple Pie and the GPA. t

Perhaps you were unaware of it, |
but W&L recently made the ‘‘Guin-
ness Book of World Records”
— though not for anything as mun-
dane as high board scores for enter-
ing freshmen, or job and graduate —
school placement. No, we got a spot ‘
for having the only elevators in cap- «
tivity which break down more often ,
than British sports cars. In my three
and a half years here at W&L, I can’t
remember that both the elevators in |
the Library have ever worked at the
same time for longer than two weeks ‘
— and then usually over Christmas «
Break! There are probably people .
here who have spent as much time ,
waiting on one crowded elevator
moving at a snail’s pace as they have ©
spent actually studying — though it’s «
possible that this says more about
their study habits than the elevators.

You have to wonder sometimes
about the priorities around here. I
mean, we spend over a million dol- *
lars to fix up a house so nice that one +
hesitates to breathe in it for fear of .
disturbing the antique dust for guests
who will be here for only a night or
two, but we can’t (won’t bother to)
find the money to keep machines ‘
which are used by well over a thou- ¢
sand people several times a day in .
working order.

Actually, I’m of the opinion that the
Library, though it’s less than ten *
years old, is haunted. (Yes, I know ;
Halloween is over, but this really
isn’t going to be a ghost story). Con-
sider the heating in there. During the ‘
Spring Term one has two choices:
pneumonia induced by stepping into
the Sub-Zero library temperatures,
or trudging around in 85 degree heat
with a wool sweater under your arn.
in case you have to enter the igloo. In
the winter, on the other hand, it’s a
sauna in there in which boxers and
bikinis are de rigueur. Then there are,
those weird urinals. Ever notice, |
guys, how they sometimes start up ©
without anyone’s flushing them, and
then they won’t cut off? That water
fountain on Lower Level One some-
times does the same kind of thing. As
I say, there must be a ghost that
causes all these crazy things.

But ghost or no ghost, these things
are trivial when compared to those

+ dangerous elevators. A fellow could.
starve while the folks of B and G try
to figure out how to get you out — and
what if you have to go to the bath-
room?? I found out later that John
did make it down to his carrel, but
when you think of all the tension he
went through just to get there, could
anyone really be surprised that he
failed his mid-term the next day? I
think that until the elevators get fix-
ed, all students should get an extra .5
added to our GPA’s just for the stress
we go through. The faculty probably
wouldn’t like doing this, but there is, ,
of course, another solution...

'Mock Convention prepares
for the 1988 meeting

 

By GENIENNE MONGNO
Staff Reporter

 

Just as the 1986 elections end,
students at Washington and Lee are
already gearing up for 1988. It began
last Thursday with the first organiza-
tional meeting of the Mock Demo-
cratic Convention. About 70 to 80 en-
thusiastic newcomers attended hop-
ing to be able to contribute in some
way.

Co-chairman, Lester Coe, said that
he was “‘pleased on a whole”’ with the
turnout. He also noted that although
a lot of people did not show up
because of previous commitments,
he has been approached by many

Professor Emory Kimbrough,
head of the Department of Sociology,
was forced to leave his position at the
University due to illness but is ex-
pected to return winter term.

The nature of the illness was not
disclosed.

John Elrod, dean of the college,
said, ‘Emory Kimbrough is on sick
leave for the remainder of this term.
The three courses that he was teach-
ing this term will be picked up and
followed through to the end of the

students eager to help out.

The convention has been a tradi-
tion at W&L since 1908. Occuring
every four years when student
delegates gather, they try to pre-
dict the presidential candidate
from the political party currently out
of power. Although the W&L conven-
tion is not the oldest of its kind, it has
a reputation for accuracy and au-
thenticity. The convention has
chosen the correct candidate 13 out of
18 times, and has only been wrong
once since 1948.

However, the convention has not
earned its reputation by haphazard
guessing. It is a result of intensive
research that takes place far in ad-

sick leave

term by Miss Camille Miller. She’s a
doctoral candidate in sociology at the
University of Virginia and a resident
of Lexington.”

Kimbrough had been teaching
courses this term in ‘‘The City,”
“Population” and ‘‘Social Theory.”
He also teaches general sociology,
American sociology, current issues
in sociology, and organization
theory.

Professor Kimbrough has taught at
W&L since 1962. He became depart-
ment head in 1967. Kimbrough re-
ceived his M.A. and Ph.D. in soc-
iology from the University of North
Carolina.

tionnaires are sent out, and each
state’s party organizations are can-
vassed to find out their presidential
preference. When this is completed,
the Mock Convention’s state chair-
men and regional coordinatiors eval-
uate the data and predictions are
made.

It is because of all the hard work
needed to make the convention, that
so much help is needed to put it
together. There are high hopes for
the 1988 convention, but what is real-
ly needed right now are dedicated
people who are willing to devote their
time to ensure that the convention
will be the best it can be.

Frosh midterms are high

 

By PETER BOATNER
Staff Reporter

 

Mid-term grades for the class of
| 1990 were at about the same level as
| last year’s freshmen class, which is

to say at a level unprecedented in 15
years.

The average freshmen mid-term
grade point average was 2.449, down
from last year’s 2.451.

Dean of Freshmen H. Robert
Huntley called this difference ‘“‘in-
Significant.”

Huntley said the mid-terms from
this year and last are easily the best
since 1973, as far back as he had
records.

This year’s junior class, for in-
stance, had a fall mid-term average
of 2.151 as freshmen.

Leading the class with a 4.094, was
a woman, and of the top five aver-
ages, three belonged to women.

The most significant figure drawn
from the grades, Huntley said, was
the small number of freshmen with
averages below 1.5.

This year, only 32 freshmen had
mid-terms below the 1.5 level.

Thirty-seven of last year’s
freshmen were below that level at
this time last year.

“Tf the freshmen keep this up, they
can phase the Dean of Freshmen
out,” Huntley said.

He also noted the dorms have suf-
fered much less damage this year
than in the past, and that the
freshmen seem to be drinking a lot
less in the dorms.

Foundation wants
college changes

 

From the New York Times

 

NEW YORK — The Carnegie Foundation for the Ad-
vancement of Teaching called Saturday for an overhaul
of undergraduate education, including the dropping of
standardized admission tests as a requirement at most
colleges and universities.

A 242-page report by the foundation, portraying the
undergraduate college as a ‘“‘troubled institution,’’ was
sharply critical of the quality of instruction. It found that
the prevailing doctrine that a professor must publish
scholarly treatises to succeed was pushing many into
research when they would rather be teaching.

The study called on colleges to fight overspecialization
by students and require upperclassmen to take seminars
in which the ‘“‘social and ethical’ aspects of their major

field would be explored. It cited what it saw as tensions
between “‘careerism and the liberal arts.”

The report, entitled ‘‘College: The Undergraduate Ex-
perience in America,”’ is the most systematic study ever
done of four-year colleges. The three-year, $1 million pro-
ject involved surveys of 5,000 faculty members, 5,000
undergraduates, 1,000 college administrators, 1,000 high
school students and 1,000 parents.

Ernest L. Boyer, president of the foundation, wrote in
the report, ‘‘The American college is ready for renewal
and there is, we believe, an urgency to the task.”

In making the proposal on admission tests, one of 83
major recommendations, the report characterized as a
‘‘facade”’ the assertion that admission to a college was ‘‘a
victory hard to win.”

The researchers estimated that there were ‘‘probably
fewer than 50 colleges and universities in the United
States today that can be considered highly selective, ad-
mitting less than half the students who apply.” At least
one-third of American colleges, the report said, ‘‘are vir-
tually open-door.”’

Researchers discovered that although students felt
great pressure to perform well on the Scholastic Aptitude
Test and in the American College Testing Program, the
overwhelming majority of colleges based admission deci-
sions instead on grades in high school, involvement in
outside activities and essays included with applications.

Boyer wrote: ‘‘We asked admissions directors how last
year’s freshman class would have differed if there had
been no SAT’s or ACT scores available for consideration.
Sixty-two percent said the absence of such scores would
have made little or no difference in either the size or the
composition of the class.

“The vast majority of students and colleges do not need
a numerical matchmaker.”

George Hanford, president of the College Board, which
sponsors the Scholastic Aptitude Test, said, however,
that Boyer “doesn’t seem to fully comprehend the uses’’
of the examination. ‘It provides a common currency,
even for colleges that are not selective, and is used by
students in deciding which colleges to apply to,” he said.

_ negie Foundation’s resport is the latest in a
serics . American education that have appeared over
the last three years.

‘A Nation at Risk,”’ published in April 1983 by the Na-
tional Commission on Excellence in Education, cited a
“rising tide of mediocrity” in public schools and helped
prompt state legislatures in most states to take steps to
improve education. Five months later the Carnegie
Foundation issued a report titled “‘High School: A Report
on Secondary education in America.”’ It urged significant
changes in secondary schools, beginning with tightened
curriculums and the improvement of salaries and work-
ing conditions for teachers.

“College’’ will be published early next year by Harper
& Row; the price has tentatively been set at $19.95.

Orders can be placed by calling 212-207-7065 or
800-638-3030.

INTENTIONAL SECOND EXPOSURE

OPINION

The Ring-tum Phi, November 6, 1986

 

Faustus U.?

In the November 10 issue of Time magazine, the article
‘What Is College For?” discusses the motives of students at-
tending college today. According to a study done by the
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, most
current high school students and their parents believe the
primary goal of college is to get a well paying job, rather
than to learn.

A sample of the statistics quoted in the article include the
University of Illinois report that ‘‘only 19% of its humanities
students have guarenteed jobs upon graduation, vs. 90% for
business majors.’’ According to U.S. Government statistics
quoted in the article, bachelors degrees in business have
risen from 114,865 in 1971 to 230,031 in 1984, and B.A:s in
English and literature have declined from 57,026 in 1971 to
26,419 in 1984.

It appears that the desire to make money and get ahead
has overpowered the pursuit of higher intellect. Some may
say the concern for fellow mankind is dead, and that most
‘pre-med or pre-law students are only out for the high income
bracket. Is this a valid assessment?

It is to a degree. Students must be realistic. They know in
what sort of lifestyle or environment they want to live, and
they also realize what sort of career they must obtain to
reach their goal.

The pursuit of a career has its limitations when it serves as
an all consuming vacuum. Many business majors hate their
C-school classes. They complain that because a business ma-
jor is so regimented they cannot fit in the philosophy course
or English lit course that they would like to take. If this is the
case, then yes, the pursuit of an academic major for the sake
of income is bad. However, thé majority of business majors
have some sort of interest in their major beyond the money it
will bring them.

Many concerns with students attending college only for a
career are solved in the system of liberal education. Students
get the technical training for the career they want to pursue,
as well as courses in other disciplines.

Certainly, many schools are becoming more business and

' professionally oriented, and this trend is likely to continue
. until high paying jobs for English and Philosophy majors
~ become more readily available. Because so many people are
- majoring in business, pre-med, and pre-law, there will un-
doubtably be a shortage of teachers. Because of the increase
in demand, perhaps salaries for teachers will rise and people
will again pursue these majors.
' Until then, students should evaluate why they are at W&L
' and realize that for some this is the last opportunity they
. have to explore interests outside their intended career.

- and Lee have a tendency to examine their academic stand-
ing. Many have reached the point of being ‘‘out of gas’’;

' burnt out also describes the situation. It is possible that
students need a rest.

The upcoming Thanksgiving break, eagerly awaited by
students, is a prime reason for not having an official fall
break. While it is a reason, it is not reasonable.

The break comes too late in the term to allow students a
needed rest from classes. Unlike the winter and spring
terms, there is no break after six weeks of classes. Instead,
the break comes after ten weeks of classes. Everyone knows
that a W&L, four weeks of classes adds up to a large amount

of work.

Thanksgiving ends up being a week of work away from
school. Students write term papers, read assigned books and
basically attempt to catch up before final exams. This large
amount of work takes a lot away from a holiday when one
should be with family and friends.

A break after the sixth week of fall term would benefit
everyone. Coming earlier in the term, it would help avoid stu-
dent burn-out, which only hurts one’s academic standing.
With mid-terms out of the way and exams not yet in sight, the
work load over break would not be as heavy as it is over
Thanksgiving break.

Shortening the Thanksgiving break would be a feasible
solution to working in the time for a fall break except that a
shorter break would make it harder for some students to get
home for the holiday. A better solution would be to start
freshman orientation and classes one week earlier, which
would put the university on a schedule similar to most other
colleges and universities in the country.

A motion was passed Tuesday by the Interfraternity
Council that will allow the Ring-tum Phi to cover portions
of its meetings. The Phi hopes to cover the meetings as

fairly and accurately as possible, and avoid any problems
in the future.

MY VIEW '
By Chris Carter

 

The scene had all the emotion and,

ning movie. I could hear the two well-’
wishers as they said goodbye to their ,
friend John and wished him a safe
journey. A third friend walked by
and, when told where John was go-*
ing, sadly made the Sign of the Cross ,
over him as she said, ‘‘Oh, you foolish
idealist, you!” With the final com- ‘
ment on who was to receive his col- ,
lection of party tapes and (empty)
beer cans, John bid his friends '
farwell. ‘‘If I don’t make it,”’ he said, «
“tell my folks I loved them and I'm ,
overdrawn at the bank again.’’ No,
John wasn’t boarding the ship to go '
be a missionary to the cannibals in «
darkest South Dakota; he was engag- |
ed in a far more risky proposition, he
was boarding the elevator — to go ‘
down into the bowels of the Universi- +
ty Library for some studying. It was
surely a sign of great courage that
one so young should make such a
valiant gesture for the sake of Mom,
Apple Pie and the GPA. ‘
Perhaps you were unaware of it,
but W&L recently made the “Guin-
ness Book of World Records”
— though not for anything as mun-
dane as high board scores for enter-
ing freshmen, or job and graduate
school placement. No, we got a spot
for having the only elevators in cap-
tivity which break down more often
than British sports cars. In my three
and a half years here at W&L, I can't
remember that both the elevators in
the Library have ever worked at the
same time for longer than two weeks
— and then usually over Christmas
Break! There are probably people
here who have spent as much time
waiting on one crowded elevator
moving at a snail’s pace as they have
spent actually studying — though it’s
possible that this says more about
their study habits than the elevators.
You have to wonder sometimes
about the priorities around here. I
mean, we spend over a million dol-
lars to fix up a house so nice that one
hesitates to breathe in it for fear of
disturbing the antique dust for guests

LETTERS
Freshman agrees with Jones’ My View

To the Editors:

It is an accepted fact that incoming freshmen
are inherently slow on the uptake and, regret-
ably, I am no exception. Nevertheless, I have
managed to stumble upon what seems to be the
consensus on campus. Nobody, and I mean
nobody, likes the Ring-tum Phi. Doesn’t this
bother you, the people most responsible for the
Phi? It should. In fact, it should bother you so as
to compel you to heed Abb Jones’ advice and
seek a faculty advisor. In order to properly
report information to the public (or, in this case,
the student body) the Fourth Estate must first
earn the confidence of the public. In the case of
the Phi, this confidence simply does not exist.
Admittedly, my high school newspaper wasn’t

much, but one problem we did not have was an
avalanche of public disapproval.

Do not mistake me, the Phi is far from a lost
cause. The fact that you ran Abb Jones’ article
proves that the Phi does have the rare ability to
criticize itself. Unfortunately, it also seems to
have the not-so-rare ability to be hypocritical.
Nowhere is this more apparent than in your end-
less feud with the fraternities. Nobody's reputa-
tion or credibility stands to gain in this war of
words, This may come as a bit of a shock, but
fraternities do not represent Nazism, Fascism,
or the Ku Klux Klan. So why don't you call off the

witch hunt?

As W&L’s only school newspaper, the Phi has a
huge responsibility. Obtaining a faculty advisor

would go a long way toward, at last, fulfilling
that responsibility.

Sincerely,

Brian Root

Mock Convention prepares
for the 1988 meeting

By GENIENNE MONGNO
Staff Reporter

Just as the 1986 elections end,
students at Washington and Lee are
already gearing up for 1988. It began
last Thursday with the first organiza-
tional meeting of the Mock Demo-
cratic Convention. About 70 to 80 en-
thusiastic newcomers attended hop-
ing to be able to contribute in some
way.

Co-chairman, Lester Coe, said that
he was ‘‘pleased on a whole’’ with the
turnout. He also noted that although
a lot of people did not show up
because of previous commitments,

Professor Emory Kimbrough,
head of the Department of Sociology,
was forced to leave his position at the
University due to illness but is ex-
pected to return winter term.

The nature of the illness was not
disclosed.

John Elrod, dean of the college,
said, “‘Emory Kimbrough is on sick
leave for the remainder of this term.
The three courses that he was teach-
ing this term will be picked up and
followed through to the end of the

students eager to help out.

The convention has been a tradi-
tion at W&L since 1908. Occuring
every four years when student
delegates gather, they try to pre-
dict the presidential candidate
from the political party currently out
of power. Although the W&L conven-
tion is not the oldest of its kind, it has
a reputation for accuracy and au-
thenticity. The convention has
chosen the correct candidate 13 out of
18 times, and has only been wrong
once since 1948.

However, the convention has not
earned its reputation by haphazard
guessing. It is a result of intensive
research that takes place far in ad-

Kimbrough had been teaching
courses this term in “The City,”
“Population” and ‘‘Social Theory.”’
He also teaches general sociology,
American sociology, current issues
in sociology, and organization
theory.

Professor Kimbrough has taught at

tionnaires are sent out, and each
state’s party organizations are can-
vassed to find out their presidential
preference. When this is completed,
the Mock Convention’s state chair-
men and regional coordinatiors eval-
uate the data and predictions are
made.

It is because of all the hard work -

needed to make the convention, that
so much help is needed to put it
together. There are high hopes for
the 1988 convention, but what is real-
ly needed right now are dedicated
people who are willing to devote their
time to ensure that the convention
will be the best it can be.

Frosh midterms are high

 

By PETER BOATNER
Staff Reporter

 

Mid-term grades for the class of
1990 were at about the same level as
last year’s freshmen class, which is
to say at a level unprecedented in 15
years.

The average freshmen mid-term
grade point average was 2.449, down
from last year’s 2.451.

Dean of Freshmen H. Robert
Huntley called this difference ‘‘in-
significant.”

Huntley said the mid-terms from
this year and last are easily the best
since 1973, as far back as he had
records.

This year’s junior class, for in-
stance, had a fall mid-term average
of 2.151 as freshmen.

Leading the class with a 4.094, was
a woman, and of the top five aver-
ages, three belonged to women.

The most significant figure drawn
from the grades, Huntley said, was
the small number of freshmen with
averages below 1.5.

This year, only 32 freshmen had
mid-terms below the 1.5 level.

Thirty-seven of last year’s
freshmen were below that level at
this time last year.

sharply critical of the quality of instruction. It found that
the prevailing doctrine that a professor must publish
scholarly treatises to succeed was pushing many into
research when they would rather be teaching.

The study called on colleges to fight overspecialization
by students and require upperclassmen to take seminars
in which the ‘‘social and ethical” aspects of their major

field would be explored. It cited what it saw as tensions
between “careerism and the liberal arts.”

The report, entitled ‘“‘College: The Undergraduate Ex-
perience in America,” is the most systematic study ever
done of four-year colleges. The three-year, $1 million pro-
ject involved surveys of 5,000 faculty members, 5,000
undergraduates, 1,000 college administrators, 1,000 high
school students and 1,000 parents.

Ernest L. Boyer, president of the foundation, wrote in
the report, ‘“‘The American college is ready for renewal
and there is, we believe, an urgency to the task.”

In making the proposal on admission tests, one of 83
major recommendations, the report characterized as a
“facade” the assertion that admission to a college was ‘“‘a
victory hard to win.”’

The researchers estimated that there were “probably
fewer than 50 colleges and universities in the United
States today that can be considered highly selective, ad-
mitting less than half the students who apply.”’ At least
one-third of American colleges, the report said, ‘‘are vir-
tually open-door.”’

great pressure to perform well on the Scholastic Aptitude
Test and in the American College Testing Program, the
overwhelming majority of colleges based admission deci-
sions instead on grades in high school, involvement in
outside activities and essays included with applications.

Boyer wrote: ‘‘We asked admissions directors how last |
year’s freshman class would have differed if there had i
been no SAT’s or ACT scores available for consideration. |
Sixty-two percent said the absence of such scores would |
have made little or no difference in either the size or the

composition of the class.

“The vast majority of students and colleges do not need i
a numerical matchmaker.”

George Hanford, president of the College Board, which
sponsors the Scholastic Aptitude Test, said, however,
that Boyer “doesn’t seem to fully comprehend the uses”’
of the examination. “It provides a common currency,
even for colleges that are not selective, and is used by
students in deciding which colleges to apply to,’’ he said.

T negie Foundation’s resport is the latest in a

the last three years.

“‘A Nation at Risk,” published in April 1983 by the Na-
tional Commission on Excellence in Education, cited a
“rising tide of mediocrity” in public schools and helped
prompt state legislatures in most states to take steps to |
improve education. Five months later the Carnegie
Foundation issued a report titled ‘High School: A Report
on Secondary education in America.” It urged significant
changes in secondary schools, beginning with tightened
curriculums and the improvement of salaries and work-
ing conditions for teachers.

Webb to speak at VMI

 

STAFF REPORTS

 

James H. Webb, Jr., assistant
secretary of defense for reserve af-
fairs, will be the guest speaker at the
Virginia Military Institute’s
Founders Day Convocation on Tues-
day, Nov. 11.

A celebrated author and lecturer,
and winner of an Emmy Award for
his coverage of the Marines in
Beirut, Webb has served as a first
assistant secretary to Casper
Weinberger since his confirmation
by the Senate in April 1984.

The convocation, in VMI’s
Cameron Hall, begins at 11 a.m. and

Since Webb’s position in the
Department of Defense is concerned
with Reserve affairs, he might be
considered the most appropriate
speaker possible for VMI. A vast ma-
jority of VMI graduates receive
reserve commissions in all four
branches of the armed forces.

Webb’s first novel, Fields of Fire,
1978, whose topic was ground combat
in Vietnam, was nominated for a Pu-
litzer Prize and was a finalist in the
Hemingway competition for out-
standing first novels. His book, “‘A

Bronze Star medals for valor. He
later earned a law degree at George-
town University and was recognized
for excellence in legal writing there.

Before being named an sssistant
secretary of defense, Webb had serv-
ed as a reporter for Public Televi-

severely affected by the flood in
terms of private property loss, Tuttle
comments that “in a town of 350,
even 10 families suffering loss is a
proportionally high number.”’

The immediate effects of the flood
were great, says Tuttle. ‘“Because
telephone service was cut off, our
priority at the time was obtaining
some means of communication. Peo-
ple needing to get in touch with
relatives found it very difficult to do
so.’’ Fortunately, local radio
operators were able to provide much
of the needed communication in the
first few days.

Afterwards, the largest problem
was finding housing and food for
families whose houses were damag-
ed or destroyed during the flood. ‘‘We
were relatively lucky in helping those
families. Goshen is a very close-knit
community, so finding temporary
housing for those families was not
difficult,”’ according to Tuttle.

Goshen Pass, the scenic 1/2 mile
drive which provides the only access
by car to Goshen, was damaged by
two mudslides, causing it to be wash-
ed out in two places and resulting in
approximately $1 million in damage.
The road was closed during the
spring so that repairs could be made.

W&L junior and resident of Buena
Vista. Though Smith says his house
was undamaged, houses lower in the
valley were not so fortunate, being
below the water level of the Maury
river. Those above the river faced
the possibility of flooding from small
streams emptying into the river from
the Blue Ridge Mountains.

Damage to industry was perhaps
the greatest blow to the town.
According to Foster, the Rea Magnet
Wire Company and Reeves Brothers
Plant, two of Buena Vista’s largest
employers, are in the process of
relocating due to the flood. Lying on
the Maury river, both businesses sus-
tained damages in the millions of
dollars. But flood losses did not
prompt the businesses to relocate

“Due to the lack of adequate flood
insurance,” says Wilford Ramsey, a
local realtor, ‘‘businesses can onlv be
insured up to $250,000 for flood loss.
Insurance companies are unwilling
to offer the larger companies flood
insurance, making it hard for com-
panies like these to cover their losses
when they become too high,”’

Fortunately, volunteer efforts
after the flood enabled residents to
begin cleanup almost immediately.

Area colleges played no small
parts in volunteer efforts. Virginia
Miliitary Institute contributed to
10,000 man hours, with 670 cadets
participating in cleanup efforts
throughout the county. Southern

Preparing for parents

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Assignments Editor

If you think the guy down the hall’s
a real ‘‘momma’s boy,” or if you’ve
ever wondered what kind of car the
parent of a Porsche-driving college
student owns, this may be the
weekend to find out.

About 1,200 parents of Washington
and Lee University students are ex-
pected to be in Lexington this
weekend for W&L’s 32nd annual
Parents’ Weekend. The purpose of
this event is to give parents a chance
to visit their children and learn more
about W&L, said Carter McNeese,
the school’s associate director of
development.

“The one thing I hope is different
from last year is that we don’t have
another flood,’’ he said.

Although McNeese was only joking
when he referred to the deluge that
devastated Western and Central
Virginia last Election Day, parents
and their kids could be in for a rather
soggy weekend. As of Wednesday

night, the Associated Press’ extend-
ed forecast for the state called for a
daily chance of rain Friday through
Saturday. Highs should be in the mid
50s to the mid 60s, with lows in the
40s.

McNeese, who is coordinating his
15th Parents’ Weekend, said the only
addition to this year’s program was
an open house for freshmen, law
students and their parents at the
home of President and Mrs. John D.
Wilson on Saturday afternoon.
Wilson’s house was built by Robert
E. Lee in 1867.

Lee Chapel will be filled with the
sounds of music during an 8 p.m.
vocal and instrumental concert.
President and Mrs. John D. Wilson
then will serve as hosts for an infor-
mal reception in the Evans Dining
Hall.

Panel discussions with faculty, ad-
ministrators and students will be
held Saturday morning from 9 to 11,
followed by Wilson’s report to the
parents at 11:30 in the chapel. A

luncheon in the dining hall will last
from 12:15 to 1:15 p.m. The cost for
adults is $6.50 or 4% points for point-
card holders.

In athletic action, W&L’s grueling
8,000 meter crosscountry course will
be the site of the men’s and women’s
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
cross-country championships, at
11:30 a.m. and noon, respectively.
The football Generals will take on Ur-
sinus at 1:30 on Wilson Field.

About two-thirds of the parents
who signed up for this year’s
Parents’ Weekend have sons or
daughters who are freshmen or
sophomores, McNeese said. The
numbers are split pretty evenly be-
tween the two classes.

Although the main funciton of the
development office is to raise money,
McNeese stressed that fund raising
was in no way the purpose of
Parents’ Weekend.

Students hurting for cash, how-
ever, just might disagree.

Preparing for travel

By CHRISTIE CHAMPLIN

Staff Reporter

As Thanksgiving and Christmas
vacations approach us, students who
have not already done so must begin
to schedule travel arrangements as
soon as possible. There are two
travel agencies in Lexington which
can help students make reserva-
tions: Herring Travel and Travel
Unlimited.

The decrease in competition bet-
ween the airlines, due to the large
number of mergers and acquisitions

in the airline industry, has increased
the cost of travelling by air;
however, many airlines have in-
stituted thirty day advance purchase
rates which reduce the round trip
fare, said Collins. The rates for
travel during the holiday seasons are
higher than those of the rest of the
year even though the special fares
reduce the rates 60 to 70 percent. Am-
track has introduced the All-Aboard
America Fare to the majority of its
markets. This fare provides round
trip transportation for the price of a
one-way ticket plus $7. These reser-
vations can be made anytime before
departure. Collins said, “If anyone

needs to make arrangements for
Christmas, they need to do so as soon

as possible.”’

It is still possible to make reserva-
tions for Thanksgiving, but there
could be a problem getting back by
Dec. 1 if students want to fly into
Roanoke because W&L, Virginia
Tech, Radford and Virginia Military
Institute all use the same airport,
said Collins.

To make arrangements students
can go to or call Herring Travel at
463-2197 or Travel Unlimited at
463-7174.

Soccer sets new
record; just misses

the D-Ill

By GARY McCULLOUGH
Staff Reporter

 

After starting the season with three
losses in it’s first four games, the
Washington and Lee men’s soccer
team didn’t look to be going
anywhere fast, but looks can be
deceiving.

The team pulled itself together and
won 10 of it’s last 11 games, as well as
the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
gerence title. In the process, the
team set school records for both wins
and goals in a season.

Last week the team wrapped up it’s
season with wins over Maryville and
Averett.

The Generals capped off their
record breaking season with a 4-2 vic-
tory over Averett College on Smith
Field last Monday. This gave the
team their record setting 11th win
and was an impressive finish to the
season.

On Saturday, the Generals bom-
barded the Maryville Scots with eight
goals, their highest offensive output
since the 8-0 win over the University
of the South earler this season.

The Scots could manage only a
single tally in response to W&L’s
assault and became the General’s
10th victim of the season.

The team’s final record for the 1986

playoffs

season stands at 11-4 overall and a
perfect 5-0 in the ODAC.

In light of their fast finish there was
some talk of a bid to the NCAA Divi-
sion III tournament. However, when
the tournament field was announed,
Washington and Lee was not among
the invited teams.

When asked how the team reacted
to missing the tournament, Senior co-
captain Peter Van Son, said, ‘“They
{the tournament officials] take four
teams from each region, and the
other teams were already ranked
above us. We thought we had a
chance, but we weren’t really too
disappointed.”’

Even though the General’s didn’t
make the tournament, they still had
an outstanding season. They won the
ODAC and set school records for both
wins and goals in a season.

In addition, there were several
record-setting individual perfor-
mances as well. Junior goaltender
Chris Gaeris set a school record for
career shutouts, and freshman
Patrick Brown set a new mark for
assists in a season.

In light of the team’s finish and
record setting performances head
coach Rolph Piranian was optimistic
about his team’s chances if they had
gotten a tournament berth. ‘“‘They
better be glad they didn’t give us a
bid to the tournament.”

Football follows bouncing ball to first win of the season

 

by JIM LAKE
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington & Lee football
team recorded its first win of the
year last Saturday, a 28-14 victory
over Bridgewater. The Generals, led
on offense by quarterback Jon Thorn-
ton, running back Chris Coffland, and
split-end Randy Brown, closed out
their 1986 Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference season with a 1-4 record.

“We showed intensity and ag-
gressiveness throughout the game,”
said Generals head coach Gary
Fallon. ‘“‘It was a real team effort.”

After a scoreless first period, the
Generals struck first on a 1-yard run
by Thornton with 10:30 left in the sec-
ond. Nine minutes later, the Eagles
tied the game at seven when Adrian
Mobley scored from one yard out,

and the score remained 7-7 at half-
time.

Washington and Lee started the
third period with a 90-yard touch-
down return of the opening kickoff by
Coffland, but the Generals couldn't
relax for long, as the Eagles nearly
returned the ensuing kickoff for a
score. However, the W&L defense
held, shutting out Bridgewater for
most of the quarter. Then, with two
minutes left in the period, Mobely
recorded his second 1-yard TD carry
of the afternoon, tying the game at
14.

But the Generals responded by
scoring as many points in the fourth
quarter as they did in the first three.
Only 18 seconds into the final period,
Thornton launched a 44-yard pass
deep for Bobby Wilson. The ball
bounced off of an Eagle defender, but
Wilson came down with it, putting the

Generals up for good. W&L defender
Mark Oluvic recorded his second in-

later, stalling the Eagles hopes for a
fourth quarter rally. Then, with 3:30
remaining, Coffland scored his sec-
ond touchdown of the game on an 11-
yard carry. Seconds later, W&L
defensive back Robert Rimmer ap-
peared to ice the victory with a 41-
yard interception return. But Fallon,
remembering his team’s last-second
loss to Randolph-Macon four weeks
earlier, was still not certain that the
Generals had locked up a win. While
trying to run out the clock on their
subsequent possession, the Generals
faced fourth down, and Fallon sent in
the field goal team. The Eagles were
assessed a 5-yard penalty for en-
croachment, and the additional yar-
dage gave the Generals a first down
and an opportunity to secure their

first win in seven games.

Looking at the game as a whole,
Fallon was particularly pleased with
the play of Thornton, who completed
10 of 16 passes for 127 yards, threw
for one touchdown and ran for
another, and was not intercepted.
(When) you give Jon enough time,
and he has a little bit of early suc-
cess, he just gets better. I was really
pleased with his performance,” said
Fallon.

Coffland continued the versatility
which he displayed against Sewanee,
playing three different positions and
returning kickoffs. Split-end Brown
led the Generals in receiving with 6
catches for 75 yards.

Friday and Saturday, 10-3

2-4-1, and Fallon called them ‘‘a very
tough opponent.” Although they are
not as big as some of the teams the
Generals have faced, Ursinus is
quick on defense with some ex-
perienced linebackers, said Fallon.
The Bears are led on offense by a
first-year starter at quarterback,
who Fallon said will throw to his
backs and tight ends as much as his
wide-outs. However, the Bears
are capable of both running and pass-
ing the ball. “Once again, our
defense is going to have its hands
full,’ predicted Fallon.

Looking at the Bears as a whole,
Fallon is reminded of Sewanee.
While Ursinus does not have any tru-
ly great individual players, they do
have several good ones “‘on both
sides of the ball.”’

“If we’re not ready, they’ll give us
more than we can handle. But if we

are ready, then we’re going to have a
good football game,” concluded
Fallon.

HASHMARKS — B.J. Sturgill, who
missed W&L’s first six games
because of a leg injury, played his
first game of the season last Satur-
day and made all four of the
General’s conversion attempts...
Tailback Kevin Weaver, who did not
practice Monday or Tuesday last
week because of a leg injury, gained.
85 yards on 28 carries against
Bridgewater. Weaver should be at
“100 percent’’ for the game against
Ursinus according to Fallon... The
Bears lost to Muhlenberg College last
Saturday, 24-18... Head coach Ster-
ling Brown has a 13-19-2 record in five
years at Ursinus... This will be the
last home game for 16 W&L seniors.
Over the past four years, the
Generals have a 20-15 record.

Spiders and zebras

combine to beat polo

 

By MATHEW HORRIDGE
Staff Reporter

 

 

In a very odd Southern League
championship game Saturday night,
the water polo team succumbed, 18-8,
to its nemesis — the University of
Richmond.

“We didn’t play very well,” head
coach Page Remillard said.

The Generals, seeded second in the
tournament, blew by Duke and
George Washington in day games
before facing No. 1-seeded Richmond
in the championship game Saturday
night.

Incompetent officiating had a ma-
jor effect on both teams and the
game, Remillard said.

“The officiating was so unprofes-
sional...the team didn’t respond
well,’’ Remillard said.

There are three ratings for water
polo officials: A, B and C, with A be-
ing the most experienced. All three
officials for Saturday night’s game
were C-rated and one’s only prior ex-
perience was a high school tourna-
ment.

There were 34 ejections — much
like hockey penalties — in the game,
17 for each team. A player fouls out
after three ejections.

Co-captain Simon Perez fouled out
in the first quarter and David Dietz
was gone before the first half ended.

“It (the officiating) was no better
for Richmond than it was for us,”
Remillard said, but the Spiders ‘‘ad-
justed to the incompetency of the of-
ficiating better than we did.”’

Two Richmond players were kick-
ed out of the game in the first half for
asking for clarification of officials’
calls.

Four minutes into the first quarter,
Dave Herbert, a George Washington
University water polo player, pushed
Remillard into the pool.

Several players and Remillard
said the incident epitomized the
“circus-like environment” of the
game.

When Remillard was pushed, the
game was tied at 2-2. At the end of the
first quarter, however, the score was
4-2 and Richmond never looked back.

“It wasn’t an 18-8 game,”’ one W&L
player said, noting that no other
W&L-Richmond game this year has
ended with a score difference greater
than three.

This week, the Generals have tried
to get Saturday’s fiasco out of their
minds to prepare for this weekend’s
Eastern Championships at the Naval
Academy in Annapolis.

W&L works for a shot against Richmond on Saturday.

Their first game is Saturday at
noon against Brown University
Brown, ranked among the top twenty
Division I teams, squeaked by W&L
earlier this season in a game that
went into double overtime, 15-12.

Remillard said he expects Brown
“to be very prepared” for Saturday’s
match-up. One benefit Brown has go-
ing into this game is that their pool,

like Navy’s, is official-sized — no
shallow end and much bigger than Cy
Twombly Pool.

“T expect to play a very, very good
game,” Remillard said.

If the Generals win against Brown,
they will face the winner of the
Bucknell-Richmond game in the sec-
ond round.

Generals place 2nd in tune up for Sat.’s ODAC’s

 

By ANN STEWART
Staff Reporter

 

At a regional meet in Lynchburg
last Saturday, the Washington and
Lee men’s team placed second
among seven teams.

Emory University placed first with
40 points followed by the Generals
with 65.

The Generals were led by Scott
Rippeon who placed fourth with a
time of 26:50 for the 5.1 mile course.

Senior Ash Andrews said that the
team really didn’t expect to beat
Emory, but he was very pleased with

their performance at Lynchburg. An-
drews believes that the 5.1 mile
course was fast this year.

The course at Lynchburg is a dif-
ficult course with lots of places that
can break a runner’s speed and tem-
po, but this year it was also wet, ad-
ding to the difficulty.

Senior Ted Myers was also im-
pressed with the race Saturday.
Myers placed sixth with a time of
27:03. He feels that the competition is
much better this year, and that two
years ago, his time would have won
the conference.

At Lynchburg, the Generals beat

Cliches willnever die

Cliches and sports. The two are inexorably bound to one another.
They can no more be separated than can Laurel and Hardy, peanut
butter and jelly, the Pirates and last place. No, it would be unnatural
to tear cliches from sports, not to mention impossible.

Why, I’m sure you're asking, talk about cliches in such cosmic
terms? Well, it’s because they add a dimension to sports that would
otherwise be absent — predictability.

It is never 100% certain what the outcome of any contest will be
however, you can always be sure of what the coach will say before a
game.

Imagine this scenario: Undefeated Huge State University coached
by Dirk Armstrong has a game scheduled this weekend against the
winless Kalamazoo Institute for Left-handed Violinists coached by
Wilbur Snedeker. Certainly not a game destined to be counted among
the world’s great struggles.

While the game is not a complete lock, I’d be willing to wager that
coach Dirk Armstrong is not spending his nights worrying about
Kalmazoo’s devastating pass rush or some similar subject. But, of
course, he won’t admit it.

‘We can’t underestimate our opponent,” the coach will warn. ‘‘The
game will go to whoever wants it more.”’

Or you might read Armstrong say, ‘“‘We take the games as they
come, we won’t get caught looking past an opponent.”

On the other side of the field, the underdog’s coach, Wilbur
Snedeker, is tossing about such original statements as: ‘‘We go into
every game expecting to win, and this week is no exception,” or ‘We
expect all our players to give 110%, and if they do we have a good shot
to win,”’ or even my personal favorite, ‘‘On any given day, any team is
capable of beating any other team.”’

But don’t think that it’s only the coaches who keep a box of phrases
nearby, ready to be dusted off in the event of an interview. The
athletes themselves have quite an arrary of trite statements at their
disposal.

Take, for example, a ballplayer who bas been a bench jockey for
most of the season, Pepper McDuffy.

It’s the bottom of the 15th inning and the manager has used every
pinch hitter on his roster, except Pepper. The manager looks over at
him and growls, ‘“‘McDuffy, you hit.’’ Pepper jumps up, runs over to
the rack and chooses a bat, and heads to the plate.

You have no idea how Pepper is going to fare in his at-bat, but it’s no
mystery what he’ll say in the locker room following the game.

“I’m just happy to be contributing to the ball club,” (an athlete will
always refer to his team as a ball club, never as just a team) Pepper
might tell you that, “I know my role on the ball club and I’m happy
with it,” or he might say, “I consider myself lucky to be on this ball
club.” Uh, thanks Pepper.

This tendency towards cliches that sports figures have often creeps
into their everyday life as well.

Picture football coach Sam Bullock at the dinner table. First, his
wife brings out a plate of lima beans, then a steak, followed by rice
pudding for dessert. When his wife asks how he enjoyed the meal
coach Bullock says, ‘Well honey, when you brought out those beans it
looked like fourth and long to me, but you showed a lot of character by
serving that steak, and it was certainly the turning point in the meal.
After that, you came up with the big play and the rice pudding was a
big score.”’

People have come to expect these types of cliches from sports
figures, and if they don’t deliver, it’s quite a shock. Imagine your sur-
prise if Wilbur Snedeker from the Kalamazoo Institute had said,
“Yeah, there’s no way we can beat Huge State U., we’re just in it for
the payday....”’

By CHRIS CARTER
Drama Critic

 

If, as eighteenth century writers
believed, the purpose of literature is
to delight and to instruct, then in the
play Roscius, produced by the
University Theatre and running
through tomorrow night, we have an
ideal play. Written by Rose Gordon
and directed by Professor Al Gordon
of the W&L Drama Department,
‘‘Roscius”’ employs a host of ex-
cellent actors in a fascinating plot,
making for a thoroughly enjoyable
evening.

The play is about the great eigh-
teenth century actor and playwright,
David Garrick, who was nicknamed
Roscius by theatre-goers of his time
after the greatest actor of the Roman
Empire. The setting is the eve of Gar-
rick’s last performance as he reflects
upon what he has accomplished in his
life and on the factors which have
motivated him in his accomplish-
ments. Gordon has attempted here to
show how Garrick’s financial success
and desire to be accepted in the up-
per classes of society made him an
outcast in the “family of theatre.”
Thus, we see scenes from both the
public and private sides of Garrick’s
life and from the earlier and later
periods of his career.

The reflective nature of the plot
allows Ms. Gordon to play some in-
teresting games. Throughout much
of the play, an ‘‘audience’’ sits on
stage. When scenes from eighteenth
century theatre are being acted, the
audience makes the comments which
eighteenth century audiences would
have made and is, in effect, histori-
cally real. In other episodes from
Garrick’s private life, and in the
reflective scenes, the audience to the
drama of Garrick’s life acts as a sort
of conscience for him. The devise,
though hardly unique, is better
employed than is often the case and
is highly effective.

But more than such boring
academic points as plot or structure,
what makes ‘‘Roscius’”’ work is the
amazingly high level of acting which
almost every member of the cast
maintains. The lead is played by pro-
fessional Paul Norwood, an alumnus
of 1973. Mr. Norwood’s three years in
the Folger Shakespeare Theatre
clearly serve him in good stead in the
many scenes from Shakespere (Eng-
lish majors, be advised: this play is a

‘Roscius’ delights, instructs

James Shillington (Quinn) and Paul Norwood (David Garrick) perform

great way to brush up your Shake-
speare for Comps) and he demon-
strates throughout the production the
naturalness and sponteneity which
were the hallmark of Garrick’s style.
Female lead Susan Still should be
well-known to W&L audiences
through her memorable portrayal of
Portia in last year’s production of
“The Merchant of Venice’’, as the op-
pressed actress Susannah Cibber she
brings us another brilliant perfor-
mance. Garrick says of Cibber that
her Desdemona had no equal — we
might well say the same of Ms. Still.
Against performances such as Nor-
wood’s and Still’s, we might expect
that the rest of the cast would seem
pale and lifeless. Happily, nothing
could be further from the truth. W&L
Professors George Ray and James
Shillington are both deserving of
praise in their respective roles as the
classical actor Quin and the famous

literary figure Samual Johnson. One
can only regret that the character of
Johnson wasn’t given more lines so
that Shillington, who certainly looks
the part, could really develop the
character. Area theatre-goers have
come to expect Veterans Susan
Crouse, Frank King, and Craig Smith
to distinguish themselves with highly
professional performances, but
rookies Micheal Dixon and Mike Car-
roll should give everyone a very plea-
sant surprise. Dixon’s Samuel Foote
is altogether solid, and Carroll’s Lord
Chamberlain should bring down the
house with its combination of pom-
pous ass and dirty old man. This
minor part is a real show-stealer.
The rest of the cast is too large to
commend all by name, but I would be
a jerk indeed not to call attention to
Madeline Bergstrom’s charming ren-
dering of Molly, the child of Susan-
nah Civver.

If any criticism is to be made of
‘‘Roscius,”’ it is perhaps the lack of a
historical dialogue. In a play which is
as concerned with a_ historical
literary genre such as eighteenth
century drama, we might expect
more use of the idiom of the period.
In its costumes, sets, and music (all
Handel) ‘‘Roscius’’ captures the
eighteenth century rather well, so
there are times when its language is
conspicuously anachronistic. But this
is a minor quibble.

The only serious disappointment I
had was the ridiculoulsly small au-
dience. Ms. Gordon has written a
very good play, which is ably direct-
ed and acted, and it seems a shame
that they should perform to anything
less than a full house. Blow off your
work for a couple of hours tonight
and go see ‘‘Roscius’’ — it’s tree, it’s
informative, and it’s fun. What more
could you want?

By SAM FOLEY
Staff Reporter

 

Acting Police Chief Lt. Beard ap-
peared at the Inter-Fraternity Coun-
cil meeting Tuesday evening. Beard
became the acting chief after Chief
L.O. Sutton resigned last week citing
philosophical differences.

“T certainly want to continue a
good relationship with you fellas,”
said Beard. He then invited the
members of the IFC to share their
grievances with him.

For about thirty minutes the IFC
representatives laid their complaints
before the acting chief. Several
members complained about the
policy the police have on issuing a
noise violation.

Beard took note of the complaints
from the IFC members and tried to
clarify the operating procedures that
his department would follow.

In dealing with noise violations,
Beard said that before midnight an
officer will issue a verbal warning. If
the officer has to come back, a writ-
ten warning will be issued. After this
the officer will issue a summons for a

Nice sack!!!

W&L General Jim Thornton runs up on John Nozemack as he sacks the Ur-

noise violation.

If the officer must come after mid-
night, the verbal and written warn-
ings will be given at the same time.
This , if necessary, will be followed
by the summons.

“Technically the cut-off is at mid-
night when the sound permit ex-
pires,”’ Beard said.

Beard also stressed that an officer
can close down a party at any time he
feels the party is out of control.

Beard also addressed the subject of
an officer’s entrance into a fraternity
house, He said he had no problem
with an officer being asked to wait at
the door while a house officer is sum-
moned, provided the party is not too
disruptive. ‘‘I have no problem with
that as long as the person who greets
him cooperates. I certainly want to
meet you half-way. If you go the
other half, everything will be fine,”’
he said.

Before Beard left, he acknowledg-
ed the pressures and problems that
face fraternities and said, ‘“‘You’ve
got to be more responsible. I’m not
saying that you are not responsible.
I’m saying that for your own good
you have to be more responsible.”

NCAA rules Coffland ineligible; W&L plans

 

By STEVE POCKRASS
Assignment Editor

 

Washington and Lee University
running back Chris Coffland was rul-
ed ineligible to play football last
week by the National Collegiate
Athletic Association because he was
not registered for 12 academic
credits this fall

The decision is being appealed

“It’s insane!’ said W&L Athletic
Director William D. McHenry, his
face reddening as he karate-chopped
at his wooded desktop yesterday
afternoon. ‘‘It’s ridiculous!”

McHenry was dumbfounded by last
Thursday’s interpretation of an
NCAA rule after he routinely called
to confirm Coffland’s eligibility. The
cause of the dispute is W&L’s non
traditional academic calendar, in
which the first two terms last 12
weeks, and the third lasts six
Because of the calendar, W&L
students take fewer credit hours per

term than students at many other
schools.

NCAA bylaw 5-1-C requires that a
student-athlete ‘‘be registered for at
least a minimum full-time program
of studies as defined by the institu-
tion.’’ Nine credits are required at
W&L, according to the school
catalog

The bylaw also requires the athlete
te he “fegisterca in 3
minimum of 12 semester or quarter
hours, “or a. similar minimum
academic load as determined by the
NCAA Eligibility Committee in an in-
stitution that determines registration
other than on a traditional semester-
or quarter-hour basis or conducts a
cooperative educational program.”

Coffland, a junior from Baltimore,
is considered a full-time student in
good standing at W&L. But the NCAA
has applied its 12-hour requirement
to his fall term, making him ineligi

Lexington Police Chief Lawrence
O. Sutton resigned last week after
nearly three- and one-half years as
the city’s top police administrator.
City manager Joseph C. King made
the announcement Friday morning.

King declined to comment on the
resignation, but Sutton said that “ir-
resolvable philosophical differ-
ences’’ with King led to his decision
to step down. ‘‘I thought a lot about
this resignation,” Sutton said, “‘but I
was waiting to see where he was
coming from and how we could func-
ion together. This was not a spur of
the moment type thing,’’ Sutton said.

King has been city manager since
August 18. He replaced John V.
Doane, who resigned because his

thought that relations between
fraternities and the police will im-
prove. ‘‘I think you are going to see a
change in the attitude of the police
department. They will probably be
easier to get along with. Easier to
talk with. And easier to work things
out with.”

But Atkins warned the represen-
tatives about letting too many
uninvited guests into the parties and
the problems involved in allowing
guests to drink outside of the house.
Both situations could necessitate the
police having to come to the house
and this is a situation both sides want
to avoid.

In other business, the IF'C announc-
ed that its annual canned food drive
would start next Monday and run
through December 10. Last year, the
IFC raised approximately $4,000 in
canned food, and they hope to sur-
pass that figure this year.

In addition, the IFC voted on its
constitution Tuesday evening. After
several minor alterations, the con-
sitution was accepted by a vote of
15-0 with two abstentions in the first
of two required votes.

emption,” said McHenry, now in his
16th year as athletic director. ‘‘Un-
fortunately, I cannot prove this with
any document.”

McHenry and Sports Information
Director Mark Mandel both question-
ed how the NCAA would apply the
bylaw to the school’s spring term,
when no students are registered for
12 credit hours.

The university is sending a written
appeal to the NCAA Eligibility Com-
mittee, McHenry said. W&L Presi-
dent John D. Wilson will make the ap-
peal personally ‘

‘We plan to appeal it and fight it,”
McHenry said. ‘‘We hope to have it
overturned soon.”

Wilson, a standout defensive back
on Michigan State’s 1952 national
champion football team, was out of
the state yesterday and could not be
reached for comment.

“We have not done anything im-
proper,’’ McHenry said

‘We certainly feel that Chris Cof
fland has not done anything wrong,”

wife accepted a position with a
Washington, D.C., law firm.

Following Sutton’s resignation, Lt.
Bruce M. Beard, 42, was named act-
ing chief of police. Beard also served
as acting chief in 1982 and 1983, when
a police theft ring was being pro-
secuted.

Thirteen Lexington police officers
were indicted in the ring, which stole
merchandise from local stores.
Seven were convicted and left the
police force.

Sutton, 56, a former Virginia Beach
policeman, became chief following
the scandal. In a press release, King
cited Sutton for restoring ‘‘a degree
of professionalism’’ to the depart-
ment.

A nation-wide search will be con-
ducted for a permanent replacement,
King said, although local candidates,

including those currently on the
police force, will be considered.

Finding a new police chief could
take three to four months, be
presented to the Lexington City
Council at its meeting on November
20.

King thinks Beard would make a
qualified candidate for the vacancy.
“It’s premature for him to indicate
interest in the position, but | would
hope he would apply.”’ King said.

In his press release, King also in-
dicated that he would ask the City
Council to approve a severence pay-
ment equalivalent to three month’s
salary for Sutton.

Sutton plans to take some time off
for hunting season before he makes
any decisions about his future in law
enforcement. ‘‘At this point, I have
no direct plans,”’ he said

ODAC changes

By MIKE SHADY
Assistant Sports Editor

 

 

The structure of Washington and
Lee’s athletic program, as well as
those of the rest of the schools in the
Old Dominion Athletic Conference,
may be in for some drastic changes.

This Monday and Tuesday, Novem-
ber 17 and 18, the athletic directors of
all 13 ODAC schools will travel to the
Ingleside Country Club in Staunton,
Virginia, for the conference’s twice-
yearly meeting. The meeting is call-
ed to take care of any business
related to the conference.

The foremost issue at this fall’s
meeting is the proposal regarding the
out of season rules and regulations
for each school’s fall, winter and
spring sports.

Three types of rules are scheduled
to be voted upon. They are:

1) The elimination of all out of
season practices. Direct coaching
supervision, the issuance of uniforms
and the top priority given teams for
the use of athletic facilities will all be
discontinued.

2) The establishment of a starting
date for each individual sport. The
fall season will begin no earlier than
August 20; the winter season on Octo-
ber 15; and the spring season on
February 1.

3) The institution of a set max-
imum number of contests or dates a
team may play. In the case of sports
such as cross country and wrestling,
meets and tournaments will be con-
sidered as one date and not as
separate contests with each par-
ticipating team. Some of the propos-
ed numbers are below those already
instituted by the NCAA.

The idea for these curbings
orginated in the mind of W&L’s
Athletic Director William McHenry.
The proposal was first voted on in a
special ODAC meeting, held at W&L,
on May 28, 1986. The idea, however,
had been on the table long before
then.

“The proposal was something we
had wanted to plan for all year but we
had no time,” said Sports Informa-
tion Director Mark Mandel. “‘So we
set aside May 28 for this specific

may come soon

meeting.”

At the meeting, Mandel said the
proposal gained approval by vote but
that it was just the initial stage. The
first vote was “unofficial’’ and only
gave the proposal the opportunity to
be discussed and voted upon ‘‘of-
ficially”’ at the upcoming meeting.

A poll of the athletic directors
revealed that at the present time, six
of the 13 ODAC schools are for the
proposal with one school, Hamp¢en-
Sydney, still undecided.

Lynchburg, Eastern Mennonite,
Emory and Henry, Maryville and
both Randolph-Macon and Randolph-
Macon Woman’s College are against
the proposal. Washington and Lee,
Roanoke, Sweet Briar, Hollins,
Bridgewater and Mary Baldwin are
the schools in favor of the sports
limitations proposal.

Many of the athletic directors
pointed out that sports limitations
are a good idea, but the National Col-
legiate Athletic Association should
have to implement the regulations,
not the ODAC conference.

“The NCAA is sufficient to govern
the conference,’ said Aubrey Moon
of Lynchburg College. ‘“There is not a
severe problem in the ODAC and the
proposal presents a_ definite
recruiting disadvantage.”

“We are NCAA oriented,”’ said Ted
Keller of Randolph-Macon College.
“Tf the NCAA eventually comes out
with the limitations, we would cer-
tainly abide by them. Then it would
be equal for everyone. Each school
should be able to take care of their
own program,” he said.

The athletic directors at
Bridgewater and Hollins both em-
phasized the importance of the con-
ference leading the way for the im-
plementation of new limitations
across the board in Division III.

Hampden-Sydney, whose vote
could prove to be the decisive one,
stil] remains undecided on the issue

‘“‘We have to examine the ins and
outs and facts and figures before we
can make a decision,’’ said Louis
Miller of Hampden-Sydney College

Extensive discussion will precede
the final vote and all views are ten-
(J See ODAC, page 4

 

he stressed.

McHenry also emphasized that
W&L was not under NCAA investiga-
tion and that it had not been forced to
forfeit its first win of the season, a
28-14 triumph at Bridgewater two

weeks ago.

“There is no investigation. There’s
nothing at all.”

Bridgewater Athletic Director

Tom Kinder said yesterday he would
not ask W&L to forfeit the game. Dan
Wooldridge, commissioner of the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference, said
it would not be proper to comment on
the conference’s position until after
the NCAA made its final decision

McHenry said Coffland approach
ed him at the start of the school year

id asked if there would be a pro
_.2m with his taking an underload of
10 credits. McHenry told him that the
NCAA required all atheletes to be
full-time students and that to take an
underload, he would need approval
from his advisor and the Faculty Ex
ecutive Committee

an appeal

The Faculty EC approved Cof
fland’s underload petition on Oct. 6,
contingent upon his taking 14 credits
in the winter term. But when the peti-
tion went before the entire faculty for
approval at its Nov. 3 meeting, Pro
fessor Samuel J. Kozak raised the
eligibility question and the petition
was tabled

McHenry could not attend the
faculty meeting because he was out
of state on family matters.

Coffland told McHenry about the
problem last Thursday. McHenry
then called Steve Horton of the NCAA
legislative services for a ruling

‘He immediately said he was in
eligible,’ said McHenry. “I had no
idea that they would rule that way

services secretary, told a Phi
reporter yesterday that a depart

o freebies

“This week’s “Talkback” asks the guestion, ‘“‘should the
«t)W&L Student Health Center offer free birth control?”

“This is a touchy question, to say the least (no pun intend-
»-ed). By offering birth control, some argue, students are en-
‘» couraged to take more responsibility for their actions, to

think not only of themselves, but of their partner as well.

“Free prophylactics could be beneficial in preventing the

_ noreading of disease.

“ Others claim the availability of free birth control en-

44 courages students to have sexual relations before they are
_steady. It may convey the attitude that sex before marriage
«or promiscuous behavior is acceptable, an attitude not

everyone shares.

: Moral questions aside, should the Infirmary spend money
"in order to save the student body the trouble of going to the

drugstore?

There is no problem with the idea of providing birth con-
“trol. Indeed, if it were provided, the only excuse for not using
,..it would be sheer laziness (or stupidity). Birth contol should
...be provided to those who need it and cannot otherwise afford
it. Yet the average W&L student certainly can afford to buy
= or her own birth control.

_ The present system is acceptable. The Health Center offers
“prescriptions or fittings for birth control. However, after ob-:

“taining that prescription, students must pay for the pills or

. device. (Incidentally, the Health Center has found that for
..women choosing to take birth control pills, it is cheaper to ob-
‘tain pills through the local Health Department, rather than
buy them at drugstores.) At first, this system seems biased
toward women, but when the new birth control method for
males that consists of injecting hormones into a male’s arm
becomes more widespread, perhaps then the Infirmary could
offer this method.

- If birth control methods are available over the counter, the
Infirmary should not spend part of its budget to provide these
products. It should, however, continue to offer those methods
which require the supervision of a doctor.

—MED
COUNTERPOINT

Free for all

“ The question of whether or not Washington and Lee should
‘provide birth control is, indeed, a touchy one. However, there
re a number of valid reasons that the University should
this service, the first and foremost of which is the
health and welfare of all W&L students.

~ The prevalant reason for the use of birth control is, of
course, to prevent pregnancies. However, in today’s world of
AIDS and herpes, birth control devices can become impor-
tant factors in preserving the health of students. Prophylac-
tics have been shown to decrease the chances of transmitting
diseases through sexual contact. With the threat of the AIDS
epidemic on W&L’s horizon, steps should be taken to prevent
the spread of the disease either heterosexually or homsexual-
‘ly.

Condoms are not cheap; the temptation is too great to ‘‘do
without.” By supplying them, the infirmary is helping to
avoid the spread of diseases as well as unwanted pregnan-
cies. This is not to say that a program warning students of the
‘dangers of AIDS and such should not be started. In fact, it
would only help the students.

» If the University is providing birth control devices for
thales, it is only fair to provide some option for females.
Whether birth control pills, diaphragms or sponges, females
should be afforded the same protection as males.

“If a policy such as this was to be adopted, there would un-
Joubtedly be an outcry about morality on campus being ig-
jored. However, with today’s sexually open-minded
students, the university would be doing a grave disservice to

the W&L community if it completely ignores the issue of free
birth control.

Until recently, I did not mind get-

And I mean a real space, not a spot

actual swath of pavement. I am talk-

Things began to change as I notic-

dying breed. Sightings became rare
and when they happened, were much
talked about. I often found myself
popping the curb and pulling onto the
gravel shoulder to leave my car. I
thought that there was no way that
things could get worse. I was
definitely wrong

A few days ago at a quarter to
eight, my anger and my hatred came
to fruition. That morning, before the
bell had even rung, there were no
spaces in the Corral: no real spots, no
places on the curb, no room on the
grass, not even by the front arch —
all were taken. .

something about their progress, but
as long as the professor is going to
take the time to make the estimates,
he might as well give the students
some information they can really

Perhaps the worst scenario is the
one in which the professor assigns
grades which are too high or too low.

If students become mistakenly '

To the editors:

I hate to be the one to put salt on old wounds,
but someone must. I noticed one thing missing
from this year’s Parents’ Weekend, not many
parents of every minority student on campus
showed up, the turn-out would be dismal at best,
primarily because this year W&L’s minority
enrollment is less than three percent. The ad-
ministration of W&L must do something about
this problem.

As a black student, this problem really hits
close to home and frustrates me to no end. I have
heard rumors of the administration planning to
correct this problem, I feel that this effort is
not only a response to growing criticism, but it
is also occuring very late. In the past four
years, the number of incoming freshman minori-
ty students has declined steadily and this year’s
freshman class should not have only been an in-
dication of how serious the problem is, but it
should have initiated immediate action. Sending
staff members out on recruiting misions is a
start, but prospective students will only listen to
faculty and staff so much.

What we need to do is establish a minority
recruitment group, ‘made up of faculty and
students, whose sole purpose is to attract
qualified minority students to our campus. As
vice-president of the Minority Student Associa-
tion I have discussed this idea with our members
and I found that student input would be no pro-
blem and if necessary, our entire organization
would become a part of this recruitment group.

The EC’s budget this year made it quite ob-
vious that they are not willing to help with this
problem. In the budget meeting this year, we re-
quested money for a ‘‘majority weekend” which
would have not only attracted qualified minority
applicants, but would have shown white students
what it feels like to be inthe minority while going
to school, Not only did the EC shoot down this
proposal, it asked why we did not have dues for
our organization. This is simple, our participa-
tion is already low and if we charged dues it
would be even lower.

I am pleading with the administration to take
immediate action with regard to this problem, If

me or my organization can be of any assistance
we will be more than willing to assist.

Sincerely,

Alumnus defends Smith

To the editors:

My sincerest sympathies go out to my alma
mater. I’ve just read the October 23 edition of the
Phi, and, to my horror, I see that Markham Pyle
continues to haunt the halls of Washington and
Lee.

As a fellow member of the class of 1984, I am
sorry to see that Mr. Pyle learned nothing of
freedom of speech and respect for others opin-
ions while he was an undergraduate. It is a sad
fact that he still finds it necessary to berate the
character of individuals he, more than likely,
does not even know

Whether we agree or disagree with Paul
Smith’s opinions on the Reagan administration’s
stand on SDI at Reykiavik. we should at least
respect his right to express those opinions and be
thankful that the University community is open-
minded enough to allow expression of opposing

ts.

I do not deny Mr. Pyle’s right to express his
views on SDI, the Soviet Union, or his extensive
knowledge of modern history. However, it dis-
gusts me that he thinks he has the right to per-
sonally assault Mr. Smith for his views on any
subject. Further, for Mr. Pyle to ever assert that
he is “the voice of the Old W&L’’ is enough to
make General Lee rollover.

An integral part of Washington and Lee is pro-
viding an atmosphere for intellectual growth,
part of which is exposure to diverse ideas and
mutual respect for each individual’s ideas,
whether we agree or disagree.

This respect is inherent in the concept of honor
which is, and always will be, the foundation of
the W&L experience. There is no “‘old”’ or ‘“‘new’’
W&L. There is only one. The one that will always
embody the ideals of honor and responsibility to
others, Hopefully, as Mr. Pyle lingers on in Lex-
ington, he will eventually understand and absorb
these ideals.

Finally, congratulations to the staff of the Phi

on a job well done this year and good luck in your _

continued efforts to provide a forum for discus:
sion of all sides of the issues affecting the W&L
community.

Reader praises curriculum

To the editors:

Despite the pessimistic future of higher educa- |
tion predicted in the editorial entitled ‘“‘Faustus
U.?” in the November 6 issue of the Phi, I cannot
totally agree that ‘‘the desire to make money and
get ahead has overpowered the pursuit of higher
intellect” here at Washington and Lee. W&L-ites
may often consider their majors of utmost im-
portance while ignoring the required basics as
something to ‘‘get out of the way.”’ If “technical
training for the career they want to pursue is
overwhelming these students, then they have un-
fortunately missed out on one of the joys of
attending a small, liberal-arts college.

The general education requirements and elec-
tives account for 51-89 credits out of a necessa
121 for graduation. True, a student may choose t
concentrate his electives in his major, but at the
very minimum, 37 credits in the core curriculum
along with English composition and foreign
language proficiency is required. The “Time”
article ‘‘What Is College For?”’ suggests that the
study of ‘language, the arts, history, social and
governmental institutions and natural science”’
provides everyone “regardless of individual
goals’’ with “‘a base of essential common know-
ledge.” W&L encourages students to take classes
in certain areas of concentration, but at some
point the individual must accept the duty of for-
mulating his own comprehensive plan of study.
The University has provided the student body
with a smorgasboard of educational possibilities
in the general requirements — but it is the
responsibility of the serious student to sample
those classes that interest him and allow the

One destoyer and two guided-missile
cruisers cruise into the harbor of
Quindao. Sailors on board wave to
their Chinese counterparts on the
docks. The U.S. Naval Band strikes
p “Happy days are here again”.
The mood is festive, as flags wave in
the wind. This visit by the U.S. Navy
is the first since 1949, when U.S.S
Dixie made its way to Hong Kong,
carrying the last American ser-
vicemen stationed in Qingdao.

The naval visit is indicative of the
changing relationship between the
U.S. and China. With an increasingly
important cultural and economic
elationship developing between the
wo countries, it is not surprising that
a military complement would soon
arise. And so it has. Not only in the
ecent example of Naval coopera-
tion, but also, and particularly in the
areas of military technology sharing.
Earlier this month, for example, the
Chinese signed an agreement to buy
$500 million in advanced U.S. radar
and other electronics for Chinese-
built F-8 jet fighters. In fact, since
1983 the Chinese have been involved
in the purchasing of military combat
cr combat support materials from
he U.S. The short-term logic of the
eagan administration’s efforts to
increase military cooperation be-

that fundamentally believes in its
cultural, political, and intellectual
superiority. Its desires for extended
military ties with the U.S. are on a
need-to-use basis only.

But there are those in the ad-
ministration as well as US State
Department who would argue that
they are fully aware of these
realities. They argue that the advan-
tages accrued in building up China to
face the Soviet Union far out-weight
any risks in the long run.

But the problems don’t stop there.
Basically if we rearm China we must
face the very real possibility that
China may change its military
strategy, that conceivably such
strengthening on the part of the U.S.
might lessen Peking’s fear of the
Soviet threat to its own national
security, and might, contrary to
Washington’s expectations, ac-
celerate a Peking-Moscow recon-
ciliation. Such reconciliation would
be advantageous to both parties; the
Soviets could reduce the number of
troops on the Soviet-Chinese border
and re-deploy them on the European
border against an indecisive NATO,
where they would be much more ef-
fective. The Chinese could gain con-
cessions from the Vietnamese, via
Soviet prodding, such as the con-
tested Spratly Islands in the South
China Sea, of which the Vietnamese
occupy eight, as well as border con-
cessions.

Thus an American-armed China
not only could become more entren-
ched in the Soviet camp, but could (if

it doesn’t alreau, ~ore a significant
threat to South Korea, ‘wan, and
the Phillipines.

American military policy toward
the People’s Republic should be reex-
amined by the present administra-
tion in terms of the potential long-
term impact of this unidirectional
military technological flow.

The desire for better economic and
cultural relations which are bene-
ficial to both countries should not be
confused with military cooperation,
which is marred by the fundamental
differences in political objectives and
motives that exist between the two
countries. These differences are real
and not likely to change; thus careful
consideration is warranted.

Gaines Hall scheduled for Fall’87 completion’

 

By BECKY REYNOLDS
Staff Reporter

 

Bang, crash, roar: these irritating
sounds flaring six days a week from
the corner of Washington and Nelson
Streets and beyond are actually bit-
tersweet. The noise and dust are
results of construction on the new
residence hall which will house
Washington and Lee upperclassmen
next fall.

The Gaines Residence Hall, sched-
uled to be completed by September,
1987, is named for Doctor Francis P.
Gaines. Gaines was president of the
University from 1930 to 1939.

Gaines Hall was designed by Mar-
cellus Wright Cox and Smith, the
same firm. that designed the library

 

 

and Woods Creek, Apartments,,The J]... ..+

floor plan consists of 8 single «|

bedrooms within suites, 59 double
bedrooms within suites, 21 detached
doubles and three detached singles
for a total of 248 beds. A suite consists
of various combinations of bed-
rooms, a living area, closet space
and private bathroom facilities.
However, there are no kitchen facili-
ties within each suite.

The actual structure of Gaines Hall
will consist of four progressive main
levels. It will feature a gatehouse
which will be situated directly on the
corner of Washington and Nelson
Streets. Containing comfortable
lounge furniture and perhaps a piano
for everyday use, the gatehouse will
also be used for University lectures,
concerts and meetings when needed.

There will be two other lounges
that will have small, convenience kit-
chens, as well as a computer room
with word processing equipment and
study carols, and an exercise room
on the lower level of the residence
hall. This room will serve as an alter-
native for the weight room in the
gymnasium.

The structural atmosphere of the
building will resemble the classic col-
legiate style. The main entrance will

be from a central quad. “The design

 

 

 

Artist’s conception of

of the suites gives it a lot of flexibility
with possible living set-ups for clubs,
special groups, sororities, etc. if
necessary in the future,” said Frank
A. Parsons, executive assistant to
President Wilson.

Gaines Residence Hall is just that
— a residence hall. It is not called a
dormitory “because a dormitory con-
jures up an image of long hallways
and no common space. By calling ita
residence hall, there is a degree of
gentility given,” according to Par-
sons,

Resident advisors will live in
Gaines Hall. According to Parsons,
the advisor will “maybe take on a
‘unity role’ to help get people
together as a University,” in addition
to providing information and
guidance.

funded through an_ industrial
development bond issue. Raising
funds from individuals for the new
hall is unnecessary because the hall
should pay for itself eventually.

Rates have not been set for rooms;
however, the prices will stay in line
with other University pricing
policies. Parsons revealed that
“when W&L builds student housing,
we take a different approach beyond
freshman year because our housing
competes with housing in town. The
cost won’t go over the market rate
but will need to be sufficient to cover
the cost of Gaines.”’

When asked if he thought the new
residence would deter interest in
Woods Creek, Parsons said, ‘“‘we still
think Woods Creek will be our prime
housing space.’’ Because Woods

for those who complain about the
»k of moral ethics in business prac-
es, they need look no farther than
2 Washington and Lee Business
hics Institute.
The three day program, devoted to
cussing current ethical dilemmas
nmonly faced by today’s busi-
ses, begins Friday night at 8:00 in
rthen Auditorium with a lecture
keynote speaker Elmer W. John-
“The Virtues of Managerial
ectiveness.’’ Johnson, Vice-
‘sident and General Counsel of
neral Motors Corporation, is ‘‘not
y a good speaker from a business
wpoint, but being well read in
losophy and theology, is articulate
the subject of ethics as well,”’ ac-
ding to Harlan Beckley, professor
éligion at W&L.
lembers of the University com-
nity may remember Johnson as

including a $7622 coffee-pot and a
$181 rechargeable flashlight. She also
examined the problems of spare
parts expense, such as a plastic
navigators’ stool cap which was
bought by the Air Force for $975.26,
which was made from 26 cents worth
of plastic material.

In her book, Rasor calls A. Ernest
Fitzgerald, a noted whistleblower,
her mentor. Fitzgerald, a former
cost control analyst for the Air
Force, began the current wave of
whistle-blowing when hc testified in
1968 before the Joint Economic Com-
mittee’s Subcommittee of Economy
in Government about the cost over-
runs of the C-5 plane, which was
believed to be $2 billion over the
predicted price. Fitzgerald was fired
after a reshuffle in the department of

the Air Force in which he worked.

Rasor received a B.S. in political
science and journalism from the
University of California at Berkeley.
She worked at ABC News and the Na-
tional Taxpayers Union, a non-
partisan organization which _in-
vestigates the use of tax revenues.
She left the NTU after a disagree-
ment with them over percentages
figures in an investigation.

“‘My only objectives are to stop bad
weapons from reaching the bat-
tlefield and to stop the government
from wasting taxpayers’ money,”
Rasor said of her work.

Rasor’s speech is being sponsored
by the Washington and Lee chapter
of the Society of Professional Jour-
nalists, Sigma Delta Chi, and is free
and open to the public.

By MARGARET PIMBLETT
Staff Reporter
Nearly every week, the

Washington and Lee campus is
covered with posters publicizing
fraternity parties for the weekend.
But according to Associate Dean of
Students Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy” Atkins,
the papers are unnecessary and
should not be hung.

In an interview Tuesday about
alcohol policies on campus, Atkins
said, ‘‘Fraternities shouldn't be put-
ting up posters because they
shouldn’t be having open parties.
That’s not a regulation of the Inter-
fraternity Council, but I’m positive
that every fraternity that has a
chapter on this campus has a na-
tional policy which forbids open par-
ties.”

Atkins emphasized that the policy
is not meant to be snobbish or ex-
clusive, but that insurance liability is
too great to ‘allow anybody and
everybody that wants to, to come toa
party.”

He said that the IFC prohibits

posters emphasizing alcohol. ‘There
was a policy made by the IFC at
some point in the past that posters
put up to advertise parties could not
and should not have any reference to
alcohol or the servii g of alcohol, and
that parties should not have alcohol
related themes,’’ he said.

“If you go back,’’ Atkins said, “‘to
the basic, common sense guidelines
set down by all the nationals, they
shouldn't be advertising their parties
anyway. They ought to be sending in
vitations.”’

As the director of greek affairs and
student activities, Atkins advises the
IFC. He does not administer regula-
tions to the fraternity system. ‘‘All of
the rules which govern fraternities
are made by the Interfraternity
Council,” he said.

According to Atkins the constitu-
tion and bylaws of the IFC are sub-
ject to the approval of the Student Af-
fairs Committee, an and ‘‘the IFC is
expected to discipline those frater-
nities which break the rules and don’t
comply with regulations. But, the
SAC has the power to overrule the
IFC and either increase or reduce the

The Business Ethics institute is a
product of the course in Business
Ethics offered in the fall. Taught by
Beckley and Business Administra-

course is an examination of the

varied as whistle-blowing, exporting
of goods to third world nations, and
product safety.

“The business ethics field has

The Business Ethics Institute was
introduced in 1982 as part of the
Society and the Professions pro-
gram, according to Religion Pro-
fessor Louis Hodges. Hodges, in an
effort to create a comprehensive pro-
gram in applied ethics for students
interested in various fields of study,
founded the program in 1974. Since
then, programs in applied ethics
have been given for those interested
in the fields of law, medicine, and
journalism.

Outside of the Friday night lecture,
the Business Ethics Institute is
restricted only to those students tak-
ing the course in business ethics and
guests from the business community.
Many of the guests are alumni, and
come from businesses as far away as
San Francisco.

“Not only does this give the
students a chance to discuss many of
the same problems we allude to in
class with those who deal with them
on a daily basis, but it provides in-

sight as to how these leaders, many
of them former students, handle
themselves when faced with the
ethical problems business so often
face,’’ said DeVogt.

“The issue of product safety,
especially as it concerns the Ford
Pinto, and the issue of Affirmative
Action are on the agenda as topics for
discussion. These are pressing pro-
blems for business leaders, and ones
calling for a measureable degree of
social responsibility,’’ DeVogt ad-
ded.

Should people interested in the sub-
ject still attend the lecture, given its
business-oriented nature? “By all
means,’’ said Beckley. ‘‘While
philosophers have been the keynote
speakers in the past, Mr. Johnson’s
familiarity with ethics-related pro-
blems from a business perspective is
made all the more important by his
interest in problems of philosophy
and religion. It promises to be an in-
teresting lecture.”’

Atkins stressed again the ad-
ministration’s conviction that ‘‘the
ABC laws will be obeyed at the Stu-

“We have a clear-cut set of

pavilion is that since that is universi-
ty property and the university is
sponsoring a function there when-
ever the SAB or other student organi-
zations use it for parties, the ABC
laws have got to be obeyed.’’

Atkins mentioned the idea of a beer
garden, or ‘“‘alcohol limited to a sinail
area where only a small percentage
of those people who attend could con-
sume beer. That would require a jot
of control and security, so I’m it
sure it would be worth the effort.’’

Atkins said he hoped the Student
Activities Board would begin en-
couraging a ‘‘different kind of party

The ODAC holds two of these

new regulations, other business and
issues related to the conference will
be resolved at the meeting.

“All schools have gone home and
re-thought about the proposal and
will now revote on the same three
isues,’’ said Mandel.

“No one is taking away the
athlete’s opportunity to train or

srs. Brown, Rimmer
and Thornton lead
football to 2nd win

;

‘ By JIM LAKE
, Staff Reporter

 

 

'

Led by senior wide receiver Randy
, Brown on offense and senior corner-
back Robert Rimmer on defense, the
’Washington and Lee football team
»recorded its second consecutive vic-
tory last Saturday, rolling over the
‘Bears of Ursinus by a score of 28-7
‘before a Parents’ Weekend crowd of
,over 5,000. Brown, the leading
receiver in the conference, caught
"nine passes for 189 of senior quarter-
«back John Thornton’s 251 passing
yards, while Rimmer intercepted
"three passes and had a total of nine
‘tackles, six of them solo.

The game started ominously for
the Generals, as the Bears blocked
“sophomore Tom Skeen’s punt deep in
: W&L territory and scored three plays
.later on a 4-yard run by quarterback

Cliff Repetti. But three minutes
‘later, the Generals tied the score
‘ with the longest run from scrimmage

in W&L history. With the ball spotted
_at the W&L 11, senior tailback Kevin

Weaver took the handoff from Thorn-

‘ton and started towards the left
tackle. He broke past the Ursinus
linebackers with some outstanding
footwork and then showed the great
‘acceleration which has given him the
lead role in the nightmares of so
many defensive coaches. The senior
tailback raced the final 50 yards com-

pletely untouched, and senior B.J.

Sturgill added the extra point that

tied the score with 8:13 remaining in
the first quarter. The Generals would
never trail again.

In the second quarter, the Generals
took advantage of the Bears’ preoc-
cupation with Weaver. The Ursinus
defensive scheme was to ‘‘put an out-
side linebacker right in the middle,
and wherever Kevin went, he went,”

according to head coach Gary
Fallon. The Bears thus left
themselves with single coverage on
Brown, and sophomore cornerback
Steve Sacco was completely over-
matched by the speedy and ex-
perienced senior. Brown pulled in a
40-yard pass from Thornton which
put the Generals in scoring position,
and Brown scored seconds later on a
37-yarder. Sturgill’s extra point clos-
ed out the first half scoring with the
Generals in command, 14-7.

In the second half, the Bears drop-
ped back into a more balanced
defense, allowing the Generals to
return to the ground game and the
ball-control offense which they have
used most of the season. Two second-
half interceptions by Rimmer and
one by senior safety Joe Krastel
allowed W&L to keep the ball on the
ground and run time off the clock.

The Generals extended their lead
on a 7-yard run by Weaver for his se-
cond score of the day. Sturgill added
the extra point with 1:29 remaining in
the third period, and W&L went up by
14. Junior running back John Roe
scored his first touchdown of the
season from 32 yards out with 1:51 re-
maining in the game to nail down the
victory. The win lifted the Generals
overall record to 2-6.

The Generals will close out their
1986 season this Saturday afternoon
in Meadville, Pennsylvania, with
their first game ever against
Allegheny College. The Gators are
5-4, coming off of a 23-0 shutout by
Grove City. Fallon said that the
Gators have a big defensive front
with an aggressive secondary.
Allegheny will ‘give us quite a test
for out offense,’’ predicted Fallon.

Offensively, the Gators feature two
outstanding tailbacks. ‘‘They’ve got
an explosive attack utilizing those
two’’ in tandem, said Fallon, with a
capable freshman at quarterback.

Saturday.

“They have a chance at a winning
season and will give an all-out ef-
fort,” said Fallon. ‘In order to win,
we must maintain our aggressive-
ness and intensity.”’

HASHMARKS — This was the
twelfth game in Weaver’s career in
which he has rushed for over 100
yards, Before he gained 146 yards on
21 carries Saturday, the senior co-
captain sang the national anthem...
Sturgill has made all 8 of his PAT’s

since returning to the lineup for last
week’s game with Bridgewater...
Allegheny head coach Peter Vass is

For the season, freshman linebacker
Mike Pack leads the defense with a
total of 85 total tackles. Skeen is sec-
ond with 78, followed by junior tackle
Jay Gorlowski with 61, who leads the
team in sacks with 4... Rimmer now
has 4 interceptions on the season to
lead the Generals in that category.

 

 

Shades on sports

Limitations? You bet

When the athletic directors of each ODAC school meet this Monday
and Tuesday, a proposal will be put on the table that, if passed, will
severely restrict the out-of-season goings on in the sports programs of
those respective schools. The proposal is long overdue.

Take a look around you. How many two or three sport athletes do
you see? Not many, and the number is declining every year. In this
marvelous age of specialization, an athlete has no choice but to follow
the trend and cut down his participation to just one sport. The
demands, out of season, are just too high for an athlete to meet. So in-
stead of risking the wrath of the coaches, the athlete decides to limit
himself to only one sport.

Wake up Shades, this stuff doesn’t happen in Division III, does it?

Unfortunately, even D-III isn’t safe. National championships are na-
tional championships, be it D-I or D-III, and the coaches are just as
willing to make the sacrifices necessary to obtain these coveted titles.
Suddenly the season isn’t long enough and other measures must be
taken in order to produce a winner.

Wait just a minute. Are you saying there is something wrong with a
winner? Get a grip, Shades. Winners, not losers, are what people want
to see.

The problem is that D-III sports is not designed for this win-at-all-
costs philosophy. Call me a romantic, but I’ve always thought (and
still do) that D-III athletes play the sport because they enjoy it; not to
win national championships or All-America awards.

The major criticism of the proposal is that it leaves the conference
at a disadvantage against competition outside the conference (Read:
we won’t win any non-conference games, thus, no tournament bids).
Another point mentioned is that the athlete is being denied the oppor-
tunity to become the best he can be.

Nothing could be further from the truth. More than once I have
heard D-III athletes compiain about practices with the age old state-
ment, ‘“‘We’re only Division III, so I can’t believe we have to practice
so hard.”

If an athlete wants to train or practice out of season, it can be done
on his own time and when he wants to do it. If he wants it bad enough,
the hours of work will be put in and the performances will, as a result,
be enhanced. He doesn’t need some power-hungry coach who only
cares about ‘‘W’s”’ telling him to get his butt in gear.

If the national championships come, fine. I’ll welcome them with
open arms. But at the D-III level, academics is first and foremost. It’s
not fair for the few who have to put in the out-of-season time (as if the
in-season time is not enough) when they don’t want to just because the
coach will be upset.

That’s what D-I and D-II athletics are all about. It’s about time that

something is instituted that ensures that D-III does not fall into the
same mold. Fun, excitement and an emphasis placed upon
academics; that’s what D-III sports are all about. That’s the way it
should be. Period.
NOTES: Sugar Ray Leonard will receive $11 million to fight

Four school records fall as swimmers make wavesin opener

By MATHEW HORRIDGE
Staff Reporter

The 1986-1987 men’s and women’s
, Swimming season opened in an im-
pressive fashion last night with the
“women recording their first victory
‘and the men breaking four school
‘records.

The women defeated Mary
‘Baldwin, 101-69, and the men beat
, their cross-town rivals VMI, 121-84.
The Generals won every race in the
‘contest.

The 400-yard medley relay team,
composed of David Olson, Martin
‘Radvany, David Dietz and Jeff Ber-
‘caw, qualified for the national Divi-
, Sion III championships with a time of
3:34.69. The relay team also broke
,the eight-year-old school record of
3:35.69.

Freshman David Olson, in his first
,race as a W&L swimmer, broke the
,school record for the 100-yard
backstroke (54.07) while swimming

the first leg of the 400 medley relay
_race. Olson qualified for nationals in
the 200-yard backstroke with a time
of 1:57.82, which broke the school
record held by senior Jay ReVille.

Sophomore David Reavy perform-
,ed a similar feat in the 200-yard
freestyle race by qualifying for na-
tionals with a school-record time of
1:43.84.

In the 50-yard freestyle race,
| sophomore Jeff Bercaw qualified for

' nationals with a time of 21.21.

that fell from the [record] board to-
day,’ said head coach Page

The Washington and Lee water
polo team closed out the 1986 season
last weekend in the Eastern Cham-
pionships at the Naval Academy,

The Generals opened the weekend
with a tough loss to 10th-ranked
Brown University, 18-8.

In their second game, the Generals
dropped a heartbreaker to the Cadets
of the Military Academy, 9-8, in triple
overtime. With 1:34 left in regulation,
the Generals scored twice to pull

 

 

No rest for swimmers following seventh
place finish in Eastern Championships

seven with the Cadets at 8-8.

The Generals held tough for two
overtime periods but let the winning
goal by in sudden death overtime.

The weekend — the season — end-
ed on a high note with an 11-6 victory
over Harvard.

“lam very pleased with the way
we played this weekend,”’ said head
coach Page Remillard.

The Generals placed seventh in the
tournament and finished the season
with a 21-11 record.

Co-captain Simon Perez said the
Generals had a good season.

“The water polo seaon was suc- |”

cessful because we had 21 wins
— more [wins in a season] than in the
last two years,”’ he said., ‘‘but we feel
we didn’t play up to our potential.”’

Remillard echoed Perez’s
thoughts: ‘“‘We improved throughout
the season...[and] we are looking for-
ward to continuing our improvement
next year.”

The Generals’ team this year was
composed mainly of freshmen and
sophomores and will lose only three
players to graduation in June.

| Athletic Director McHenry speaks out about his ODAC sports limitations proposal

 

 

Interview by Mike Shady
Compiled by David Emrich

Ring-tum Phi: When did you first think of the proposal?

Athletic Director William McHenry: My concern, for
several years, has been the abuses that are taking place
in intercollegiate athletics. Not necessarily at
Washington and Lee at all because I don’t think in any
way do we abuse the length of the seasons. I think the
seasons are too long and we’re asking our athletes to
participate in too many games. I think that out of
season practice is infringing upon their rights to par-
ticipate in other sports. I have been concerned with this
for probably four or five years.

R: When you first drew up the proposal did you expect
opposition from other athletic directors in the con-
ference?

M: Absolutely. First of all, let me say, I spoke on the
NCAA floor to the Division III athletic directors on two
occasions on this subject and was to by the other
athletic directors: This is a great idea, these are things

that should be done for Division III, but we can’t do it
for a particular sport — which is the sport of their in-
terest. When I proposed this to the athletic directors of
the conference, | was appointed as the chair of an ad-
hoc committee. There was almost unanimous accep-
tance of the recommendations that we made. I fully ex-
pected that there would be some opposition after we had
made the recommendations.

R: Some athletic directors feel that the present NCAA
rules are good enough. Why should the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference be any different?

M: I felt that perhaps if the ODAC took a leadership role
in the NCAA that we could show that we have some con
cerns as a conference — not just Bill McHenry as
athletic director — that we have concerns about the
abusive times involved with athletic problems

R: Some of the other athletic directors in the ODAC also
feel that if some changes were made in the original pro
posal that they would pass it. Would you make some
concessions inorder to get this thing passed?

M: Absolutely. This is on the floor for discussion. My in-
tent when we drew this thing up was to take it back to
the coaching staffs and ask them to shoot whatever
holes into it they want, and for us to come up with a pro-
posal that is acceptable and yet would take care of some
of the problems. I am concerned with a growing trend of
more and more out of season games and more and more
time for out of season practices by other institutions.
It’s the old story you have to keep up with the
Joneses, you have to do what they do or you’re going to
lose ground and that’s not the right attitude, as far as
I’m concerned

R: If the proposal fails, what would be the next step?

M: If the proposal fails entirely it would be a dead issue,
and I would continue to work through the NCAA to try to
have some legislation passed to put some sanity into
Division III sports programs

R: If the proposal passes, what do you think would be
the reaction of athletes and coaches, especially here at

Washington and Lee?

M: I can’t see how any of our sports would be affected
negatively with the possible exception of our tennis pro-
gram, which has a very good fall program and that’s a
unique situation because our tennis coach is also our
wrestling coach and he loses preseason time in the spr-
ingtime. Our lacrosse team is trying to establish itself
as a strong Division III team and they may be han-
dicapped, and there may be some others. Golf has a
program that would be affected slightly. But, there are
certainly differences that you should consider, between
perhaps individual sports and team sports and that’s
one thing that hasn’t been addressed here in this pro
posal

R: Do you think that if the proposal passes that other
conferences in the country of the NCAA as a whole will
follow suit?

M: Well, I don’t know if they’ll follow suit but I think
what our job will be as administrators is to try to show
that this can work and be effective so that other people
will want to do the same thing. The only way it will ever
really be totally successful is if it’s done on a national

basis.

Bruce offers treasure chest

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Entertainment Editor

Well, it’s here

Bruce Springsteen and the E Street
Band Live/1975-85. Five records,
three cassettes, or three compact
discs of live Bruce Springsteen. The
digitally mastered bootleg album of
your wildest dreams. A_ treasure
chest for the faithful. The New Testa
ment of the MTV generation. The last
Christmas gift on earth

There are 40 tracks, so if anything
is missing, you can’t blame Columbia
records for not trying. You name it
and it’s on here. Everything from
“Thunder Road” to ‘‘Racing In the
Street,’ from ‘Born To Run’ to
“Born In the U.S.A.” is packed on
this massive set, all pristinely mixed
and charged with as much “‘live”’ ex
citment as can be coaxed from a
piece of vinyl

Sophomore Tony Waskiewicz, on of
the faithful, bought Lexington’s first
copy last Tuesday at the Flipside
record store. He called it “the icing
on the cake *

Lexington resident Jane Horton
Marcella bought a copy for her hus-
band, saying, “It’s sort of our
history. My husband and I met in col
lege in '75-'76 and it is interesting for
us to follow this along.”’

Although not necessarily a Spring
steen fanatic, third year law student
Ed Graham bought a copy on the
basis of seeing the Boss live.

“Tt was the best live show I’ve ever
seen,” he said.

Flipside owner Bill Cooper said his
store originally ordered 36 copies: 13
lp’s, 19 cassettes and 4 CDs. His Tues
day order was short, however, as he
only received half the number of Ip’s
and CDs he ordered.

“I’m not sure we could have done
any better getting things in,’’ Cooper
said. “If our su pliers are short, than
the customers come up short.’

The set is selling for $28.19 in lp and
cassette and $49.19 in CD. The store’s
mark-up for the CD is, according '
Cooper, less than that of the cassette

Cooper said Columia records does
not have its own CD pressing plant;
rather, all its compact discs are
pressed in a Sony plant in Indiana
Apparently, once this initial pressing
is sold out, there won’t be anymore
CDs until January.

Columbia’s first printing is some

things that aren’t on the new record.
On the other hand, he said, ‘I’m sure
it’s gonna sound better than the stuff

The procurement scandals within
the United States Department of
Defense will not be solved until the
public forces Congress and the ad-

Dina Rasor in a lecture in Lee Chapel

“It is up to Congress, the politi-

Brandt Wood, the junior class Ex-
ecutive Committee representative,
and Christopher de Movellan,
sophomore class representative, at-
tended an Honor Symposium James
Madison University last Thursday
night.

Representatives from George
Mason University, Mary Baldwin
College, the Virginia Military In-
Stitute, as well as from JMU and
W&L, participated in a panel discus-
sion which was the focus of Honor
Awareness Week at JMU.

Each school was allotted time at

the beginning of the discussion to pre-
sent a brief overview of its Honor
System. According to Brandt Wood,
the other schools were interested in
the single sanction system used by
both VMI and W&L.

Wood stated that the other schools
were also concerned with how aware
the W&L students are of the Honor
System, the extent to which the facul-
ty supports it and how much faith
there is in the Honor System. He ad-
ded that answers were often given
from the White Book, and he attri-
buted a large part of the success of
the Honor System to the fact that it is
completely student run.

Wood’s impressions of the discus-
sion were that VMI and W&L had the

most to share with the other repre-
sentatives because of the single sanc-
tion. Wood noted that VMI’s Honor
System does have the fourth point,
which states that failure to report a
breach of the Honor System is con-
sidered an honor violation.

This, too, was a topic of interest to
the audience because of the problem
encountered by many schools where
students do not report honor viola-
tions. Wood said that W&L does not
have this problem because the
students realize how important the
Honor System is to W&L. “The
students realize that their freedoms
are in jeopardy if honor violations go

need for education in ethical leader-
ship. There are no substitutes for
directors and managers of moral
stamina,” said Paul, an_ ethics
teacher at a prestigious Virginia
university.

Paul is not a member of the W&L
faculty, but a character in a dialogue
written by Elmer H. Johnson, key-
note speaker for last weekend's
Business Ethics Institute. Johnson,
vice-president and general counsel of
General Motors Corporation, used

couple of fraternity brothers picked
up prior to Monday’s meal. He
said if it was anything more than
that, it was probably just a bad
batch of food, and ‘‘not the cook’s
fault.”’

University physician Dr. Fred-
erick A. Feddeman, however,
believes the sickness is ‘‘probably
due to food poisoning.’’ Feddeman
said that the symptoms and the
time period between eating poison-
ed food and showing the symp-
toms, which is usually about thirty-
six hours, fits. He added that some
people are more resistant to it
than others, which is one explana-
tion why some people who ate din-
ner did not become ill.

lustrate some of the problems ac-
companying the advent of the busi-
ness ethics field.

Johnson, through the discussion of
his characters, pointed out many
questions even business leaders have
trouble answering. For exampl- for
what ultimate purpose does th —r-
poration exist? In the dialogue, Mar-
tin, a chief executive officer, or CEO,
of a major corporation, believes it ex-

ists solely for the maximization of
profits of all stockholders. Conse-
quently, any interference, whether
legal or contractual, that hinders this
purpose should be minimized. In
other words, government and other
checks on big business should be kept

toa minimum

Tuesday night grew to the point
that only the sickest could remain
overnight.

Kappa Sigma food manager Jef-
frey Branflick, who is suffering
from the illness, said he thinks it
is only a virus, and not food
poisoning, causing the trouble. He
said that although he has never
had food poisoning, the symptoms
he is suffering from ‘‘seems like a
basic stomach virus.”

Branflick also said that as food
manager, he works closely with
cook Linda Wooding, and that all
of Kappa Sigma’s food is fresh, for
“she is a very competent cook.”
He also pointed out that Wooding
and two fraternity brothers were
suffering from a virus with the
same symptoms Monday.

Are we to believe this argument,
which some would argue is reflective
of the economic idealogy of the cur-
rent national government? ‘‘No,”’
said Hilary, who in the dialogue is a
corporate law experate at one of the
country’s top law firms. ‘‘Corpora-
tions today have no owners; they
have stakeholders, which include
stockholders, employees, manage-
ment and even the public. Business
has the obligation of protecting all of
its stakeholders, as they all are af-
fected by any decision the company’s
board of directors makes.”’

Whether one holds this view or not,
Johnson's dialogue pointed out many
of the problems associated with large
multi-national corporations

“One of the questions business

profit organization which in-
vestigates waste, fraud and mis-
management within the defense con-
tracting industry. Rasor stated in her
speech that the Project has four ma-
jor guidelines. ‘‘First, we look at
military procurement. It is not the
Project on Foreign Policy, or the
Project on Arms Control. Instead, we
are looking at the defense budget and
spending machine. Second of all, we
are nonpartisan. Third, we are not
going to discuss the strategy of
nuclear weapons, but will look at
nuclear delivery systems. Lastly, I
decided at the beginning that we
won't take classified documents. It’s
against the law, and the Pentagon
would use that to discredit me
against the people inside, my
sources. If I leaked classified
documents, I would show to those
people a basic disrespect for the
security of the country.”

Rasor obtains her information

from a network of ‘‘concerned’’
sources within the defense depart-
ment which she calls the ‘Pentagon
Underground.” She divides those
sources into two categories. ‘‘One I
call the ‘more bucks’ underground,
the ones concerned that we are pric-
ing ourselves out of existence with
weapons, and the other is the ‘less-
bang,’ in the sense that every new
generation of weapon has become so
complex and so expensive that it will
never become realistic on the bat-
tlefield,’’ Rasor said.

The sources include ‘‘the average
airman who sees a spare part that’s
overpriced to men who sit in the
Secretary of Defense’s office. We
have a very elaborate network of how
to get the documentation to us with
me not having to reveal where it
came from.”’

leaders must ask themselves is ‘Do
we have to be this big to be this
good?’ "Johnson later commented,
“Many companies are simply too
large to be close to their employees
and customers.”’

The dialogue used Japan as an ex
ample of a country whose businesses
place a value on employee-based

management philosophies. Such
philosophies, said the character
Paul, are grounded on the dignity of

the workplace. Employees work in
an atmosphere of teamwork; work

ing conditions are good, and spirit is
high. ‘“‘Consequently, their level of
productivity yields results that can
not be matched by our more ‘results
oriented’ managerial style used in to

Under the pressure of such a
results-oriented system, Johnson
suggested that managers are forced
to hide problems in the company
from the board of directors, decreas-
ing the efficiency of the company and
increasing the pressures on manage-
ment in an already high job-risk
situation.

Another problem, is that of ac-

such accidents occur? Johnson, in a

OPINION

The Ring-tum Phi, November 20, 1986

 

Misbehavin’

Two separate incidents occured last Thursday and Friday
night that reflect poorly on the student body. On Thursday
night several students threw a party in the library. On Friday
night at a ‘‘Laff off’ sponsored by the SAB, several students
heckled one of the comedians to a point where she refused to

continue her performance.

The party in the library Thursday night is simply an abuse
of privileges. W&L students are fortunate to have access to
the library 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The rules of
the library concerning food and drinks, pets and talking are
clearly posted. While it is a breech of regulations, students
sneaking cups of coffee and candy bars into the library seems
more justifiable than throwing a keg party.

These students had to go to great trouble to get the keg and
sneak it into the library. Perhaps the thrill of the ‘‘verboten”
enhanced the party atmosphere (the forbidden fruit is
always the sweetest). Whatever the motivation, it is inex-
cusable. The students who threw that party had no intention
of studying, and probably disturbed those students who
wanted to use the library for what it was intended. Students
have the right (and need, some would argue) to let off steam
by partying, but there are plenty of places to party besides

the library.

The incident Friday night at the G.H.Q. involved a comed-
ian and students. The performers did arrive three hours late,
and by the time they started the show, the audience was fair-
ly rowdy. This group of students yelled obscenities and was
generally obnoxious. It doesn’t matter if the students were
drunk or sober. Their behavior is unacceptable. It is reassur-
ing that some apologized for their fellow students behavior,
explaining that W&L students weren’t usually this bad.

These events are isolated cases, but misbehavior is fre-
quent among the student body. Because these students are
enrolled at Washington and Lee, their behavior is often taken
to be representative of the entire student body. If the library
closes during the early hours of the morning or the SAB can-
not offer certain events, the whole W&L community suffers.
Students’ behavior affects everyone at W&L and students
should thik about the consequences of their actions before
they do something of the spur of the moment.

Not the real thing

 

MY VIEW

Let’s get one thing straight right
now. I am not the voice of a new
generation. I do not wear white se-
quined gloves, and 1 do not sleep
in a high-pressure ‘oxygen chamber
to preservé my beardless complex-
ion. You got it--I’m a Coca-cola
man, always have been and always
will be. When they came out with
that new Coke junk I just knew we
were all going to Hell in a hand-
bag, but thank the good Lord, the
people made their voices heard
and now we all have the Classic
Coke back. A friend of mine told
me recently that when Coke
Classic came back out it was one
of two times in his life that he had
cried. I said I knew what he
meant.

It will come as no surprise to
you then that I’m madder than a
wet hen. What Gerry Darrell has
done is worse than taxation
without representation--they’ve
taken away our Coke!! Not just
from the D-hall or the Co-op, but
everywhere, The nearest Coke is
now at Sweet things or Stop-in.
(Lloyd’s has always been a Pepsi

was just the food.) I don’t know
about you, but at two in the morn-

of my best friends are Pepsi-
drinkers. But I don’t like the stuff,
and I don’t like having it forced
down my throat. Put Pepsi
machines on campus; just leave a
Coke machine too. There’s already
two machines in the D-hall, so
there’s no reason one of them
couldn’t be changed and the other
one left.

Not wanting to jump to any con-
clusions before climbing up onto
my high horse here, I’ve asked all
my friends what they think about
the change-over. I have yet to find
anyone who likes it. I was talking
to Gail in the Co-op today when
they were making the change. She
said that not only did she not like
Pepsi, but she hadn’t met anyone
who did. Now Gail’s a lady who’s
pretty in touch with the student
body since she’s probably fixed a
sandwich for everybody on this
campus at least once, so I’d say
we have a fairly scientific poll go-
ing here. The Student Body is in
agreement that Pepsi hurts and we
don’t wantit.

Mr. Darrell is not dumb. He’s
made the change-over just before we
all go home so that there can’t be too
much protest. But he still may not
know what he’s in for. If we can stage
a sit-in in the President’s office over
something as trivial as coeduca-
tion, just think of what we students
may be moved to do in the face of
something as earth-shattering as
this! I suggest that while you’re
home over the break, you write a
long letter to Mr. Darrell telling
him just how you feel about his
criminal behavior, explaining that
if you had wanted the caffine buzz
of wimps you’d have gone to
Hampton-Squidney—and then you
better go out and buy a few cases
of Coke to bring back to school
and get through exams on.

Senior examines press rights

 

MY VIEW
By Timothy McMahon

 

It never ceases to amaze me how
quickly Thanksgiving vacation ar-
rives, and yet, amid the mad rush of
Fall Term, there always seems to be
something that sparks controversy
(or at least scuttlebutt) along the Col-
onade.

Last year, for example, coeduca-
tion and the question of drunken
disregard for the Honor System
made the headlines. This year, how-
ever, we witnessed a new Fall
wrinkle: the headlines made the
headlines.

We have all heard and read enough
about the Ring-tum Phi, what it has
done wrong, and how its stories
should or should not be presented.
The case of the Interfraternity Coun-
cil and its temporary banning of Phi
reporters was the best-known, but

certainly not the only, such instance.

Looking back at the IFC conflict,
both sides had plausible, if not
justifiable, positions. And now that a
somewhat uneasy calm has returned
to our campus, a few observations
seen warranted.

As a member of a fraternity, I
understand the position that no
fraternity, nor organization charged
with governing the fraternities,
wants bad press. This position could
seem even more understandable
when the vast majority of stories and
editorials about fraternities appear
negative and contain factual:errors.
Further, when said stories are writ-
ten by non-Greeks, the impression
could arise that some sort of anti-
fraternity atmosphere exists in the
press.

But I am also a journalism major
and the News Director for WLUR,
and I feel qualified to look at the
situation from a journalist’s position.

The press at times is, yes, ar-
rogant. We have a responsibility to

inform the public, and we become
defensive when anyone tries to block
our access to information which is
vital to that responsibility, especially
organizations representing more
than 60 percent of the student popula-
tion.

The flipside to this argument is
that responsible reporting means ac-
curate reporting. Inaccuracies,
rightfully, should be prevented to the
greatest extent possible, and not only
through access to information, but

’ through careful scrutiny and presen-

tation of all the relevant facts on any
given issue.

Editorials, meanwhile, should seek.
not just to inflame those who may be
in the wrong; they should be an in-
formed and informative interpreta-
tion of facts. Opinions are vital to
editorials, but they must be fully in-
formed opinions.

We claim the right to express our
many and varied opinions. In claim-
ing this right, however, we must be
responsible to the public. The media,
after all, are not just sources of infor-

mation; they are forums for the ex-
change and interplay of opinions
from journalists and non-journalists
alike.

When inaccuracies do occur, the
press should recognize and correct
them. If a person or organization is
wronged by a story or an editorial,
that person should inform the press
of the inaccuracies, and a correction
should be printed/broadcast stating
the past inaccuracy as wrong and
presenting the correct information.
This should be done immediately to
prevent time from giving the inac-
curacy an air of truth.

Do not get me wrong: I do not con-
done press mistakes. No good jour-
nalist does. What I am saying is that
a free press must be allowed to make
mistakes in the pursuit of truth. That
same free press, however, must cor-
rect any and all mistakes and remain
responsibe to the public it serves.
The first is the right we demand; the

Reader wants more student diversity

 

MY VIEW
By Tom Brickel

 

In reading Dana Bolden’s ‘‘Letter
to the Editor’ last week, I’ve become
convinced that as taboo as the issue
that he raises is, the lack of minority
students, especially of black
students, is a problem Washington
and Lee must address. I use ‘Wash-
ington and Lee’ in the broad sense,
for students and faculty, as well as
administration, play a part in this
problem, for better or for worse. In
the past, it’s been for worse, if one ex-
amines the past relationship between
black and white students. I’m hoping
this is changing, though, and will con-
tinue to improve.

I would like to extend Bolden’s
argument beyond the scope of
blacks, though. Washington and Lee,
in spite of its recent strides in
coeducation, suffers from a lack of
diversity, not only of racial diversity,

granted, but not an altogether false
one.

To The Editor:

 

 

 

Judging from the remains, there must have
been a number of people having a sloshing good
time in the Smoking Study on Lower Level 3 in
the Library on Thursday night. It was no joke on
Friday morning when the Library custodial staf!
had to clean up spilled beer, melting ice, and dog
poop. Do we have to have Library monitors pa-
trolling the building to insure decent behavior?
Or do we have to close the building to insure de-
cent behavior? Or do we have to close the build-

As a result of this homogeneity, at-
titudes have at times been harsh and
condescending toward those of lesser
economic status. Sometimes this has
only been subtly expressed; at other
times, it has been quite apparent.
Last year’s basketball game against
Roanoke College was my first ex-
posure to such attitudes: in an at-
tempt to insult the fans of the oppos-
ing team, students chanted self-
explanatory phrases such as ‘‘wel-
fare’ and ‘“‘food stamps’’ at them,
among other choice verbal descrip-
tions.

Although they evoked laughs, and
many took these to be harmless at-
tempts at demeaning the enemy,
these words are just slightly in-
dicative of pervasive attitudes. And
when millions rely on welfare and
food stamps for daily food and
shelter, I find the taunts just slightly
disturbing.

Obviously, W&L needs to adjust not
only its attitudes toward blacks and
minorities, but also towards those
less blessed with good fortune and
wealth than we are.

Diversity of race and region are
admirable goals, but I wonder if the
character of this school would
change once these alone are achiev-
ed. The admissions office must ask
itself this: instead of striving for
minorities and non-Southerners in
terms of percentages, won't diversity
be better achieved if economic

variance is considered equally worth
the recruitment effort?

The second point on which I would
extend Bolden’s argument regards
his view that the administration must
effect a change in direction in terms
of black admissions. While this is
true, some administrators have tried
extremely hard to bring diversity to
the school, the foremost being Dean
of Minority Affairs Anece McCloud.
Having discussed this problem with
her, I’ve come to respect her im-
mensely for her dedication to the
issue. It would be admirable if more
administrators followed her lead,
though.

But teachers and students play a
major part in changing attitudes and
school policy as well. Pressure ex-
erted by the faculty could play a
significant role in pressing for more
diversity. It would be in their interest
to do so, for being teachers at W&L,
they didn’t come her to publish, cer-
tainly, but rather, to teach. It should
hardly matter to them the back-
ground of the student, so long as he is
motivated to learn. Diversity can
surely be achieved without sacrifice
to academic standards. If that’s the
case, I can’t imagine any teacher op-
posed to diversity.

Students, though, will play a far
more important role, should change
be desired. The administration is
currently in a Catch-22 situation with
regard to its students: prospective

blacks and minorities see a homog-
enous student body, reflecting back-
grounds often very much unlike their
own, and they’re subsequently un-
willing to become entrenched in
them. It would be analogous to an
average W&L student prospecting
Howard University. I believe most
students would feel uncomfortable in
that situation. This is what the Ad-
missions Office has to contend with,
and if students both black and white
realize this and work to be more
receptive to change, prospective
students may pick up on this feeling
on their visits here.

I agree with Bolden that the lack of
minority students is indicative of
neglect by this school, and a signal
for necessary change. It can be
visibly seen in the composition of the
student body, and we haven't even
begun to touch upon the lack of
minority representation in the ad-
ministration and faculty.

But though I share Bolden’s hopes,
I feel diversity on a wider scale
would the more desirable solution.
Historic will be the day when W&L
can claim to have complete religious,
racial, economic, and regional diver-
sity. In the meantime, it would be ad-
mirable if students, teachers, and ad-
ministrators became more sensitive
and responsible to the needs of
the ENTIRE student body. If this
happens, anything will be possible in
our future.

Control policy

The Washington and Lee Department of Student Health
released their birth control policy. It states that “anyone
wanting to go on birth control pills is to see the school
physician for an exam and a pap smear and the physi-
cian will write a prescription for birth control pills. The
exam is free, but the cost of the pap smear, which is
done at Stonewall Jackson Lab, and the prescription of
birth control pills is the responsibility of the individual.”’

Students are also given the option of going to the
Rockbridge Health Department where you receive an ex-
amination, pap smear, counseling and a year’s supply of
birth control pills for $43.00.

Diaphragms are also fitted by the University Physician
at no cost except the cost of the diaphragm, which the in-

Dehydration and dysentery caused
by bad water are the leading killers
of children in Guatemala, according
to Bruce Herrick. Herrick recently
returned from a three week visit to
the Central American nation.

Herrick, the head of the Economics
department at Washington and Lee,
visited Guatemala this summer with
a five member team sent by the U.S.
Agency for International Develop-
ment.

“They're doing as well as they can
with the limited resources they have,
although it’s at a standard far below
that of the United States’, said Her-
rick, describing the Guatemalan
health care system studied by the
team.

Herrick said about one in five
Guatemalan children die before they
reach their first birthday, and the
average life expectancy is 60 years,
compared to 76 years for the United
States.

‘‘Most of the hospitals and doctors
are concentrated in the capital’’, said
Herrick. He added that language bar-
riers, bad roads and a guerilla move-
ment in the mountains have made
good health care difficult.

Bad water, inadequate heating and’
undernourishment contribute to the
poor health of many Guatemalans,
causing upper-respitory diseases
such as bronchitis and pneumonia.

Guatemala has been sporadically
ruled by military juntas for the past
thirty years, but an elected president
took office in 1985. ‘‘I think the army
officers aren’t comfortable with run-
ning the country, the burdens of ad-
ministration are difficult, and
they’re not prepared for them,”’ said
Herrick, explaining the Army’s deci-
sion to hold elections.

“The early 1980s were a time of
grim human rights abuses, and
thousands of people were slaughter-
ed,’ said Herrick. International at-
tention to the situation has lessened
political violence in Guatemala, ac-
cording to Herrick.

Herrick said the new president
recently fired a 600 man internal
security force linked to death-squad
activity, but hasn’t moved to pro-
secute Army officers for previous
crimes. ‘He would lose his office if
he did that,”’ said Herrick.

Looking for
year?

Searching for some super music?

Dying to dance the day — and
the night — away?

If so, then be sure to reserve
Saturday, Feb. 7, for Washington
and Lee University’s ninth annual
Muscular Dystrophy Association
SuperDance,

Beginning at 8 a.m., dancers will
fill W&L’s Pavilion to rock to the
tunes of local favorites Covacus;
Spiedel, Goodrich, & Lille; and the
White Animals. The dancing won’t
stop until 18 hours later, at 2 a.m.
Sunday.

Eighteen hours may seem a long
time to kick up your heels, but
previous SuperDances went on
—and on — for 30 hours. Changing
the length from 30 hours to 18
hours was the idea of Fontanne S.
Bostic, the dance adviser.

The business manager at

the party of the

the

school’s print shop, Bostic attended
the Jerry Lewis Telethon in Las
Vegas, where she talked with other
college dance advisers. Most of
them, she said, have opted for
shorter dances in order to attract
more dancers and thus more
money for the MDA.

And SuperDance is one event in
which money is unabashedly the
name of the game. At the Labor
Day telethon, Bostic presented
Jerry Lewis with a $25,000 check,
making W&L the number one per
capita contributor among the na-
tion’s colleges and _ universities,
said W&L SuperDance Co-Chair-
man Tom Thagard.

“But we want to keep doing bet-
ter,’ Bostic said. Last year, the
dance raised more than $30,000
before expenses. The goal this year
is $34,000, which will be raised
through pledges and spectator
tickets. Fach dancer must have a
minimum of $100 in pledges, and
spectator tickets will cost $10
apiece.

One spectator who won't be pay-
ing is Josh Cross of Blacksburg.

 

Josh is the poster child for the
Roanoke District of MDA. Josh,
who suffers from muscular dys-
trophy, tries to attend all the fund-
raisers for MDA in the District.
His presence at past W&L Super-
Dances has inspired dancers to
hold out for just one more song...
and one more...

W&L’s SuperDance began nine
years ago at the suggestion of the
Roanoke District of MDA. Since
then, the school’s ‘‘Longest Party”’
has grown not only in size but
quality. This year’s dance will of-
fer many prizes, including a trip to
the Virgin Islands for the dancer
with the most pledges and a trip to
Washington, D.C., for the dancer
who collects the most cash. Spec-
tators will be able to participate in
other prize drawings.

Those who wish to dance for

ODAC makes changes Rasor

 

by MIKE SHADY
.ssistant Sports Editor

 

At the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
erence’s twice-yearly meeting this
past Monday and Tuesday, the
athletic directors of the 13 ODAC
schools approved two of the three
Sections of the sports limitations
proposal. But the most highly
debated issue, the elimination of
all out-of-season practices and
direct coaching supervision was tabl-
ed for next year’s spring meeting.

The athletic directors voted 12-1
in favor of the limitation on the
maximum number of contests or
dates each sport can schedule. The
Starting dates for each of the three
sport seasons were also passed by the
following votes: 11-2 for the fall date
of Aug. 20; 13-0 in favor of the winter
date of Oct. 15; anda close 8-5 for the
Spring season date of Feb. 1.

Due to a lack of input by the in-

question regarding out-of-season
practices was postponed. The com-
mittees were supposed to study
how the limitations would affect
their respective sports and then
base recommendations on their
findings. But not enough information
was available for the athletic
directors to make an official final
vote, said Mark Mandel, sports in-
formation director for the ODAC.

The new regulations will be im-
plemented at the beginning of the
fall sports season in 1987-88.

The maximum number of games
or dates for each sport are: foot-
ball — 10 games; soccer — 22;
basketball — 26; cross country —
9; baseball — 30; women’s swim-
ming — 12; lacrosse — 14; tennis
— 30; and track — 10.

Both soccer and tennis were the
only sports in which the number
was changed from the original pro-
posal. Soccer's schedule was orig-
inally set at 18, but was raised to
22, while tennis’ number was bumped
from 20 to 30.

Harriers send three to Nationals

fourth with a time of 27:28, and junior

in the Nationals because they were
the top three finishers who were not
members of the first or second place
teams.

The bitter cold and ice on the
course apparently did not affect the
runners much. Rippeon felt that the
race Saturday was a fast one, W&L’s
three top men each managed to run
their personal bests on W&L’s
demanding 5.1 mile course.

Head coach Dick Miller said that
he was proud of the fact that the team
ran well enough to qualify three men
even though the Generals did not
qualify as a team. The General’s
came within four points of qualifying
nationally as a team.

The Generals finished the regular
season with an impressive 13-3
record. Miller feels that his team ran
up to potential, winning all year with

  

 

Bowls bowled over

News item .... Fiesta Bowl officials have offered both Miami and Penn
State $1.2 million to play for the National Championship on Jan. 2,
1987.

News item .... A Cotton Bowl official termed the deal between the
Fiesta Bowl and the two independent universities “prostitution,” and
claims that the deal is bad for college football.

Who is that guy kidding!? Prostitution? Bad for college football?
Please. The only things hurt by the deal are the major bowls, namely
the Orange, Cotton, Rose, and Sugar. For the first time since the BYU
fiasco the National Championship won’t go to one of the teams par-
ticipating in one of the major bowls, and it’s their own fault.

For years the major bowls have monopolized the college football
bowl scene by offering big bucks to the participants on their bowls.
What’s more, the major bowls also have contracts with the major con-
ferences saying that the winner of a certain conference must compete
in a certain bowl. Generally, all this insures that the major bowls will
get the top teams in the nation to play for them on New Year’s day.

This year, it’s different. The two top tanked teams in the nation
are independents and, as such, are not bound to any bowl. Miami and
Penn State are free, as they are every year, to “‘shop their services’’
and sell themselves to the highest bidder. Obviously, because of their
rankings, their “services” are worth a lot more this year.

So the Fiesta Bowl officials, seeing the opportunity at hand, went to
their sponsers and asked for the extra money that would allow them to
bid for the two top ranked teams in the nation. Then, after the deal had
been made, they decided to move the game to Jan. 2. That nifty piece
of marketing made sure that the battle for the mythical College Foot-
ball National Championship will not have to compete for viewers with
the other bowls, whichare played on New Year's Day:~

The Fiesta Bowl officials, seizing the chance of their collective
lifetimes, have beaten the major bowls at their own game, at least for
one year.

Predictably, the officials of the other bowls are unhappy, Would you
be happy if you had been upstaged so thoroughly? The major bowls ex-
pended a lot of effort in an attempt to make sure that they would have
a stranglehold on the best teams (and consequently the most money)
in the nation. Then, just when they thought that they had every
possibility covered, the Fiesta Bowl, Miami and Penn State barreled
through a huge loophole and upset the pat little world of the major
bowls, in the process earning themselves a lot of money.

What we have seen is an example of the free enterprise system in ac-
tion. A group of businessmen (right or wrong, major college football is
business) thought that they had the market monopolized. Then
another group of businessmen came along and through shrewd
negotiations, quick actions, and a little luck, pulled off a tremendous
coup that yanked the carpet from underneath the monopolists.

Prostitution? Bad for college football? I think not. This year, the two
best teams had the option to play wherever they wanted, and they
availed themselves of the opportunity. What’s wrong with that? This
year, the college football establishment'is going to have to take a
backseat to a previously minor bowl. This year, the Fiesta Bow] is go-
ing to cut into the profits of the major bowls, and this has the officials
of the four major bowls seeing red.

their top four men, and did vei, 5
finishing third out of all the teams
competing in the Regionals. ‘The
team should be proud of themselves
because they do it, I don’t. Cross
country is a self-motivating event,”’
he said.

Miller also believes that the W&L
men continually got better all season,
while it seemed that their opponents
peaked earlier in the season and then
leveled off.

Miller doesn’t want to make
predictions about the National Cham-
pionships on Saturday. He said that
the caliber of some of the other teams
is not known, and the course is un-
familar, but Miller feels that the
three competing W&L men should
represent themselves well.

Washington & Lee’s women’s team

By JIM LAKE
Staff Reporter

 

Despite an excellent passing game,
the Washington and Lee Generals
closed out the 1986 season with their
worst defeat of the year, a 34-point
shutout by the Gators of Allegheny
College. The loss left W&L with a 2-7
overall record, quite a contrast to
last year’s 7-2 campaign.

Offensively, the Generals produced
some statistics that do not in any way
reflect the final score. W&L recorded
14 first downs, only 3 less than
Allegheny. Quarterback Jon Thorn-
ton closed out his career with what
Fallon called ‘‘a really fine day.”

finished their second season with a
3-6 record, and improvement over
last year’s 1-5 record. The women
finished seventh at the South-
Southeast Regionals. Sophomore
Stephanie Smith finished the season
by leading the Generals with a 28th
place finish in a time of 25: 26.

Miller says that the women’s team
has improved vastly over last year.
They competed with nine women this
year and the only time they dropped
any was when two women didn’t
compete at the Regionals. The
freshmen did a great deal to help out
the young women’s team. Miller said
that it will take a while to get the
women’s team used to winning con-
sistently. Jim Phemister from the
law school helped coach the women’s
team and is gradually taking more of
the load from Miller’s shoulders.

The senior completed 17 of 35 passes
for 203 yards and only 1 interception.
Consequently, many of the W&L
receivers had successful afternoons
as well. Three seniors accounted for
most of Thornton’s completions: the
ODAC’s leading receiver, Randy
Brown, caught 6 passes for 83 yards
to lead the Generals, while Bobby
Wilson had 4 receptions for 57 yards
and Paul Youngman hauled in 3
catches for 33 yards.

Unfortunately, the W&L ground
game can best be described as dis-
mal. The tough footing ‘‘seemed to
play against us when we needed it the
most,” according to Fallon. The
Generals netted only five yards
rushing all afternoon, due mostly to 5

Senior Kevin Weaver managed only

The Gators started their scoring

Ray Konopka with 9:37 left in the
first period. In the second quarter,
Gator running back Curtis Brown

ona 16-yard carry, and the Allegheny
lead stood at 14 at the half.

Needless to say, Fallon was sad to
see the 1986 season end with a 34-
point shutout. “‘] felt really bad for
the 16 seniors that (ended their
careers) on a losing note.

But then again I’m really proud of
those seniors, because they went
through a senior year that was rather
difficult for them. They hung in
there, and through their leadership, I
think that, although we didn’t have a
winning season, we did have a good
season, in that our attitude was good
from the start to the end, and I think
we got as much out of our people as
we could possibly expect to.”

 

Let’s talk:

Last week, W&L Athletic Director Bill
McHenry announced that the NCAA had
declared Chris Coffland ineligible for fall sports,
because Coffland is enrolled in only 10 credit
hours for this term. This violates NCAA rule 5-1
c, which specifies that an athlete must be enroll-
ed in 12 credit hours during the semester in
which he participates in athletics. As a punish-

sit out as many as seven games next season, the
number of games in which he played this year.

If the rule is applied in this manner, what ef-
fect does it have on a school with three terms, as
compared to one with two?

Well, first of all, the NCAA is saying that
athletes on a trimester system must take 36
credit «sa year, whereas those on a semester
syste eed take only 24. Just how fair is that?

Furwmermore, this interpretation implies that
students at W&L (or any other school on a 12-12-6
calendar), must take a minimum of 12 credit
hours in each of the three terms to be eligible for
varsity athletics. Now, how many of us are going
to take twelve hours next spring? None! There-
fore, in accordance with the ruling in the Cof-
fland case, all W&L spring athletes who have
competed since the adoption of rule 5-1 c were
(and will be) in violation of NCAA rules, and
should be declared ineligible. According to this
ridiculous and asinine interpretation, all W&L
athletes who participate in lacrosse, baseball,
tennis, and outdoor track after the beginning of
the spring term are in violation of NCAA

ment for.this offense, Coffland may be farced to.

 

OPINION

This stupid manner of enforcement is as baffl-
ing to Generals head football coach Gary Fallon
as it is to everyone else. ‘‘I just can’t understand
the NCAA. I know they have their rules and
guidelines to go by and that they have to enforce
them, but I just don’t think that there’s a whole
lot of common sense being used in their deci-
sion,”’

Fallon points out that most universities re-

 

Hey, NCAA! Now is the time to get your priorities straight

athletes second, whose professors would not
even consider passing a failing athlete to
preserve his eligibility, and whose coaches
wouldn’t even bother to talk to a prospect who
didn’t have high enough SAT scores and grades?
As Fallon said, ‘‘Washington and Lee is not in the
practice of doing anything under the table or
anything unethical. In fact, they’ve got a record
that is just untarnished, and for them to even be

quire an-annual course load-of 24-hours,-or-12.per-....-.put..into.this. light, is.an.embarrassment to the

term, whereas W&L demands a minimum of 27
hours, or 12 in each of the first two terms plus
three in the third. (In Coffland’s case, the faculty
agreed to allow him an underload of 10 hours this
term, with the stipulation that he would enroll in
no fewer than 14 hours during the winter, to bring
his annual total to the required 27.) Clearly, W&L
is not below standard; in fact, Washington and

Lee’s minimum exceeds the national re-
quirements.
Another aspect of this is the idea of

Washington and Lee being accused of wrongdo-
ing. Be serious! We all know that the coaches,
fans, and athletes at many NCAA schools have
been found guilty of gambling, score-fixing,
kickbacks, bribery, and even felonies. The use of
steroids and narcotics is far from rare at many
NCAA schools, Gifts to athletes by alumni and
fans, bogus courses, and sub-moronic admission
and grading standards for athletes are reported
regularly.

With violations of this magnitude going on,
why does the NCAA punish a school whose
academic standards are among the highest in

whole institution.”’

The fact that the NCAA would make an exam-
ple of Coffland is in itself amazing. ‘“‘There’s no
question” but that Coffland is one of the most
devoted athletes at W&L, according to Fallon.
It’s so meaningful for him to be able to play foot-
ball,” says Fallon. ‘Because he’s not a pro pro-
spect, (Coffland knows that) he only has one
more year of football, and he certainly wants it
to be a year without any events like this in front
of him.”

The point of all of this is simple: NCAA, get
your priorities straight! Empower various com-
mittees to interpret the rules as they see fit, and
let them decide when an athlete isn’t making
progress towards his degree. And go after
legitimate, serious violations, not petty ones.
When there are clear violations’ act quickly and
forcefully, so that there will never be another
Len Bias. And give Chris Coffland his eligibility
back, immediately. A devoted student-athlete,
his team, and his university have suffered a
severe injustice; don’t do any more damage, and
don’t let this happen to anyone, anywhere, ever

Washington and Lee ranks high
among the 550 educational institu-
tions around the United States for
providing leading business ex-
ecutives.

In 1985 The Financial and Ecnomic
Information Company in conjunction
with Standard and Poor’s released
their ‘Executive College Sur-
vey’’which listed the number of
leading business executives coming
from each edcucational institution. A
leading business executive is defined
as presidents, vice presidents and
directors of companies. No other
demographic data was included in
the survey, according toa release put
out by the company.

“The present study represents an
effort to provide an accurate ranking
of the institutions in the “Ex-
ecutive/College Survey’ based on
the ratio of their business leaders
with undergraduate degrees and
average numbers of bachelor’s
degrees presented yearly. This ratio
will provide a more realistic and

statistically sound method of assess-
ing an institution’s contribution to the
business community than provided
by the Poor’s Register (which did not
account for the size of an institu-
tion).”’

The business-to-graduate ratio was
found by dividing the number of ex-
ecutives listed in the 1985 survey by
the average number of bachelors
degrees presented between the
1972-73 and the 1982-83 academic
years for each institution. The center
for Education Statistics has no data
prior to 1972.

W&L ranks eighth in the survey,
directly following M.1.T. and directly
preceeding California Institute of
Technology and Cornell University.

The Virginia Military Institute, the
only state school on the list ranks 23
and Hampden-Sydney College ranks
52; no other Virginia college or
university was ranked in the top 56
schools.

In the 1985 survey, W&L is ranked
fourth among private, four-year, pri-
marily undergraduate institutions
with undergraduate enrollment less
than 3,000.

Pseudo student
arrested for theft

 

By ABB JONES
Staff Reporter

 

Ending a crime spree that ap-
parently lasted for almost three
months, the Lexington police depart-

|.ment recently apprehended a
suspect. On Decemeber 17, Perry

Hayes, 19, of Lexington, was ap-
prehended for questioning and subse-
quently arrested on charges of Grand
and Petty Larceny, regarding the
thefts of belongings of numerous
Washington and Lee
undergraduates. Wallets, cassette
tape players, cassette tapes, cash,
clothing, binoculars, and pen and
pencil sets were among the items
confiscated by officers following
Hayes’ arrest.

According to arresting officer
Lieutenant Bruce Beard, Hayes now
faces four charges of larceny;
several other charges are still pen-
ding. The police first became aware
of the connection between Hayes and
the thefts after receiving matching
descriptions from students. Beard
said that he believed the reason
Hayes escaped detection for so long
was that he ‘‘appeared like a fellow
student,” and was therefore largely
unnoticed on campus.

Hayes apparently had been living
on-campus during the time the
crimes were committed; several
students spotted him sleeping in the
library, Reid Hall, and the dormitory
lounges, and eating in the dining hall,
where he apparently had presented
himself as a freshman. One person
who noticed Hayes frequently in the
Reid Hall library was sophomore
Mike Shady, who said, ‘‘When I first
met him, I knew something was sus-
picious.”

Head Dormitory Counselor Jeff
Mandak said he first became sus-
picious of Hayes’ presence in the
dorms when he discovered Hayes
sleeping in the Graham-Lees Dor-

mitory television lounge. Mandak
claimed that upon asking Hayes if he
was a student at Washington and
Lee, Hayes replied that he was atten-
ding the university on the GI bill, a
program by which the federal gov-
ernment funds the combined educa-
tion of those who attend college after
leaving the armed forces:

Two weeks later, during Fall Term
exam week, Mandak discovered that
one of the freshmen residing on his
hall had let Hayes move into his
room. When a sudden increase in
thefts appeared in the dorms, Man-
dak and another dorm counselor, Jay
Gorlowski, inquired with the reg-
istrar about Hayes.

Hayes claimed he was just waiting
for Dean Huntley to get him a room.
Mandak and Gorlowski, upon visiting
the room Hayes was occupying, dis-
covered such items as ROTC equip-
ment, stereo equipment, cassette
tape players, cassette tapes, and
clothing, in addition to others.

Mandak alerted University Proc-
tor Charles ‘Murph’ Murray, who,
along with Beard, questioned Hayes,
and after his arrest, confiscated the
merchandise. According to Mandak,
prior to the arrival of the police,
several students, upon learning the
whereabouts of the stolen belongings,
reclaimed them before the police
reclaimed them from the room.

Hayes will be arraigned on
January 27, ‘‘to allow all of the
students who were prosecuting to be
present,” according to Beard. At this
time, Hayes and attorney David Nat-
kins will enter his plea of either
“guilty” or ‘‘not guilty.”’

Lieutenant Beard and Proctor
Murray have both noted that many of
the stolen articles have yet to be
claimed, and they have encouraged
all persons who have noticed missing
articles since late September to con-
tact the Lexington Police depart-
ment.

Washington and Lee, which is
among the nation’s ‘‘choosiest col-
leges,”’ according to a survey
released by USA Today, is enjoy-
ing a record-setting year in ad-
missions for the class of 1991.

One month before the final
deadline for application, the W&L
admissions office has received
more than 2,662 applications.
William Hartog, director of ad-
missions, expects to receive in ex-
cess of 3,000 applications by the
February 1 deadline for the 410
freshman places.

Last year the admissions office
received a total of 2,417 applica-
tions, 222 applications less than
the record-setting 2,639 applica-
tions received during the 1985-86
academic year.

It was data from the 1985-86
academic year that was used by
USA Today in its survey. In the
report, released December 15,
W&L ranked 23rd among the na-
tion’s colleges and universities
that accepted less than half of the

 

 

USA Today says W&L ‘choosy’

applicants and had and average
freshman SAT score of 1200 out of
1600.

W&L accepted 33.6 percent of
the 2,639 students who applied for
admission to the class of 1989, the
first class in which women were
enrolled at W&L as undergrad-
uates. W&L was also the second
least expensive private institution
included in the survey.

W&L’s appeal to seniors is also
reflected in the number of
students who have applied for ear-
ly admission. The admissions of-
fice received 301 applications
from 30 states and two foreign
countries for early decision, a 40
percent increase over last year.
For the class of 1989, the admis-
sions office received 210 applica-
tions for early decision.

“We are doing well in admis-
sions because our current
students are positive about all
aspects about the education of-
fered here,” Hartog said. ‘“‘There
is a direct correlation between the
popularity of the school and the
experiences of its current

WéLranked 8th in national survey

students.”

Hartog pointed to the high
percentage of students who re-
main at W&L after freshman year
as an indication of the school’s
popularity with students. Accord-
ing to Scott Dittman, university
registrar, 392 freshmen of last
year’s class of 410 returned for
their sophomore year at W&L, a
retention rate of 96 percent.

“IT tie it to the favorable ex-
periences of the coeducated
classes,’ Hartog said. “The high
retention rate says to counselors,
parents and students that ‘Coedu-
cation is working at Washington
and Lee.’ ”

In addition to the large increase
in the number of applications, the
admissions office has interviewed
more students on campus this
year than ever before. Through
December 1 the admissions office
had interviewed 1,470 high school
students. That compares with
1,170 during the same period last
academic year and 981 interviews
for the first coed undergraduate
class.

Concert nets huge loss

 

By VALERIE PIERSON
Staff Reporter

 

At the Executive Committee
meeting Monday night, Student Ac-
tivities Board treasurer Greg Knapp
reported that the Spinners concert
resulted in a net loss of $17,000. Poor
student participation was cited as the
primary reason for this loss.

Executive Director Sean Coyle
stated that the SAB selected the best
band available for the weekend.
However, he explained that in a
previous appearance at W&L, the
Spinners only played for a short

a...ount of time. As a result, Coyle
believes many upperclassmen were
not interested in seeing them per-
form again .or fear of another short
concert.

Jay Markley, also a member of the
SAB, said that the SAB has sponsored
two of its best concerts recently, and
student turnout has been minimal.
He stated, ‘‘We’ve had fantastic con-
certs, and nobody has come.”’

Markley added that more promo-
tion and better publicity might be
possible solutions for successful con-
certs in the future. He explained that
it is difficult to obtain the more well-

     

known bands because most of the
time the SAB has to work with just
one date, and available bands are
very limited.

SAB Chairman Glynn Alexander
told the EC that he is considering
several options in planning any
future concerts. Included among
these would be to attract more
popular bands which would appeal to
more people. These bands would cost
more, so there would be fewer con-
certs.

At the request of the EC, the SAB
will re-evaluate its financial situation
and submit a revised budget next
week for approval by the EC.

from a 2.640 to a 2.682. Both indepen-
dent and fraternity GPA’s were
higher this year.

The GPA for fraternity members
this term was 2.582 as compared to
2.572 last year; comparitively, the in-
dependent GPA rose from a 2.766 toa
2.865. The seniors led the class GPA
with 2.873. Next were the non-degree
students with 2.859; sophomores,
2.699; juniors, 2.627; and freshmen
2.569. The seniors decreased from
last year’s 2.913 while all other
classes increased.

Of the thirty three GPA’s equalling
or exceeding 4.0, seventeen were

OPINION
Big names

At Monday’s E.C. meeting the SAB reported a $17,000 loss
from the Christmas concert featuring the Spinners. SAB
Chairman Glynn Alexander explained that the SAB has two
choices in scheduling concerts. It could schedule smaller
name bands that cost approximately $8,000, attract smaller
crowds and lose about $3,000 per concert. The other alter-
native is to engage more well-known bands costing roughly
$30,000 each, pack the pavilion and lose $12,000 per concert. It
is a choice of having many small concerts or a few big ones.

In this case, the old cliche that bigger is better holds true. It
is better to bring ‘‘big name” bands to just a few concerts
that the majority of the university will attend, than many
sparsely attended concerts.

“Bigger name”’ concerts will benefit students is by pro-
viding a chance to see these bands in a beiMing smaller than
an arena or civic center. The pavilion may be crowded when
filled to capacity, but it is still possible to see members of the
band, rather than just dots on a stage.

There is a drawback in that students will inevitably pay
more for tickets after standing in longer lines. However, both
the prices and the lines will probably be smaller than they
would be for the same groups when they appear off-campus.

The SAB should take the suggestion of Sophomore EC Re-
presentative Christopher De Movellan and schedule concerts
for weekends that aren’t big fraternity weekends. This would
liven up some weekends during which everyone laments
“There’s nothing to do!” Scheduling concerts for usually

magenta weekends would probably increase ticket sales as

The SAB expects to take a loss when it puts on a concert.
However, it seems reasonable to expect the receipts of a con-
cert to cover at least half of the costs. Fewer concerts featur-
ing bigger name groups will hopefully ensure that the SAB
doesn’t suffer a loss similar to the one incurred from the re-
cent Christmas Concert.

Be aware

The recent arrest of a young man who had been living in

and allegedly stealing from the dorms is enough to give dorm

residents insomnia. This person managed to live for three
months, sleeping in the library and dorms and eating in the
dining hall, before being detected. How could this have hap-
pened? Are the residents really so blind or involved in classes
or extracurricular activities not to notice a strange man
hanging out in the dorms?

A few months ago, another man roamed around Baker Dor-
mitory. One woman resident saw him coming out of another
resident’s open unoccupied room. The student called security
who came and removed the man who was trespassing. The
scary aspéct of the whole incident was that the man had
browsed the resident’s room long enough to learn the
resident’s name. It appears he had been through the dorms
on several seperate occasions.

Our Honor System, allowing W&L students so much
freedom, also has the unfortunate effect of leaving us quite
vulnerable to those outside of the system. Dorm rooms are
regularly left unlocked, and doors are often left standing
open with valuables in plain sight. Students seeing a strange
person in the dorms often assume the best and suspect the un-
familiar person is a pizza delivery person, one of the workers
from the Gaines Hall construction site in search of a soft
drink machine, or perhaps some out-of-town visitor in search
of a resident.

Security could be increased in an attempt to take care of
this problem. Perhaps students should carry a pass key to get
into the dorms, or show their student i.d. to a guard at the
door, but attempts to solve the problem create greater pro-
blems of their own. Students at universities that use such
systems often end up with many students locked out of their
dorms. This is very likely a greater hassle than it’s worth.

W&L security may be somewhat limited in manpower, but
they do an exceptional job. There is always someone at the
switchboard. A security officer arrives promptly, even when
it is only to open a locked door.

The only way to prevent persons not of the W&L communi-
ty from taking advantage of students is for students
themselves to become more conscious of stragers around the
dorms. If someone is behaving suspiciously, call security.
From the recent arrest of the young man who was allegedly
stealing from the dorms, we must all realize it’s better to be
safe than sorry.

LETTERS

W&L coed reacts to Smith’s stereotyping

To The Editors:

Paul Smith’s My View that ran under the
headline ‘‘Coeds are not liberal”’ in the last edi-
tion of the Phi should be a lesson to us all on the
evils of the dreaded stereotype. Mr. Smith seems
to be quite an authority, if only self-proclaimed,
on the typical W&L student and particularly on
the typical W&L coed, I find the latter claim par-
ticularly interesting considering the fact that
none of the twenty or so coeds with whom I
discussed Mr. Smith’s opinion in the two days
after it was published had ever heard of him,
much less met him. I confess I am interested in
meeting the person who knows so much about
my psyche and those of my female classmates
that he is able to assert that we are ‘‘insecure,”
“characterized by a burning desire to succeed”’
and motivated ‘‘not so much by a passion to
learn as by (our) ambitions to compete alongside
(our) male counterpart(s)”’.

This characterization is so insulting that it
almost does not warrant response. Who is Mr.
Smith to pronounce our motives unfit or even to
pronounce them at all? Any woman who came to
W&L to ‘‘prove”’ herself would undoubtedly be
unhappy as she would be anywhere else. She
would be an immature and poorly-adjusted in-
dividual. In general I find W&L women, and I
seem to know more of them than Mr. Smith does,
very well adjusted to the academically stimu-
lating environment that some people seem to
forget was academically stimulating before
coeducation.

I resent being stereotyped. I was taught the
fallacy of stereotypes in an eighth grade class. A
group of women as small and diverse as the
women at W&L cannot be stereotyped with any
accuracy, especially if one does not even know
them.

In addition, Mr. Smith stereotypes the typical
W&L student whose ‘“‘life is one big bow] of cher-
ries’. He decries an environment in which ‘‘the
greater issues of our day never get debated, the
bigger questions...never get asked.” Although I
will grant that many students at W&L are privi-
leged enough not to have to worry about financial
considerations, I do not believe that financial
security breeds moral unawareness. College is
not the real world: it is the training ground upon
which, one hopes we acquire the skills to allow us
to improve the state of our world after we leave
college. I, too, wish that certain segments of the
W&L community were less apathetic but pro-
jects such as Superdance and the Mock Conven-
tion not to mention our student government and
the honor system could not succeed without the
student support that they receive. In proportion
to the size of our student body, I would be willing
to bet that W&L students are more active in ex-
tracurricular activities than the students at most
other universities.

As far as the record after college is concerned,
the accomplishments of a long line of distin-
guished alumni stand in contrast to Mr. Smith’s
implication that material wealth is the only goal
of the typical W&L alum. I would hope that the
average alumnus of W&L is distinguished above
the average graduate of many colleges. Ethics is
a very important part of any education, and
ethical considerations arise in many classes out-
side of the Religion and Philosophy departments.

Finally, Mr. Smith ends with what I would
label a call to arms, a cry for action. Does he
want every W&L student to sign 5 petitions this
term? A much more realistic approach to im-
proving the world’s problems is to study the
situation in college and after joining the ‘real
world” to try to have an impact on the issue(s)
concerned. Results may not be immediate, but
actions, not words, solve problems. Decrying the
“hideous price-fixing schemes by our own book-
store’ in the same breath as ‘immoral decisions
by our Board of Trustees” is not going to im-
prove anything.

In addition, Mr. Smith is premature in judging
the impact of the Class of 1989 on the university.
The success of coeducation has been largely a
measure of the willingness of the students and
faculty to assimilate women and of the will-
ingness of W&L women to be assimilated. No
doubt the University would not have benefitted
from the addition of a bunch of militant ‘‘liberal”
women, I know that many women in my class
consider themselves liberal, as do many men,
and it is their perogative to doso.

Sometimes the best change is gradual change
through the status quo. At least give us four
years, not one, before judging us. A university is
not a static institution — it reflects the composi-
tion of its student body which is not always what
it appears to be at first glance. W&L will pro-
bably never be stereotyed as a “‘liberal’’ univer-

sity, but neither should it be stereotyped as Mr.
Smith has characterized it.

Darrell comments on Coke

To The Editor:

In spite of the information published in the Phi
there still seems to be some confusion about the
availability of canned Coca Cola on campus.
There are Coke machines located across cam-
pus; in the Warner Center, Parmly Hall and the
University Theater. In addition, I had written in-
to our agreement with the Pepsi Cola Company
that if I determined there is sufficient demand to
warrant it, we have the option of placing Classic
Coke in a couple of Pepsi machines on campus.
Classic Coke is now available, in addition to the
three locations aforementioned, in the Pepsi
= located in Reid Hall and Washington

Finally, I would like to clarify one of my
remarks as reported by Tom Brickel (Cola
Change 12/4) regarding the number of com-
plaints I had been receiving about vending
machines: What I said was, ‘By far and away, I
receive more complaints about malfunctioning
vending machines than I do about the food in all
three of our campus food service locations, com-
bined”’,

Easter Day travel criticized

To The Editor:

I don’t know if most of the student body is
aware yet, but the last day of our April break
falls on Easter Sunday. I don’t think the decision
to end break on that particular Sunday was made
with evil intentions on the part of the administra-
tion, but I am dissatisfied with the situation
nonetheless.

First, Easter Sunday is undeniably an impor-
tant religious holiday. An opportunity to worship
or observe Easter should not be restricted by the
time limitations imposed by the necessity of
returning to Lexington.

From personal experience, I believe Easter to
be a time when families and friends gather
together and visit, a sometimes infrequent op-

portunity.

Also, on holidays the frequency of plane flights
and rail and bus trips are generally reduced.
Transportation might pose a great hardship to
some members of the geographically diverse
student body.

What do we do about this issue? The most ob-
vious answer is to press the administration to
start Spring Term on that Tuesday. If anyone
else has any ideas on this matter it would be a
good idea to voice them now, before it is too late.

United Way drive successful

To The Editur

Your readers may have learned by now that
the Lexington-Rockbridge United Way met its
goal, by raising $111,292. At Washington & Lee
we not only met, but surpassed our goal of $21,500
by raising $23,029. Many individual volunteers on
campus made a special effort this year in help-
ing us reach our goal. On behalf of those who are
recipients of the generosity of the W&L com-
munity, we thank you. It does work — the United

Way!

Christmas tree appreciated

To the editors:

The Christmas tree in the lobby of the University
Library and the lights in the trees along the en-
trance plaza were much enjoyed and apprecia-
ted by the faculty and students according to com-
ments passed along to the library staff.

I would like to thank Alpha Phi Omega, and
specifically Douglas Harvey, Doug Turrell and
John Wiltse from that group, for the hours they
spent in searching for, chopping down and bring-
ing in the tree as well as hanging the lights. It is

such a pleasure to work with students who enjoy
contributing to the whole of the University com-
munity.

Sincerely,

Senior laments destruction

To The Editor:

Recently a great deal of damage has been done
to the University owned lot on Nelson St. This is
the open ground behind fraternities on Washing-
ton St. The damage has been incurred by the
habit of driving over that ground for parking, to
turn around, for fun and to go from the top of the
hill to the bottom. Unfortunately there is no road
there. Unfortunately our students care less for
the property of others, which our tuition bills
maintain, than they do for their own cars.

Strangely, rather than expend effort to im-
prove the situation, the University has remained
blind, even unaware of the problem. We see con-
stant reminders of the University’s efforts to
control the student body and shape them in the
nice sort of W&L boys everyone wants to know.
This is most apparant in the school’s efforts to
curb student chemical use. We are barraged
with committees on drinking, and warnings
about drugs. Fraternities are repeatedly urged
to discourage drinking, to have parties only on
days allowed by the school, not to have beer in
kegs, and even to close their parties entirely.

Yet despite the harping about the morality of
drugs, the effort to make the student acceptable
and the effort to maintain some vague moral
standard, the school does not seem interested in
the hard fact of destruction of its property. A
close look will show that this sort of nonsense
goes on wether it is a sanctioned party night or
not. A closer look shows that student chemical
consumption, parties and personal life cannot be
enforced even by the Cheka, KGB and CIA to-
gether. A clear headed look suggests that the
school should cease trying to inject others with
its own strain of moral virus and look to protec-
ting its own property. Respect for private and
community property is a public matter and it
might be a lesson worth teaching. It might also
be enforcible.

Klank’s view irks students

To Whom it may Concern:

Bob Dylan once wrote: “I can see that your
head has been twisted and fed by worthless foam
from the mouth.” Mr. Klank’s self-righteous
view of public affection has captured the essence
of ‘‘worthless foam.’’ His article stated, ‘“‘At an
institution of higher learning, one would think
that the learning process would be the student’s
primary concern.”’ We find it quite ironic that
Mr. Klank’s “primary concern’’ seems to be
catching people in the act of being human rather
than using his time to reap the benefits of this in-
stitution. It is sad to hear that a person could be
so offended by human emotion, especially if he
lets himself be so offended by continuing to
watch closely and long enough to notice “french
style tongue kissing.” We cannot deny that
public displays of affection exist on campus, but
we have never been offended as though we had
some foggy notion of nineteenth century morali-
ty. We think that Mr. Klank should spend his
time worrying about and concentrating on his
education, which he says he is here for, and not
about harmless displays of emotion. If Mr. Klank
“knows pitiful rednecks who have more class”
perhaps he should be among them.

Take one of those little
Christmas candy canes, stick the
straight end ina pencil sharpener,
and crank that baby a few times.
Your finished product will resem-
ble one of Milton Colvin’s letters
to the Phi — short, sweet and to-
the-point.

Okay, so maybe that was a
weak attempt, but it’s true. In the
past few years, Colvin has laid
down class rules in the Phi. He’s
told us that the only time a lady
can chew gum and remain a lady
is on an airplane.

And on October 23, the 62-year-
old politics professor and foreign
policy expert dipped his candy
cane into a little Tabasco. ‘‘Why
doesn’t the Student Government
get the Students to pick up the lit-
ter; or buy a large playpen?” he
wrote.

At that time, party-related
trash had become a serious pro-
blem at Washington and Lee.
Even Brian Shaw, whose job it is
to bear good tidings from W&L to
the news media, mentioned that
on certain Sunday mornings, the
town looked like a junkyard
because of fraternal overin-
dulgence.

Throughout the fall term, trash
even became common on campus.
Just before break, I remember
picking my way past shattered
glass and empty beer cans around
the freshman dorms. Surely, it

LEXICON

By Steve Pockrass

‘Tabasco tainted candy spear’

must’ve been the dreaded yeast-
and-hops fairy who dropped them
there, as beer isn’t allowed in the
quads under any circumstances.

In an interview just after his let-
ter was printed, Colvin had harsh
words for some students, calling
them ‘‘spoiled brats.’ He stressed
that it was not the majority of the
students who were trashing the
community, but those who did
were making a most unfavorable
impression in the community.

A second-generation W&L pro-
fessor and a Zeta Psi fraternity of-
ficer while a student at Yale, Col-
vin said the W&L campus had
changed in his years here. House
mothers are almost non-existent.
Few seniors live in the frat
houses. And there is a seeming
lack of pride or sense of decorum
among the fraternities, he said,
especially when they thoughtless-
ly ruin their own property.

“T think that my generation was
the Depression generation. We
can’t understand the destruction
of property,” Colvin said. ‘“‘And
the idea that you can pay for it is
no excuse.”

The drinking situation seems to
have changed, too, said Colvin,
who’s been teaching at W&L for 25
years. Just as a lady knows when
to chew her gum, a gentleman
knows how to hold his liquor. He
drinks and may even get drunk,
but he knows his limit. And cer-

tainly, a gentleman remembers
that as a guest, even if he’s
trashing himself, that doesn’t
given him a right to trash his com-
munity.

In an interview this week, Col-
vin said the trash problem had im-
proved. Perhaps he made an ef-
fective stab with his Tabasco-
tainted candy spear, although it
may have been that just as Rush
tapered, so did the frat money.

Personally, I’ve never been a
king of neatness. Many people can
attest to that. But I’ve never pitch-
ed my milk cartons in the street,
either, and many people can at-
test to that, too.

Keeping our community clean is
a problem we all must address.
The answer is not a new guideline
in the Interfraternity Council
bylaws requiring all frat mem-
bers to use personally engraved
mugs so we can trace the culprits.
It’s not a guideline requiring that
all beer mugs be tied with string
to the front doors of our frat
houses so we can pull them back
in after we pass out on the front
lawns, in the street, on the traffic
medians, or wherever.

The answer is for us — we, who
often refer to our campus as one of
the nation’s most beautiful —
police ourselves. That would be a
mighty fine New Year’s resolu-
tion.

 

 

Senior gets sentimental,
looks ahead to bright future

MY VIEW

By Chris Carter

 

Living in Oklahoma and going to
school in Virginia, like most anything
I suppose, has its advantages and
disadvantages. On the minus side
there’s the twenty hour drive which
has the market on tedium completely
cornered. On the plus side there’s a
series of great rock stations along I-
40 that I always enjoy tuning into (in
the lingo of the 80’s ‘‘re’’ generation,
their music is referred to as
“classic” rock, but we all remember
what Billy Joel said about such
musical fads). With the long drive, I
can catch up really quickly on what
the nation is listening to. Even this
generally enjoyable attempt of mak-
ing the best of it has its problems,
however, since inevitably a song
that’s really great when you first
hear it in Little Rock is intolerable by
the time you get to Bristol. The worst
drive ever was when ‘‘Let’s Hear It
for the Boy”’ was setting the country
on fire — I thought we’d never get to
Oklahoma!
All the above is a rather round-
about way of getting around to what
will be a reflective piece by an overly
sentimental senior who realized
while he was at home over break that
he probably won’t spend so much
time (just two weeks?) at home
again for a long time — if ever. One
' of the big songs on the radio right
+ now is Bruce Hornsby’s piece with
_ the lines, “Some things never

change/That’s just the way it is.’’ No

doubt Hu. asby is right, especially in
the context of his song, but as I
thought about the fact that I’ve less
than six months left here in Lex-
ington, his words were just the op-
posite of what I had been thinking.

They call it Reality Shock. Facing
the Real World. After four years of
parties and term papers, all nighters
and Fall Weekends, it’s time to hit
the daily grind of commuting and car
payments. Or else. it’s three or. four
more years of study.:— but this time it
really counts. Whether it’s torts or
cadaviers, keg parties and all-night
B.S. sessions go out the window.
What Christmas Break? If you’re
lucky you get Christmas Eve off. The
closest you may get to Mom and Dad
is a pushbutton phone.

So much for Senior fears. There’s
bound to be life after commence-
ment, but I suspect there’s several
like me who are some-what skeptical
of the whole affair. Except that what
senior isn’t also just dying to get out?
Things have already changed too
much in the last four years. When
you go home and find that your mom
now stores her out of season dresses
in your closet and that you can’t open
your dresser because your brother
has hidden your Christmas present in
there — that’s where I used to hide
his — you've already realized that
Home isn’t what it used to be. When
you rediscover curfews and family
schedules (I do laundry on Tues-
days!), you wonder if you want it to
be. Things may be changing more
than you thought, Bruce.

It’s not just at home though. Things
have changed here on campus as
well. I don’t mean things like
coeducation or the Honor System (for

an excellent essay along these lines I
heartily recommend Dr. Coulling’s
introduction to the new W&L Photo
Album); I’m talking about more per-
sonal things. Everything from get-
ting just a little bit bored with the old
party scene to wanting something a
little permanent in the way of one’s
love life to being really tired of hav-
ing to ask Dad for money. A large
number of your friends have grad-
uated and, all ofa sudden you find
that half the people you hang out with
don’t share your memories of
freshman and sophomore years.
They talk in psychology about some
stimuli which cause an ap-
proach/avoidance conflict. Welcome
to independence.

Some things don’t change — like
seniors who start getting sentimental
about graduating. W&L_hasn’t
changed that much; on the nine-
teenth of this month everybody will
gather in the Chapel for Founder’s
Day the way they have been doing
since the 1870’s. But I’ll bet the
seniors there will think just a little
sadly about how much things have
changed in the last four years while
wishing it didn’t have to be over so
soon. And then we'll all get over it
and go about our business, interview-
ing, applying, and not being able to
wait to get out, and generally making
plans for all kinds of changes. And I
realized this also when I was listen-
ing to the radio on I-40. One of the
other songs I heard expresses the
perfect counterpoint to Bruce Horn-
sby — Timbuk 3 sings “‘The future’s
so bright, I gotta wear shades.’’ One
of the things I’d been intending to do
with some of my Christmas money
was buy a new pair of sunglasses — I
think I'll get extra dark.

Naw York racism appalls student

 

MY VIEW
By Tom Brickel

 

Reality in this world continues to
amaze me. Events from Rio de
Janiero to Peking leave me dumb-
founded, for as open-minded and ‘‘ex-
perienced” as I try to convince
myself I am, so many things will jar
me in the course of ten pages of
newsprint. My astonishment runs the
gamut from natural disasters and
starvation, to terrorist tactics (one
must credit terrorists — the skill and
bravery which it takes to kill unarm-
ed, innocent citizens is unsurpassed
in this age of vanishing heroes).

However, when events meriting
considerable negative media atten-
tion occur in one’s own backyard,
cursory glances no longer suffice.
Disbelief and shock reign, and the
event’s stranglehold on a community
may last well beyond election
coverage.

Howard Beach, in New York City,
is no exception.

This community, nestled in Queens
near one of the country’s largest air-
ports, has been synonymous over the
past two weeks with hatred, racism,
and photo opportunities. The New
York Daily News, a terrible news-
paper in its own right, has been one of

many New York papers getting the
most out of coverage of the event in
which a black man was killed by a
car in an attempt to escape the
beatings of white youths.

I imagine coverage was limited in
other parts of the country, but that
would not diminish the tragedy, and
significance, of what transpired.
Michael Griffith was one of several
black men who had the misfortune of
eating pizza in a hostile white
neighborhood after their car broke
down- Upon leaving the pizzeria, the
men were set upon by a motley gang
of white teenagers who, armed with
baseball bats and sticks, chose to
creatively express their racism by
beating the men.

Griffith ran away, but due to the ef-
forts of his attackers to continue their
game, he escaped through a hole in a
fence and ran onto the Belt Parkway,
one of New York’s finest highways.
He was hit by a car and killed.

While time may reveal a connec-
tion between the highway accident
itself and the events which preceded
it, the beatings cannot be taken out of
context. Horrible in themselves, they
resulted in a murder. Ironically,
Griffith's death may not have been in
vain, for coverage given to the
beatings would have been extremely
curtailed had they not resulted in a
death.

Defenses for the three youths
charged with manslaughter rose to
the occasion. One defense placed | the

blame on the community of Howard
Beach. Howard Beach, being 98%
white (why does this percentage
seem familiar?), and harboring
some ill will towards non-whites, was
responsible for the beatings, and not
the youth, who was most certainly a
victim in his own right. Showing a
passing knowledge of current affairs,
the lawyer also suggested that the
defendant’s actions were influenced
by his South African ancestry.

A scarier defense was given for
another defendant: it proposed that
the black men were looking for trou-
ble when their car broke down in a
white neighborhood (this defendant,
incidentally, was alleged to have
stated in the pizzeria, “Let’s go kill
the niggers.” He later explained that
the term “‘kill’’ was meant loosely, in
spite of Griffith’s strict interpreta-
tion).

The community of Howard Beach,
as well as neighboring communities,
will probably spend much time ex-
amining themselves, for their local
media will not let the issue rest in the
near future. Time will not remove the
shock of the event, an event so close
to home when compared with remote
murders and stabbings in distant
boroughs and countries. It is a shame
that it takes a given proximity before
people truly feel the tragedy of tragic
events, whether caused by nature, or
by other men.

Howard Beach is reeling from the
_blow.. as should we all. a

PE requirements called excessive

 

MY VIEW
By Abb Jones

Well, so begins another year,
another school term, and yet another
opportunity to ponder why Washing-
ton and Lee requires each student to
take five physical education courses
(the total of which equals one whole
credit) in order to graduate. I mean,
other schools don’t require 5 P.E.’s to
obtain a degree. (Not that we would
want to be like other colleges and
universities, but isn’t this a tad bit
excessive?) I am fully aware of the
fact that W&L is a college of liberal
arts, meaning graduates are ex-
pected to be educationally well-
rounded, having been exposed (at
least minimally) to science, math,
social sciences, art, and literature. I
can only assume that by having
students exposed to five P.E.
courses, they will have as much well-
roundedness physically as they do
educationally, even if it means tak-

ing everything from cross-country
running, golf, and soccer, to canoe-
ing, basketball, and handball. Fine,
but isn’t requiring five pushing it?
W&L students already have a multi-
tude of requirements to worry about.
Why not ease up and require only,
say, three. (Sounds pretty good to
me.)

This first idea I propose is simple.
Less course requirements in P.E.
would lighten the load for everyone,
students and P.E. teachers (who
could concentrate more on the varsi-
ty team sports), without causing ir-
reparable damage to the physical
well-being of the student body. (I
seriously doubt that having two less
P.E.’s is going to cause the downfall
of the university.)

Second, why not allow students to
repeat some of the courses they en-
joy, rather than force them to choose
courses in which their only interest is
getting a big ‘“P’’ on their report
cards. I know this may go against the
well-rounded student theory, but why
not allow a student to become profi-
cient in one sport, rather than merely

 

 

 

 

 

familiar with five? I’m not proposing
that all P.E. courses should be
repeated, just the ‘‘lifetime sports”’,
such as running, swimming, golf,
tennis, weight lifting, and racquet-
ball. (It would be ridiculous to allow
someone to repeat a course such as
water life-saving once they’ve passed
it and become certified lifeguards).

Finally, why not allow students the
option of taking P.E. courses through
independent study, whereby they
would pledge on their honor to devote
a specified amount of time each week
to the sport of their choice? This
would allow students to fit physical
education into their schedules, rather
than vice versa. This would also
allow (or require, however you may
see it) students to cultivate self-
discipline, which is a pretty essential
part of growing up. Furthermore, I
believe this would, in addition to eas-
ing up on the burden of five P.E.
courses, allow and possibly en-
courage students to choose one sport
and perhaps become more proficient
at it than just being present during
five other courses.

Atkins cites frat ‘charade’

By SAMUEL FOLEY
Staff Reporter

 

In its last meeting before the
Christmas break the Intra-fraternity
Council ratified the bylaws to its con-
stitution. This ratification is subject
to the approval of the Student Ac-
tivities Committee, but the IFC
President Chris Saxman said he saw
no reason why the bylaws should not
be adopted and at the IFC’s meeting
Tuesday night he urged the frater-
nities to begin to operate under them,

The ratification process went
smoothly through the first ten bylaws
until bylaw eleven was reached. This
section deals with the “Rules for
Regulation of Fraternity Social
Functions”. This was the main point
of the dispute in the meeting and is
took over two hours for the bylaw to
be amended and passed.

The source of the conflict in bylaw
XI was how much control will be ex-
ercised over the individual frater-
nities in regards to their social ac-

LaRue enjoys government position

By CHRIS MUNSEY
Staff Reporter

 

“There are some things I put off
thinking about. Like sewage treat-
ment. It’s not high on my list,”’ says
Susan LaRue, who has served on the
Lexington City Council for six years.

LaRue first ran for city council in
1978, placing fourth in a field of eight
candidates. She ran again in 1980 and
was elected, after visiting hundreds
of local voters. ‘‘I saw a lot of people,
and I think people started to say, hey,
she’s serious about this. I was the on-
y choice people had for a change.”’

LaRue said she ran for office
yecause local politicians weren’t
»aying attention to issues such as the
2qual Rights Amendment. ‘I decid-
xd maybe the problem was there
vere no woman politicians in local
sovernment. I wanted to vote.”’

LaRue said she enjoys par-
icipating in local government for
everal reasons. “It’s fun to know
vhat’s going on, and saying some-
hing about an issue you feel is im-

portant.’’ Local government, accord-
ing to LaRue, does have some nega-
tive aspects.

“The scary part is having a vote
you know so little about. I don’t like
voting that makes people angry and
unhappy, against people I know and
like,” said LaRue, adding that hiring
and firing employees also bothers
her.

“Sometimes you just don’t know
the right answer.’’ LaRue thinks
some problems in the community
have not been met by the city council.

“You miss issues, don’t ask impor-
tant questions that should be asked,
because of a lack of time, lack of
knowledge, and lack of input from
other people,’’ said LaRue.

“Some days I’m sorry I’m there.
You get bored and don’t think it
makes much difference, but you have
to keep a sense of humor.”

The meetings of the different com-
mittees LaRue isan mber of usual-
ly demand one and sometimes three
evenings a week. ‘‘That’s why I like
the fifth week of the month, because

there aren’t any meetings,” said
LaRue.

LaRue has worked at the Washing-
ton and Lee bookstore for four years,
and is responsible for ordering the
general interest books. ‘‘Blood and
guts sell the most, and war and
humor books,’ said LaRue. The
bookstore sold $75,000 worth of
general interest books last year, and
LaRue says she orders the books bas-
ed on reviews and student requests.

“It’s fun to look at small presses
and out of the way academic titles. I
usually have in mind someone who
might buy the book. There’s all sorts
of interesting titles stashed away on
the shelves,’’ says LaRue, adding
that she tries to maintain the tradi-
tional intellectual seriousness of the
bookstore. ‘‘When we have our mid-
night madness sales, I’m really
pleased at the way students buy good
intellectual stuff.’’

LaRue grew up in Washington,
D.C., and majored in zoology at Duke

University, graduating in 1962. She
met her future husband Lewis on a
blind date. Lewis LaRue graduated
from W&L in 1959, and went on to
study law at the Harvard Law
School. ‘‘I thought he was going to be
a hotshot Washington lawyer, but we
moved to Lexington in 1967 when he
got an offer to teach at the law
school,” said LaRue.

“The town has gotten spiffier,
especially since they placed the elec-
tric wires underground on Main St.
The city has to develop tourism,’’
LaRue said. “‘The main problems in
the city are size and money. Our
taxes don’t go far enough, and the
school system gets less money than it
really deserves.’’

LaRue says similar types of
students go to W&L every year.
“There’s a consistent politeness
about students here, students willing
to be patient. I think they develop a
good deal of self-confidence and han-
dle life in a congenial, competent

W&L introduces a new summer program

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Assignments Editor

 

Some Washington and Lee students
and their parents may be attending
school together this June at W&L’s
rewest summer program, a family
dusiness institute.

The purpose of the institute is to
1elp family members learn about the
special problems associated with
‘unning a family business, according
0 Robert Fure, a director of summer
yrograms at W&L.

“The issues that dominate the life
of family-held corporations are not
itrictly financial,’’ Fure said.
‘Family business is woven through
vith many sociological and psycho-

available in the Dean of Students’ Of-
fice, which is in Payne Hall.

Re-application forms from current

Topics to be examined at W&L’s
first annual Institute for Family

members, competing demands of
home and family, transfer of owner-

be accepted from rising sophomores,
juniors and seniors, and only from
law students who currently are dorm
counselors. This likely will be the last
year that applications are accepted
from rising sophomore men or
women.

Huntley said the decision not to let
other law students apply was made
“simply because of the time de-
mand.”’ He said rising sophomores
would not be allowed to apply after
this year because there would be
enough women in the junior and
senior classes to sustain the pro-
gram.

“It isn’t that they haven’t worked
out,” he said.

Two national authorities on family
business will serve as adjunct pro-
fessors on the institute staff. Barbara
Hollander is a senior fellow in the
Program for Women in Family Busi-
ness at the Wharton School Office of
Executive Education. John L. Ward,
author of ‘Keeping the Family
Business Healthy,” is the Ralph

Fure said that the institute would
include a number of forums and that
the W&L staff expected to learn a lot
from the participants. From the in-
stitute, the school may develop a
regular-term course dealing solely
with family businesses.

Fure said W&L was starting its
program to serve a public need. As
many as 3,000 of W&L’s 15,000 alum-
ni, or 20 percent, are directly involv-
ed in family business, he said.

The institute is scheduled for June
28 - July 2. Enrollment is not limited
to alumni and will be first-come,

Superdance shooting for $34,000

 

By TOM BRICKEL
ftaff Reporter

Experiment is the unofficial theme
for this year’s Superdance, accord-
ng to its chairmen, James Barker
and Tom Thagard.

Barker, a senior and past worker
on the Superdance’s special events
zommittee, and Thagard, senior and
‘raternity coordinator the past two
years, refer to the recent change in
che dance’s format.

This is the first year since the
jance’s inception at Washington and
ee that the dance has been shorten-
2d. Previously 30 hours, several fac-
ors influenced their decision to
shorten the dance to 18 hours.

“The impetus for the change in-
tially came when Fontanne (Fon-
anne Bostic, Superdance advisor)
raveled to Las Vegas to present last
vear’s check to Jerry Lewis on the
MDA Telethon. While there, she had
he opportunity to speak with
‘epresentatives from other muscular
lystrophy Superdances,’’ said
Sarker.

- “Basically,” he added, “she learn-
d that shorter superdances at other

 

schools were as successful in bring-
ing in pledge money as the longer
superdances were, if not more suc-
cessful.”’

The result of this change should be
a more compact, exciting Super-
dance, according to Thagard.

“In the past, the length of the
dance meant that we had to hire two
big bands to attract people for Friday
and Saturday nights. This year, we
will have the money to not only hire
bigger and better bands, but we'll be
able to keep them playing for almost
the entire 18 hours. There will be
very few lulls in the dance this year,”
Thagard continued.

Covacus and the White Animals
are two of the many bands scheduled
to play this year.

Attrition has been another major
problem in past Superdances. ‘‘Get-
ting dancers to remain on the dance
floor for the scheduled 30 hours was
difficult, and many dancers would
leave before or after the break. Some
didn’t even come back until the
Saturday night band played,” said
Debi Hurtt, female coordinator for
the Superdance and a dancer last
year.

The shortened dance length will

have perhaps it greatest effect on the
amount of pledge money brought in.
Thagard and Barker pointed out that
in order to keep pace with the
amounts raised in past dances, a
large turnout will be necessary.

‘“‘We hope to double the number of
dancers which we had participate
last year which was about 160,’ com-
mented Barker. ‘‘Because that dance
was 39 hours, it had the opportunity
to make money from people who
came to watch the Friday night band.
It is an opportunity we lack this year,
but hopefully, with a large turnout,
plus attendance from the bands
througout the day, we'll be able to
equal, if not surpass, last year’s total
of $30,000,”’ he said.

The goal for this year is $34,000,
Thagard added.

As great as that goal may seem,
Barker and Thagard feel that it can
be reached. The W&L Superdance
last year was one of the country’s top
money earners per capita among the
nation’s schools for the Muscular
Dystrophy Association. And with
prizes such as a trip to the Virgin
Islands, this year’s Superdance pro-
mises to be the biggest ever. But this
depends on school participation

The topic of O’Donnel’s lecture is
“The Agony and the Ecstasy — De-
signer Drugs.’’ The lecture is open to
the public.

The lecture is being co-sponsored
by the Alcohol and Health Awareness
Committee at Washington and Lee
and the Mountain Wood Treatment
Center. For further information call

tivities. Many representatives
thought that the n>w bylaws were too
restrictive and interfered too much
in what they felt whould be their own
business.

On the other side of the issue was
Dean Buddy Atkins who supports the
restrictions on fraternity social
events. ‘‘The obligation of a specific
fraternity is to get as many people as
possible to stay in Lexington and
study. What the hell do you want to
do, party five days a week?” he ask-
ed the representatives, ‘“You’ve been
playing this stupid charade for
years,”

Many of the representatives saw
the final version of the bylaws as a
compromise or new and even stricter
regulations would be forced on them
by the school. Pi Kappa Phi Presi-
dent Jimmy Holmes said, “If we
didn’t accept these (bylaws) some-
thing worse would be forced on us by
the school. It was only a matter of
time. I think it will force us to be
more responsible.”

The new bylaws contain many new
mandatory ‘Guidelines for Safe
Partying.’’ Some of these guidelines
are: have a sober officer in charge of
the event, admit only members and
invited guests, collect car keys from
intoxicated people and designate
sober drivers to provide transporta-
tion for anyone who becomes intox-
icated.

Both Dean Atkins and Saxman said
that if all the houses adhere to these

guidelines they will become like sec
ond nature and seem less retrictive

The bylaws stress that all fraterni-
ty parties must now be closed with
only members, their dates and in-
vited guests allowed to attend.

In addition fraternities will be fore-
ed to register their social events with
the Council Social Chairman no later
than mid-day the day before the
event.

Police Chief Beard appeared at
Tuesday’s IFC meeting to discuss
some new procedures involving noise
permits.

Beard said that a new permit form
will be used stating the name of the
person in the house that is responsi-
ble for the event. In addition an
Amplified Sound Card would be given
to that person to be posted on the
front door of a house so that if an of-
ficer has come to that house he knows
who to ask for. Beard said this would
help solve the problem of officers just
entering a house without first asking
for a person in charge.

Atkins said that this new system
would make enforcement more con-
sistent and help the houses and the
police.

Before Beard left the meeting he
said, ‘‘I want you to know we are not
here to harass you. I am willing to
meet you more than halfway.”’

Saxman also annouced that 81 per-
cent of the men in the freshman class
pledged a fraternity this year.

30 companies to
interview oncampus

By JOHN PENSEC
News Editor

 

With only five months until gradua-
tion, seniors who have not already
done so, are beginning to enter the
search for post-graduate employ-
ment. To help them in their endea-
vors, the Office of Career Develop-
ment and Placement has scheduled
30 banks and corporations to inter-
view on the Washington and Lee
campus between January 8 and April
7. The process differs from previous
years in that a bidding system is be-
ing used for the first time, a system
designed to give a student ‘personal
control over the sign up for on-
campus recruiting and to assure ab-
solute fairness,’ according to a
release from the career office.

According to the bidding system
each senior is given 400 points with
which they can make their bids for
individual organizations. Each
organization has a limited number of
interview slots and those students
turning in the highest bids will be
allotted a chance to sign up for an in-

terview. In the case of a tie, a lottery
will be held, and there will be waiting
lists for each organization. .uon.

There are a number of meetings
designed to orient seniors to the bid-
ding system and attendance is man-
datory for any senior planning on
participating in the recruitment pro-
cess. The meetings will be held on-
Friday January 9 at 4 p.m., Monday,
January 12 at 5 p.m. and Friday,
January 16 at4p.m.

In addition to the bidding system,
the career office has scheduled a
series of workshops during the
Winter term similar to those offered
during the Fall. These workshops are
open to all students. On January 13 at
4 p.m. Shannon W. McFayden. Assis-
tant Vice President and Manager of
College Relations for First Union
Corporation will speak on interview-
ing and job search techniques

Trey Mamo, '84 will speak on
January 16 at 3 p.m. on Information-
New York Investment and Commer-
cial banks. Both Mamo and McFay-
den will speak in Room 114 of the
University Center.

zenerals win at the buzzer

y MIKE SHADY
ssistant Sports Editor

 

Call him ‘‘Mr, Clutch. :

With six seconds remaining,
ophomore Lee Brading grabbed the
asketball and decided to take mat-
‘rs into his own hands, Brading
'eaved his way through traffic on
1e left wing and from two feet
ehind the three-point line pulled up
nd released the basketball in that
ear perfect Spalding Guide form.
he shot nicked the rim as it settled
1 the net and it gave the Washington
nd Lee basketball team a thrilling
1-68 victory over Cortland State
‘uesday night in the Warner Center.

“I wasn’t sure how much time was
“ft when I got the ball,” said
irading. ‘‘We were running out of
ime, and I had to get it off.”

Brading scored the General’s final
even points in a game that started
ut looking like a junior high school
lame and not at all like Division III
ollege basketball. The first half was
narred with sloppy play as both
eams appeared rusty after the
‘hristmas holidays. The General’s
vere particularly cold from the out-
ide, shooting only 35% from the
ield. Cortland State fared better
rom the floor with a 48% clip but lost
nany scoring opportunities by turn-
ng the ball over an alarming 13

times. A late scoring run at the close
of the half provided Cortland State
witha slim halftime lead, 32-29.

W&L was faced with two problems
at the onset of the contest, both of
which were a result of the team’s
vacation trip to Europe. One was the
overall condition or stamina of the
players. W&L’s solution was to
substitute frequently throughout the
entire game.

“We were not in the shape we
hoped to be in after the trip,” said
head coach Verne Canfield. ‘‘We are
a little weary from all our traveling.”

The other problem was what Can-
field referred to as ‘a family mat-
ter.” Three General starters, senior
Rob Spencer, and juniors Harmon
Harden and Steve Hancock, watched
the game from the bench in street
clothes.

“Three people were not able to
play so we had to go with odd lineups
all night,” he said.

Canfield was specifically talking
about the lineup he put on the floor
for the stretch drive. W&L went with
senior Jefferson Harralson, who led
all scorers with 20 points, as the lone
big man and put Brading, sophomore
Manny Klump, freshmen Wes Boyd,
and senior Fred Bissinger around the
perimeter. ‘‘Shooters,”’ Canfield
said, ‘They were simply outside
shooters.”

Too many questions

Last Friday undefeated Miami and undefeated Penn State squared
off in a matchup of the first and second ranked college football teams
in the nation. The game was, without a doubt, one of the most exciting
in recent memory. Imagine, the National Title coming down to one
play. You couldn’t have written a better scenario.

Wouldn’t it be just as good to end every season with an all-or-nothing
game just like this year’s Fiesta Bowl? Wouldn’t you like to see a Na-
tional Championship Playoff system for Division I Football?

Well, I think a National playoff system is a good idea. It’s just the
narticulars of the proposal that bother me. What would happen to the
Bowls? How would you pick which teams would participate in the
playoffs? How would the extra games affect the players and coaches?

iirst, what would happen to the Bowls? The bow! system has given a
lot to college football over the years. It has generated huge amounts of
excitement (not to mention huge amounts of revenue) for the sport.
Naturally, when someone comes up with a good thing (in this case the
bowls) other people pick up the idea. Hence, the 18 bowl games we
have today. Since I don’t think that it would be right to discontinue the
bow! system cold turkey, how would we include the Bowls in a playoff
system? Would it be fair to give all the Bowls (the newer bowls and the
New Year’s Day Bowls alike) an equal chance to host the National Ti-
tle Game? Would it be fair not to? How do we include all 18 bowls
anyway? If 16 teams are invited to the playoffs, that still leaves two
bow! games out in the cold. Which bowls then would be annointed for
survival by the NCAA? How would they decide fairly?

Second, how would you pick the teams to participate in the playoffs?
For that matter, how many teams could you invite? This isn’t like the
NCAA Basketball Tournament, you couldn’t invite everybody with a
winning record. Would you give automatic bids to certain conference
champions? Wouldn’t that perpetuate the bias towards the large
southern football factories? If that were the case, what about the
smaller schools and conferences, and what happens to the in-
dependents like Miami of Penn State? Would these teams be
systematically excluded from the Playoffs? If you use the wire service
rankings to decide who gets a tournament bid, isn’t that just as ar-
bitrary as the present system? Which wire service ranking would you
use? As it stands, the team with the best record generally wins the Na-
tional Title. In a playoff system, would the teams with the best records
get tournament invitations? What incentive is there then to play a dif-
ficult regular season schedule? What would stop Oklahoma (or any
team for that matter) from playing a schedule of Division 1-AA
schools to pad their record and assure themselves of a tournament
bid?

Third, what effect would the extra games have on the players and
coaches? These aren’t professional football players (for the most
part) that were dealing with here. How would the extra games affect
the players mentally? Traditionally a bowl game has been a reward
for a good season, would the playoffs become the object of the season?
With the playoff system, the teams will be forced to play extra games,
which means extra expenses, which means extra money must pe
given to the praticipating teams. The idea of even more cash cir-
culating around Division I Football makes me uneasy, but I suppose
Division I Basketball has been able to handle the extra money, there’s
no reason to think that Division I Football wouldn’t be able to control
the extra cash.

Maybe now you can understand my dilemma. I like the idea of a
playoff system to decide the National Title, but there are a lot of
details to work out yet. Maybe someday, someone will solve all the
problems and I would feel better about the whole idea. Until then
however, I can’t answer even half the questions that occur to me when
I start to consider a playoff system.

 

 

The Generals fell behind,
58-46,with 11:42 left in the second
half. But a 13-1 spurt over the next
five minutes erased the deficit and
knotted the score at 59 with 6:12 re-
maining. W&L was playing excellent
basketball at both ends of the floor.

“Offensively we slowed down,”
said Canfield, ‘‘Before we were
rushing. We put the people in the
areas (on the court) where we
wanted them to be in.

“I’m so proud of them that they
didn’t quit and kept pecking away
This was a game in which everybody
contributed.”’

With under 45 seconds left to play
and the score deadlocked at 67, Cort-
land State sent Klump to the line for
the one-and-one. Klump missed the
front-end and Cortland State had its
chance to either win the game or
send it into overtime. However, with
head coach Bill Williams instructing
his team to hold for the final shot,
Mark Wainright inexplicably decided
to take on three General defenders
and crashed into Brading for an of-
fensive foul. Brading hit one of two
from the line so W&L led briefly
68-67.

After Wainwright’s stupidity, the
General’s returned the favor when-
with six seconds showing on the
clock, Bissinger fouled Harry Barr in
the act of shooting. Barr could

the stage for Brading’s game-ending

“I thought (the shot) was going

It sure did go right. Right into the

Hoopsters travel, get a taste of ‘euroball’

By JIM LAKE
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee basket-
ball team travelled to Europe over
the Christmas holidays to play teams
in Belgium, the Netherlands, and
Luxembourg. The Generals were 1-2
on the trip, including a win over
Sportlife of Amsterdam and losses to
Mercurius of Antwerp and A.B. Con-
tern of Luxembourg.

The first game of the series started
with an excellent first period, but the
Generals fell apart in the second half,

according to head coach Verne Can-
field. Senior Jefferson Harralson and
junior Harmon Harden were the
leading scorers for W&L in a 91-72
loss to Mercurius.

In their second game, the Generals
blew out Sportlife, 101-67. Sophmore
Lee Brading and Harden both had 14
points in that game, and both Har-
ralson and junior Steve Hancock had
12 each.

The final game of the trip was the
only close one, a narrow 72-70 loss to
A.B. Cotern, a team with one profes-
sional player who led all scorers with
30 points. Harralson scored 23
points to lead the Generals. Sopho-

Grapplers hope to be

healthy for weekend
quadrangular meet

 

By MATHEW HORRIDGE
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee wrestling
team hopes to be healthy enough to
turn its season around this Saturday
in a quadrangular meet in the
Warner Center.

“We hope everyone will be back”’
to wrestle, head coach Gary Franke
said yesterday.

Five wrestlers did not wrestle in
the Generals’ last match — a 33-17
loss to Virginia Tech on Dec. 10
—because of injuries. Sophomore
Mark Robertson will undergo

surgery to correct his injured knee
and will not compete for the rest of
the season, Franke said.

Franke said he was not sure
whether or not junior Dan Fales or
sophomore Richard Redfoot would
be able to compete this weekend.

Last weekend, three Generals
— seniors John Lowe and Tim
Walker and sophomore George
Loupassi — wrestled in the Maryland
Open. Walker was the most suc-

* cessful of the three, winning three of

his five matches.

The Generals will face Johns
Hopkins, Loyola and Hampden-
Sydney in the meet Saturday. Match-
es start at noon.

Van Son and Gareis

named to All-South
soccer team

 

From Staff Reports

Two players from the Washington
and Lee men’s soccer team were
named by the National Soccer
Coaches Association to the All-South
Team,

Senior forward Peter Van Son of
Lloyd Harbor, N.Y. made the first
team while junior goalie Chris Gareis
of Atlanta garnered second team
honors.

“I am very proud for both of

them,’’ said head coach Rolf Pira-
nian. ‘‘They had outstanding seasons
and really deserve this prestigious
honor.”’

Van Son scored five goals during
the season, two of which were game
winners. Garcis had three shutouts
en route to establishing a school
record for career shutouts and allow-
ed just 14 goals. Both players were
key performers for the Generals as
W&L captured its first Old Dominion
Athletic Conference title.

more Manny Klump has 13 points and
junior Lou Trosch added 10.

All three games were piayed under
international rules, which create a
much more fast paced game than
American rules. For example, when
an offensive violation occurs, the
team which gains possesion can put
the ball into play immediately; the
clock continues to run, and the of-
ficials do not touch the ball. Also,
goal tending is rarely called, and this
rule, said Canfield, created a real
problem for the Generals against
A.B. Contern, whose big men blocked
several General shots after the ball
was already on the way down.

But basketball, according to Can-
field, was only a secondary reason
for the trip. The primary goal uf the
trip, said Canfield, was to provide an
educational experience for his
players. ‘‘I would want to go even if
we didn’t play a single game,” he
said.

Canfield, who is in his 23rd season
at W&L, is already planning a return
trip in 1990 and hopes that the Univer-
sity will consider awarding academic
credit to the students who par-
ticipate.

The games.do not count towards
the General’s regular season record.

A ‘Little Shop’ of suprises!

 

By MICHAEL TUGGLE
Movie Critic

* x x x Excellent-Don't miss it

* * O.K.-Good for Study Breaks

* Bad-Better Things to Do

BOMB A waste of Time and Money.

“Little Shop of Horrors" is one of
the most enjoyable movie: musicals
and certainly one of the finest Broad-
way adaptions to come to the big
screen in years. It combines solid
performances with exceptional spe-
cial effects and a plethora of musical
numbers that will excite you and put
a smile on your face.

The show opens in Mushnik’s Skid
Row Florist shop where Mushnik
(Vincent Gardinia) announces to his
two employees, Seymour (Rick
Moranis) and Audrey (Ellen
Greene), that due to poor business he
is closing the shop. In desperation,

Audrey suggests that ‘putting that
strange and interesting plant that
Seymour has been working on in the
window might attract customers.”
Strangely enough, when Seymour
puts the ‘‘Audrey II" (in honor of his
secret crush on Audrey) in the win-
dow, customers start pouring in.

As the three attempt to leave for a
celebration dinner that evening, the
“Audrey II'' droops in Seymour's
hands. With visions of losing his sud-
den wealth, Mushnik confines
Seymour to the shop to care for the
ailing plant. While trying to discover
the cause of the plant's sickness,
Seymour pricks his finger on a thorn.
Suddenly the “Audrey II" stands up
and attempts to suck his finger. As
Seymour moves his finger closer to
the plant, the ‘‘Audrey II’ snaps at
his finger as if to bite it off. To do
what he thinks will save the plant,
Seymour squeezes a few drops of
blood into the plants mouth and begs
it to grow.

Grow it does! The cannabalistic
“Audrey II" continues to grow until
it grows larger than Seymour himself
with total transformation climaxing

as the ‘‘Audrey II" begins to speak.
From here on the film takes twists
and turns involving Seymour's crush
on Audrey, her relationship with
boyfriend Orin Scrivello, the sadistic
dentist, and the ‘Audrey II's’ true
origin that dead end in an explosion
of music and laughter at the end of
the film.

‘Little Shop of Horrors’’ has a
multitude of solid performances that
complement each other well. Rick
Moranis’ performance as Seymour is
reminiscent of the ‘‘Ghostbusters”’
role that propelled him to comedic
stardom. His relationships with
Audrey and the ‘‘Audrey II"’ are both
humerous and touching in a ‘‘sappy
Broadway kinda way,"’ once again
demonstrating that Moranis is one of
the funniest, most talented actors in
film today.

Ellen Greene’s dizzy blonde por-
trayal of Audrey is the finest perfor-
mance in the film. Her airhead
delivery and brassy singing voice
bring the same electricity to her
screen role that enabled her to steal
the show in the off-Broadway
original. Steve Martin is hilarious as

the demented dentist while Bill Mur-
ray, John Candy and Jim Belushi
provide cameo appearances that are
quite funny, In addition, Tichna Ar-
nold, Michelle Weeks, and Tisha
Campbell are wonderful as a
‘‘Supremes’’-style background
chorus that repeatedly appears at
dramatic moments in the film.

Perhaps the most important
member of the cast is never seen.
Levi Stubbs of the original ‘Four
Tops’ provides the voice for the
‘Audrey II’’ and makes the monster
mound of singing foliage a character
you'll be quoting and humming after
as you leave the theater.

From an overall perspective, ‘‘Lit-
tle Shop of Horrors” is in its own
right one of the year’s best. Good
casting, riveting performances by
the characters, a wonderful 50s-60s
doo-wop score, and exciting, realistic
special effects make this film a fun
experience and a possible sleeper for
the Oscars this spring. If you enjoy
Broadway musicals or music in
general, then don’t miss “Little Shop
of Horrors.”

Critic choses ten best records of year

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Entertainment Editor

 

This was the year the Monkees
became famous. Again.

This was also the year that Madon-
na, like any other good Catholic girl,
quit talking about her virginity and
started worrying about getting preg-
nant. Boston released a record that
took longer to record than it took
Thomas Pynchon to write all 820
pages of Gravity’s Rainbow. Janet
Jackson convinced everyone that she
wasn't fat, Duran Duran almost
dwindled down to nothing (a bit of
wishful thinking? ), and Dweezil Zap-
pa became a household name.

But there have been worse years.
Honest.

Amid all of this stupidity—and
stupid was certainly the key word for
this year of Space Shuttle disasters
and Irangates—there were some
very good records released. Honest.

In fact, The Ring-tum Phi has
chosen the 10 best pop records of the
year—some you might have heard,
others you might have had no idea
even existed. Nonetheless, they are
all out there, begging to be bought.

Before we unveil the list, a few
things must be cleared up. Bruce
Springsteen's ‘‘Spruce Goose’’ did
not make it since all of the per-
formers listed put in a bit of work this
year. Sitting behind a digital remix
board for a couple of weeks hardly
counts as a major acheivement.
Sorry Bruce. Also, sales had nothing
to do with the selection.

The number ten album of the year
belongs to the Lucy Show. Their sec-
ond effort, called ‘‘Mania,”’ is almost,
as perfect a pop record as one could
find. Great melodies, tight playing,

  
  
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
     

and exquisite production by producer
John Leckie make this one of the
year’s best. Watch for this one to
make some waves in the coming
months.

Husker Du’s major label debut,
“Candy Apple Grey,” certainly
wasn't their best, but it was easily
one of the best record of the year. The
Woodentops get the eighth best
release with ‘‘Giant’’ a kinetic, ex-
uberant showcase of pop smarts and
good feelings. Lead singer Rollo Gen-
try is on the verge of becoming a -
star. Mark those words.

Coming in at number seven is
R.E.M., with “Life’s Rich Pageant.”’
Don Gehman, John Cougar Mellen-
camp’s producer, gives this record
an AOR punch that would lead on to
scream ‘‘Sell out!”’ if it weren’t for
the fact that the songs were so damn
good. (Ironically enough, this record
contains ‘“‘Superman,”’ R.E.M.’s big-
gest hit so far and a song that was
probably intended as a B-side. But
what with the Monkees and all...)

Easterhouse-a five man English
group-released a stunning debut
record of strident politics and teeth-
grinding rock n’ roll called
“Contenders.”’ Not since the Gang of
Four has a band mixed socialism and
pop music this well. Their music is a
cross between Joy Division and Big
Country; their lyrics fall somewhere
between Das Kapital and the Clash,

The Smiths get the number five
album with “The Queen is Dead.”
Ten songs about the monarchy,
poetry, loneliness, big mouths,
transvestite vicars and love make
this an interesting journey. So far,
this is the Smith’s best yet.

Coming in at number four is XTC
with their brand new Ip, ‘“Skylark-
ing.” Some of the songs on this

breath-taking record are truly
sublime—all the others are simply
wonderful. This lush, pastoral record
is this group’s eighth release. A hun-
dred years from now, historians arc
going to look back on popular culture
in the 80s and wonder why XTC
weren't hugely successful.

Paul Simon's ‘Graceland’ comes
in at number three. Everything about
this record is beautiful: the music,
the lyrics, the production. Hey, even
the record cover is pretty sharp. Paul
Simon continues to be the John Up-
dike of pop music, putting us keenly
in touch with out society and our-
selves, and doing it beautifully and
tastefully.

Peter Case’s first solo effort was
almost the best record of the year.
Great songs, great singing and great
playing — it’s all here. Case’s fusion
of blues, folk, Beatle-esque pop and
flat-out rock n’ roll is stunning: it is
like listening to a paradigm of
popular music. Pick this one up if you
ever see it.

And the best record of the year? No
doubt about it, the Church’s ‘Hey
Day” takes top honors. This is
joyous, uplifting music, lush, power-

Kimbrough dies
after long illness

By MARGARET PIMBLETT
Staff Reporter

 

A memorial service for Professor
Emory Kimbrough Jr., the chairman
of the Washington and Lee sociology
department, will be held in Lee
Chapel at 4:30 p.m. on Friday. Kim-
brough died Thursday, January 8, at
his brother’s home in Clarksville,
Tennessee. He was 52 years old.

A native of Clarksville, Kimbrough
received his A.B. degree in sociology
from Davidson College, and his M.A.
and Ph.D. degrees from the Universi-
ty of North Carolina. He was a
member of Phi Beta Kappa and the
Alpha Tau Omega social fraternity.

Kimbrough joined the Washington
and Lee faculty in 1962 as an instruc-
tor of sociology, and was promoted to
associate professor in 1966. He
achieved the rank of professor in

1969. Kimbrough was named depart-
ment chairman in 1967 and held that
position until his death. Kimbrough’s
courses included general sociology,
American social institutions, the ci-
ty, population, social theory, current
issues in sociology, and organization
theory.

Professor of Accounting Jay D.
Cook; who has taught at W&L since
1953, said, “My wife and I treated
Emory like family, since he wasn’t
married. We traveled with him to
visit family and to see Europe. He
was very close to our two sons.
Emory was a very honorable man,
but was a very private person. He
was difficult to know well, but we
knew him so long we discovered
many things about him.”

Phi business manager relieved of

SSS eS

Greg Turley, business manager of
the Ring-tum Phi was relieved of his
duties at a special meeting of the
Publications Board Wednesday
afternoon.

The board made its decision after a
discussion of his bookkeeping, ac-
counting and sales practices for the
paper. The meeting was called
following the Executive Committee
meeting Monday night, at which the
Phi's budget report was met with
questions and comments from the
E.C.

Senior Representative Andrew
Caruthers said the ideal ratio should
be 60 percent advertising and 40 per-
cent news copy in the paper, but that
in the last issue, it was more like ten
or 15 percent advertising. ‘‘How can
you afford to put out a paper?” he
said, sey answered that the previous
week’s low advertising ‘‘was based
on, for one thing, one of my advertis-
ing salesmen isn’t working anymore.
Another thing is that it was a slow
week, and we were pressed for
time.”’

He continued, ‘You can look at

some of the other papers during the
year, you can see we've had lots of
advertisements. We’ve had _ the
advertisements to run eight pages,
but haven’t had the news to fill eight
pages.”

Ring-tum Phi Editor Sean Bugg
said last night, ‘‘I can remember one
or two issues earlier in the year when

we.didn’t have enough copy for the .

ads which were sold, but we have had
three or five issues recently when we
had to hold copy because not enough
ads were sold to pay for an eight-
page paper.”’

Caruthers also questioned the
check deposit procedures of the Phi.
Turley said that a deposit had been
made earlier Monday by News
Editor John Pensec. According to
Pensec, ‘I deposited over $2,000
worth of checks. Before break, there
were about $500 worth of checks in
the Ring-tum Phi office.”’

Pensec’s deposit was for $2311.50,

Vice-President Brandt Surgner
said that he had looked over the Phi’s
ledger, in which checks are recorded.
He said, ‘‘We were shaking our heads
because it wasn’t at all up to date. I’d
never seen books kept that way in my
life.”

The billing procedures for local

advertisers was questioned by
Caruthers, who recommended that
the Phi use tear sheets for organiza-
tions and businesses in Lexington. He
said a number of businesses already
owe the Phi money. “‘That’s not just
one week’s issue. Why haven’t they
been sent tear sheets and why
haven’t they paid their bills? You’ve
got $1200 that should be collecting in-
terest. You’re $4000 in the hole right
now. At $667 an issue, it looks like
spring term isn’t coming out.”

Last night after the Publications
Board meeting, Turley said, “I
thought I was doing a good job in
relation to the situation I had at the
beginning of the year, with outstand-
ing bills (from the 1985-86 academic
year) that needed to be collected,
outstanding revenue that needed to
be paid, no money in the treasury,
and no ads salesmen back from last
year to help out.”

Turley said he had not felt pressure
earlier to increase the amount of ads
sales, “but now I was being pres-
sured by the E.C. and the Phi. It was
very sudden. I hadn’t been warned. I
hadn’t been given an ultimatum.”

Butler, who was not at the special
meeting Wednesday, said, ‘‘We had

It’s highly unlikely for a person to
die from first-time use of cocaine, a
drug and alcohol expert from Char-
lottesville told an audience in Lee
Chapel on Monday night.

But coke is so addictive, said
Daniel J. O'Donnel, that a person
with unlimited access will choose it
ahead of the food and water needed to
survive.

Cocaine is a stimulant that speeds
up the heart and increases blood
pressure, but it’s unusual to have a
fatal reaction from a small dose, said
the director of medical services at

Charlottesville.

The greatest. danger is that it is
highly addictive, he said. Users build

The 116th annual celebration of
Washington and Lee’s Founders’ Day
will take place next Monday, bring-
ing with it an abbreviated class
schedule to allow for a special noon
assembly in Lee Chapel.

Founders’ Day was established by
the Board of Trustees of Washington
College, which resolved on the day of
Robert E. Lee's funeral that his
birthday, January 19, should always
be celebrated at the college.

The assembly marks the sixty-
third anniversary of Omicron Delta

O’Donnell, who also is a clinical
associate professor of psychiatry at
the University of Virginia, said he
rarely treated cocaine users who
didn’t have problems with other
drugs, including alcohol.

O’Donnel said he wanted to dispel
two major myths about coke—that it
is not addictive and that is is an
aphrodisiac.

Coke is very addictive, he said, On-
ly nicotine gets into the bloodstream
faster. And although cocaine may
heighten sexual awareness on a
short-term basis, it does not do so for
an extended time.

Although he opposes substance
abuse, O’Donnell did not preach at
all. His talk, which was titled ‘The
Agony and the Ecstasy—Designer
Drugs,’’ examined the effects of
coke, ecstasy nd other popular
drugs. '

Ecstasy, which is a chemically
modified form of amphetamine, was

students and four honorary initiates
will be tapped at the convocation, but
their names are kept secret until the
announcement at the assembly.

Most initiates are senior under-
graduates or third-year law students,
but a small number of students are
selected as juniors, The basic re-
quirements for selection, according
to this year's ODK president, Joe
Krastel, are exemplary character;

cause hallucinations and ‘‘bad

O’Donnell’s lecture was co-spon-
sored by the Alcohol and Health
Awareness Committee at W&L and
Mountain Wood, a treatment center
for drug and alcohol abuse.

Carol Ann Calkins, chairman of the
committee’s education subcom-
mittee, said she was pleased with the
lecture. She said she was thinking
about suggesting to the subcom-
mittee a follow-up discussion with
someone who had gone through a

OPINION

The Ring-tum Phi, January 15, 1987

 

Tribute

The Ring-tum Phi notes with sadness the death of Emory
Kimbrough Jr., and extends its condolences to Dr.Kim-
brough’s family and to the Washington and Lee community.

Dr. Kimbrough first joined the W&L faculty in 1962 and was
named chairman of the Sociology department five years
later. He taught until leaving Lexington early last Fall. Kim-
brough, a member of Phi Beta Kappa, authored several ar-
ticles in addition to teaching and studied at Oxford Universi-

ty.

A memorial fund which has been set up in Kimbrough’s
name is a fitting tribute to a man who gave so much to the
University.

Social frats

In last week’s Ring-tum Phi, Associate Dean of Students
Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy”’ Atkins was quoted as saying, ‘‘The obliga-
tion of a specific fraternity is to get as many people as possi-
ble to stay in Lexington and study. What the hell do you want
to do, party five days a week?”

Atkins, class of ’68, was a member of the Student Service
Society, a forerunner of Student Recruitment, the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon social fraternity and the Mongolian Minks.

The University’s Policy Statement on Fraternities, con-
tained in the 1986-87 catalog, states that ‘‘Social fraternities
at Washington and Lee are a valuable and integral part of
both the University and Lexington communities; as such,
fraternity chapters have important privileges, as well as
responsibilities to those communities.”

The key phrase is ‘‘social fraternity.”’

Atkins’ quote leads us to believe that he views fraternities
as academic study halls, not social outlets for W&L students.
This shows a lack of understanding of both the University’s
and the fraternities’ functions.

The University is the academic institution in student’s
lives. It is the responsibility of that institution to stimulate
the undergraduate’s intellectual and academic growth. If
W&L is not capable of fulfilling this job, then it is not the high
caliber school it is considered to be.

Fraternities at W&L provide a much needed social outlet
for students; a walk through Lexington will reveal very little
in the way of post-classroom relaxation. This is a problem af-
fecting all who live in Lexington, professors as well as
students.

While the Student Activities Board organizes Fancy Dress,
Wednesday night concerts in the GHQ in addition to other
concerts throughout the year, it is both unreasonable and
unrealistic to expect it to provide the bulk of W&L social ac-
tivity. Fraternities pick up the slack in the social schedule
and without them the majority of weekends would be devoid
of organized social activities.

Fraternities perform another service by acting as a con-
duit by which bonds of brotherhood and friendship are form-
ed, bonds which cannot be solidified while playing a
“‘charade.’’ Whenvever a fraternity sponsors an event, social
or charitable, such as the recent IFC food drive, it not only
gives brothers a feeling of accomplishment and pride as a
group, as well as providing a valuable service to the com-
munity, it is valuable PR for the University. Or is this a
charade, too?

Obviously fraternities have an obligation to the university
and to Lexington. But to say simply that students need to be
watched to make sure they study is doing a disservice to,
among others, the Admissions Office, which surely does not
admit students that it feels need to be watched.

Remember, “‘All work and no play make Jack a dull boy.”

Student says ‘truth’ hard to discern

 

MY VIEW
By Jennifer Spreng

 

The headline for the front-page
Richmond Times-Dispatch story on
Jan. 11 read, “Reports say CIA
operated illegally in aiding contras.””

My question is: Is anyone really
surprised?

Quite frankly, I’m not.

I haven’t really followed the

Iran/Contras/CIA/Regan/North-etc.
fiasco very closely. When I was in
high school, I used to get extremely
concerned about every little potential
scandal. I used to study all of the
reports in newspapers and news-
magazines in order to figure out the
truth. I was quite the little activist.

I guess I’ve really changed in that
respect.

To be very blunt about it, I am no
longer interested in the truth about
the Iran deal or any other such silly
charade. I think the whole concept of
impeaching President Regan is very
amusing, I really wish we could just
sweep all of this garbage under a rug
somewhere and forget about, it, with
the warning to whoever organized
the fool’s errand that it had better
never happen again.

I really don’t think that the truth
will ever be discernable. The more I
try to follow this business, the more I
realize that the whole thing has total-
ly been blown totally out of propor-
tion. Democrats are trying to bring
down the Republicans. Republicans
are desperate to shift the blame to
anybody but tneir major Presidential
candidates. Part of the problem is

that nobody’s interested in any truth
that doesn’t serve his purpose.

So I have to ask this question: Does
any truth exist? I doubt it. There is
certainly no truth that any govern-
ment commission will be able to fer-
ret out, no matter how much they
swear they know what really happen-
ed. The liberal use of the Fifth
Amendment alone makes that an im-

possibility.

The real problem is the nature of
evidence itself. Imagine a number of
witnesses to a car wreck at a four-
way stop. One says that the yellow
car was at fault. The other says that
there was no yellow car. Another
remembers serious injuries and lots
of blood. Another doesn’t wish to ad-
mit to himself that his jaywalking
caused the accident, so he describes
a head-on collision, that won’t make
him feel guilty. A fifth witness

couldn’t watch as victims were being,
removed from the cars, so he reports
that no one was hurt.

Lies? Not at all. Witnesses in that
situation believe that they are telling
the truth. Yet, what is the truth? It is,
a difficult problem, yes?

All of this speculation has been’
causing me to question much of what
I see and hear. If the facts are all
relative anyway, who cares what
they seem to mean. No matter how
conclusive evidence appears, there is
always another interpretation. Cer-'
tainly in those situations, it becomes
exceedingly dangerous to becor
overly judgemental about any’
even a slightly befuddled presi
who’s maybe an easy mark. I
the only healthy policy is to as
the best of everyone, and hope
eventually it does not bec:
necessary to believe the worst.

Rasicm is not confined to the south

 

MY VIEW
By Jeff Kelsey

 

I read with a great deal of interest
Tom Brickel’s ‘‘My View”’ last week
concerning the Howard Beach inci-
dent. I too followed the events of this
tragedy with a sense of outrage and
shame that such senseless violence
can occur in this nation. Yet there
was another event connected to the
Howard Beach incident which I found
equally disturbing. New York Mayor
Ed Koch, when commenting on the
incident, said he expected such
things in the Deep South, not in New
York. As a resident of that particular
region, I was incensed to think that
Koch could make such a slanderous
comment especially when the pro-
blem occurred in his backyard, not
mine. After all, Koch is an experienc-
ed politician, a man who controls a
city budget which is greater than the
Gross National Product of most na-
tions of the world. One would expect
a little more tact and a greater sense
of reality from such a man, yet Koch
demonstrates no such tact and

possesses a blatant disregard for the
reality of the situation. Racism is not
simply a regional problem but a pro-
blem built into all aspects of our
society. Blacks, Jews, orientals,
hispanics and every other ethnic
group have experienced their share
of bigotry throughout this country.
Koch evidently chooses to ignore
racism in other sectors, focusing in-
stead on the traditional scapegoat for
racial tensions, the South.

No doubt, many of you are thinking
that Koch’s comment was essentially
harmless and only my wounded pride
goads me into attacking him so.
While indeed my sense of honor did
spur me to write this article, there is
also something inherently dangerous
in Koch’s comment. First, the
Howard Beach incidenf represents a
senseless act of violence which oc-
curred simply because Michael Grif-
fith and his friends were black. In
responding to the situation Koch
seems equally eager to condemn peo-
ple simply because of demographics.
How can he really be surprised at the
Howard Beach affair when he holds
such biases himself? I wonder where

    

Mayor Koch gets his information
concerning Southern attitudes living,
as he does, well above the Mason-
Dixon line? I do not recall seeing any
lynchings or beatings at home over
break nor would I expect such oc-
currences as commonplace. Perhaps
the spirit of the season simply in-
fected me so I failed to notice the
overt racism which Mayor Koch
knows exists in my hometown.

Also, besides illustrating Mayor
Koch’s brased opinion his comments
perpetuate false ideas about
southern life. The condescending
tone of his comment reflects the at-
titude that the North holds a moral
superiority in race relations over the
South, To say that such an attitude is

hypocritical is a gross understate-
ment, especially in wake of what hap-
pened at Howard Beach. Koch seems
to have an ‘‘Easy Rider’ image of
southerners where we all drive
around in pick-up trucks, chewing
tobacco and shooting hippies for fur. ,
To perpetuate such attitudes
magifies regional differences a
does nothing to solve the problem-
the Howard Beach affair.

I would not be hypocritical er.
to suggest that racism no longer
ists in the South; however, for N
Koch to imply that such w.
violence is commonplace or expe eu
in the South is an insult which cannot »
be taken lightly.

Senior callsIFC revisions‘an embarrassment’

Leanne ee

TO the Editors:

The revised IFC constitution discussed in
Samuel Foley’s article in the January eighth Phi
should stand as an embarrassment to Wash-
ington and Lee.

While no one can deny the problems of poor
scholarship and possible alcohol abuse that the
new rules attempt to correct, the willingness of
Dean Atkins and the Alcohol Awareness Com-
mittee to side-step the ethics of proper procedure
in search of a solution is disturbing,

The method of forcing through revisions to the
constitution by threatening even stricter sanc-
tions from the Alcohol Awareness Committee if
the new rules are not passed is, plain and simply,
coercion. This has no place in a supposedly self-
governing fraternity system.

And what of these stricter rules that are being
held over the heads of the fraternities? If we
assume Dean Atkins’ and the AAC’s intentions
are legitimate, we then, naturally, assume that
the purpose of these rules is to impose no more or
no fewer restrictions than needed to correct the
problem. If this is the case, they are being
remiss in their duty to offer a compromise, as
Jimmy Holmes’ comments suggest they have.
Could it be that the severity of the rules with

 

 

which the fraternities are being treated come not
from the necessity of a solution to any problem,
but rather from the need for a crowbar with
which to force the desired outcome of a ‘‘vote’’?

The introduction of these sorts of underhanded
politics into the important decision making in
which the IFC has been involved over the past
few months will make the final vote little more
than (to borrow Dean Atkins’ phrase) a “‘stupid
charade.”

Finally, to answer Dean Atkins’ question, no,
most students at Washington and Lee do not feel
the need to party five days a week. But it is possi-
ble, sir, that an objection to the revisions could
legitimately come from another desire. Some-
where at the heart of honor is autonomy, We can
see this in the simplicity of the guidelines that
General Lee laid down for student conduct.
Although the gentlemanly ideal that Lee put
forth is not always met these days (as it was not
in his), its continued existence and support is an
integral part of this university. It is what brought
many of us to Washington and Lee in the first
place, and it is the thing with which most of us
would like to leave.

Mark Trainer '87

Frats are more than parties?
To the Editors:

The “stupid charade’ we have been playing
for years appears not to be that of fraternity life,
but rather in Dean Atkins’ perception of it.

Social life is hardly the only thing that frater-
nities provide. Has Dean Atkins ever heard of
Community Service Projects, Intramurals, or
any of the other activities of fraternities? Hov
quickly has fraternal participation in such
worthwhile causes as assisting the flood victims
and organizing blood drives been forgotten?
Neither of which, by the way, involved parties of
any sort.

Dean Atkins seems to forget that like the rest
of the student body, fraternities are comprised of
real human beings. We eat, sleep, breathe, study
and yes; we even sometimes party. But if we
were to party as much as Dean Atkins implies,
none of us could fulfill even the most minimal
academic standards at W&L (3 days a week is
quite sufficient).

It was a hard decision to speak out against
such an eloquent argument from a Dean of an in-
stitution of higher learning, but if we follow Dear,
Atkins’ demands, soon we may not be able to
take enough time off from studying to go to class.

W&L gets
large grant

Staff Reporters

 

 

The J. Howard Pew Freedom Trust
of Philadelphia has awarded Wash-
ington and Lee University a grant of

),000 for the purchase of science

uipment for the departments of

logy, chemistry, geology, physics,
¢d psychology.

4 | ‘One of the major challenges fac-
'{ colleges and universities today is
keep pace with the rapid changes

scientific equipment that have
> brought about by technological

“vances,” said H. Thomas Wil-

liams, associate dean of the college

of arts and sciences at Washington
and Lee and professor of physics.

‘“‘We must attempt to provide our
students with opportunities to work
with the most modern equipment.
This generous grant from the J.
Howard Pew Freedom Trust is an ex-
tremely important step toward
realizing that goal.”

A special committee has been
formed on the campus to examine
science instruction at Washington
and Lee and to evaluate the universi-
ty’s equipment and physical needs.
The purchases of scientific in-
strumentation to be supported by the
Pew grant will be based on recom-
mendations made by that committee.

The J. Howard Pew Freedom Trust
is one of the seven Pew Charitable
Trusts established by the surviving
sons and daughters of Joseph N.
Pew, founder of the Sun Oil Com-
pany. The Freedom Trust provides
support in the areas of education,
human services, public policy, and

Peer counseling to begin

Peer counselor training has been
completed, and will begin next week,
according to Dr. James Worth, uni-
versity psychiatrist.

The new program, similiar to peer
counseling groups at other univer-
sities, is a new idea for W&L. ‘‘The
idea has been in the back of my head
for a long time,” said Worth, but he
gave peer counseling program
stronger consideration after assum-
ing the chairmanship of the subcom-
mittee on counseling in the Alcohol
Awareness group. Worth said, ‘I
asked myself, ‘How can W&L provide
for students who have questions, pro-
blems and needs dealing with drugs
and alcohol?’ ”’ He concluded that a
great number of students would feel
uncomfortable setting up an appoint-

ment with a professional psycholo-
gist but hopes students will see the
peer counselors as ‘low-risk, no
titles, not employed by the universi-
ty” and easier to confide in. Another
plus, added Worth, is that the
counselor’s receive no compensation
which creates ‘‘a greater potential
for trust.”’

However, the peer counselors are
“not mini-psychiatrists. They are in-
tended for one, two, or three visits,”
said Worth.

The counselors main job “is to
listen, to assess whether it would be
good for them (the students) to see a
professional member of the staff and
to act as temporary relief,’ Worth
said.

The counselors will be available, or
on call, twenty-four hours a day. A
student can reach a counselor in

 

 

Washington and Lee University
has received a gift valued at more
than $600,000 from the late John G.
Hamilton, a 1932 graduate of the
university. The gift, made shortly
before Hamilton’s death, will be used
to create a named endowment for the
support of Washington and Lee’s
Reeves Center for Research and Ex-
hibition of Porcelain and Paintings.

Opened in 1982, the Reeves Center
houses Washington and Lee’s collec-
tion of ceramics and Chinese export
porcelain and many of the universi-

ty’s paintings. It also serves as an .

important study center for students
interested in the decorative arts.

“This major addition to Washing-
ton and Lee’s endowment will pro-
vide the means to improve and ex-
tend the excellent programs for
students in the Reeves Center,”’ said
W&L President John D. Wilson in an-
nouncing the gift.

Hamilton, who died Nov. 14, was
the former chairman of the board of
Redpath Inc., based in Denison, Tex-
as. He was long involved in the pro-
e-ems sponsored by the Reeves

er. He lived in Cincinnati for

1y years and was a resident of
Buca Raton, Fla., at the time of his
death.

several ways. Posters and cards that
have each counselors name and
number will be circulated around
campus, Worth said. Also, a student
can go to Carol Calkins’ office and
get the name and number of a
counselor from her. A third manner
of reaching a peer counselor is a
hotline, an idea thought of by the
students, said Worth. The hotline will
be open 7-11 p.m. daily and will allow
for a greater amount of anonymity.
Worth has high hopes for the hotline.

Worth’s goal for the peer counsel-
ing program is to have a peer coun-
selor from every fraternity, and to
have them available in Gaines Hall

hope is that we can have people out
there who are recognized as brained,

Lansing, Michigan, will present a
lecture entitled “PX Computerized
Chinese: The Rosetta Stone of the
U.S.-China Communications”’ in Nor-
then Auditorium in the University
Library on the campus of Washing-

at 8 p.m., January 15, is free and
open to the public.

Tien is an interdisciplinary scien-

complishments in the computer field
is a Chinese word processing system
that can produce some 20,000 Chinese

Tien’s work represents a major
breakthrough that may have a far-
reaching effect on China’s economy
and trade, as well as on its still untap-
ped scientific and technological
potential. The lecture will be directed
not only to those with special concern
for computers, but also to those in-

Murphy tells IFC ideas
for ‘rennaisance’

By SAMUEL FOLEY
Staff Reporter

The horizon is much brighter for
the future of fraternities on the
Washington and Lee campus. This
was the message conveyed by Col-
onel Paul Murphy, the president of
the Alumni fraternity council.

Murphy told the IFC represen-
tatives that they can expect more
support from the alumni. Murphy
apologized for the fact that fraternity
alumni support has been so weak in
recent years and said that he and the
council were trying to catch up as
fast as possible.

He also told the representatives
that the council would seek to get the
fraternities national leaderships to
give more help to the houses at
Washington and Lee.

Murphy outlined some of the goals

he would like to achieve in 1987
—strengthen the housing corpora-
tion’s participation with the frater-
nities, meet with university officials
to exchange views on the fraternity
system and encourage individual
houses to begin to develop a
renaissance program.

Murphy said, ‘‘The houses are in a
sad state of repair and need serious
renovation.”’

Two methods for funding this
renaissance were discussed at the
meeting; one would entail a universi-
ty fund-raising campaign the other
would involve a limited partnership
tax shelter deal similar to the one
that was used to rebuild the Phi Gam-
ma Delta house.

IFC President Chris Saxman said,
“If we do it right from the beginning
it could be a great success. It could
really strengthen the fraternity
system at W&L.”’

Travel discount offered

Dallas, December 22, 1986 — Col-
lege students traveling to Atlanta
from any destination served by
Trailways Lines, Inc. and _par-
ticipating carriers in the United
States, for the Martin Luther King,
Jr. Student Conference, will receive
a 30 percent fare discount when
traveling round-trip, announced
Robert Buschner, vice president of
marketing for Trailways Lines, Inc.

With a current student I.D. card,
college students may purchase a
Trailways ticket anytime from now
until the January 17 conference, but
tickets must be used for travel be-
tween January 14 and 22.

“This conference, sponsored by the
United States Student Association,
the Martin Luther King, Jr. Federal
Holiday Commission and the Martin
Luther King, Jr. Center for Non-

Violent Social Change, has been
designed to work with college
students with programs that com-
memorate the life of Dr. King and the
civil rights movement,’’ said Tom
Swan, president of the United States
Student Association.

‘The conference is a wonderful op-
portunity for students from around
the country to gather and discuss
some of the national and social issues
that are affecting their lives. It also
provides them with the opportunity
to voice their opinions in hopes of
making a difference in the world one
day. The Trailways Corporation has
always been a strong supporter of the
King Center, in Atlanta, and the crea-
tion of a Federal Holiday commemo-
rating the life of Dr. King. The 30%
discount fare they are offering to
students to attend this conference is
another example of that support.”

The J. Howard Pew Freedom Trust
of Philadelphia has awarded Wash-
ington and Lee University a grant of
$200,000 for the purchase of science
equipment for the departments of
biology, chemistry, geology, physics,

ing colleges and universities today is
to keep pace with the rapid changes
in scientific equipment that have
been brought about by technological
advances,” said H. Thomas Wil-
liams, associate dean of the college
of arts and sciences at Washington

Sweet Briar team to beat this season in ODAC

By MATHEW HORRIDGE
Staff Reporter

 

So far, 1987 has proven to be a year
in which hard work pays off and the
good guys win.

The squeaky-clean Nittany Lions
toppled the Miami Hurricanes for the
national championship. A battered
Washington Redskins team man-
handled the Chicago Bears. Add to
that list the Washington and Lee

Generals ‘physically’ beaten by
Greensboro after Invitational win

3y MIKE SHADY

Assistant Sports Editor

 

The Washington and Lee basket-
ball team was defeated. It’s as sim-
ple as that.

Coming off a weekend in which the
team won the W&L Invitational Tour-
nament, the Generals lost to an ex-
tremely talented UNC-Greensboro
squad by the score of 73-61 Tuesday
night in North Carolina.

“We got beat, physically,” said
head coach Verne Canfield. ‘“‘They
havea very fine ball club with a lot of
nice players. They are a team that
wants to go Division II next year and
they are only a few players away
from that.

‘‘We didn’t get the outside shooting

we needed and the game was very up °

tempo — we can’t play that way,” he
said.

W&L, after two consecutive games
of shooting 50% or better from the
field, could manage only a meager
39% against Greensboro. Senior Jef-
ferson Harralson, the game’s leading
scorer with 24 points, and junior
Steve Hancock were a combined 12 of
36.

“We were intimidated,” said Can-

field. ‘‘They put a couple of our early
shots into the bleachers and we tried
to adjust our shots instead of taking it
right at them.”

Canfield attributed the poor shoot-
ing performance to the Greensboro
deferise. ‘They totally took it too us
defensively,”’ he said. W&L trailed
by nine at halftime, 38-29.

A main concern for Canfield after
the game was not the General’s out-
side woes but the physical well-being
of his players, especially for tonight’s
game with archrival Roanoke Col-
lege. “‘We are physically bruised and
banged up,”’ he said.

The loss stops the General’s win-
ning streak at three games after an
impressive showing in last week-
end’s tournament.

W&L held off Newport News Ap-
prentice in the opener 85-78. The
Generals led by as many as 13 at one
point and were paced by Harralson
and Hancock who scored 25 and 22
points respectively. Senior Fred
Bissinger also played an outstanding
game scoring nine points on 4 for 5
from the field, dishing out four
assists, and holding Newport News at
bay late in the game with two key
jumpers.

Turnovers were the difference be-
tween the two teams as Newport
News coughed it up 23 times. The
Generals took much better care of
the ball, totaling only 15 pastries.

The win slated W&L in the finals
versus Philadelphia College of Phar-
macy and Science, a 63-62 overtime
winner over Kean College. Philadel-
phia was anything but impressive;
however, they had a few surprises for
WA&L in the final.

With the Generals playing an ag-
gressive man-to-man defense, a less
talented Philadelphia ran a motion
offense that confused W&L. Revers-
ing the ball quickly around the
perimeter, Philadelphia was able to
run backscreens and hit players
down low for easy baskets. Even with
their success in the paint, Phila-
delphia still trailed 31-27.

“Tt was an offense we’ve never fac-
ed,”’ said Harralson. ‘‘In the second
half we started anticipating and com-
ing away with steals.”’

“We played two different zones and
just called attention to what they
were doing,” said Canfield. ‘‘Credit
to them, but we didn’t take anything
away defensively.”

Wé&L hopes to shipwreck Maroons

By JIM LAKE
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee basket-
ball team will face perennial rival
Roanoke College tonight at 7:30. The
Generals’ expect one of their largest
crowds of the season for tonight’s
game at the Warner Center.

The Maroons, with all five of their
starters back from last season, were
ranked fifth in the nation in Division
III before losing their last two
games. Generals’ head coach Verne
Canfield describes Roanoke as
“smooth, poised, and experienced.”’
The Maroons come into tonight’s con-
test with a 6-2 overall record, in-
cluding a ten-point loss to NAIA
member Anderson College in their
last game. Tonight’s game will be the
conference opener for Roanoke, as
well as the Maroons’ first game in
over five days.

Roanoke leads the ODAC in team
defense, allowing an average of only
61 points per game. Individually, the
Maroons feature the ODAC’s leading
rebounder, junior forward James
Pennix, who averages ten boards per
outing. Their leading scorer is
sophomore forward Taylor Livic, a
56% field goal shooter who averages
13.5 points per contest.

While Roanoke may have the best
defense in the conference, their of-
fense is dead last, with an average of
less than 69 points per game. The
Maroons, who shoot 46% from the
field, are the worst free throw
shooting team in the ODAC; they are
only 69% from the line for the season,
despite 83% shooting from junior
guard Bill McCormick.

Canfield expects Roanoke to come
out in a box-and-one defense, with
one player guarding senior forward
Jefferson Harralson in a tight man-
to-man and the rest of the Maroons
playing a zone. Because of tight

coverage on  Harralson, the
Generals’ head coach says that
“Steve Hancock must score” for
W&L to be successful.

The Generals are still recovering
from a very physical game against
UNC-Greensboro. Canfield says that
junior forward Gary Schott will pro-
bably be hampered by a thumb in-
jury for the rest of the week, but
sophomore guard Manny Klump
should be over a sprained ankle in
time for tonight’s contest.

Off the court, tonight’s game is ex-
pected to feature the return of ‘‘The
Unknown Fans,”’ who always seem to
show up for the Roanoke game. Can-
field says that he is looking forward
to the enthusiastic support of ‘‘those
guys with the bags.”’ The Generals’
head coach says that his team “‘real-
ly appreciates the support’’ that the
student body has given throughout
the season. ‘‘It really means a lot to
the players,’’ he says.

ed off the biggest upset of 1987 by
edging Sweet Briar, 71-68, ina double
dual meet last night at Cy Twombly
Pool.

Freshman Debbie Grove said the
victory was ‘‘definitely sweet.”’

The meet’s outcome was decided
by the last race of the night, the 400-
yard freestyle relay. The Generals’
team, made up of sophomores Eliza-
beth Miles and Nancy Whalen and
freshmen Kris Amoroso and Grove,
soundly defeated the Sweet Briar en-
try.

The Vixens have been the con-
ference champions for the last four

years, and W&L head coach Page
Remillard was very happy with the
victory.

“Our game plan was to swim our
butts off,’’ Remillard said, ‘‘and if
they made a mistake, we'd be there.”

The Generals also faced the Ran-
dolph-Macon Woman’s College team
in last night’s meet and soundly
defeated the Wildcats, 105-37.

The Generals had a very sound
night, racking up seven first-place
finishes, eight second-place finishes
and five third-place finishes.

Miles had the best individual effort
of the evening for the Generals,

 

 

winning the 200-yard freestyle, the
200-yard backstroke, and the 500-
yard freestyle races.

Freshman Heather Logan record-
ed victories in the 100- and 200-yard
breast stroke races, and Whalen won
the 100-yard freestyle race.

Freshman Beth Stutzmann placed
third overall in the one meter spring-
board competition, and sophomore
Alston Parker placed second on the
three-meter springboard.

The men’s and women’s teams tra
vel this weekend to face Frostburg
and Georgetown.

Junior Lou Trosch wins the opening tip in Friday’s game against Newport News
Apprentice. The Generals went on to win 85-78.

Canfield’s plan for the second half
worked as the Generals packed the
defense inside and forced Philadel-
phia to bomb away. After shooting
41% in the first half, Philadelphia
plummeted to 35% in final period.

Stamina also played a large role as
Philadelphia only dressed nine

players for the game. Towards the
end of the contest, the Generals
began to wear Philadelphia down and
pulled away for the tourney cham-
pionship.

“Everybody feels that we can win
close games now,”’ said Harralson.

‘‘We have that winning attitude. We
not only come into a game thinking
we can win but expecting to win.”

Heisman Trophy proves to be Testaverde’s - downfall

I know everyone’s sick of reading about college foot-
ball, especially what Sports Illustrated called the ‘‘In-
creda Bowl,” the big one, the National Championship,
the bow! to end all bowls. But here’s one more column
on the 1987 Fiesta Bowl. After this, you can forget about
college football until next season (or at least until
spring practice starts).

I didn’t hate Miami in September. In fact, I admired
their exciting offense, their spectacular quarterback,
and their underrated defense. Sure, coach Jimmy
Johnson ran up the score on Notre Dame in 1985, but
every football coach in America dreams of beating up
on the Irish. And besides, Tennessee returned the favor
on New Year’s night of 1986. So there was really no
reason to hate Miami, until...

The December 1 issue of The Sporting News had a
cover story on Vinny Testaverde that revealed an awful
lot about the Miami QB. According to TSN, Testaverde
was committed to winning the Heisman Trophy. In fact,
he wanted it so badly that he ‘‘spent preseason practice
wearing a shirt decorated with a picture of the trophy,
just to keep his mind focused.’’ Miami kicker Mark
Seelig told TSN that Testaverde keeps a picture of Doug
Flutie in his Miami apartment with the words ‘‘Heis-
man Trophy” in the middle.

Miami fans will quickly respond, what’s wrong with
that? And, to an extent, they’re right. It’s great for
someone to want to succeed. But a team should be an
athlete’s first priority. Testaverde seemed to want to be
great for all the wrong reasons. Maybe my concept of
sports is outdated, but I always thought of college foot-
ball as a team sport, with all the players working
together toward a common goal: the national cham-
pionship. I find it very difficult to admire a football
player (or any athlete, for that matter) who is playing

for individual honors. Testaverde seemed to be so
obsessed with winning the Heisman that, for him, the
Fiesta Bowl would be purely an after-thought (And,
judging from the way the Miami QB played, it may well
have been).

But my faith in college athletes was rewarded. Twen-
ty pages later, in the very same issue of The Sporting
News, a story on Penn State runningback D.J. Dozier
reassured me that there is at least one team-oriented
athlete left in America. TSN called Dozier ‘‘the calm in
the middle of a media storm.”’ In the Nittany Lions’
first nine wins, he gained only 657 yards ‘‘because (head
coach Joe) Paterno doesn’t believe in piling up an in-
dividual’s statistics at the expense of the team.’’ And
Dozier seemed to agree with this philosophy; he told
TSN that “I didn’t come to Penn State to win a Heisman
Trophy. I came in the hopes we could win a national
championship.”

Skip to the night of January 2, 1987. For the rest of his
life, Testaverde will have to remember his ‘‘decision.”’

Hurricane tailback Alonzo Highsmith has already
gained 120 yards on only eight carries, and Penn State
has been dropping everybody to cover the Miami
receivers, Miami backup quarterback Geoff Torretta
told SI that, ‘‘from the five yard line, Alonzo could have
flown over.’ The head coach says, ‘Run it.” The assis-
tant coaches say, ‘‘Run it.”” The backup QB says, “Run
it.” But Testaverde wants to pass. Later, Johnson
would tell SI, ‘‘We were all very frustrated, but we gave
in. He wanted to throw it, and he felt good about it, so we
went withit.”’

Skip to January 5, 1987. See Testaverde, holding his
Heisman, looking at the sports page from Saturday
morning, staring at the headline, ‘“‘Penn State tops

Miami,”’ imagining what could have been. Now see
Dozier, standing with his teammates, holding their
NCAA National Championship Trophy, looking at the
very same headline, remembering what was.

Maybe, just maybe, if Testaverde hadn’t been so
damn cocky, he would've listened to his coaches and
given the ball to Highsmith on second and goal, and
Penn State would have been denied a national title once
again. Instead, Testaverde was sacked for a six yard
loss, forcing him to throw on third down. After an in-
completion, the ‘‘Increda Bow!”’ boiled down to one ‘‘In-
creda Play,” in which the athlete that The New York
Athletic Club called ‘best college football player in
America’ threw his fifth intercention of the night, a
perfect spiral which landed right in the hands of the
receiver — Penn State linebacker Pete Giftopoulos.

Every once in a while, an event in sports proves to be
more than just a game; athletics can provide a wonder-
ful allegory, a valuable lesson for us all. As Sports Il-
lustrated pointed out, the 1987 Fiesta Bowl featured a
team of athletes working together with excellent
coaches to defeat a stronger opponent. It seems that the
“Increda Bowl"’ lived up to it’s billing, in that it has
done more than entertain us; it has also taught us a
lesson about the value of dedication and teamwork.

So congratulations to D.J., and to Coach Pa, and to all
the rest of the Nittany Lions, You've earned it, And con-
grats to Vinny, too, for winning the Heisman. But just
one question, Vinny: how does it feel? I bet D.J. doesn’t

envy you a bit, but I bet you're just a little jealous of
him, aren’t you? To my way of thinking, individual
honors are nice, but I'll go along with Dozier and Pater

no; I’drather have a National Championship.

Paul Newman hustles a hit

“The object of 9-Ball is to sink the
balls in consecutive order and then
drop the nine. A player can make
eight trick shots, blow the nine, and
lose. Then again, he can make the
nine on the break—and win.’’ Con-
trol. Everybody wants it; very few
have it.”’

In 1961, ‘“THE HUSTLER,” Robert
Rossen’s film about a wandering pool
player that takes on the legendary
Minnesota Fats, received countless
Oscar nominations and was acclaim-
ed as one of that year’s best. Now 26
years later, Paul Newman returns to
his Oscar nominated role as the
wandering ‘‘Fast Eddie’’ Felson in
Martin Scorsese’s blockbuster ‘“THE
COLOR OF MONEY.” It is well cast,
well made, and sizzles with Control.

Newman puts in one of the finest
performances of his career as the
now older and retired ‘‘Fast Eddie.”
The film opens in the bar/pool hall
that he has retired to since leaving
the professional pool circuit. It is
here that he first encounters Vincent
Lauria (Tom Cruise), a wet-nosed,
thick-skulled kid who can shoot the
eyes out of a pool table. Felson seems
himself in Vincent. In him, he sees
what he used to be and what he sup-
posedly can no longer do. Being the
Hustler that he is, Felson persuades
Vincent and his girlfriend Carmen
(Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio) to go
with him on the road. There, Vincent
can learn the ropes, learn the big-
time, learn how to hustle. The
Ultimate Goal—The 9-Ball Cham-
pionships in Atlantic City.

Learning the ropes turns out to be
much harder than anticipated,
though, and Felson and Lauria split,
leaving the film’s climaxing end in
the balance.

This is a great pool movie, but it’s
about much more than just pool.
“THE COLOR OF MONEY” is about
life; it’s about paying the price.
“Pool Excellence is not about Ex-

cellent Pool. It’s about becoming
something, a_ student...of human
moves.’’ Newman's line is exem-
plary of the film’s message.
Everything has a price and everyone
can learn something new. ‘‘The best
is the one with the most”’ but to be the
best, you have to pay the price.

The cinematography in the prac-
tice rooms and pool halls en route to
Atlantic City, as well as the scenes in
the tournament are fantastic and will
probably win the cinematographer
an Oscar nomination, This movie will
do for your pool playing what
“ROCKY” did for your fitness. If you

Film Society draws sizeable crowd

By MICHAEL TUGGLE
Staff Reporter

 

If someone were to describe to you
a group of 250 people at one single
event, what would you think of? A
Fraternity party? A mandatory lec-
ture? A swim meet between two of
the girls schools perhaps? How about
at a showing by the Washington and
Lee Film society? Well believe it!
Last weekend, the film society was
faced with a very pleasant surprise;
200 to 250 people at both showings of
“Erendira’, the award-winning
Spanish film they were showing. ,Ac-
cording to President Rob Merritt, the

film society has been getting about
250 a weekend for its showings, but
last weekend there were that many
for each performance.

The film society tries to show one
film per month, or about nine to tena
year. ‘The films we try to get are
award winners or acclaimed films
that the audience may not get to see
otherwise in Lexington. We try to
provide a program that is culturally
valuable through the film art’ com-
mented Merritt. A meeting of the
film society is scheduled for a few
weeks from now and will be posted.
Merritt welcomed anyone to come
and urges those wanting to see a
particular film to come to the

W&L

meeting and contribute their sugges-
tion.

The film society has two films
scheduled at the present time to be
shown later in the term. The first is a
French film called ‘The Return of
Martin Guerre.”’ The second is a film
that recently appeared on Home Box
Office called ‘Choose Me.’’ They, as
are all film society presentations, are
open to the public free of charge.
However, contributions can be made
by those desiring to support the film
society. Merritt noted that with these
contributions the film society wants
to arrange for a film related speaker
to appear at W&L some time next
year.

Holiday’s
validity

questioned

From The New York Times
By LENA WILLIAMS

 

 

WASHINGTON — One year after
the civil rights struggles of the Rev.
Martin Luther King, Jr. were of-
ficially recognized by the federal
government with a national holiday
in his honor, some of the controversy
that surrounded efforts to win that
recognition has not yet been resolv-
ed.

Forty states and four United States
territories observed official holidays
this year honoring King with par-
ades, concerts, speeches and other
programs. Most of those celebrations
took place Monday, Jan. 19, the third
Monday in January, which was
designated by Congress as the of-
ficial national holiday.

Some states and cities have
designated Jan. 15, King’s actual
birthday, as the official holiday.

Easter clashes with class

By GEORGE G. SPARACIO
Staff Reporter

 

Spring Term classes will begin
Monday, April 20, the day after
Easter. Dean Peppers, the chairman
of the Faculty Executive Committee,
said that, even if the students peti-
tion, no changes could be made in the
calendar at such a late date.

Steven R. Doran ’87 brought this
conflict to the attention of the
Washington and Lee community in
his Jan. 8 letter to the Phi. Doran said
that Easter is ‘‘a time when families
and friends gather together and visit,
a sometimes infrequent opportuni-
ty.’’ However, the feeling of students
in general is one of indifference. In
addition, it does not seem as though
the faculty put much thought into the
matter when they passed the calen-
der.

Coach McHenry, the Director of
Athletics, faculty advisor to The
Fellowship of Christian Athletes and
member of The Committee on Regis-
tration and Class Schedules, said that
although it is difficult to travel on the
Easter, “I would be much more of-

Honorary ODK initiates (left to right) John W. Warner, Robert W. Meador, Shuford

fended if classes started on a holi-
day.”

Scott Dittman, chairman of The
Committee on Registration and Class
Schedules, said that the question of
religious observance was considered
at the last faculty meeting. A motion
was passed that reads: ‘“The Univer-
sity recognizes the importance of ho-
ly day celebrations and enceurages
all faculty to make any accommoda-
tions necessary for student obser-
vances.’’ However, this motion was
in reference to school beginning on
Rosh Hashanah in 1988.

Although it would be difficult to
respect all religious holidays, the

issue was avoided with this state-
ment. Coach McHenry did not recall

of the question of Easter even being
addressed at the time when the 86-87
calendar was approved.

President Wilson said that there
are always conflicts with the calen-
dar. “It’s a tortured kind of pro-
blem....The University could and
should pay more attention.”

ODK inducts new members

 

By MARGARET PIMBLETT
Staff Reporter

 

As part of Monday’s Founders’
Day celebration, 23 students and four
honorary initiates were inducted into
Omicron Delta Kappa, the national
collegiate honor fraternity which was
founded at Washington and Lee in
1914.

Henry J. Abraham, the James
Hart Professor of Government and
Foreign Affairs at the University of
Virginia, was the principal speaker.

W&L’s Alpha Circle of ODK was
founded by a group of W&L students
to honor leadership and service in
various aspects of campus life.

The honorary initiates were:
Robert W. Meador, senior vice presi-
dent of Dominion Bank of Lexington
and an active community volunteer:
John Edmonds Neill, a 1938 graduate

and retired businessman from South-
ern Pines, N.C.; Shuford Reinhardt
Nichols, a 1930 graduate and presi-
dent of Southern Compress Co. in
North Little Rock, Ark.; and John W.
Warner, ‘49 graduate and Virginia’s
senior Senator from Middleburg, Va.

Meador, a native of Vinton, joined
the First National Exchange Bank
(now Dominion Bank) in 1960. He
was named chief executive officer of
the Lexington operation in 1975, was
named a senior vice president of
Dominion in 1980, and continues to
head the Lexington operation of
Dominion

He has been state president of the
Virginia Jaycees, organizing presi-
dent of the Lexington Downtown
Development Association, and presi-
dent of the Lexington-Rockbridge
Chamber of Commerce, and is cur-
rently treasurer of the Historic Lex-
ington Foundation

A. as te ce
In times past

Calendar problems date back to
Robert E. Lee’s term as President
of Washington College. This anec-
dote comes from Fredrick L.
Riley’s book, ‘General Robert E.
Lee after Appomatox,”’ upon sug-
gestion from President Wilson.

The students were to receive on-
ly Christmas day off from classes.
This being the case, the students
petitioned for a week-long holi-
day. The petition was rejected by
President Lee. The students then
circulated another petition pledg-
ing that all signers would not at-
tend classes during Christmas
week. The faculty were going to
cancel classes as well. However,
Lee took a stand. He announced
that any student whose name ap-
peared on the petition would be
expelled. If all the students sign-
ed, the college would close.

Needless to say, there was a
mad charge by students to strike
their names from the list.

in celebration

The white lapel ribbons contrasted
sharply with the black tuxedo jackets
worn by the members of Washington
and Lee’s Glee Club on Monday
night.

The ribbons were a small but visi-
ble part of the Martin Luther King
Day celebration held at the First
Baptist Church in Lexington. Some
members of the W&L community
wore the ribbons throughout the day
in remembrance of King’s vision of
brotherhood and equality.

About 250 people — mostly students
and faculty from W&L and the neigh-
boring Virginia Military Institute
—attended the ceremony, which was
sponsored by the W&L Minority Stu-
dent Association. More than half of
the people there were white.

Guest speaker Johnny E. Morri-
son, commonwealth’s attorney for
the city of Portsmouth, admonished
the audience to keep alive King’s
dream of peace and unity.

At a schoolwide gathering earlier
in the day, W&L President John D.
Wilson also cited King’s dream.

Wearing a white ribbon to the
Founder’s Day ceremony in Lee Cha-
pel, Wilson noted that King and
Robert E. Lee were similar in that
they both worked for reconciliation
and understanding. Lee became
president of W&L after the Civil War
because he wanted to help end

regional misunderstanding. Until his
death in 1968, King led a peaceful yet
powerful fight against racial misun-
derstanding.

Morrison, 34, said that we all must
stop blaming others for our own pro-
blems. But he also implied that many
of our woes are the fault of President
Ronald Reagan.

“He’s a nice person. But he’s not
right for America,’ Morrison said.
Many in the crowd applauded.

One of the first blacks to graduate
from W&L, Morrison said that when
he was young, there were things he
couldn’t do and places he couldn’t go
because he was black. That has
changed because of men like King,
but other problems still exist.

If King were alive today, he would
ask Ronald Reagan some tough ques-
tions about South Africa, the drug
situation and other topics of concern,
Morrison said. He would ask why
billions of dollars were being spent on
sophisticated weaponry instead of
education. But he also would call
upon us to do our best and develop
self-respect.

We must sit down and talk about
problems such as teenage pregnancy
and the dropout rate, Morrison said.
Parents must start spending more
quality time with their children. And
college students must start giving
more to the community, to start be-
ing more concerned about the less
fortunate, about senior citizens.

Morrison stressed that King was a
force across the entire nation, the
type of person who was willing to pay
the price and make the sacrifice. And
yet he was human, like us.

“Martin was a drum major for
justice. He was a drum major for
peace,” Morrison said. ‘‘It all come
back to the basic principle, which is
to help your fellow man.”’

Morrison received both his under-

. graduate and law degrees from

W&L. A Portsmouth native, he is in
his second term as commonwealth’s
attorney.

Earlier in the day, he received the
third annual Martin Luther King, Jr.
Achievement Award from Old Domi-
nion University for exemplifying the
ideals and philosophy of King.

Symposium to be
held on sororities

 

By VALERIE PIERSON
Staff Reporter

 

The Women’s Forum has planned a
symposium entitled ‘Sororities and
Alternatives,’’ for Saturday, January
24, in the Moot Court Room in Lewis
Hall.

Working in conjunction with the
Sorority Advisory Committee, the
Women’s Forum will begin the sym-
posium at 9 a.m. with a continental
breakfast. Representatives from
Dickinson College, the University of
the South and the University of Rich-
mond will make presentations ex-
plaining their different approaches to
social outlets for women.

The goal of the symposium is to in-
form the women at Washington and
Lee of the many social alternatives
available. At Dickinson College there
are nationally affiliated sororities,
and at the University of the South,
there are local sororities.

A Washington and Lee freshman
shot a 15-year-old girl with a blow

The girl, a local high school stu-

seriously.

Following the general format of the
fraternity symposium held last fall,
each school will have fifteen minutes
to make its presentation. A question
and answer session will immediately
follow the presentation in order to
allow as many opinions as possible to
be expressed.

Sophomore Elizabeth Cummins, a
member of the Sorority Advisory
Committee, commented, ‘We're
looking not only for a social outlet,
but also an educational one with
possibilities for leadership, friend-
ship and unity.”’

Sophomore Caroline Boone added
that the symposium will be extreme-
ly open to any ideas proposed, and
she was hopeful that people with dif-
ferent opinions would show up for the
symposium. Invitations were sent to
all undergraduate women, all women
faculty members, as well as to the
administration. ‘‘Sororities and
Alternatives”’ will, however, be open
to the public, and any interested peo-
ple are encouraged to attend.

where he lives, and some Roanoke
fans who were leaving the game were
making degrading comments to in

Sampson estimated that the
Roanokers were between 50 and 75
yards away. He said he knew he
could not shoot the dart that far but
thought that it might intimidate
them.

“It was not out of malice. It was out
of anger,’’ Sampson said.

He said he did not even know the
dart had hit anyone until the next
day. He wrote the girl an apology

Murray said the dart was at least
four inches long

It hit the girl in the back of the
shoulder, Atkins said, penetrating

OPINION

The Ring-tum Phi, January 22, 1987

 

To the board

President Wilson did not give his annual state of the univer-
sity speech during the ODK convocation, a subject too impor-
tant not to be addressed.

Borrowing from Wilson’s speech given last year at this
time, it is safe to say that the state of Washington and Lee is
basically sound, basically but not entirely.

Everyone associated with Washington and Lee is proud
and fiercely protects this changing institution, and no one can
deny that W&L has changed in the last few years.

Members of the class of 87 are in a unique position: half of
their collegiate career was spent at an all-male institution,
and half at a coeducated one. While it is, in all probability,
futile to discuss the merits and demerits of coeducation, one
aspect of that radical move deserves to be discussed.

For over two hundred years this university was all male
and produced many men of high stature. To act as if the
University was founded on July 14, 1984 is to do a disservice,,
not only to those who graduated before that infamous date,,
but also to succeeding generations of W&L students. There is
a rich tradition of excellence at W&L, a tradtion impossible
acquire in a little over two years. The present university
reads well on paper, but it takes more than pieces of paper to
create a university.

Another decision was made in July of 1984, one that can be
changed with relative ease. To increase the size of the stu-
dent body is detrimental to the well-being of the university.

Our size is one of the few remaining characteristics that sets;
us apart from your run-of-the-mill university.

Classes that once contained no more, if not less than 12 or
15 students, now have 25 to 30 students in them. It is easy to
think that both students and teachers are losing out on
something as class sizes increase. One-on-one relationships
are beneficial — even more so when such a relationship ex-
ists between a teacher and a student. If a professor teaches
three classes, how can such relationships thrive? Are the
days of classes with only three or four students in them on
their way out?

Another subject that warrants discussion is the teaching
system at W&L. Professors at this acclaimed university
teach first, publish second; teaching after all is their chosen
profession. To force them to publish is to force them to take
time away from teaching. Is this a university or a publishing
house?

The board of trustees meets in Lexington in a few weeks. It
is hoped that they will address the issues raised in this
editorial. Washington and Lee joined the ranks of just about
every other university in the country by becoming coedu-
cated. But it still has the right stuff (apologies to Mr. Wolfe
for the pun) to set it apart from other universities. Decisions
made by the board of trustees will determine whether or not
this happens.

Sacred

It is disturbing that Spring Term classes will begin on
Easter Monday this year. Easter is the most important date
in the Christian calendar. Christ’s resurrection symbolizes
man’s ability to overcome death and live eternally. As the
calendar stands now, observance of this event will be cut
short.

President Wilson was correct in saying that ‘‘The Universi-
ty could and should pay more attention (to conflicts with the
calendar due to religious holidays). What is also troubling is-
Dean Peppers’ comment that no changes in the calendar
could he made at such a late date. It is ironic that man can
overcome death, but he cannot overcome bureaucratic red
tape.

While changing the calendar at such a late date may be in-
convenient for those who take care of such things, there is
precedent for change.

During the 1983-84 school year, Winter Term classes were
scheduled to begin on January 2, a Monday. The powers that
be decided that they did not want the students travelling back
to Lexington on New Year’s Day. Classes that first week of
the term were held from Tuesday through Saturday. .

There is a difference between New Year’s Day and Easter
Sunday. While New Year’s Day appears to have lost
whatever religious significance it once had, Easter Sunday
has not. If the calendar could be changed to allow students
extra time to party, a change could certainly be made so they
can observe Christ’s resurrection.

US movies cause misconception

 

MY VIEW
By Paul J. Smith

 

Movies are fun. They’re creative,
imaginative, and exciting. Funda-
mental to American culture, they
portray our lives, debate our issues,
suffer through our tribulations.
Movies are as American as apple pie,
and Chevy trucks.

But wait...What many Americans
-~ not realize is that their life-
styles, beliefs, sexual habits,
etc..which movies are so consciously
trying to portray on the big screen for
all Americans are available for the
whole world as well. From Peking to
Paris, Sydney to Stockholm, the
fruits of Hollywood are for everyone
to enjoy.

In this respect, American movies
are more than just modes of enter-
tainment. In fact, movies become
vehicles of cultural export, which
leads to a phenomenon best describ-
ed as ‘‘misconception panorama.”’

For example, last year as an ex-
change student in Taiwan, I was ap-

proached on one occasion by a stu-
dent who asked me how many gun-
fights I had witnessed while living in
America. ‘“‘None’’, I answered rather
dumbfounded. He insisted, however,
that he had seen many gunfights in
movies between police and drug
dealers, or between gangsters.
“That’s not reality,” I protested. He
walked away somewhat confused.

Ona recent trip to Tokyo, I met one
Japanese who told me at the outset of
our encounter, ‘‘I don’t like Ameri-
cans.”’ Somewhat caught off guard, I
tried to squeeze out “Why is that?”’
“They are materialistic, ruthless,
uncaring people,”’ he replied. I asked
him if he had been to America. ‘“‘NO”’
he replied. It turns out that he had
recently seen the movie ‘To Live and
Die in LA,” a movie that portrays
just the sort of society he described. I
tried to convince him that the U.S.
was not as bad as the movie por-
trayed. But in the end, I don’t think
he was convinced.

One Japanese with whom I spoke in
Tokyo went so far as to formulate a
very negative opinion on the Ameri-
can political system based on a
movie she had recently seen called
“POWER” starring Richard Gere.
As a member of the voting public of

Japan, there is very good chance that
she will vote for a party opposed to
improved U.S.-Japanese relations,
because of one movie. She has never
been to the United States.

Movies, I am convinced, are pro-
bably the single most important
media source on which foreigners
formulate their impressions and
opinions of the U.S. Whether the
movie’s subject is near or far from
the truth, its images are concrete and
convincing. When people see events
whether on the screen or in reality,
they consider, deliberate, and judge.
Finally, they develop opinions which
can, depending on the type of polit-
ical system, support or oppose im-
proved relations with the U.S.

In this capacity, movies probably
have more impact on the success or
failure of American foreign policy
than the U.S. government supported
Voice of America, Radio Free
Europe, or publications of the U.S.
Information Agency. Movies, put
simply, can have a tremendous im-
pact on American diplomatic efforts
abroad. Consider this: The U.S.
wishes to improve relations with a
nation where sexual promiscuity is
taboo. Practically any rated ‘“R”’
American movie would portray a

negative image of the U.S. among the
populace. Or, for exainple, take a.
communist or socialist nation, with
which the U.S. would like improved ‘
relations. A film such as “Rambo,
First Blood Part II” would leave
much to be desired in this nation, for
obvious reasons.

But nothing drives this point home
like an experience I had last year. A
group of Chinese classmates and I
were watching a rather lewd and ,
sexy American film. Suddenly
without warning the heroine started
doing something with the hero in an
explicit manner.

“I didn’t know American girls
were like this,’ one Chinese ~
classmate says.

“Uh...well, sometimes.” I say,
feeling somewhat exposed, the same

way one would feel if his own family ‘

films were being viewed by
strangers. ‘‘Why can’t they keep this
stuff within the country,” I whisper
to myself.

“Pardon?”

“Uh...I say, “I wish we could ‘

watch another channel.”
“Sure, but this is from your coun-
try. You should like it,”’ they insist.
“Oh, but I do,” I confess. And we
continue to watch.

Student groups must work together

 

MY VIEW
By Dana Bolden

 

 

I realize that the Ring-tum Phi is
not the place for fairy tales, but let
me share this one.

Once upon time there was a college
campus (Washington and Lee’s if you
must) and the most effective organi-
zations on this campus were the ones
that were student run. These
organizations always accomplished
their goals and worked together.
Then one day a strange fog settled
over this campus and caught it by
surprise. Everything that was stu-
dent run seemed to fall apart and
none of the groups wanted to work
together anymore.

One day, one of the groups on cam-

To the Editors:

of the bylaws from the IFC.

 

It amazes me that the replacement of Coke
with Pepsi stirs a greater amount of interest
than the proposed overhauling of the IFC con-
stitution. The professed goal of these changes is
to substantially decrease the amount of “‘party-
ing’’ and increase the amount of studying. The
lack of bylaws encouraging people “‘to stay in
Lexington and study” and the number of bylaws
covering fraternity social activities may cause
some people to accuse Buddy Atkins not of play-
ing charades, but of screening the true intentions

pus wanted to have a celebration to
honor one of their heroes. The
members in the group worked dili-
gently to organize this celebration.
One member wrote an article for the
student run newspaper and described
everything that was going to happen.
Now in this article he also asked
everyone to wear a ribbon in honor of
their hero in hopes that this might br-
ing back the unity between these
groups. Much to the members
dismay, the paper came out and con-
tained nothing about the group’s
celebration nor their ribbons. Not on-
ly did this hurt the groups pride, I’m
sure it hurt the turnout at the
celebration also. However, all was
not lost for the group because two
other student run groups helped out,
the radio and television stations, by
annoucing the celebration over the
airwaves.

The day after this dilemma oc-
curred, the student run government
requested that the members of this

same group present their budget,
less than one hour before their
celebration was to begin. Although
the members thought this was a
great inconvenience they agreed to
go and decided they would use this
opportunity to extend a special in-
vitation to the members of the stu-
dent government. Well, the celebra-
tion began and one of the members of
the group who was on stage scanned
the audience high and low looking for
any of the members of the student
government. Finally, about five
minutes before the celebration ended
one of the brave members of student
government showed up. Since both
the celebration group member and
student government member were
good friends, the member on the
stage figured “better late than
never.”

It was obvious that the fog still had
not left the campus. One day two
students got together and wanted to

OPINION/NE

LEXICON

 

By Steve Pockrass

-reshman idealism
turns to apathy

“Barf!”

That was my gut reaction when I read Jennifer Spreng’s first “‘My

View” in the Phi on Oct. 16.

When I read her Jan. 15 ‘“‘My View,”’ I just shook my head.

The first column was an orgasmic outpouring of loyalty to W&L ex-
hibited by a wide-eyed, idealistic freshman. The most recent was an
explanation of why that same freshman no longer cared about the

truth of the Iran/Contra scandal.

It is a textbook example of the changes that seem to occur among

many college students.

In her first “‘My View,’’ Miss Spreng wrote, ‘“‘W&L is not a place to
be, but a way of life.” I hope she’s wrong. The true W&L way of life
seems to be better exemplified by her most recent column.

Once upon a time, probably not too long ago, Miss Spreng ‘‘was quite
the little activist.” But now she doesn’t care. Instead of becoming ex-
cited or even curious, she writes, ‘(Maybe the only healthy policy is to
assume the best of everyone, and hope that eventually it does not
become necessary to believe the worst.”

We've been told that the purpose of a liberal arts education is to
make students think. It is supposed to expand our minds, not just our
future bank accounts. When we say that we don’t care about the facts,
that we’re not interested in the search for Truth or the truth, then we

are wasting our time.

I’m not writing this out of disdain or disrespect for Miss Spreng.
She’s active and intelligent. She writes well and is a budding star on

the W&L debate team.

I’m writing this because I’m afraid that many of our nation’s col-
leges are stuffing students’ heads with facts and figures instead of ex-
panding our minds. I’m afraid we’re maturing intellectually but not
mentally, becoming numb instead of inquisitive.

I’ve been told that I'd better not be disillusioned by this, that most of
the people in the ‘real world” are apathetic and ignorant. Having
worked as a professional reporter in that ‘‘real world,”’ I find it sadly
ironic that we who are privileged enough to receive $40,000 and $50,000
educations often are the most ignorant and the most apathetic.

That’s why I hope that three years from now, Miss Spreng will look
back on that first ‘‘My View’ and say ‘‘My, was I naive.”’ And that

~ — she’ll reread that third ‘‘My View” and slap her own wrist.

4 In her first column, Miss Spreng wrote that she saw herself as a
member of a community larger than just W&L, and that here she had
been instilled with a sense of responsibility. “W&L is creating

gentlepeople,’’ she wrote.

As gentlepeople, our primary responsbility is to become well-
informed, caring citizens. We must be defenders of the poor and the
needy, of the infants and the elderly, of the weak and the crippled. We

must fight for unity and equality.

Such was the vision of men like Robert E. Lee and Martin Luther
King, whose birthdays were celebrated earlier this week. These two
leaders did not influence the nation simply by whistling a happy tune.
They asked tough questions. They dreamed great dreams. And they
attempted to make those dreams come true.

So must we.

Bryan to speak on First Amendment

 

By MARGARET PIMBLETT
Staff Reporter

 

J. Stewart Bryan III, publisher of
the Richmond Times-Dispatch and
News Leader, will deliver a lecture
on First Amendment rights Monday
January 26, at 8 p.m. in Lee Chapel.

Bryan is the 1987 recipient of the
First Amendment Award, which is
given anually by the Washington and
Lee chapter of the Society of Profes-
sional Journalists, Sigma Delta Chi.

Bryan is being honored for his
leadership role in the Richmond
newspapers’ litigation that resulted
in a landmark decision by the United
StatesSupreme Court. The Richmond
Newspapers case established that
the closing of a criminal court trial in
the absence of overriding counter in-
terest was invalid under First and
Fourteenth Amendments.

That decision, involving the right
of the press and the public to attend
criminal trials, clarified issues that

were muddied by the uncertain lan-
guage of Gannett v. DePasquale that
resulted in a rash of more than 130
decisions granting court closure in a
twelve month period. The Richmond
Newspapers v. Virginia case involv-
ed a murder trial in the Circuit Court
of Hanover County.

Bryan graduated from the Univer-
sity of Virginia in 1960 with a B.A.
degree in philosophy. He began his
career in journalism after spending
two years with the U.S. Marine Cor-
ps. He served as a reporter for the
Tampa Times and the Richmond
Times-Dispatch until 1968 when he
was named vice-president of the
Tribune Company in Tampa.

He became executive vice-
president of the Tampa papers in
1971 and was named publisher in
1976. In 1978, Bryan became publish-
er of the two Richmond papers.
Elected to the board of directors of
Media General in 1974, Bryan was
named vice chairman in January
1985, and executive vice-president in
October 1985.

 

 

Bryan and W&L connection

The connection between
Washington and Lee University
and J. Stewart Bryan is not a
typical association. Bryan is not a
W&L alumnus, nor has he donated
huge sums of money to build a
gymnasium or endow a professor-
ship.

Bryan, who will deliver a lec-
ture on Monday, January 26 in
Lee Chapel, is the great-grandson
of Joseph and Isobel ‘‘Belle’’
Stewart Bryan.

According to information ob-
tained by Clark R. Mollenhoff,
professor of journalism, Belle
Stewart was a favorite companion
of Robert E. Lee and his family,
During the Civil War, General
Lee’s family had occupied a home
owned by Belle’s father. Belle re-
quested and received from Lee a
photograph, although he replied to
her in a note, ‘I am surprised,

Miss Belle, that you should want
the likeness of an old man when
you can get that of so many young
men, but...1 send the last I have. I
hope it may serve to recall
sometimes one who will never
forget you.”

After Bryan’s marriage to Belle
Stewart in 1871, Lee’s descendants
were frequent guests at the
Stewart family home, Laburnum,
in Richmond. Lee’s West Point
sword was displayed on the
mantel at Laburnum until it was
partially destroyed by a fire in
1906.

The W&L treasurer’s books for
1907-08 record the receipt from
Joseph Bryan of $97.26 for moun-
ting the bones of Traveller, the
general’s favorite horse.

talented program at Lylburn Down-
ing Middle School had some ques-
tions, but they weren’t quite sure how
to find the answers.

The sixth-grade students wanted to
know about students and school
policies. The seventh graders were
interested in extracurricular ac-
tivities for their age group. The pro-
blem, however, was how to create a
survey that reflected student opinion
and was scientifically accurate.

Enter Robert Merritt, a W&L
senior from Springfield, Virginia.

Twice a week for more than a
month, Merritt met with the students
in the gifted and talented program to
help them formulate the questions
for their surveys, write the computer
program for the surveys, and
tabulate the results. Since Merritt
received no academic credit for his
work, it was a labor of love.

“He really did all the back-
breaking work,”’ said Babs Sanders,
director of the gifted and talented
program who worked with Merritt on
the project. ‘‘He was a tremendous
help.”’

Merritt, a senior sociology/an-
thropology major, was recommend-
ed for the project by David Novack,
associate professor of sociology at
W&L. Novack thought Merritt’s ex-
perience with surveys done at
Washington and Lee and for a law
firm might be of use to the students.

By the time Merritt joined the pro-
ject, the students had already written
several questions for the survey.

 

 

 

 

Robert Merritt surrounded by gifted and talented students.

“We talked about theory and what
exactly they were trying to survey,”
Merritt said. “‘We cleaned up the
questions, then the students ad-
ministered the survey.”

Once the students received the
responses to the questions, they
began entering the 8,000 to 10,000
pieces of data at the W&L Computer
Center. Merritt said he was ‘“‘amaz-
ed’’ that the students were 99 percent
accurate in entering the data.

After all the data was entered,

Merritt used a computer program he
wrote to run frequencies and cross
tabulations to glean the results of the
survey. He explained the results to
the students who then developed
reports on what the surveys reveal-
ed.

Merritt said he got involved in the
project ‘‘just because I wanted to
help.’’ He said he ‘‘found the students
to be bright, cooperative, hard work-
ing and attentive.”’ :

“T was really impressed with their

work,”’ he said. “They did better
work than some college students I’ve
seen.”

Sanders, too, was impressed with
the students’ work and had praise tor
Merritt’s commitment to making the
project a success.

“He had a nice way with the
students,’ Sanders said. ‘‘He ex-
plained each step to the students and
why it was necessary to complete one
step before moving on to another. It
was a great experience for all of us.”’

Constitutional Convention will soon begin

By HOLLY WILLIAMS
Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee University
will hold a constitutional convention
to commemorate the bicentennial of
the U.S. Constitution. The event,
which will take place on May 2, 1987,
is the result of more than a year and
a half of study of possible ways to
celebrate the anniversary of the
writing of the Constitution.

Recognizing the University’s his-

toric ties to the Constitution, John D.
Wilson, president of the University,
initiated the examination process by
appointing a planning committee of
professors and students in the fall of
1985. Trustees of the Liberty Hall
Academy were instrumental in the
ratification of the Constitution at the
Virginia State Ratifying Convention
in 1788. In addition, George Washing-
ton, president of the Convention, was
one of the original benefactors of
W&L, and the school is named in
recognition of his generosity.

Although an Article V national con-
vention, the alternative to Congress’s
amending of the Constitution has not
taken place in our history, W&L’s
convention is relevant because 32 out
of the necessary 34 states have peti-
tioned Congress to call a national
convention to consider a balanced
budget amendment.

Amendments proposed through a
national convention must be ratified
by three quarters of the states before
they become part of the Constitution.

The planning committee for the

mock convention has been broken in-
to subcommittees working on rules
and issues, operations, finance,
media, and entertainment. State
chairmen have been appointed for
each state, and lists of their names
are posted around campus. It is not
too late to join a delegation. Peter
Bennorth, chairman of the Mock Con-
stitutional Convention said, ‘‘This is
going to have to be a student project
in order to be successful.”

Last December, Paul Youngman
faced a problem that had already
become familiar to him in the last
year: the unenviable task of handling
seriously intoxicated students.

Youngman, a senior from Rochest-
er, N.Y., and assistant head dormi-
tory counselor, said that since he
became a dorm counselor as a junior,
he’s had to handle such situations
four times.

“The first time I had to deal with
such a situation was last year in the
fall. There was a girl laid out in front
of Graham-Lees dormitory, uncon-
scious, and a number of obviously
drunk guys were standing around
her, unsure of what to do,” said
Youngman.

“One of the guys and myself car-
ried her to her fourth-floor dorm
room and left her there, figuring
she'd recover from the alcohol. But a
few hours later, I learned she had to
go to the hospital due to respiratory
problems, which really shook me
up.

Youngman said she recorded a
blood alcohol level much higher than
the “legally drunk’’ level of .10 per-
cent. Since then, he says he’s been

“overcautious’’ in handling those he
suspects of being extremely intox-
icated.

“The first incident was quite a
scare, when I thought about what
could’ve happened to her. Since then,
I’ve tried to be more careful about
handling such incidents, even if it
means calling the hospital.”

After the original incident,
Youngman encountered the problem
twice more at the dorms, each time
taking precautions so that the intox-
icated person was in no danger. It
was not until last Christmas that he
had to handle a similar situation out-
side of the dorms.

“During our fraternity Christmas
party, one of the pledges got ex-
tremely drunk, and was in pretty bad
shape. It soon became evident that he
needed more help than anyone in the
fraternity could offer, so I called the
hospital,’ Youngman said.

Youngman said that, though he felt
pressured not to call the hospital, an-
continue the ‘Pie-throw,’ ’’ an event
Foundation; Camille Miller, an in-
structor in sociology at W&L; and
to be done. ‘‘There wasn’t any way
we could help the student, and
everyone realized the day after that
it was for the better that he went to
the hospital.”

“I’m no angel myself when it
comes to drinking,” Youngman said,

‘“‘but I know my own limits from ex-
perience. Many of the freshmen
come to school not knowing their
limits, and these are the students
who need watching. Given a party en-
vironment, it’s understandable that
they might get carried away with
alcohol.”’

“However, most of the cases of in-
toxication are less serious, and if we
give the kid a lot of grief about his
drunken condition, he is usually less
apt to go out and do the same thing
again,’’ he added. :

Although Youngman thinks that
the recent change in the drinking age
is “somewhat ridiculous, given its
assumption that an 18-year-old can-
not be trusted to control himself,” he
believes that recent university
pressure on fraternities to enforce
the laws is warranted.

“Given their liability with regard
to alcohol-related accidents involv-
ing fraternities, the university is ina
position where it must obey the
laws,’’ Youngman said.

Have fraternities responded posi-
tively to this pressure? “For the
most part, yes,’ Youngman said.
“Though naturally there is bound to
be some resentment, fraternities are
taking steps in the right direction
toward regulating alcohol consump-
tion at parties, a move that is well-
founded.”’

Slave auction will raise
money for Superdance

By TOM BRICKEL
Staff Reporter

 

The February 7-8 Superdance, an
18-hour fundraiser for the Muscular
Dystrophy Association, has already
raised in excess of $2,500 due to the
efforts of slaves, said Superdance co-
chairman Jim Barker.

Barker was referring to two “‘Slave
Auctions’ recently held at Hollins
and Sweet Briar colleges. These auc-
tions, in which people donate their
time to be ‘auctioned’ off as
“slaves,” and are consequently
“sold” to the highest bidder, have
been successful this year, netting the
Muscular Dystrophy Association ap-
proximately $2,550.

“They (the slave auctions) have
been more successful than we’d ever
imagined possible,” said Barker.
“The auction at Hollins brought in
about $1,800, surpassing the total of
all the auctions held last year. This,
combined with the recent auction at
Sweet Briar, and with the future auc-
tions planned, makes this a banner
year for the event.”’

An auction at Randolph-Macon

Woman’s College is scheduled for
Thursday, January 22.

Slave auctions are an especially ef-
fective part of the Superdance fund-
raiser, for they provide not only an
enjoyable activity for those who want
to help the Superdance effort, but
they promote the event as well.

“The publicity that accompanies
our auctions has a measurable im-
pact on Superdance participation,
especially as concerns the local
women’s colleges,’’ continued
Barker. ‘‘While we have members of
the student recruitment committee
(for the dance) visit local schools and
recruit dancers, the auctions are par-
ticularly effective for the relatively
short period each auction takes.”’

The slave auctions are one of the
many responsibilities of the special
events committee, headed this year
by senior Tom Knight and junior
Greg Knapp. With the exception of
entertainment provided by the
bands, and the time alloted to prize
giveaways, the special events com-
mittee is primarilly responsible for
keeping the dancers busy during the
less active periods of the day.

Pact activities have run the gamut
from the demanding spoon races, to
the physically grueling ‘Simon
Says” with Coach Lord.

‘“‘And,’’ Barker said, ‘‘we hope to
continue the ‘Pie-throw’’ an event
that’s been popular in the past.” This
will be contingent on faculty and ad-
ministration participation. Past par-
ticipants have included former Com-
merce School Dean Atwood, Pro-
fessor Simpson and Coach Miller.

Until the February 7 dance arrives,
the school will have to wait to see
what the special events committee
has planned. A slave auction at W&L
is ‘‘tentative at this point,”’ according
to Knapp. “It will depend not only on
whether there are enough prospec-
tive ‘slaves’ willing to donate their
time, but also if there are enough
people interested in ‘acquiring’
them,” he said.

“‘We’ve tentatively planned on hav-
ing one in the GHQ on Wednesday,
Jan. 28. Although nothing is definite,
given the current interest in the
event, we’re hoping W&L will see a
slave auction this year,” Knapp con-
cluded.

Women’s stress forum scheduled .

Staff Reports

Today more women than ever
struggle to cope with the dual
demands of job and home. The stress
of trying to balance what amounts to
two full-time careers has resulted in
an increase in depression in women
and, in some cases, job burnout. In
an effort to bring these and other
issues closer to home, three local
women have organized a day-long
conference to examine the state of
women’s lives.

“Women Looking Ahead: Pay-
checks, Politics, and Pampers’’ will
be held Saturday, February 28 from
8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. in Room 327 of
W&L’s School of Commerce, Econo-
mics, and Politics.

Co-ordinators for the conference
are Melanie Fure, director of events
at the Virginia Military Institute
Foundation, Camille Miller, an in-
structor in sociology at W&L; and
Lisa Solod, a writer and director of
public information for the Marshall
Foundation. The conferences is sup-

The dart might have gone in deeper
had it not hit the seam of the teen’s
denim jacket. She also was wearing a
heavy sweater.

Dean of Students Lewis G. John
said the case had been referred to the
Student Conduct Committee but that
no decisions had been made. Atkins
shaid he would not consider taking
any legal action until after that com-
mittee had ruled on the case.

He stressed that he wanted the Stu-

 

 

ported through grants from W&L,
Bank of Rockbridge, First American
Bank, and Dominion Bank. Addition-
al support is being provided by
United Virginia Bank, American
Federal Savings and Loan, and
Southern Seminary Junior College.

‘“‘We are all dealing with the issues
associated with managing both
homes and careers and we know that
there are other women in the com-
munity who face similar problems,”
Fure said. When we first conceived
the idea of the conference a little over
a year ago, we thought it would be a
good way to discuss our mutual pro-
blems and try to better educate our-
selves in ways to solve them. We
thought the conference would be a
good way to get women involved ona
local level.”’

Sybil Todd, associate dean at the
University of Virginia and an author
whose specialty is women’s issues,
will deliver the keynote address. In
her address, entitled ‘‘Women’s
Evolving Paths,”’ Todd will examine
the ways in which women are follow-

dent Conduct Committee to base its
decision on the fact that Sampson
was endangering people by shooting
the dart, not because that dart hit his
daughter. He said it would be wrong
for people to assume that because the
girl was related to him, that it would
be handled differently from any
other incident.

Sampson said the blowgun was a
gift from a girlfriend. It is legal to
possess, but Sampson turned it over
to Murray on Friday.

Freshmen are not allowed to keep
firearms in the dorms, John said.
They are supposed to be held by Dean
of Freshmen H. Robert Huntley. As a
result of the incident, John said he
hoped the firearms policy would in-
clude blowguns too.

KING

 

O Continued from Page 1

But other local governments are
still wrestling over the merit of yet
another official holiday in honor of a
national hero. States and cities have
the option of deciding whether to
observe a federal holiday by closing
schools and state government of-
fices.

Arizona’s new governor, Evan
Mecham, canceled the state holiday
to honor King, fulfilling a campaign
promise to rescind the executive
order issued by his predecessor, Gov.
Bruce Babbitt, that created a paid
holiday for state employees. The new
Republican governor said Babbitt,
who is a Democrat, had no authority
to create such a holiday. Backers of
the holiday have bitterly criticized
Mecham’s proposal that the issue be
put to a public vote.

Citizens in Tupelo, Miss., and An-

chorage, Alaska, are engaged in dif-
ficult struggles to have streets
renamed for King. In Slidell, La.,
black residents won the right to hold
a parade through the downtown sec-
tion, but they are now struggling to
win ‘“‘some respect’’ from the white
community, some members of
which, they say, view the day as a
“holiday for black people.”’

Many civil rights leaders fear that
such a perception is widespread and
say the holiday ought to be more than
a time for celebration.

“T cautioned the country that it’s
one thing to struggle for a national
holiday, and another thing to cele-
brate it appropriately, and yet still
another to maintain its integrity over
the years,’’ said Coretta Scott King,
King’s widow. ‘“‘We must continue to
be on guard against those who would
make the holiday a black holiday.”

Those who strove to establish a day
in King’s honor acknowledged that it
would take years to institutionalize
the holiday. They noted that 10
states, including Montana, Texas and
North Carolina, have not yet estab-

Abraham’s speech, titled ‘“‘Our En-
during and Evolving Constitution:
Some Reflections,’’ was one of a
series of events celebrating the
bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution.

After listing 13 basic assumptions
that underlie the commitment to con-
stitutionalism, Abraham continued
with some ‘‘Musings On the federal
structures of our system, one that
has indeed been a model for a
number of healthy and less healthy
new and old states abroad.’’ He ex-
amined the relationships between
states’ rights and the federal system,
and cited ‘historical reasons that
prompted the question to become
that of ‘will the component parties-
i.e. the statessurvive’ in the
American system.”’

Abraham also talked about the role
of the judicial system and “its
presumed parameters of power and
authority.,’ He said the question and
problem of the judicial system is how
to ‘‘Harness the judicial role within
its appropriate bounds”’ and to keep
it from becoming a policy maker.

lished such a holiday

Virginia observes a holiday Jan. 15
for Southern heroes, and King is
honored along with such Confederate
heroes as Robert E. Lee and Stone-
wall Jackson.

Some states let employees take the
day off without pay or in exchange
for a paid holiday. Others merely en-
courage employees to take note of
King’s work that day.

Nevertheless, members of the
Martin Luther King Jr. Federal Holi-
day Commission, which was estab-
lished to organize the celebrations,
say they take pride in having been
able to accomplish some degree of
unanimity ina relatively short time.

“‘T think people may be overlooking
the fact that it takes years to institu-
tionalize a national holiday,’ said
Lloyd Davis, executive director of
the commission. ‘‘The observance
for July Fourth didn’t peak until the
1800s. And given that it took George
Washington 80 years to get a holiday,
Columbus 176 years and Lincoln
never made it, it’s rather miraculous
that King received such an honor in

Radio
coverage

By TOM BRICKEL

“T intend to be dancing when I’m
not in the studio,’’ said Mac Gibson,
music director for WLUR-FM. Gib-
son was referring to WLUR coverage
of the February 7-8 Superdance for
the Muscular Dystrophy Association.

The idea for event-long coverage of
the Superdance was conceived of
four years ago by WLUR staff mem-
bers Bob Halloran and Taylor Hath-
away. Mike Stachura and Cotton
Puryear continued the tradition, re-
maining on the air for 30 hours, the
length of previous Superdances.

Coverage for this year’s Super-
dance, as has been the case in the
past, is extensive: with the exception
of a few hours Saturday afternoon,
the station will again cover the entire
Superdance. There is one difference
this year, however, in that disc
jockeys covering it will get some
sleep.

“We'll be covering the dance in
shifts Superdance weekend,” said
Gibson, who, along with station news
director Tim McMahon, will be in
charge of organizing the coverage.
“They'll rotate in three-hour shifts,
perhaps spending two more hours on
location in the pavilion. Trying to
stay awake will-most likely not be a
problem this-year.”’

The radio rock-a-thon will serve
two purposes this year, according to
Gibson. “Our most important pur-
pose is to raise money for MDA.

18 years.’’ Lincoln’s birthday tech-
nically is not a federal holiday.

When a bill proposing a holiday for
King reached Congress in 1983, op-
ponents led by Jessee Helms, the con-
servative Republican senator from
North Carolina, sought to block it.
President Regan initially opposed
creating another holiday, saying the
nation could not afford to honor all its
heroes. But the measure was passed
by Congress amid heated debate as
the 10th paid holiday for federal
workers. Regan then signed the holi-
day into law

The King day is the first new na-
tional holiday to be proclaimed by
Congress since Thanksgiving was of-
ficially adopted in 1941. King, who
won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, is
the first American to be honored with
a holiday of his own since Washing-
ton,

Many black leaders agree that so
many years after King’s death the
civil rights movement is still trying
to achieve what he was seeking: a
way to bring poor blacks into econo-
mic security and to end racial in-

A bulldozer stands ready beside duPont Hall as the

justice. His widow, who established
the Martin Luther King Center for
Non-Violent Social Change in Atlanta
to carry out his work, acknowledged
that while she has sought to ac-
complish his goals, neither she nor
other rights leaders have succeeded.

King was standing on a balcony of
the Lorraine Motel in Memphis,
Tenn., on April 4, 1968, when he was
shot to death by a sniper, James Earl
Ray. Had King lived, he would have
been 58 last Thursday. Ray was sen-
tenced to life in prison.

Much like the rights movement
that King symbolized, the second na-
tional holiday observances honoring
him will be long on enthusiasm and
short on money. The federal commis-
sion coordinating the ceremonies has
fallen short of its fund-raising goal of
$250,000 for this year; as of Friday,
Jan. 16, it had raised about $100,000.

Bob Dole of Kansas, the leader of
the Senate’s Republican minority,
was among those leading the lobby
on Capitol Hill to create the holiday.
At a news conference last week he ex-
pressed dismay over the lack of sup-

port.

Davis, the federal commission of-
ficial, concedes that he is disap-
pointed that there will no star-
studded television special for King
like the one produced last year by
Stevie Wonder, the entertainer, for
NBC. Instead, the network will
televise the 19th annual Image
Awards program of the National
Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, to honor individuals
and companies that contribute ‘‘posi-
tive images’”’ of black people.

“But that’s not the end-all,”’ Davis
said. “It is essentially a holiday to in-
crease public awareness about Dr
King and his work.

Leaders of the holiday events say
they have generated wide and en-
thusiastic support from a diverse
grouping in this country and abroad.
More than 20 nations have indicated
they will participate in the holiday
with events in their countries or by
sending representatives to the United
States to participate in events in
Washington and Atlanta and at the
United Nations.

tainable,”’ according to Gibson.

“This is the reason we'll be on the
air 20 hours instead of the 18 hours
this year’s dance will run. Hopefully,
we'll begin it all at 6 a.m. that morn-
ing — if I’m able to get up,” Gibson
joked.

Because of a contract requiring the
station to carry opera on “Live from
the Met’’ weekly, the dance will not
be broadcast between 2 and 5 p.m.
“The dance should not lose any
money over this,’ said Gibson, ‘‘as
Spiedel, Goodrich, and Lille will be

 

playing during those hours.”

Beginning at 6 a.m. Saturday,
coverage will end at 2 a.m. Sunday
morning. WLUR broadcasts at 91.5
on the FM dial. Anybody wishing to
make a request or a dedication can
call the station at 463-8444.

“Hopefully, our listeners will help
us reach our goal by keeping the
phones busy. Not only will it benefit
the MDA, but it will keep our DJ’s
from getting lonely as well,” con
cluded Gibson.

Generals win big, &

out look

ty MIKE SHADY
\ssistant Sports Editor

 

 

A twenty point victory would
itisfy most people, but not a perfec-
onist like Verne Canfield.

‘It was a sloppy game,” said head
oach Canfield Tuesday night, after
Vashington and Lee basketball team
efeated Eastern Mennonite 80-60 in
ie Warner Center. ‘‘I don’t think you
hould be satisfied with that kind of
ffort.’’

The win left W&L with an even-
teven 3-3 record in the Old Dominion
thletic Conference after a 70-55 vic-
wry over Maryville on Saturday and
n 81-58 defeat at the hands of arch-
val Roanoke College last Thursday.

The Generals had difficulty putting
way an overmatched Eastern Mon-
nite. W&L committed an astound-
g 22 personal fouls over the entire
illgame and sent the Royals to the
1e 30 times. Despite these dif-
tulties, the General’s led at
ilftime 37-28.

‘We weren't sharp as a team,”
id freshman Wes Boyd. ‘It was
finitely a struggle both offensively
ddefensively.”’

“We didn’t play with intensity or
nacity,”’ said Canfield. ‘‘We played
lyin spurts "

Canfield’s assesment was correct
; the Generals appeared to almost

sloppy

coast at times. The game was clearly
a case of W&L being a far superior
team in terms of talent, but they
were unable to capitalize on the 19
turnovers that Eastern Mennonite
handed them.

“There were a lot of two-on-one
situations that we didn’t convert and
that’s just a mental thing,”’ said Can-
field.

Senior Jefferson Harralson and
sophomore Lee Brading had 15 and 14
points respectively and senior Fred
Bissinger chipped in 10 points. It was
the third consecutive game in which
the high-scoring Harralson was held
to less than his 22 point per game
average.

Against the Maryville Scots, the
Generals turned up the “D” and
caused Maryville to cough up the pill
23 times, the most telling and in-
strumental statistic from the win.

“It was a good defensive game,”
said Canfield. ‘“The defense got going
and took away their offense com-
pletely.”’

Junior Steve Hancock scored 17
points, nine of them coming from the
charity stripe. He received assis-
tance from Harralson (11 points) and
Brading (10 points) as well as 10
points from the always ready junior
Lou Trosch.

At times, Maryville had trouble

Remillard said that his scouting
reports showed that the Red Raiders
had weekly drops in time this season,
as well as improvements over times
from last year. Unknown to the
Generals, however, was the second
semester eligibility of three of their
top swimmers, who had not shown up
on any earlier reports. Sophomore
captain Moose Herring said that
walking into the pool area was “‘like
walking into a bees’ nest.’ The
capacity crowd did not make things
any easier.

Bolstered by the fast times of the
three new team members, the Red
Raiders jumped to an early lead and

never looked back until they had set a
new pool record in the final event, the
400-yard freestyle relay. The men,
who had not competed since the vic-
tory over VMI on November 12, lost
100-75.

Remillard said that the Ship-
pensburg team ‘‘swam well, and our
swims were not great, but certainly
not bad.”’ He went on to say that the
times reflect well the stage of train-
ing the swimmers are currently in,
and he added that ‘‘at this time, our
mid-season times are faster than any
in history, and, except for a couple of
top times, faster than at the end of
the season last year.”’

Surprise swimmers on W&L

On Saturday, the 25-meter pool at
Georgetown, in Washington D.C.,
was dominated by Washington and

3-1, defeating Frostburg State 68-40
and host Georgetown 65-43. Remil-

that occurred on Friday were cor-

capable of ‘‘fewer surprises allowed
us to shuffle our line-up,’ he said,

that “could prove valuable later’on.”’

‘he Washington and Lee Wrestling
m had some anxious moments
» weekend. After travelling all the
y to Annville, Pa., the team was
ndly beaten in its first meet, but
ounded to take the consolation
cket and place fifth, thanks in
tito some last minute lineup shuf-
g.

‘his past weekend at the Lebanon
‘ley Tournament, W&L lost in the
t round 38-3 to Lycoming. The
m, however, came back to win the
t of its matches, thumping Baptist
le, 47-5, and edging Muhlenberg,
‘1, with an assist from some late
ching moves.

1 the finals of the consolation
nd against Muhlenberg, the
teh was tied at 15 with only the 177
the 190 lb., and the Heavyweight
ches to go.

Sophmore Rich Redfoot, who had
already won both his matches in the
previous rounds, faced Muhlenberg’s
Al Flowers in the 177 lb. match. Red-
foot pinned flowers in 2:18 to give the
Generals a 21-15 lead.

That’s when W&L head coach Gary
Franke began the maneuvering.

In wrestling the home team (in this
case Muhlenberg) must put its
wrestler on the mat first, and once
they do, they can’t withdraw him.
Since Muhlenberg had weighed two
wrestlers at 190 Ibs., the Generals
didn’t know’ which wrestler
Muhlenberg would show at 190 Ibs.

“We didn’t have a Heavyweight
with us on the trip,”’ said Franke.
This meant that W&L would have to
forfeit either the 190 Ib. match or the
heavyweight match.

“We waited until they [Muhlen-
berg] put their 190 pounder on the
mat,” said Franke. “We felt that
{sophomore George] Loupassi [who
weighed in at 190 Ibs., making him
eligible for either the 190 Ib. class or

 

 

 

 

Chris Coffland

the heavyweight class] had a better
chance against the wrestler
Muhlenberg was going with at heavy-
weight so we forfeited at 190 lbs.””

The forfeit tied the score at 21, but
Loupassi went on to beat
Muhlenberg’s Gary Franceschi 9-0 to
complete W&L’s 25-21 win that gave
them fifth place as the consolation
bracket winners.

But despite the exciting last match,
Franke felt that the team might have
lacked some emotion in the first

round loss to Lycoming.
“They [Lycoming] out-hustled
us,” said Franke. ‘Maybe we

weren’t prepared emotionally.”

“‘We were beaten badly in the team
score,” said Franke, “but the in-
dividual match scores were fairly
close.”’

As previously mentioned, Redfoot
was W&L’s lone winner in the
Lycoming match, beating Bryan
Neidigh 5-4. That match was tied at
the end of regulation time, but Red-
foot was awarded one point by virtue

of having a greater riding time than
Neidigh.

Franke said he the team ‘‘wrestled
better” in the second round, when
they demolished Baptist Bible 47-5.

This Saturday the Generals defend
their title in the W&L Invitaional
Tournament against Barber-Scotia,
Davidson, Elon, Longwood, Hamden-
Sydney, and Furman.

According to Franke, The Generals
will have no easy time of it on Satur-
day. ‘‘Due to graduation, I don’t
think that we have the depth we had
last year.”’ He said he feels that Elon
and Longwood are the teams to beat.

Additionally complicating matters
is the condition of Redfoot, the only
General to win all three of his match-
es last weekend at Lebanon Valley.
Redfoot did not practice on Wednes-
day because of the flu.

“Tf he’s not there it could make a
difference,” said Franke. ‘‘We’re
hoping he’ll be O.K. by the tourna-
ment.”

performance of the week-end.’ He
cited the personal best times of both
sophomore Nancy Whalen and fresh-
men Debbie Grove in the 400m
freestyle, as well as others. He also
mentioned that more ‘Top Five’
times were recorded this weekend
than ever before. The ‘Top Five,’ he
explained, is a list of the five fastest
times in all events swum by team
members this year. Getting onto the
list is the kind of incentive that keeps
many team members competitive,
even in workout.

Both teams travel again this
weekend, with both the men and

Remillard said that ‘‘conscientious
adjustments had been made in this
week’s work-outs in order to produce
improved swims and allow for eval-
uation of training techniques.’ As a
coach he says he ‘‘is optimistic,” and
“wants to keep going faster.’’ He
feels that the shoot-out against
Hopkins will be very close as usual.
Junior Darrin Denny mirrored this
saying that the team ‘“‘has had some

are coming. Friday will be one of
them.”’

Coffland still awaiting a ruling from NCAA

 

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Assignments Editor

 

For William D. McHenry,
waiting game continues.

Washington and Lee’s director of
athletics still has not received a rul-
ing from the National Collegiate
Athletic Association on the eligibility
of football running back Chris Cof-
fland.

McHenry had hoped to hear from
the NCAA by Jan. 1.

The NCAA ruled Coffland ineligible
in November because he was not
registered for 12 credits during the
fall term.

Immediately following the surprise
ruling, McHenry asked all W&L
athletic coaches to make sure that
their athletes were taking 12

the

academic credits each term. Wrestl-
ing co-captain Jeff Mazza, a senior
from Bayshore, N.Y., was not allow-
ed to wrestle for W&L during fall
term because he was taking an
underload, McHenry said. Mazza is
now taking a full academic load and
has been wrestling all winter.

Mazza was the only other athlete
directly affected by the Coffland
decision, which was immediately ap-
pealed by W&L.

The dispute is a result of W&L’s
unusual academic calendar, which is
now being reviewed by the NCAA’s
Academic Requirements Committee,
McHenry said. Once that committee
is done, then the NCAA Eligibility
Committee may rule on Coffland’s
case.

W&L’s non-traditional academic
calender consists of two terms
lasting 12 weeks. The third lasts six.

Because of the calendar, W&L stu
dents take fewer credit-hours per
term than students at other schools.

NCAA bylaw 5-1-C requires that a
student-athlete be registered in a
minimum of 12 semester or quarter
hours, ‘‘or a similar minimum acade-
mic load as determined by the NCAA
Eligibility Committee in an institu-
tion that determines registration
other than on a traditional semester
or quarter-hour basis or conducts a
cooperative educational program.”’

A normal academic load at W&L is
12 to 14 credits, inclusive, per 12-
week term. Any amount below that is
considered an underload.

Coffland, a junior from Baltimore,
was registered for 10 credits. W&L
considered him a full-time student
because he was taking more than
nine credits. But the NCAA applied
its 12-hour requirement to his fall

i

term, making him ineligible

A 5’ 10’, 160 Ib. slotback, Coffland
was not allowed to play in W&L’s
final two games this season, although
a shoulder injury would have sidelin

ed him anyway, McHenry said
said

Coffland has been named a tri
captain of next year’s football squad
He is also a midfielder on W&L’s
lacrosse team

The ruling will not affect Coffland’s
lacrosse eligibility, but he could be
forced to sit out between two and
seven football games next year if the
appeal is denied, McHenry said

The Academic Requirements Com-
mittee’s decision is not expected to
affect W&L’s calendar, McHenry
said, but it could force W&L athletes

to take a Minimum number of credit

Shades on sports
by Mike Shady

Assistant Sports Editor

More W&L teams
means less play

I know a lot of guys who are extremely ticked off right now. Call ’em
“the Basketball Bunch.’’ I was a member of this elite, talented (ex-
cept for me), and yet somewhat undisciplined gang of hoopsters who
used to (notice the past tense) play in the old gym weekdays at around
3:30. Those games were sometimes awesome displays of running and
gunning, just ten fellas out having a whale of a good time. And then...

The Washington and Lee Athletic Department comes strolling by
and drops the big whammy on our “‘club.’”” Women’s volleyball, a
developmental varsity team, had decided to venture into our reign and
taken over control of the gym. Whoa, hold the phone. Women’s
volleyball???!!!! Hey, isn’t that something they show late night on
ESPN sandwiched between Speedweek and The Fishin’ Hole?

Well, it is. But the question isn’t whether or not W&L should field a
volleyball team, but rather what’s going to happen when women’s
athletics shifts into fifth gear. A nice advantage of coming to a small
liberal arts college is the availability of its sports facilities. Whenever
you needed a court, be it basketball, raquetball, tennis, or (ugh) even
squash (isn’t that a vegetable? ), one was almost right at hand.

But no more. Coeducation has ushered in a new era. Cross country,
swimming, and tennis have already been established as varsity
sports, and soccer, volleyball and basektball are not far behind. I
shudder just thinking about how difficult it will be to find court time
with two basketball teams instead of just one.

But what do we do? Unfortunately, the women will probably take
much of the blame. ‘‘We are concerned that the women are going to
have to bear most of the complaints,” said Assistant Athletic Director
Cinda Rankin.

You can scream, bitch, and moan about the women taking over and
receiving special treatment, but this just ain’t so. Women’s sports are
an inevitable and extremely nice addition to the W&L mainstream. So,
we recreational players will have to wait just that little bit longer for
the facilities. Big deal. In this case, the plusses far outweigh the
minusses.

So goodbye, Basketball Bunch. See ya later, Jim, Kev, Ron, Ski,
Dave, Jeff and whoever I forgot. Thanks for the good times, and
maybe we'll do it again next year.

Richard Redfoot

Phi’s first choice

Staff Reporter

 

Sophomore Richard Redfoot,
Washington and Lee’s 177 Ib.
wrestler, has been selected as the
first Ring-tum Phi W&L Athiete of
the Week for his performance in
quadrangular and dual meets this
past week.

Redfoot went through both
meets with a record of 6-0 pinning
one of his opponents, receiving a
technical decision against another
and defeating the others on points,
an effort definitely deserving
praise.

He is 9-2 for the season with one
of his losses coming at the hands
of a preseason all-America can-
didate and the other by a wrestler
whom he defeated earlier but
later lost to because of an injured
knee that hampered his perfor-
mance.

Redfoot

Redfoot said that he feels confi-
dent this season and hopes he can
make it to the national finals in
March.

He also has high hopes for the
team, which is currently 5-2.

“We had injuries early in the
season that hurt us,’’ said Red-
foot, “‘but now everyone is healthy
and the whole team should be in
good shape for the regional
finals.”’

The regionals will be held at
Washington and Lee the weekend
of February 20-22.

When he isn’t wrestling Redfoot
looks after his ferrets, Meegan
and McKinsey.

Redfoot is from Cocharnton,
Pa., where he wrestled, played
football, and volleyball for
Cocharton High School.

 

 

Indoor track to begin this weekend

 

By JIM LAKE
Staff Reporter

 

The 1987 Washington and Lee in-
door track team will open its season
this weekend at the Virginia Tech In-
vitational. According to head coach
Norris Aldridge, the Generals will be
represented by seven athletes in the
meet, with the rest of the squad
waiting until next weekend to begin
competition in pursuit of W&L’s
eleventh consecutive winning season
in indoor track.

This year’s team will feature five
former Old Dominion Conference
champions, ineluding senior John

Burlingame, who won the conference
title in the long jump last season.
Senior Thomas Murray won the shot
put in last year’s conference meet,
and senior Matthew Steilberg will try
for his second conference champion-
ship in the pole vault. Junior Andrew
White will attempt to repeat as con-
ference champion in the 55 meter
hurdles. Senior Kevin Weaver was on
last year’s conference championship
400 meter relay team. Murray,
Steilberg, White, and Weaver are
also former conference champions in
their respective events in outdoor
track, with White holding school
records in both the 110 and 400 meter
hurdles.

Aldridge says that the Generals will
have five athletes competing in the
pole vault, including Steilberg, senior
John Cardner, and juniors Joseph
Fisher and Robert Williamson. The
shot put will feature two excellent
throwers, Murray and sophomore
James Ambrosini. Sophomore Fray
McCormick will compete in the high
jump, and Burlingame, Andrew
White, and junior John White will
represent W&L in the long jump. The
triple jump will feature junior Nor-
man Sigler.

The Generals should also be strong
in the distance events, with junior
Richard Moore returning as the
team’s top distance runner. Sopho-

more Jamie Urso, who won a gold
medal in last year’s outdoor cham-
pionship meet, will compete in the
800 meter run. Moore, seniors Ash
Andrews and Steven Pockrass, and
junior Scott Rippeon will represent
the Generals in the 1500 and 5000
meter runs.

Aldridge says that last year’s
squad ‘“‘might have been the best
team I’ve ever had.’’ Although he
says that the nucleus of that team re-
mains, depth may be a problem for
the Generals in some events, in-
cluding the sprints and hurdles and
some field events.

The Generals’ head coach says that
he plans to enter all his athletes in
next Saturday’s VMI Relays.

‘American Tail’ triumphs;
‘Golden Child’ tarnished

BOMB A waste of Time and Money.

If you are a doubter of magic, An
American Tail will make you a
believer. Not because it is about
magic, but because it will take you
back to your childhood; back to the
times when you laughed at Pin-
nochio, you worried about Uncle
Remus, and you cried for Old Yeller
Steven Spielberg has once again cap-
tured that same magic that grabbed
us as children and refused to let us
g0. That Disney magic.

An American Tail opens in 1885
Shostka, Russia, as Fievel
Mouskawitz and his family talk idly
about the possibilities of making it in
the United States. When their village
is destroyed by the Cossacks, their
dreams turn into neccessity. The
family travels to Hamburg where
they find a ship heading to the United
States. Quickly they board and set off

turns to sorrow quickly though
Feivel, always curious and in awe of
all the world’s surprises is knocked of
the ship by a giant wave while trying
to see all the big fish in the ocean. By
chance, Feivel floats in an empty bot-
tle to the shore of Ellis Island where
he is befriended by Henre, the
French bird that built the Statue of
Liberty. Henre advises Feivel to
“never say never’’ and assures him
that he will find his parents.

The film progresses through a
series of mishaps with Feivel just
missing his parents in three or four
occurences. Not until he inadvertent
ly meets Tiger, a vegetarian feline
(Dom DeLuise’s voice) is he able to
be reunited with his family. Alright.
Yes, this movie is totally animated
and has Disney trademarks such as
an active score full of singing
animals, characters that believe only
in love and hope, and a happy ending.
For those of you that think you are
too old to go to a movie like this,
you're wrong. It is very entertaining
and a lot of fun. Dom DeLuise does a
wonderful job as Tiger, the cat with
the Cowardly Lion complex (i.e. Bert
Lahr). Likewise, Phillip Glasser
gives Fievel the life and sensitivity
that makes you automatically love
him the first time you see him.

While Feivel and Tiger are not like-
ly to get Oscar nominations, this film
will not be left out altogether. The

to their new home with anticipation
of a land ‘ith ne este Happiness

theme of An American Tail, called
“Somewhere Out There,” is reminis-

cent of the Disney classic ‘‘When You
Wish Upon A Star”’ and should get 2.n
Academy nomination for Best Sung
to go along with the one it has already
received from the Golden Globes
This is a wonderful film and one
that anyone who loves Disneyesgue
animation should see. Wherever Walt
Disney is, I kow he’s smiling

WHAKKKK KKK

Eddie Murphy’s anxiously awaited
fantasy film, The Golden Child, is
plain and simply, disappointing
Granted, it’s not easy to follow three
us uKe 48 Hours, ‘Irading Places,
and Beverly Hills Cop, but this film is
just not in the same class. It’s
mediocre and no where close to vin
tage Murphy.

The comic dialogue is moderately
funny, the special effects are o.k. and
the plot imposes numerous
unanswered questions. Murphy does
a good job as the Los Angeles finder
of lost children who is hired to find
the Tibetian miracle child of the title,
but it is clear that many lines are in-
serted just for a laugh. Too often
though, Murphy is the only one who
laughs.

This film won’t win any awards,
but it is enjoyable. For any die-hard
Eddie Murphy fans, The Golden
Child should tide you over until
Beverly Hills Cop II is released in
May. It not, rent a video,

Last night, the General Headquarters featured two local rock bands to a packed

The Poetics have released a song called ‘‘Hermitage’”’ produced by R.E.M. bassist
Mike Mills, and an album is forthcoming. GHQ Manager Bill Torrence said last
night’s attendance was much better than usual. As far as the whole year is concern-

Big Audio Dynamite is baad >

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Entertainment Editor

 

Big Audio Dynamite is two parts
hip-hop, three parts rock and roll,
four parts imagination and about six
parts brilliant. Our something like
that.

Big Audio Dynamite is Mick Jones’
Medicine Show: a Rock n’ Rap
Review where Eddie Cochran rubs
elbows with Run D.M.C. and the
Clash share a smoke with Prince. It’s
a place where politics bounce off
beatboxes and guitars accentuate the
positive.

When Mick Jones was kicked out of
the Clash, he certainly didn’t wait
around for his unemployment check.
With B.A.D., Jones takes the dub and
reggae experiments the Clash toyed
with on “Sandinista!’’ and pushes
them to their logical limit.

Big Audio Dynamite is the greatest
thing that has eveer happened to
drum a linn drum machine.

On “No. 10, Upping St.,’’ B.A.D’s
second platter, Jones brings in old
Clash buddy Joe Strummer to write
and produce. The result is a B.A.D.
record twice as bad as the only as
good as the melody, where the
melody is only as good as the
message

Strummer and Jones team up on
two of the record’s most melodic,
evocative tracks, ‘Beyond the Pale”’
and “V. Thirteen.”’ Both tracks are

sco memante

driven by a_ light, understated
rhythm track, and both possess a
poignant lyrical detail that has been
missing from most of Jones’ recent
work. ‘‘Beyond the Pale’’ is one of the
best things to come out of the
Strummer-Jones camp in many a
new moon. The song’s narrator is a
young punk from ‘‘the dark side of
London/& that’s way beyond the
pale.’’ He recounts how bad his living
conditions are, determined to get his
message through before the cold
winter sets in. He cries indignantly:
“Don’t anybody know that/This city
was made Of immigrant blood and
money?”’ It is a touching moment on
an altogether powerful record.

“V. Thirteen’’ is is an apocalyptic
rap anthem accentuated by B.A.D.
soundman Don Letts’ recording of a
radio evangalist sermon to ‘‘Sodom
and Gomorrah.” In answer to the
preacher, Jones shouts triumphant-
ly, “Sodom & Gomorrah! Let the
D.J. play!/Cos I’m only gone tom-
morrow and here today...”’

But these aren’t the only two tunes
on ‘“‘No. 10, Upping St.” There’s the
brilliant “‘ C’mon Every Beatbox,”
where Jones and Letts trade off lines
over a punishing rhythm track set to
the tune of Eddie Cochran’s ‘“‘Sum-
mertime Blues.’’ ‘“‘Don’t worry ‘bout
the power, we got a generator,”
Jones sings; to which Letts answers,
“Batteries for rent, you can pay us
later.”

Other tracks are more stridently

political. With the possible exception
of Easterhouse, Big Audio Dynamite
is the most intelligent, perceptive
political pop group on earth planet.
On last year’s ‘‘Medicine Show,”
Jones used snakeskin oil as a
metaphor for a modern day cure-all,
singing prophetically, ‘“‘And I read in
the Middle East/How they traded
some for a hostage release.’’ On the
new record, B.A.D. is no less percep-
tive. ‘Ticket,’ sung brilliantly by
Letts, is the new album’s best polical
number. In one broad, ironic stroke,
Letts uses a ticket as a symbol of
unemployment, street crime,
violence at sporting events, and drug
trafficing. You’ve got to hear it to
understand it. The song’s melodic
and rhytmic hook is guaranteed to
bounce around in your head for at
Jeast a week straight.

“Limbo the Law’ and ‘“Sightsee
M.C.” are the most pure examples of
B.A.D.’s mixture of rock and rap to
be found on the new record, while
“Dial A Hitman”’ is the funniest, hip-
pest indictment of America’s Ram-
boerminator mentality that I’ve yet
heard. Here’s a sample lyric from
the “Dial a Hitman:”’ ‘“‘Yeh! Soldiers
of Fortune/But we’re not mental
giants/But mister I must tell you
Neither are our clients.”

“No. 10, Upping St.’’ is the real
thing: rock n’ roll to exalt over, cause
for celebration. It could change the
way you dance, change the way you
think, might even change the way
you bathe.

Big snow
blankets
Lexington

By GEORGE G. SPARACIO
Staff Reporter

 

More than 24 inches of snow fell on
Lexington this past week, immobiliz-
ing some, but changing this small
southwestern Virginia town into a
winter wonderland for others.

The snow was an excuse to have
unexpected fun. Students could be
seen bumper riding down the street
or riding sleds or toboggans.
Snowball fights and wrestling mat-
ches in the snow were not rare sights.
Dogs were also playing in the snow.

The snow inconvenienced many.
Snowed-in cars, icy roads and large
snow banks made driving treach-
erous, and on top of all this, the local
hardward store ran out of snow
shovels. In addition, many girls were
stranded at Washington and Lee for
as many as three days.

Stonewall Jackson Community
Hospital handled the snow quite well.
Many staff members had to stay
over-night so as to accommodate the
patients. The roads leading up to the
hospital were kept clear. There were
no deaths due to the snow.

James Arthur, the superintendent
of buildings and grounds, said that in
the case of such a large amount of
snow, all the members of the
buildings and grounds department
work on clearing the snow, from elec-
tricians to plumbers to janitors.

Arthur went on to say that there
will only be minimal delays on the
Gaines Residence Hall project due to
the snow and and cold weather.

Throughout all of the snow, W&L
did not close down. Frank Parsons,
executive assistant to the president,
said that the last time the university
closed was in 1960. President Fred
Cole, from Alabama, closed the
university after only a few inches of
snow fell. The accumulation was so
minimal that many of the students
went to the newly opened Homestead
ski area for a fun filled day.

Parsons went on to say that most of
the students live within walking
distance to the university. Those peo-
ple who live out in the country should
be somewhat prepared. The universi-
ty’s position is that if a faculty
member or a student cannot make a
class because of snow, he can deal
with that on an individual basis. Due
to the W&L trimester, if classes were
cancelled, they would definitely be
made up ona Saturday.

Traditionally, W&L does not close
due to inclement weather. Although
the snow was heavy most of the
students attended classes during the
snow.

Superdance

gets license

By TOM BRICKEL
Staff Reporter

Seniors Tom Thagard and Jim
Barker, chairmen for the Feb. 7-8
Muscular Dystrophy Association
Superdance, had been promoting the
dance as an alcohol-free event up to
this point, hoping people would join
them on the basis of the dance being
an extremely enjoyable and worthy
cause.

However, with the approval of the
Alcohol Beverage Control (ABC), the
Superdance will be able to sell beer
this year, attracting those that may
not have come to the dance for
aesthetic enjoyment.

According to Barker, the beer
license is an “‘added attraction” to
the already busy event, now in its
ninth year at Washington and Lee.
The license is contingent on the crea-
tion of a beer garden similar to the
ones used at recent SAB concerts. In
accordance with the change in the
legal drinking age, beer will be sold
only to students age 21 and older who
show positive identification.

“We plan to rope off an area on the
right side of the pavillion,” said
Barker, describing the set-up of the
beer garden. ‘‘There will be two en-
trances into the area: one for
dancers who can legally drink, and
one for non-dancing participants.”

‘Of course, students who will drink
must present their students iden-
tification and drivers license.’’

Though chairmen Barker and
Thagard are counting on the dance
drawing people purely for enjoy-
ment, the license is another attrac-
tion to a fun-filled and very active

Approximately sixty
undergraduate women trudged

through snow and ice Saturday morn-
ing to attend “Sororities and Alter-
natives.”’ The symposium was held in
the Moot Courtroom of Lewis Hall.

Along with representatives from
the administration and the Inter-
fraternity Council, the women dis-
cussed the pros and cons of national
sororities, local sororities, and eating
clubs.

Speaking on behalf of national
sororities was Lissa Bradford, a
member of the National Panhellenic
Conference and advisor for all

Sampson on probation

A Washington and Lee freshman
has been placed on social probation
for the rest of the term and conduct
probation for the rest of the year for
shooting a 15-year-old girl in the
shoulder with a blowdart two weeks
ago.

Phillip L. Sampson Jr., of Houston,
also will have to perform an
unspecified amount of community
service for the act.

“T’m just thankful that it didn’t end
up worse than it did,”’ said Sampson,
citing the seiousness of the case.

He could have been expelled.

The girl, a local high school stu-
dent, is the daughter of W&L
Associate Dean of Students Leroy C.
‘“‘Buddy”’ Atkins. She was not injured
seriously.

The Student Conduct Committee, a
13-student disciplinary body, held a
hearing on Sampson’s case Tuesday
night. Because ‘“‘inflicting death or
bodily inury’” is a major offense
under SCC rules, the only was Samp-
son could have been found guilty and
not been expelled or suspended was if
the case involved ‘‘unusual extenua-
tion.”

Michael R. McAllister, chairman
of the SCC, said he could not com-
ment on what the extenuating cir-
cumstances were.

Sampson said Wednesday that he
thought the punishment was fair and
that he would not appeal.

Social probation prohibits him
from attending any fraternity or
university-sponsored social func-
tions. Conduct probation is a warning
that if he appears before the SCC
again, then his case will be viewed
more harshly.

All SCC decisions are reviewed by
the Student Affairs Committee,
which is made up of teachers,
students and administrators. The
SAC was to have reviewed the SCC
decision this afternoon, according to
Dean of Students Lewis G. John,
chairmanoftheSAC.  ,

John said the SAC either could ac-
cept the SCC decision or send it back
to the SCC for further consideration.

Sampson told the Phi last week
that he did not shoot Atkins’ daughter
on purpose, that he had not meant to
hit anyone with the dart and that he
didn’t find out that the girl had been
hit until the next day.

He wrote her an apology.

University Proctor Charles F.
“Murph” Murray said the dart was
at least four inches long. It hit the girl
in the back of the shoulder, Atkins
said, penetrating about a half-inch in-
to her skin.

The dart might have gone in deeper

nationally-affiliated sororities in
Virginia.

Bradford had planned to simply
moderate the symposium, but repre-
sentatives from Dickinson College
were unable to attend due to incle-
ment weather, and she briefly talked
about the umbrella structure of na-
tional sororities.

Explaining the framework of local
sororities at the University of the
South were Dean Cushman and
E’lane Carr. They emphasized the
fact that their status as local
sororities afforded them much
greater autonomy and enabled them
to have much lower-key rush.

Allison Bartell, an administrator at
the University of Richmond, spoke
about the situation on her campus
where national sororities are col-
onizing. She explained that one of the

 

primary reasons for choosing na-
tional sororities was the network of
resource people available to assist
them in their efforts.

National sororities differ greatly
from national fraternities in that
they are more structured, have more
guidelines, and are more involved in
the direct administration of in-
dividual chapters, she said.

Leroy C. “Buddy” Atkins, asso-
ciate dean of students, explained the
eating clubs at Davidson College.
Students from Davidson backed out
at the last minute. He said that some
of the clubs are single-sex, and others
are co-ed. Methods of joining the
clubs vary from being chosen to
simply signing up.

Reaction to the symposium was
mixed. ‘I think it went really well

pie-throws will be one of many ex-
citing events lined up for the 18-hour
dance.

“Several administrators and facul-
ty members have already volun-
teered their time and faces to the
MDA cause,”’ Knapp said. Dean
Leroy C. “Buddy” Atkins and Coach
Daly are scheduled to be victims,
among others.

“The way the pie-throw works,”’
Knapp continued, ‘‘is that all those
present at the dance, dancers and
non-dancing participants alike, bid
on the pies that are to be thrown. The
pleasure, in effect, goes to the
highest bidder.”

In addition to the numerous special
events, several popular bands are
scheduled to play at various times
during the dance. Spiedel, Goodrich,
and Lille, a band originally formed at
the University of Virginia, will per
form 1-4 p.m. Saturday afternoon.
Covacus will perform at 7 p.m. that
evening, followed by the White
Aminals at approximately 10 p.m.

Tickets for attending all three per-
formances will cost $8.50, and can be
bought at the door.

During the interludes between
bands, taped music from WLUR dise
jockeys will be played on the air and
at the dance.

‘We're very excited at the overall
interest in this year’s dance,’ said
Barker. “Numerous student organi-
zations, from Kathekon to the frater-
nities, have already pledged their

OPINION

 

Sunday blues

One of the primary foundations of our country is the
separation of church and state. The first amendment ex-
pressly states that ‘‘Congress shall make no law respecting
the establishment of religion, or the free exercise thereof.’’

Recently, several stores have had to close their doors on
Sundays because of the enforcement of the so called ‘Blue
Laws”’. According to an article in The Rockbridge Weekly on
Jan. 12, David Mertz, manager of Maxway, has estimated
that in Rockbridge County, $900,000 worth of sales will be lost
and employees will lose $78,000 in wages as a result of the

Sunday closings.

The laws that dictate that stores that carry only “‘nonessen-
tial items” should close on Sunday seem to be breech of the
separation of church and state. If a particular shop owner
chooses not to open his store on Sundays because of his own
religious beliefs, that’s fine. The constitution was designed to

give him that perogative.

However, a law that is designed to force all citizens to
“rest” on a particular religion’s sabbath is not only
presumptuous, but goes against the very beliefs that helped
form America. It seems reasonable that any religion could
ask that stores close on their sabbath as well, and con-
ceivably the work week could be cut in half.

To area business in particular, the blue laws spell bad
news. Because of certain exemptions to the laws, stores such
as Kroger and SuperX may stay open, and therefore may get
increased business on Sundays, while other stores that carry
mostly items that can’t be sold on Sunday must close. As
Maxway manager Mertz predicted, the area is bound to lose
money because of the enforcement of the laws. Mertz said the
ability of the local store keepers to serve the needs of
tourists, students, and those who use the horse center will be

inhibited.

We respect the rights of those who choose to revere Sunday
as the sabbath and a day of rest. However, they should
respect the rights of their neighbors, and should not support a
law forcing a belief upon a mass community.

A small town’s
fond memories

 

MY VIEW
By Susan Lewis

 

This is the time of year that many
W&L students begin to complain
about the monotony and boredom of
Lexington. One has to admit that this
stretch between Christmas and
Washington Holidays seems rather
long. It is of course much shorter
than the long haul between the start
of classes and Thanksgiving, but
mentally is does at times seem to last
much longer.

It is almost assuredly all in the
mind, but it is true that there are no
major social ocassions in January
and February. On the other hand as
soon as classes resume after vaca-
tion in February, everyone’s mind
immediately turns to Fancy Dress.
After that (although of course with
much less anticipation) students
have to buckle down in preparation
for finals. It only adds greatly to the
boredom that it is cold and there can
be none of the fall or spring trips to
Goshen or Panther Falls.

So, it is in this six-week time period
that many people, in the midst of the
mid-winter blahs, begin planning
long, elaborate road-trips to places
where “surely there must be more
going on than in Lexington!” Cars
suddenly become a hot commodity
and long-lost high school friends are
suddenly remembered--in such
places as Georgetown-in the hopes of
finding a free place to crash for the
night.

These road-trips do indeed serve as
a great relief from boredom and the
resulting tension and frayed nerves,
but I thought-although it may be
presumptuous — that perhaps by

relating a little bit of what life is like
in the town I’m from, people would
know that there are indeed towns
smaller and with less to do in them
than Lexington. Yes, I know that
many people have just now exclaim-
ed, ‘‘What, she’s got to be kidding!”’,
but I’m not. I never can help but
smile to myself when people moan
and groan about how horribly small
Lexington is. Here are the slightly
stunning statistics — the town of
Wachapreague, Virginia has slightly
over 400 year-round residents. There
are no movie theatres in town. The
two within a reasonable driving
distance are about twenty minutes
away, and are open only on
weekends, with only one showing
nightly, Friday, Saturday, and Sun-
day. The only bowling alley ‘‘near
by” is an hour’s drive. The closest
cities are each over an hour away,
with the added, inconvenience shall
we say, of paying a nine dollar toll
each way to cross the Chesapeake
Bay to goto Virginia Beach.

Needless to say, there is not much
todo there. I’ve lived there all my life
and of course I’ve moped around the
house many times, complaining to
my parents that there was nothing to
do, But when it comes right down to
it, I would not have exchanged my
hometown for any other place in the
world. And I really believe that that
is the way most W&L students feel
about Lexington. Sure, it gets boring.
There are times when we simply
have to get out of here, and when our
four years are over, most of us will
leave, But in looking back on our col-
lege years, we’ll treasure Lexington
dearly, and the memories of the bor-
ing times will fade. We only need to
realize now that there are places
smaller than Lexington and that
someday we’ll remember only the
good times — and we wouldn’t trade
it for any other college in the world.

Student advocates ‘shifted week’ for Easter

To The Editors:

I agree strongly, Mr. Pensec, with your
editorial about the vexing conflict between
Easter and the beginning of Spring Term. I ex-
tend particular praise to your mention of
“bureaucratic red tape.” Very amusing.

More importantly, I agree with your position
emphatically! Just how vexing is this problem of
the calendar when, as you observed, there is a
recent precedent for sidestepping such a con-
flict? I’m perfectly willing to go to classes on
Tuesday through Saturday. We did it in 1984, and
it was NO BIG DEAL. I’m sure others would be
willing to comply with such a shift.

Apparently, however, the faculty and ad-
ministration would prefer to éondone students’
absences on Monday, April 20. This is implied by
the alternatives mentioned in the front page arti-
cle about the calendar. Personally, if I lived far
away (which I don’t), I’d rather go to class dur-
ing a shifted week than miss class because the
schedule couldn’t be changed. Yet because some
hardheaded administrators feel our calendar is
etched in concrete, I am permitted to waste
some of the extensive tuition fee that my parents
pay to the business office. Thanks a lot.

I ask in closing: how tough is it really to shift
the calendar? If it stays as is, I suppose we’ll
deal with it. But I hope I don’t hear any pro-
fessors griping about their students’ failures to
catch up because of inconvenient travel plans,

Readers voice opinions

To The Editors:

Last fall we wrote a letter to The Ring-tum Phi
that aroused interest in the administration and
faculty. To recapitulate the contents of our let-
ter, we are providing a brief summary. We ques-
tioned the new push by the administration for
professors to publish, the increasing size of the
student body, the apparent hostility of the ad-
ministration toward the fraternities, and the at-
tempt to imitate small northeastern schools by
the administration. As a result of our letter, we
were called in by the administration to discuss
our grievances.

This is a synopsis of the discussion. The ad-
ministration contended that the increase in the
size of the university is owed to two factors. The
first is to ensure that fraternities are protected
from declining numbers of men from which to
choose. The second is to guarantee that athletic
teams can be fielded. To respond to this increas-
ed enrollment, more professors will be hired,
maintaining the 11 to 1 student-teacher ration.
Publishing was explained as a means for pro-
fessors to be judged by their peers in their
academic field. And following small north-
eastern colleges where the student body lives,
studies, and socializes as a unit, the administra-
tion also seeks to bring W&L students back to
campus, and to centralize most aspects of
university life.

In response to the assertions of the administra-
tion, we would like to make these points. In
regard to fielding athletic teams, an increase of
300 in the student body has little impact in regard
to quality. For example, Sewanee (University of
the South) has less than 1,200 students, yet their
football teams, which are drawn from a small
student body, manage to beat ours. Centre Col-
lege also successfully fields athletic teams with
less than 800 students. In response to the hiring of
professors to maintain the ratio, we would like to
point out that students will be less familiar with
individual professors, and the increase in the
number of students will reduce the familiar at-
mosphere of the campus. Maintaining the ratio
addresses only part of problem associated with
an increased enrollment.

Concerning publishing, it should be recognized
as only one means of measuring the ability of a
professor — especially at a school which pro-
fesses to be a teaching college. There are pro-

fessors here who stay abreast of their field
through research, which, unlike publishing,
benefits students directly. The ability to teach
should be the main criterion for judging a pro-
fessor at W&L. For example, all candidates for a
position in the history department will lecture to
a class to see how well they teach, a move we
like. Teacher evaluations administered by
students would be another effective way of infor-
ming the W&L community of faculty strengths
and weaknesses.

Bringing students back to campus by building
residence halls is an act by the administration
that will weaken the fraternities. This policy is
inconsistent with the announced pro-fraternity
intent behind increasing the size of the student
body, This administrative direction threatens
the autonomy of fraternities, by placing their
social functions under tho watchful eye of the
hill. While regulations are necessary, total
regulation is not. If the honor code is to be more
than a slick marketing technique, students must
be free to choose, for better or for worse.
Students living off-campus are forced to make
their own decisions and accept the conse-
quences, while those living in university housing
are denied this opportunity. The sacrifice of a
perfectly-behaved student body is worth the
freedom for growth and maturity.

Our purpose in writing this letter is to bring
these issues out into the open, maintaining the
lines of communication between students, facul-
ty, and administration. All opinions should have
a share of the floor in order for the most produc-
tive change to result. Decisions should be made
by all parts of the university, not just the ad-

ministration.

Lost late nights at Lloyds?

To The Editor:

The recent sign that has been posted in Lloyds
of Lexington that says ‘For Sale’ has come as a
great shock to me.

Lloyds has always been a place to go for late
night food after studying and partying. The video
games provide relief to students during exam
time and weeknight evenings.

To me Lloyds has become an institution in the
Washington and Lee community. When alumni
come back they even speak of the familiar say-
ing ‘‘Let’s go to Lloyds”’ for some late night food.

I think it would be a shame for Lloyds to be
sold and turned into a restaurant that would
serve beer and close at 11 p.m. Lexington needs a
place that provides food (like Lloyds) that is
open for 24 hours.

As I understand it the reason Lloyds is to be
sold is because the actions of students (including
myself) who catch a buzz and go to Lloyds and
throw food and make a mess. The employees at
Lloyds are sick and tired of having to put up with
this behavior. We of the W&L community should
be considerate of their feelings and straighten
our act before we lose this late night eating
establishment.

Senior dislikes gym’s ‘slime’

To The Editors:

I am writing this letter to complain about the
terrible conditions in the locker rooms and
bathrooms in the University gymnasium.

These places are real pits. There is some
serious slime growing on the floor of the men’s

showers, half of which don’t work to begin with
(why doesn’t someone fix the over one dozen
showers that don’t work?).

The sauna area is another place that has not
seen a mop for the better part of the last decade.

The conditions of these facilities reflect poorly
on the University, especially to anybody who is
visiting.

I don’t think it is asking too much for someone
to go in and clean these places up. The filth in the
locker rooms pose a serious health hazard and I
think it is the responsibility of the University to
do something about the situation.

I think I have also discovered a solution to the
basketball court shortage that Mike Shady men-
tioned in his column last week.

You will remember that Mr. Shady (and he is
rit thé ofly 6ne fo notice this problem) told us
that because the women’s volleyball team was
using Doremus gym for practice that there is no
longer anyplace for students to play pick-up
games.

Well, why don’t we let the women’s volleyball
team practice out at that great investment we
call the pavilion? All you have to do is tape down
some lines and put up a net and Bingo! — an in-
stant volleyball court.

This way the women can practice, the long
tradition of pick-up games will continue and we
will get some use out of that big tin shed where
we sometimes hold concerts. This way every-
body gets a chance to make the most of the the
athletic facilities.

Samuel J. Foley IV ’87

Who asked whom?

To The Editor:

In your January 22 issue, the front page
featured a news story by George G. Sparacio
with the headline ‘Easter clashes with class.”’
Referring to the fact that classes for the 1987
spring term start on Easter Monday, Mr.
Sparacio asserted that ‘‘the feeling of students in
general is one of indifference.”

Upon reading this sentence, two questions oc-
curred to me. First, whom did Mr. Sparacio
survey in making this assessment? Personally, I
am adamantly opposed to the start of classes on
Easter Monday, because it will force me to miss
Sunday worship and Easter dinner with my
family. Also, he must not have asked his own
editor, who objected to the current calendar on
page two of the same issue. Furthermore, I con-
ducted a random, unscientific poll and found that
all of those students with whom I spoke would
prefer to have Easter Monday off. Based on all of
this, I seriously doubt the accuracy of Mr.
Sparacio’s assertion.

My second question deals with the more
general subject of journalistic ethics. Again, I
wondered, whom did Mr. Sparacio question
before asserting that ‘‘the feeling of students in
general is one of indifference?” I know that he
did not ask the entire student body, because Mr.
Sparacio never asked for my opinion. Further-
more, try as I might, I could not find a single stu-
dent whom Mr. Sparacio had asked.

This, then, is my second question: What basis
does Mr. Sparacio have for making this broad,
sweeping generalization? How many students
did he survey? What exactly did he ask them?
Were his subjects representative of the student
body as a whole? Were any of them practicing
Christians? How many? Clearly, a survey in
which many or all of the participants were Jewis
would not accurately represented the opinions of
W&L “students in general.’’ What were the
specific numerical results of his poll? In fact, did
he ask any one at all, or did he simply turn an ap-
parent news article into an editorial?

I hope that Mr. Sparacio can refute my objec-
tions with solid, numerical evidence. If not, he
owes the readers of this newspaper an apology, I
await his response.

Yes, it’s definitely ice cream season.

So in the spirit of the season, I’ve been surveying people by phone to
determine their favorite flavors of ice cream. The survey is by no
means scientific, especially since I didn’t make any calls. I just left a
message on the old answering machine asking for the caller’s name,
phone number, message and favorite flavor of ice cream.

Of course, I didn’t say I was polling people. I didn’t even know I was
taking a survey until this past weekend when I realized I hadn’t chosen

Although the votes still are pouring in, the preliminary results may
be startling, even exciting. For those of you scared that Lexington is
too conservative and traditional, I’m pleased to inform you that there
was only one W&L vote for plain old vanilla, and that came from a cer-
tain Ring-tum Phi editor, who shall remain nameless.

Chocolate and chocolate almond fudge both got votes. So did

The people at Sweet Things should be happy. There was one vote
each for amaretto almond, creme de menthe, Heath and Oreo. My
girlfriend likes vanilla fudge, I discovered, and someone else likes

One caller voted for chocolate chocolate chip. Does that make you a

Now although all I had to do was record the answers, conducting this
survey was no easy task. Some (boring) people didn’t respond. One
friend aplogized because he feared that his flavor of choice—which
would be in poor taste to print, and worse in ice cream—would make
me think he was calling me names.

One person told me I had a nice message. Another said that my
machine hurt, my message hurt and I hurt. I had to drink a whole fifth
of milk just to numb my senses after that one.

But the real coup de grace (or coupe de glace, if you will) was the
death threat I received a few Sundays ago. It always makes my day to
hear such a friendly voice tell me that hell is going to rain down on me,
and that not only will I be dead, but I’ll be f-ing dead.

I must admit, despite his poor taste in phone messages — worth one
year in prison and/or a $1,000 fine — he did have good taste in ice
cream. He was one of four people who voted for mint chololate chip,

MY VIEW

By Clement Edward
Klank III

 

 

Baltasar Gracian once said, ‘“‘The
greatest wisdom often consists in ig-
norance, or the pretense of it.’’ Just
the other day, I came across a pro-
blem on campus, one which presents
a case of blatant discrimination. I
would like to present this problem to
you (the reader) by an adaption of
my experience. All names have been
changed and/or withheld in order to
protect the innocent.

On a weekday afternoon, I was
spending some time in The Book-
store/Food Cooperative. After trying
a free sample of tasty frozen yogurt,
I sat down and ate some french fries.
I did not put any of the co-op’s ket-
chup on them — it looks like watered-
down tomato paste. After I finished
eating, I decided to go into the
bookstore and see if they had any
new plaid, “party animal’’ boxer
undershorts. It appeared to me that
they still have the same inventory as
they did at the beginning of the year.
I cannot imagine them not selling
alot of them. I then decided to see
what new stuffed animals they had. A
new “Garfield” caught my eye. At
that moment, a male coed, wearing a
silk/satin sweatsuit, made his en-
trance. On the back of his shirt,
“Flash” was spelled out. On his right
sleeve he had a David Lee Roth pat-
ch. For purposes which will become
evident later, I referred to him as
“Rash.” As he approached the sales
clerk, I noticed he was in much pain.
Exasperated, he finally made it to
the sales desk. I knew he was suffer-
ing greatly. ‘‘Rash’’ explained to the
clerk that he had been jogging. Dur-
ing his run, he had rubbed himself
raw, and he desperately needed some
type of antifungal ointment. The
clerk turned and looked at the shelf of
toiletries. She couldn’t find any groin
ointment. She told ‘Rash’ that they
had toothache medicine, Midol, and
an extensive selection of feminine
protection, but surprisingly no groin
medicine. Finally, after accepting
the fact that the bookstore had no
ointment for his potentially serious
problem, ‘‘Rash”’ painfully exited,
his future uncertain.

The potential implications of this
problem should be obvious. Although
the bookstore carries a rather com-
plete line of toiletries for the females’
personal needs, it does not begin to
meet all of the male’s medical needs-
case in point, jock rash. Don’t get me
wrong, I have been in favor of
feminine protection from the very
beginning, but, I also feel it is very
important that the bookstore keeps a
supply of antifungal ointment. Just
imagine, if all the male students at
Washington and Lee were joggers, it
would be possible that their groins
could rot away, just because the
bookstore does not carry any rash
ointment. I am upset and shocked. I
hope something can be done before
the problem becomes irreverisible.
Equality for all! The bookstore must
realize its mistake. Groin ointment
must arrive on campus. For now,
however, we can only sympathize
with “Rash” and other victims. In
conclusion, a Japanese proverb:
“Don’t take a gilded sword to cut a
radish.”

Bringing
MY VIEW
By Mark Farley

 

 

The construction of the Gaines
Residence Hall suggests that
students are being encouraged to
leave their Lexington apartments
and country houses and return to the
fold of the W&L community. Many
would like to see an increase in the
number of students living on campus
in a dorm or in the Wood’s Creek
Apartments. This is not a good idea.

Don’t get me wrong; the building of
a new dorm in itself is not a bad
thing. As almost all would agree, the
residence hall is sorely needed. But,
as the administrators of the Universi-
ty plan for the school’s future, they
should resist the temptation of trying
to make Washington and Lee a self-
contained entity surrounded by the
Lexington community.

There are definite advantages to
attending a university that, because
some students life off campus, isn’t a
prisoner to its own boundaries. W&L
and its students are insulated enough
from the outside world as it is.

    

 

Already people view college as a
monastic life in an ivory tower (well,
not exactly monastic, but you get the
idea...). The development of a stu-
dent body residing directly on the
campus would only intensify this
perception. Students need to be away
from the idyllic environment of the
University, even if it is just so they
can experience mean landlords,
greedy utilities and the frustration of
daily commuting.

College is a time when students are
weaned from the protection and
guidance of an entity ‘‘in loco paren-
tis.”’ Living away from the Universi-
ty forces us to acknowledge that the
campus and Washington and Lee will
not always be the center of our lives.

More importantly, living off cam-
pus gives the students some sense of
their role in, and their respon-
sibilities towards, the city and people
of Lexington. Living in dorms only
heightens our feeling of isolation
from the community. Renting a
house or an apartment requires us to
learn to be good neighbors and
tenants, not just guests.

Granted, living off campus does
distance the students from the

Roe v. Wade prompts

RRR TEATAER N ilEATI
By MARGARET PIMBLETT and

MARIE DUNNE
Staff Reporters

The Rockbridge Valley Chapter of
the National Organization for Women
held a demonstration Friday in the
Courthouse Square to commemorate
the 14th anniversary of the Supreme
Court decision in Roe v. Wade which
legalized abortion in the first
trimester of pregnancy.

About 15 people carried signs in
favor of legal abortion on demand
and walked through nearly a foot of
snow in the square.

Chapter Coordinator Pamela
Simpson said, ‘‘We felt the need to do
this locally because there has been
recently a right-to-life group that has
formed. We felt it was really
necessary for us to take a public
stand right now to say that there are
lots of people, in fact we feel a ma-
jority of people, who support the
Supreme Court decision.

Simpson listed several points
which she said indicated that the na-
tional consensus supports a woman’s
choice. Among these were results of
a Peter Hart & Associates pool show-
ing 74 percent of Americans suppor-
ting the Roe v. Wade decision. She

“They’d provide an opportunity
for all the girls to get together and
havea place where they can meet,
and for them to have a social op-
tion other than fraternities.”’

Benny Savage, sophomore, Pied-
mont, Calif.

“Tt’s too new for us to have it. I
went to the sorority symposium...
we'd only be able to have three
sororities because of our small
number. If you had one building
and all the sororities were
together it wouldn't be too cliquey
and that way I'd be for it.”

also said that 21 of 22 attempts to
pass state level anti-abortion
measures have failed, and that the
one which passed was a Colorado rul-
ing limiting ‘‘state funding for health
care for women.”’
The irony of al] of these right-wing ef-
forts is that what they do is take the
right away from the women who
can’t afford to have them (abor-
tions),’’ Simpson said. ‘‘It’s just the
way the Reagan administration is
trying to take away the right of
women to control their bodies, while
they’re also at the same time taking
away funding for nutrition. They’re
forcing poor women to have children
and then taking the right away from
them to support them and let these
children grow up and be healthy.”’
Hazel Bernard, co-coordinator of
the NOW chapter, said that the rally
had originally been scheduled for
Thursday afternoon, the actual an-
niversary of the Supreme Court deci-
sion, but was postponed because of
the snow. “A major reason for our
being here was so that the people in
the community could see visible
evidence that there is support for the
decision, and we obviously thought
that there wouldn’t be that many peo-
ple out on the streets yesterda

“I really don’t see it as affecting

diverse extracurricular oppor-
tunities and activities that are of-
fered on campus. It seems unlikely,
however, that a student who is un-
willing to walk or drive for five
minutes to see a Contact lecture,
would even bother to leave his dorm
room and go across campus to see
the speaker. Anyway, most students
who live off campus stay in the even-
ing to study at the Library.

In addition, the creation of more
university-sponsored housing would
place an added stress on the fraterni-
ty system. All of the fraternities must
fill their rooms in order to be cost ef-
fective; and one of their principle at-
tractions has always been their prox-
imity to the Hill. A glunt of campus
housing would make it more difficult
for the fraternities to fill their rooms
without requiring their members to
live there.

Some students will want to live on
campus. They should not be denied
that right. If more campus housing is
needed, it should be built. Yet, on the
whole, the students and the school
will be better off if they are directed
out into the community and not back
on themselves.

local vigils

(Thursday),”’ Bernard said.

Constance R. Harvey, 82, a resi-
dent of Rockbridge County, said,
“When I was young and at risk I
would never have had an abortion.
But I have lived long enough to feel
deeply that it is very immoral to
bring a child into the world who has
no real prospect of a decent life and a
future. I think this is something that
people nowadays have to consider
very seriously.”

“Tt is a dreadful thing to have to
have an abortion, but it is very wrong
to have anyone impede a woman's in-
dividual choice,” Harvey said.

“Recently a local anti-abortion
group has organized in Lexington.
We felt the need to take this public
stand to assure that both sides of the
issue are heard,”’ read a statement
handed out at the NOW demonstra-
tion.

The anti-abortion group the state-
ment refers to is the Rockbridge
Christian Action Council, which held
a prayer vigil for the unborn at the
Grace Presbyterian Church in Lex-
ington Thursday evening. The vigil
had originally been planned to be
held at the Lexington Courthouse

Otey inspires lectures

 

Staff Reports

 

“The women’s movement has as
its goal political and economic
equality for men and women. Equal
rights will bring equal duties and
women may neither shirk nor dodge
their responsibilities. In the
economic field equal pay for equal
work must be the slogan. When
women seek competitive positions
they must be equally as efficient as
men applying for the positions, nor
dare they, because of sex, underbid
men competitors and so lower the
standards of living for both sexes.”’

The author of those words, written
in 1929, is Elizabeth Lewis Otey who
set forth her personal views in a
Lynchburg newspaper in a story en-
titled “What Women Must Do To
Reach The Goals Feminism Has
Set.” The writing stands as a
testimonial to Otey’s political ac-
tivism in the women’s movement in
the first half of this century and to the
timelessness of the issues in that
movement.

Washington and Lee University
will inaugurate a lecture series in
Otey’s honor at 4:30 p.m., Monday,

February 9, when Colorado Con-
gresswoman Pat Schroeder will
deliver the first Elizabeth Lewis Otey
Lecture. The lecture, in Northen
Auditorium in the University
Library, is free and open to the
public.

Otey, who died in 1974 at the age of
93, was among the first suffragettes
who marched on the White House in
support of the women’s rights move-
ment. A graduate of Bryn Mawr Col-
lege in 1901, Otey studied at the
University of Chicago and took her
Ph.D. at the University of Berlin in
1907.

Upon returning to this country, she
became a special agent of the Bureau
of Labor where she was engaged in
the federal investigation into the con-
ditions of employment of women and
children, and wrote the sixth volume
of the report titled ‘The Beginning of
Child Labor Legislation in Certain
States.”

In an interview with the ‘‘Roanoke
World-News” shortly before her
death, Mrs. Otey said she was “‘born
believing’ in the women’s rights
movement. She was the daughter of
one prominent Virginia suffragette,

Elizabeth Lewis, and the niece of
another, Orra Gray.

“We had a splendid suffrage move-
ment in Virginia and all of us were
there — Mary Johnston, a novelist,
and Lila Valentine and Ellen
Glasgow, another novelist of great
distinction,’ said Otey in the inter-
view.

Otey was one of the first women in
Virginia to run for public office when,
in 1921, she unsuccessfully ran as the
Republican nominee for superinten-
dent of public instruction. She said in
the interview that she accepted the
nomination ‘scared to death” and hit
the campaign trail where one polit-
ical meeting was hastily called off
when it was announced she was com-
ing.

Otey, the interview said, ‘scowls
at the idea that women need protec-
tion. And she approves of today’s ac-
tivists who are fighting such outdated
notions. Women’s lib? ‘I don’t even
know what they men by ‘lib’. Liberty,
I suppose. But certainly women
ought to exercise their political
obligations and duties — just as men
do.”’

Arby’s re-opens in town

By STACY MORRISON
Staff Reporter

 

Arby’s, on Main Street in Lex-
ington, has reopened after closing
this summer due to financial
troubles. The fast-food chain
restaurant opened again on Monday,
November 20 for a one-day trial-run
and has remained open since.

Jon Markley, a co-owner of the
restaurant, said that he decided to
close Arby’s because of “financial
gymnastics and confusion.”’ In Oc-
tober of 1985, he and his brother, Don,
bought the Lexington Arby’s and two
others in Lynchburg. Then, the
Manor Hotel, the central business in
the building that houses Arby’s, went

bankrupt in February of last year.
The hotel had a long lease with high
rates, and the financial burdens were
passed onto the other merchants of
the building, including Arby’s and
Lexington Lighting and Electric Sup-
ply.

Eventually, Markley decided to
sell Arby’s back to the First Virginia
Bank in Roanoke, he said. However,
the bank returned at the end of the
summer and offered to renegotiate
the terms of the lease. The bank
“really went out on a limb to help,”
Markley said. The new lease includes
a “retail clause” that allows the
lease terms to fluctuate in accor-
dance with the business that Arby’s
receives. The lease period has been

Hampsters halt Generals’ win streak at three

 

By MIKE SHADY
_Assistant Sports Editor

In college basketball, those who
can handle pressure situations usual-
ly succeed while those who can’t
“break down and crumble. Tuesday
night, the Washington and Lee
basketball team turned into powder
‘as it blew a ten point lead with less
than three minutes left in the second
half and lost ot Hampden-Sydney,
81-78.

Unfortunately, the loss marred
what should have been a glorious mo-
ment for Jefferson Harralson. The
senior forward became only the four-
teenth player in W&L history to
reach the 1,000 point plateau in
career points.

The defeat also stopped W&L’s
winning streak at three, after a 80-78
‘overtime win at Emory University
last Saturday.

The Generals had a 75-65 advan-
‘tage with 2:51 remaining when the
Tigers mounted their comeback.
‘Juniors Gary Schott and Steve Han-
‘cock missed the front end of one-and-
one free throws and two quick

buckets by Griff Morris and a three-
point shot by Mike Wheeler brought
Hampden-Sydney to within three,
75-72.

“Our kids lost concentration,” said
head coach Verne Canfield. ‘They
assumed that they had won. You just
do not do that.”’

Senior Rob Spencer provided some
breathing room as his three point
play with 1:13 left bumped the lead
back up to six. However, with 33
seconds showing Ralph Baker hit a
three-point play of his own and the
Tigers had a 80-77 lead.

The Generals still had a chance
when with 15 seconds left Hancock’s
layup attempt spun out. W&L retain-
ed possession but a turnover and
subsequent foul shot by Baker gave
Hampden-Sydney its final margin of
victory. Sophomore Manny Klump
hit a three-point shot at the buzzer
but the officials ruled he was fouled
before he released the ball. So with
one second left, Klump went to the
line and the Generals’ chances had
slipped away once again.

Lately, W&L’s down falls have
usually been a result of a struggling
offense. This time it was the defense

that faltered as the Generals ripped
the chords to the tune of 59 percent.

“We didn’t play a good defensive
game,”’ said Canfield. ‘‘We let them
penetrate. We also let one young man
hit five three-pointers. That bothers
me.”’

The lone highlight of the contest
was Harralson’s individual perfor-
mance. With exactly 10:52 remaining
in the first half, Harralson nailed a
10-foot jumper for career points 999
and 1000. He finished the evening as
the leading scorer with 25 points, 11
rebounds and seven assists. Har-
ralson now ranks 12th on W&L’s all-
time scoring list.

‘He played an excellent basketball
game,” said Canfield.

Despite the adverse weather condi-
tions this past week, the Generals
were able to travel to Emory, nar-
rowly escaping with an overtime win.

Sophomore Lee Brading was high
scorer for both teams, tossing in 20
points before fouling out of the
ballgame. Support was provided by
Hancock and Harralson who scored
19 and 16 points respectively.

“I was pleased with Lee,” said

‘ Snow and bad weather conditions

what the Aquatics program had

By dropping the yardage swum
every day, W&L head coach Page
Remillard allowed his men to rest
their bodies and become healthy, in
an attempt to upset their long time
rival. Careful roster work and
scouting of Hopkins’ times consumed
a major part of the coaching staff’s
week.

After a phone conversation with
the Johns-Hopkins coach, Remillard
seemed confident that the Generals
would have gained the victory they
were looking for. Hopkins had put
their strongest swimmers in the
events that W&L predicted they
would, and Remillard had concen-
trated on other events. “We would
have fooled them,” he said before a
hastily scheduled Friday afternoon
practice.

The Women’s team was not taper-
ing for the Hopkins meet, but they
were equally excited about the trip.
Since they were not scheduled to
swim on Saturday, they saw their

competition weekend go totally down
the tubes.

Towson State, a Division I pro-
gram, had no idea that the Generals
had rested for the weekend, and from
the first event, the 400-yard Medley
Relay, it was obvious that there was
no threat from the home team.

Although the Generals didn’t leave
smoke on the water, there were some
good swims this weekend.

Sophmore Moose Herring and
freshman Adam Morgan came from
20 yards back to out-touch their 200-
yard Butterfly opponent at the wall.
Morgan said that he had swam
against the Towson butterflyer
before, and he “knew that he would
die.”

Both the Men’s and Women’s
teams finally get a homestand this
weekend, with the two squads swim-
ming Shepherd on Friday night (7
p.m.) and Gettysburg on Saturday
(at noon).

 

Canfield. ‘‘He really took the bali to
the hole. (Freshman) Wes Boyd
came off the bench and did a good job
and the big men up front played well
also.”

Tied at 72 all at the end of regula-
tion, the Generals could have won the
game easily if it wasn’t for their dif-
ficulty at the foul line. W&L shot a
stellar 13 for 28 and Canfield explain-
ed the problem as a case of ‘‘one of
those games that they didn’t drop.”

The Generals’ record now stands at

9-6, 3-4 in the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference. The team will play
Emory and Henry tonight at the
Warner Center. Tip-off time is
scheduled for 7:30.
HOOKSHOTS: The Generals are now
a combined 22 out of 46 from the
charity stripe in their last two
games... Senior guard Fred Bis-
singer didn’t make the Emory trip
because he had to partake in the
MBA exams. .. Canfield still has of-
fensive woes as the team is ‘‘still hav-
ing trouble consistently scoring from
the inside’’.... Junior Lou Trosch is
leading the Generals in field-goal ac-
curacy, hitting an incredible 67 per-
cent of his attempts...

Harralson said the team has
been playing well and hopes the
player’s confidence can build for
the end of the season and tourna-
ment time.

He feels the team needs a big
win to build confidence even
more.

“We play Emory & Henry
Saturday which would be a big
win,” said Harralson.

Emory & Henry was 16th in the
nation last week and Harralson
said he hoped fans would come out
and support the team in its try for
the win.

Harralson is a business major
from Princeton, Kentucky.

He was a_ basketball team
member at Caldwell County High
School where he earned honors on
the all-Kentucky team.

Senior basketball co-captain
player Jefferson Harralson
scored the 1,000th point of his

Hampden-Sydney. For that he has
been named the W&L Athlete of

“It was a feeling of relief,” said
Harralson. ‘I’m just happy to
have reached it.”’

He needed 10 going into Tues-
day’s game and got them early. “I
scored 10 of the teams first 16
points, but didn’t know it until
later.”’

Harralson’s 25 points increased
his career total to 1015 which plac-

Satellites kick some butt

By CHARLIE GAY
Staff Reporter

 

Georgia Satellites self-titled first
album is not progressive, it covers no
new ground, and indeed, sounds
almost suspiciously familiar from
beginning to end. Despite this (or
perhaps because of it) ‘Georgia
Satellites’ lays down some of the
best damn rock ‘n’ roll put to vinyl in
years.

Though some have said that famil-
iarity breeds contempt, Satellites
dispells that cliche’ on its first listen.
From the Skynyrdesque crunch of
“Keep Your Hands To Yourself” to
the early Stones influenced ‘‘Nights
of Mystery,” you'll be wondering
where it was you heard all this
rollicking stuff before. And you'll be
stomping your foot the whole way, it
not giving the nearest broom the old
air guitar workout too.

Georgia Satellites is Dan Baird
handling lead vocals and guitar,
Mauro Magellan on drums, Rick
Price plunking on bass, and Rick
Richards wielding lead axe. Four
pretty rough lookin’ dudes, but
authors of a thoughtful as well as ass-
kicking record.

The Satellites themselves hail not
from a shack in the hills of North
Georgia complete with still and bare
feet (as you may have guessed from
the ‘Keep You Hands to Yourself”’
video) but the sprawling metropolis
of Atlanta. That’s important, be-
cause it gives a hint that they’re not
quite the grinning good ol’ boys they
may come off as initially. And if you
need a second clue, a close listen to a
few of the tunes, specifically the
lyrics, should do the trick.

The mere title of the first side’s
closing, “The Myth of Love’’ should
be some indication that something
beyond the standard jam session is
going on here. Baird daydreams,
“The Myth of Love, like some new
best friend/the bright promise of
tomorrow, and tomorrows without
end” and then reminds himself ‘‘but I
should know by now’”’ that its not ex-
actly all its cracked up to be.

In the end though, he admits “‘it
could save us, one and all.” Both
“Myth of Love’’ and its companion
piece, ‘Nights of Mystery’’ employ
the same, stripped down riffs that
made John Cougar Mellencamp’s
“Scarecrow” album s¢ popular. Only
the Satellites add about three extra

helpings of volume and about five of
energy

There is also a strong element of
rural morality at the core of the
album which surfaces on the first
single, ‘Keep Your Hands To
Yourself,’ and especially what will
presumably be the second, ‘‘Bat-
tleship Chains.”’ In the former, a tale
of a lusty country boy and his coy
lady friend, Baird sing, ‘‘then she
tole me a story, ‘bout free milk and a
cow/and said no hugs and no kisses
until I get a wedding vow.” “Bat-
tleship Chains”’ is an even clearer ex-
ample, both the chorus (“you got me
tied down with battleship chains/
fifty-foot long with a two-ton an-
chor’’) and the lyrics (‘‘I can’t move
my arms to hug nobody/hug nobody
but you.””) These anecdotes and col
loquialisms appear because Georgia
Satellites are Southerners, probably
with rural ties, and unabashedly so.
Such touches add a not only regional,
but personal aspect to the album.
And by not overdoing it, the Satellites
come off as sincere, and not silly gap
toothed rednecks.

But enough about lyrics. The songs
themselves are grinding yet melodic

And while some of it undeniably
sounds familiar, this works to the
bands advantage. ‘‘Can’t Stand The
Pain” could be the Allmans fused
with Thorogood, plus a dash of vin-
tage Rolling Stones. ‘‘Golden Light”
is R.E.M. with a blood transfusion,
and the quickened Southernized
cover of Rod Stewart and Ron Woods
“Every Picture Tells A Story’ is a
perfect response to the heads down
“Nights of Mystery” and an ap-
propriate close to the album. The
Satellites distill the best of various
artists to churn out a new brand of
eighties Southern rock. Listening to
the album, you can’t help but wonder
why somebody didn’t think of each
song already. ‘‘Georgia Satellites’ is
the obvious conclusion to the
Southern Rock question. They simply
threw out the country rock hang ups
and cranked out their own style of
straight-ahead rock ‘n’ roll.

If you couldn’t guess, I love this
album and you should, too. And

remember, you don’t have to be
Southern to

Junior Class Party is ‘paid for’

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Entertainment Editor

 

“It’s your party. You've already
paid for it.”

That is the sentiment of Junior
Class President Mike Henry, concer-
ning next week’s Junior Class Party,
the first such event in several years
here at Washington and Lee

The party will be held next Friday
night, February 6, at Zollman’s
Pavillion. Flipside, a six-piece band
that specializes in classic rock and
roll, will be the featured band. Open
only to Juniors and their dates, ad-
mission and beer will be absolutely
free of charge.

The money for the party came
from class dues collected during fall
matriculation.

“Most of the juniors paid five
dollars at the beginning of the year,”
Henry said. ‘“S’o be fair, we're going
to ask people at the door if they paid
and if they didn’t, we’ll put their
names on a list and collect the five
dollars later. These new dues will go
toward next year’s senior class par-

ty. That way, we can really doit up.”

Because it is a closed party, Henry
and Junior Class Vice Preisent Doug
Elliot were not requried to obtain a
banquet license. However, in order to
provide a communal source of alco-
hol, the Alcoholic Beverage Control
Board stipulates that no money be
taken up to pay for the alcohol.

Henry said he and Elliot had a
$1,500 budget to work from. Flipside
cost them $800, rental for Zollman’s
Pavillion cost $200, and the rest went
toward invitations, beer, et. al. In a
nutshell, the whole show is paid for.

“T didn’t do this last year because |
was new and just getting used to the
job (of class president),’’ Henry said.
‘But people started coming up to me
and saying, ‘What do you do besides
sit on the Student Control Commit-
I wanted to do it this year
because this will be the first time the
whole class has gotten together since
our freshman year.”

Henry added, ‘“‘When the seniors
were getting together last year for
their senior dinners and so forth, a
bunch of them told me that I should
really try to get the class together for

tee ? :

something before it comes time to
graduate.”

Flipside hails from Richmond and
they feature former W&L student
Rob Crosby on guitar. This six-piece
outift also boasts two drummers and
a repetoire that includes cover ver-
sions of classics from the likes of the
Grateful Dead, the Rolling Stones
the Who, the Beatles and the Doors.
They will kick-off the music at 10 and
are set to play well into two o'clock in
the morning.

Henry he plans to have sober
drivers at the party who will provide
rides back to campus for those party;
goers perhaps too tipsy to get behind

he wheel. Non-alcoholic beverages
willalso be provided.

Henry asks that all party-goers
please have their college I.D.’s ready
at the door in order to avoid any con*
fusion.

He feels the experiment will be a
success.

“Pve tried to talk it up with the
fraternity members, the indepen«
dents — everybody — and most of the.
peple seem to be excited about it.
Like I said, this is your party.”

Times-Dispatch and News Leader,
delivered his speech on First Amend-
ment Freedoms in duPont Audi-
torium.

Earlier, Bryan was named the 1987
recipient of the annual First Amend-
ment Award given by the Washington

-and Lee chapter of the Society of Pro-

fessional Journalists, Sigma Delta
Chi. Before Bryan made his speech in
front of the crowd at the auditorium,
he wanted to make sure that this
award was a result of the entire
Times-Dispatch and News Leader,
including the two reporters who were
present at the controversial murder
trials that led to this decision, Tim
Wheeler and Kevin McCarthy.

The award was the result of
Bryan’s leadership role in the Rich-
mond newspapers’ litigation that
resulted in the landmark by the
United States Supreme Court. The
Richmond newspapers case estab-

Nearly 30 percent of employers
of new college graduates now
screen job applicants for drug
use, and another 20 percent plan
to adopt the practice within the
next two years, according to a
new study by the College Place-
ment Council, Inc. (CPC).

Of the 497 national employers
surveyed, 140 (28.2 percent) said
drug screening, usually including
urinalysis, was required of poten-
tial employees. Almost all em-
ployers with screening programs
tested for both marijuana (97.9
percent) and hard drugs (98.6 per-
cent).

“The data found in our survey
corroborate other reports that
drug screening programs are on
the rise. Clearly the study shows
this is a major employment
issue,”’ said Warren E. Kauffman,
Acting Executive Director of
CPC.

percent) said they would not hire

court trial in the absence of over-
riding counter interest was invalid
under the First and Fourteenth
Amendments. The decision, how-
ever, did not stop trial closures.

At the time of these trials, he had
just become publisher of the two
Richmond papers.

After his speech, Bryan agreed to
take questions from the audience.
When asked if he felt that there were
any casés-that the press should be ex
cluded from, he responded ‘I’m sure

that there are times when the courts '

should be closed to the press. ‘‘ But
he said he was not sure what types of
cases those should be.

When asked about the issue of
presidential executive privilege be-
ing a legal right, Bryan responded,
“T won’t even try to answer that.’”’ He
also said that his two major reserva-
tions in pursuing a case were paying
th lawyers, because he felt they (the
papers) thought that the cases might
not get looked at by the courts.

Bryan spoke hightly of the judge

failed a drug test. However, 37.9
percent said they would retest ap-
plicants, and 75 percent said ap-
plicants who failed could reapply
and receive favorable reconsid-
eration later.

Employers ranked safety as the
top reason for establishing drug
screening programs, selecting it
nearly four times more often than
security, which ranked second. In
descending order of importance,
other reasons included quali-
ty/reliability of products; quality
of service; increased productivi-
ty; control of medical costs; and
law, government, or noncompany
regulations.

Of the 140 employers that
reported screening programs, the
highest percentages were in the
following industries: utilities (37.1
percent); chemicals, drugs and
allied products (9.3 percent);
aerospace (8.6 percent); and-
petroleum and allied products (7.9
percent).

remarked.

When asked about the public’s at-
titude toward First Amendment

the public cares too much about the
Bill of Rights. The public wants the
press to give them the news and tney
con't care how hard it is to get. This
is a problem and we (the press)
should try to educate the public.”’

On the Iran-Contra affair, he felt
that the television networks were
overplayiung the issue by making it
the top story every night. He said
that in his paper they put something
in each issue about the affair, but it is
not the headline story unless a new
development occurs.

In his comments about the state of

ampson is
suspended

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Assignments Editor

 

After reconsidering its initial deci-
sion, the Student Conduct Committee
voted Tuesday to suspend Phillip L.
Sampson Jr. for shooting a 15-year-
old girl witha blowdart.

Unless he successfully appeals the
decision to the 10-member Student
Affairs Committee, Sampson will be
suspended through the end of the
school year.

Sampson, a freshman from
Houston, last week had been placed
on social probation for the rest of the
term and conduct probation the rest
of the year by the 13-student SCC. But
the SAC reviewed the case last
Thursday and asked the SCC to
reconsider the penalty.

The girl, a local high school stu-
dent, is the daughter of W&L
Associate Dean of Students Leroy C.
“Buddy” Atkins. She was hit in the
shoulder but was not injured serious-
ly.
Atkins, a member of the SAC, par-
ticipated in Thursday’s discussion
but abstained from voting, according
to Dean of Students Lewis G. John,
chairman of the SAC.

John said that the SAC agreed with
the SCC’s finding that Sampson was
guilty of a major offense under
university rules because he inflicted
bodily injury. The only two penalties
that may be given for such an offense

are suspension and expulsion, unless
the case involves ‘‘unusual extenua-
tion.”’

John said the SAC could not find
any extenuating circumstances. It
did not ask for a specific penalty,
John said, only that the initial penal-
ty be reconsidered.

A varsity football player and pole
vaulter, Sampson on Saturday
vaulted a school-record 14 feet six
inches indoors at Virginia Military
Institute. When asked Wednesday if
he would appeal the SCC’s decision to
the SAC, Sampson politely said he did
not want to talk about the case.

Sampson told the Phi two weeks
ago that he did not shoot Atkin’s
daughter on purpose, that he had not
meant to hit anyone with the dart and
that he didn’t find out that the girl
had been hit until the next day.

He wrote her an apology.

The incident occurred after the
W&L-Roanoke basketball game on
Jan. 15. Sampson said he shot the
dart from a second-floor window of
the Graham-Lees dormitory toward
some Roanoke fans who were mak-
ing degrading comments to incite the
W&L students. He estimated that the
Roanokers were between 50 and 75
yards away.

Sampson said he knew he could not
shoot the dart that far but thought
that it might intimidate them.

University Proctor Charles F.
“Murph” Murray said the dart was at
least four inches long.

A best-selling French novel has
made ‘‘Washington and Lee” a
household word in France, and in-
spired comparision with “The Cat-
cher in the Rye” and “The Great
Catsby.”” “‘L’etudiant etranger,’’ or
“The Foreign Student,” concerns the
experiences of Philippe Labro, who
attended Washington and Lee Uni-
versity on a scholarship in the 1950’s.

Labro, a prominent French jour-
nalist, had written two previous
novels, as well as directing several
films, one of which was shot in the
Lexington area. His latest work con-
cerns a young man coming of age in
the atmosphere of privilege and con-
formity which characterized Wash-
ington and Lee in the 1950’s. Labro’s
prose evokes scenes familiar even to-
day:

After swearing in four new
members, the Washington and Lee
Board of Trustees will consider a
possible tuition increase while ia
Lexington this weekend.

The most important business on
the board’s agenda will be to look at
the preliminaries of the 1987-88
budget and to consider another in-
crease in tuition.

“It is not that they will approve
next year’s budget,”’ said Farris P.
Hotchkiss, who recently was named
secretary of the board. That budget
will not be completed until the
spring, Hotchkiss said, with the final
vote scheduled for May,

The trustees do have to decide next
year’s tuition because this informa-
tion must be available for the high-
school seniors who are considering
W&L, Hotchkiss said.

Hotchkiss said he did not know how
large a tuition increase the board
was considering. W&L President

Although Labro never mentions
Washington and Lee by name in the
book, he does refer to several sur-
rounding women’s colleges, such as
Hollins and Sweetbriar. He also
refers to many of his companions as
well as professors by name. He men-
tions O.W. Riegel, then chairman of
the journalism department, and jour-
nalism Professor Paxton Davis hav-
ing a particular influence on his life
at Washington and Lee.

Professor John Lambeth, who has
translated parts of ‘‘L’etudiant
etranger”’ into English, remarked on
the book’s ‘‘wonderful sense of action
and description.’’ He noted Labro’s
“sense of humor and acute eye for
telling details about a place.’’ In all,
he said, ‘‘L’etudiant etranger’’ is “‘a
very good and well-written book.”

“L’etudiant etranger’’ has won
four literary awards in France, in-
cluding the prestigious ‘“‘Le Prix In-
terallie.’’ Now in its seventh printing,
the book is at the top of French best-
seller lists. At last count, 118,000
hardcover copies had been sold. The

declined to comment further.

In 1985, the board increased tuition
8.9 percent from $6,515 to 7,100. In
1986, it was increased 7 percent to
$7,600.

The board meeting is set to begin
tomorrow evening and to last until 1
p.m. on Saturday. A dinner honoring
former board Secretary James
Whitehead and his wife will be held
Friday night.

The four new board members were
scheduled to be on campus today for
orientation. They are Dr. William
Gottwald, Richard Haynes, Patricia
Leggett and Vaughan Morrissette.
They were named in the fall, replac-
ing Calvert Thomas and the Rev.
Christopher Keller Jr., who both
retired.

When the four are sworn in, the
board will have 27 members. Twenty-
four are expected to attend, Hotch-
kiss said. The maximum number of
board members allowed by W&L is
30.

The board’s next meeting is
scheduled for May 23 and 24.

 

 
 

OPINION
Destructive

Visitors to Washington and Lee are often captivated by the
simple elegance of our Colonnade. Its gracious and noble
facade are indicative of the good that is Washington and Lee;
its apparant sturdiness, a bulwark against the ravages of

 

time.

Not only the Colonnade, but the entire university is a part
of American history. Countless graduates have left Lex-
ington instilled with the ideals of honor, ideals which best
define the purpose of the University and which set
Washington and Lee alumni apart from graduates of other
universities. The University’s significance to the nation’s
history is of such magnitude that in 1972 it was declared a
Registered National Historic Landmark.

Recently someone decided an addition was needed to the
Colonnade, an addition which took the form of a painted ‘‘87.”’
Class pride is admirable, but there are better ways of ex-
pressing it than by anact of vandalism.

Those responsible consider themselves, as evidenced by
their enrollment in the University, to be honorable, but, by
their action, appear to contradict that assumption.

Upon first glance, the painting appears to be a typically
collegiate act. It is, however, something one would expect of
students at State U., not those of Washington and Lee. The
act shows a lack of respect both for the University and those

associated with it.

There was a time when attending Washington and Lee
marked a man as being polite, gracious and respectful -- i
meant having a sense of who you were and how you fit into

society.

Those adjectives cannot be applied to those responsible for
this despicable act, nor to those who tolerate it. If they are
applied to them, then all that Washington and Lee once stood
for is, like the society written about by Margaret Mitchell,

gone with the wind.

Honor means effort

MY VIEW

By Chris Carter

 

Certain events of last week not-
withstanding, the following rumina-
tions are inspired by two recent ar-
ticals: Jennifer Spreng’s My View of
the ‘“‘Ring-tum Phi’’ of two weeks ago
and an artical in the Jan. 22 edition of
the “W&L Law News.” Miss Spreng
asked, ‘Does any truth exist? I doubt
it.” The artical from the “Law
News” reported a survey of Law
Students’ beliefs in the Honor
System. I find both highly disturbing.

Although the poll of law students
indicates that 86% of the students
polled believe ‘‘the Honor Code is
working here in Lewis Hall,” only
44% of the second year class believes
that the Honor Code is “‘an integral
part” of their law school experience.
Less than half of a law class believes
that honorable behavior is conducive
to becoming a lawyer?! I would like
to think that the poll was simply
grossly statistically inaccurate, but I
have a horrible feeling that it’s ac-
tually somewhat close to the mark.
The Honor System askes no more
than that students live honest and
trustworthy lives; frankly, I hope I
never have any of these second year
students as my lawyers if they don’t
find truth and trust to be very impor-
tant.

One of the students who responded
negatively to the poll asked, ‘(How
can one be honorable in a com-
petative environment?” I’m afraid I
don’t understand her question. Sure-
ly a trial is a competitive situation,
yet I hope that any lawyer presenting
a case would act honorably by follow-
ing the ethical standards of the ABA
rather than doing anything — up to
and including breaking the law — in
order to win ‘the competition.” I
realize that Law Schools are suppos-
ed to be competitive, but again, I’m
not sure that I would ever want as my
counsel anyone who is more concered
about winning than about winning ac-
cording to the rules, or more impor-
tantly their doing what is ethically
and morally right. Those who cannot
handle the competition of law school
and act honorably ought to question
their attending it.

The concerns raised by Miss
Spreng’s colum are somewhat differ-
ent from, but just as disturbing as,
those of the Law School poll. Her
comments were principally concern-
ed with the Iran/Contra issue. As
long as she simply questions whether

although I have somewhat more faith

generalizes to question whether truth
exists and to indicate that in fact it
does not, that she questions much of
what she sees and hears, she brings
the Honor System dashing in to the
scene of the crime and makes me ask
her the same question which I put to
the law students — do you really
think you belong at this school?

If Miss Spreng does not believe that
truth exists, how does she propose to
tell it? Shall we assume henceforth
that all her work is plagiarized even
though she has signed the Pledge?
More importantly, shall we just
scrap the Honor System altogether
since we will never be able to know
the “‘truth” about potential violaters

to all the above is ‘‘no!”’ I hope that
Miss Spreng, when she speaks,
speaks the truth to the best of her
ability. This does not mean she need
always be right — only that she try to
be so. We do not expect the Executive
Committee, nor a Student Body
Hearing, to be able to explain to
everyone’s complete satisfaction
how and why, in the most minute
detail, a certain event happened — I
think only God could do that. But we
do hope they can answer part of that
question, and answer it well enough
for a decision to be made, even
though a lot of work may be neces-
sary in order to gain enough of an
understanding to make that decision.

Perhaps what I really resent about
the two articles in question is that
both imply a disgusting laziness. It’s
easy to say that the Honor System
doesn’t work, or has some bugs, or to
play the game if you scrap the rules.
It’s also easy to say that truth doesn’t
exist; this saves the hours and days
and months sometimes necessary to
discern it. But I, for one, would
rather believe that we can determine
the truth and believe what others say
than live in the sort of meaningless
world Miss Spreng describes. I also
believe that the Honor System has
been an integral part of my under-
graduate experience, although to say
it has been meaningful is not to say
that is has always been easy. I hope
that Miss Spreng and the second year
law students in question, who, after
all, form a very small minority of the
University population, will think
about the implications they believe
and will come to the conclusion that
the pursuit of truth, though difficult,
is possible and is important
regardless of one’s career or age, or
anything else.

IFC representative
defends newly
adopted bylaws

 

MY VIEW
By Jeff Kelsey

 

Recently a great deal of criticism
has been leveled at the IFC and at
Associate Dean of Students ‘‘Buddy”’
Atkins over the new IFC by-laws. As
an IFC representative I have heard
the arguments on both sides and it
seems that many people still do not
understand the importance of pass-
ing many of these by-laws.

First, the question of liability for
fraternities makes these by-laws
necessary. In our increasingly liti-
gious age, a drunk driving accident
can result in drawn out law suits
resulting in millions of dollars in
awards to the victims. If such a suit
were filed against a whole fraternity
at W&L that house would die from the
financial burden. The basic problem
lies in the fact that fraternity houses
are not designed to serve alcohol
under the new drinking age laws. No
one checks ID’s at a fraternity party
and I can not really foresee a change
in this policy. Obviously, the loss of
kegs at parties is not going to keep
underage people from drinking. But
from my point of view that is not the
purpose of the new by-laws. The pur-
pose is to put the burden of respon-
sibility on the individual. If an
underage person wants to drink he
has to find someone old enough to buy
alcohol for him or he can employ a
fake ID (although the latter is very

risky given the EC’s statement on
fake I.D.’s). Regardless of what the
individual does, he has to take the in-
itiative and not rely on the fraternity

to provide for him. The liability is ef- ‘

fectively removed from the officers
and members of the fraternity so that

the individual is solely responsible *

for his own state of intoxication.

Dean Atkins has presented many
other ways for the individual houses
to limit their liabilities and many of
the techniques are incorporated in
the by-laws. But to say that Dean
Atkins has railroaded these by-laws
through the IFC is unfair. Yes there
was pressure to revise and ratify the
by-laws, but that pressure came

from other parts of the administra- |

tion. If the truth were known, I ven-
ture to guess that much of the faculty
and administration would favor do-

ing away with fraternities alto- ,

gether, thus avoiding the headaches.
Dean Atkins, on the other hand,
understands the importance of the
fraternity system in all aspects of
school life, and I believe he prodded
us into taking some initiative so the
University would not seek to take
control of the IFC. It is obvious to me
that Dean Atkins has the fraternities’
best interests in mind.

In conclusion, I wish we still had
kegs as much as anyone else; and

buying beer every weekend is becom- |

ing expensive. However, with the
new drinking age fraternities just
can not afford the risk of kegs. The
parties will continue irregardless
and the fraternities will remain the
center of the W&L social life.

To The Editors:

Having once been an advocate of coeducation
at Washington and Lee and having lobbied for its
implementation, I find it no longer bearable to
keep my guilty conscience silent. The fact is that
now I have witnessed coeducation, I no longer
support it.

The issue of coeducation did not die on July 15,
1984, nor is it a non-reversible state. So let us
reexamine, once again, our little experiment,
this time with the aid of hindsight. The main
argument against coeducation was that it would
break 235 years of all-male tradition at W&L.
The Board of Trustees obviously refused to ac-
cept anything simply on the grounds that it is
traditional. Their decision speaks for itself.

The main reason for going coed is that it would
help boost sagging intellectual involvement and
increase enrollment. But what I have witnessed
the past two years is neither. Women in the
classroom have only brought the courting ritual,
once reserved for the weekend, into twenty-four
hour-a-day existence. Men once dedicated to the
art of collaboration and intimate relationships
with their professors, now cringe and blubber
dotingly, mesmerized by the presence of their
mother image three seats over.

The “tradition”, that word which we so often
speak of but rarely define, now absent, has
become apparent. It is that unique opportunity
which a college offers to strive for truth in a
fraternal atmosphere following the footsteps of
the country’s greatest leaders. What I have
witnessed the last two years is the emasculation
of one of the country’s few remaining masculine
reservoirs, now polluted with the poison of
cleavage and Eau de Cologne.

In essence, what has happened at W&L is what
would happen if women were allowed into the ar-
my: the battlefield would become a bedroom, the
weight room a dancing floor, and the newspaper
a gossip column. I am not a chauvinist, nor do I
dislike women, it’s only women at W&L that I ob-
ject to. I am simply offering my dissatisfaction
with a college ruled by overzealous ad-
ministrators who end up turning a perfectly fine
academic institution into a post-high school
country club complete with birthday dinners and
the latest in debutantes.

Perhaps our administrating body should take a
refresher course in Econ 101. A low supply of all-
male liberal arts colleges yields a high demand,
whereas a large supply of coed, aristocratic
finishing schools returns a low demand. Our all-
male tradition is what sets us apart from all the
other small liberal-arts colleges and to renounce
it is a wish to complacently exist with the rest of
the masses.

Is Washington and Lee a democratic com-
munity or one masked with democratic ideals
but actually governed by an elite few? Perhaps
our administrators fancy themselves a mon-
archy, Each man has a vote in this institution,
not just a few hand-picked starched shirts who
can but their way onto the Board of Trustees. If I
am mistaken in believing I represent the student
bodies opinion, then I am glad to be one of the
graduating few who knew W&L as it once was,
than as it is now and will never be again.

To the college administration all I ask is that
they heed the path of the Coca-Cola Company,
who finally realized that the public like the old
formula better and that mistakes are not irrever-
sible. If the women here object, one can only
scoff at their presumption for thinking they

Fight for your rights

To The Editors:

Ed Klank is at it again! Although his latest ar-
ticle smacks of J.J. (jaundiced journalism), we
support his stand on this, a most serious pro-
blem. Although none of us are in danger of rot-
ting away (we don’t jog), we sympathize with
said Mr. ‘‘Rash.”’ It is time the male side of the

day, no rash ointment, tomorrow, no fraterni-
ties. The male members of the student body
must now rise and push to secure their ever-
shrinking share of the student rights pie!

Klank irritates sophomore

To The Editors:

After reading another of Mr. Klank’s truly
poignant articles, I am amazed that a person
with his writing ability and co rehension of the
English language is allowed to have his articles
printed in this newspaper, much less any news-
paper in America, I think his talents should be
used elsewhere, for example I notice that the
Ring-tum Phi does not publish a menu for the up-
coming week in the dining hall or Cockpit. Per-
haps after his Crusade for Cruex is complete he
could devote his efforts to this next venture.

Sincerely,
Joseph C. Kavanaugh ’89

Changes disturb student

To The Editors:

Addressing the article in the Jan. 8th issue of
the Ring-tum Phi entitled “USA Today says
W&L ‘choosy’.’’ I think Mr. Hartog shouldn’t try
to justify coeducation by the high retention rate
of students remaining at W&L after their
freshman year. Washington and Lee has been a
well liked school before coeducation was ever
thought up. Coeducation hasn’t bothered me as
much as the snowball effect of the changes that
have occurred at this University since my

freshman year. From minor changes such as the
changing of the name of the “Cockpit” to the
“GHQ” to the major changes like increasing the
enrollment (which has forced some freshman to
live in closets) and the extreme push to knock
fraternity parties out.

As you can see in the article on the same page
of the Jan. 8th issue of the Phi entitled “W&L
ranks 8th in national survey,’’ shows that
graduates from W&L (before girls have ever
completed 4 years here) have been very suc-
cessful. I don’t feel a school is a great school
because according to surveys and statistics they
are one of the ‘“‘choosiest colleges”’ in the nation.
It is the education and atmosphere that colleges
offer that makes them great institutions. Prior to
coeducation W&L was known as a good school
with successful graduates, but now it seems as if
everyone wants it to be known as an Ivy League
school that has students with high SAT scores
(which don’t reveal anything personal about a
student.)

I hope students, faculty, and alumni read this
letter and submit their opinions because no one is
commenting on how the attitude of W&L is
changing.

Tommy McBride ’88

More on Klank

To The Editors:

I certainly must agree with Mr. Klank that the
supply store is horribly misguided for not carry-
ing antifungal creams. No doubt Mr. Klank has
probably ‘“‘rubbed himself raw’ on more than
one occasion.

What surprises me, however, is the fact that
while Mr. Klank is so concerned about others’
groin afflictions and a possible plague of Tinea
Cruris he neglects his own case of chronic oral
diarrhea. May I suggest a mouthful of Kaopec-
tate or Donnagel once or twice a week?! Or at
least before he writes his next column!

Please extend to Mr. Klank my sincere wishes
for an improvement in his apparently terminal
condition.

’

ford, the challenge of Washington
and Lee’s production of ‘“‘Cabaret”’ is
largely a conceptual one.

Parker, choreographer for the pro-
duction, and Radford, the show’s
costume designer, face the challenge
of vividly portraying the city of
Berlin in the 1930s, a period that saw
the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi
party.

The subject of pre-World War II
Berlin is not new to Parker, an ac-
tress, director, choreographer,
singer, and playwright who is cur-
rently working out of New York. In
fact, one of the two plays she has
» Written is called ‘Berlin 1922.”

Parker became involved with the
* show at the request of director
, Joseph Martinez, who is associate
professor of drama at W&L. Parker
’ and Martinez were classmates for
, three years at the Royal Academy of
Dramatic Arts in London.
¥  “]’ve wanted to work with Joe for a
long time, and when the opportunity
presented itself recently, I couldn’t
* pass it up,” said Parker. ‘Joseph
and I share the same vision of
theatre, a vision which could best be
‘ described as conceptual.”
Her vision of ‘‘Cabaret’’ is no ex-
ception. Parker is choreographing
4 and staging the musical numbers
with what she describes as ‘‘a con-
ceptual approach.”

‘
For seven years Gladys Steele has

’ been giving the homeless of Lex-
, ington a roof over their head, a warm
meal in their stomach, and someone
who would listen and understand
» their troubles.

When Andrew McThenia, a law

professor at Washington and Lee,
» decided he wanted to help the
homeless, his wife introduced him to
Steele. What has become of this rela-
tionship is Lexington’s first official
homless center, Gladys House.
* McThenia had been holding
meetings with local church officials
and any other interested citizens
’ when Steele first decided to attend
the meetings. About a month ago,
after sitting in on the meetings and
realizing the homeless needed a
place, Steele called McThenia and of-
fered her home as shelter for the
homeless,

“It was getting cold and I knew
that they would need a place to stay,”
* said Steele.
» Steele said she knew how the

homeless felt, because at one time
* these people were her ‘‘drinking bud-
+ dies.”’ Baptized this year at Victory

Baptist Church, Steele relies on her
* past experiences and a new faith to
» help her deal with the homeless, ‘‘her
friends who she is there to help.”’

Steele and McThenia don’t claim
+ full credit for the shelter saying it
was a community effort.

“‘T never dreamed so many people
y would be willing to help,” said Steele.

Many of the Lexington community
" churches have joined in the effort to
«help the homeless by giving money
and time.
Private citizens and companies
shave also joined in the remodling to

ture of the carefree, devil-may-care
attitude pervasive throughout Berlin
in the 1930s.”’

Approaching ‘‘Cabaret’’ concept-
ually came easily for Parker. In her
experience as an actress and direc-
tor, she has been very interested in
Brechtian theatre, an approach that
is not unlike the style of the current
production of ‘‘Cabaret.”’

“The mood of this style of theatre
is one of alienation,’ said Parker.
“In it, the actors confront the au-
dience, in effect bringing the stage
down to the audience and involving
them in the action. It’s quite unlike
musical comedy.”’

Brechtian theatre, said Parker,
began in Germany in the 1920s and
1930s, with the creation of the
“Berliner Ensemble.” This time
period provides the setting for
“Cabaret’’ as well.

For Radford, the show’s costume
designer, ‘‘Cabaret’” is no _ less
challenging. Her job was to create
designs that not only reflect the time
period and attitudes of pre-war
Berlin, but also have a ‘“‘punk-funk
look to them.”’

“‘The costumes have been designed
so that, while being slightly ana-
chronistic, they capture all that char-
acterized Berlin,’ said Radford.
From the nightclub costumes to the
stylized clothes of the Nazi youth,

The city council helped by waiving
the requirements to establish a
shelter, citing a cold weather
emergency until March, said Steele.

Local contractor Woody McDonald
and electrician Sid Brown have
donated their time and labor at cost
to remodel the house.

After the remodeling, Gladys said
that she will have her own part of the
house and there will be room for
about 10 cots upstairs.

Other important volunteers to the
project are the people who come over
and stay with the homeless at night
and make life easier for Gladys.

“At first Uncus (McThenia)
wanted it so I didn’t have to do
anything, but I wanted to be around
to help,” said Steele.

Steele said that she wanted to con-
tinue to do the cooking, stay around
during the day and be there at night if
her help was needed.

“T know alcholics, which most of
these people are, through no fault of
their own, and I want to be there
because I have the experience to help
them,” said Steele.

She relates most of the problems
people have with alcohol to the fami-
ly.
“If people could see and under-
stand the people I help, they would
know that arguing and fussing do no
good, but love and support does
help,” said Steele.

“T haven’t had any problems with
these people; they know and respect
my rules as well as me,” said Steele.

She has only three rules. Posted on
the wall next to the stairs they read:
“No alcohol or drugs in the house, no
firearms and no smoking above the
first floor.’’

“T have learned more about myself
since I started to deal with the
homeless,” said McThenia.

Both Steele and McThenia think

everything has been designed to be
similar to the original styles, yet ex-
aggerated to emphasize the unique-
ness of the time.

“Some of the costumes may be a
little advanced for this area, but they
remain accurate representations of
pre-war Berlin,’’ continued Radford.
“The nightclub outfits had to be
entertaining. They, like many of the
other costumes, are sensuous, but do
not cross over into vulgarity.”’

“If the members of the audience
bring anything away with them from

Snowstorm
damages
buildings

By GEORGE G. SPARACIO
Staff Reporter

 

 

Most of the damage to the
Washington and Lee campus from
the past snowstorms was caused by
melting snow. The buildings with the
most damage were Howe, DuPont
and Reid Halls.

James L. Arthur, the Superinten-
dent of Buildings and Grounds, said
that the reason for this problem is
that these particular buildings have
“secret” gutters, meaning that they
are hidden from view. Exposed gut-
ters, as are found on Washington and
Tucker Halls, are much more effi-
cient, but the style of the building
warranted ‘‘secret’’ gutters. Arthur
said that when the snow accumulated
on the roofs, it melted, then froze in
the gutters. The gutters pulled apart
with little drainage occuring. In addi-
tion, the icicles put a strain on the
gutters, causing some to fall down.

Reid Hall was the worst damaged,
according to Arthur. There is rain
leakage at least once a year accord-
ing to R.J. deMaria, Professor of
Journalism. There was leakage in
both the WLUR and Cable Nine
studios.

Two members of Cabaret rehearse a scene.

   

‘Cabaret,’ ’’ said Radford, “I hope it
would be a perspective of what Ger-
many was like in the 1930s. Its people
were futilely trying to escape from a
reality that surrounded them in their
daily lives.”

Local theatregoers will be able to
see the results of these professionals’
work when ‘‘Cabaret”’ is presented at
the university’s General Headquar-
ters Feb. 6 - 11, at 8 p.m. The show
will be preceded by a German-style
buffet that will include potato and
leek soup, rouladen (beef roll stuffed

Student workers wallpapered
Washington and Lee with band
posters earlier this week in a final ef-
fort to attract a big crowd for this
weekend’s Muscular Dystrophy
Association Superdance.

The ninth edition of W&L’s multi-
round fight against neuromuscular
diseases will begin with registration
at 7:30 a.m. Saturday. The 18-hour
dance marathon will begin at about 9
a.m. in the Student Activities
Pavilion.

Dancing will continue throughout
the morning, with breaks for special
events to keep the dancers moti-
vated. WLUR-FM will hold a 20-hour
radio marathon in honor of its 20th
anniversary, providing music for the
dancers and live interviews from the
pavilion. The radiothon will begin at
6a.m., and the disc jockeys will take
requests and dedications for a small
fee to be donated to the Muscular Dy-
strophy Association.

Although the admission price first
was reported at $8.50, adviser Fon-
tanne Bostic said the price will be on-
ly $8. Tickets are good for the entire
dance.

For those wishing to see the show
without partaking of the meal,
tickets will cost $3 for adults, and $2
for senior citizens and students. W&L
students, faculty, and staff are ad-
mitted free of charge. Reservations
and information can be obtained by

coustic trio from Charlottesville, will
kick off the live music at 1 p.m.
They'll be followed by Covacus at 7
p.m. and the very popular White
Animals at 10:15. They will perform
until about 1:30 a.m.

Pie throws begin at 9:30 p.m.

Bostic said that Associate Dean of
Students Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy”’ Atkins
and Lacrosse Coach Dennis Daly had
agreed to be on the receiving ends of
the pie tins. Other pie throws may be
added, Bostic said.

Organizers of the dance have set a
goal of raising $30,000 for MDA.

A year ago about 150 individuals
danced in the event, which raised
more than $34,000 for the Muscular
Dystrophy Association.

Superdanceco-chairmen Jim
Barker and Tom Thagard anticipate
that 300 dancers will participate in
this year’s event.

Various prizes, including trips to
the Virgin Islands, Georgetown, and
the Canaan Valley, will be awarded
to the dancers who receive the most
pledges.

Beer will be served to those of legal
drinking age. Proper college identi-
fication is required.

Further information about the
Superdance may be obtained by con-
tacting Bostic at 463-8448.

MY VIEW
By John T. Wiltse

It had been a long term and a long
drive home. It was hard to believe
that Christmas was only four days
away. I knew I would have to brave
the stores sooner or later — it could
wait to the afternoon, though. You
see, I always enjoy the first ‘sleep
in” of a break — no schedule, no
pressure, no classes. With a cup of
hot chocolate by my side, I began a
leisurely stroll through the morning
paper to get caught up on area news.

Then I saw the headline: ‘‘Newing-
ton Man, 21, Killed in Accident.” I
swalled hard before reading further
— even with 30,000 people in town
most names at least ring a bell. Sure
enough, it was Eric. We had gone all
through grade school together. He
went to a private Catholic high school
so I hadn’t seen him for over seven
years — nevertheless, this took me
by surprise. The article merely said
it was a one-car accident — I knew
the stretch of road, he was only a
minute from his house.

The calling hours were that after-
noon — what to do? It had been a long
time but something told me I should
go. Eric’s face and laugh were as
clear as if I had seen him yesterday.
His father was my music teacher
back in middle school and I also knew
one of his older brothers. Eric’s
father was always so proud of his
sons. Even if they wouldn’t recognize
me after all these years, Eric would
know I was there. He would do the
same for me. So, I went down to the
basement to get that suit I keep at
home for these times that aren’t
planned for. I’d go pay my respects
to Eric in between some of those
Christmas stops.

My mind kept drifting — how did
such a thing happen? My question
was answered by a high school
classmate I bumped into at one of the
stores. Her brother had responded to
the accident as a volunteer fireman.
Eric had tried to negotiate a curve at
over 80,m.p.h. and never made it -
the car blew up when it struck a tree.
He had been drinking with some of
his friends following a basketball
game at his alma mater.

As I signed my name at the funeral
home there was only one thought in
my mind — ‘‘what a waste.’’ My age.
A bright, pleasant individual. Only
four more months of college. Sudden-
ly, all my problems over the last thir-
teen weeks seemed so irrelevant.
Eric was dead. The look in his
parents’ eyes told the story —
Christmas would never be the same.
As I left, I thought about his friends
at Marquette University in Wiscon-
sin, wondering what they would think
when Eric didn’t return.

The question of why didn’t haunt
me, though. The answer was simple.
Eric didn’t care enough about
himself and those he left behind. And
the people he had been out drinking
with really weren’t friends. No one
had cared enough to look after Eric.
Clearly, there was a lack of love all
around.

What a waste. I took that suit back
down to the basement at the end of
the day. That’s the worst part
knowing that I will see the same
headline sometime in the future.
Damn, won’t we ever learn? Eric
would hope so.

Hoops rebounds from loss

 

By MIKE SHADY
Assistant Sports Editor

 

Just when your are about to give up
on this team they do something that
brings a smile to your face.

On the heels of a defeat to Hamden-
Sydney, a game the Generals should
have won, the Washington and Lee
basketball team rebounded nicely
two days later to beat the then 16th-
ranked Wasps of Emory and Henry,
82-73, last Thursday night in the
Warner Center.

Coupled with a 84-70 home victory
over Lynchburg last Saturday, the
Generals find themselves in fourth-
place in the Old Dominion Athletic

“We stayed within our of-
fense,”’said head coach Verne Can-
field, “‘and when it didn’t work, we
reset it.”

Senior Jefferson Harralson turned
in a performance that comes ex-
tremely close to perfection. His
numbers read 29 points on 11 of 12
shooting, 5 assists, 8 rebounds and
even a blocked shot to boot. What was
evev more impressive was how con-
trolled he was on the offensive end,
many times passing up good shots in
order to dish off to teammates for
easier baskets.

“We were very unselfish,’ said
Harralson. ‘‘It’s very fun to play that
way. This was a real big win for us.”’

The Generals won the game from

Official discrepancy

““Would you like to step outside?”

I looked at the owner of the voice that was questioning me. It belong-
ed to a gray-haired old man, say 55-years-old, who was extremely
overweight. To be honest with you, the guy was a fat ugly slob.

Yes, ladies and gentlemen, Our hero was suddenly face-to-face with
the worst possible danger known to mankind — an irate country bump-
kin whose hometown basketball team had just lost.

It was an interesting conversation, for the most part. He wanted to
know what my problem was. I wanted him to prove to me he had a
brain. Yes, it was definitely one hell of a conversation.

You see, the only reason for the confrontation was the fact that the
man’s behavior during the basketball game appalled me. And he
wasn’t the only one. There were several other so called adults in the
stands for the opposition as well who were behaving in much the same
fashion.

Their actions? Well, in their eyes, every (and I mean every) single
call the officials made against their team was absolutely wrong.
Phrases such as “‘you suck ref” and ‘‘you guys are really giving them
this one’ were some of the many priceless gems spewing from the
mouths of these people.

I’m sure you're asking ‘so what?’ and also hoping that this isn’t
some tirade saying that fans should sit in their seats and politely clap
after each point. Far from the point. The problem was not with the ex-
cessive ref-berating but more with the lack of support for the team
itself. Only a few (and I mean a few) times did these people ever cheer
for their own team. Isn’t that the sole reason for going to a basketball
game in the first place?

On the road, in a sparsely filled gym, is not the time nor the place 0
let the official know what you think of his mother. The recent game
was an embarrassment for the both the people making the comments
and the surrounding people who had to listen to them.

One of the officials who did the game summed it up best. During a
timeout late in the game, shouts and screams were echoing throughout
the quiet gym and most of them were directed at the officiating. I look-
ed at the ref and shaking my head asked him if he could believe what
was happening. He smiled at me and said he couldn’t believe these
people were adults and that the students were acting 100 percent bet-
ter. Usually its the students, not the parents, that yell the obscentities.

Which brings me to my final statement. When our students go to a
game, it is a totally different situation. Sure, sometimes insults fly,
foul language is used and officiating is seriously questioned. But these
things cannot be helped. What really counts is towards the end of the
game, our fans (mainly Fiji’s) know it is the players who need the sup-
port, not the guys in the pin-striped shirts.

My question to those ignorant fans? Does your basketball team ever
get beat, or is it always the officials’ fault when they lose?

NOTES: Did anyone (who is not brain dead) watch the Pro Bow] last
weekend? Baseball, basketball and hockey are bad enough, but does
anyone care about a sport when the season is already over’...
Fascinating piece on the Golden State Warriors’ Chris Washburn in
Sports Illustrated this week. I wonder who changes Chris’ diapers
when he’s on the road?... I don’t think there has ever been a broadcast
in which Dick Vitale hasn’t mentioned how great North Carolina and
head coach Dean Smith are. If I hear the phrase ‘Blue Heaven’”’

same amount of field goals. W&L
shot 90 percent (26 for 29), a much
improved statistic after some of their
recent efforts. The Generals led by as
little as three, 74-71, with two minutes
remaining, but some clutch free
throws by Harralson and sophomores
Lee Brading and Manny Klump iced
the game.

One could almost expect come sort
of an emotional letdown for the
Lynchburg game after Emory and
Henry. After all, Lynchburg came in-
to the contest dead last in the ODAC
with a 1-4 record. But W&L proved to
be too much for the over-matched
Hornets as the Generals slowly pull-
ed away throughout the game.

Brading led all scorers with 28
points, 18 of them coming in the sec-
ond half. W&L also received assis-
tance from a surprising source as
junior Lou Trosch poured in a career
high 16 points.

“Tt thought Lee and Lou played
very good games,” said Canfield,
“These guys have not been getting
the recognition that other people
have.”’

Lynchburg did expose the
General’s inability to defend a three-
point shooter. Peter Soens went 4 for
6 from downtown en route to his
team-loading 25 points.

“We’re still not zeroing in on the
Opposition’s potential three-point
shooters,” said Canfield.

Swimmers win three

 

By Hank Mayer/The Ring-tum Phi

Senior Jefferson Harralson shoots
a layup against Lynchburg.

 

From Staff Reports

 

Last week, the Washington and Lee
aquatics program enjoyed some

fast swims.

On Wednesday night both squads
squared up against Mary Washington
College, and again, the men won
while the women lost.

The men, now 7-1, swam exhibition
(non-scoring) for the second half of
the meet, and won 81-67. The Mary
Washington mens’ squad, however,
has more than tripled in size from
last year’s team of three.

Although the women lost to MWC,
124-84, they once again put on quite a
show. Led by sophomores Nancy
Whalen and Elizabeth Miles, the
women continued to swim personal
bests.

Miles qualified for Division III Na-
tionals in the 1650 yd. freestyle while
Whalen, who has been getting faster
every meet, broke the one minute
barrier that she has been aiming for
all season long.

Weekend wins against Shepherd
and Gettysburg brought the men’s
swimming team record to 6-1. The
women’s team beat Shepherd and
lost to Gettysburg to bring their
record to 4-3,

On Friday night, the men were im-
pressive against the against the

a

Shepherd Rams, whe upset the tra-
veling Generals last year, winning
88-58. Remillard said that the team
“‘was prepared, no matter how they
swam.” Shepherd was not the same
team as last year, having lost
several swimmers.

Against Shepherd, for the first time
ever, the W&L women had more
swimmers than the opposition. Rem-
illard said that ‘‘we took our licks last
year,” and the three-woman team of
Shepherd witnessed the turn-around
first hand.

Like the men, the Shepherd women
had lost a number of swimmers,
mainly to injury. It would seem that
even they couldn’t have helped, as
W&L won, 73-42.

On Saturday both teams faced the
Gettysburg Bullets, and the wins
were split. The men avenged last
year’s loss by a score of 117-68, while
the women lost to a sound Gettysburg
squad, 102-57.

The men’s varied line-up caught
the Bullets by surprise and Remil-
lard, who was looking for a close
meet, felt that his swimmers saw’
Gettysburg ‘‘crumble before our
eyes.”

The Generals won all but two of the
eleven individual races, and another
second in the 400 yard freestyle relay
to close out the meet.

Remillard said that it “‘was a great
whole meet.”

Wrestlers defeat Virginia State, 32-18

 

By DAVID EMRICH
Sports Editor

 

After two weeks of inactivity, due
at least partially to the big snow
storm, the Washington and Lee
wrestling team returned to the mats
this week with a win over Virginia
State and a home loss to Scranton.

Yesterday afternoon, the team
went on the road to Virginia State
and came away with a 32-18 victory.

Virginia State, for all intents and
purposes, spotted the Generals 12

team points at the start of the con-
test, forfeiting the first two bouts.

They were never able to climb out
of the hole, as the Generals added
wins from seniors Jeff Mazza (10-0),
Tim Walker (15-4), John Lowe (14-5),
and a technical fall by junior Steve
Castle.

Despite the win and the team’s im-
pressive record this season, W&L
head coach Gary Franke still
believes that there are things the
team could do better.

“We can still improve,” said
Franke. ‘‘We can become more cons-
cientious of the team score and what

our opponents are doing.”

Last Saturday, the Generals hosted
Scranton. The Scranton team proved
to be rude guests, beating W&L 32-15.

The meet was the first time the
Generals had seen action since Jan.
17th. The Generals were supposed to
host the W&L Invitational on Jan. 24,
but the snow put that tournament on
hold.

“As coaches we like to say that
type of thing [the inactivity] hurts
us,” said Franke. “‘Maybe that type
of break is more refreshing, maybe it
heals instead of hurts.”’

“T don’t think the layoff hurt us at

all,’’ concluded Franke.

Despite this, only three Generals
had their arms raised at the end of
their matches against Scranton, they
were Castle, who won by decision;
Mazza, who pinned his opponent; and
sophmore Richard Redfoot, who also
pinned his opponent.

“T ama little disappointed with the
way some of our wrestlers perform-
ed,’’ said Franke after the match.

This Saturday the Generals host a
triangular meet with Gallaudet and
Washington and Jefferson. The meet
starts at 1:00 p.m.

Individual performances highlight Relays

 

By JIM LAKE
Staff Reporter

 

The odds were certainly against a
record setting afternoon for Wash-
ington arid Lee’s Phillip Sampson in
the VMI Relays last Saturday.

The freshman pole vaulter knew
that the meet would feature Division
I athletes from throughout the south-
east. Consequently, Sampson said
that he really hadn’t expected to
place. “I just wanted to get up on the
pole and have a couple of godd
vaults. I wasn’t really intent on
vaulting really high. I just wanted to
get a little confidence.”’

Also, Sampson had twisted an
ankle while warming up for the start
of competition. ‘‘I was kind of unsure
about how my ankle was going to
hold up,”’ he said.

Nevertheless, Sampson set a
school record in the pole vault in his
first meet as a collegian, placing
fourth in the event by vaulting 14’-6”
a full six inches better than the school
record set by Gene Fellin nearly five

Head coach Norris Aldrige ‘was
really pleased” with Sampson’s per-
formance. Before the meet, “I
thought that he could clear 13-4,
maybe 14,”’ said Aldridge. ‘‘But now I
think that he’ll go even higher [than
14-6] before the year’s over.”

Looking at other W&L athletes, Al-
dridge said that he was also pleased
with the performance of Tom Mur-
ray. The senior was the only other
W&L athlete to place in the meet; he
took fourth in the shot put. Murray’s
last throw ‘‘was probably long
enough to get him third place, but he
scratched on it,”’ said Aldridge.

The Relays provided some of the
toughest competition that the
Generals will face all year, including
scholarship athletes from Clemson,
Virginia Tech, East Tennessee State,
and. many other Division I schools.
Aldrige said that he saw the meet as
a chance for his athletes ‘‘to get used
a ata al more than anything
e

In the running events, Aldridge
said that several W&L athletes per-

missed sixth place. Richard Moore
and Scott Rippeon ran well in the
distance events, and John White had
a “pretty good” 53.9 in the 400, he
said. “We had some good individual
performances for this early in the
season,” said Aldridge.

The W&L head coach said that the
field events featured good perfor-
mances for this early in the season,
said Aldridge.

tion,” said Aldridge. Old Dominion

Music, acting key to play

 

By CHRIS CARTER
Drama Critic

 

I'wo observations: First, one can-
not judge the outcome of a dramatic
production from observing a dress
rehearsal. Second, the first observa-
tion notwithstandanding, ‘‘Caberet,:
presented by the music and Drama
Divisions of the Department of Fine
Arts, should be an excellent show
Well-cast and thoughtfully directed,
if it turns out not to be the Drama
Department’s best-performed pro-
luction in the last few years,
Caberet”’ is certainly the most am-
bitious. Director Joseph Martinez
‘leverly decided to use W&L’s own
tavern, the GHQ, as the stage, since a
large part of the action takes place in
a Berlin night-club.

Set in Pre-War Nazi Germany,
‘Caberet’”’ uses the play within a
play technique in its depiction of two
very different couples in love, but
unable to marry. As one would ex-
pect, the play has serious political
implications; sometimes Martinez
overemphasizes these themes, for-
getting that the most persuasive peo-
ple are often the most subtle, but
generally, he keeps the hammer
from pounding the head too hard.

Ginger McNeese and Tibor Ed-
mond should please everyone with
their very fine portrayal of the elder-
ly Frauline Schneider and Herr
Schultz, whose engagement is cut-off
by her fear that she will suffer at the
hands of the Nazis for his being
Jewish. Both have a strong sense of
their characters and maintain them
throughout the show. The second cou-
ple, ex-patriot Americans Sally
Bowles and Clifford Bradshaw, pro-
vides a younger and philosophical
‘ounterweight to the older politically
motivated German couple. Greg
Lunsford is a welcome return to the
W&L stage, putting in his ever-
professional performance, and Nan-
*y Stone is. ort literally, amazing
in her depiction vi a night-club singer
who refused to believe that life is
more than a whirl of parties, lovers,
nd caberets.

Presiding over the entire show is

play upon which this musical is bas-
ed. And music is a key word here, by
the way. The singing is fine through-
out, though as always happens, just a
bit ragged in the big dance scenes.
The orchestra, made up of members
of the W&L Instrumental Ensemble
and directed by Professor Robert
Stewart has obviously worked long
and hard on what is clearly not the
easiest of music. The best-known
piece from ‘“‘Caberet’’ is, of course,
the ever-popular theme song, but
others, such as “Don’t Tell Mama,”
should also be a delight for
newcomers to the show. Finally, the
dancing, staged by professional
choreographer Dian Parker, is
vigorous and leaves no holds barred.
One of the main reasons one goes toa
real ‘‘Caberet’’ is, naturally, for the
scantily-clad dancers doing the Can-
Can; again, no one will be diasp-
pointed on this count

Criticisms? Well, its hard to say

since I did only see a dress rehearsal,
which is bound to be a bit rough yet.

I’m sure that by showtime, the kinks
in scene changes and music cues will
all be worked out. The make-up, how-
ever, may irritate some viewers. All
but the two couples are heavily made
up in a garish cross between Punk
chic and Barnum & Bailey: some-
times it’s rather effective, but I re-
main unconvinced. The same com-
ment might be made about director
Martinez’s decision to use slides to
reinforce the political message. It’s
not that they’re ineffective -- just
rather unnecessary. These are m‘~or
points, however, against the very
superior acting which is what really
sustains the show.

“Caberet’’ opens February 6 and
runs through the 11th. Since the show
is reported to be sold-out, you should
call and get on the waiting list now. A
German cuisine dinner is being serv-
ed before the show from 5:45 to 7:30,
and German beer will be served dur-
ing the two intermissions. If you
can’t make it to Vegas and a real
caberet anytime soon, ‘‘Caberet’’ is
not a bad substitute.

Beastie Boys: Bad belch humor

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Entertainment Editor

 

The Beastie Boys are this year’s
consumer rap-trap; a rock group
with a record, ‘“‘License To III,” that
is not music — not even, believe it or
not, interesting pop culture — but,
rather, a relentless, air-tight
marketing concept. It is a comedy
album that is not really all that fun-
ny. It is a record with no socially
redeeming qualities whatsoever.
(And remember, in the case of, say,
Van Halen, this used to be a compli-
ment

For those who don’t know already,
the Beastie Boys are currently the
hottest rap group in the country. Of
course, popularity among the rap
ranks lasts about as long as the life-
span of the fruit fly, but there you
have it. The Beastie Boys, however,
are different from the rest of the rap
rabble. Indeed, they have seized
upon a rock n’ roll truth that goes
back as far as Elvis: take a suc-
cessful black music genre, find some
white people to copy it, and then sell
the whole package to the suburbs.
It’s worked for the King, the Rolling
Stones, the Bee Gees, Madon-
na...stick with the tired and true.

But in addition to being white, the
Beastie Boys are also roughly the
same age as their audience. They
dress like their audience. They talk
like their audience. And after dows-
ing said audience with a six pack or
two of Budweiser, it is probably safe

to say the Beastie Boys even smell
like their audience.

What snotty-nosed fifteen year old
kid could resist? Why, the whole key
to the Beastie Boys is not that they’re
so great they deserve our respect,
but rather that they are so bad, so
normal, so obnoxious, it could be any
of us. (God forbid.) But this should,
of course, make you wonder why
anyone would want to shell out eight
dollars to hear a bunch of middle
class jerk-offs do what you or I could
do better, for free. Wonder indeed.

‘Aw, but where’s your sense of
humor?” you ask. Hey, I’ve got a
sense of humor; its these Beastie
Boys who are lacking in that depart-
ment. The funniest joke they’ve had
was wanting to call their record
“Don’t Be A Faggot.” (Their record
company vetoed the idea, incidental-
ly.) As it stands, ‘License To IIl’’ is
only funny if you’re the kind of per-
son who thinks a belch at the dinner
table is a laugh riot. And if that’s so,
don’t come eat at my house.

But let’s look at the record in ques-
tion. I listened to this whole thing, I
swear it. It wasn’t easy, but all thir-
teen tracks got a listen (although, I
must confess, by side two I began
playing ‘drop the needle’ quite a bit).
Another neat bit of marketing the
Beastie Boys have seized upon is that
fifteen year old kids go wild over
heavy metal, so that’s what much of
this record sounds like. Of course,
even heavy metal occasionally

   

boasts a melody (or at least a riff),
but the Beastie Boys couldn’t be
bothered with technicalities like that

This is a rap record, remember?

The raps concern, almost ex-
clusively, the Beastie Boys and all
that it means to be a Beastie Boy.
They like girls, drink Budweiser, doa
lot of angel dust, carry guns
(although pistols on this record
might also refer to a certain part of
the male anatomy, and vice versa),
hang out at White Castle, watch a lot
of television, and make a lot of
money. The hits are all here, if you
want them. ‘“‘Fight For Your Right”
(‘to party!’’ the Boys scream in a
drunken chant) has become some-
thing of the Buddy Atkins theme song
‘round here; ‘‘Paul Revere”’ is about
the only legitamately funny track on
the record; ‘Slow Ride,”’ with its
calypso horns, is the only one with a
hook; and ‘“‘Rhymin and Stealin’’ is
the only one, for some reason, that I
even liked.

Of course. ‘ecause the Beastie
Boys are such an easy-to-assemble
pop package, it won't be long before
every middle class, drunken, high
school drop-out has a rap record on
the charts. And that means that by
the time the Beastie Boys release
their second record, the appeal! will
have worn off. (See: the Knack) In
the meantime, if you must, find some
poor fool who has already bought this
platter and tape it from him. You can
always erase it ina few months.

Trustees vote to raise tuition

By MARGARET PIMBLETT
Staff Reporter

 

Tuition at Washington and Lee will
rise next year to $8,300, an increase
of 9.2 percent.

The Board of Trustees approved
the increase at its annual midwinter
meeting last weekend.

The increase in tuition raises the
comprehensive fee including tuition,
room, board and student activity fee
to $11,708, with an average room rent
of $1,383 and a 20-meal contract of
$1,925.

The trustees also approved the
largest financial aid budget in the

University’s history. W&L will award
a total of $2,973,000 in aid, drawing
primarily from restricted scholar-
ship endowment and gifts specified
for financial aid.

Tuition income does not fund the
student financial aid budget.

President John D. Wilson informed
parents of W&L students of the tui-
tion increase in a letter dated Feb. 11.
He said, ‘The Board considered
every reasonable option before adop-
ting next year’s tuition figure.”

Wilson also added that, in order to
protect the school’s assets, the
University uses a conservative for-
mula to decide how much of the en-
dowment earnings should be used for

Superdance is
big success

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Assignments Editor

 

Before 2 a.m. Sunday, no one knew
if Washington and Lee would surpass
its $30,000 goal at the school’s ninth-
annual Muscular Dystrophy Associa-
tion Superdance.

But when the final total was posted,
the answer was more than clear even
for the bleary-eyed at the Student Ac-
tivities Pavilion.

Bolstered by an outstanding turn-
out for the White Animals, students
this year raised $33,152. That figure
should once again make W&L one of

*“the’nation’s top per capita college

contributors to MDA.

Although it was not a record-
setting performance, this marked the
ninth straight year that W&L met its
goal. The record for a W&L Super-
dance is $35,200, set in 1984.

“IT am so proud of this year’s
chairmen and their committees,”’
said Fontanne Bostic, adviser to the
Superdance steering committee.
“The reason this year’s Superdance
was such a success was because their
organization was so great.”’

Bostic, Co-Chairmen Tom Thagard
and Jim Barker, and the other
organizers of the event had worried
that the increased drinking age
would hurt this year’s dance,
possibly making it dry. But a beer

license was granted a few weeks ago,
and their fears proved unwarranted.

They also shortened the dance
from 30 to 18 hours in an effort to at-
tract more dancers. Barker said
there were 160 dancers this year,
about 10 more than last year.

Margaret M. Pimblett, a soph-
omore from Newport News, Va., won
a trip to the Virgin Islands for collec-
ting the most pledge money. She said
she raised almost $950.

“I’m not sure how much money I
raised because I was still out getting
sponsors at fraternity parties Friday
night,’’ Pimblett said.

She was followed by Nicole
Liarakos, a freshman from Wil-
mington, Del., and Jeff Mandak, a
senior from Clifton, N.J.

Kenneth Craig Smith Jr. a
sophomore from Shreveport, La.,
won a prize for the most cash col-
lected.

Catherine M. Boardman, a soph-
omore from Bedford, Va., won the
raffle for a hydrobard.

Last year’s dance raised more than
$34,000, Barker said, but about $5,000
of that came from a car raffle. No car
raffle was held this year, he said, so
he was glad to be able to raise so
much.

The only negative part of the
dance, Barker said, was that some of
the dancers weren’t dancing, and
others left during the dance.

Freshman

is killed

in auto accident

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Assignments Editor

 

A Washington and Lee freshman
died early Tuesday morning in a
single-car accident on U.S. 11 north
of Natural Bridge.

Virginia State Trooper P.C. Gard-
ner said that Daniel E. Martin, 19, of
Lexington, Ky., was traveling south
at a high rate of speed when he lost
control of his car and skidded off the
right side of the road, three-tenths of
a mile north of the intersection of
U.S. 11 and Virginia 130.

Gardner said that Martin’s auto, a
1986 Nissan 300ZX, became airborne
and struck some trees. Martin, who
was not wearing a seatbelt, was
thrown from the vehicle and ap-
parently died on impact.

Gardner said that Martin was
found by a deputy sheriff at about

1:30 a.m. He estimated the time of .

the accident at 1:15.

He said he found no evidence that
alcohol was a factor. As is the case in
all accidents, a blood test is being
performed. Results are expected in a
week to ten days.

Dr. F.A. Feddeman, county medi-
cal examiner, said the cause of death
was a fractured neck

Martin, a 1985 graduate of Henry
Clay High School, was a pledge at the
Kappa Alpha fraternity. John K.
Hudson Jr., president of the house,
said he was told by fraternity
brothers that Martin had been there
until about midnight.

He said Martin had been drinking
beer and that some of the brothers
had asked him if he wanted a ride. He
said Martin told them that he was
alright and planned to return directly
to the dorms.

Mathew Laws, Martin's dorm
counselor, said that Martin would go

current needs. The effects of the 1986
tax reform bill on philanthropy are
yet to be seen, so the trustees con-
cluded that gift expectations should
not be overestimated, said Wilson

“The main sources of pressure on
the projected budget,’’ Wilson said,
“come from our decision to add key
new faculty positions, to improve our
national standing in compensation
for our faculty and staff, and to ac-
celerate the computer development
of the undergraduate schools and the
School of Law.”

The search to fill some of those new
faculty positions has already started,
according to Wilson. The positions in
clude professorships in Russian

 

history, art history, chemistry, and
business administration.

W&L’s 1985-86 combined salary
and benefits for faculty ranged for
$22,545 for instructors to $49,467 for
professors with an average compen-
sation of $41,846. Those figures com-
pare to average faculty compensa-
tion of $53,186 at Duke, $41,727
at Davidson, Hampden-Sydney’s
$33,820, and $51,799 at Princeton.

Wilson said that Washington and
Lee’s tuition and fees ‘tare amongst
the lowest in the nation when com-
pared with other independent institu-
tions of the first rank.”

In a guide published last year by
“The New York Times,’’ W&L was

named one of the ‘‘best buys’’ among
the nation’s colleges and univer-
sities,

The total charges for 1986-87 for
some other schools were:

eDavidson $11,075
«Georgetown $13,700
eHampden-Sydney $10,875
eUniversity of Richmond $10,075
*UVA (non resident ) $ 8,036
eWilliam and Mary $9,986

In his letter, Wilson also told the
parents about the general state of the
university.

more than 3,200 applications for the

an “Buddy” Atkins gets his just desserts.

He said that dancers who left and
came back were not admitted unless
they paid the $8 entry fee. He also
said that fewer dancers left than in
past years as a result of the shorten-
ed hours.

The dance began at 8 a.m. with
music from WLUR-FM, which held a

concurrent, 20-hour radio marathon.
WLUR staffers gave live reports
from the pavilion.

Speidel, Goodrich & Lille, an ac-
coustic trio from Charlottesville,

Wilson on state of the university

By PETER BOATNER
Staff Reporter

 

From the comfort of his suite of of-
fices in Washington Hall, President
Wilson’s view of the future for W&L

is bright indeed.
Reaction to co-education overall is
‘“‘positive,’’ fraternities are

“stronger than ever,” and W&L’s ap-
peal to high school seniors is ‘really
astonishing,’’ in Wilson’s view.

In an interview in the comfortable
green leather chairs of his office,
with WLUR’s morning classics show
playing softly in the background, he

Memorial Fund at W&l

 

outlined his perception of the major
issues facing the school today, and
tomorrow.

First and foremost, co-education is
a battle President Wilson thinks has
been fought and won at W&L.

“T think every visible sign is
positive,’’ Wilson said. ‘“There are, of
course, people who complain, but the
women are being accepted and the
men have been gracious in accepting
them...I received a letter (from a stu-
dent) just the other day saying how
he thinks co-education is strengthen-
ing the university.”

“You can’t have changes without a
few bumps, but if you look at last

year’s freshman class, of the 105
women who matriculated, 102 return-
ed. That’s a high retention rate.”

“T just don’t understand” the peo-
ple who complain against co-educa-
tion, such as in letters to the Phi, he
said. “I don’t know where they're
coming from.”’

“The women have been a positive
asset to the school. Look at the
sophomore women. They started a
soccer team last year, and they are
only a hundred of them...they’re very
aggresive.”

-OPINION

The Ring-tum Phi, February 12, 1987

 

Reasoning

Judging from the way he views the state of Washington and
Lee, it is obvious that Dr. Wilson views the University solely
from his office in Washington Hall, an office with rose-
colored windows.

Wilson is entitled to his views, but one wonders how he for-
mulates them. Rarely, these days, is the president seen walk-
ing around campus having informal chats with students to
discover what their opinions of his administration are. Many

‘students have valid criticisms of the way Washington and

' Lee is headed. The students with the strongest opinions ap-

: pear to be upperclassmen who have been witness to a

metamorphosis of a university. Does Dr. Wilson take their

opinions into account or does he dismiss them simply

because they are, for the most part, opponents of coeduca-
tion?

Washington and Lee is not an academic utopia and increas-
ing the size of the student body will not make it one.
_ The size of the student body is approaching what it was in
the mid 1970s. But the administration is going to have to come
. up with a better reason than that for continuing on this
course. To return Washington and Lee to what it was in the
1970s would mean the University would, once again, be all
- male. Is this what Dr. Wilson wants?

.  Theclass of 1991 will have 420 students in it. If the class size
» remains constant, within four years the size of the student
~ body would be 1680. If the law school is included, total enroll-
‘ ment approaches, if not surpasses, 2,000. This is a far cry
from the 1742 who went to Washington and Lee in the 1970s.

. Bigger is not always better. If Dr. Wilson and the ad-
ministration persist in their quest to enlarge what does not

-- need to be enlarged, they are going to have to come up with
~’ some damn good reasons for doing so.

‘Platoon’: just another Vietnam
movie? Or something else...?

 

MY VIEW
By Paul J. Smith

When it was over, I could not move.
My body was drained of all energy,
Shaken to its depths. I could do
nothing but stare, stare at a screen of
names, of tributes, to people who had
contributed to this monumental ef-
fort to heal America of her wounds.

On the surface, it was a rather sim-
ple story, a story of a young man
similar to any one of my classmates
who wanted to find his place in this
world, to find his purpose. Compelled
by idealism and zealous patriotism,
he rejects a rather secure and predic-
table life as a university student, for
a life of certain danger, of almost
certain death.

But this is more than a movie, I
think to myself, as the heavy laden
music continues. A woman two seats
in front of me is wiping her eyes. Did
she lose a loved one? A husband. A
father. I do not ask.

I doubt Ronald Reagan will watch
Platoon, or take it seriously. There is
no Star Spangled Banner to stir one
into patriotic euphoria. No flags, no
waving, no apple pie. Just the om-
nipresence of decaying bodies that
once possessed life, and the poignant
final scene where the bodies are be-
ing buried, like dead cockroaches, in-
to a huge impersonal hole.

“Is Platoon realistic?” I hear it
asked everywhere. But how can

someone in my generation know? We
never served in Vietnam. We are the
children of Vietnam, of a national
tragedy. Hazy to our minds are the
countless images of young men being
slaughtered in a horrendously hot
and humid tropical climate. Some-
what more clear are the memories of
the anti-war movement, protest mar-
ches held by university students who
through their money and power
would evade the draft anyway. Then
there was the violence at Kent State,
the ubiquitous slogans that
permeated the movement, ‘‘Hell No,
We won't go!”’, of the hippies who
would evolve into yuppies, of corrupt
well-dressed politicians.

It was a different era. It became
part of my history books. And now it
was gone, and except for occasional
reminders such as this movie, it
would leave my consciousness until
the next Vietnam movie came along.
Certainly, I thought to myself as I ex-
ited that theatre, we learned our
lesson this time. Certainly, I convinc-
ed myself, we wouldn’t make the
same mistake twice.

That night I went to sleep. I had a
dream. It was unlike any dream I
had before. It was remarkably clear
and vivid, with piercingly sharp im-
ages. I was aboard a helicopter tak-
ing off from a misty black tropical
forest which my eyes could not
penetrate. I was in uniform, with
weapon in hand. I could finally
ee ee ae

t

“John” reaches over and shouts that

we are landing; I can barely hear the
voices cround me and coming over the
radio, due to the roar of the engine.
“That's the enemy,” he shouts. I finally
recognize him. He is a classmate, who
majored in English. “How do you
know,” I shout back. “I can understand
what they are saying. I took four years
of Spanish.” Images are waxing and
fading in my eyes. I am disoriented. As
we land, | can make out the images of
tanks across the field.

The we all hear a voice. “Men,” the
voice proceeds, “We are here to serve as
advisors to our contra friends and aid

them against the struggle against the
communist menace.”

As we proceed to the line of departure
for the final inspection, I look around
and see thousands of my compatriots,
in uniforms, with weapons in hand. But
there are no faces. Just bodies, some-
how standing suspended in the air.
“They are dead,” says a spectating pea-
sant farmer. “They came here to die for
a cause their government could not pro-
ve, and for principles their government
did not itself believe. They were used.
Used. They died because old men in
high places were too proud to com-
promise. /Que lastima!” He turns away
and walks into the mist.

We are then ordered to pack the
bodies away, into the bags, to be ship-
ped home. There are few of us, many of
them. As we pack, we recognize some
who we once knew, some who wanted to
change this world, to somehow make it
better. For each body we see, we feel the
utter loss of one more dream shattered,
of one more set of hopes annihilated in.

 

to the oblivion of a pungent rotting
corpse.

“Oh God, why couldn't we have fore-
seen this. Why did we think it wouldn't”
happen to our generation.” John
laments, “Why did we let our govern-
ment do this to us?”

“God John, | don’t know. I just don't
know." I break down.

I cry out from my bed, waking in a
sheet soaked in sweat. My face is red,
my hands soaked. I look around my .
room, I see the familiar posters, the
pictures of family and friends. As I
suddenly remember the movie I had
seen the night before, my stomach
coils as though it were going to tie
itself into a knot.

Then it hits me like a wave of
thunder pounding against my head;
“Platoon” is not a movie about Viet-
nam. It is a warning. It is a warning
to all those who believe that the
government is right most of the time,
or even some of the time. It is a warn-
ing those willing to entrust their lives -
within a body of myopic policy-
makers who live in a fantasy world
within the Washington beltway
where the illusion of American invin-
cibility is fostered. It is a warning to
those who support the administra-
tion’s policies in Central America,
Iran, South Africa, Chile, South
Korea etc...and who don’t question °
the wisdom of such policies. It is a
warning against blind faith. As one

great American, Bruce Springsteen, |
said “It will get you killed.” You can
bet on it. As sure as the sun will rise
tomorrow.

Gordon’s

-MY VIEW
? By Susan Lewis

 

 

I must admit that I was thoroughly

*. surprised upon reading the letter to

the editor last week, “‘Reader no

. longer supports coeducation.’’ Last
‘. year I might not have been so shock-
. ed in seeing a letter like that, since
». feelings concerning coeducation
‘'. were much more pronounced. It is
». not that I object to anyone expressing

their opinion on coeducation and how

‘. it has been working out. Believe it or
» not, I, as a sophomore female, can
. understand that some peopie still
'. don’t and never will agree with the
. decision of July 15, 1985. I also can

respect their opinion and their view

» of Washington and Lee as it once was

— as long as their opinion is backed

up with sound, logical argument.

: Unfortunately, I honestly believe
: Mr. Gordon has no such argument. I
admit that I was slightly angry and
upset after my first reading of the let-
ter. But when I went back and reread
it, I was struck by its lack of
sensibility. In the first place, it seems
to me that a male on campus should
be just as insulted as females.
Perhaps I have been taking the
wrong classes, but I have yet to see
any males “cringe and blubber
dotingly, mesmerized by the
presence of their mother image three
seats over.’’.On the contrary, it has

- seemed tome that everyone has par-

ticipated equally in my classes — and
the males probably more so since
they are a larger percentage. I find it
exceedingly hard to believe, con-
sidering the caliber of the students at
this school, that women in a class-
room have such an adverse effect on
| men that the men can no longer think
‘or learn at all. Even if it were true, I
‘wouldn’t want all of the campus to
‘know that I can no longer concen-
‘trate simply because of someone of
‘the opposite sex was sitting in the
same room with me.
} Second, Mr. Gordon asks that the
tadministration take a _ refresher

course in Econ 101. Perhaps now is
the time to review yet again the
statistics behind his idea of supply
and demand for an all-male universi-
ty. (I know, I know, we have all heard
the statistics about this until we are
ready to scream, but obviously it
can’t hurt to say them once again.) A
low supply of any item yields a high
demand only if there is just that — a
high demand. Just because there is a
low supply does not guarantee a high
demand. In fact, there could be a low
supply because there is a low de-
mand — which is, I believe, the case
here. The numbers in both applica-
tions and enrollment show clearly
and without a doubt that the demand
for a prestegious coed university is
much, much higher than the demand
for a prestigious all-male university.

Finally, there is the question of the
comparison of W&L admitting
women to Coke changing its formula.
The Coca-Cola Company did indeed
realize they had made a mistake and
brought back Coke Classic. The pro-
blem here is that the public opinion in
favor of Coke Classic was over-
whelming, and the public opinion in
favor of ‘‘W&L Classic’’ does not ap-
pear to be. If it is, there certainly are
a number of people hiding in the
background and not voicing their
opinion. If Mr. Gordon is indeed
representing the majority student
opinion as he so firmly believes, then
why was this letter such a shock to
the women of W&L? As the “mis-
take” on campus, shouldn’t we have
realized that so many people regret-
ted and even resented our presence
here? I find it hard to believe that the
opinion of the student body is
represented in saying ‘‘Give us back
W&L Classic.”

I suppose that Mr. Gordon will not
listen to my arguments since I never
have been, nor deserve to be, but I
stand as having objected to his letter.
I object not only because his own
arguements are pointless and weak,
but also because I do consider myself
a part of this university. I love
Washington and Lee and what it
stands for no less than any male on
campus. Let Mr. Gordon scoff at my

presumptuousness if he must.

To the Editors:

It seems that this will be annual tradition.
Somme readers may recall my letter
decrying the action of the “participants” in the

Washington and Lee Muscular Dystrophy
Association Superdance.

Once again, this year I participated not in a
superdance, but in a super-spectate. The Super-
dance was publicized as an 18 hour dance
marathon, not 18 or fewer hours of sitting in the
Pavilion, making excuses for not moving.

The individuals who participated as registered
dancers had an obligation to their sponsors to at
least attempt to dance the entire 18 hours of the
event. True, many sponsors pledged a flat
amount rather than attaching a per-hour stipula-
tion, but those people generous enough to donate
their money to this very worthy cause rightfully
expected to have the dancers actually standing
up, perhaps even moving their feet in time with
the music. That should not mean only while the
bands are playing. It should include the time
when WLUR is broadcasting to the pavilion or
taped music is being played.

Some of the dancers complained about this
year's policy of requiring dancers who left the
pavilion to pay the regular admission price to re-
enter. Any dancer whe left forfeited his rights as
a registered participant-no free drinks, no free
food, and no admittance to the dancers’ ring.
Their sponsors were being charged for 18 hours
of dancing, not for six hours of dancing, six hours
of talking, and six hours of sleeping.

I realize that some of the young men who
registered to dance did so not out of the
of their altruistic principles, But were ‘“‘urged”’
by their fraternities to participate. A commen-
dable action, since the dance would most likely
lose thousands of dollars if those freshmen were
not required to obtain donations. However, I sub-
mit that those same fraternities should also
“urge” their pledges to dance, not just sit on the
bleachers or stand around conversing. It is possi-
ble to dance and talk at the same time.

I salute all the members of the Superdance
Steering Committee who worked for months
organizing the event, and particularly Jim
Baker and Tom Thagard, the co-chairmen. They
are to be applauded for surpassing their fun-
draising goal and raising more than $33,000 for
charity.

My sincere hope is that the W&L MDA Super-
dance will eventually live up to its name and
reputation and that its participants will truly
“Dance for those who can’t.”

Sincerely,
Margaret M. Pimblett, ’89

Reader wants all-male W&L

To the Editor

The mini-series ‘‘Amerika”’ details the horrors
of a Soviet occupation. Presumably, the drastic
changes the foreign domination force the
American people to revolt and resurrect the
status quo ante.

We can only hope that the W&L community

 

 

LETTERS

will rise against its occupation and liberate
itself. vr

As freshmen, w@were reminded that Gen. Lee
stated “Young , we have no printed
rules. We have but one rule here, and it is that
every student be a gentlemen.” That was
enough. That guided daily life here, and W&L
was a community based on gentlemanly trust,
mutual respect and comradeship. So happy were
those days that we grew complacent, and neede
some shaking up. After all, minds resistant to
positive change are stale, brittle.

What did we get? The shake-up shattered the
foundations upon which the school rested. Listen
to the results. A faculty member: ‘This place
has become so bureaucratized, like some state
school it is not... it is so un-W&L.” A 27-year staf-
fer: ‘There used to be comeraderie here, and we
don’t have it any more.” A student: “‘If it ain’t
broke, don’t fix it; why coeducation if the school
was a success before? We’re just another preten-
tious little school, with girls.”

New rules mean to protect us from ourselves,
not maintain order among gentleman. Is a W&L
student less capable of handling himself today
than, say, four years ago? He now must lock his
doors, hide his wallet, avoid kegs, attend date-
rape seminars to discover his innate violent,
predatory nature. And we thought the school
meant”’gentlemen.”’ Today we hear “Thou Shalt
Not,” and have to jump for our own good. So too
the faculty, which tires of petty administrative
interference.

Not long ago, even on a campus with 17 frater-
nities and diverse students, unity was a
hallmark. Snobbery and cliquishness were indiv-
dual aberrations. Now they are systemic. Up-
perclassmen remember when it wasn’t a social
sin to befriend a rival Greek or independant. (We
are forbidden to from open parties, as if in-
surance liability makes comradeship too
dangerous.) And how many cat-fights, girls,
over matters academic and honorable, social
and sexual? Truly, the new W&L fosters the com-
radship of the kindergarten; Gen. Lee be damn-
ed.

Let’s get some things straight.

Single-sex education is not sexist. It does not
promote a ‘‘separate-but-equal’”’ standard as if
girls were seoond-rate citizens.

Coeducation hasn’t enlightened the W&L man.
Instead it has brought sexism to Lexington and
embittered him.

Efforts to make girls feel at home, and that
they “‘improve”’ the school are insulting. The im-
plication is that we were selfish, or the old W&L
had no place in the 20th century.

Coeducation’s opponents are not misogynists,
closet homos, mama’s boys or chauvinists afraid
of women. To dismiss arguments forsingle-sex
education as fulminations by frustrated semi-
perverts and reactionaries misses the mark.

But that is now the standard response to any
efforts to intelligent discussion. This type of
name-calling would not have happened at the old
W4&L. Can you blame us for missing that institu-
tion?

“Washington and Lee enjoys freedom from
outside control. The university is free to chart its
own course, consistent with the highest educa-
tional standards, its traditions and its arms of
service to mankind.”’ (University Catalog)

The new era of outside - read un-W&L - control
is at hand. Those words are increasingly hollow.
To give them meaning again, students, faculty
and alumni should remove those people,at-

Superdancers are obligated to dance

titudes, and policies wrecking this institution.
Replace rules with trust. Reopen fraternitypar-
ties. Reanimate comeraderie. Repeal coeduca-
tion.

Shades is enlightened

To The Editors:

I have always been amused by Mike Shady’s
column “‘Shades On Sports.”’ In fact, I’ve alwavs
felt that his provincial, myopic insight has added
an almost fractional dimension to the W&L
paper.

What mortifies me though is Mr. Shady’s
judgemental attitude. I couldn’t actually bring
myself to believe that he finds yacht racing
anything less than exciting! Until I realized
where Mr. Shady is from. Pennsylvania! Mind
you, I have nothing against Pennsylvania; my
brother lives there. In Pittsburgh, no less! Mr.
Shady’s lack of appreciation for one of
America’s most heralded sports probably hinges
on the fact that his experience with the sea is pro-
bably limited to the rubber duck in his bathtub
and a three dollar box of salt water taffy from
Atlantic City.

I certainly hope that Mr. Shady’s column
didn’t wind up in the hands of Dennis Conner or
the San Diego Yacht Club. His days would be
numbered! In the future I would ask Mr. Shady
one favor before he writes his next column
fi off those damn sunglasses and see the
ight!

Lexington voters
may change laws

 

By MATHEW HORRIDGE
Staff Reporter

——

+ Lexington residents may be allow-
'

t ed to vote on a referendum repealing
F the city’s blue laws as early as June
if a bill that passed a Virginia Senate
F committee last week is signed by
Gov. Gerald Baliles.

The Senate Privileges and Elec-
tions Committee of the General
Assembly passed a bill that would
allow localities to hold referendums
to repeal the ..ue laws at any time if
the locality pays for the special elec-
tion.

The blue laws became an area
issue in December when the man-
ager of the Leggett’s store in the city
- complained to local authorities about
stores in the city and Rockbridge
County being opened on Sundays, in
defiance of the blue laws.

_ At the Jan. 8 Lexington City Coun-
cil. meeting, Frances Ruley and
several other Maxway Department
Store employees asked the council to
hold a special election in May to
repeal the laws that allow only the
sale of food and medicine and the
operation of service businesses, in-
cluding gas stations and towing
. trucks.

David Mertz, a former Maxway

manager, said at that meeting area

 

 

businesses would lose that $900,000 a
year because of Sunday closings.

State law currently allows referen-
dums to be placed on local ballots on-
ly during a general election on even-
numbered years. In that case, a blue
laws referendum could not be held in
Lexington until 1992.

Mrs. Ruley said she and several
other area merchants travelled to
Richmond last week to support the
bill introduced by Sen. Frank Nolen.
The bill now goes to the Senate floor
and then to the House of Delegates.

In order to place a referendum on
an election ballot, a petition contain-
ing 10 percent of a_ locality’s
registered voters must be submitted
to the local judge at least 60 days
prior to the election date. Mrs. Ruley
said she has collected many more
than the 650 names required for a
referendum to be placed on the Lex-
ington ballot.

Although Rockbridge County was
named in Leggett’s complaint about
blue law violators, there has not been
a drive to get signatures for a petition
in the county.

Mrs. Ruley said she would pro-
bably not submit a request for a
referendum until May to ensure she
has enough support for the measure
to pass. This would mean that an
election could not be held until July.

In 1980, Buena Vista residents ap-

proved a referendum repealing the
blue laws by 100 votes.

“(The city council) is willing to
have the election as soon as possi-
ble,’’ Mrs. Ruley said.

In the mean time, local merchants
have been asked to abide by the
codes. Violation of the blue law can
result in fines up to $1,000 and/or one
year in jail. Thus far, no arrests have
been reported in either the city or
Rockbridge County.

Lt. Bruce M. Beard, acting chief of
the Lexington Police Department,
said he hadn't heard anything about
the blue laws in his 17-year police
career until December. Beard said
periodic checks would be made at the
city’s stores to make sure merchants
are obeying the blue laws.

   

 

By Perry S. Hayes/The Ring-tum Phi

Maxway’s new manager, Barry
Guffery, said he was not allowed to
say exactly how much money the
store was losing because of Sunday
closings but he did say the figure ac-
counted for 15 percent of its weekly
earnings. In addition, he said, the
closings forced the store to lay off
four employees.

Mertz said onc of the inequities of
the blue law is that stores such as
Maxway and Rose’s must be closed
on Sundays but drugstores, like
Super X, can remain open and sell
many non-prescription items.

Mrs. Ruley said many store owners
in the area, including the owners of
the Ladies’ Habit, College Towne
Shoppe and Pink ‘n’ Blue, are in
favor of being open on Sundays.

 

Sally Mann is a tradition breaker

Like her photos, Sally Mann evokes
different images in different people.

To Lexingtonians she is the person
With the weird sculpture in her front

New breed of avant-grade photog-
Taphers. And to many others she is
the photographer with the big, old
Camera they have seen in many
Newspapers recently.

And Sally Mann is also a lot of
things to Sally Mann: photographer,
Mother and tradition breaker.

Mann recently had an exhibit in the

duPont Gallery at Washington

Silent Thought,” was a collection of
stark black-and-white. prints: of -12-
year-old girls.

1982 and 1986 in this area but were ex-

Of the many Supreme Court cases
Ynvolving the conflict between free

“e mond Newspapers Inc. v. Virginia.

Not only did the Richmond case
arantee the right of the public and

Mbut it also helped unmuddy the

Me ters created by the Gannett v.
DePasquale decision of 1979.

>For these reasons, J. Stewart

selimes-Dispatch and News Leader,
iwas presented the 1987 First Amend-
ment’ Award last week by the

Bryan who led Richmond News-
papers, Inc. into this important court
battle. As SDX adviser Clark R.
Mollenhoff noted, Bryan’s efforts
was especially commendable be-
cause the Richmond papers had
nothing direct to gain from the case.

After receiving his award; Bryan
discussed the case with journalism
students, professors and other
members of the W&L community ina
30-minute lecture in duPon Audi-
torium.

In Gannett v. DePasquale, a divid-
ed court found that the press and
public had no Sixth Amendment right
to attend pretrial suppression hear-
ings closed by agreement of the pro-
secution and defense. But some
judges interpreted the decision to
mean that they could close trials, too,
and an estimated 270 closure motions
were made in the 12 months between
the Gannett and Richmond decisions.

 

 

 

 

Rhona Hughes

Butler said the Board was impress-
ed with her interview because ‘“‘she
handled herself well and came up
with all of the things we thought
needed to be done.’ Hughes’ ex-
perience from working on the staff
selling ads also helped her “‘to know
what needed to be done and how to do
it,’’ said Butler.

Hughes’ responsibilities will in-
clude billing, selling ads and paying
the printing costs, She is also now a
member of the Publications Board.
She will also be responsible for the
management of the Phi’s finances
and budget. If the Phi ‘‘continues the
way it is going now, everything (the
budget) will be fine,’’ commented
John Pensec, the Phi’s News Editor.

 

The Richmond case was decided
exactly a year after the Gannett deci-
sion. Bryan said that although hiring
lawyers for such a case was expen-
sive, he thought he had an obligation
to take the case to court.

As Bryan explained, reporters for
the Times-Dispatch and News
Leader were covering a murder
retrial in Hanover County Circuit
Court. The accused earlier had been
convicted in that court, but the
Virginia Supreme Court reversed the
conviction, ruling that inadmissible
evidence had been introduced. The
case already had been retried twice,
both times ending in mistrials.

Before the start of the fourth trial,
the defense counsel requested that

’ the trial be closed. The prosecution

had no objections.

But the two newspaper reporters
did. After the judge refused to reopen
the trial, they appealed the case to

Ruscio to

the Virginia Supreme Court, which
turned them down. But the U.S.
Supreme Court did agree to hear the
case. Writing for the majority, Chief
Justice Warren Burger found that
“absent an overriding interest ar-
ticulated in findings, the trial of a
criminal case must be open to the
public.”

This means that.the public and
press do have the right to attend
criminal trials under the First and
Fourteenth Amendments unless all
other alternatives guaranteeing a
fair trial have been tested and found
unsatisfactory. These alternatives
include moving the trial, bringing in
an outside jury, holding the trial at a
later date and sequestering the jury.

Only Justice William Rehnquist,
now the chief justice, dissented.
Justice Lewis F. Powell, a W&L
graduate, did not participate in the
Richmond decision.

Grant awarded

to Beckley

 

From Staff Reports

 

Harlan R. Beckley, associate pro-
fessor of religion at Washington and
Lee, has been awarded a National
Endowment for the Humanities Fel-
lowship for College Teachers and In-
dependent Scholars.

Beckley is the second W&L pro-
fessor in two years to receive the
prestigious research grant. Edwin D.
Craun, professor of English, was
awarded a grant for the current
academic year.

The NEH grants support indepen-
dent study projects in the human-
ities. Beckley will conduct his
research on “‘Justice in the Thought
of Walter Rauschenbusch, John A.
Ryan and Reinhold Niebuhr,” during
the 1987-88 academic year, when he
plans to be on sabbatical leave.

“These three stand apart from
other Christian ethicists in the first
half of the 20th century for their in-
fluence upon Christian thought and
practice and for their impace upon
public policy in the United States,”
Beckley said. He plans to publish a
book on the topic.

Beckley has been studying the
theories of justice of the three
theologians, drawing from their
writings and studies of their
thoughts, lives and times. Beckley
will ‘‘trace the development and ap-
plication of theologians’ theories of

justice in the context of the intellec-
tual and political movements of the
time to which the men were respon-
ding.”

Beckley’s project will build on
previous studies and essays on
religious ethics and justice, including
a recent two-part article, ‘A Chris-
tian Affirmation of John Rawls’s
Idea of Justice as Fairness,’’ which
was published in “The Journal of
Religious Ethics’’ in the fall of 1985
and the fall of 1986.

Prior to joining the Washington
and Lee faculty in 1974, Beckley serv-
ed as pastor of the Kingston Springs
United Methodist Charge, where he
served three churches in Kingston
Springs, Tenn. He received his B.S.
degree from the Unitersity of Illinois,
his M. Div. from Vanderbilt Divinity
School, and his M.A. and Ph.D.
degrees from Vanderbilt University.

Beckley was awarded an Andrew
W. Mellon Foundation Grant and was
a Research Fellow in 1981-82 for Ad-
vanced Study of Religion at the
University of Chicago. He has receiv-
ed numerous Glenn Grants from
Washington and Lee for summer
research.

While Beckley is on sabbatical next
year, Neville Richardson of the
University of Natal in Pietermaritz-

burg, South Africa, will teach
courses on theology and ethics and
South African religion.

Pest scam is

 

From The Associated Press

 

The 71-year-old head of a family
that ran a fraudulent pest exter-
minator scheme along the East Coast
for 30 years was sentenced to five
years in prison.

The sentence Monday was the sec-
ond conviction in Virginia for Robert

Matthew Bales of Wilburn, Fla., who.
was sentenced to 14 years in prison in..

Staunton on similar convictions last
year and faces other charges in Bath
County. Monday’s sentence will run
consecutively with any other
said‘. Circuit

Judge George E. Honts III.. Bales -

pleaded guilty in December to 35
charges of obtaining money by false
pretenses.

Testimony in December showed
Bales’ crew planted insects in the
homes of elderly people during free
inspections, then charged large fees
to rid the house of insects. Bales was
ordered to pay his Rockbridge Coun-
ty customers $14,603 in restitution.

“*You preyed on the aged, the weak
and the vulnerable,”’ the judge told
Bales. Because Bales is old, he

+ j/uncovered
“

should have been more sympathetic
to his victims, Honts said.

Bales, whose son and grandsons
also have been convicted of exter-
mination fraud here and in other
Virginia localities, testified Monday
that he brought his business to
Virginia in 1985 after being charged
with similar offenses in Florida.

His grandson, James M. ‘‘Mickey”’
.Quattlebaum Jr., who has testified
-for.,: prosecutors ip hundreds .of
charges against Bales and Quat-

tlebaum’s father, brothers and co- |

workers, said in interviews last year |
that he and other crew members |
sometimes charged old people}

thousands of dollars for unwarranted

_ and poorly executed work.

Quattlebaum, convicted with the
others, estimated that the group
made between $350,000 and $400,000
in Virginia in 1985. Police estimate |
over 600 people in about 13 Virginia |
counties were victimized.

Quattlebaum said the family had|
been operating the scam for about 30
years in the Southeast. |

INTENTIONAL SECOND EXPOSURE

The Ring-tum Phi, February 12, 1987

 

Reasoning

Judging from the way he views the state of Washington and
Lee, it is obvious that Dr. Wilson views the University solely
from his office in Washington Hall, an office with rose-

_ colored windows.

Wilson is entitled to his views, but one wonders how he for-
“*" mulates them. Rarely, these days, is the president seen walk-
ing around campus having informal chats with students to
discover what their opinions of his administration are. Many

_ students have valid criticisms of the way Washington and

The class of 1991 will have 420 students in it. If the class size

‘Platoon’: just another Vietnam

MY VIEW
By Paul J. Smith

When it was over, I could not move.
My body was drained of all energy,
shaken to its depths. I could do
nothing but stare, stare at a screen of
names, of tributes, to people who had
contributed to this monumental ef-
fort to heal America of her wounds.

On the surface, it was a rather sim-

“Ig Platoon realistic?” I hear it
asked everywhere. But how can

someone in my generation know? We
never served in Vietnam. We are the
children of Vietnam, of a national
tragedy. Hazy to our minds are the
countless images of young men being
slaughtered in a horrendously hot
and humid tropical climate. Some-
what more clear are the memories of
the anti-war movement, protest mar-
ches held by university students who
through their money and power
would evade the draft anyway. Then
there was the violence at Kent State,
the ubiquitous slogans that
permeated the movement, ‘‘Hell No,
We won't go!”, of the hippies who

voices around me and coming over the
radio, due to the roar of the engine.
“That's the enemy,” he shouts. I finally
recognize him. He is a classmate, who
majored in English. “How do you
know,” I shout back. “I can understand
what they are saying. I took four years
of Spanish.” Images are waxing and
fading in my eyes. I am disoriented. As
we land, I can make out the images of
tanks across the field.

The we all hear a voice. “Men,” the
voice proceeds, “We are here to serve as
advisors to our contra friends and aid
them against the struggle against the
communist menace.”

As we proceed to the line of departure
for the final inspection, | look around
and see thousands of my compatriots,
in uniforms, with weapons in hand. But
there are no faces. Just bodies, some-
how standing suspended in the air.
“They are dead,” says a spectating pea-
sant farmer. “They came here to die for
@ cause their government could not pro-
ve, and for principles their government
did not itself believe. They were used.
Used, They died because old men in
high places were too proud to com-
promise. /Que lastima!” He turns away
and walks into the mist.

We are then ordered to pack the
bodies away, into the bags, to be ship-
ped home. There are few of us, many of
them. As we pack, we recognize some
who we once knew, some who wanted to

change this world, to somehow make it grea'

better. For each body we see, we feel the
utter loss of one more dream shattered,
of one more set of hopes annihilated in.

corpse.

seen this. Why did we think it wouldn't '
happen to our generation.” John :
laments, “Why did we let our govern- |

ment do this to us?”

“God John, I don't know. I just don't

know.” I break down.

I cry out from my bed, waking in a

sheet soaked in sweat. My face is red,

my hands soaked. I look around my «

room, I see the familiar posters, the

pictures of family and friends. As I °
suddenly remember the movie I had ,

seen the night before, my stomach

coils as though it were going to tie

itself into a knot.

of their altruistic principles, But were “urged”
by their fraternities to . A commen-

I salute all the members of the Superdance

reputation and that its participants will truly

What did we get? The shake-up shattered the
foundations upon which the school rested. Listen
to the results. A faculty member: ‘This place
has become so bureaucratized, like some state
school it is not... it is so un-W&L.”’ A 27-year staf-
fer: ‘There used to be comeraderie here, and we
don’t have it any more.” A student: “If it ain’t
broke, don’t fix it; why coeducation if the school
was a success before? We’re just another preten-
tious little school, with girls.”

New rules mean to protect us from ourselves,
not maintain order among gentleman. Is a W&L
student less capable of handling himself today
than, say, four years ago? He now must lock his
doors, hide his wallet, avoid kegs, attend date-
rape seminars to discover his innate violent,
predatory nature. And we thought the school
meant” gentlemen.” Today we hear “Thou Shalt

surance liability makes comradeship too
dangerous.) And how many cat-fights, girls,
over matters academic and honorable, social
and sexual? Truly, the new W&L fosters the com-

Let’s get some things straight.

Single-sex education is not sexist. It does not
promote a “‘separate-but-equal” standard as if
girls were seoond-rate citizens.

Coeducation hasn’t enlightened the W&L man.
Instead it has brought sexism to Lexington and
embittered him.

Efforts to make girls feel at home, and that
they “‘improve’’ the school are insulting. The im-
plication ir that we were selfish, or the old W&L
had no place in the 20th century.

Coeducation’s opponents are not misogynists,
closet homos, mama’s boys or chauvinists afraid
of women. To dismiss arguments forsingle-sex
education as fulminations by frustrated semi-
perverts and reactionaries misses the mark.

But that is now the standard response to any
efforts to intelligent discussion. This type of
name-calling would not have happened at the old
Wet. Con you blame us for missing that institu-
tion?

“Washington and Lee enjoys freedom from
outside control. The university is free to chart its
own course, consistent with the highest educa-
tional standards, its traditions and its arms of
service to mankind.”’ (University Catalog)

The new era of outside - read un-W&L - control
is at hand. Those words are increasingly hollow.

and alumni should remove those people,at-

To The Editors:

I have always been amused by Mike Shady’s
column ‘Shades On Sports.”’ In fact, I’ve alwavs
felt that his provincial, myopic insight has added
an almost fractional dimension to the W&L
paper.

What mortifies me though is Mr. Shady’s
judgemental attitude. 1 couldn't actually bring
myself to believe that he finds yacht racing
anything less than exciting! Until I realized
where Mr. Shady is from. Pennsylvania! Mind
you, I have nothing against Pennsylvania; my
brother lives there. In Pittsburgh, no less! Mr.
Shady’s lack of appreciation for one of
America's most heralded sports probably hinges
on the fact that his experience with the sea is pro-
bably limited to the rubber duck in his bathtub
and a three dollar box of salt water taffy from
Atlantic City.

I certainly hope that Mr. Shady’s column
didn’t wind up in the hands of Dennis Conner or
the San Diego Yacht Club. His days would be
numbered! In the future I would ask Mr. Shady

Lexington voters
may change laws

 

By MATHEW HORRIDGE
Staff Reporter

Lexington residents may be allow-
ed to vote on a referendum repealing
the city’s blue laws as early as June
if a bill that passed a Virginia Senate
committee last week is signed by
‘Gov. Gerald Baliles.

The Senate Privileges and Elec-
‘tions Committee of the General
Assembly passed a bill that would
‘allow localities to hold referendums
to repeal the ..ue laws at any time if
"the locality pays for the special elec-
tion.

* The blue laws became an area

“ager of the Leggett’s store in the city

Sally Mann Is a a tradition breaker

Like her photos, Sally Mann evokes
different images in different people.

To Lexingtonians she is the person
with the weird sculpture in her front
yard. To New Yorkers she is one of a
New breed of avant-grade photog-
Taphers. And to many others she is
the photographer with the big, old
Camera they have seen in many
Newspapers recently.

And Sally Mann is also a lot of
things to Sally Mann: photographer,
Mother and tradition breaker.

Mann recently had an exhibit in the

State law currently allows referen-
dums to be placed on local ballots on-
ly during a general election on even-
numbered years. In that case, a blue
laws referendum could not be held in
Lexington until 1992.

Mrs. Ruley said she and several
other area merchants travelled to
Richmond last week to support the
bill introduced by Sen. Frank Nolen.
The bill now goes to the Senate floor
and then to the House of Delegates.

In order to place a referendum on
an election ballot, a petition contain-
ing 10 percent of a_ locality’s
registered voters must be submitted
to the local judge at least 60 days
prior to the election date. Mrs. Ruley
said she has collected many more
than the 650 names required for a
referendum to be placed on the Lex-
ington ballot.

Although Rockbridge County was
named in Leggett’s complaint about
blue law violators, there has not been
a drive to get signatures for a petition
in the county.

Mrs. Ruley said she would pro-
bably not submit a request for a
referendum until May to ensure she
has enough support for the measure
to pass. This would mean that an
election could not be held until July.

ings closed by agreement of the pro- °

judges interpreted the decision to
mean that they could close trials, too,
and an estimated 270 closure motions
were made in the 12 months between
the Gannett and Richmond decisions.

She will also be responsible for the

blue laws by 100 votes.

“(The city council) is willing to
have the election as soon as possi-
ble,”’ Mrs. Ruley said.

In the mean time, local merchants
have been asked to abide by the
codes. Violation of the blue law can
result in fines up to $1,000 and/or one
year in jail. Thus far, no arrests have
been reported in either the city or
Rockbridge County.

Lt. Bruce M. Beard, acting chief of
the Lexington Police Department,
said he hadn't heard anything about
the blue laws in his 17-year police
career until December. Beard said
periodic checks would be made at the
city’s stores to make sure merchants
are obeying the blue laws.

Maxway’s new manager, Barry
Guffery, said he was not allowed to
say exactly how much money the
store was losing because of Sunday
closings but he did say the figure ac-
counted for 15 percent of its weekly
earnings. In addition, he said, the
closings forced the store to lay off
four employees.

Mertz said onc of the inequities of
the blue law is that stores such as
Maxway and Rose’s must be closed
on Sundays but drugstores, like
Super X, can remain open and sell
many non-prescription items.

Mrs. Ruley said many store owners
in the area, including the owners of
the Ladies’ Habit, College Towne
Shoppe and Pink ‘n’ Blue, are in
favor of being open on Sundays.

 

The Richmond case was decided
exactly a year after the Gannett deci-
sion. Bryan said that although hiring
lawyers for such a case was expen-
sive, he thought he had an obligation
to take the case to court.

As Bryan explained, reporters for

Court. The accused earlier had been

Virginia Supreme Court reversed the
conviction, ruling that inadmissible

both times ending in mistrials.

Sorry, bud due to the Grant awarded

Curforce men} of the Blue Laws |

to Beckley

 

From Staff Reports

 

Harlan R. Beckley, associate pro-
fessor of religion at Washington and
Lee, has been awarded a National
Endowment for the Humanities Fel-
lowship for College Teachers and In-
dependent Scholars.

Beckley is the second W&L pro-
fessor in two years to receive the
prestigious research grant. Edwin D.
Craun, professor of English, was
awarded a grant for the current
academic year.

The NEH grants support indepen-
dent study projects in the human-
ities. Beckley will conduct his
research on ‘‘Justice in the Thought
of Walter Rauschenbusch, John A.
Ryan and Reinhold Niebuhr,’’ during
the 1987-88 academic year, when he
plans to be on sabbatical leave.

“These three stand apart from
other Christian ethicists in the first
half of the 20th century for their in-
fluence upon Christian thought and
practice and for their impace upon
public policy in the United States,”
Beckley said. He plans to publish a
book on the topic.

Beckley has been studying the
theories of justice of the three
theologians, drawing from their
writings and studies of their
thoughts, lives and times. Beckley
will “trace the development and ap-
plication of theologians’ theories of

justice in the context of the intellec-
tual and political movements of the
time to which the men were respon-
ding.”

Beckley’s project will build on
previous studies and essays on
religious ethics and justice, including
a recent two-part article, ‘‘A Chris-
tian Affirmation of John Rawls’s
Idea of Justice as Fairness,’’ which
was published in ‘“‘The Journal of
Religious Ethics” in the fall of 1985
and the fall of 1986.

Prior to joining the Washington
and Lee faculty in 1974, Beckley serv-
ed as pastor of the Kingston Springs
United Methodist Charge, where he
served three churches in Kingston
Springs, Tenn. He received his B.S.
degree from the Unitersity of Illinois,
his M. Div. from Vanderbilt Divinity
School, and his M.A. and Ph.D.
degrees from Vanderbilt University.

Beckley was awarded an Andrew
W. Mellon Foundation Grant and was
a Research Fellow in 1981-82 for Ad-
vanced Study of Religion at the
University of Chicago. He has receiv-
ed numerous Glenn Grants from
Washington and Lee for summer
research.

While Beckley is on sabbatical next
year, Neville Richardson of the
University of Natal in Pietermaritz-
burg, South Africa, will teach
courses on theology and ethics and
South African religion.

There is a celebration going on in
Reid Hall this year. 1987 is the twen-

tieth year anniversary of WLUR, the
Washington and Lee campus radio
station. Found at 91.5 on the FM
radio dial, WLUR has grown and
developed throughout its twenty year
existence.

On November 1, 1966, the Federal
Communications Commission grant-
ed Washington and Lee a construc-
tion permit for a new Class D, non-
commercial, educational FM broad-
casting station of ten watts power.
This permit opened the door to begin
WLUR. An area on the third floor of
Reid Hall was designated as the site
of the new radio station and a thirty
foot antenna was assembled on the
roof. The broadcasting studio was
equipped with a type FM-22 transmit:

ment to the WLUR’ project. :
automatic cartridge tape playback, a
variety of tape cartridges, micro-
phones, an AM/FM tuner and four
thousand LP recordings were also
obtained for the station: And, along
with the broadcasting station, tape
and record libraries and a news room
complete with Associated Press
wires were set up in Reid Hall for use
by radio personnel.

When WLUR began, the station
manager was Charles E. Winston
and the Chief Engineer was J. Ed
Newman. On Tuesday, January 3ist,
Newman ran a series of equipment
tests with the new WLUR facilities.

_ The station operated smoothly within

plus or minus twenty thousand cycles
to its assigned frequency of 91.5

. Megacycles.

After taking a survey of the cam-

pus and Lexington, the officers of
‘ WLUR discovered that the most

wanted program was a classical

: music show followed by Broadway

and movie scores and news pro-
grams respectively. With this infor- -

. mation in mind, WLUR-FM began its

regular schedule of ‘broadcasts on
February 25, 1967..:The - station’s
hours of operation were 7:00 to 11:00
p.m., Monday through Friday.

John K. Jennings, ’56, professor of
Journalism today, returned to

An™ : Washington and Lee after graduate

school a year after WLUR started
operating. He remembers the station
as much smaller with less broad-
casting time but still well supported
by the University and community.

In 1977, Robert deMaria was hired
to work on WLUR and is still the
General Manager and Journalism
Department representative . of
WLUR. When he arrived at W&L,
deMaria found the station somewhat
chaotic. In previous years, there had
been numerous General: Managers
who were not consistent. However,
deMaria has been a member of the
WLUR community for nine years,
and he is in charge of the biggest
staff ever to work on the radio sta-

_, tion.

Since deMaria’ s arrival at WLUR,

the station has acquired almost all

new equipment including a compact
disk player two years ago. Although

». the. station is in need of a: new
‘transmitter,-a twenty-five thousand

dollar “project, deMaria feel that
WLUR has ‘“‘state_of the art equip-
ment.” The station has grown and
prospered. » For. example, - in 1977,
WLUR™ had three: hundred — jazz
albums; now there are over four
thousand LP’s in the jazz collection.

students to add the late-night ‘Third

. over the reigns to another professor,

Jeryl Davis, who was replaced by de
Maria in 1977.
De Maria said the station was very

unorganized when he came on board. -

He improved the schedule, which
consisted of blocks of jazz, classics,
rock, news and public ’ affairs
programming at specific times dur-.
ing the day.

“Tt still serves mainly as an educa-

Today, about 30 percent of the
programming is classics. Another 30

The most popular music programs
on WLUR include Classical Show-
case, Third Ear, Afternoon Rock,
Oldies and Skyline Jazz. The music
that is played on WLUR is closely
monitored and carefully screened.
The staff of WLUR is in contact with
record companies that deMaria
thinks ‘‘will be supportive as long as
we play their music, keep in touch
and let them know what we are do-
ing.” WLUR follows a playlist from
‘College Media Journal”’ and at least
half of all shows contain new music.

Another growing part of WLUR is
its new department. Although most
news is obtained from the Associated
Press, this is the first year that on-
the-spot radio reporting has been
successful. Monday through Friday,
a different story is reported on by a
Washington and Lee student. This
project works in correlation with the
Journalism Department ‘and the
reporters earn one credit each.

““McNews”’ — Timothy G. McNews.

A record buff since the time he

on the Gong Show at the age of 10 by
impersonating a dead president. As a

he was very involved in acting and

Sail has shown that people in

Students are in class at those times

Late afternoon is an excellent time
for rock because it attracts both col-
lege and high school students, be
said. The station is run by W&L, but
it is licensed to serve Lexington and
Rockbridge County. So the program-
ming must serve more than just the
W&L students.

The evening music schedule begins
with classics, followed by pro-

the eclectic Third Ear from midnight

hibit closely parallels Mann’s rela-
Yionship with Lexington.

* Mann was born in Lexington to the
gity’s most well-known doctor, :
Robert S. Munger, 34 years ago. At
‘15, she went to a prep school in Ver-
mont where she began her photog-
raphy career with a $50 portrait job
‘of her roommate, the daughter of Ali
Shah Khan and Rita Hayworth.

She went from a Vermont prep
‘school to Vermon’t Bennington Col-
Jlege, a woman’s school that further
stimulated her interest in the arts.

* “T couldn’t have gone to any school
swith rigid policies,” Mann said in an
interview at her home. She said she
‘took as many photography and writ-
ing courses as she could and ignored
the other disciplines.

’ “T am a functional fool in terms of
mot having taken history and chem-
istry,’’ she said.

‘ Besides photography, Mann found
another subject she was interested
in: her future husband Larry Mann,
‘who is now a lawyer and city coun-
scilman in Lexington.

Mann left Bennington after getting
‘married in 1970 and traveled exten-
sively in Europe, studying photog-
raphy and writing intermittently.

* After returning to Lexington,
where Larry set up a blacksmith
shop in their house on McLaughlin
‘Street, Mann received her under-
«graduate and master’s degrees from
Hollins College.

Why did Sally return home to Lex-
<ngton after being a world-traveler?

“T think there’s genuine concern
‘for people here,” she said. Her ex-
hibits in Lexington have drawn a
jarge number of area people, she
‘said, because the local people are in-
terested in what others in the com-
munity are doing.

Many probably wondered what
Mann was doing when she wrapped
trees in her backyard with aluminum

 

 

ment of 1,742. In 1
ment of 1,758.

Next year’s freshman class size of
420 will be 16 more than in 1978.

“In freshman housing, there were
some miscalculations the first year,”’
Wilson admits, though with the new
Gaines Hall taking on first-year law
students, he says Baker dorm will be
opened fully to freshmen.

“Dean John thinks we can house
420 Freshman adequately,” Wilson

an enroli-

‘said.

 

 

And what about Gaines Hall? Is
this part of the big attempt to kill
fraternities?

“IT am not against fraternities,”
Wilson said. “I was a member of a
fraternity in college.”’

“Washington and Lee has had one
of the longest commitments to frater-

foil and put odd sculpture in her front

yard.

She has said that Lexington is a
fairly tolerant community but admits
many people are ‘‘easily shocked.”

“T tako my role as local iconoclast
quite seriously,”’ she said. “I think
it’s good for Lexington.”

“Complacency and contrived gen-
tility really irk me.”

Her work, the essence of Sally
Mann, may be contrived somewhat
but it is certainly not complacent
because photography, she said, must
be active.

“Art should be something that
makes you feel,” she said, and
photography in particular should
seek truth.

“Even if it’s a contrived picture,
I’m still trying for the truth.”

The truth she seeks in her photos
now is a long way from the truth she
recorded as a photographer for the
Washington and Lee news office in
the early 1970s. Maybe the difference
lies in the camera she used then and
the one she uses now.

In an interview with the Roanoke
Times and World-News three years
ago, Mann said working with her 100-
year-old view-finder camera did not
fit her spontaneous character.

Last week, however, she said the
large-format camera does comple-
ment her temperament.

“I’m plodding, methodical,’”’ she
said, characteristics necessary for
working with a camera that does not
have the high shutter speed of a
35mm camera.

For her recent exhibit, Mann said
she often shot the subjects several
times to make sure the girl was com-
fortable with the photo and Mann was
satisfied with the image.

One quality that Mann said makes
a good picture, ‘detention of par-
ticulars,”’ is expressed particularly
well with the big camera because
prints made from the camera’s large
negatives usually are not enlarged.
Smaller negatives are enlarged and
the process tends to make lines and
small objects fuzzy as the print size
increases

A good Sally Mann photo, she said,

“Washington and Lee has had

nities in the land. We depend on
fraternities for social activities, as
well as housing and food,”’ Wilson
said.

“What we need to do here is em-
phasize the fraternity houses
themselves...emphasize friends in
small groups having fun.”’

“We need to get the houses behind
a more varied set of activities, not
just social activities.”

Fixing up the houses, and not hav-
ing parties that damage the property
are ways to do this, he said.

“We cannot afford to have 17
destroyed houses in town...also,
fraternities are starting to realize
their liabilities.”’

“Fraternity life at W&L used to
have a certain elegance...I’m sure
they knew how to party in the 50s, but
the fraternity houses were pleasant
places to live in then.”

“We want to see the fraternities
develop a distinctive social style
again,” said Wilson. ‘Not a six-keg

is “‘the combination of strange and
ing elements which, in a good
picture, for a sense of harmony.”’
Some people who saw the ex-
hibit in the duPont Gallery apparent-
ly thought there were too many
strange and jarring elements in her
photos. Some of the comments in the
exhibit’s registration book said the
work was offensive and ugly.

“T don’t like having to defend my
art,” Mann said. She said many of
the negative comments had come
from Washington and Lee students
and she believes their dislike of the
pictures may stem from not under-
standing the subjects, girls who are
predominantly from poor families.

“(The students) don’t know many

~ women like that.”

Mann said Washington and Lee is
not the only place where her work
has been questioned.

“I think my critics run the gamut,”
she said.

Sally Mann does not have thin skin,
however. She said that bad com-
ments, though not ego boosters, are
more comforting than blank com-
‘ment hooks...

“A jblank space makes me
wonder,”’ she said. “I think they’re
good pictures so I’m not worried.”

And worried she should not be
because her work has found a niche
in the inner circle of the art world.

The Polaroid Co. gave her thous-
ands of dollars worth of film and a
large-format Polaroid camera to
photograph different items she tosses
in a small wading pool she keeps in
her backyard.

The images of suspended, decom-
posed and odd objects are colorful
and mysterious.

She was one of a few photographers
in the country chosen for this project
and has traveled across' the country

Mann has also found a niche,
perhaps smaller than the one she oc-
cupies in photography, in the literary
circle. She said a book of her poems
will be published later this year.

‘Schroeder on women

SON PEN

News Editor

" Surprise! Women didn’t come to
‘America on cruise ships. And they
didn’t ask where they could get their
nails done as soon as they set foot on
‘dry land.

A woman, however, was responsi-
ble for the printing of the Declaration
of In . And a woman was
the only Revolutionary War soldier
buried at West Point. And Martha
‘Washington, wife of George, was
compensated by Congress for war-
time service. George said her
presence at Valley Forge inspired
the soldiers.

But many women don’t know about
‘what women have done in history, ac-
‘cording to Congresswoman Patricia
Schroeder (D-Colo), and neither do
men.

* Schroeder said that while many
wwomen are struggling to juggle
careers and families, they don’t
Tealize that it has been done before.
Martha Washington, for example,
yan Mount Vernon from planting to
harvest each year and then went to
join her husband.

, Women still think they are lesser
beings is they are not able to manage
oth a career and a family, said
Schroeder. And according to Labor
Department statistics, 9-out-of-10
women will have to work at some
point in their lives. Very few women,
she said, have the option of choosing
between a career and raising a fami-

an endowed lecture series in honor of
one of the first suffragettes.

The whole point of the series, said
Schroeder, is to show what women
have done, They are not asking to
walk behind men, nor in front of
them, but rather walk by their sides,
she said. ‘They are not asking for
more, they are asking for equal.”

Schroeder was first elected to Con-
gress in 1972. She is the dean of the
Colorado delegation, the most senior
woman in Congress and is the Demo-
cratic whip. She said she knows first-
hand what it is like to try and balance
acareer and a family. However, ‘‘We
are not superwomen,”’ she said.

In talking about the American
family, Schroeder, the founder of the
Congressional Caucus on Women’s
Issues, said that there is no option,
we must do something about the

American family. One of the first
places to start, she said, is to stop
thinking of it as male versus female,
and start thinking of it as family.

The divorce rate in the United
States is one of the highest in the
western world, and the lowest paid
workers are day-care workers and
teachers.

“What are we saying about our
young people?”’ she asked.

Schroeder is co-sponsor of a bill
that would allow general wage
earners six moths leave without pay
if taken sick and four months leave
without pay if they have or adopt a
child. These are compromises, but
Schroeder admitted they were better
than nothing.

The United States is not the first
country to adopt a. policy like this,
said Schroeder. It is the last.

party were the local high-school kids
wander in.”

“We need to get a generation in
here that doesn’t remember being
legal to drink.”

Wilson thinks all the fraternity
houses can survive.

When the guidelines for co-ed
enrollment were set in 1984, he said,
1,000 men were thought to be enough
to keep the fraternity system going.

In 1984, the last year before co-ed,
824 men out of 1,300 were frat
members, or about 60 percent.

If fraternities could be made more
appealing, it was reasoned, more
men would join. If 80 percent of 1,000
men pledged, the frats would still
have their 800 men.

Over 80 percent of this year’s
freshman class did pledge this year,
but the members were not spread out
evenly between the houses.

The future, Wilson said, will show
whether each house can get its share
of the 80 percent.

Sampson is to appeal

 

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Assignments Editor

Phillip L. Sampson Jr., the
freshman who was suspended by the
Student Conduct Committee last
week for shooting a 15-year-old girl
with a blowdart, said Tuesday he
would appeal the decision.

Sampson’s appeal was scheduled
to be considered today by the Student
Affairs Committee, according to
Dean of Students Lewis G. John,
chairman of the 10-member SAC.
That committee has the options of
upholding the SCC’s decision or
reducing the penalty, John said. It
cannot vote for a harsher penalty.

On Jan. 29, Sampson was placed on
social probation and conduct proba-
tion by the 13-student SCC. The SAC

gro in enrollment, Wilson
thinks, does not effect W&L’s status
as a teaching institution.

“Our faculty-student ratio is
higher now than it was four years
ago...teaching is still the primary
obligation of the faculty.”

More money is being allocated to
encourage professors to do research
over the summer, but these ‘‘profes-
sional activities’ will not interfere
with teaching he said.

“This is a teaching institution from
September to June...(though) it is
important that faculty stay in touch
with their peers; we are small and
isolated.”

“Faculty members still teach
three courses each, so they can ask
for writing and have personal rela-
tionships with students,”’ he said.

According to Wilson, class sizes
have not increased substantially.

“We looked at class size...the
number of classes with under 30
students has stayed the same. There
are 11 classes with over 40 students.”’

These larger classes, he said, are
mostly with the more popular pro-
fessors, particularly in the history
department, which had three mem-
bers on leave last term.

Overall, he said, W&L can main-
tain its small class sizes.

The president hears all the
criticism leveled at ‘‘the administra-
tion” but, to his way of thinking, this
is just part of the transition.

“‘T have to try desperately to keep
perspective, and that’s dreadfully
hard to do...I have to keep telling
myself to slow down, don’t overad-
ministrate.”’

“‘We reconsidered the case and felt
a mistake had been made in a few dif-
ferent areas, and therefore changed
our decision,’’ SCC Chairman
Michael R. McAllister said in an in-
terview this week. ‘‘The Student Con-
duct Committee is content with the
decision.”

John said that the SAC agreed with
the SCC’s finding that Sampson was
guilty of a major offense under
university rules because he inflicted
bodily injury. The only two penalties
that may be given for such an offense
are suspension and expulsion, unless
the case involves ‘‘unusual extenua-
tion.”

John said the SAC could not find
any extenuating circumstances. It
did not ask for a specific penalty,
John said, only that the initial penal-
ty be reconsidered.

The girl, a local high school stu-
dent, is the daughter of W&L
Associate Dean of Students Leroy C.
“Buddy” Atkins. She was hit in the
shoulder but was not injured serious-
ly.

In a separate incident, Bernard

Sampson’s case back to the SCC,
John said.

Sampson told the Phi three weeks
ago that he did not shoot Atkins’
daughter on purpose, that he had not
meant to hit anyone with the dart and
that he didn’t find out that the girl
had been hit until the next day.

The incident occurred after the
W&L-Roanoke basketball game on
Jan. 15. Sampson said he shot the
dart from a second-floor window of
the Graham-Lees dorm toward some
Roanoke fans who were making
degrading comments to incite the
W&L students. He estimated that the
Roanokers were between 50 and 75
yards away.

Sampson said he knew he could not
shoot the dart that far but thought
that it might intimidate them.

University Proctor Charles F.
“Murph” Murray said the dart was
at least four inches long, It hit the girl
in the back of the shoulder, Atkins
said, penetrating about a half-inch in-
to her skin.

Kreps calls for involvement

 

By JEFF HARWOOD
Staff Reporter

Juanita Kreps, the first woman and
the first economist to serve as United
States Secretary of Commerce, call-
ed on the United States to become
more involved in international trade
Tuesday night.

Speaking in Lee Chapel, Kreps said
that “economists always give a
gloomy message’”’ and that “we all
share a common interest: our
careers.

“Careers are linked, directly or in-
directly, with business affairs and
performance of economy,” she said.

Kreps, commerce secretary for
President Jimmy Carter from
1977-1979, said the imbalance of inter-
national trade has caused the United
States to “feel a greater economic
vulnerability.” Future economic
development in the United States
must involve the international
market.

And she warned that American in-
dustries are expected to face more
difficulties in the future. Citing
various facts and statistics, Kreps

described “Japan as the greatest
saver and the United States as the
greatest borrower.”

The mixture of ‘Anglo-Saxon
hedonism and Oriental thrift’? has
caused economic conflict which, con-
trary to some American theories, is
not caused solely by the high value of
the U.S. dollar, according to Kreps.
In response to the United States’ re-
quest that other countries stimulate
their economies, nations such as Ger-
many have said it is the responsibili-
ty of the United States.

“Should the United States en-
courage the thrifty Japaneses and
other investors around the world to
acquire U.S. debts and private pro-
perty,”’ Kreps asked, ‘‘or should we
involve domestic policies that would
discourage conumption and en-
courage greater savings?”’

If it is the latter, she said, ‘“The ’86
tax reform moved us in the wrong
direction.”

Many U.S. companies are moving
to Japan and other countries in the
Pacific where they will have room to
develop more efficiently, Kreps said.
The U.S. ‘‘adjustment has not been
smooth, nor complete.

“We must invest in human re-
sources,’’ she said.

She suggested that instead of pro-
tecting our industries that sell higher
priced goods, the American public
should be willing to raise the educa-
tion and skill level of the workers
whose jobs are jeopardized by
foreign industries.

In an attempt to lessen interna-
tional trade conflicts, the United
States and Japan have established
economic pledges. Kreps said the
United States requested a ‘‘reduction
in Japan’s discount rate and a
budgetary proposal designed to
stimulate the Japanese economy. In
return, the United States pledged its
opposition to protectionist measures
and promised significant and steady
reductions in the federal deficit.”

When confronted about the
economic policies of the Carter ad-
ministration, Kreps instead noted the
deficit increase and the current inter-
national trade imbalance of the
Reagan administration.

“You have to balance them,’’ she
said, ‘““You make your decision, I'll
make mine.”

Point cards cause jump in sales

By GEORGE G. SPARACIO
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee Snack
Bar has been experiencing over-
crowding this year due to the use of
point cards, which have been at-
tributed to an increase in sales of
over 50 percent.

Overcrowding at the snack bar has
been of concern to the Food Service
and to some students. To deal with
this, the snack bar opens two
registers at crowded times.

Junior Karl Brewer said, ‘‘It really
doesn’t bother me that much. You
know it’s going to be crowded five
minutes before class. If that bothers
you go at a different time.”’ Soph-
omore Gregory Castonuovo explain-
ed, “It’s hard to get a quick bite or
drink between classes.”

About five years ago, Gerald J.
Darrell, Director of University Food
Services, introduced the point card to

Washington and Lee as a conven-
ience to the students. Prior to this,
the only alternative was the 20-meal
plan.

Last year, Darrell introduced the
use of the point card in GHQ. In addi-
tion, students on the 20-meal plan
were permitted to eat in the GHQ as
an alternative. However, there was
not enough room to accommodate the
20-meal plan, so it was discontinued
in the GHQ.

Students came to Darrell last year
requesting that he devise a plan
allowing students to use their point
cards at the snack bar. Darrell said
that the purpose of the Food Service
is “to provide a service to the
students.” He went on to say that the
use of the point card at the snack bar
benefits all students.

Sales at the snack bar have dou-
bled this year. Richard L. Arm-
strong, Snack Bar Manager, said,
“The point card created a very

substantial increase in business.”
Armstrong said that last year, the
snack bar had only two days in which
sales went over $1,000. This year,
they are averaging over $1,400 a day,
and only twice have they dipped
below the $1,000 mark. Junior John
Packett said, ‘‘I think it’s great for a
bite to eat and a place to hang.”

In addition, Armstrong explained
that the point card produces substan-
tial savings. There is no tax on items
purchased with the card, giving the
student a seven percent discount.
Also there are specials in both the
GHQ and the snack bar providing
students with an additional 15 to 20
percent discount. Darrell also said
that over 80 percent of the students
charge their point card home.

In the future, there are plans for a
Bookstore/Snack Bar renovation.
Darrell said, ‘‘It’s going to be a big
project and we're really excited
about it.”’

WLUR celebrates its

By BECKY REYNOLDS
Staff Reporter

There is a celebration going on in
Reid Hall this year. 1987 is the twen-
tieth year anniversary of WLUR, the
Washington and Lee campus radio
station. Found at 91.5 on the FM
radio dial, WLUR has grown and
developed throughout its twenty year
existence.

On November 1, 1966, the Federal
Communications Commission grant-
ed Washington and Lee a construc-
tion permit for a new Class D, non-
commercial, educational FM broad-
casting station of ten watts power.
This permit opened the door to begin
WLUR. An area on the third floor of
Reid Hall was designated as the site
of the new radio station and a thirty
foot antenna was assembled on the
roof. The broadcasting studio was
equipped with a type FM-22 transmit-
ter. WDBJ, Roanoke, Virginia do-
nated a Western Electric control

board, three turntables, five tape’

recorders and various other equip-
ment to the WLUR project.~ An’
automatic cartridge tape playback, a
variety of tape cartridges, micro-
phones, an AM/FM tuner and four
thousand LP recordings were also
obtained for the station. And, along
with the broadcasting station, tape
and record libraries and a news room
complete with Associated Press
wires were set up in Reid Hall for use
by radio personnel.

When WLUR began, the station
manager was Charles E. Winston
and the Chief Engineer was J. Ed
Newman. On Tuesday, January 3ist,
Newman ran a series of equipment
tests with the new WLUR facilities.
The station operated smoothly within
plus or minus twenty thousand cycles
to its assigned frequency of 91.5

megacycles.

After taking a survey of the cam-

pus and Lexington, the officers of

WLUR discovered that the most
wanted program was a classical

. Music show followed by Broadway

and movie scores and news pro-
grams respectively. With this infor-
mation in mind, WLUR-FM began its
regular schedule of broadcasts on
February 25, 1967. The. station’s

' hours of operation were 7:00 to 11:00

p.m., Monday through Friday.

Fred C, Cole, President of Wash-
ington and Lee University when
WLUR began, said of the station:
“This [WLUR] is a service to the

whole community, to increase the

 

Robert deMaria

understanding and enjoyment of all
within the station’s range.”

John K. Jennings, '56, professor of
Journalism today, returned to
Washington and Lee after graduate
school a year after WLUR started
operating. He remembers the station
as much smaller with less broad-
casting time but still well supported
by the University and community.

In 1977, Robert deMaria was hired
to work on WLUR and is still the
General Manager and Journalism
Department representative . of
WLUR. When he arrived at W&L,
deMaria found the station somewhat
chaotic. In previous years, there had
been numerous General Managers
who were not consistent. However,
deMaria has been a member of the
WLUR community for nine years,
and he is in charge of the biggest
staff ever to work on the radio sta-
tion.

Since deMaria’s arrival at WLUR,
the station has acquired almost all
new equipment including a compact
disk player two years ago. Although
the station is in need of a new
transmitter, a twenty-five thousand
dollar project, deMaria feel that
WLUR has ‘“‘state of the art equip-
ment.” The station has grown and
prospered. For. example, in 1977,
WLUR had three hundred jazz
albums; now there are over four
thousand LP’s in the jazz collection.

DeMaria finds John D. Wilson,
president of W&L, very supportive of
WLUR, especially the classics
shows. Also, deMaria said “the

Ssivirw.

students are. very loyal and vocal.

why I love being in there."

This makes the station better.”’

The most popular music programs
on WLUR include Classical Show-
case, Third Ear, Afternoon Rock,
Oldies and Skyline Jazz. The music
that is played on WLUR is closely
monitored and carefully screened.
The staff of WLUR is in contact with
record companies that deMaria
thinks ‘‘will be supportive as long as
we play their music, keep in touch
and let them know what we are do-
ing.’’ WLUR follows a playlist from
“College Media Journal” and at least
half of all shows contain new music.

Another growing part of WLUR is
its new department. Although most
news is obtained from the Associated
Press, this is the first year that on-
the-spot radio reporting has been
successful. Monday through Friday,
a different story is reported on by a
Washington and Lee student. This
project works in correlation with the
Journalism Department and the
reporters earn one credit each.

DeMaria is pleased with the pro-
gress and success WLUR has achiey-
ed over its twenty year existence. He
notes that ‘‘before I came here, there
was a management turnover every
three or four years. I’ve been here

‘nine. I love my job and I love the

radio and T.V. stations a lot.”
Sharing deMaria’s enthusiastic at-
titude for WLUR, freshman Tanya
Pergola, classics and jazz disk
jockey, said, ‘‘being in the studio is
like being in an oasis: an escape from
the mayhem of the campus. That's

He improved the schedule, which
consisted of blocks of jazz, classics,

programming at specific times dur-

“Tt still serves mainly as an educa-

WP isch has shown that people in
offices tend to listen to classics dur-
ing the mid-morning hours and jazz
in the early afternoon, de Maria said.
Students are in class at those times
and tend to listen to the radio less.

Late afternoon is an excellent time
for rock because it attracts both col-
lege and high school students, be
said. The station is run by W&L, but
it is licensed to serve Lexington and
Rockbridge County. So the program-
ming must serve more than just the
W&L students.

The evening music schedule begins
with classics, followed by _pro-

This is not a story about USA To-
day, the fast-food of the nation’s
newspapers, but it is a story about
McNews.

More precisely, it’s the story of a
McMahon from Milwaukee known as
““McNews”’ — Timothy G. McNews.

A record buff since the time he
wore diapers, McMahon tried to get
on the Gong Show at the age of 10 by
impersonating a dead president. As a
teenager at Marquette University
High School, his dad’s alma mater,
he was very involved in acting and
forensics, not to mention a million-
and-one other activities.

Now, at 21, Mr. McNews is making
McWaves on the third floor of Reid
Hall as news director of WLUR-FM.
A German/journalism double major,
he’s worked with WLUR faculty ad-
viser Robert J. de Maria to create
what de Maria thinks is the best news
department the radio station has
ever had.

As always, the news staff broad-
casts daily, 30-minute newscasts at
noon, and news updates at 3 p.m. But
for the first time, those newscasts in-
clude actual reports filed by WLUR
staff reporters.

Having daily news reporters was
an idea that McMahon discussed with
de Maria last year, Each reporter
receives a graded independent study .
credit for his or her work.

McMahon’s job is to prepare daily

they often develop their own story
ideas, which is a major accomplish-
ment for a quintet of sophomores.
And not only are they reporting the
news, McMahon said, but they’ re ex-
cited about it. my

Much of the credit must go to Mr.
McNews, whose trademark is his not-
quite- -so-innocent, face-filling
McSmile.

know what they’re doing right and 4

wrong. But he’s always friendly
about it. And even when he’s serious
or upset, McMahon still flashes that
chummy Newmanesque (as in Alfred
E., not Paul) grin.

“Look at the guy and have him
smile at you, and you try to tell him,

the big brother to a lot of these kids.”’

McNews is limited because he has
only one reporter available each day.
“‘We can’t cover all the important or
relative meetings,” he said.

Although the station’s primary
responsibility is to W&L, McMahon
wants to be more involved in the
community. So his reporters also
cover - local’ government, school
boards and similar groups. He thinks
it’s important to report news not
directly related to W&L.

The two most important stories he
thinks the station’s covered this year
have been the John Read trial and
the resignation of Lexington Police
Chief L.O. Sutton.

A dorm counselor and recent ODK
inductee, McMahon -has done so
much that he had to leave ac-
complishments off his resume that
most students would have considered -
prime fodder. But he still would like
‘to complete two more big projects
before graduation.

One is a weekly, half-hour radio
news show.. “I. don’t -think | it’s
unrealistic on a trial basis right
now,’’ said McMahon, who envisions
a show focusing .on specific issues
‘and presenting an overview of the.
week’s events, He’d like to replay
each of the daily reports and con-
tribute some editorialinsights.. ~~.

McMahon was interested in broad- °

Fool around he did; At the age of 10,
he’d heard Vaughn Meader’s imper-
sonation of John F. Kennedy on ‘‘The
First Family’’ record album enough
times to do a pretty good impersona-
tion of Meader : rere the
president. ,

During the summer between: the
fifth and sixth grades, McMahon ar
his older brother, Pat, went :
California to visit relatives. The twa
had worked up a routine, with Pat ay
the interviewer andTim as JFK. |

The clincher was that tiny, smiling!
Tim sat in a high-backed chair. Thé
Gong Show audience would nevefi
have known he was a little kid unti
the very end of the act. His uncle
thought it was hysterical. ;

So Pat and Tim called the Gong
Show. Tim did his voice, pleading
with them to let him on. “They said
they would not accept acts that would
be demeaning to dead presidents, of
something like that,’’ he said. :

Undaunted, McMahon still playg
with his voice — impersonating Peg
Wee Herman, Billy Crystal and Mf
T. on his Monday Morning Magaziné
show. And McMultimediaman thé i
he is, he’s also managed to dabble is}
TV and print journalism, too. 4

He decided to stick with radio dury
ing his junior year. Although prinl
and television were definite options}
he’s glad he chose the post at WLUR

“I get to work with de Maria, who's}
an excellent teacher. He’s taught méj
an awful lot, and not just about jo’ u
n-"sm,’’ McMahon said. BS

He’s had the satisfaction of hearing!
other stations broadcast his news
reports. By recruiting plenty off
young broadcasters, he’s provided
for what should be a smooth transi‘)
tion next year. And his charm and wit}

_ have helped him develop personal

relationships with his staffers. a
Most of all, he’s met the magical
challenge of trying to paint pictures

Surveys have shown classics to be

In the past few years, the station’s

move applauded by de Maria. Pro-

420 will be 16 more than in 1978.

“In freshman housing, there were
some miscalculations the first year,”
Wilson admits, though with the new
Gaines Hall taking on first-year law
students, he says Baker dorm will be
opened fully to freshmen.

“Dean John thinks we can house
420 Freshman adequately,’’ Wilson
said.

hibit closely parallels Mann’s rela-
‘tionship with Lexington.

* Mann was born in Lexington to the
city’s most well-known doctor,
Robert S. Munger, 34 years ago. At
‘15, she went to a prep school in Ver-
mont where she began her photog-
raphy career with a $50 portrait job
‘of her roommate, the daughter of Ali
Shah Khan and Rita Hayworth.

She went from a Vermont prep
‘school to Vermon’t Bennington Col-
lege, a woman’s school that further
stimulated her interest in the arts.

* “T couldn’t have gone to any school
with rigid policies,’ Mann said in an
interview at her home. She said she
‘took as many photography and writ-
ing courses as she could and ignored
the other disciplines.

* “T am a functional fool in terms of
not having taken history and chem-
istry,” she said.

‘ Besides photography, Mann f
vanother subject she was interested
in: her future husband Larry Mann,
‘who is now a lawyer and city coun-
scilman in Lexington.

Mann left Bennington after getting
‘married in 1970 and traveled exten-
sively in Europe, studying photog-
raphy and writing intermittently.

* After returning to Lexington,
where Larry set up a blacksmith
shop in their house on McLaughlin
‘Street, Mann received her under-
«graduate and master’s degrees from
Hollins College.

* Why did Sally return home to Lex-
sington after being a world-traveler?

“T think there’s genuine concern
‘for people here,” she said. Her ex-
hibits in Lexington have drawn a
large number of area people, she
‘said, because the local people are in-
terested in what others in the com-
munity are doing.

” Many probably wondered what
Mann was doing when she wrapped
trees in her backyard with aluminum

 

And what about Gaines Hall? Is
this part of the big attempt to kill
fraternities?

“IT am not against fraternities,”
Wilson said. ‘‘I was a member of a
fraternity in college.”’

“Washington and Lee has had one
of the longest commitments to frater-

foil and put odd sculpture in her front
yard.

She has said that Lexington is a
fairly tolerant community but admits
many people are ‘‘easily shocked.”

“I tako my role as local iconoclast
quite seriously,’’ she said. ‘‘I think
it’s good for Lexington.”

“Complacency and contrived gen-
tility really irk me.”

Her work, the essence of Sally
Mann, may be contrived somewhat
but it is certainly not complacent
because photography, she said, must
be active.

“Art should be something that
makes you feel,” she said, and
photography in particular should
seek truth.

“Even if it’s a contrived picture,
I’mstill trying for the truth.”’

The truth she seeks in her photos
now is a long way from the truth she
recorded as a photographer for the
Washington and Lee news office in
the early 1970s. Maybe the difference
lies in the camera she used then and
the one she uses now.

In an interview with the Roanoke
Times and World-News three years
ago, Mann said working with her 100-
year-old view-finder camera did not
fit her spontaneous character.

Last week, however, she said the
large-format camera does comple-
ment her temperament.

“I’m plodding, methodical,’’ she
said, characteristics necessary for
working with a camera that does not
have the high shutter speed of a
35mm camera.

For her recent exhibit, Mann said
she often shot the subjects several
times to make sure the girl was com-
fortable with the photo and Mann was
satisfied with the image.

One quality that Mann said makes
a good picture, ‘‘detention of par-
ticulars,”’ is expressed particularly
well with the big camera because
prints made from the camera’s large
negatives usually are not enlarged.
Smaller negatives are enlarged and
the process tends to make lines and
small objects fuzzy as the print size
increases.

A good Sally Mann photo, she said,

“Washington and Lee has_ had

one of the longest commitments

to fraternities in the land.’

nities in the land. We depend on
fraternities for social activities, as
well as housing and food,’’ Wilson
said.

“What we need to do here is em-
phasize the fraternity houses
themselves...emphasize friends in
small groups having fun.”

“We need to get the houses behind
a more varied set of activities, not
just social activities.’

Fixing up the houses, and not hav-
ing parties that damage the property
are ways to do this, he said.

“We cannot afford to have 17
destroyed houses in town...also,
fraternities are starting to realize
their liabilities.”’

“Fraternity life at W&L used to
have a certain elegance...I’m sure
they knew how to party in the 50s, but
the fraternity houses were pleasant
places to live in then.”’

“We want to see the fraternities
develop a distinctive social style
again,” said Wilson. ‘‘Not a six-keg

is ‘the combination of strange and
jarring elements which, in a good
picture, for a sense of harmony.”

Some people who saw the ex-
hibit in the duPont Gallery apparent-
ly thought there were too many
strange and jarring elements in her
photos. Some of the comments in the
exhibit’s registration book said the
work was offensive and ugly.

“1 don’t like having to defend my
art,” Mann said. She said many of
the negative comments had come
from Washington and Lee students
and she believes their dislike of the
pictures may stem from not under-
standing the subjects, girls who are
predominantly from poor families.

“(The students) don’t know many
women like that.”’

Mann said Washington and Lee is
not the only place where her work
has been questioned.

“T think my critics run the gamut,”
she said.

Sally Mann does not have thin skin,
however. She said that bad com-
ments, though not ego boosters, are
more comforting than blank com-
ment hooks.

“A jblank space makes me
wonder,” she said. ‘I think they’re
good pictures so I’m not worried.”’

And worried she should not be
because her work has found a niche
in the inner circle of the art world.

The Polaroid Co. gave her thous-
ands of dollars worth of film and a
large-format Polaroid camera to
photograph different items she tosses
in a small wading pool she keeps in
her backyard.

The images of suspended, decom-
posed and odd objects are colorful
and mysterious.

She was one of a few photographers
in the country chosen for this project
and has traveled across the country
with the other artists promoting the
series.

Mann has also found a niche,
perhaps smaller than the one she oc-
cupies in photography, in the literary
circle. She said a book of her poems
will be published later this year.

Schroeder on women

‘
ByJOHNPENSEC

News Editor

 

" Surprise! Women didn’t come to
‘America on cruise ships. And they
didn’t ask where they could get their
nails done as soon as they set foot on
‘dry land.

, A woman, however, was responsi-
ble for the printing of the Declaration
‘of Independence. And a woman was
the only Revolutionary War soldier
buried at West Point. And Martha
‘Washington, wife of George, was
compensated by Congress for war-
time service. George said her
presence at Valley Forge inspired
the soldiers.

But many women don’t know about
‘what women have done in history, ac-
‘cording to Congresswoman Patricia
Schroeder (D-Colo), and neither do
men.

* Schroeder said that while many
women are struggling to juggle
careers and families, they don’t
realize that it has been done before.
Martha Washington, for example,
ran Mount Vernon from planting to
harvest each year and then went to
join her husband.

. Women still think they are lesser
beings is they are not able to manage
both a career and a family, said
Schroeder. And according to Labor
Department statistics, 9-out-of-10
women will have to work at some
point in their lives. Very few women,
she said, have the option of choosing
between a career and raising a fami-
ly.
Schroeder spoke Monday in Nor-
then Auditorium as the maiden
speaker in the Otey Lecture Series,

a

 

an endowed lecture series in honor of
one of the first suffragettes.

The whole point of the series, said
Schroeder, is to show what women
have done. They are not asking to
walk behind men, nor in front of
them, but rather walk by their sides,
she said. ‘“They are not asking for
more, they are asking for equal.”’

Schroeder was first elected to Con-
gress in 1972. She is the dean of the
Colorado delegation, the most senior
woman in Congress and is the Demo-
cratic whip. She said she knows first-
hand what it is like to try and balance
a career and a family. However, ‘‘We
are not superwomen,”’ she said.

In talking about the American
family, Schroeder, the founder of the
Congressional Caucus on Women’s
Issues, said that there is no option,
we must do something about the

American family. One of the first
places to start, she said, is to stop
thinking of it as male versus female,
and start thinking of it as family.

The divorce rate in the United
States is one of the highest in the
western world, and the lowest paid
workers are day-care workers and
teachers.

“What are we saying about our
young people?”’ she asked.

Schroeder is co-sponsor of a bill
that would allow general wage
earners six moths leave without pay
if taken sick and four months leave
without pay if they have or adopt a
child. These are compromises, but
Schroeder admitted they were better
than nothing.

The United States is not the first
country to adopt a policy like this,
said Schroeder. It is the last.

 

party were the local high-school kids
wander in.”

“We need to get a generation in
here that doesn’t remember being
legal to drink.”

Wilson thinks all the fraternity
houses can survive.

When the guidelines for co-ed
enrollment were set in 1984, he said,
1,000 men were thought to be enough
to keep the fraternity system going.

In 1984, the last year before co-ed,
824 men out of 1,300 were frat
members, or about 60 percent.

If fraternities could be made more
appealing, it was reasoned, more
men would join. If 80 percent of 1,000
men pledged, the frats would still
have their 800 men.

Over 80 percent of this year’s
freshman class did pledge this year,
but the members were not spread out
evenly between the houses.

The future, Wilson said, will show
whether each house can get its share
of the 80 percent.

Sampson is to appeal

 

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Assignments Editor

Phillip L. Sampson Jr., the
freshman who was suspended by the
Student Conduct Committee last
week for shooting a 15-year-old girl
with a blowdart, said Tuesday he
would appeal the decision.

Sampson’s appeal was scheduled
to be considered today by the Student
Affairs Committee, according to
Dean of Students Lewis G. John,
chairman of the 10-member SAC.
That committee has the options of
upholding the SCC’s decision or
reducing the penalty, John said. It
cannot vote for a harsher penalty.

On Jan. 29, Sampson was placed on
social probation and conduct proba-
tion by the 13-student SCC. The SAC
reviewed the case and asked the SCC
to reconsider its findings.

The SCC then voted to suspend
Sampson, a freshman from Houston,
for shooting the girl in the shoulder
with the dart.

e growth in enrollment, Wilson
thinks, does not effect W&L’s status
as a teaching institution.

“Our faculty-student ratio is
higher now than it was four years
ago...teaching is still the primary
obligation of the faculty.”

More money is being allocated to
encourage professors to do research
over the summer, but these ‘‘profes-
sional activities’ will not interfere
with teaching he said.

“This is a teaching institution from
September to June...(though) it is
important that faculty stay in touch
with their peers; we are small and
isolated.”

“Faculty members still teach
three courses each, so they can ask
for writing and have personal rela-
tionships with students,’’ he said.

According to Wilson, class sizes
have not increased substantially.

“We looked at class size...the
number of classes with under 30
students has stayed the same. There
are 11 classes with over 40 students.”’

These larger classes, he said, are
mostly with the more popular pro-
fessors, particularly in the history
department, which had three mem-
bers on leave last term.

Overall, he said, W&L can main-
tain its small class sizes.

The president hears all the
criticism leveled at ‘‘the administra-
tion’’ but, to his way of thinking, this
is just part of the transition.

“T have to try desperately to keep
perspective, and that’s dreadfully
hard to do...I have to keep telling
myself to slow down, don’t overad-
ministrate.”’

“We reconsidered the case and felt
a mistake had been made in a few dif-
ferent areas, and therefore changed
our decision,’ SCC Chairman
Michael R. McAllister said in an in-
terview this week. ‘‘The Student Con-
duct Committee is content with the
decision.”

John said that the SAC agreed with
the SCC’s finding that Sampson was
guilty of a major offense under
university rules because he inflicted
bodily injury. The only two penalties
that may be given for such an offense
are suspension and expulsion, unless
the case involves “unusual extenua-
tion.”

John said the SAC could not find
any extenuating circumstances. It
did not ask for a specific penalty,
John said, only that the initial penal-
ty be reconsidered.

The girl, a local high school stu-
dent, is the daughter of W&L
Associate Dean of Students Leroy C.
“Buddy” Atkins. She was hit in the
shoulder but was not injured serious-
ly.

know if it’s the same person or not,”’
said Murray.

In a separate incident, Bernard
Merchant III, 25, has been charged
with statutory burglary, petit
larceny and grand larceny in connec-
tion with thefts last week from
Gilliam Dorm.

Thefts in the dorms and campus
buildings have been on the rise, said
Murray. “I think if students would
just lock their doors,’’ it would deter
many thefts, said Security Officer
Burr Datz.

With that class, the undergraduate
enrollment will reach 1,500, and in-
crease of more than 160 students over
1983 enrollment figures. The Board of
Trustees voted to increase under-
graduate enrollment in 1984.

rooms in Gaines Hall have been re-
served, and that the construction is

stained when that body voted to send
Sampson’s case back to the SCC,
John said.

Sampson told the Phi three weeks
ago that he did not shoot Atkins’
daughter on purpose, that he had not
meant to hit anyone with the dart and
that he didn’t find out that the girl
had been hit until the next day.

The incident occurred after the
W&L-Roanoke basketball game on
Jan. 15. Sampson said he shot the
dart from a second-floor window of
the Graham-Lees dorm toward some
Roanoke fans who were making
degrading comments to incite the
W&L students. He estimated that the
Roanokers were between 50 and 75
yards away.

Sampson said he knew he could not
shoot the dart that far but thought
that it might intimidate them.

University Proctor Charles F.
‘“Murph” Murray said the dart was
at least four inches long. It hit the girl
in the back of the shoulder, Atkins
said, penetrating about a half-inch in-
to her skin.

Kreps calls for involvement

 

By JEFF HARWOOD
Staff Reporter

 

Juanita Kreps, the first woman and
the first economist to serve as United
States Secretary of Commerce, call-
ed on the United States to become
more involved in international trade
Tuesday night.

Speaking in Lee Chapel, Kreps said
that “economists always give a
gloomy message” and that ‘we all
share a common interest: our
careers.

“Careers are linked, directly or in-
directly, with business affairs and
performance of economy,” she said.

Kreps, commerce secretary for
President Jimmy Carter from
1977-1979, said the imbalance of inter-
national trade has caused the United
States to ‘feel a greater economic
vulnerability.” Future economic
development in the United States
must involve the international
market.

And she warned that American in-
dustries are expected to face more
difficulties in the future. Citing
various facts and statistics, Kreps

described “Japan as the greatest
saver and the United States as the
greatest borrower.”’

The mixture of ‘Anglo-Saxon
hedonism and Oriental thrift’ has
caused economic conflict which, con-
trary to some American theories, is
not caused solely by the high value of
the U.S. dollar, according to Kreps.
In response to the United States’ re-
quest that other countries stimulate
their economies, nations such as Ger-
many have said it is the responsibili-
ty of the United States.

“Should the United States en-
courage the thrifty Japaneses and
other investors around the world to
acquire U.S. debts and private pro-
perty,’’ Kreps asked, ‘‘or should we
involve domestic policies that would
discourage conumption and _ en-
courage greater savings?”’

If it is the latter, she said, ‘‘The ’86
tax reform moved us in the wrong
direction.”

Many U.S. companies are moving
to Japan and other countries in the
Pacific where they will have room to
develop more efficiently, Kreps said.
The U.S. “adjustment has not been
smooth, nor complete.

“We must invest in human re-
sources,”’ she said.

She suggested that instead of pro-
tecting our industries that sell higher
priced goods, the American public
should be willing to raise the educa-
tion and skill level of the workers
whose jobs are jeopardized by
foreign industries.

In an attempt to lessen interna-
tional trade conflicts, the United
States and Japan have established
economic pledges. Kreps said the
United States requested a ‘‘reduction
in Japan’s discount rate and a
budgetary proposal designed to
stimulate the Japanese economy. In
return, the United States pledged its
opposition to protectionist measures
and promised significant and steady
reductions in the federal deficit.’’

When confronted about the
economic policies of the Carter ad-
ministration, Kreps instead noted the
deficit increase and the current inter-
national trade imbalance of the
Reagan administration.

“You have to balance them,”’ she
said. ‘‘You make your decision, I'l!
make mine.”

Point cards cause jump in sales

By GEORGE G. SPARACIO
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee Snack
Bar has been experiencing over-
crowding this year due to the use of
point cards, which have been at-
tributed to an increase in sales of
over 50 percent.

Overcrowding at the snack bar has
been of concern to the Food Service
and to some students. To deal with
this, the snack bar opens two
registers at crowded times.

Junior Karl Brewer said, ‘‘It really
doesn’t bother me that much. You
know it’s going to be crowded five
minutes before class. If that bothers
you go at a different time.’’ Soph-
omore Gregory Castonuovo explain-
ed, ‘It’s hard to get a quick bite or
drink between classes.”’

About five years ago, Gerald J.
Darrell, Director of University Food
Services, introduced the point card to

Washington and Lee as a conven-
ience to the students. Prior to this,
the only alternative was the 20-meal
plan.

Last year, Darrell introduced the
use of the point card in GHQ. In addi-
tion, students on the 20-meal plan
were permitted to eat in the GHQ as
an alternative. However, there was
not enough room to accommodate the
20-meal plan, so it was discontinued
in the GHQ.

Students came to Darrell last year
requesting that he devise a plan
allowing students to use their point
cards at the snack bar. Darrell said
that the purpose of the Food Service
is “to provide a service to the
students.’’ He went on to say that the
use of the point card at the snack bar
benefits all students.

Sales at the snack bar have dou-
bled this year. Richard L. Arm-
strong, Snack Bar Manager, said,
“The point card created a very

substantial increase in business.”’
Armstrong said that last year, the
snack bar had only two days in which
sales went over $1,000. This year,
they are averaging over $1,400 a day,
and only twice have they dipped
below the $1,000 mark, Junior John
Packett said, ‘I think it’s great for a
bite to eat and a place to hang.”’

In addition, Armstrong explained
that the point card produces substan-
tial savings. There is no tax on items
purchased with the card, giving the
student a seven percent discount.
Also there are specials in both the
GHQ and the snack bar providing
students with an additional 15 to 20
percent discount. Darrell also said
that over 80 percent of the students
charge their point card home.

In the future, there are plans for a
Bookstore/Snack Bar renovation.
Darrell said, ‘It’s going to be a big
project and we're really excited
about it.”’

Generals clip Eagles {|

to maintain 4th spot

 

By MIKE SHADY
Assistant Sports Editor

 

With just over two weeks left
before the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference tournament, the Wash-
ington & Lee basketball team im-
proved it chances of gaining a
fourth-place position with an upset
win over Bridgewater College, 72-67,
Tuesday night on the road.

The Generals have won two
straight with their victory last Satur-
day over Emory University in the
Warner Center. W&L had its last two-
game win streak stopped last Thurs-
day when Emory and Henry beat up
on the hoopsters, 97-83.

If the Generals can win two of their
next three ODAC games, they will
almost be assured of one of the top
four spots and the home court advan-
tage in the opening round of the
tourney. The squad travels to
Roanoke Saturday and then has
Eastern Mennonite and Maryville on
Feb. 17 and 20.

Bridgewater came into the game in
first place in the ODAC with an 8-2
record, a half game ahead of Emory
and Henry and a full game in front of
Roanoke. But it was the Genrals who
came out looking like the number one

 

a

i

 

team, taking control of the contest
from the opening tip

Playing in front of a partisan
crowd of over 400 people, W&L open-
ed up a nine-point lead eight minutes
into the first half and never trailed
the rest of the way. Junior Steve Han-
cock was the main man for the
Generals, scoring 10 of his game total
12 points in the first 20 minutes. W&L
maintained its advantage until half-
time, leading 40-31 at the intermis-
sion.

Ramsey Yeatts, the ODAC’s
leading scorer, decided to put on a
show in the second half. On a variety
of running jumpers and slashing
drives to the basket, Yeatts proved to
everyone in attendance why he is the
premier player in the conference this
season. He single-handedly brought
the Eagles to within four points with
still over five minutes remaining.

However, the Generals kept their
cool. Showing patience on offense
and even running when the oppor-
tunity present itself, the team jacked
its lead back up to as much as eleven
72-61, with only 1:32 showing on the
clock.

Then the Generals pretended they
were playing Hampden-Sydney in-
stead of the Eagles. If you
remember, the Generals squandered
a 10-point lead in two minutes against
<ne Tigers and ended up in the loser’s

 

circle. W&L’s self destruction this
time began when Hancock and senior
Rob Spencer combined to miss five
front-ends of one-and-one situations.
Neither team starred at the line as
the Eagles shot an anemic 46 percent
while W&L fared little better at 52
percent. A turnover and five-second
call later and Bridgewater was back
in business trailing by five with 22
seconds left.

“We got cautious,” senior Jeffer-
son Harralson, who led the Generals
with 19 points, said. ‘We don’t play
well when we play cautious.

“We thought they had given up
when they took [Yeatts] out but that
may have been a plan in order to get
us to relax. I was kind of relieved
when he went out,”’ he said.

Yeatts returned to the game only to
miss two three-point shots and, for-
tunately for the Generals, time ran
out on the Eagles.

“Coach [head coach Verne Can-
field] was pretty happy about the
game,” Harralson said. ‘‘He was just
happy to get out of there with the
win.”

Sparked by junior Gary Schott’s
career-high 16 points, W&L pounded
Emory University by thirteen, 85-72.
Despite the point differential,
however, Canfield was not pleased.

Team effort paces

Thanks to what head coach Norris
- Aldridge called ‘‘a good team ef-
. fort,’ the Washington & Lee indoor
- track team won five events and took
second place overall in a meet at
Lynchburg College last Saturday.
The overall winner of the meet was
- Virginia State with 130 points. The
Generals scored 110 points and were
followed by the host team with 94
points. High Point College took fourth
with 85 points, and Old Dominion
Athletic Conference members
Bridgewater and Roanoke rounded
out the scoring with 41 and 23 points.
Looking at the field events,
Aldridge cited senior Thomas Mur-
ray as one of the top performers for
the Generals. Murray won the shot
put with a throw of 48’5’’, just 4 in-
ches shy of the school record.

‘track to 2nd place

Sophomore Fray McCormick won the
high jump by clearing 6’2”’.

In the pole vault, the Generals took
first, third and forth place, despite
having lost their two top pole
vaulters earlier in the week. Senior
Matthew Steilberg broke his heel in
practice last Friday, and freshman
Phillip Sampson, who set a school
record by clearing 14’6’’ at VMI last
Saturday, was suspended from the
University last Wednesday. Never-
theless, senior John Carter won the
event with a vault of 12’6”’, and junior
Robert Williamson and Joseph
Fisher also placed.

In the sprints, Aldridge was par-
ticularly pleased with the perfor-
mance of junior Andrew White who
took third in the high hurdles with a
time of 7.8 seconds and ran the 400-
meter hurdles in 54.5 seconds,
finishing fourth in that event.

The Generals also performed well
in the distance events, with
sophomore Jamie Urso taking first in

W&L edges W&M as:

divers prove crucial |

 

From Staff Reports

 

The Washington & Lee men’s
swimming team finished its dual
meet season last Saturday with a win
over William & Mary at Williams-
burg. The five point victory, 111-106,
pushed the Generals’ dual meet
record to 8-1, the best record in head
coach Page Remillard’s eight year
W&L career.

Remillard said that W&L has
beaten W&M four years running, and
the only ‘reason they [W&M] won
before was because diving carried
their swimming.’’ This year,
however, the greatly improved W&L
diving team was the difference.

Remillard stated that ‘our diving
team perservered.”’ He felt that he
and the swimmers ‘‘were really
pleased to see them diving well.”

He added that this is a ‘‘good sign,
we are trying to do something about
our weakness [diving].”” ‘Tom
Amico is the reason why there has
been great improvement this year.”
Amico has basically been the diving
team for almost three years, and his
individual improvement this year,
Remillard feels, has led the rest of

the divers.

Reflecting on the end of the dual
meet season, Remillard said that ‘‘it
has been the best season at W&L”’
since he has been at the helm. He felt
that this was due to the student-
athletes ‘‘out there getting the job
done.”

Remillard attributes the overall
positive team attitude, which was
‘started by the water polo team” has
been carried on by ‘‘an exceptional
group, with captains Jay Reville and
Moose Herring leading.”

This winning attitude, along with a
strong desire to work for success, is
shared by the Women’s squad, which
lays its .500 season on the line Thurs-
day night at Hollins. Remillard felt
that “under the intense academic
pressure of this week,’”’ the women
will have ‘‘to pull a rabbit out of the
hat’ if they are to beat Hollins.

Feeling this study crunch, the team
will compete without freshman
Heather Logan, who owns the top Old
Dominion Athletic Conference times
in both the 100- and 200-yard

breastroke events. Remillard felt
“satisfied [in knowing that this] test

= ‘
of our priorities, academics over
athletics, was successful.” ,

The women have shown their abili-
ty to pull out rabbits, though, as»
evidenced by their win over Sweet,
Briar on Jan. 14, with the top In-
dividual Medley swimmer freshman!
Debbie Grove hampered by the flu.

Remillard said positively that,:
“the women don’t seem concerned”’
about the loss of Logan and the cer-'
tain closeness of th: meet. He added
that ‘‘it will take 66 points to win, and
if we win, we will have less that 70.” *

As the teams look towards Tri-
States, to be swum Feb. 19-21 at ‘
Frostburg, their sights also turn to ,
Nationals in March. The men are
quite strong this year, with swim- ‘
mers in Division III top five in six dif- ,
ferent events.

Freshman David Olson leads the
way, currently ranked second in the’
nation in the 100-yard backstroke and »
thrid in the 200-yard backstroke.
Sophmore Jeff Bercaw is ranked first *
in the 50-yard freestyle, and, like »

The W&L indoor track team, shown in action from the VMI Relays, is aiming to defend its ODAC title on Feb. 28.

the 1000-meter run with a time of
2:23.5. Junior Scott Rippeon won the
two mile, finishing in 10:13.6, and
junior James Buquet ran the 800-
meters in 2:13.5, good enough for
fourth place.

Despite suprisingly poor perfor-
mances in this meet by ODAC
members Bridgewater and Roanoke,
Aldridge says that the Generals need

to show further improvement in
order to have a chance to win the
ODAC championship meet, which
will be held at VMI on Feb. 28. ‘‘It’s
still too early in the season to dis-
count anyone,”’ said Aldridge

The Generals’ head coach is look-
ing forward to entering some of his
athletes in the Lynchburg Relays this
Saturday and in a meet at Virginia

Tech the following weekend. These
two events will give Aldridge a
valuable look at the Roanoke
distance runners, who did not com-
pete in Lynchburg last Saturday, and
at the Emory & Henry team, which
Aldridge says has some good athletes
in the shot put and long jump and
may have the best pole vaulter in the
conference.

But, for most of the Generals, the
upcoming holiday will provide a
week of relaxation which Aldridge
says has been helpful to his team’s
performance in previous years. ‘‘For
the athletes that will go home and do
some running, [the week of] keeps
them in shape but lets their legs
come back. We’re been training pret-
ty hard these past five or six weeks.”’

Wrestlers win one of three;
final meet set for Saturday

By DAVID EMRICH
Sports Editor

 

One up, two down.

That was the story of the Wash-
ington & Lee wrestling team last
week.

The Generals went to the mat three
times, but came away with the vic-
tory only once.

On Saturday, at a dual meet in Lex-
ington, the Generals beat Gallaudet
40-18, but were on the short side of the
decision against Washington & Jef-
ferson, 29-18.

SWIM

O continued from page 6

 

Olson, has qualified for the Division
III championships, to be held in Can-
ton, Ohio, Mar. 19-21.

Last night, the Generals travelled
to Farmville, only to have Longwood
defeat them, 29-18.

The Generals’ record now stands at
7-5 on the season.

‘‘We felt they were a better team
than us,”’ said W&L head coach Gary
Franke.

Winning for the Generals last night
were junior Steve Castle at 126 lbs.,
senior Jeff Mazza at 134 Ibs.,
sophomore Rich Redfoot at 177 Ibs.,
and sophomore George Loupassi at
190 Ibs.

Another Nationals qualifier is the
400-yard Medley Relay team of Olson
(backstroke), senior Marty Radvany
(breaststroke), Bercaw (butterfly),
and sophomore David Dietz (free-

style). The relay team is currently
ranked third, behind St. Olaf and

Kenyon, two perennial Div. Ill
powerhouses.

Castle, who normally wresties at
118 lbs., moved up a weight class last
night to 126 lbs. This gave Longwood
a victory by forfeit at 118 Ibs.

Franke explained, ‘‘We felt
changes had to be made to beat
[Longwood].

“We did some juggling with our
lineup but it didn’t work out.”

Last Saturday, at the dual meet,
the Generals defeated Gallaudet
rather handily, but found Washington
and Jefferson too much to handle.

Winning in both contests for the
Generals were Castle at 118 lIbs.,

The 400-yard freestyle relay of Ber-
caw, sophomores Matt Brady and
David Reavy, and Dietz, are current-
ly ranked fourth nationally.

Senior Jay Reville is currently
ranked number five in the nation in
the 400-yard Individual Medley.

For the women, sophomore Eliz-
abeth Miles qualified for nationals in

Mazza at 134 ibs., and senior Tim
Walker at 142 Ibs.

Castle and Mazza were the only
General wrestlers to win all their
matches last week.

This Saturday W&L will host
Davidson at 2:00 p.m. and Hampden-
Sydney at 4:30 p.m.

This represents a change from the
original schedule where W&L was
supposed to face Davidson on the
road.

Apparently Davidson called and
suggested the new arrangements and
all involved parties agreed.

the 1650-yard freestyle.

Remillard has stated that he feels
that such mid-season listings are
good incentives, but as far as na-
tional standings go, he feels that
“polls are polls,” and that “they
don’t mean a thing until all the swim-
mers meet [at Nationals).”’

 

   

 

 

 

 

&L Athlete of the Week

 

By JOHN PACKETT
Staff Reporter

 

 

 

Elizabeth Miles, the women’s
swim team captain, qualified for
the nationals by finishing first in
the 1650-yard freestyle with a
time of 19:13.00, making her
Washington & Lee’s athlete of the
week,

Miles also placed second in the
100-meter freestyle in the meet
against Mary Washington.

Miles was an Honorable Men-
tion all-American last year and
received W&L’s Outstanding
Woman Athlete for 1985-1986.

Miles said that by qualifying for
one event in the nationals she is
allowed to compete in three, a new
rule established this year.

“It used to be you could only
compete in the event in which you
qualified,”’ said Miles.

To make all-America, Miles
said she has to place in the top
eight of an event. Anything under
the top eight is considered to be
honorable mention.

The nationals are Mar. 13-15 in

Canton, Ohio.

Miles said the team has improv-
ed a lot from last year’s winless
team, which had only three mem-
bers.

“This year we are 43 and are
competing with eight swimmers,”
said Miles.

Miles said the biggest win of the
year was the General’s victory
over Sweet Briar, last year’s
defending Old Dominion Athletic
Conference champions.

The next big meet is the Tri-
States at Frostburg College in
Maryland.

“‘We are psyched for the meet
because it is a real chance to do
well against good competition,”
said Miles.

The training on the swim team
is rough, according to Miles.
Right now the team gets up at 6
a.m. and lifts weights for 45
minutes. Then they practice for 2
1/2 hours in the afternoon.

Miles is a sophomore from
Louisville, KY where she attended
Louisville Collegiate School.

Miles is a psychology major.

Second to no one

The other night one of my friends was leafing through last year’s
Calyx. When he got to the section on the sports teams he said, in-
dignantly, ‘‘Look at this, Lacrosse got three pages!”

I knew why he was upset. You see, my friend is on the swim team
and he feels, like so many other athletes, that his sport is under-
covered. So I asked him how many pages of copy the swim team had
gotten. He said, “‘One ... for both the men’s and women’s teams.”

I looked at him, sort of half smiled, and told him, ‘‘That’s the way it
is.”

People are more interested in some sports than others. Basketball is
more popular than wrestling. Football always gets more spectators
than soccer. And, since there are more lacrosse fans than swimming
fans, lacrosse will naturally get more coverage than swimming. It has
always been that way and it will always be that way.

Athletes who compete in so called secondary sports don’t get the
same fan support as the more popular sports, and this can be
frustrating. A football player struggling to get through a long practice
session can keep the feeling he gets from the fans cheering him on
Saturday afternoon in the back of his mind, but what does the cross-
country runner have to look forward to?

This is especially true at Washington and Lee where support for the
sports teams is pretty much limited to the big three of football, basket-
ball, and lacrosse (and even these don’t always generate that much
student interest).

Athletes who excel at lacrosse will always get more recognition than
those who excel at swimming. Not because one is more difficult than
the other, nor because one requires more work than the other. It’s that
way simply because more people are interested in lacrosse than swim-

Now please don’t get the idea that I’m trying to play holier than
thou. I’m just as guilty as anyone else. I’m much more likely to take a
seat at Wilson Field and watch the Generals play UVa. in lacrosse
than I am to be at Twombly pool to watch the finish of the 100-meter
butterfly against Sweet Briar. But that’s not the point.

Nor is it the point that we should ignore the big three sports in favor
of the rest. By all means Jefferson Harralson deserves all the credit he
gets when he pours in 24 points as does John Church when he stops 25
shorts on goal. But don’t Rich Moore, Ted Myers and Scott Rippeon
deserve just as much credit?

Who, you ask, are Rich Moore, Ted Myers, and Scott Rippeon?
They’re the three W&L cross-country runners who qualified for na-
tionals this past fall. Isn’t that just as impressive as anything any
other athlete has done this year? Still, few people realize that the
cross-country team sent anyone to nationals, much less remember
their names.

The problem with our myopic view of the sports world is that many
great athletes get lost in the shadows cast by the most popular sports.

This year, Chris Gaeris set the W&L career record for most shutouts
by a soccer goalie, and he’s only a junior. How many people know
that? Last year, Tim Stanford was named all-American in both water
polo and in swimming. Yet very few people know who he is. Would that
have been the case if he had won similar honors in football and
lacrosse?

I’m not expecting that Twombly poo! will be packed at the next swim
meet. Watching sports is a form of entertainment, and it certainly
isn’t wrong to choose not to watch a sport you don’t find entertaining —
It is wrong, however, to assume that secondary sports produce second
class athletes.

Writers meet at SBC

 

By MARK TRAINER
Staff Reporter

 

Sharon Olds. Bobbie Ann Mason.
Jay McInerney. Robert Pinksky.

Not only is this a list of some of the
best contemporary writers in Amer-
ica, but it is also sample of some of
the guest speakers currently par-
ticipating in Sweet Briar College’s
“Writing In The ’80’s” Literary
Festival. The festival, which began
last night with a panel discussion will
continue through Friday afternoon.

The critics’ panel is Richard Eder,
principal book critic for The Los
Angeles Times, and Stephen Tap-
scott, who teaches at MIT and Cor-
nell and has distinguished himself as
a poet and translator as well as a
critic. Last night they discussed the
work of the visiting authors, in-
fluences upon them and their rela-
tionships to works by other contem-
porary writers.

This afternoon, Jay McInerney
gave a reading to begin the writers
portion of the festival. McInerney is
the author of two novels: ‘Bright
Lights, Big City’ and ‘‘Ransom.” He
has also been published in magazines
ranging from The Paris Review to
Playboy. “Bright Lights, Big City,”
has extremely successful first novel,
distinguished him as the most elo-
quent voice of the disenchanted
younger generation populating the
clubs and office buildings of New
York and is also currently being
made into a motion picture.
McInerney was born in Hartford,
Connecticut and has lived in London,
Vancouver, Tokyo and New York.

Also reading this afternoon was
poet Robert Pinsky. Pinsky was at
Washington and Lee last Spring in
conjunction with the Glasgow endow-
ment. His most recent collection,
“History of My Heart” (Ecco, 1984),
was awarded the William Carlos
Williams prize by the Poetry Society
of America. Pinsky is considered to
be one of the finest poet-critics at
work in America today. He also
teaches at the University of Califor-
nia, Berkeley and spent seven years
as the poetry editor of The New
Republic.

This evening at eight o’clock, Bob-
bie Ann Mason will give a reading of
her very distinctive fiction. Mason
paints unforgettable portraits of the
varied inhabitants of the New South

with a straightforward, powerful pro-
se style that earned her the Ernest
Hemingway award for the most dis-
tinguished first-published work of fic-
tion in 1982 for ‘‘Shiloh and Other
Stories.’’ Mason currently resides in
Pennsylvania with her husband.
Following coffee and doughnuts at
10:00 tomorrow morning will be a
reading by poet Sharon Olds. Olds
has taught at both New York Univer-
sity and Columbia University. Her
second book of poetry, ‘“‘The Dead
and the Living,’’ was named the La-
mont Poetry Selection of the
Academy of American Poets and in
1985 received the National Book
Critics’ Circle Award for poetry. Her
most recent book, ‘‘The Gold Cell,”
appeared this past January.
Tomorrow afternoon at 2:30, the

literary festival will culminate with a
writers’ panel in which McInerney,
Olds, Mason and Pinsky will discuss
their own work and that of their con-
temporaries as well as the state of
contemporary fiction and _ issues
which affect it.

The Writing in the 80’s Literary
Festival is being sponsored by the
Sweet Briar College Lectures Com-
mittee and the Sue Reid Slaughter
Fund of the Sweet Briar Alumnae
Association. It was organized and
coordinated by Cheryl Mares, Har-
riet Pollack and Janet Sylvester. Of-
fering a line-up of first rate in-
fluences on the best literature being
produced in the United States, the
Writing in the 80’s Festival promises
to be the foremost literary lecture
series in this area in 1987.

How to escape a formula:
Go down-under with Dundee

 

By MICHAEL TUGGLE
Movie Critic

 

Question: Is it possible for a comedy to
succeed outside of the standard com-
edic formulas established in the 80's
(i.e. loss of virginity, taking advantage
of satirized adults by manipulative
adolescents, or taking advantage of
satirized adults by manipulative
adolescents resulting in the loss of
virginity)?

Answer: Absolutely {i.e. “Crocodile
Dundee”)!

Paul Hogan’s ‘Crocodile Dundee’”’ is
like a fresh breath of cool air; it
wakes you up, it’s refreshing, and it
just makes you feel good. As of
January 14, it was ranked third on
the listing for theatre earnings and
had moved into the 43rd position on
the All-Time list, moving ahead of
such classics as “Doctor Zhivago’’,
“The Graduate”, “Out of Africa’,
and ‘‘Apocalypse Now.” This gem
from Austrailia is definitely one of
the year’s best and is destined to give
Hogan the popularity in the U.S. that
he already has Down Under.

The film chronicles the adventures
of Crocodile Dundee, a playfully
egotistic hunter from the outback
who was raised by Aboriginees.
While the film contains traces of the
Greystroke tradition, Dundee is a far
cry from Tarzan. He’s more like the
Artful Dodger in the body of Indiana
Jones. So, we have a hero but no lady
in distress. Enter Sue Charlton (Lin-
da Koslowski), a New York reporter
sent to do a story on ‘“‘The Crocodile
Man.” Her interest turns to fascina-
tion as she and Dundee troop through
the outback together, experiencing
crocodiles, Aboriginees, and fresh-
water lakes ideal for swimming
(need I draw a picture? ). As her time
with Dundee dwindles, her fascina-
tion turns to infatuation (surprise! )
and she asks Dundee to come back to
New York with her as a follow-up to
the story. Right.

The remainder of the film is what
makes it such a pleasure to see. The
naivety and innocence of Hogan’s
character is wonderful and gives
native Americans a real eye opening
account of what it must be like to

come to the U.S. from a technolog-
ically poor homeland. From the mo-
ment he lands in New York, Dundee
moves through a series of classi
scenes. When he is picked up at the
airport in the Newspaper limosine he
is introduced to Gus, the black chauf-
feur. Dundee immediately asks ‘‘Hey
Gus, What tribe are you from?”
When he is told the population of New
York he replies, ‘‘All those people;
living together — New York must be
the friendliest place in the world.”
Hogan is fantastic as Dundee and
provides laugh after laugh. The
scenes where he encounters pro-
stitutes, transvestites, and cocaine
are especially hilarious.

“Crocodile Dundee’’ is a first-rate
production. The acting is well-done,
the humor very funny, and the cine-
matography of Austrailia, often
reminiscent of ‘‘Oout of Africa,’’
quite beautiful. No worries mate!
This film is a treat and one that
shouldn’t be missed.

Students react to newreg

By MARGARET PIMBLETT
Staff Reporter

 

Registration for spring term
classes this week has met with some
opposition by students who dislike
the online computer system being us-
ed for the first time.

The procedure, which allows
students to find out their schedule
within minutes of registering, gives
top priority to seniors to sign up for
classes with less worry of being shut
out of classes which reach their
enrollment limit.

Seniors were allowed to register
Tuesday at the computers, which are
set up outside Northen Auditorium on
Lower Level 1 of the University
Library. Juniors registered Wednes-
day, sophomores today, and fresh-
men will register tomorrow.

Any student who misses the class
registration day has to wait until Fri-
day to sign up for classes.

This system allows first choice of
classes to the first registrants in line.
Once a class is filled, no other
students may enroll.

That irritates underclassmen who
may be closed out of courses by
seniors or juniors.

“To some seniors, it doesn’t matter
what they take, while some soph-
omores will get pushed out of classes
they really want,’’ said Stephanie
Coleman, a sophomore from
Louisville, Ky.

Meredith Walker, a sophomore
from Germantown, Tenn., said, ‘I
don’t think it is fair that people who
are really interested in a class can’t
take it because other people are tak-

ing it for a blow-off.”’
Walker, an art major, said she has

already been blocked out of a spring .

term art class.

But freshman Dave Fischer of
Hebron, Ohio, saw the situation dif-
ferently.

“‘T can see the benefits for seniors.
When I’m a senior I want to have
these same benefits,’’ he said.

Fischer also questioned the class
size limit. ‘‘If these courses are clos-
ing, they ought to make them bigger
or create new sections,”’ he said.

According to University Registrar
D. Scott Dittman, the system is
designed to reduce the work done by
his staff and by students.

“Tt is saving my staff a lot of
duplication of effort,’ Dittman said.
Previously, the registrar’s office
would enter information from
students’ registration forms into the
computer, which would assign sec-
tions of classes with no regard to the
section requests of students.

Dittman said that many students
combatted the situation by register-
ing for dummy courses which they
had no intention of taking, but which
would force the computer to assign
particular sections of other classes
they wanted. The students would
drop the unwanted courses during
drop-add period the first week of the
term, and would pay the $5 drop-add
fee.

With the new procedures, Dittman
said, ‘‘We have no phantom courses
which have to be dropped later on.”’
He said that that reduces the
workload of his staff and means less
effort on the part of the students.

Read decision is upheld

 

From The Roanoke Times
& World News

 

The Virginia State Bar’s
Disciplinary Board was well within
its authority when it disbarred
former Rockbridge County Common-
wealth’s Attorney Beverly C. ‘‘John”’
Read last year, according to a legal
brief filed by the state attorney
general’s office.

In an appeal of his disbarment,
Read said last month that the board’s
punishment was too extreme.

But a response filed at the state
Supreme Court last week by Gregory
E. Lucyk, an assistant attorney
general, said that Read deliberately
concealed information that could
have exonerated a defendant in a
murder-arson case.

Read was accused of hiding the
recantation of a witness set to testify
that Scot Tanner Mesner was among
people watching a 1984 Washington
and Lee University fraternity house
fire that killed a W&L student. The
witness decided during the trial that
Mesner, the defendant, was not the
man he had seen and told Read so.

The witness had repeatedly told
Read and co-counsel about his revis-
ed opinion and finally told Marshall
Mundy, a defense attorney, one night
during the three-day 1984 trial, accor-
ding to Lucyk’s brief.

Read said in his appeal that the
disciplinary board was wrong to
assume he wasn’t going to give the
information to Mesner’s lawyers
The law and the trial judge’s order
required Read to reveal any informa-
tion that could have shown Mesner

was innocent.

However, Lucyk wrote, Read
rested his case without providing the
information. He said that when Read
realized his ‘‘cover-up had been ex-
posed” and that defense lawyers
Eric Sisler and Mundy knew about
the witness’s change of mind, Read
made a “‘belated’”’ attempt to hand
defense lawyer Eric Sisler a hastily
written note, which Sisler refused.

Lucyk wrote that a “grave miscar-

riage of justice” was averted, not by
Read but by the witness and his wife,
who “‘were convinced that justice
would not be served by the pro-
secutor.”’

Soon after Mundy and Sisler charg-
ed prosecutorial misconduct by
Read, the judge dismissed the case
for other reasons,

Applications rise 37%

 

From Staff Reports

 

Washington and Lee has received
to date a record 3,314 applications for
admission to the university’s under-
graduate class of 1991, according to
figures compiled by the Office of Ad-
missions.

The total represents a 37 percent
increase over the same day a year
ago when W&L received 2,416 ap-
plications.

“T tie it to the favorable ex-
periences of the coeducated classes,”
said William Hartog, director of ad-
missions. ‘“The high retention rate
says to counselors, parents, and
students that coeducation is working
at Washington and Lee.”

According to Soott Dittman, uni-
versity registrar, 392 freshmen of
last year’s class of 410 returned for
their sophomore year at W&L, a
retention rate of 96 percent.

Aside from the record-breaking in-
crease in the number of applications,
Hartog said the quality of the appli

cant pool is the strongest it has been
in years.

“Not only is the applicant pool
significantly stronger as measured
by test scores and rank in class, but
also in terms of personal qualities,”’
Hartog said.

In December, W&L admitted 85 ap-
plicants under the university’s early
decision program. Those students
comprise 20 percent of the 420-
member class that will enroll this
fall.

That means competition for the re-
maining 335 places in the incoming
class will be extremely stiff with 10
applicants for each opening in the
class.

“The competition is staggering,”’
said Hartog. ‘‘It is far and away the
most competitive situation we’ve had
in many, many years.”

The applicants to W&L represent
46 states, the District of Columbia,
and 17 foreign countries. The largest
representation, as usual, comes from
Virginia, which accounts for 19 per
cent of the total applicant pool

The ability to make corrections
isn’t the only benefit Vail saw. ‘““You

Beard hired as new
Lexington police chief

 

By MARGARET PIMBLETT
Staff Reporter

 

Lt. Bruce M. Beard of the Lex-
ington Police Department was nam-
ed new police chief in a special
meeting of Lexington City Council
Monday afternoon.

Beard had been acting chief since
the resignation of Chief Lawrence 0.
Sutton in November.

City Manager Joseph C. King
recommended Beard’s appointment
to council after completing a selec-
tion process which reviewed 85 ap-
plications for the position.

The council approved the recom-
mendation unanimously.

“T am quite pleased to have Bruce
Beard as our chief,’’ King said. ‘‘He
has proven himself during three oc-
casions as Acting Chief and perform-
ed very well in the selection process
we just completed.”

The other two finalists for the posi-

tion were Lt. William Hogan of Hun-
tington, W.Va. and Capt. Eugene
Rhodenhizer of Charlottesville.

Beard is a 17-year-veteran of the
Lexington Police Department. He
was promoted to lieutenant in 1974.

A graduate of Parry McCluer High
School, Beard lives in Buena Vista
with his wife and two children, but is
planning to move to Lexington.

Beard said that he thinks the latest
policy of the department in dealing
with W&L fraternities has been work-
ing well, and he plans no changes.
That policy includes the posting of
party noise permits outside fraterni
ty houses. Each permit includes the
name of the person who applied for
the permit and who is responsible for
it.

Among the first duties of the new
police chief will be to submit to the ci
ty manager the department’s propos-
ed 1988 budget and to begin the pro
motion process to fill the lieutenant
position vacated by Beard’s appoint
ment.

Sampson’s appeal in
blow dart case fails

 

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Assignments Editor

 

Phillip L. Sampson Jr. has run out
of appeals.

As had been expected, the Student
Affairs Committee voted on the
Thursday before vacation to uphold
the suspension of the freshman from
Houston. Sampson had admitted to
shooting a 15-year-old girl in the
shoulder with a blowdart

Sampson originally had been plac
ed on social probation and conduct
probation by the Student Conduct
Committee. Because he had inflicted
bodily injury, his act was considered
a major offense under university
rules. The only two penalties that
may be given for such an offense are
suspension and expulsion, unless the

case involves “unusual extenua
tion.”
The 10-member SAC, which

reviews all SCC decisions, could not
find any extenuating circumstances

and asked the 13-student SCC to
reconsider its findings. The SCC then
voted to suspend Sampson for the
rest of the school year.

Sampson appealed the case to the

SAC, which upheld the SCC’s deci
sion

The girl, a local high school stu
dent, is the daughter of W&L
Associate Dean of Students Leroy C
“Buddy” Atkins. She was hit in the
shoulder but was not injured serious
ly.

Atkins, a member of the SAC, par
ticipated in the discussions both of

the times that the SAC heard the
case, but he abstained from voting
either time

The incident occurred after the

W&L-Roanoke basketball game on
Jan. 15. Sampson said he shot the
dart from a second-floor window of
the Graham-Lees dorm toward some
Roanoke fans who making
degrading comments to incite the
W&L students. He estimated that the
Roanokers were between 50 and 75
yards away

Sampson said he knew he could not
shoot the dart that far but thought
that it might intimidate them

University Proctor Charles F
‘““Murph’’ Murray said the dart was
at least four inches long. It hit the gir]
in the back of the shoulder, Atkins
said, penetrating about a half-inch in
to her skin

“The gin in plead said she'd ive

One rule

In the February 19 issue of The W&L Law News, John
Holleran, a defense advocate for honor trials, was quoted as
saying the single sanction penalty of the honor system left no
gray area as a middle ground, it is too black and white. The
editorial in the same newspaper called for a review of the
Law School’s option in relation to a separate system of en-
forcement for the Honor System. ‘Until they do,” the
editorial said, “the current system of enforcement may
make a mockery of the term ‘justice.’ ”’

Students, both undergraduates and law students, need to be
reminded that the only way the Honor System will continue to
work is by keeping the single sanction. Imagine a system in
which the penalties for lying, cheating and stealing are grad-
ed according to their severity, according to how dishonorable
they are. Student would be more likely to commit honor of-
fenses knowing they could still stay at Washington and Lee.
Punishment for these offenses would be the equivalent to a
slap on the wrist.

The Honor System established by Robert E. Lee had no
printed rules, only the unprinted one that students should
conduct themselves as gentlemen. The abolition of the single
sanction would result in the formation of a new set of rules
and regulations stipulating what is and is not a violation, how
serious a violation is and what the particular punishment

should be. This is completely contrary to the spirit of the
Honor System.

An honor system like ours is not easy, but it is worth the ef-
fort. All who attend W&L know what the system is and pledge
to live by it. Those who are intent on weakening the Honor
System, thereby making it similar to other purported ‘‘honor
systems,’ as seen at other schools, are endangering a unique
system that works.

If students can’t live under The Honor System, then
Washington and Lee is not the place for them.

Study abroad promotes understanding

 

MY VIEW
By Paul J. Smith

 

Cambridge, Massachusetts. 20
February 1987. When it was my turn
to speak, I slowly approached the
podium. I knew what I was going to
say but was not too sure how it would
be received by the audience. As a
representative of the People’s
Republic of China, I knew that I
would have to stick to my policy of
non-alignment with the superpowers
and to the commitment to sovereign-
ty in the development of nuclear
technology in the Third World.

I took a deep breath and started:
“Ge wei nin hau, Jintyan wo yau
jyang de timu—”’

“Delegate you are out of order!,’’
exclaimed the chairman of the com-
mittee, a Junior at Harvard.
“English is the official language of
the Harvard Model United Nations
Conference. This was discussed and
decided upon earlier.”

Then I read the prepared state-
ment which I planned to read,
regardless of the committee’s reac-
tion. “I wish to protest the use of
English during this meeting,
especially since it is a language so
identifiable with imperialism which
China stands steadfastly opposed.
The use of English at this interna-
tional conference is an example of
Western linguistic imperialism.”’

That night I was invited to dine
with Brad Boyer and his parents.
Brad, a Senior at Harvard, was the
Secretary General of the Harvard
Model UN conference. He asked me
what I thought about the conference.
I told him about my speech. He was
amused.

Frankly, he said, no one here could
function effectively in any other
language thus rendering English the
only practical common language. In-
deed, I thought, an idea that I had

conjured up in the guise of jest was
much more serious than I had
originally perceived. But it was in-
dicative of a greater phenomenon
even more critical and serious than
just mere linguistic ignorance. When
I told this to Brad, I don’t think it
made him very happy, after all he
had invested hours and hours of his
time in organizing this Herculean
event. I didn’t want to sound negative
or cynical about the conference
which for the most part, I was very
impressed with.

I told him that the fact that most of
the people cannot function effec-
tively in another language seems to
indicate a much larger problem
among American students (which
the Harvard conference primarily
consisted of) in their attempts to
understand reality outside of their
borders, that is, a lack of interna-
tional awareness, exacerbated by the
inexperience of living in a foreign
setting for a significant amount of
time (i.e. a year). I did not wish to
blame the students in this con-
ference, or American university
students in general; after all it is
really not their fault. It’s just the way
the system is set up.

Indeed here at Washington and Lee
the system is not unlike that of many
other universities around the nation
— students, except for those major-
ing in a foreign language, are not en-
couraged to go abroad in their
sophomore or junior years. And in
fact for those students who go to
destinations outside the beaten path
(i.e., Europe) the frustrations in try-
ing to obtain administrative approval
can add up and pose a formidable
obstacle. Such was the case when I
decided to study in the Republic of
China on Taiwan where Washington
and Lee has no established exchange
program. I spent three months
negotiating with several different
committees and negotiating with at
least three or four deans. My efforts
in this undertaking and my subse-
quent success in obtaining approval
added up to nothing less than a small

What’s the matter

 

MY VIEW
By Marie Dunne

 

It’s more than halfway through the
school year now. That’s enough time
for The Ring-tum Phi staff to have
become accustomed to their jobs and
put out the best paper our combined
efforts can produce. It also leaves
plenty of time yet this year for the
Phi to improve.

A politics professor shared an inci-
dent with me the other day that I’d
like to address. The professor was
discussing with his Politics 102 class
the role of the media. Bringing the
issue closer to home, he brought up
the role of the Ring-tum Phi on cam-

pus.
Every student in that class critized

the Phi. Perhaps ‘“‘criticized’’ is too
mild a word — “‘flogged”’ is morgac-
curate. The students don’t likejany-
thing about the Phi, except the srs
page (something Emrich and Shady
will be happy to hear). They grudg-
ingly admitted that the Phi does have
some redeeming value, in that it in-
forms students of upcoming events.
The students admitted this asset only
after prodding from the professor.
When the professor asked what
was wrong with the Phi, students
couldn’t really put their finger on it.
Some said it is “biased,” but couldn’t
agree on to what or whom it is biased.
Some said it was biased toward the
administration. I hardly think the ad-
ministration would agree.

_ The Ring-tum Phi is a student

newspaper. Thus as student staff
members graduate, the management
changes. The Phi run by Sean Bugg is
completely different than The Phi

miracle. And even when I returned,
the bureaucracy was again at my
throat insisting that I was a junior
and not a senior even though they had
already agreed beforehand to accept
the credits from the American
University which sponsored the pro-
gram in Taiwan.

When I reflect on the many bar-
riers I found in my efforts to study
abroad, I become disillusioned,
disillusioned because this university,
like many other universities, does not
seem to recognize that every student
in every field could benefit enor-
mously from an experience outside
his own country — engineering
students would easily benefit by
studying in Germany or other nations
where engineering is strong. Biology
students would gain much awareness
from study in France where some of
the most significant advances in
medicine are made. Students of
politics could benefit enormously
from study in Moscow, or Peking.
English students could go to Great
Britain or New Zealand to enhance
their understanding and perspective
of British literature. I could go on,
but the primary idea here is that the
lacking element in our education at
Washington and Lee lies in the
absence of perspective — perspec-
tive that could be gained abroad.

Thus having written this much I
wish to do more than just present
ideas; I wish to submit a proposal to
the administration of Washington
and Lee. I feel strongly that
Washington and Lee, as a strong, in-
dependent institution of higher learn-
ing, should institute a program which
would allow all students to study
abroad for at least one semester, but
perferably for an academic year.
Certainly logistical problems do exist
for such an ambitious program, but
to some degree the existence of pro-
grams at other American institutions
could aid in providing the infrastruc-
ture within which Washington and
Lee could institute this plan.

It is my belief that as Americans
wish to become more competitive in

with the

run by Mike Allen ’86. To hold the
current management responsible for
any policy or practices from previous
years that may have offended
students is unfair.

This year’s Phi staff is young. The
majority of the editors are soph-
omores, with only one or two juniors
and seniors. When applications were
being taken last year, next to no one
responded. And so the young staff
took charge, for better, for worse.
We’ve made a few mistakes and bad
judgement calls in the past and for
those we are sorry and regretful.

Many of the Phi’s errors, in my
opinion, stem from two areas. First,
that we are a young staff and second,
that we are a small staff. We can’t do
too much about our age, but we can
change the size of the staff.

A little over a dozen people put the
Phi together each week, donating
much of their free time to do so. A

 

REMINDER'

The honor system is only as good as those who administer because they don’t wan’t to lose. Remember, the only failure
it. There are many qualified students at Washington and Lee is in not trying. If you think you can do a good job — run!
who may hesitate in running for a “‘big-three’’ position

the international arena, institutions
of higher learning will respond to this
need with plans such as the one
outlined above. Clearly, the advan-
tages are countless and compelling.
Not only would such a program be
consistent with the spirit of liberal
arts but would also dispell a
dangerous propensity of American
students to engage in tactical rather
than strategic thinking. This point
was best argued by Professor Milton
Colvin in a recent lecture he gave to

his Strategic Intelligence class; in ’
this lecture Professor Colvin com- ,

pared the way Americans solve pro-

blems compared to the Europeans. °

Americans tend to emphasize tac-
tical thinking and problem solving,

whereas Europeans are more theo- *
retical and strategic in their think- ,

ing. Certainly American students
could gain, especially

in the»

theoretical aspects of their fields by ,

understanding the European way of
thinking. On the other side of the
globe, (i.e., China) American

students could learn about long-term |

thinking, and its applications to long-

- term planning.

Basically, we as a university (and «
as a nation for that matter) should .

recognize that we can no longer
engage in the ‘fortress American’
mentality method of approaching our
problems both domestic and
foreign. Washington and Lee is in a
unique position to make the great
leap forward in this area, to institute
a revolutionary program that would

promote international awareness |

and as a result allow its graduates to
possess the competitive edge when

they enter the real world, the interna- ,

tional world. No longer can we ignore
what other nations and other cultures
have to offer. No longer can we ex-
pect ideas to unidirectionally flow

from our shores to other nations. This ~

institution can be the first to institute
what certainly will be future trend in

higher education. Let’s be the first, °
after all what do we have to gain by .

waiting?

Phi?

dozen people can only do so much
work, When an event doesn’t get
covered, it’s often because we lack
the manpower.

Because we lack manpower, we
make mistakes. Because we make
mistakes, no one wants to join the
Phi. It’s a vicious circle that needs to
be broken.

The Phi is the student’s newspaper.
It belongs to you.

I invite anyone who’s critized the
Phi to stop complaining and start
correcting the situation. We need
reporters and ad salesmen (the Phi
isn’t just for journalists. Where are
all the C-school majors?) No talent
for writing? — we need people for
proofreading or copyediting.

One final note — I expect to see all
the members of Professor Connelly’s
Politics 102 class, the motivation of
this tirade helping out in the Phi of-
fice beginning with the next issue.

 

 

LETTERS

Prof says W&L needs to define goals, values

 

 

To the Editor:

I have been following with interest recent let-
ters to the editor indicating student concern over
the present and future development of the uni-
versity. It is distressing that some students find
it difficult to make friends in a co-ed atmosphere
and that others are afraid that Washington and
Lee will evolve into an intellectual center. Col-
lege gives students an opportunity to remake
their lifestyles and plan their future develop-
ment in a sheltered but open environment. They
get another chance, with the benefit of four years
experience, when they go into the “real world’’
or to graduate and professional schools.

From the faculty perspective what makes the
academic process worth while is the ongoing re-
quirement to present old and new ideas in a clear
and coherent way to inquiring and hopefully,
critical students. In such a setting, faculty con-
tinually evolve new perspectives on old ideas and
even formulate some new ones themselves. An
apathetic student body contributes to an apathe-
tic faculty, and vice-versa.

It seems to me that students should hope dur-
ing their college experience, to aggregate a basic
stock of intellectual capital, mold their personal
lives and work habits free from direct parental
supervision, and develop their own individual
personalities. I would very much like to see more

grass roots comment in the letters to the editor
columns positively asserting student ideas of
what Washington and Lee can offer and criticiz-
ing its shortcomings. Idealizing the last decade
at Washington and Lee is not going to prepare
students to solve the humanistic and economic
problems this country faces, we would hope to
keep from slipping into the status of a nation or a
university with great potential that cannot
clarify its goals and values nor effectively mar-
tial its resources.

Lacrosse plays on ‘dry’ fields

Dear W&L Faculty and Student Lacrosse Fans:

The Washington and Lee Generals open their
1987 Lacrosse Season this Saturday, February 28
at 2:00 p.m. versus the University of Virginia.
Due to the unusual weather the Generals will
play UVA at Glen Maury Park in Buena Vista.

The purpose of this letter is to inform all W&L
lacrosse fans that the athletic department’s con-
tract with the City of Buena Vista prohibits the
drinking of alcoholic beverages in public and to

appeal to all you to abide by this alcohol or-
dinance. The City of Buena Vista has threatened
to terminate the contract if this ordinance is ig-
nored.

The W&L lacrosse program is most fortunate
to have the use of this ‘“‘all weather” field for
both practice and games and on behalf of the
players and coaching staff I ask for your
cooperation.

Thank you and I look forward to seeing you at
B.V. this Saturday and for your support this
spring.

WA&L is 7-0 in varsity contests at B.V. Be there!

Sincerely,
Dennis A. Daly
Head Lacrosse Coach

Short and sweet, again

have hesitated to go to the infirmary
because of the stigma attached to
crabs. He suggested that many
students may have gone to doctors
outside the W&L community.

Symptoms of the lice are itching,
especially at night, visible moving
lice in the pubic hair and eggs (nits)
attached to the shaft of the hair. The
treatment is a simple ‘‘one shot
deal,” said Feddeman. A topical lo-
tion is applied to the affected areas,
much like the treatment for head
lice, he said.

Feddeman added that ‘‘all bedding
and clothing should be laundered.”
He suggested the possibility of-
women giving crabs to each other
through the borrowing of clothes.
Crab lice can also be picked up
through the upholstery in movie
theatres and on buses and airplanes

because they are not cleaned often.

It was rumored that Graham-Lees
was fumigated over break, but it is
not true. ‘“‘No requests have been
made for fumigation,’ according to
James Arthur, superintendent of
buildings and grounds. ‘‘I don’t see
how fumigation would serve any pur-
pose other than in the personal rooms
of the students. That can’t be done
other than through the cleaning of
bedclothes and clothes,”’ he said.

Jeff Mandak, head dorm coun-
selor, said that halls occupied by both
men and women were affected.

“T don’t know anyone who has it,”’

New recruitment
group is forming

From Staff Reports

 

An organizational meeting for a
student-run minority recruitment
group is scheduled for Monday,
March 2, according to Dana Bolden,
a sophomore journalism major and
co-founder of the group.

The meeting, open to all students
and members of the W&L communi-
ty, will be held at 7:00 in Commerce
School Room 221.

Bolden, who began the group this
year with sophomore Tom Brickel,
says that while the group seeks to
help attract qualified minorit
students to Washington and Lee, it
not a group just for minority
students.

“We are encouraging as many in-
terested non-minority students as
possible, for without their interest
and involvement, the group will not
succeed,”’ said Bolden.

Diversity, says Bolden, is the far-
reaching goal of the group. “The
group was begun with the idea that
racial diversity at Washington and
Lee is a very real possibility. This
would not only encompass the enroll-
ment of more black students, but
Hispanic, oriental, and a multitude of
other minority students as well.’

Bolden says that instead of becom-
ing a competitive entity to the pre-
sent student recruitment group
operating out of the Admissions of-
fice, the planned minority recruit-

ment group would become a comple-
ment to it. ‘While the student
recruitment already in formation
does a fine job of recruiting all pro-
spective students, we feel that a
student-run organization, formed for
the purpose of promoting the school,
will potentially have a greater im-
pact on effecting minority enroll-
ment.”’

“It will not be a group dedicated to
recruiting minorities simply for the
purpose of recruiting minorities,”
Brickel said. ‘“‘The students we'd
hope to attract would be as serious
about their education as any present
W&L student. However, getting in
touch with those students and in-
teresting them in a Washington and
Lee education will be the challenge.”’

Bolden says that while the group
will remain autonomous from the
school, it will work in close associa-
tion with the Admissions office.
“Their input, especially that of Mimi
Elrod, has been extremely helpful in
the past, giving the benefit of the ex-
perience which we have not had,”
Bolden said.

Any student interested in learning
more about the group is encouraged
to come to the Monday meeting, even
those who question the need for such
a group on campus. “We especially
want those students to provide input,
for their suggestions may alter
aspects or even the general direction
we feel the group should take,”’ con-
cluded Bolden.

MZ Hornets humble W&L;

Hoops season over

 

By MIKE SHADY
Assistant Sports Editor

 

The third time was definitely the
charm on Tuesday night when the
Washington and Lee basketball team
lost to Lynchburg College in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference tour-
nament’s quarterfinals, 82-80, at the
Warner Center.

Three times down the stretch the
Generals made crucial mistakes that
inevitably cost them the ballgame.
With under two minutes remaining
and W&L holding a one-point lead,
senior Fred Bissinger drove the lane
and dished the ball off nicely to junior
Gary Schott. But before Schott could
convert on the almost certain layup,
Bissinger pushed Lynchburg’s Terry
Tabb to the floor. Instead of a three-
point advantage for the Generals,
Tabb hit two free throws to put the
Hornets in front for one of the few
times in the contest.

But the Generals were still in the
hunt until mistake Number 2 arrived.
With 13 seconds left, Hancock flashed
down the baseline and buried a run-
ning one-handed shot to bring the
Generals back to within one. Then
mass confusion hit the scene.

W&L was charged with a timeout
but the Generals had no timeouts re-

maining. The resulting technical foul
gave Lynchburg two free throws and
possession. Peter Soens hit the free
throws and Lynchburg padded their
lead to three and subsequently upped
it to five when the Generals were
forced to foul on the inbounds play.

“I’m not sure (the timeout) was
called,’ said head coach Verne Can-
field. ‘The officials said Hancock
called it. I didn’t hear it called.

“T always tell them how many
timeouts we have, but in the heat of
battle we can sometimes forget,” he
said.

The Generals still had a chance
when sophomore Lee Brading tossed
in a three-point shot with :04 showing
on the clock. And then came the third
and final mistake.

On the ensuing inbounds play, Biss-
inger fouled Mark Manning. But the
official signaled a two-shot inten-
tional foul, instead of the more dif-
ficult one-and-one situation. With the
pressure off, Manning calmly made
both shots and any ideas of ODAC
championships quickly escaped the
Generals’ minds.

‘“‘We always made the effort and
we never quit,”’ said Canfield, ‘but
something always creeps in and
takes away our aggression.”’

The defeat left a sour taste in the
mouths of those in attendance, main-
ly because the Generals had controll-

ed the early portions of the game er
route to a 41-28 halftime lead.

But on the strength of some long
range shooting from Soens, who led
Lynchburg with 20 points, and Fran
Frisby, as well as an excellent se;
cond half from Terry Tabb (19 points
— 15 in the second stanza), the
Hornets slowly climbed back into
striking distance.

The Hornet’s comeback was not
altogether surprising considering the
momentum that was on their side.
Lynchburg wound up their ODAC
schedule by stringing together six
wins, including two wins over
Roanoke, to finish in a tie for fifth
place.

Another old nemesis also hurt the
Generals as they failed to cover the
three-point shooters tightly enough.,
Frisby hit four from downtown and-
Soens nailed three.

“They were reminded about
(Lynchburg’s three-point shooters)
constantly,” said Canfield.

W&L finished its season with a
15-10 record, 8-7 in the ODAC, and the
game marked the final appearance
of the three seniors on the squad: Jef-
ferson Harralson, Rob Spencer, and
Bissinger. Despite the winning,
record, Canfield was not pleased with
his team’s overall performance.

The men’s team, which lost to Fair-

to be held in Buffalo

 

By DAVID EMRICH
Sports Editor

 

This week, the wrestling room at
VMI is a little more crowded than
usual. You see, the Keydets are mak-
ing space for a couple of Generals.

Junior Steve Castle and sophomore
Richard Redfoot have been working
out with the VMI wrestling team in
preparation for the Division III Na-
tional Championships, to be held
Mar. 5-7 at the State University of
New York in Buffalo.

Castle, who finished third at 118
lbs., and Redfoot, who placed second
at 177 lbs., both qualified for the Na-
tional Championships. Castle was
awarded a wild-card berth, while
Redfoot qualified automatically by
virtue of his finish in the Southeast
Regional tournament, held here at
Washington and Lee last Friday and
Saturday, Feb. 20 and 21.

The top two finishers in each of the
ten weight classes, as well as nine
wild-card selections, advance to the
national meet.

“Usually, the third place finishers
in each weight class earn wild-card
selections,’ said W&L head coach
Gary Franke. “Sometimes the fourth
place finisher will make it, but it’s
very hard for someone who didn’t
finish at least fourth to qualify.”

W&L had two additional wrestlers
who finished well, but not well
enough to earn bids to the national
tournament. Senior Jeff Mazza
finished fourth at 134 lbs., and Tim
Walker, also a senior, won fifth place

at 142 Ibs.

Franke was pleased with the per-
formances of both senior wrestlers
but still felt that Mazza might have
done better had he not been hindered
by a knee injury.

The top eight finishers at the Na-
tional Meet are named all-America
and Franke feels that both Castle and
Redfoot have a fair chance to earn
that distinction.

‘Anytime you qualify you have an
outside shot,”’ said Franke. ‘‘A lot of
it has to do with mental prepara-
tion.”

Working out with the Division I
VMI program, Franke feels, is a
good situation for the wrestlers.

‘“‘We’re rotating our staff through
there,’ says Franke. “But some-
times it’s only the VMI people work-
ing witb them.”’

“I’m busy with tennis and [assis-
tant coach] Rolf {Piranian] is tied up
with women’s soccer so we can’t
always work with the wrestlers,”
said Franke. ‘‘But I really think Cas-
tle and Redfoot are in a good situa-
tion.”’

Franke said that he would travel
with the athletes to Buffalo for the
tournament. He said that they would
be leaving next Wednesday, Mar. 4.

A week before the regional tourna
ment, on Feb. 14, the Generals hosted
a triangular meet with Davidson and
Hampden-Sydney.

The Generals narrowly defeated
the Hampden-Sydney Tigers 22-21,
but pounded Davidson 45-10

Those two victories wrapped up the
Generals season with a 9-5 record

mont by over 100 points last year,
returned the favor this year, handing
F.S.C. the second-place trophy by a
score of 444-319.

Head coach Page Remillard felt
that the team ‘“‘had to improve over
the year in order to attain their goal
(of winning Tri-States).”’

Their control of the meet showed
Remillard that, indeed, the men
“had improved to the point where,
even with less than stellar swims,
Fairmont couldn’t beat us.’’ Remi-

lard continued, saying that ‘‘the lack
of overall excitment and pressure in
the meet” caused the men to ‘‘swim
hot and cold.”

He said that he was ‘‘amazed by
how demanding it was to try and
keep on top of two really good
teams.”’

Remillard felt inclined to ‘‘concen-
trate on the womens’ meet, because
nothing could slip or we’d be in trou-
ble.”” The women were in hot com-
petition with the ODAC-champion
Vixens, and the race between the two

teams would not be decided until the
final event of the three-day meet. The
Lady Generals captured fourth
place, outscoring Sweet Briar by only
two points, 266-264.

Remillard felt that ‘the women
swam a super meet,”’ and that ‘‘there
was a battle the whole way.”’ The
Generals lost to Sweet Briar in the
final event, the 4x100 yard freestyle
relay, by .03 seconds, but the Vixens’
time wasn’t fast enough to score
enough points to pull out a victory.

Although the season is over for
most members of both teams,
several swimmers continued to work
out daily in preparation for the up-
coming Division III National Mens
and Womens Championships, held in
Canton, Ohio.

Elizabeth Miles will travel to Can-
ton March 12-14, while seniors Jay
Reville and Marty Radvany continue
to lead David Olson, Jeff Bercaw and
David Reavy in preparation for their
meet, March 19-21.

By JOHN PACKETT
Staff Reporter

 

Junior wrestling co-captain
Steve Castle qualified for the Divi-
sion III National Finals in Buffalo
on March 6 and 7, making him
Washington & Lee’s Athlete of the
Week.

Castle, who has a 20-4 record
this season, finished third in the
118 lb. weight class at last
weekend’s Southeastern Regional
Finals and was picked as a wild
card competitor for the national
finals.

The top two wrestlers in each
weight class qualify for the tour-
nament automatically and then
the coaches pick nine additional
“wild-card” wrestlers to compete
in the finals.

“T placed third in last years
regionals, but I wasn’t selected as
a wild-card wrestler,” said Cas-
tle. ‘It felt great to be picked this
year.

“T think if I work hard enough
these next two weeks I can make

[ W&L_ Athlete of the Weeki

all-American,’’ said Castle.

An all-America wrestler must
finish in the top eight of his weight
class in the nationals.

To help prepare for the na-
tionals, Castle and sophomore
Richard Redfoot, who is also
wrestling in the finals, are prac-
ticing with the VMI wrestling
team for the next two weeks.

“I think the experience will help
because they are Division I
wrestlers and better than any I
have faced so far this year,”’ said
Castle.

According to Castle it takes a lot
of dedication to be a wrestler dur-
ing practice as well as out of prac-
tice.

“You not only have to go to
practice but you also have to keep
your weight down,”’ said Castle.

It is especially hard for Castle to
find weight to lose on his almost
fat-free body.

Castle has a 3.7 GPA as a chem-
istry major and plans to go to
medical school after graduation
next year.

 

 

Shades on sports

Sticking together

Things are beginning to look ugly for major league baseball these
days. What a mess.

The players want more money. The ownefs say get out of town. The
players scream ‘“‘collusion!’’ The owners deny the accusation. The
players vow they'll sue. The owners shrug their shoulders and say pro-
ve it buddy.

Chalk up a small victory for the owners in this all-out, no-holds-
barred war with the players for true free agency and the resulting
higher salaries.

Who are these overpaid (for the most part) athletes trying to kid?
They have no case. Sure the owners are joining forces to drive salaries
down, but the players and their representatives are going to have one
heckuva time trying to prove it.

You see, what the owners are accomplishing now through a
fraternity-like agreement can also be attributed to just plain common
sense. What the incredibly stupid (and, considering how much money
these guys have, it is incredible) owners have done is create a safety
device to protect themselves from their worst enemy — themselves.

Take a gander at some of their mistakes in the past. Two million a
year for George Foster? I think not. How "bout a million five for that
superstars of superstars, Dave Kingman? Don’t get me wrong, some
of the stars today deserve every cent they receive. Mike Schmidt
earns his $1.7 million and Don Mattingly is well worth $1.9 million to
anybody’s ballclub. But sneak a peak at some of the players who are
being ‘‘hurt”’ by this collusion. Lonnie Smith is still unsigned after be-
ing offered over $500,000 from his old club for doing practically nothing
last season. But no!!!! Mr. Smith isn’t satisfied with the combined
salaries of 25 school teachers. This dope (pun intended) wants even
more moolah.

The only travesty is that the players that really deserve the big
money — Tim Raines, Lance Parrish and Jack Morris — aren’t going
to get anything for their efforts and will probably have to sit out until
May (the time when their original clubs can talk with them again). It’s
a shame for both the fans and these unfortunate individuals that they
will not be a part of baseball this year until almost the halfway point of
the season.

Why can’t these owners make intelligent decisions about who gets
the big bucks and who doesn’t? I don’t know. But I’d rather have a

system in which the baseball fan can still afford a ticket to see his or
her favorite star than one in which Ray Knight gets $800,000 a year for
looking like a cabbage patch doll.

Collusion? You bet it is. Can it be proven? No. Should it be stopped?
No. The owners need to stick together because as the old saying goes;
“Twenty-six heads are much better than one.’’ Or something like that.

NOTES: Conference champions in college basketball after the upcom-
ing tournaments: Big East-Georgetown; Big Ten-Indiana; ACC-
Georgia Tech; SEC-Alabama; PAC Ten-UCLA; and Big Eight-
Oklahoma... Rendez-vous ’87 was a huge success. Once again,
athletics is able to step over the bounds of political conflicts and bring
people of the world closer together...

‘Platoon’ is reality

 

By MICHAEL TUGGLE
Movie Critic

 

As I entered the theatre to see
Platoon, I did so with anxious an-
ticipation to see the year’s most
heralded film. I sat excited, waiting
for it to begin; waiting for the war to
totally overwhelm me. I expected a
two hour barrage of blood and
violence that would make me ap-
preciate the Viet Nam war and
perhaps even make me feel as if I
had been there. What I received in-
stead was a lesson in reality: A
lesson in what it means to be a
soldier; a Viet Nam soldier; a
veteran Viet Nam soldier. Platoon is
not Rambo, or Missing in Action, or
any other pseudorealistic glorified
war extravaganza. Platoon is reality.
It is the war. It’s the smell, the taste,
the touch, the Death. It’s just that
real.

Platoon is the account of Chris
Taylor (Charlie Sheen) and the
catharsis he goes through at the hand
of the Viet Nam war. Though Chris is
excited about being a part of the war,
he is naive to it’s horror and to it’s
death. Not until he is faced with an
attack of North Vietnamese late one
night does he realize how lethal war
really is. From that point forward,

Chris begins to harden and eventual-
ly become just a machine to facilitate
death and destruction.

In addition to his own transforma-
tion, Chris is witness to a battle of
wills between Barnes (Tom Beren-
ger) and Elias (Willem Dafore) two
commanding officers with different
personalities and theories concern-
ing the war. While Barnes takes
charge, burning villages and killing
innocent people, Elias is perhaps
more humane, and witholds from
killing unnecesarily. Following the
burning of a Vietnamese village,
Barnes and Elias fight and the pla-
toon splits its support between the
two. Chris places his allegiance with
Elias but finds himself in a pre-
carious situation under Barnes’ com-
mand.

Chris’ final realization of the war’s
futility comes through Elias’ death.
As the helicopter lifts the remaining
members of the platoon out of enemy
territory, with Elias having been kill-
ed, Chris sits numb to the world
wondering if there is anything other
than death and deception. At this
point, Chris becomes Elias’ avenger
and reaches his final state toward the
end of the film as he massacres a
group of Vietnamese soldiers in a

nighttime raid. Overrun and nearly
defeated, the captain of Chris’ pla-
toon calls for an air strike of napalm
and the area is destroyed.

Chris reflects on the horrors that
he has seen and comes to his final
resolution as he flies toward home,
now sheltered from everything but
the memories and the nightmares.
The task now is learning how to live
with them.

Platoon is reality. It is not a film
about the good guys winning or one
with a happy ever after ending. It’s
about the 2.7 million Americans that
laid their lives on the line in Viet
Nam and came home to a lethargic,
critical homecoming. It’s about the
men that lived through hell while an
indecisive government refused to
send more troops or pull out. It’s
about the thousands of Americans
who lost their lives in combat there.
It’s about the survivors who are left
to live with the memories. It’s real.
You can almost feel its realness. And
if you can’t feel it, you can see it in
the tears of the veterans who walk
out of the theatre. Platoon is the way
it was and the way it will hopefully
never be again.

Megadeth is not quality metal

 

By CHARLIE GAY
Staff Reporter

 

Is Iron Maiden just too tame for
your listening needs? Do you con-
sider Black Sabbath lullaby ma-
terial? If so, Megadeth’s most recent
offering, Peace Sells...But Who's Buy-
ing? could be right up your alley. But
not if you’re a connoisseur of quality
metal.

One of the : ost ballyhooed of the
current wave of speed metal bands,
Megadeth consists of Dave Mustaine
on lead vocals, lead and rhythm
guitars, David Ellefson on bass,
Chris Poland on lead and rhythm
guitars, and Gar Samuelson in
charge of drums. Yes, those are
guitars responsible for the pseudo-
metallic sludge that pervades the
overwhelming majority of the
album, not jackhammers, chain-
saws, and the like. The term vocals is
also used loosely, shrieks and grunts
perhaps being more appropriate. In
short, the musicianship on this album
is almost uniformly terrible, the
lyrics, when decipherable, are
generally ridiculous; and _ the
delivery, although occasionally ir-
ritating, is usually laughable. To be
quite blunt, Peace Sells sucks

Actually, to be more specific,
Megadeth is a second-rate version of
the kings of speedmetal, Metallica.
This shouldn’t really be any surprise,
either, as group leader Mustaine was
an original member of Metallica.
What separates Metallica from these
Megadeth — upstarts is merely a
wealth of musical and lyrical talent.
Although lengthy, Metallica’s songs,
particularly “Leper Messiah’’ and
“Orion” off their most recent release
Master of Puppets, the riffs are often
classically based, and thus well
structured, coherent and imagina-
tive. Most of Megadeth’s tunes are,
on the other hand, chaotic, frenzied,
and directionless, even on a
marginally good tune like ‘‘Good
Mourning/Black Friday.”’ Lyrically,
like Metallica, Megadeth obviously
has a lot to say in terms of social
criticism. However, Mustaine rushes
the words in an effort to keep up with
the melodies (ha, ha), losing any ef-

fect. Even when Peace Sells doesn’t
fall flat, like in parts of ‘“‘Wake Up
Dead” and all of ‘Peace Sells,” the
reason is that they sound like an im-
itation of Metallica.

‘Peace Sells’’ is the major excep-
tion to the rule. Starting out with an
ear-catching bass riff from Ellfson,
the song proceeds in a basically
orderly fashion, and upon becoming
chaotic (at the end), it features some
very inspired jackhammer,.— I
mean guitar, — playing. The metal is
neck-snapping potent, and this is the
only song in which the vocals are
largely understandable. Megadeth
voice in the song what it seems
Metallica has been thinking all
along: ‘‘If there’s a new way, I'll be
the first in line/It’d better work this
time.”

The only other track of merit, “I
Ain’t Superstitious,’’ shows off
Megadeth’s imagination and is

perhaps more indicative of the
band’s potential than ‘Peace Sells.”
An ancient tidbit penned by old
Mississippi bluesman Willie Dixon is
‘ transformed, though not altogether
successfully, into a blues/speed
metal fusion that makes for in-
teresting listening. Megadeth are
real trailblazers here: there is really
nothing to compare it to on viny),
cassette, or compact disc out there.
So, although Peace Sells is not an
impressive album debut for Mega-
deth by any stretch of the imagina-
tion, there is still hope for these guys
yet. An expansion on the imagination
that spawned “‘I Ain’t Superstitious’’
could earn Megadeth its own niche in
the American metal scene. Until
then, if you’re just itchin’ to soothe
yourself with some speed metal,
Metallica’s Master of Puppets and
Ride the Lightning albums should be
just what the doctor ordered.

No Fancy Dress Ball is complete
without an orchestra.

This year, the Student Activities
Board has signed what is certainly
one of the great big bands in the
history of popular music: The One
and Only Tommy Dorsey Orchestra.

Conductor Buddy Morrow, one of
the all-time great trombone players,
will bring the legendary Dorsey Or-
chestra to Doremus gym this Friday
night.

In retrospect — and in big band
history — Tommy Dorsey’s must be
recognized as one of the greatest all-
around dance bands of them all.

It could swing with the best of
them, and no other band could come
close to Tommy’s when it came to
playing ballads. Tommy Dorsey,
“The Sentimentally Gentleman of
Swing,”” was a master at creating
moods — warm, sentimental and
forever musical moods — at superb
dancing and listening tempos. And,
what’s more, Tommy selected ar-
rangers who could sustain those
moods — Paul Weston, Axel Stor-
dahl, and Sy Oliver. He showcased
singers who could project those
moods wonderfully — Jack Leonard,
Frank Sinatra, Jo Stafford and The
Pied Pipers and others.

This was the era in which the band
was at its best. In the summer of
1941, it outranked every other band to
finish first in one of the most in-
dicative of all popularity polls
—Martin Block’s ‘Make Believe
Ballroom” contest. Actually, this
may have pleased Tommy less than
most people suspected, because for
years he had subscribed to the theory
that it’s best not to be Number One
because, once you get there, you
have no place to go except down.
Jack Egan reports that at one time,
on Tommy’s instruction, he went out
on the road and extolled the virtues,
not of Tommy’s band, but of Artie
Shaw’s because Tommy was scared
that he himself might be getting too
popular!

By late 1946, it was becoming ap-
parent that the band business was
getting worse and worse. In a single
month of December 1946, eight top
bandleaders announced they were
calling it quits — Woody Herman,
Benny Goodman, Harry James, Les
Brown, Jack Teagarden, Benny
Carter; Ina Ray Hutton and Tommy
Dorsey!

For all intents and purposes, this
was the official end of the Big Band
era. And yet, it was Tommy Dorsey,
more than any of the other big
names, who in the years immediately
following was to fight the cause of the
big bands — with words and with ac-
tion. Less than two years later, he

was fronting a formidable new
group.

And so it continues, THE TOMMY
DORSEY ORCHESTRA, conducted
by BUDDY MORROW, is traveling
throughout the country and playing
for the kids (of all ages).

Buddy Morrow as conductor of The
One and Only Tommy Dorsey Or-
chestra insists that the band retain
the authentic sound and style of the
late Tommy Dorsey and still have the
elasticity to meet almost every
musical situation. His repertoire em-
braces, not only the classics of the
original Tommy Dorsey Orchestra
but the spectrum of popular music
from Dixieland, rhythm and blues,

 

 

intricate ballads to progressive jazz
or current rock tunes, and his library
also has a nostalgic representation of
those familiar tunes of the 40’s so ir-
replaceable to the many who loved
and remember ‘“‘Big Bands.”’

Buddy Morrow is one of those rare ,

BIG BAND LEADERS of today; a
man whose s‘.ill on his horn is both an
inspiration to his band and a thrill to
audiences wherever he appears. The
combination of THE TOMMY DOR-
SEY ORCHESTRA and BUDDY
MORROW is as natural as peaches
and cream, and we trust you will
agree, that what comes out best is
what’s put in naturally,

By now, you have already
wielded the most coveted
leverage of the W&L student:
The Fancy Dress Bid. And now
it is time to find out what just
rewards you and your highly
selected date shall reap from
the Student Activity Board's
80th Fancy Dress Ball presenta-
tion. Slap on Your Banana
Republic cumberbund and get
ready for the African jungle ex-
perience of “The Dark Conti-
nent”’ in the Warner Center and
Doremus Gymasium on March
6.

Glenn Smith, Fancy Dress
director of the SAB, anticipates
the flamboyant creation of a
jungle-like atmosphere com-
plete with the exotic mysticism
associated with Africa. Thi
torches will light the garden
walkway to the entrance which
will have the usual red carpet
along with a lit sign in the shape
of the African Continent. At the
doorway, guests will be met by
a trick performing elephant
while just inside the entrance,
on the right, is the cite for an
elaborate bamboo hut.

The entrance hallway itself
will be adorned with an over-
abundance of verdure: ivy,
ferns, bamboo, palm leaves;
and the trophy cases will be fill-
ed with African masques and
other simian artifacts.

You better hold on tight to
your Meryl Streep’s hand when
you enter the “Out of Africa”’
Warner Center. Here, in which
the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra
will alternate sets with the Steel
Drum Band, is the site for
SAB’s seventy man made
banana trees, which have real
banana leaves imported
straight from Africa. A jungle

jungle mural will top the
bleachers of the gym with
shogun-type bamboo huts lin-
ing its bottom.

The orchestra will be placed
in front of a swarthy back-
ground, and two other bamboo
huts will be put on its right and
left

To add to the jungle effect,
there will be green and blue
theatrical lights hung from the
ceiling which will illuminate an
occult haze produced by a
smoke machine in the rafters.

On the balcony of the Warner
Center, and only here, the SAB
will be serving Michelob and
Michelob Light to wrist band
wearers; the wrist bands,
which only will be given to those
of age, will be given at the ticket
sales. Beer can be taken down
off the balcony into the or-
chestra area, but no beer, ac-
cording to Smith, can be taken
out of the Warner Center.

The crowd, of course, will be
packed into the Doremus Gym
which will continue with the
SAB’s bushy theme with three
green parachutes covering the
ceiling; the top of the balcony
will be decorated in green and
blue Christmas lights.

Winter Hours, a pithy band
which last year warmed up for
Let’s Active, will kick off the
night; the Little Saints will
follow and the Hoodoo Gurns,
an appropriately exotic choice,
will headline. Remember, beer
cannot be taken out of the
Warner Center into Doremus so
be sure to bring your buzz with
you.

In addition to all this hoopla
and merry making, Smith ex-
pects to have various actors
roaming the gyms in lion and

gorilla costume, and even
possibly a fire-eating act, may
be in the works.

The season for extended bids

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Assignments Editor

 

You know Fancy Dress is
right around the corner when
National Condom Week arrives.

“Rubber week’’ ran from
Feb. 14-21. “FD Week” starts
Monday.

The real reason our nation’s
movers and shakers scheduled
National Condom Week for
when they did was not to get
students at Syracuse University
to send condomgrams to their
not-quite-so-responsible loved
ones on Valentines Day,
although more than 300 were
sold.

And the real reason that mag-
azines are just now beginning to
allow condom ads is_ not
because of a fear of AIDS. Both
are in recognition of what we all
call ‘‘the South’s Greatest Par-
ty.”
FD couldn't have received
that nickname by just being an
overblown prom in a Lexington,
Va., gym. It couldn't have
received that name if it were
simply a gathering of a big band
and a smattering of pretty good
rock bands.

The fact is that this place
rocks on FD weekend, especial-
ly the dorms, Woods Creek, and
the fraternitv houses. Enter Na-
tional Condom Week and date-

rape seminars.
If you want to see the effect

that condomization has had,
hang out in McCrum’s tor a
while and see how many people

— guys and gals — buy boxes of
Sporting goods. But increased
condom sales are not the only
indication that it’s beginning to
look a lot like FD.

There are the easily recog-
nizable signs — flower and tux
sales, a mad rush at the dry
cleaners, the constant talk
about “‘extending the bid.”

Groups of young men swarm
around one of their buddies,
chanting “Ask her. Ask her.’’
With coeducation, girls are say-
ing, ‘‘Ask him. Ask him.”

Frat houses return to life,
even on weekdays. Swarms of
girls, even ones with tattoos on
their backs, are everywhere,
especially in the Pit on band
nights. Road chicks start phon-
ing W&L guys they had met the
first week of school, and vice
versa. ‘‘Hi, remember me ....’’

Bid seekers get their hair cut
and start dressing nicely. Slobs
like myself clean their rooms.

Drug and alcohol use both in-
crease.

One-week wonders wallow in
the weightroom. Everyone’s on
a diet, trying to slim down or
bulk up.

Professors get involved, too.
They seem to increase the
number tests, papers and com-
puter assignments. And they’re
always due at precisely the
time your date’s supposed to ar-
rive or leave, or at the exact
moment you feel like sleeping
off the weekend.

Even parents get in the act.
Some don’t want you to spend

any money. Others will send
money in hopes that their sons
and daughters will get dates.

Girls are flipping coins, draw-
ing slips of paper out of hats and
throwing darts, among other
things, in order to decide whom
to ask, or whether or not to say
“tyes” or ‘“‘no.”’

Soon there will be increased
animosity toward the SAB.
There will be complaints about
the bands, the theme, the shirts
and the posters. Anyone who’d
complain about the cost already
has been doing so since the SAB
lost $17,000 on the Spinners, if
not before.

Condom Week was a new
sign. So was an outbreak of
crabs in the dorms. One of the
most surprising signs has been
the recent resurgence of anti-
coed sentiment. Obviously, they
are bracing all of us for the an-
nouncement that the phrase
“extending the bid”’ is somehow
sexist, and that to say it may be
considered a major offense
under university rules.

About the only sign that didn’t
make sense was the close prox-
imity of FD and Black History
Month, which was held in Feb-
ruary. But with this year’s
theme — The Dark Continent
—all the pieces seem to fit
together.

Okay, so maybe we are a few
weeks behind everyone else on
Black History Month and Na-
tional Condom Week. Then
again, we were years behind on
coeducation.

The official date given for the
first Fancy Dress Ball is
February 1907. That’s eighty
years ago, for those of you
without a calculator. But that’s
not, necessarily, eighty Fancy
Dress Balls. Indeed, the history
of our little winter term shindig
is rich with anecdote and
cultural significance.

It is appropriate that we look
back at the origins of Fancy
Dress on this, its eightieth birth-
day. Although the common
belief is that a one Miss Annie
Jo White started FD all those
years ago, actually the idea of a
major ball was brewing long
before her initial efforts

The first reference to a ‘‘Fan-
cy Dress”’ anything was a blurb
in the September 27, 1876 isssue
of the Southern Collegian concer-
ning a ‘‘Fancy Dress Hop’’. For
nearly a decade before that,
however, students here had
been putting on dances and hops

Fancy Dress: Eighty years and counting

The first real Fancy Dress
Ball came a decade later. The
school’s then-current librarian,
Miss Annie Jo White, enter-
tained a group of her student
friends with a costume party
one February evening in 1907.
Because she felt that the
students needed something to
spark up the mid-winter dull-
ness, she sought to make the af-
fair an annual event.

It took some doing, but she
eventually rustled up enough
student enthusiasm to make the
Fancy Dress Ball one of the
highlights of the W&L social
calendar. Miss White was the
undisputed Queen of Fancy
Dress for 13 years, and in later
years was even paid $50 for her
services.

It was after her death in 1922,
however, that the Fancy Dress
Ball really took off. By 1928, the
New York Times described it as
“the South’s outstanding col-

ball was something entirely dif-
ferent from the event we
celebrate now. For starters, it
was a costume ball, elaborate
and glittering, with exotic Euro-
pean themes setting the pace.
Famous big bands frequented
the ball, and the music was
routinely broadcast on network
radio hook-ups all over the na-
tion. Fancy Dress, it has been
observed, began the same year
Henry Ford was working on the

 

first Model T: It was the
quintessence of the Edwardian
Age.

Fancy Dress was elaborate,
aristocratic, imaginitive, and
even perhaps snobbish. But it
was born out of an ernest desire
to create a wonderland here on
campus, and more often than
not, succeeded.

There were no Fancy Dress
Balls during the second World
War, and the tradition didn’t
quite survive the turbulant Six-
ties, but through it all, Fancy
Dress just seems to keep crop-
ping up every winter. Like a
breath of fresh air.

Off to the ballroom, ladies
and gentlemen.

The group that MTVee-Jay
Martha Quinn calls ‘‘The
Ugliest Band In Rock and Roll”
will take the stage Thursday
night at the student activities
pavillion for a show that pro-
mises to be a real crowd
pleaser.

Otherwise known as the Del

Fuegos, this gritty, unMTV
foursome packs a power-chord
punch that never quits from the
word ‘‘Go!”’ The guitar-playing
Zanes brothers front the act
with Warren’s fiery, raw guitar
lead providing a devilish ac-
companiment for Don’s confi-
dent cigarette growl-whine
and rythm guitar. Bassist Tom
Lloyd and drummer Woody
Giessmann round out the band
and drive the tunes home, per-
forming as well as a rhythm
section twice their size. Despite
the economical line-up, the Del
Fuegos have a big sound that
pounds its way into listeners of
all tastes.
. Songs from their 1985 release,
Boston, Mass. constitue the bulk
of their live material. The
album chronicles a rock band’s
existence on the road and at
home, studded with failed
romances, old cars, nightclubs,
and loneliness, performed in a
traditional style that recalls the
rock and roll hooks of the mid-
60’s and the New Wave intensity
of the early eighties.

Del Fuegos win

Want You’’ drifts along on a sea
of watery keyboards and loose
guitar work that Doors fans will
recognize from ‘‘Riders On The
Storm.’’ Don Zanes hoarsely
rumbles, ‘“‘The car we bought
together just started to
rust/The world we made came
between the two of us,”’ lending
a unigue touch that gives this
tale of adolescence an honesty
missing from today’s formula
rock.

The real grabber on the
record is the number ‘Don’t
Run Wild,’ where Don ad-
monishes his girlfriend at home
to stay true. His entreaty might
also serve to keep those Fancy
Dress dates in line. Later,
Zanes assures her that “It’s
Alright,”’ purring, “I love you
baby, I love your cat/I love the
way you look at my fireman’s
hat.” Truly a line to sweep any
female of her feet — if you're a
Del Fuego.

In ‘Fade To Blue,’’ Don in-
forms the object of his affec-

ugly...

tions that ‘‘I Believe I should be
the one, so I’ve come to help you
take him down.”’ However, the
boys are not all braggadocio, as
they croon wistfully for
“somebody whose days keep
troubled nights away.” This
dream-girl arrives at night to
whisk them away in her ‘‘Coup
de ’’ille.”’

Despite little commercial
success, concertgoers may
recognize the band from the
Miller beer commercials in
which they performed “‘Miller’s
made the American Way.”’
Warren Zanes makes a cameo
appearence at the end, saying,
“Rock and roll is just folk
music...’cos_ it’s made by
folks.’

The Del Fuegos blend
together this street-tough
honesty, classic rock and roll,
and the Eighties oomph to per-
form irristibly. An added bonus
in case you decide to buy the
album is a little free advice:
“Play this record loud.”

Concrete Blonde: Ready to make history

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Entertainment Editor

 

 

On Johnette Napolitano’s
ninth birthday, she received a
guitar and a “Play Guitar with
The Ventures” record as a gift
And the rest, they say, is pup
history.

Well, maybe not. Let’s try
again. Jim Mankey met
Johnette while playing with
Leon Russell in 1980, decided to
form their own band, called it
Dream 6, put out a couple of
records, made it big in Europe,
changed their name to Concrete
Blond, got a new drummer, and
the rest, they say, is pop
history.

One last try: Concrete Blonde
is a power rock trio from Los
Angeles fronted by a woman
who has been favorably com-
pared to Chrissie Hynde but
who is as much her own person
as youor I.

Concrete Blonde is one
blistering rock and roll bnad.

Concrete Blonde is opening up
for The Del Fuegos. So don’t
miss them.

Still not satisfied? The band’s
first album was released on
I.R.S. records this year and has
already become a staple on col-
lege radio stations all over the
country, including our own in-
famous WLUR. One track,
“Still in Hollywood,” is current-
ly enjoying medium rotation as
a video on MTV and would pro- ;
bably find it’s way onto
WLUR’s airwaves if the DJ’s
had a means to beep out a cer-
tain four letter expletive used in
the song’s lyric. Nonetheless,
the record contains plenty of
other stand out tracks, in-
cluding ‘“True,”’ “Beware of
Darkness,”’ and “Dance Along
the Edge.”’

The band’s sound is classic
trio rock somewhere between
the Gang of Four and the Who.
Johnette’s powerful lead vocals

   

 

 

have predictably illicited com-
parisions to the Pretenders, Pat
Benetar, and Joan Jett. But
Concrete Blonde has a sound
distinctively their own.

What do the critics have to
say about Concrete. Blonde?
Cashbox, in their standard cor-
porate view, said, “Will garner
play if anyone takes time to
listen.’’ Which says nothing.
Music Connection, on the other
hand, wrote , “‘About once or
twice a year, a record from an

unknown band just blows me
away, and this is one of them.
Perhaps it should just be called
great rock and roll.” And Rock
Non Stop, a rock magazine from
France, perhaps put it best:
‘*..inconnu, presque tarte, sous
la pochette un peu froide, pas
immediatement sexy...un rock
americain eighties-
californiennes...’’ Which about
says it all.

Don’t get the idea that Con-
crete Blonde is a bunch of

 

 

 
 

rookies. As Dream 6, they made
quite a reputation for
themselves as an outfit to be
reckoned with. But record com-
pany after record company,
though showing interest, felt
there were just too many rough
edges for the band to make it in
mainstream Americana. So
Dream 6 kept turning down of-
fers.

Then one day Miles Copland,
unwittingly saw the band and
said, “Sign ’em up, as is!”

Which is what Miles did. The
final icing on the cake was their
meeting Michael Stipe, who, in
his typically obscure manner,
dubbed the band Concrete
Blonde. Mr. Stipe could not be
reached for comment. Johnette
liked the name, saying, ‘Yeah,
like a dirty Hollywood sidewalk
name, maybe a little hard but a
little soft...and we’re not even
blonde! OK!”

And finally, the rest, they say,
is pop history.

Hoodoo Gurus: Pre-fab neo-paisley hip?

By JIM BENNETT
Staff Reporter

 

The Hoodoo Gurus. Who are
they and what kind of name is
that?

The answer is fun music that
will get you smiling, dancing
and trying that much harder to
get a date for Friday night.
These boys from Down Under
were into paisley before it
became hip, but don’t let that
give you any wrong ideas about
their music. What they play is
not neo-psychedelia but good
time/high energy music that
launched them onto the college
charts some two years ago with
their debut album Stoneage
Romeos.

Their second release Mars
Needs Guitars further solidified
their North American base of
admirers with such hits as “‘Bit-
tersweet’’ and ‘‘Death-
Defying,” helping to put it in the
No. 1 position on the college
charts.

Their latest record, Blow Your
Cool, has just been released and
will undoubtedly be treated to
our ears Friday night.

“(It’s our) earnest desire to
animate the music and au-
dience simultaneously’ says
Dave Faulkner, the lead singer,
rhythm guitar, and songwriter
who formed the band in Pertn
seven years ago. The other
blokes in the band aren’t too
shabby either. Brad Shepard

handles lead guitar (and
sometimes vocals). Clyde
Bramley, on bass, and Mark
Kingsmill on drums form the
tight rhythm section that con-
tributed to the sellout crowds in
Australia and New Zealand.

Between March 21 and May
18, the Hoodoo Gurus will cover
the eastern seabord of the U.S.
and Canada, down to Florida,
across the south and mid-west,
up to Vancouver and down the
west coast. Like their good-
time/high energy music,
they’re moving fast and not to
be missed. Perhaps it’s a com-
bination of isolation and _in-
fluence that has bred the unique
hybridgs of style coming from
these Australian musicians.
Whatever the secret, these guys
have a proven ability to cut it on
the concert circuit, sell records
and garner critical acclaim.

The blokes:

Dave Faulkner, is a child of
the baby boom. A
knowledgeable exponent of pop
culture, he admits to being in-
trigued by writers of such
diverse eras and styles as
Rogers and Hart, Irving Berlin,
Frank Loesser and Hoagy Car-
michael. Unlike many pop
songs, the work of these musi-
cians often reveals unusual
rhyming and rhythm patterns,
verse and chorus structure.
He’s also equally at home
listening to a 50’s do-wop disc as
he is a synth-pop masterpiece.
Dave Faulkner’s songs can’t be

neatly boxed, but straddle

many catagories and when
played with the group’s high
energy and good humor, the
results invariably induce strong
and positive reactions from
fans and critics alike.

Brad Shepherd plays with in-
credible versatility and has
been accused of ‘cutting loose
all over the place with some
scorching licks.’ Then someone
else said he had ‘‘the best from
the book of Psychedelia’s
Greatest Hits.”” But don’t ask
about his humor or mimicry —
it’s wicked.

KA and Phi Psi experience fraternity woes

VMI Cadets attack Phi Kappa Psi

~

By SAMUEL FOLEY
Staff Reporter

 

One Washington and Lee student
and six Virginia Military Institute
Cadets were arrested last Saturday
evening after a large brawl broke out
between the members of the Phi Kap-
pa Psi fraternity house and 75 to 100
cadets.

“They came prepared to fight,”’
was the way Sgt. T. H. Pederson of
the Lexington Police Department
described the VMI Cadets who ap-
peared at the Phi Kappa Psi fraterni-
ty house. ‘“‘Several of the cadets had
their hands wrapped in tape and
were wearing mouth pieces. It was
strictly an organized raid. Very
organized,’ Pederson said.

The brawl started after two cadets,
M. G. Murray and and William E.
Miller, were asked to leave a party at
the Phi Psi house, according to Lex-
ington Police Chief Bruce Beard.

The cadets said that they were ask-
ed if they belonged at the party, to
which they said they did not. The
cadets said that immediately after
this, they were attacked by six to 10
W&L students.

Phi Kappa Psi President John
McDonald disagreed with the ac-
counts from VMI on how the fight
started. ‘“‘Two VMI cadets came to

the door and were not allowed in. I
know they were asked to leave and
the people working the door were
having some trouble getting them to
go.” He said that words were ex-
changed and some punches were
thrown.

McDonald denied the report that
the two cadets were attacked by six
to 10 students. ‘‘I know that can’t be
true because we only had two or
three guys working the door,” he
said

After the fight had been broken up,
the cadets returned to VMI where the
story of what had happened spread
through the barracks, according to
the reports the cadets filed at VMI.

At approximately 12:30 a.m., 75-100
cadets were seen by Sgt. Pederson
and W&L proctor Charles “Murph”
Murray gathering behind the Phi Psi
house. Pederson and Murray tried to
put themselves between the two
groups and more police officers were
summoned to the scene.

“We got to the scene before it got
really bad. We managed to keep most
of the people separated,’”’ Pederson
said.

According to reports from VMI, the
officer on duty was called at around
one in the morning and told that there
was a group of cadets outside of a
fraternity house and that that trouble
was brewing. The officer immediate-

ly posted guards around the barracks
to prevent more cadets from leaving
the post and to identify any returning
from the brawl. He then proceeded to
the scene.

On the way to the house he met
several cadets on the street who were
heading into town. He ordered the
cadets to return to the post and
report to the officer of the guard,
which none of them did.

In addition, none of the cadets who
were at the scene were identified
upon returning to the post, so no
disciplinary action can be taken.

When the officer arrived at the
scene, the cadets had disbursed, and
he went to the police station to check
on the cadets who were arrested.

Capt. Harold Willcockson, deputy
commandant of VMI, said the
reports that the cadets had filed to
his office indicated that the incident
was started by the Washington and
Lee students.

When asked how such a large
number of cadets could get off cam-
pus to participate in such a raid
without being noticed, Capt.
Willcockson responded that the
cadets crawl out through windows in
the back of the barracks and sneak
off the back of the post.

KA punished for scavenger hunt

 

By SAMUEL FOLEY
Staff Reporter

 

The Kappa Alpha pledge program
has been suspended as a result of a
scavenger hunt that took place in
Washington D.C. and several other
cities which led to one student spend-
ing the night in jail.

According to Dean Leroy C. ‘‘Bud-
dy’ Atkins, a group of KA pledges
went to Washington D.C. on the
weekend of January 10 to obtain
various items. In the course of the
scavenger hunt, a student was ar-
rested for trying to steal a license
plate from a car. In addition, an
American flag was stolen from a na-
tional monument.

The punishment was handed down
in a special meeting of the Inter-
Fraternity Council judicial board on
the Thursday before the Washington
break.

Atkins said that the reason the case
was heard in the special meeting was
that the incidents had become public
knowledge and been in the air so long
with “E.C. problems” that the IFC
thought it was best to deal with it as
soon as possible.

The full punishment handed by the
IFC and approved by SAC is:

The Big Three candidates at Wednesday’s forum.

Big Three candidates all
agree on single sanction

 

By SEAN BUGG
and JOHN PENSEC
Staff Reporters

All candidates for the Big Three
Executive Committee offices, presi-
dent, vice-president and secretary,
support the single sanction honor
system. One presidential candidate
called it ‘the foundation of
Washington and Lee.”’

The Honor System was just one
topic discussed at an E.C. sposored
candidate forum yesterday. Other
topics included the law school,
jurisdiction of the honor system and
the transition to coeducation.

The forum was originally schedul-
ed for Tuesday but was postponed at
Monday night’s E.C. meeting. It was
learned that posters notifying can-
didates of filing deadlines were not
posted in the law school until Satur-
day, four days after they were posted
on the undergraduate campus.

All candidates were also against a
separate judicial system for the law
school. Junior Brandt Wood, can-
didate for president said law students
‘would lose a valuable sense of tradi-
tion and unity.”

Chris deMovellan, candidate for
vice president, said law students
“protect the innocence of the accused
more than the undergraduates can
do.”

“‘T would see that as a last resort,”
said sophomore Valerie Pierson, a
candidate for secretary.

The Candidates did acknowledge
that law students do have greater
knowledge of trial porcedures.

In discussing the transition from
coeducation, most of the candidates
thought the transition was going well.
The lone dissenter was presidential
candidate Rick Robins.

“TI believe in the long run the
university has been raped. They (the
administration) are trying to na-
tionalize the university,’’ he said.

By Perry S. Hayes/The Ring-tum Phi

The candidates for president were
asked in a question from the floor
about the ‘“‘micromanagement of stu-
dent affairs by John Wilson.’’ When
one candidate asked for a clarifica-
tion, senior E.C. representative An-
drew Caruthers said, ‘What beefs do
you have with Dacron John?”
Caruthers did not ask the original
question.

Wood said he sees Wilson focusing
on outward issues instead of internal-
ly and that it would be beneficial if he
made a study of the school’s
historical perspective.

Robins went one step further.
“Wilson and his team of bureaucrats
have gone a bit too far,” he said.

Another question from the floor
was addressed to the vice presiden-
tial candidates. They were asked if
the Students Activities Board’s funds
should be limited or changes because
of recent losses.

pledge activities or labor before the
program is restarted)

The pledge program cannot
restart until a new pledge program
for the rest of this year is presented
and approved by the IFC judicial
board

*KA must present a new pledge
program for future pledge classes
that has been approved by their na-
tional fraternity

*KA pledge classes will be on con-
duct probation through June of 1988

The entire KA house in on conduct
probation through the rest of winter
term

eThe KA pledge class must do a
public service project which will re-
quire the pledges to go to all the
fraternity houses and offer to return
other items accumulated on scaven-
ger hunts.

According to Atkins, the pledge
who was arrested for trying to steal a
license plate was drunk and acted on
his own because the license plate was
not on the list of things for the
pledges to obtain. No charges were
filed against the student and he was
released the next morning.

Atkins said a flag was stolen by a
student who was drunk and acting on
his own initiative. ‘Neither the flag
nor the license plate were on the list
the brothers had given the pledges.
They were both acting on their own.

But I know the flag has been return-
ed,” he said.

IFC President Chris Saxman said
that the judicial board only punished
KA for the scavenger hunt and not
the acts that took place during the
hunt. He also pointed out that any
scavenger hunts that take place out-
side the city limits of Lexington are
strictly forbidden by the IFC by-
laws.

Because the license plate and flag
incidents may involve the honor
system and due to the confidential
nature of Executive Committee in-
vestigations and proceedings, none of
the members of the Executive Com-
mittee could comment on the situa-
tion.

The Executive Committee did
clarify its position on scavenger
hunts, stating that items taken on
such hunts without permission or be-
ing paid for will be investigated as
honor offenses.

When asked why the pledges were
being punished for something the
brothers told them to do, Atkins said,
‘‘When there is a pledge program we
hand down punishments affecting the
pledge program. When there are
social problems we hand down
punishments affecting social ac-
tivities. Pledge probation has a
marked effect on the fraternity.”

NCAA clears policy
on 12-12-6 terms

 

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Assignments Editor

 

Barring a communications mixup,
Washington and Lee’s dispute with
the National Collegiate Athletic
Association concerning the eligibility
of W&L football running back Chris
Coffland is over.

The NCAA Academic Require-
ments Committee decided this week
that W&L students must take a
minimum of 10 academic credits in
the fall term, 10 in the winter and
three in the spring to be eligible to
participate in intercollegiate
athletics, according to W&L
Registrar Scott Dittman and W&L
Athletic Director William D.
McHenry.

Student athletes also must take at
least 24 total credits during the
school year, the two said.

McHenry was told by an NCAA
representative Wednesday night that
because of the calendar ruling, the
case against Coffland had been drop-
ped. Coffland was declared ineligible
for the last two games of the 1986
football season after the NCAA learn-
ed he was taking 10 credits.

He had faced the possibility of sit-
ting out between two and seven
games in 1987.

“Coffland is okay,’’ McHenry said
Wednesday night. ‘‘It’s been a long,
hard fight, but we finally won it.”

But McHenry stressed that he
wanted to receive written confirma-
tion of both decisions before he would
truly consider the fight won. Dittman
expressed similar sentiments.

Coffland, a junior from Baltimore,
was declared ineligible by the NCAA
in early November because he was
not registered for 12 credits during
the fall term. He could not be reached
for comment Wednesday night.

Immediately following the surprise
ruling, McHenry had asked all W&L
coaches to make sure their athletes
were taking 12 academic credits each
term. Wrestling co-captain Jeff Maz-
za, a senior from Bayshore, N.Y.,

was not allowed to wrestle for W&L
during the fall term because he was
taking an underload, McHenry said.

 

 

 

 

 

Chris Coffland

Mazza now is taking a full academic
load and wrestled the entire winter.

Mazza was the only other athlete
directly affected by the Coffland
decision, which was immediately ap-
pealed by W&L.

The dispute focused on W&L’s non-
traditional academic calendar,
which consists of two terms lasting 12
weeks and a six-week spring term.
Because of the calendar, W&L
students take fewer credit-hours per
term than students at other schools.

NCAA bylaw 5-1-C requires that a
student-athlete be registered in a
minimum of 12 semester or quarter
hours, “or a similar minimum
academic load as determined by the
NCAA Eligibility Committee in an in-
stitution that determines registration
other than on a traditional semester
or quarter-hour basis or conducts a
cooperative educational program.”’

A normal academic load at W&L is
12 to 14 credits, inclusive, per 12-
week term. Any amount below that is
considered an underload.

Students must be taking nine credit
hours per term in the fall and winter
terms to compete in intercollegiate
athletics for W&L, according to the
current university catalog. Coffland
was enrolled in 10 credits, but the
NCAA applied its 12-hour require-
ment to his fall term and ruled him
ineligible.

Finance club will appeal to a broad range of students

By TOM BRICKEL
Staff Reporter

 

Finance is probably the single
most popular field among Wash-
ington and Lee graduates entering in-
to a career, says Joseph Goldsten,
professor of administration at W&L.

Given this interest in finance
among business and nonbusiness ma-
jors alike, a student organization is
being formed which will orient

students toward practical and prag-
matic applications of finance. Called
the Washington and Lee student
chapter of the Financial Man-
agement Association (FMA), the
chapter will have its first meeting
Thursday, March 12, at 4:00 in Com-
merce School room 221.

According to Goldsten, advisor for
the group, students interested in the
field of finance need not be business
majors to be a part of the student-run
organization. ‘‘Interest and enthus-
iasm, not experience, are the only re-
quirements for getting involved,”
says Goldsten. ‘Students who have

taken courses in finance will find that
the organization tends to augment
their classroom experience.
However, everyone is encouraged to
participate.”

The FMA is a professional organ-
ization of financial executives,
analysts, professors, and students
who live and work in cities through-
out the world. FMA is also the only
finance association which has been
successful in bringing students, pro-
fessors, and practitioners of finance
together for their mutual benefit.

“It is a pragmatically-oriented
society which offers students an op-

portunity to begin their professional
development while they are still in
school,” said Goldsten. ‘Through
membership in FMA, they will be ex-
posed on a personal basis to the peo-
ple who can offer much practical ad-
vice and insight into the field of
finance.”

Students joining the organization
will receive publications from FMA,
such as a “Careers in Finance’
booklet, and ‘Financial Manage-
ment,”’ a journal allowing students to
keep abreast of the latest issues in
finance.

In addition, FMA honors outstand-

ing students in finance through the
established FMA National Honor
Society, the only national honorary
which specifically recognizes out-
standing achievement in finance.

“As this will be a student-run
organization, the possibilities for this
organization are almost limitless,”
Goldsten said. ‘From sponsoring
speakers and talking to them on a
one-to-one basis, to pursuing projects
related to finance, students will be
able to pursue the field in whatever
direction their interest takes them,”
he added.
 

 

 

 

 

OPINION

 

Security

The doors to women’s sections of the dorms are now locked
from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m., a policy taking effect last Friday
night. The new policy is being implemented because of
several serious incidents in the freshman dorms involving in-
dividuals outside of the W&L community.

All the incidents have involved non-university men. The
men have stolen items from the dorms, and, in one case,
harassed a young freshman woman. The majority of these in-
cidents have occured in the women’s sections of the dorms.

There are several drawbacks to the change in rules. While
visitation hours remain the same (if the hall has 24 hour
visitation, men still are allowed on the hall at all times),
women will have to let all visitors into their sections. Spon-
taneous visits will no longer be possible, and freshmen must

now carry their keys with them. Dorm counselors must make
sure that the doors are locked and unlocked at the designated

times. If a dorm lounge is accessed from the women’s sec-
tions, students who don’t live in that section will have a hard
time using the lounge after 11 p.m.

While these drawbacks are unfortunate, there doesn’t ap-
pear to be any alternative. W&L has been lucky that
something more serious hasn’t happened before now. ‘‘Crime
is 95 percent opportunity and 5 percent incentive,” according
to Assistant Proctor Burr Datz. And W&L’s honor code that
gives us so much freedom also gives criminals plenty of op-
portunity.

It is unfortunate that circumstances make it necessary to
lock doors to women’s sections. Hopefully, the student body
will soon grow used to carrying their keys and calling ahead
before dropping in on a female freshman friend. Surely, it’s a
small thing to do to insure the safety of fellow W&L students.
Unless, of course, someone can think of an alternative...

The vote

“The Big Three’’ election is coming up soon. It’s the
responsibility of the students of Washington and Lee to
familiarize themselves with the candidates.

The Executive Committee holds enormous power on this
campus. Not only does the Committee investigate and try all
possible honor violations, they control many aspects of stu-
dent organizations and activities. Obviously, the students
who serve on the committee must be well qualified and con-
cientious.

There was a session Wednesday afternoon in the C-school
that gave students a chance to ask questions of all the can-
didates. The session was not very well attended, considering
the size of the student body. The session was moved from its
originally annouced location. Perhaps this has something to
do with the attendance, or the lack thereof.

Looking back, we see how much can change during a year.
It is important that our student leaders genuinely reflect stu-
dent views. In order to select the candidate that does best

represent student opinion, the voters must make an informed
decision.

We urge you to find out about the candidates. If you don’t
know any of the candidates, find out who they are. Find out
about what they think about fraternities, coeducation, the ex-
panding university size and the myriad of issues that affect
students at W&L. The people we elect will not only judge
honor trials or decide how much money each student
organization will receive, they will represent W&L and its
students’ opinions throughout the year.

MY VIEW
By MARK FARLEY

 

This past Monday evening, I at-
tended the organizational meeting of
the Minority Recruitment Commit-
tee (MRC). Since I am co-chairman
of the Student Recruitment Commit-
tee and play a role in the admissions
process, I wanted to find out what the
MRC and its members were setting
out to accomplish. The time was well
spent.

First, the founders of the MRC are
to be applauded. Unlike some of their
peers, they are seeking to play an ac-
tive, rather than a passive role in the
life of this institution. They have
identified what they see as problems
at Washington and Lee and are set-
ting out to correct them. The in-
itiative of the founders as well as the
initiative of those who attended the
meeting is commendable.

Second, the founders of the MRC
are correct. Washington and Lee
needs to examine the life of its
minority students and analyze the
University’s recruitment of
minorities. The MRC should consider
these subjects and look at how
minority life at W&L is perceived by
prospective students. The committee
should then make a determination on
how Washington and Lee could be
made more attractive to minority
students.

These should be the Minority
Recruitment Committees’s main
goals. While the MRC can and will be
encouraged to assist the Admissions
Office by acting as a support group
for the Student Recruitment Com-
mittee, the formal process of giving
tours and hosting prospective
students is best left in the hands of

2

Minorities needed —

 

Instead, the MRC should be respon-
sible for accentuating the positive
aspects of Washington and Lee. This
can be done on a personal level by
talking with the prospective minority
students or by revising current Ad-
missions Office publications that
deal with minorities.

In addition, after specific problems
have been identified, the Minority
Recruitment Committe should work
in conjunction with the Office of the
Dean of Students, specifically the
Dean of Minority Affairs, as well as

other student organizations (the '

Minority Student Association, for ex-
ample), in order to resolve these pro-
blems.

More likely than not, any resolu- |

tion to racial or similiar problems at

Washington and Lee will have to oc- ‘

cur through the education of the stu-
dent body and the community as a
whole. This is the real challenge.
The process of education, as in all
cases, will be difficult. People resist

all types of change, but they especial- :

ly resist the types that involve their

having to alter their perception and —

biases of other people. It is hard to
change a person’s attitude about
someone or something

when they

have held that view for most of their «

life. Often, this ingrained and tightly

held perception is what makes it dif- |
ficult for some people to interact |

minority students.

Yet this is exactly what the Minori-
ty Recruitment Committee and, in
fact, all of Washington and Lee must
set out to address and eventually
resolve. As members of the Universi-
ty community we should have a
definite interest in Washington and
Lee’s recruitment of minority
students; not only because it will bet-
ter our institution, but because it is

our responsibility as men and '

women.

Student says it does and will happen to us —

To the Editors:

With the tragedy of Daniel Martin’s death a
few weeks ago so vivid in our minds, it seems
somewhat redundant to be writing about the
brief instant in which all our lives can end.

One would think that Martin’s death would suf-
fice to give notice that our Washington and Lee
community does not exclude us from the reality
of the outside world. There were many who
hoped that Martin’s death make people stop and
think about how easily it can all end,

I, for one, was among those who had that invin-
cible attitude upon hearing of Martin’s death.
“Tt’ll never happen to me,”’ I said. I was right.

When I wrecked last week, I only got a concus-
sion and some stitches in my face. While lying in
a hospital bed in Roanoke a lot of things can go
running through your head. But after getting
over the shock, I began to wonder why I did not
think I could die.

I’m not sure there is an easy answer, but I
think the invincible attitude might be something
omnipresent among 18 to 22-year-olds. Look at
the lives we live. By attending one of the finest
universties to be found, we are afforded the in-
valuable opportunity to expand our minds in an
atmosphere of which most anyone would be en-
vious.

The thing is, we don’t need to do anything to en-
joy the W&L experience, or the college exper-
ience in general. Nothing except take care of
ourselves so we are alive to participate in it. It is
ours for the taking.

Because of this, we tend to get caught up in our
own little world here in Lexington and forget that
being here is the same as being anywhere else
when it comes to being in a car accident, or any
other accident. This attitude pervades us so
much, that even when someone dies, we don’t
really take it for what it is. A tragedy like that is
so foreign to us in our W&L environment we just
have a difficult time applying it to ourselves.
Hence, ‘‘It’ll never happen to me.”

This letter isn’t meant to be an exposé on the
way to live. I know some will read it and forget
about it. But, I hope others will see themselves
driving down the same road of reality that all of
us are; coming to this conclusion by reading this
letter or by Martin’s death instead of having to
have an accident of their own to open their eyes.
No one has their own special, accident-free
highway of life. And that is not to say that
mishaps or accidents are down the road for
everyone. Rather, I hope people realize, like I

did, that saying “‘It’ll never happen to me”

doesn’t mean a damn thing.
Simon Perez ’88

Those young men who grace Colonnade Halls,

End of the ‘one line’ war?

To the Editors:

This year I have really enjoyed the intense
waging of wits, the cutting insights, the high
moral standards, and the well thought out and
defensible arguments that have been going into
the letters to the editor lately concering co-
education. I can’t believe that the war between
the ‘one line women’ and the snappy comeback
by another student made the editor’s page. Why
don’t we just give them crayons and let them
send coloring book pictures to the Phi? It would
be more colorful and they would not have to
spend so much time thinking up the brilliant
thoughts that characterize this useless running

war.

Junior dislikes new system

To the Editors:

I thank God for the new registration pro-
cedures: not because I approve, but because this
issue has aroused student opprobrium against
the administration. Although I have nothing but
respect for the registrar, I believe the new policy
is totally abhorrent to all the traditions of
Washington and Lee: it rewards classes on the
basis of luck rather than merit or forethought.

Under the old system, students wishing to
register for popular classes with an enrollment
limitation had to exhibit enough concern to see
the appropriate professor well in advance of
registration day. Now, the early bird only gets
the worm if he happens to be a senior.

The new system has already succeeded in clos-
ing freshmen out of many classes, and because
most require prerequisites, it can be difficult to
complete any schedule, let alone one that in-
terests the student. The administration seems
determined, as also shown in the excessively
severe General Educational Requirements, to
force students into classes in which they have no
interest.

Interest should be the primary factor in class
selection, especially in the student’s major area.
One student taking a course because nothing else
is offered should not be allowed to block out a
major, simply because the older student was in
line first.

These problems already exist, yet other, more
serious effects of this irresponsible policy can be
projected. As freshmen find it impossible to
schedule basic-level courses they need for the
General Education Requirements, more and
more courses will be reserved for them. This, in
turn, will require completion of the G.E.R. early,
because key courses will not be open to up-
perclassmen. Where will this leave double ma-
jors and business majors who often have to
spread out the distribution over four years in
order to take necessary courses in the major? As
soon as a freshmen enters Washington and Lee,
he will have to schedule his entire four years
here. There will be no room for error. There will
be no time for re-consideration of the major.
There will be fewer and fewer student freedoms,
as they fade in the shadow of the computer.

If this description sounds more like Penn State
than Washington and Lee, unfortunately, this is
no accident. The administration, through vastly
increased numbers of students in each suc-
ceeding class year, a tyrannical General Educa-
tion Requirement system, and greater emphasis
on publishing than teaching, is attempting to
alter the basic fabric of this school. As the years
go by, Washington and Lee will come to resem-
ble a huge, impersonal University more and
more if the present administration is allowed to
continue unchecked. We must resist this subver-
sion at every step, or the Washington and Lee we
know as a unique bastion of tradition and wisdom
will surely cease to exist.

Washington and Lee has no
plans to exceed the 1500-student
limit established by the Board of
Trustees in 1984.

Frank Parsons, assistant to
University President John D.
Wilson, said no plan exists to ex-
ceed that limit, and that should
such a plan be proposed, it would
be opposed by some members of
the board.

Recently, there has been
speculation among students that
the University would exceed 1500
undergraduates if it enrolls 420
freshmen in each of the coming
four years. But Dean of the Col-
lege John W. Elrod said simply
multiplying original class en-
rollments by four doesn’t give an

A figure which does take this in-
to account is the attrition rate,
which gives the percentage of the
originally enrolled freshmen who
have left the University. Using
figures supplied by the 1986-87
Washington and Lee University
Fact Book, the Ring-tum Phi took
the Fall Term enrollments from
the classes 1972-86 in each of their
years, freshmen through senior.
Each of these figures was then
taken as a percentage of their
original Fall Term freshman
enrollment; from each of these
percentages, an average class
enrollment percentage was deriv-

Greenpeace
More than a whale story

By MATHEW HORRIDGE
Staff Reporter

 

John C, Cook, whose work with the
Greenpeace organization has taken
him from Siberia to the Amazon
Basin, spoke to 150 people last Thurs-
day night in Lee Chapel.

Cook’s lecture centered on the en-
vironment protection group’s efforts
to clean up the world’s ecology. He
said Greenpeace has four major
areas of concentration: ecology
preservation, toxic waste clean-up,
nuclear waste clean-up, and the
preservation of marine animals,
especially whales.

He said it was time for the people of
the world to start thinking about their
interaction with the environment
before it is permanently damaged.

“The world really has to come to
terms with itself,’ he said. “The
geography doesn’t recognize any
political or social differences” be-
tween nations.

The Global Change Board is “try-
ing to predict the long-range changes
of the world”’ so that people can act
accordingly.

The Global Change Board is an in-
ternational organization made up of
scientists, scholars and environmen-
tal experts, Cook said.

Cook said that one of Greenpeace’s
major projects in the next few years
will be to stop the deforestation of the
tropical rain forests, a problem
especially bad in Central and South
America.

Greenpeace’s efforts to curb toxic-
waste dumping have been fairly suc-
cessful, Cook said.

The group’s members favorite tac-
tic for stopping companies from
dumping toxic waste into the en-
vironment is to block the end of the
pipes that carry the waste.

Cook said at one company that was
polluting the air with smoke, a
Greenpeace member parachuted
from a 400-foot smokestack. He said
the action drew the attention of the
local media and put pressure on that

average enrollment percentages,..
multiplied- by. an original Fresh-.,
man enrollment, would give a=»
“valid” total Fall Term enroll-
ment for each class. Using a
freshman enrollment figure of 420
students and totalling the final
class figures, this method pro-
duces a total Fall Term student
population of 1499.

Associate Director of Admis-
sions Daniel N. Murphy said the
University would seek to admit
approximately 420 freshmen in
Fall Term 1987, 290 men and 130
women. Each year, Murphy add-
ed, the Admissions Department
looks to attract the same number
of incoming students within a
general range.

Murphy said one consideration
for the number of freshmen the
university admits is the amount of
dormitory space available for
freshmen.

 

 

company to improve its waste-man-
agement system.

The media, he said, are Green-
peace’s greatest tool.

Greenpeace is opposed to nuclear
weapons, Cook said, not because of
ideology so much as the recognition
that weapons tests and deployment
hurt the environment as does the
disposal of spent fuels.

In 1985, the Greenpeace ship, the
Rainbow Warrior, was sunk by
French demolition experts, after the
group announced it would block a
French nuclear weapons test in the
South Pacific.

That incident brought Greenpeace
a lot of attention, and many people in
the audience asked about the event.

Cook said Greenpeace was disap-
pointed by the decision of the United
States not to continue the morator-
ium against nuclear weapons testing.

“The United States lost a real op-
portunity (to curb nuclear prolifera-
tion) on Feb. 3 of this year’’ when it
proceeded with a weapons test, Cook
said. The Soviet Union extended its
moratorium on weapons test three
times but, after Feb. 3, said it would
also resume tests.

Greenpeace was successful in stop-
ping the dumping of nuclear waste in-
to the Atlantic Ocean by appealing to
the dock workers of Europe not to
load the barrels of waste on ships,
Cook said.

Previously, ships would take the
barrels out to sea and dump them
along the ship’s course to a point ap-
proximately 400 miles southwest of
the Spanish coast, he said. Green-
peace members tried to prevent
crews from dumping barrels by driv-
ing inflatable boats under the crane
derricks.

Cook said by doing this the
Greenpeace members were forcing
the ships’ crews to make a decision
about whether or not it would be
worth it to drop a drum of waste on
another human being.

Most people associate Greenpeace
with saving whales, Cook said, and
the group has made great strides in

saving many species, especially the
humpbacked whale.

Five major countries — the Soviet
Union, Japan, South Korea, Sweden
and Norway — still have commercial
whale hunts, but the Soviet Union has
promised to end its whaling by the
end of this year and Japan has pro-
mised to end its by the end of 1988,
Cook said.

Cook said Greenpeace currently is
working to establish a base camp on
Antarctica — what he calls the
world’s “last unclaimed territory”
— for scientific observations. He said
Antarctica accurately reflects what
changes are happening in the world
because much of the atmosphere
passes over the polar region.

Cook concluded his lecture by tell-
ing of his experience on a trip to
block Soviet whaling off the Siberian
coast.

As the crew suspected, there was a
whaling station on the coast that
mainly was used to process whale
meat for mink food. The high blubber
content of whale meat brings out the
shine in the mink’s coat.

After filming the whaling station,
several members of the team, in-
cluding Cook, decided to take small
boats to the coast to pass out anti-
whaling literature to the village’s
fishermen.

The team members were arrested
by Soviet authorities, an arrest
witnessed by those on the Green-
peace ship. The ship’s crew decided
to try to get the film to Canada by
putting it and a man in an inflatable
boat. The boat was captured by a
Soviet helicopter, however, and the
crew thought the film was destroyed.

The dinghy crossed the ship’s path
about an hour later with the film still
aboard. Cook and his fellow pro-
testors were held for a week and then
released.

Cook’s lecture was sponsored by
Contact, a student committee that
brings speakers of national pro-
minence to the Washington and Lee
campus. Contact is funded by the In-
terfraternity Council and the Ex-
ecutive Committee.

More than 50 representatives from
Washington and Lee, Virginia Mil-
itary Institute and the Lexington
community have been invited to at-
tend a “town conversation’’ at the
University Center on Wednesday
afternoon.

The meeting, which will last from 4
p.m. to 7:30 p.m., is sponsored by
Kathekon, W&L’s  student-alumni

Minority recruitment meeting successful

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Assignments Editor

Providing housing for prospective
minority students and establishing
an alumni network were two of the
main goals expressed Monday night
by the organizers of a minority
recruitment group at Washington
and Lee.

“The main thing we want is diver-
sity,’ said Dana J. Bolden, a black
sophomore from Boyton Beach, F'la.,
at the group’s initial meeting. ‘Our
goal is not just to recruit black peo-

ple,” he said, noting the small
number of Hispanic and Jewish
students at W&L.

About 15 students, mostly white, at-
tended the hour-long meeting. Bolden
and co-organizer Thomas B. Brickel,
a white sophomore from Brentwood,
N.Y., discussed their goals and then
answered questions.

Brickel said he was pleased by both
the turnout and the discussion.

Two of those in attendance were
junior Mark L. Farley, who will chair
the Student Recruitment Committee
next year, and Assistant Director of
Admissions Mimi Milner Elrod.

Robinson speaks
on everyone’s fears

 

By MARGARET PIMBLETT
Staff Reporter

The fear of change prevents people
from developing and accepting new
ideas, said a nationally-known televi-
sion journalist last Thursday night.

Max Robinson, formerly a tri-
anchor for ABC’s World News
Tonight, spoke in duPont Audi-
torium. His visit was sponsored by
the Washington and Lee Minority
Student Association in honor of Black
History Month.

“We fear change, we fear same-
ness, we fear white people, we fear
black people, we fear women, we
fear men, we fear alphas, we fear
deltas,’’ said Robinson.

“We fear the past and have a
prayer of the future, and little taste
for the present.”

Robinson said that the past is fear-
some because Americans ‘‘have fail-
ed to understand their history.”’

He also said that the term ‘‘black
history’ does a disservice to blacks

heranece it kaanc them cenarate fram

whites, as though blacks were not
part of regular American history, but
instead must be treated as a different
entity.

Rather than deliver a prepared
speeck, Robinson spoke extempor-
aneously and answered questions
about topics ranging from self-love to
the Iran contra scandal to journalism
ethics.

He said that he used to have a pro-
blem with self-love, the ability to like
himself without conceit while ac-
knowledging his good traits.

“Self-love has one mortal enemy
—fear,’’ he said.

“The reason we have so much se-
parateness in this country is because
we fear each other.”

Robinson said that too many people
allow themselves to wear masks that
disguise their true identity, because
they do not love that identity

When asked about the Iran situa-
tion, he referred to it as ‘“‘Irangate,”’
but during later questioning admit-
ted that he had spoken hastily.

“It’s catchy,’ he said, which is
whw he thinks the term has been used

Farley and Elrod both stressed to
those in attendance that they should
consider applying for the Student
Recruitment Committee. But the two
also said in interviews that they
thought the minority recruitment
committee could be viable and im-
portant organization.

One of the group’s major jobs may
be to help increase the number of ap-
plications from minorities.

Elrod said that 53 minority stu-
dents applied to W&L last year.
Thirty-five were accepted, and six
enrolled. Farley suggested that the

notations.

He said the situation “is a major

that true scenarios can be good.
“Either the president does not make

of government, or he does — and

and that it work to change that situa-
tion.

Farley said that the Student
Recruitment Committee would con-
tinue to handle all tours and
transportation, but that the minority
recruitment group could provide
housing and other assistance.

Elrod, who said she attended
because she was asked to do so by
students, stressed that the minority
recruitment group had no direct ties
to the admissions department.

“It is not part of the admissions of-
fice,’ she said. ‘‘It is student-run.”’

The problems with media coverage

because journalists tend to group and
attempt to show up their colleagues
on particular topics, while overlook-
ing other important stories.

by Joseph King, who took over as
Lexington’s city manager during the
summer. King wanted to know if
there was a precedent for such a
meeting, which there was.

The goal of the meeting is to ‘‘open
communications between the three
important constituencies in our com-
munity,” said Farrar, who would like
to see such gatherings held on an an-
nual or semi-annual basis.

The representatives will be en-
couraged to share ideas, concerns,
interestes and perceptions, Farrar
said. ‘‘We want it to be positive and
constructive.”

Farrar said he hoped the meeting
would promote understanding and
cooperations between the three
groups.

About 25 people have been invited
from W&L. Fifteen have been invited
from VMI, as well as 15 from the
community. The W&L representa-
tives include a number of deans, stu-
dent government members, student
media editors, and heads of
undergraduate and law school
organizations.

Many of the W&L representatives
are seniors because the heads of
clubs and organizations have not yet
been chosen. Farrar said he was
aware of this, but he wanted to hold
the meeting before spring term,
when W&L tends to be fragmented
because of the large number of
students who are off campus.

“This is an agenda-setting
meeting,’ he said. A _ follow-up
meeting likely will be held in the fall.

He said to the prospective jour-

would have to understand you would

Big Three officers speak on their duties

By BRAND ORGN
Vice President of the Executive
Committee

At this time, most students are fos-
mulating plans for Fancy Dress or
are desperately trying to finish up
papers and tests so they can make
the most of the weekend. Every stu-
dent should also be thinking about the
Big Three elections this coming Mon-
day.

In electing a vice president, keep in
mind that he is the treasurer of stu-
dent body funds and plays a crucial
role in determining how much each
organization receives. Through
scheduled budget hearings, the vice
president keeps a careful eye on how
each club spends its funds.

Another duty of the vice president
is serving as technical advisor to the
accused during an honor trial. He
answers questions about procedure
and accompanies the president when
he imforms a student that he has
been charged with a possible honor
violation.

The person you elect must be able
to work with peers, faculty, ad-
ministrators and alumni in a mature,

 

 

 

 

 

consuming job, especially during
honor proceedings when school work
takes a back seat to that of the Ex-
ecutive Committee.

Prior experience is not necessary,
but the vice president must be com-
mitted to the ideals of honor and
tradition at Washington and Lee. Be-
ing the second-highest student
government post on campus, it is not
a position to be taken lightly.

Serving as vice president has been
a rewarding experience. In closing, I
ask that you take time to look at the
candidates to determine who is best
qualified for the office considering
the statements made above.

Vote wisely!

| Robins: self-described man with a mission

By SEAN BUGG
Editor

 

Junior Rick Robins is running a
potentially controversial campaign
for president of the Executive Com-
mittee. The campaign concerns itself
with the “loss of the W&L gentle-
man’”’ since coeducation and the ad-
ministration’s deepening involve-
ment in student affairs.

“T’m dead serious when I say that I
feel the power needs to be shifted
toward the student body and away
from John Wilson and his bureau-
crats.”’

Robins thinks that the advent of

coeducation has brought an end to
the Washington and Lee gentleman.
He said this has resulted ‘‘not direct-
ly from coeducation, but the new type
of student which coeducation has at-
tracted. r

“The women may not favor it, but I
think that having been here for a
year or half-year, they will under-
stand and respect that viewpoint if
they are at all sensitive to the view-
point here,” said Robins.

Wood builds
honor platform

By JOHN PENSEC
News Editor

Brandt Wood doesn’t have one
specific reason why he is running for
president of the student body; he has
many, all joined by his committment
to the Honor System and confidence
in himself.

After two years on the Executive
Committee, Wood says he under-
stands what the duties of the presi-
dent are. He has had, he says, good
role models during his years on the
committee.

It is those years that have given
this junior, business administration
major a better understanding and ap-
preciation of the Honor System, a
system he is eager to support as
president. Prior E.C. experience is
necessary, in his opinion, because of
the exposure to trial and meeting
procedures that it affords.

In talking about the law school and
recent questioning of its relationship
with the undergraduate campus,
Wood says he thinks it would be a
mistake for there to be two separate
judicial systems. Two systems, he
says, would divide the schools, and
unity among the student body is im-
portant to Wood. He views the Honor
System as the most important link
between the two schools.

Law students, he says, are an in-
tegral part of the E.C. because of
their knowledge of certain pro-
cedures.

But unity is not the only thing of im-
portance to Wood. The single sanc-
tion is equally important.

“T would address all student con-
cerns with open discussions, but I
believe the privileges and freedoms
we enjoy would be in jeopardy with-
out the single sanction,”’ he said.

“If there were degrees of sanc-
tions, then trust would be in degrees.
Trust can not be measured by
degree. You either trust someone or
you don’t.’’

As president, Wood says he will be
committed to educating new students
to the facets of the Honor System and
to maintaining an awareness among
other students of why they are ac-
corded such freedoms.

“T believe I can help the Honor
System maintain its goals of strong
student support and unity within the
entire student body,” he said.

said, ‘‘He, like Wilson, has a habit of
taking the easy way out when con-
fronted with controversial issues. In-
stead of turning to constructive
educational methods to correct pro-

and regulations.”

Robins believes that the frater-

Brad Root thinks his experience as
a member of the Executive Commit-

candidates for president of the stu-
dent body. The junior journalism ma-
jor from Erie, Pennsylvania is serv-
ing his second term as an E.C.
representative.

Root said that he has worked close-

“Don’t get me wrong,” he said.
‘I'm not trying to come away at all

the E.C. has “turned away” from the
issue in the pastpthough he noted the
recent E.C. letter to fraternities war-

a positive sign.

Robins has been an IFC represen-

He is a firm believer in the single
sanction and the Honor Systemas it
is now. To codify that system by:im-

different offenses would replace the
Honor System with a set of rules and
regulations. Root acknowledges that
the system is being questioned by
some students, especially in the law
school, but he thinks that to separate
the two schools by having different
honor systems “‘would be a crime in
itself.”

“We are all Washington and Lee

The candidates were in favor of fin-
ding new ways for the SAB to use its
money.

“The budget the SAB has to work
with is unique,” said Junior Pat
Schaffer. He said they are given
money to cover losses, losses due
primarily to purposeful low ticket
prices and changes in the drinking
age.

Mark Davis, a second year law stu-
dent running said when you see
losses ‘‘that’s the time to change
your policy.”

Some of the suggestions from the
candidates included working with
smaller bands and better scheduling
taking into account fraternity par-
ties.

The candidates were also asked if
they felt the jurisdiction of the Honor
System applied outside the W&L
community, such as students at
home, at women’s colleges or on
fraternity activities.

Junior Mark Chiappara, a can-
didate for secretary, addressed the
issue of pledge scavanger hunts say-
ing, “‘I think frats should be informed

of the position they put thier pledges
in.”

In regards to so-called ‘prank

secretary Tom O’Brien said, “the

E.C. has been unwilling in the past to
address the issue.” O’Brien noted
that the student generation deter-
mines honorable behavior and the
“E.C. is solely an interpretor...but
not an initiator.”’

All the candidates were asked what
they felt the state of the Honor
System was at W&L.

Normen Sigler, a junior candidate
for vice president, said, “The Honor
System has been strong...for hun-
dreds of years and it will continue to
be strong.”

Greg Dale, a sophomore candidate
for secretary, said the Honor System
“is going fairly well.’’ However, he
feels that there is a problem in that
“People just look at it as though you
should not lie, cheat or steal.” In-
stead, Dale believes that students
should make the system a part of
their lives.

One question from the audience
was directed solely to secretary can-

didate Pierson. She was asked if she

felt that her candidacy will be viewed
by students as a lack of commitment.
Pierson currently is secretary for the
Mock Convention.

“T’ve heard a lot of people talking
about that,” Pierson said. She said
she met with the executive commit-
tee of the Convention and they gave
her their support.

“T don’t see it as an opportunistic
type of thing,” Pierson said. “I hope
it’s not viewed as that.”’

The office of secretary completes

Robins controversial platform is

“It is important that
undergraduates at Washington and
Lee realize that the law school is not
a separate entity from the under-
graduate school nor do its students
want to be,” said Mark Davis, a sec-

ond year law student running for vice
president of the student body.

Davis is a member of the Student
Bar Association, and is president of
his class. He said that as a member
of an honor subcommittee during his
undergraduate years at the Universi-

with the tradition of honor that has
been continued with his education at
W&L, as well as with the single sanc-
tion system.

Junior Norman Sigler is running
for vice president of the Executive

Lee, he has served on the Superdance
Committee and in high school was
the vice president of the Key Club,

E.C.

as intermediary

 

By TOM BRICKEL
Staff Reporter

Tom O’Brien, a junior politics ma-
jor from Cincinnati and candidate for
the position of secretary on the Ex-
ecutive Committee, stresses stu-
dent/administration relationships as
the most important issue facing the
E.C.

O’Brien, chairman of the Student
Telephone Union for two years and
member of Contact and the SAB,
says that in recent months, the rela-
tionship between the two bodies has
deteriorated “through a lack of
understanding on the part of both
parties.”

“The E.C. should serve as more of
an intermediary for both the student
body and the administration,”’
O’Brien said in an interview. “Its
success in effectively communi-
cating the viewpoint of the student
body is crucial to bettering the rela-
tionship between the two.”

O’Brien lists the enlargement of
the student body and the new
registration system as examples of
such miscommunication. “The stu-
dent body often feels it has lost its
voice in changes such as these. It is
the duty of the E.C. to relay student
input to the administration, and vice
versa, something where there is
always room for improvement.”’

‘“‘Many students didn’t know what
was going on with the registration
system, for example, causing them
many problems, like underclassmen
being unable to enroll in the classes
they wanted. Problems like these
could be ironed out by the E.C. com-
municating the changeover to the
students.”

Though it has come under fire in
the past, O’Brien lists the Honor
System as the strongest point of the
university. ‘“‘The need to instill the
belief in the Honor System in fresh-
men is still there. We are a unique
school in that the Honor Code re-

“Students at the law school see
more eye-to-eye with undergraduate
than they may think with regard to
the issues most important to the
University,’’ he said.

“Those students pushing for a
judicial enforcement system
separate from the E.C. in the law
school are part of a vocal minority
which have misrepresented the opi-
nion of the entire law school student
body.”

Davis thinks that the creation of
multiple sanctions to handle different
offenses is wrong because “it tells
people, from members of the com-
munity to future employers, that
Washington and Lee believes in
degrees of honor.”

“There can be no such thing as
degrees of honor within a system
such as ours. There is only one code,
and if anyone violates this, that per-
son does not deserve to be at this
school.”

Davis attributes the low number of
second year students believing in the
Honor System, as taken by a recent
survey, to the background of those
students, saying that most of the
schools from which they come have
“little or no working honor system.”’

“It has this factor, combined with
an E.C. orientation that could’ve
place more emphasis on the honor
code, that resulted in the low
number, and not a weakness in the
current Honor System,” he said.

Ultimately, Davis does not identify
himself solely as a law student, but
rather as “a member of the com-
munity of trust that envelopes
Washington and Lee.”

He added that ‘‘This community of
trust goes hand in hand with the
ethical consideration raised by the
Honor System. It is this bond that I
would hope to strengthen if elected to
the position of Executive Committee
vice presidert.”’

deMovellan ‘understands’

the budget and E.C. workings

Sophomre E.C. representative

Christopher deMovellan is running
for vice president of the Executive
Committee. Besides the experience
he has gained through representing
his class on this year’s committee,
deMovellan thinks that living on the
president of the E.C.’s hall last year
allowed him to “keep in touch with
the activities of the E.C.”’

By going over this year’s budget
with Vice President Brandt Surgner,
deMovellan has, in his opinion, been
able to “understand the format and
function of the budget and the time
commitments necessary for the posi-
tion of vice president.”’

deMovellan thinks ‘the Honor
System is doing very well,” and “‘the
E.C. needs to continue supporting the
same basic guidelines followed in the
past.” According to deMovellan
the Honor System ‘‘should be 100 per-
cent removed from the administra-
tion or faculty.’’ However, he added
that ‘the E.C. should work with the
faculty and they, in turn, should be
equally cooperative.’’ He is also in
favor of continuing the process of a
single sanction code. Commenting on
the concept of a student-run campus,
deMoveilan said, “‘the best way to
run a campus is to have the students
run it under the removed supervision
of the faculty.”” He added that he
while he thought all three candidates
were very qualified, in his opinion, he
is the “‘best of the three candidates.”’

mains strong after so many years.
The challenge facing the E.C. is to
ensure that it continues to work and
remain strong.”’

O’Brien admits that the school has
its weaknesses as well. ‘Besides the
lack of understanding between the
Hill and the students, there is a pro-
blem in the lack of closeness between
the law school and the undergraduate
school.”

“Where united effort is important
between the two schools, instead the
rift in the ravine has figuratively
widened. For example, the law
school has considered the option of its
own system of enforcing the Honor
System. While we are different
schools, we should remain one
university, something this option
overlooks.”

“In general,’ continued O’Brien,
“the students deserve an E.C. that is
not afraid to work for them. If elected
E.C. secretary, I hope to help the
E.C. achieve this end, encouraging
the administration to keep the
students in mind when making im-
portant decisions directly affecting
the entire student body.”’

 

Mark Chiappara, a junior account-
ing major from Upper Montclair,
New Jersey, and a candidate for the
position of Executive Committee
secretary, says that while many feel
the Honor System is in jeopardy,
qualitatively it continues to remain a
strong and effective part of Washing-
ton and Lee.

“People often measure the state of
the Honor System in terms of num-
bers — the number of honor violation
investigations and hearings, for ex-
ample,” said Chiappara at a forum
held for Big Three candidates yester-
day.
“But the efficiency of the Honor
System cannot be measured in this
manner. While there has been a
downward trend in the number of
honor violations, the strength of the
Honor System can be seen in the stu-

dent body’s adherence to it.”

Chiappara, a dorm counselor who
has participated on the diving and
rugby teams, says that the Honor
System is the most distinct charac-
teristic of Washington and Lee, and
has provided the motivation for him
torun for E.C. secretary.

“I would consider it an honor to
help continue and strengthen what
brought me to W&L; that is, the
Honor System. Having talked to cur-
rent members of the Executive Com-
mittee about the position of sec-
retary, I fully understand the duties
an am willing to put the time in that
would be required of the position.” -

Chiappara thinks that while E.C.
laws in the past with regard to the
jurisdiction of the honor code have
been liberal, that will no longer be
the case with future committees.
“Each case should continue to be
judged on its own individual merits;
however, students don’t realize how

serious the E.C. is about possible
honor violations, including those
pranks that in the past may have
been condoned.”’

Commenting on the possibility of
the creation of a separate judicial en-
forcement agency for the law school,
Chiappara stated that “there is no
reason for this.”

“The better the two schools are
able to act as a unified representa-
tion of Washington and Lee, the
stronger the Honor System will be, in
effect.”

The transition from an all-male
student body to a coeducated one was
one that “effected many positive
changes, though the extent of its
result remain to be seen,”’ he said.

“Academically and socially, the
school has improved, with women
becoming involved in all facets of the
university. But the results of coedu-

 

 

 

 

cation in the long run are hard to
determine. It will be interesting to
see if the unique identity the school
has had in the past will remain later.

The Honor System is both the
University’s greatest strength and its
greatest weakness, and something
that the Executive Committee must
continually work to improve, accord-
ing to Greg Dale, a sophomore from
Medina, New York, and a candidate
for the position of EC secretary.

Dale, an English and History ma-
jor who has served as executive
director of College Republicans and
both secretary and treasurer of the
Inter-varsity Christian Fellowship,
says that the most important role of
the EC is to see that the Honor
System is not forgotten.

Valerie Pierson understands there
are some real concerns facing the
E.C. in the next year. Those concerns
include the law school and its rela-
tionship to the Honor System as it is
now.

This sophomore, politics major
from Greensboro, North Carolina is
committed to the Honor System and
thinks she can address those issues.
That is why she is running for
secretary of the student body.

“There is a rift right now between
tae law school and undergraduates,”’
she said. “They (law students) are

not happy. I think the problem lies in
the procedural aspects of the honor
trial system. The solution is going to
depend on the law students.

“Tf they have such strong negative
feelings about the Honor System, it
must be a concern of the E.C.’s,”’ she
said.

Pierson served on the jury of a re-
cent honor trial. She credits that ex-
perience with bringing home how
much of a direct impact the system
has on the lives of W&L students. But
it is a system she believes in, and she
fully supports the single sanction.

Pierson thinks the administration
may have made too much of an effort
to help the women assimilate, and
she says she understands how the

Honor to be a way of

System and understand it, they are
able to appreciate it further.’

“In effect, the Honor System, often
considered the strongest point of the
university, becomes its weakest
point when people no longer under-
stand why they believe in it. It should
not be just a system, but a way of life
for those who do live within its
guidelines.”’

On the recent debate over the
merits of, coeducation, Dale says
that, while animosity will continue to
exist between those divided over the
issue, coeducation ‘‘has for the most
part been accepted by the student
body.

“Granted, people will continually
point to coeducation as a break with
tradition that hurt the university.
However, the move was a positive
one that in the long and short run will
only serve to strengthen the school.
Change does not necessarily mean
destruction of tradition, especially in
this case,” Dale commented.

Last year, the creation of the posi-
tions of female and minority ad hoc

members to the EC was suggested,
suggestions Dale says he under-
stands, but does not support. ‘‘The
EC was meant to represent the entire
student body, not just separate
groups within it. While the voice of
women and minorities must be heard
and presented by the EC, it would
enhance the unity the EC represents
if those students worked through the
system, instead of separating
themselves from it,” said Dale.

“The creation of ad hoc members
not only does this, but creates the ad-
ditional problem of setting a prece-
dent for groups within the student
body being guaranteed a position on
the EC. In the long run, these groups
will most likely be represented by the
existing executive committee.”’

Of particular importance, says
Dale, is the unity of both the law
school and the undergraduate school.
“There is a very real division be-
tween the two schools, one that is un-
fortunate when you think of the ad-
vantages both could derive in learn-
ing from each other,” said Dale.

people who don’t support coeducation
feel. But she said, “‘All you can do is
make the best of it.”

“They had good intentions that
were not well received by the
students,” she said. “It left the
women in a difficult position.”’

Pierson was recently appointed
secretary of the 1988 Mock
Democratic Convention. She said she
talked with others on the conven-
tion’s steering committee and that
they encouraged her torun.

All in all, however, this dorm
counselor and tennis player says she
is going into this with her eyes open.
“T think I can do a good job,” she
said. ‘I can only hope that everyone
will give me a chance.”

Right behind Murray was sophomore
James Ambrosini, who placed sec-

Aldridge said that John Burl-

Carder placing second at a height of
13’. Senior Matthew Steilberg was
third, also at 13’, and junior Joseph
Fisher finished sixth at 12’. The
Generals also took three of the top six
places in the high jump. Sophomore
Fray McCormick was second in that
event with a jump of 6'4’’. Steilberg
was fourth at 6’0’’, and John White
placed sixth at 5’10”’.

The Generals’ 400 meter relay
team of senior Kevin Weaver, John
White, Andy White, and Burlingame
ran in a slow heat, according to
Aldridge, but still finished in 45.6
seconds, nearly two seconds faster
than their previous best and good
enough for first place in that event.

W&L also took the gold medal in
the 3,200 meter relay, with Urso,
John White, and juniors Brandt Wood
and Edward Myers combining for a
time of 8:26.5, three seconds better

Lax lacks fourth quarter punch;
Wahoos winners once again

 

By DAVID EMRICH

The numbers one and three were
each doubly significant for the
Washington and Lee lacrosse team
last weekend. One because it was
their first game of the year and
because they were playing a Division
I team. Three because it was their in-
itial contest in Division III and
because they played Virginia closely
for three quarters before succumb-
ing by the final score of 16-9.

According to head coach Dennis
Daly, the General’s goal was to “‘lead
or be within striking distance after
three quarters.’ And he felt the
Generals had accomplished ‘that
goal.

After three quarters W&L trailed
by only three (11-8), and had actually
outscored the Cavaliers 3-2 in the
third period.

But the Generals couldn’t hold on
in the fourth quarter. W&L was play-
ing Virginia man to man on both of-

“We try to make it so that we have fun,” Stickley said, ‘‘At the same time
we want to win as much as we can. That’s why you play to win.

; For the past few years, the Washington and Lee baseball team has been in
a State of turmoil under the fiesty reign of former head coach Jim Murdock.
The Generals have suffered through five consecutive losing seasons,
finishing no better than fifth in the Old Dominion Athletic Conference. Jeff
Stickley wants to change all of that.

; ‘‘Stick’’, who has been coaching baseball as well as football off and on
since he was 17 years old, brings to the Generals a completely different
coaching style. Compared to the intense Murdock, Stickley, an assistant
football coach at W&L, is extremely calm and laid back. He attributes his
style to the many coaches he worked with and played under.

‘‘Lcoach the way I'd want to be coached,” he said. “‘I try to use the style of
people who have coached me and I’ve been lucky enough to have some good
nes.

“It depends too on the sport. Football is a more emotional sport and you
eally have to play on your emotions. Baseball is more of a sport where you
vant to keep an even keel because you play so many more games,” he said.

The monotony of practice is also one of Stickley’s major concerns. The last

hing he wants is for his players to start ‘‘dreading’’ practice and losing their
»nthusiasm for the sport.

As the head coach, Stickley is not afraid to admit fault. Then again, he is
not exactly willing to accept all the blame, either.

“I’m going to make mistakes. Everybody makes them. I’m going to do the
best I can and sometimes it’s going to make someone mad and they are not
going to like it. But, they are going to do some things to make me mad, so
we'll hang in there together.”

Stickley pointed out that the team’s main goal this season is to win the con-
ference. A winning season may be unattainable, said Stickley, due to the
caliber of the General’s nonleague opponents.

As for his assessment of the team at this stage of the season, Stickley was
pleased with all areas except the development of the pitchers. The lack of
practice time outside is the cause of this problem.

“Inside, you can throw off your wooden mounds and what you want,”’ he
said, ‘‘but it is a lot different outside.”

The squad’s attitude and work ethic has also been much to the coach’s lik-
ing.

“The attitude has been pretty good and I put a lot of stock into that,”
Stickley said. ‘‘I think we’ll surprise some people simply because a lot of
guys have a lot of experience and have played a lot. So we'll see.

The Generals play host to West Virginia Tech in a doubleheader on Satur-
day. Gametime is 1 p.m. at Smith Field.

fense and defense and appeared to
tire.

“We tried two different types of
defense,” said Daly, ‘“‘and they took
advantage of both.

“So we went to a defense that
would isolate their men, so Churchy
{senior goalie John Church] would
always know where the shots were
going to come from, since all the
other men would be covered.”

Daly continued, ‘‘We didn’t control
the ball well on offense, we would
bring it right down and score, and, of
course, that’s good.

“But because of that we were
spending a lot of time on defense and
our people began to get tired.’’

The Cavaliers put the game nearly
out of reach for the Generals when, in
a 52-second span early in the fourth
quarter, Virginia scored three goals.
W&L immediately called a time out
and appeared to have solved the pro-
blem, but it would have been nearly
impossible to catch up at that point.

“It was just a little break,’’ said
Daly of the time out. “‘A ‘thanks, I
needed that’ type of thing.

Jeff Stickley

“We just wanted to settle down and
play our type of game again.”

Junior midfielder Robbie Stanton
kept the Generals in the game early,
scoring three of W&L’s five first half
goals, and four of it’s first seven.

“Robbie just played a super
game,” said Daly.

Daly also said he was plesed with
the play of the entire defensive corps
in general and the outside defense-
men and midfielders in particular.
He said that he thought they did an
excellent job of controlling their men
one on one.

“Overall, we played well, and very
aggressively,”’ said Daly. ‘‘We were
going after the ground balls and we
played with the intensity we need-
ed.”’

Looking ahead, Fancy Dress Week-
end will bring a couple of firsts for
the Generals — their first game ever
against the Lynchburg varsity team,

as well as their first ever Old Domi-
nion Athletic Conference game.

Andrew White

By JOHN PACKETT
Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee tri-captain
Andrew White was named the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference In-
door Track Runner of the Year,
ee
Week.

“I felt really honored and sur-
prised by the whole event,” said
White.

White’s effort helped the
Generals win the team title at last
weekend’s ODAC Indoor Track
Championships at VMI.

The team thought the meet
would be a lot closer than their 48
point margin of victory, said
White.

White competed in the 55-meter
high hurdles, the 400-meter relay,
the 400-meter dash, and the 1600-
meter relay.

He won the 55-meter hurdles by
defeating John Williams of Lynch-
burg, who had beaten White
earlier in the year. White’s time of

7.9 seconds tied the conference in-

door record.

White placed second in the 400-
meter dash.

In the relays, he helped the
teams place first in the 400-meter
and third in the 1600-meter.

White has high hopes for his and
the team’s performances in the
upcoming outdoor season.

“Everyone on the team is work-
ing hard, and the younger runners
are coming along really well,”
said White.

“Trun a lot better in the outdoor
season because it is a longer
distance [in each lap] and it
makes it easier for me to gain
momentum.”

According to White, he needs to
cut two tenths of a second off his

outdoor time to become an all-

American.

White is an economics major
with a 3.72 GPA. He is a member
of Omicron Delta Kappa, an
honorary leadership fraternity.

Midler rescues ‘Fortune’

 

By MICHAEL TUGGLE
Movie Critic

 

With Bette Midler and Shelley
Long on the wings of the new comedy
Outrageous Fortune, one would expect
the film to take off. Instead, the film
rides up and down, ever threatening
to crash and burn with Midler acting
as its only salvation.

The story involves two “‘profes-
sional’ actresses. One is a serious
actress (Long) who knows every
great soliloquy ever written, while
the other (Midler) refers to
Shakespeare as ‘‘Bill’’ and wants to
know who the hell “‘Hamlet”’ is. Both
land into a two thousand dollar acting
seminar with one of the premier ac-
ting coaches in the world. O.K. Both
get involved with the same guy and
fall in love. O.K. One afternoon, the
guy walks into a building and Long
subsequently watches it explode.
Both lovers head for the mortuary,
where they confront each other for
the first time as love rivals. They
insist on identifying the body
and discover that (surprise!) the
doctors have the wrong body.

At this point, normal people return
to “‘life before the missing exploded
lover,’ but not these’ two.
They track him down at the airport
just as he is leaving and then fly all
over the country in an attempt to pin
him down When they eventually do

“You should see the dress I found,
it’s gorgeous...No, I don’t have a date
yet...I’ll get one, don’t worry! I’ve
still got a week left and I AM GOING
to Fancy Dress!”

Yes, it’s that time of the year again
— the famous ist-minute rush when
friends-of-friends and high school
boyfriends. are resurrected to escort
students to the biggest party of the
year — Fancy Dress. As the day
draws closer, standards lower — tall,
dark and handsome turns into some-
one who eats with utensils and bathes
regularly. Many people seem to think
of FD as a do-or-die affair — either

Getting a date for FD is on people’s
minds almost from Orientation week,
but the issue really heats up around
mid-January. Girls who hate parties
start dressing up and going out every
Wednesday, Friday and Saturday
night, sizing up every male they meet
according to availability and GQ quo-
tient.

What do women — from W&L and
surrounding colleges — think of FD?
One hears a variety of opinions.
From a student at a local women’s
college: “FD? Oh, you mean the
Fancy Dress Ball? Is that some time

catch up with him, he threatens to
kill them (a huge chafe, after spend-
ing thousands of dollars trying to find
him).

You see, Mr. Explosion, as weil as
the acting coach, are really Russian
spies, and they have managed to
steal a top secret serum from the
government by using the women as
carriers for messages. The re-
mainder of the film is spent in chase,
as the women pursue the KGB and
steal the serum back, and vice versa.

To make a long story short, this
film is not very intelligent and not
very funny. Pristine Shelley Long is a
good foil to Midler’s foul-mouthed
character, but she does tend to
overact. As for the KGB agents, they
don’t come close. John Schuck, who
you may remember from the sitcoms
of the 70’s, still can’t act and is still
not funny.

Last week’s Time magazine donned
Midler on the cover with the
headline, ‘You Bette!’’ The piece
reinstated what everyone else has
already realized: Bette Midler has
finally made the Big Time. She again
proves in Outrageous Fortune as she
did in her last two comedy hits, Down
and Out in Bevery Hills and Ruthless
People, that she is hilarious and has
the ability to make a movie work.

Little Saints big on talent

 

By MICHAEL TUGGLE
Entertainment Editor

 

While the Hoodoo Gurus may be
taking center stage in the small gym
of Doremus at Friday night’s Fancy
Dress Ball, you can be assured that
the warm up band, ‘‘the south’s
favorite’, Little Saints, will indeed
create some heat of their own. The
four year old band from Nashville,
Tennessee returns to Lexington Fri-
day night following a recent 50 week
tour to bring their mix of original and
cover music to the Fancy Dress ex-
travaganza.

The Little Saints quintet, Jeff
Holmes, Scot Evans, Randy Parsons,
Greg Eicnaugle, and Freeman
D’Angelo, has quite a varied repor-
toire, but one that always electrifies
the crows they play for. U2, Talking
Heads, and R.E.M. are the band’s
favorite and most heavily played
tunes, but other favorites like Spring-
steen, the Clash, the Violent Fem-
mes, and the Ramones are sure to
surface before the night is over. And
for the die hard Saints fans, not to
worry. With a Little Saints album set
for possible release this spring,

    

originals like ‘‘Girls Who Don’t Wear
Jewelry”, ‘‘Get Inside’, and “Great
Big Hands” will not be left aside.

For those of you that have never
seen Little Saints, let their reputation
precede them; they are crowd
pleasers. Their show is energetic,

No candidate received a clear ma-

Student |.D.s
not taken

By CHRISTIE CHAMPLIN
Staff Reporter

 

Recently there has been controver-
sy over what type of identification
students must show before being
allowed to purchase alcohol.

Last Wednesday, senior Thom
Randolph was not allowed to buy
alcohol in the GHQ because he could
prove his age only by showing his stu-
dent I.D. Randolph had not brought
his driver’s license so he was not
stamped as being of legal drinking

age.

RRandolph said that this had never
happened to him before. However, he
knew of ‘‘someone who went with his
student I.D. and had his hand
stamped as being old enough.’’ The
people who were working the door
said they could not accept just a stu-
dent I.D. They said they need a valid
driver’s license as proof of age.

“The ABC policy requires a valid
driver’s license as proof of age,”’ said

Glynn Alexander, chairman of the
Student Activities Board. ‘School
I.D.’s can be used as backup,” he ad-
ded. This driver’s license policy
“‘makes sure we can’t be held liable”
and prevents people who borrowed
I.D.’s from their friends from drink-
ing, noted Alexander. The people
working the door are not always sure
what other schools’ I.D.s look like.

Alexander said that the people
working the door that night probably
didn’t know Randolph. Alexander
said that if there is a question, ‘‘more
than likely if someone knows him he
will be let in.” He also said that
usually “if there is someone who I
have known for all four years and
have grown up with”’ he will be able
to drink. Alexander clarified the use
of the policy in both the pavilion and
the GHQ.

Dean Atkins said that the “law is
that the only acceptable ID for the
purposes of the ABC is a valid

Law editorial raises Honor System debate

By TOM BRICKEL
Staff Reporter

 

In 1984, the Washington and Lee
Student Bar Association presented a
referendum to law students asking
whether or not the law scnool should
establish its own judicial system to
enforce the Sehool’s Honor Code.
Three years latér, the question still
has not been answered.

In the February 19 Law News an
editorial entitled ‘“‘Does the E.C.
Uphold Fairness?” raised problems
with the White Book with regard to
the enforcement of the Honor Code,
as manifested in the Executive Com-
mittee. The provisions under ques-
tion in the editorial regard matters of
procedure which, according to the
editorial, ‘‘... may make a mockery of
the term justice unless they are
changed.”’

“By raising these particular
points, we hope to strengthen, not
weaken, the Honor Code,’’ said Don
Spratt, a third year law student and
editor-in-chief of the W&L Law News.
“The judicial code employed in the
current system in fact conflicts with
many of the things taught in law
school.

“The purpose of the editorial’s
criticism was to make the student
body’and the E.C. aware that pro-
blems do exist, and unless changed,
will possibly justify the creation of a
separate judicial system in accor-
dance with the Honor Code at the law
school.”

The Feb. 19 editorial criticized,
among other items, the provision
stating that if someone accused of an
honor violation fails to show up at a
closed hearing, the E.C. can decide
that person’s guilt or innocence in his
absence, which “violates the basic

right of the defendant to face his ac-
cusers,”’ according to the editorial.
In addition, it leaves the question of
who decides whether the accused’s
excuse for not appearing is
legitimate, open to discussion.

“A possible scenario is created
where the student could be convicted
in his absence. That student could
then bring the dismissal to a court of

law where the’ E.C.’s decision cotild *

be overturned. This would in effect
make the procedure in the White
Book illegal,’’ said Spratt.

The E.C., by virtue of the two-
thirds vote required to convict in
closed and open hearings, is unfair as
well, given the high burden of proof
on the defense to prevent a convic-
tion, according to the editorial. “A
system like that of the Student Con-
duct Committee (SCC), which re-
quires a three-fourths vote for con-
viction, may well provide more pro-

Honor society initiates

By MATHEW HORRIDGE
Staff Reporter

Twenty-four undergraduates and
one law student were initiated Tues-
day into Washington and Lee’s
chapter of Phi Beta Kappa at a con-
vocation at the University’s Lee
Chapel.

Phi Beta Kappa is a national honor
society for students with high grade-
point averages and good character.

Before listing this year’s inductees,
J. Brown Goehring, treasurer of the
Gamma of Virginia chapter, an-
nounced two award winners and two
new honorary members of the honor
society.

Steven F. Pockrass, a senior jour-
nalism major from Indianapolis, was
awarded the Pinney Prize. The Pin-
ney Prize was named after a former
professor, Edward L. Pinney, and is
voted upon by the Student Affairs
Committee.

James A. Sloat of Birdsboro, Pa.
was given the Phi Beta Kappa
Sophomore Award. This award is
given to the sophomore with the
highest grade-point average. Goeh-
ring said Gloat’s G.P.A. through four
terms is 4.194.

Minor L. Rogers, a professor of
religion at Washington and Lee, and
Thomas J. Pressley, a professor of

 

history at the University of Wash-
ington, who gave the convocation ad-
dress, were named honorary mem-
bers of the W&L chapter of Phi Beta
Kappa.

The seniors inducted were Jeffrey
P. Blomster of Emmaus, Pa.; Chris-
topher R. Carter of Chickasha,
Okla.; Eric D. Curren of Chicago;
Scott H. Gauvin of Cumberland, R.I;
Gerard R. Kehoe II of River Ridge,

Students of broadcast journalism

pronunciation.

“T had it in mind as a supplemen

he started writing the book on a sab

batical leave during the fall of 1984,
but had been researching and collec-

MacDonald joined the W&L faculty

tection because of the higher burden
of proof placed on the prosecution
and the more knowledgeable and ex-
perienced appeals board,’’ the
editorial stated.

The editorial went on to criticize
several other provisions of the White
Book, including the lack of rules used
to determine the admissibility of
evidence, and the relatively light
penalties ‘given to E.C. represen-
tatives and students representing the
accused for breaching the confiden-
tiality of the case. Both, says Spratt,
are examples of problems that
“when taken together, raise the
quesiton of whether the E.C. does an
adequate job of upholding fairness.’’

students if they were satisfied with

the respondents answered in the
positive, the Law News editorial

The unrest during the 1930s and
the years between 1965 and 1975
brought to the surface many
potential threats to the U.S. Con-
stitution but at the same time,
proved the strength of the docu-
ment, according to Thomas J.
Pressley, a history professor at
the University of Washington.

Pressley, speaking at Tuesday’s
Phi Beta Kappa convocation at
Washington and Lee’s Lee Chapel,
said the two decades showed how
the flexibility of the Constitution
helped avoid revolution.

During the 1930s, Pressley said,
people were concerned with the
worst economic situation in the
nation’s history. There was
“widespread fear and questioning
of what was to come.”’

There were many demonstra-
tions across the United States call-
ing for economic aid and political
reform, Pressley said. In addi-
tion, there were calls for revolu-
tion, from both the ‘‘Marxist left”
and the ‘‘authoritarian right.”’

 

Pe eee ea re are

be made between the code and the
judicial system enforcing it.”

“There is always the possibility of
the creation of a separate judicial
system for the law school, as the vote
three years ago showed. (In that
vote, 158 to 141 voted against creating
a separate judicial system, with 80
percent of the students responding.)
In addition, one would have to ques-

~tion whether the E.C., composed
primarily of undergraduates, is a
jury of ‘“‘peers’ for the law students,
who are sometimes 10 or 20 years
older than the undergraduates.”

In spite of the criticisms of the
White Book provisions by the Law
News, third year law student and
E.C. representative Jim Humphreys
disagrees with Spratt’s assessment
of the E.C.

“The argument that the E.C. does

The decade starting in 1965 also
had many demonstrations, Press-
ley said, but those were more
varied and tended to be divided
between the 30-and-over genera-
tion and those younger than 30.

In addition to the famous rallies
for civil rights and the withdrawal
from Vietnam, people rallied for
the end of the draft, extended
rights for women, American In-
dians and Hispanic Americans,
and new lifestyles, Pressley said.

“There was polarization and
confrontation’’ everywhere, he
said. And again, people called for
revolution and changes in the Con-
stitution.

Despite the many calls for con-
stitutional change, Pressley said,
the greatest crisis for the Con-
stitution was the Watergate af-

fair

He said the founding fathers had
enough foresight to predict gov-
ernmental weaknesses and install
safeguards for citizens’ rights. By
bringing impeachment pro-
ceedings against Richard Nixon,
Congress supported the Constitu-
tional system.

Mock Convention is

re-slated for

By JOHN PENSEC
News Editor

 

Spring Term won't be the same
next year. It will be missing the mock
convention

The Executive Com :ittee of the
mock convention deci .ed it would be
for the overall good’ ; the convention
to move it from May to March. The
committee cited Super Tuesday at
the reason. Super Tuesday is when
many southern states will hold their
presidential primaries

John Gammage, co-chairman of
the convention, said that Super Tues-
day makes a May convention ob-
solete.

March ’88

He went on to say that those states
involved in Super Tuesday might
make a prediction for that day’s out-
come, but that is not definite.

The steering committee submitted
a proposal to the faculty executive
committee. The proposal concerned
itself with the Friday of the conven-
tion weekend. Usually there are no
classes that day, and the faculty E.C.
will decide if that will be the case
next year. If the committee approves

the resolution, the full faculty will
vote on it at their next meeting in
April.

Wa&L needs better Hill-student relations

 

MY VIEW
By Chris Carter

 

It takes no more that a quick
glance at last week’s Ring-tum Phi to
realize that we have a major problem
on this campus. One candidate for
Student Body President was running
on what amounts to an_anti-
administration platform — and was
considered by many to have had a
very good shot. Nearly all Big Three
candidates listed student/admin-
istration/faculty relations as a cen-
tral concern. Disparaging nicknames
for administrators are the order of
the day in student speech, and I have
myself begun to feel a growing
disillusionment upon the part of the
faculty towards their own admini-
stration. What is most discouraging
about all this is that the administra-
ar seems so completely oblivious to
it all.

A Phi editorial earlier this year ac-
cused President Wilson of viewing
everything through rose-colored
glasses. I just wish he had some
glasses so he could see at all. Under-
stand, I like President Wilson; I sup-
ported coeducation, and I believe

that in general, he has the school’s
best interests at heart. But I think
Washington Hall has become far too
ivory-coated. The recent registration
debacle is an excellent example of
what is happening around here far
too often.

Basically, the ideas behind im-
mediate class assignment were good
ones. Not only do students not have to
return in a month to pick up
schedules which will be immediately
changed during drop/add week, but,
when a few kinks are worked out, it
will help keep class sizes down and
make sure students are qualified to
take the courses in which they enroll.
But why didn’t someone tell us about
it? Nobody likes having a bomb drop-
ped on them, but that’s exactly what
happened to students last week. A
news release the week before which
explained not only the new pro-
cedure, but also why it was being
undertaken and what the difficulties
encountered and consequences might
be, would have gone a long way to
alleviate the almost universal
grumbling. Moreover, if the history
department was going to cut in half
the number of students it would take,
then it should have made students
—and advisors — aware of that fact
long before registration week. And if
the Administration is going to re-

quire such limits in enrollment, then
it needs to provide and make known
alternatives.

All this is a long way of saying that
around here, the left hand seems not
to know what the right hand is doing.
The faculty and administration often
think that the students are being
childish and obstinate; the students
think the Hill is just out to get them,
and neither side really makes any ef-
fort to understand the other. The
University Council, the perfect
organization to confront these issues,
wishes to dissolve itself, and hasn’t
played a significant role in Universi-
ty Affairs in the four years I’ve been
here. Since neither the council itself,
nor the University as a whole has
taken this group seriously, perhaps
other lines of communication might
be explored.

Obviously the E.C. is an excellent
forum for student expression. The
E.C. should make more of an effort
than it has this year, not only to ex-
press student opinion, but to explain
the reasoning behind it and to see
that the administration addresses the
issues which the Committee raises.
Certainly the Ring-tum Phi serves as
an important source of student opin-
ion; in this respect I think the Phi has
done a super job this year.

But what about the administration-

 

LETTERS

to-student side of the coin? One of
greatest criticisms which has been
leveled against President Reagan in
recent months is his failure to hold
press conferences. I think President
Wilson may have a similar problem.
He has almost no interaction with
students and is almost never seen by
them. I realize that his job does not
allow him to interact with students as
much as a normal faculty member,
but perhaps he could have monthly }
Sessions in which he would discuss a
current issue or problem and then,
ask for opinions and answer ques-
tions. Or perhaps he could send fre-
quent memos out to the student body,
as a friend of mine who transferred
from an area women’s college said:
happens all the time there.

happens all the time there.

At this stage of the game, the
method is rather unimportant: any
way of communicating more effec-,
tively and filling the Hill-to-student
vacuum would be appreciated and,
would help alleviate the feeling
which many students have that
administration doesn’t care about
the students and regards them as no
more than the cogs in some huge
State U. mill. But until some official
lines are established, students, facul-
ty, and administration alike are go-
ing to have to pay the penalty of
mutual distrust and disillusionment. ~

Cadet disputes facts of fraternity ‘brawl’

there are certain things the new administration should be
prepared to handle, regardless of today’s outcome.

First, the Menon Administration should be congratulated
for clarifying its position on scavenger hunts. Although it
took an incident of stealing federal property while on a
scavenger hunt to spur on the clarification, the phrase ‘“‘bet-
ter late than never”’ is applicable in this case.

The new administration should continue this process of
clarification and define specifically the jurisdiction of the
Honor System. It should also make clear its position on fake

IDs.

Another area that needs clarification is what constitutes an
honor violation. The White Book says that an honor violation

is lying, cheating, stealing and anything else the current stu-
dent generation deems dishonorable. But it doesn’t say how
the current student generation decides what else, in addition
to the trinity of offenses, is dishonorable.

While Washington and Lee continues the transition to a ful-
ly coeducated university, it is important that the represen-
tatives of the students, the Executive Committee, take a firm
stand on the issues of the day. The new administration needs

 

to let President Wilson and his administration know in clear
and specific terms those stands.

Valid ID only

When entering W&L, students are informed that the Honor
System is not a burden but a privilege of W&L students. Not
only can we schedule our class exams at our preference, but,
we are told, because the Honor System helps make W&L
students trustworthy, many area merchants accept our
checks and student I.D.’s as identification for checks and

proof of age.

Now it seems the G.H.Q. will not accept student I.D.’s as
proof of age. The G.H.Q. is not alone.

At Fancy Dress, the S.A.B. required that all students
show a valid driver’s license at proof of age.

Something is not right. Why are we issued useless student
identification cards that aren’t even recognized as valid iden-
tification by the organizations affiliated with the University?
How can the University expect the Lexington community to
trust the W&L community, when we don’t trust ourselves?

In last week’s edition of The Ring-
tum Phi, a letter from the Ex-
ecutive Committee appeared
under the title ‘‘A letter to the stu-
dent body.’’ The letter was ad-
dressed and sent to all W&L

To the Editors:

In reference to the article concerning the
“brawl” at Phi Kappa Psi fraternity in the 5
March issue of your school newspaper there are
several discrepancies that need to be corrected.

In the article the following statement was
made: ‘“‘...none of the cadets who were at the
scene were identified upon returning to the post,
so no disciplinary action can be taken.’ This
statement is incorrect because six cadets have
each received penalties that include two months
confinement to the post, ten demerits, and thirty-
five penalty tours. (If a cadet receives more than
seventy demerits in a semester he is suspended
for one or two semesters; one penalty tour en-

of cadets.

ing the door,” in reference to reports made by

and Lee students attacked them. It may be true
that only two or three guys were working the
door; however, other members of the fraternity
were present when one cadet requested to speak
to Sham Mennon [sic], a member of the fraterni-
ty. The fraternity brothers (approximately five
to seven) assisted the “‘two or three guys work-
ing the door’”’ in removing the cadets from the
property.

Mr. McDonald also made the statement: ‘I
think it is pathetic they let them out like that.
They couldn’t have missed them leaving.’’ This
statement questions the integrity and honor of
V.M.I.’s administration. Capt. Willcockson, the
Deputy Commandant of V.M.I., stated that:
‘cadets crawl out through windows in the back
of the barracks and sneak off the back of the
post.” Several cadets who did leave through the
entrance to barracks were placed on report for
various offenses. To the claim that V.M.I. “‘let’’
these cadets out implies V.M.I.’s administration
condones this incident; this could not be further
from the truth.

The final discrepancy regards a statement
made by Capt. Willcockson. He stated: ‘‘...(1) he
had talked to the two cadets and (2) that he held
them responsible for the fact that six other
cadets now had police records.’’ However, these
statements were made on two separate occa-
sions and are mutually exclusive events. Cadets
Miller and Murray turned themselves in at ap-
proximately 3:00 a.m. Sunday morning and ask-
ed that they be allowed to accept full respon-
sibility for the entire incident in the eyes of the
Institute. In addition, cadets Miller and Murray
requested to see the Commandant of cadets,
which was granted. On Monday cadets Miller
and Murray met with the Commandant and
again requested that they be able to accept full
responsibility for the entire event. This I know to
be true because I was present for both events.

I am not trying to justify or pardon the actions
of certain members of the corps on 28 February
-1 March, but I am merely trying to clarify the
facts surrounding the event as they actually oc-
curred.

ID demands anger senior

To the Editors:

If spending four years at an university is sup-
posed to at least partially bridge the gap between
childhood and adulthood, I suppose a certain
amount of disillusionment is to be expected.
Despite this, I find the last veil pulled from my
eyes to be particularly shocking.

Lee I.D. card which was stamped with my name,
class, brithdate, and bore a picture of me. This
card, my “‘official University identification,” is
not accepted, however, at W&L functions, as I

licenses only, I was told.

This strikes me as a strange situation, for it

does not seem unreasonable to expect the
University to accept the cards it issues. I could
understand
someplace else, where it was not common
knowledge that W&L students are bound by the
Honor Code, but not on campus. Theoretically,

if the~-card was questioned

since W&L ‘‘gentlemen” are assumed to be
trustworthy, it is unnecessary to even have the
birthdate on the card.

Iam not such a wide eyed idealist that I expect
this to be the best of all possible worlds, but I do
resent the lack of trust this situation implies. If
W&L will not honor its own identification cards,
then where does this leave the student? Ap-
parently paying, if we are silly enough, ten
dollars for an unnecessary library card with a
picture.

"Twas about this time last year that I was approached in the old milk

seems to remember, I had made all the necessary preparations and

So there I was a couple of weeks ago, once again imbibing at the

Elections need more ballot boxes

MY VIEW
By Abb Jones

Guess what? We had our “Big
Three’ election Monday and nobody
even knew about it. Whe I woke up
Monday morning, it was just by coin-
cidence that I remembered it was
election day, there had been so little
said about it earlier.

As I walked past ODK circle where
there has always been a voting box in
past elections, I saw nothing. (The
box was located next to the Com-
merce School front door.) I under-
stand that since it was raining they
wanted to keep the ballots and poll
workers dry. But as I looked towards
the library where there has always
been a voting box in the back mall in

the past, I saw nothing. (I was later
told the box was near the front door
of the library and not near the back
mall where it is usually located. OH.)

Sensing that a pattern was develop
ing, I searched for voting boxes in the
two freshmen quads. At least the
freshmen would see the boxes and be
reminded to vote, right? Wrong

Now unless the Voting Regulations
Board decided to move these boxes
inside the freshmen dorms, there
were only two boxes on campus for
the election, both moved from their
usual locations. (I don’t know what
happened at the law school, I wasn't
there.)

Now with a voter turnout of just
over 900 people, I ask this question -
what happened, VRB? Did you let the
rain scare you off? Did you just not

have enough volunteers to man more
than two voting boxes? (And before
you decide to write a letter to the Phi
telling me to volunteer to work the
polls next election, hold your shootin’
irons, fellas. | worked the freshmen
quad in front of Davis Dorm last elec-
tion.)

What I recommend is this —- why
not set up permanent indoor loca-
tions for voting boxes so as not to con-
fuse us students. Some prime loca-
tions would be the dining hall foyer,
the C-school foyer, the library foyer
(OK, so you beat me to that one), and
the law school foyer.

Approximately 50 representatives
from the Lexington, Washington and
Lee and the Virginia Military In-

Wednesday to discuss relations
among the groups.

After meeting for three and a half
hours in an ‘agenda-setting

many ideas to improve relations
among the constituencies.

Among the ideas presented were
more interaction between students,
cadets and townspeople; a coor-
dinated calendar listing events on
both campuses and in town; and bet-
ter communication among the three
groups.

“I think an exercise like this is

reasonable and fair for the accused

While Humphreys believes that the
creation of a separate judicial entity
in the law school does not have the
support of the law students, the issue
and the criticisms raised in the Law
News may well last until the pro-
blems are resolved. As the editorial
states, “...assuming arguendo that

Professor

writes on
oratory

Halford R. Ryan, professor of
speech at Washington and Lee, has
published his third book. “‘American
Orators of the Twentieth-Century:
Critical Studies and Sources’’ is the
first volume on American oratory in
30 years, according to Ryan.

Co-edited with Bernard Duffy of
Clemson University, the book is
published by Greenwood Press in
Westport, Conn.

The book is composed of 58 essays
on leading presidents, jurists,
senators, congressmen, demago-
gues, clergymen, feminists, and ac-
tivists. Each contributor discusses
the orator’s training, rhetorical pur-
poses, major speeches and ad-
dresses, and bibliography and
chronology of major speeches

Ryan contributed essays on Harry
Emerson Fosdick, Harry S. Truman
and Franklin D. Roosevelt. He also
created a glossary of rhetorical
terms. Ryan and Duffy are working
on a companion volume for pre-20th-
century orators.

Elliott speaks on Reagan

By MATHEW HORRIDGE
Staff Reporter

 

If the people in Lee Chapel last
week thought they were hearing
another Ronald Reagan, they were
—kind of.

In fact, the approximately 60 peo-
ple were hearing Ben Elliott, a
former chief of Reagan’s speech-
writing department.

With the last part of his speech
coinciding with Reagan’s response to
the Tower Commission’s report, El-
liott focused his attention on what
Reagan will need to do in response to
the Iran affair.

“His presidency is really on the
line,” Elliott said. He said Howard
Baker will make a good chief of staff
for Reagan, but Reagan needs to do
more than make personnel changes.

He needs to spend at least the next
three months making sure he knows
every aspect of what is going on in
the White House to regain people’s
confidence in him as a competent
leader, Elliott said.

Elliott said the greatest damage to
Reagan may be that people will
believe Reagan is more concerned

with looking good on television than
he is about national affairs.

Donald Regan, who resigned as
Reagan’s chief of staff, may have
been Reagan’s downfall in the Iran
affair, Elliott said.

Elliott said he noticed that Reagan
had become more removed from the
day-to-day operations of the White
House since Regan became chief of
staff. He said Regan did not keep the
president well-informed on many
many important matters, including
the Iran affair and the latest Reagan-
Gorbachev summit in Reykjavik.

Regan did not tolerate anyone
whose ideas differed from his own,
Elliott said, and those people were
often fired. The White House became
hierarchical under Regan: Regan
worked for Reagan, Regan’s staff
worked for Regan and the rest of the
White House worked for Regan’s
staff, Elliott said.

Elliott went on to discuss other
aspects of the Reagan presidency. He
said ‘‘everything Reagan does, from
the moment he goes to the Oval Of-
fice...to the time he watches televi-
sion at night, is stage managed.”

Reagan’s image as someone who

Z aay Ye An
Ve
We,

understands every person is genuine,
Elliott said. Elliott called Reagan ‘“‘a
slice of America,” and one who has a
joke or anecdote for almost every
situation.

Ironically, on the same
Reagan said his wife, Nancy,
not play a part in his decision-making
process, Elliott said Mrs. Reagan
plays a larger part than most people
may think.

Nancy Reagan does not sit in on
Cabinet meetings like Rosalyn
Carter did, Elliot said, but she wields
much greater influence than the
former first lady.

Elliott said Mrs. Reagan was very
much responsible for the resignation
of Regan and added that Secretary of
State George Shultz may be on the
first lady’s ‘short list” for not sup-
porting Reagan during the Iran af-
fair.

“Nancy Reagan has her own sense
of what this man needs to be a great
president,”’ Elliott said.

ject of the University’s Interfraterni-
ty Council and the Executive Com-

Nutrition
in the

spotlight

 

From Staff Reports

 

What is the effect of one Twinkie on
the average college student? How
about two?

Is a chef’s salad really better for
you than a plate of nachos covered
with picante sauce?

Students at Washington and Lee
will have a chance to answer those
and other questions about their diet
on March 18 at a nutrient analysis
workshop in Evans Dining Hall. The
workshop is sponsored by Washing-
ton and Lee Food Services in honor of
National Nutrition Month.

Michele Garand, the food service
nutritionist from James Madison
University, and JoAnne Willis, a con-
sultant dietician from Stonewall
Jackson Hospital, will conduct the
workshop from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.
Students will fill out a worksheet
identifying the foods they have eaten
that day. They will then receive a
computer analysis of that day’s in-
take.

Garand and Willis will analyze the
program and make recommenda-
tions on how the diet can be improved
if it is deficient in certain nutrients.
They will also answer questions re-
garding diet planning.

Earlier that day, Sharon Buckner,
a nutrition educator from the Dairy
and Food Nutrition Council, will offer
tips on nutrition fitness. Buckner will
offer tips on how to calculate calorie
needs, how to eat right but eat light,
how to lose ‘“‘blubber,”’ and how to ex-
ercise options available to control
weight.

Buckner will conduct her pro-
grams in Evans Dining Hall from

11:30a.m. to1:15p.m.

On campus housing will become
more a part of Washington and Lee
University due to the opening of
Gaines Hall next September.

The change to coeducation in the
fall of 1985 presented Washington and
Lee with the problem of over-
crowding in freshmen dorms. As a
result, many rooms designed as
singles were converted into doubles,
making for cramped living condi-
tions.

Construction began on Gaines Hall
last year as a way to solve this pro-
bliem. Baker Dorm will now be used
to house freshmen. Gaines Hall and
Woods Creek will be used to house the
main body of upper classmen and

to Lewis G. John, dean of students.
As a result, next year’s freshmen will
have more room to live, and the
freshmen dormitory rooms will
revert back to the way they were in
the fall of 1984 before coeducation,
according to John. Both law students
and upper classmen will be able to
live on campus if they wish.

“We are responding to the stu-
dent’s needs and interests,’ said
John. Where Woods Creek provides
students with separated living
quarters, John hopes that Gaines will
provide even more. ‘‘We are hoping
for a greater sense of community and
cohesiveness at the upper class
level,”’ he said.

William J. Stearns, who rents

About 90 percent of his property is

Washington and Lee through March
10.

The exhibit title ‘Don’t Grieve
After Me,” was adopted from a tradi-
tional Virginia song sung by blacks to
anticipate and celebrate emancipa-
tion. The 25-panel exhibit uses over 70
photographs to explore themes cen-
tral to the history of black Virgin-
ians.

Among the themes examined by
the exhibit are the migration pat-
terns and establishment of a black
Virginian culture; the contributions
of blacks through the range of their
skills and professions; the examina-
tion of family, community, and
religious expressions; and the
evaluation of educational achieve-
ments, community struggles, and ac-
complishments.

In addition to ‘Don’t Grieve After
Me,” an ex“ibit on ‘Lexington’s
Black Community” is on display in
the Boatwright Room of the Universi-
ty Library. The exhibit is drawn from
manuscripts, books, photos, and
handbills from the University
Library’s collection and from the
private collections of area residents.
“Lexington’s Black Community”
will be on display until June.

exhibit or to arrange group visits,

The book evolved into a general
reference work at the suggestion of
the publisher, MacDonald said.
About two-thirds of the book covers
general usage guidelines, while the
rest of the book explains the
mechanics of broadcast news writing
— the page format, how to indicate
videotape cues, how the wire ser-
vices work, handling of numbers, and
use of abbreviations and contrac-
tions.

Nine appendices to the book in-
clude a review of the ethics of jour-
nalism, an explanation of the role of
the Federal Communications Com-
mission, and a list of the nations of
the world and the pronunciation of
their capital cities.

In 1970, MacDonald co-authored a
pronunciation guide for the Virginia
Associated Press Broadcasters.

Noel T. Boaz, director of the
Virginia Museum of Natural History,
will lecture on ‘‘Recent Research in
Early Hominid Evolution” at Wash-
ington and Lee Tuesday, March 17.

The lecture will be at 5 p.m. in
Room 305 of Parmly Hall. Refresh-
ments will precede the lecture, which
is sponsored by the W&L biology-
department. The public is invited.

Boaz, an anthropologist who
specializes in early human origins,’

fossils of human ancestors. Boaz and*
other scientists collected about 1,200.
pounds of fossils that they hope will
provide evidence of earlier species of |
human-like beings. ’

The Virginia Museum of Natural,

team.
In addition to his field work, Boaz
has served as lecturer, researcher

some people question the need for
student IDs. The student ID is to
“certify that you are a student,” said
Atkins. He added that it serves the
same purpose as a library card or a
charge card in the bookstore.

Atkins also added that the student
ID can be used as a “secondary
means in order to check if the
driver’s license is valid and not
tampered with.” The GHQ has made
“a reasonable effort” to ensure that
people know the guidelines of the
identification policy, Atkins said.
Students must be able to prove their
ages because if the ABC comes in
they will want to know how the age of
the student was proven. ‘“‘It is possi-
ble to be a senior and not be of legal
drinking age,’’ said Atkins in ref-
erence to the incident involving Ran-
dolph.

Three of the local restaurants, the
Subway, The Palms and Spanky’s,
have different identification policies.
The Subway accepts W&L IDs and
will “accept anything as long as
there is a picture on it,’”’ said owner
Pat Luciano. The Palms requires a

driver’s license and if there is any
doubt about the validity of the
license, such as the presence of any ,
type of alteration, two IDs are re-

quired. And a Spanky’s manager said! '
they ‘‘require two IDs and one must .

be a Virginia driver’s license.”’ In the
case of an out-of-state license, the
license will be examined and a deci- ;
sion will be made.

“Most of the time, only people in '
Virginia can drink,” added the .
manager. He said the policy was im-
plemented two months ago, and so ’
far there have not been any problems +
or complaints about it.

The Constitution has provided
“a framework in which substi-
tutes for revolution could be
found,’ Pressley said, and this
has proven to be its strongest
point.

“IT would rather live with the
flaws of the Constitution than let
people now rewrite it,” Pressley
said,

This year marks the 200th an-
niversary of the signing of the
Constitution and Pressley wants
the celebration to be more than a
big party.

Generals sting Hornets
for first ODAC victory ever

 

By DAVID EMRICH
; Sports Editor

 

“For the Washinton and Lee
,,lacrosse team, last Saturday’s 16-6
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
‘win over Lynchburg was a lot like
,.collection time at church—everyone
contributed.

« Led by sophomore Neill Redfern

_ With four goals, and John Ware with 2
Zoals and five assists, nine different

«W&L players had a hand in the scor-
ing. Five of those players, including
Ware, scored twice for the Generals.
All in all, head coach Dennis Daly
described the afternoon as ‘‘a team
‘effort.”’

« But don’t get the idea that the

“Generals put the game away early

“and spent the rest of the afternoon
thinking about what remained of
Fancy Dress weekend. That was cer-
tainly not the case. W&L held a slim
,one-goal (5-4) lead at the half and
didn’t seem to be playing well at all.

' “T felt we would win if we ex-
ecuted,’’ said Daly. ‘In the first half
I didn’t think we were executing
'well.”’

Yet, despite playing well below

their potential, the Generals were

‘still leading at the half—mainly due
to the work of junior Sandy Harrison.

 

Senior Roby Mize hits a volley against Millersville on Tuesday.

Harrison went an amazing 15 of 18
on faceoffs for a percentage of 83.

“If we hadn’t been winning the
faceoffs in the first half it might not
have been so close,”’ said Daly.

“Sandy [Harrison] had an un-
believable day,”’ said Daly. ‘‘With
him controlling the ball and Churchy
{senior goalie John Church] playing
fairly well I can’t say I was concern-
ed with our play in the first half.

“I wasn’t pleased,’’ continued Da-
ly, “but I wasn’t concerned.”’

Daly, however, had to be pleased
with the team’s play in the second
half, particularly in the third period.

Led by Harrison’s perfect 9 of 9
performance in the third quarter’s
faceoffs, the Generals pumped in
eight unanswered goals to blow the
game wide open. This, combined
with the Hornet’s feeble two goal ef-
fort in the second half, gave the
Generals their first ODAC victory
ever.

“In the third period Church made
some key saves and some good outlet
passes and I think that ignited us,”’
said Daly.

“In the second half we played well.
We stood still and passed rather than
move around a lot.

“We started taking shots,” con-
tinued Daly. “A lot of it was just
realizing we made mistakes and cor-

recting them.”

With their first conference win
under their belts, the Generals now
turn their attention towards the top
Division III teams in the country.

Thursday afternoon at 3 p.m. the
Generals face Ohio Wesleyan, a
game that means a great deal in
terms of D-III national rankings.

Ohio Wesleyan holds the No. 3 spot
in the D-III hierarchy, behind last
year’s championship finalists Hobart
and Washington College.

“This game will be a good
barometer of where we belong in
Division III,”’ said Daly.

“They [Ohio Wesleyan] finished
third last year and they’ve only
graduated three players.

“We're going to find out whether or
not we have the ability, and if we are
a top four team,”’ said Daly.

LAX FACTS ... Redfern leads the
team in scoring with six goals and
five assists for 11 points, Ware is sec-
ond with two goals and six assists for
eight points, and junior Robbie Stan-
ton is third with four goals and an
assist for five points .. Ohio
Wesleyan is coached by former W&L
all-America Mike Pressler... In addi-
tion to Thursday's game, the Gen-
erals will also host Swarthmore on
Saturday at 2 p.m.

Netmen look flat
in 7-2 loss to Tech

By MIKE SHADY
Assistant Sports Editor

 

All great teams have those days
when they come out flat and are not
emotionally in the swing of things.
Yesterday was one of those days for
the Washington and Lee men’s tennis
team.

The Generals, ranked No. 2 in Divi-
sion III preseason polls behind defen-
ding champion Kalamazoo, Mich.,
traveled to Blacksburg, Va. to
face Virginia-Tech, only’to lose, 7-2.
The defeat came just a day after the
Generals’ 8-1 shellacking of
Millersville on Monday and left the
team’s early season record at 2-1.

The main problem for the Generals
yesterday was, according to head
coach Gary Franke, an emotional
one and not physical in nature.

“T was a little disappointed,” said
Franke. “‘We were not real intense.
This was a team we beat in the fall.

“We lost all the doubles matches

Solid start for Stickley and baseball despite two

 

By STU SHELDON
Staff Reporter

" First-year head coach Jeff Stickley
has the Washington and Lee baseball
team, which is currently 1-2, off to a
very promising start, The Generals
‘opened their season on Saturday,
splitting a doubleheader with the
West Virginia Tech Bears and con-
tinued it on Monday with a loss to
Lock Haven State.

On Monday the Generals faced
Lock Haven and absorbed their sec-
ond loss, 3-2, ina game that was call-
ed half-way through the eighth in-
ning.

Stickley felt that the team played
well against Lock Haven, and that
starting sophomore pitcher ‘‘Richard
Grace was a surprise. He pitched a
really good game. We can do well if
we keep those three starters [Grace,
senior Bill Schoettelkotte, and junior
Carter Steuart] pitching well.”

In Saturday’s double header, W&L

Castle: Academic all-American

 

‘From Staff Reports

 

For the fourth time in as many
years, a member of the Washington
‘and Lee wrestling team has been
named an Academic all-American.

Junior Steve Castle, a chemistry
major from New Canaan, Connec-
ticut is the latest student-athlete to
earn the honor.

Castle, a co-captain this past
season, went 19-5 at 118 Ibs., and plac-
ed third in the NCAA Southeastern
»Regionals held here at W&L.

“T am extremely happy for Steve,”’
said head coach Gary Franke. ‘‘He is
one of the most well-rounded student-
athletes I have had the privilege to
coach.”

Castle follows Tim Valliere (1984),
Jeff Dixon (1985), and Larry Anker
(1985) as W&L wrestlers named
Academic all-America.

Castle travelled with sophomore
Richard Redfoot to Buffalo, N.Y. last
weekend to compete in the NCAA
Division III National Championships.

Both wrestlers lost in the first
round.

Haralson: 1st team All-South

 

From Staff Reports

 

Senior Basketball player Jefferson
“Harralson topped off his extremely
»suecessful year by being named to
‘the National Association of Basket-

ball Coaches All-South Atlantic First
‘Team.

Harralson, 6-6, is a business major
from Princeton, Kentucky.

He became the Generals 11th ail-
, time scorer, finishing his career with

1,219 points.
Last season, he led the team in

scoring and rebounding, averaging
21 points and 7.8 boards per game in
1987-88.

Harralson was named the Most
Valuable Player in each of this
season's two W&L Invitaional Tour-
naments.

He was also selected to the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference First
Team.

“Tam very pleased to see Jefferson
receive this honor,”’ said W&L head
coach Verne Canfield. ‘“‘He played
well all year and really earned all the
accolades he has received.’

 

lost the first game 2-1, with Schoet-
telkotte pitching what Stickley called
“a great game.” West Virginia Tech
pushed in the winning run on a pass-
ed ball.

Stickley also praised the consistent
performance of the defense, which
became vital in the second-game
turnaround. ‘“‘We get better every
day,” said Stickley.

‘We had a chance to win. We went
to extra innings and left the winning

run on base twice. Our bats cooled
off,” Stickley said.

Led by Steuart, the Generals took
the field for the second game, which
W&L eventually won by a score of
12-1.

Perhaps the greatest highlight of
the second game was the defense,
which not only held the Bears to a

single run, but also completed six
double plays.

“We turned six doubles, one more
than all of last year. All six, however,

should have been turned. Like bat-
ting, we work on it every day,’’ com-
mented Stickley.

Sophomore Chris Cunningham re-
lieved Steuart in the sixth inning and
earned a save by keeping the
Generals out in front.

Stickley mentioned the importance
of the bullpen in the upcoming games
against Christopher Newport (away)
on Saturday and the University of
Pittsburg at Bradford (home) on
Sunday.

and that was kind of a surprise. We
didn’t perform well as a team.”

Franke cited sophomore Bobby
Matthews and junior David McLeod
as the two players performing at the
top of their games.

“Matthews and McLeod are play-
ing real well,” he said. ‘“‘We need to
work on our doubles but right now no
one stands out from the others.”

Millersville was a ‘‘good win,”’ said
Franke, but the Generals will have to
be prepared both mentally and
physically for the numerous matches
in the upcoming week. The team
plays five matches in the next six
days.

“This is a big week,” said Franke.

VOLLEYS: The Generals’ present
lineup -- Singles: No. 1-sophomore

losses

“Both teams are good, better than
WV Tech. We will have to play well to
beat them. [The] games will [both)
come down to the pitching. If we do it
right we can win,” he said.

Pitt/Bradford, an NAIA Division I
team will prove to be quite a
challenge, as will Newport, who
plays in a tougher league with a
longer season. Stickley and his team,
however, are confident in their
abilities, and are going to put on quite
a show.

Sophomore John Ware in action versus Virginia.

f

By JOHN PACKETT
Staff Reporter

 

In Saturday’s lacrosse game
John Ware scored two goals and
had five assists to make him
Washington and Lee’s Athlete of
the Week.

Ware said he felt happy about
the way he played in the game
against Lynchburg College.

“T don’t think I played too well
in the game against Virginia the
week before, but I was happy with
the way I played on Saturday,”
said Ware.

The Generals win gives them a
1-1 overall record and a 1-0 record
in the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference.

Ware said that the Generals
played well in the second half of
Saturday’s game.

“Against Virginia we played
well but we were just outmanned.
In the Lynchburg game we didn’t
get things rolling until the second
half,”’ said Ware.

When the Generals host Ohio

Wesleyan today, Ware feels that
the team is going to have to play
well.

“Ohio Wesleyan is a good team
and we are going to need and ef-
fort like Saturday’s second half to
beat them,” said Ware.

Ohio Wesleyan is currently
ranked third nationally in Divi-
sion III.

A Generals’ win would be a big
boost for the team since moving
down to Division III, said Ware.

“T think the move was for the
better because now we can actual-
ly have a chance at accomplishing
something,” said Ware.

‘We have a chance at playing in
the Division III post-season tour-
nament.”

Ware said that a big help for the
team was their training trip to
Florida.

“We were able to put in most of
our offense and defense while we
were down there. If we had stayed
here we would have not been able
to practice in the snow.”

Ware is a sophomore from Rich-
mond, Va. where he attended St.
Christopher’s High School. He
was captain of the lacrosse and
soccer teams.

Husker Dii: Ransacking the ‘Warehouse’

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Entertainment Editor

 

Some two hundred years ago,
Samuel Johnson wrote: ‘“‘Human life
is every where a state in which much
is to be endured, and little to be en-
joyed.” Which aren’t exactly comfor-
ting words, but they ring a great deal
truer than a many of us would care to
admit.

Although I could be wrong, I havea
good feeling that Husker Du would
probably agree with the Great Lex-
icographer. On the group’s stunning
new double album, Warehouse: Songs
and Stories, life is confronted and en-
dured over and over again, wrestled
into bracing pop hooks and presented
at breakneck speed. Of the twenty
tracks, perhaps two or three don’t
manage to click; yet even these
minor low points are worth an entire
roomful of Bon Jovis or Glass Tigers.

Without question, Husker Du is the
premier American rock and roll
band. They are already well on their
way to acheiving R.E.M.-like suc-
cess, and if Warehouse doesn’t do it
for them, something is certainly
wrong. No band on earth planet
works harder than these guys. Since
1984, they have released a double
album called Zen Arcade, two blister-
ing affirmations of hardcore promise

and pop smarts, and a major label
debut that saw the band turn semi-
acoustic without losing any of their
awesome power. But that wasn’t
enough, because with each outing,
Husker Du kept promising more:
Warehouse: Songs and Stories fulfills
that promise conclusively.

Songwriting credit is split evenly
between guitarist Bob Mould and
drummer Grant Hart. Perhaps
because Mould is a guitarist, his
tracks on the whole hold up better
than Hart’s; nonetheless, the whole
set rings true from start to finish.
Opening up with Mould’s These Im-
portant Years,’’ the album moves
gracefully from mind-blowing,
psycho-therapy rock to hook-laden
pop brilliance.

Mould’s tracks center around in-
ventive riffs, punctuated by the
band’s driving rhythm section. The
melody to ‘“‘Ice Cold Ice” spirals up
and over the top with gritty power,
while ‘“‘Could You Be The One’’ and
“Turn It Around’’ possess ready-for-
radio hooks and appropriately clever
lyrics. There are enough potential
hits here to fill two or three Boston
records, and Husker Du make it all
sound so easy.

But they know nothing is really
easy. On “It’s Not Peculiar,’’ Mould
presents a view of life that agrees
more with Johnson than it does
Howard Jones or any other current

pop music psychiatrist. He sings,
“Taking all of this is taking all of me
/ wish I had the energy.’’ When was
the last time you heard a rock group
announce, “You've got to learn to
compromise / To live inside the
other’s life’ when it comes to dealing
with complex human relationships?
There’s none of this naive, ain’t-the-
world-groovy garbage about Husker
Du: the human condition is much
more complicated than that.

Relationships come _ together
tenuously and fall apart painfully on
Warehouse, and why shouldn’t they?
When did someone announce that pop
music must be escapist tripe? Check
out Hart’s “She’s A Woman (And
Now He’s A Man)” and Mould’s
“Turn It Around’’ for a glimpse at
this band at the height of their
powers.

The Clash tried to imitate the
tangle of modern life with this kind of
barrel-house complexity, but their
naive global politics made it all
sound too utopian. Husker Du aren’t
concerned with politics of the exter-
nal sort, however, and that is why th
they succeed so wonderfully. As it
says in the liner notes: ‘Revolution
starts at home, preferably in the
bathroom mirror.” You could do
worse than listen to this record, and
you couldn’t do much better. Put
these guys at the top of the charts,
where they rightfully belong.

‘The Mission’ is this year’s finest film

By MICHAEL TUGGLE
Movie Critic

 

And this is the message we have heard
from Him and to announce to you, that
God is light, and in him there is no
darkness at all all.

John 1:5

In the late 1750's, the leaders of the
Spanish and Portugese cities in
Paraguay, Brazil, and Argentina
commissioned mercenaries and
slave traders to apprehend the South
American indians from their jungle
sanctuaries to serve as_ slaves.
Though the indians were little match
for Portugese artillery, the did have
one shining hope.

Director Roland Joffe now
presents the story of that hope in his
stunning motion picture, The Mission,
starring Jeremy Irons and Robert
DeNiro. On the surface, it is a simple
story about the Jesuit priests who
fought the Portugese governors for
the existence of the South American
missions. However, it is Joffes in-
tense study of the juxtaposition of
good and evil in society and man that
gives the film its awsome power.

Father Gabriel (Irons) and
Rodrigo Mendoza (DeNiro) are
Jesuits who resisist the Portugese
heads of state’s attempted abolition
of the missions. However, this is
made difficult by the personal strug-
gle they share. While they both fight
for the freedom of the missions,
Gabriel believes that the only way to

deal with the Portugese is to pray
and love, while Mendoza, a former
mercenary and slave trder, recog-
nizes the futility of pacifism and
chooses to fight them. Mendoza’s
decision creates a conflict within
himself, as he is too a Jesuit and
must love, not fight.

Obviously, the doctrine. ‘‘... the
greatest of these is love’’ does not
hold true unconditionally. The Por-
tugese threaten the indian’s home
and they are forced to choose
whether to give in to slavery and
death or to fight. As would any man
faced with losing his freedom, the in-
dians choose to fight. They are
massacred and the mission is
destroyed. However, from this
destruction comes life and hope for
the indians who live past the coming
of the Portugese and remember the
mission as it had really been: a sanc-
tuary of love and protection from the
evils of the outside world.

There are not enough superlatives
to possibly describe the quality and
power of The Mission. Robert DeNiro
and Jeremy Irons are brilliant and
truly have an injustice done to them
by not receiving Oscar nominations
for Best Actor. If there is any justice
in the world, cinematographer Chris
Menges’ photography of Columbia
and Argentina will win him a follow-
up Oscar to go with the one he receiv-
ed in 1984 for the The Killing Fields.
Roland Joffe has an excellent chance
to win the Directoral Directorial

Big Three
election
results

By JOHN STARKS
Staff Reporter

 

When the speeches were finished,
the posters taken down and the ballot
boxes put away until next election,
three of the candidates emerged as
President, Vice-President, and
Secretary of the EC. As each of these
contemplates the tasks ahead and
realizes his responsibilities, he
begins to prioritize his goals. Brad
Root, Pat Schaefer, and Mark Chiap-
para know that as the Big Three of-
ficers for 1987-88 they must plan
ahead to get started on the right
track.

For all three the foremost concern
is the welfare of the Honor System.
Vice-President-elect Pat Schaefer
says the Honor System is the chief
responsibility of the EC. He adds, “‘I
can’t change the personal honor of
students, but I can instill in them the

importance of the single sanction
Honor System.”

President-elect Brad Root, while
noticing a challenge of the single
sanction from the law school, says,
“The most important thing to do is to
clear up the misunderstanding that
this is the EC’s Honor System. It is
the students’ Honor System.’’ Root
plans to further strengthen the orien-
tation of freshmen and first-year law
students into the W&L environment
by use of an “honor symposium,”’ in
which direct interaction between new
students and the EC can take place.

Incoming secretary Mark Chiap-
para claims, ‘‘All officers must
make an impression on freshmen,
because they need to know how im-
portant the Honor System is and that

 

 

But Root wants to change the ‘‘per-
ception that the Honor System is
something to be feared. It’s there to
help us as long as we're willing to
work for it.”

Schaefer hopes that by his duty as
technical advisor to the accused he
can make sure that those accused of
a possible honor violation understand
their rights and privileges, thus
eliminating some of the fear that the
System engenders. He also replies
that attempts to codify the System
must be quelled. The Honor System
is set and practical.

Root also extends Honor System
education to new faculty, who may be
unfamiliar with such a_ situation.
Such faculty orientation was attemp-

Two weeks after the storm, pro-
blems and solutions are still being
debated with regard to the new
registration system. Begun for the
first time two weeks ago, it is still
unclear whether the on-line com-
puter system produced the problems
so many have complained about in
recent weeks, or was simply the vic-
tim of circumstances beyond its or
the University Registrar staff’s con-
trol.

The new procedure, which allowed
students to find out their schedule
within minutes of registering, gave
top priority to seniors to sign up for
classes, without the worry of being
closed out of classes with limited
enrollment.

But the system did have one side

of students, in that it unfairly closed
those courses to underclassmen,
especially freshmen.

“The system basically worked the
way it was supposed to,” said
University Registrar D. Scott Ditt-
man. “It was not only designed to
reduce the work done by my staff and
by students, but also to provide a
benefit in the form of an immediate
schedule.”’

The system previously used by the
registrar’s office would enter infor-
mation from students’ registration
forms into the computer, which
would then assign sections of classes
with no regard to the section requests
of students. ‘‘In this way,’’ said Ditt-
man, ‘“‘the new system is saving my
staff from a lot of duplication of ef-
fort.”

Dittman admitted that the new
system was not entirely without its
faults, as was the previous system.
“Lines in the mornings were a pro-

blem with the old system, but not to
the extent of there being students
camping out overnight near the line
in order to ensure themselves of cer-
tain classes.”’

“In addition, a wedge was placed
between students and faculty ad-
visors in the new system when
students began changing their
schedule and entering it into the com-
puter without first consulting the ad-
visors,’ continued Dittman. ‘‘This
became a means of bypassing ad-
visors, losing out on the input
students, faculty, and myself believe
advisors should have.”’

Dittman added that because of the
number of courses with limited
enrollment, many upperclassmen
would drop down into lower level or
less popular course, “shutting out
underclassmen and_ especially
freshmen, who seemed to bear the

AIDS threat continues to grow

 

By PAUL SMITH
Staff Reporter

 

Everybody knows that pestilences have a way of recurring
in the world; yet somehow we find it hard to believe ones
that crash down on our heads from a blue sky. There have
been as many plagues as wars in history; yet always plagues
and wars take people equally by surprise.

From THE PLAGUE by Albert Camus.

When it first appeared six years ago, it was thought to
be nothing more than a medical curiosity, a disease
manifesting itself in the form of rare cancers, of un-
conventional infections caused by very common
miscroscopic organisms with which healthy humans
could and did live in harmony. But, to individuals with
depleted immune systems, what would seem to be inoc-
cuous viruses became lethal harborers of certain death.
As the number of cases spiraled, so did the possibility
that this phenomenon would become a major public
health issue.

And so it has. In recent years, Acquired Immune Defi-
ciency Syndrome (AIDS) has emerged as one of the
most significant and devastating diseases of the twen-
tieth century. Presently, in the United States alone,
there have been more than 32,000 reported cases of
AIDS, with over 18,000 of those having succumbed to its
deadly grip. Additionally, several million individuals in
the United States are presumed to be carriers, able to
pass on the virus but unaware of their perilous condition

Outside of the United States, Africa remains the single
most devastated area in terms of the number of AIDS
cases. According to recent articles in The Times of Lon-
don, over a million people in Africa are expected to die

from AIDS in the next few years, and several more
million are carriers of the virus which causes AIDS.

The AIDS-causing virus, HTLV-III (the third known
human T-lymphotropic virus) is suspected to spread via
body fluids such as blood and semen. It is believed to be
most commonly spread via sexual intercourse and the
sharing of needles, a practice common among IV-drug
users. The virus is believed not to be spread by casual
contact such as shaking hands, hugging, casual kissing,
although deep mouth kissing is believed to pose greater
risk.

Whereas AIDS has been viewed by the medical and
scientific community as an affliction limited to certain
risk groups, notably homosexuals, bisexuals, hemo-
philiacs and users of intravenous drugs, recent evidence
suggests that the disease is oblivious to sex, race or any
other considerations. In fact, heterosexuals comprise
the largest potential risk category as evidenced by re-
cent warnings of the Surgeon General of the United
States, and other health officials across the nation.

One such official, known for his emphatic assertions of
the risk of AIDS to heterosexuals, is an infectious
disease specialist at Walter Reed Hospital in Bethesda,
MD. Robert Redfield has conducted extensive research
on AIDS among military families which have one or
more members infected with the virus. Moreover, he
has studied young military recruits who test positive for
the AIDS antibody upon entering the Armed Forces. The
results he has gathered on modes of transmission are
profound and compelling. They indicate only one thing

AIDS affects everyone, regardless of his or her sexual
preferences.

The unit fought for state’s rights

and was known as one of the best-

Stonewall Jackson was so impress-

This favoritism often arounsed
jealousy for ‘‘Stonewall’s Pets,” as
the college boys were called.

iscussion

Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a
disease affecting every socio-economic group. Regardless of
many to still consider it the ‘“‘gay plague,” it affects
heterosexuals as well as homosexuals. While it has yet to
reach epidemic proportions, there are 30,000 reported cases
of AIDS in the United States alone.

The only medicine available to control the spread of AIDS
is preventive medicine in the form of education. People need
to know that they have to use discretion in their sexual and
drug-related practices. This is not a situation where one can
say “‘It can’t happen to me,”’ because it can.

And even though the Student Health Committee has yet to
address the issue of AIDS, Dean of Students Lewis John
predicts it will. Presently the committee is trying to educate
the community by having information on AIDS at the infir-
mary.

This is not enough, and given the openness of the infirmary,
it is doubtful that many students are comfortable enough to
pick up a pamphlet. The first step toward educating the stu-
dent body can be taken by the physcial education depart-
ment.

Instead of requiring student taking gym classes to watch a
boring and out-of-date drug film, a film on AIDS would be
better.

AIDS is not a pleasant topic to discuss, but it should not be
one people are afraid to discuss.

Good P.R.

Lexington residents and merchants complain regularly
about the noise and litter that come with college parties and
about how loud/drunken/obnoxious W&L students can be.

The police ledger is filled with cases of W&L students driv-
ing while intoxicated, disturbing the peace and being drunk
in public.

W&L students, it seems, could use a little good P.R. as far
as the Lexington community is concerned.

Fraternities are willing to, and often do, do service work.
The IFC sponsors canned food drives. APO has a service pro-
ject going almost every weekend.

At last week’s Kathekon ‘‘town meeting,” community
residents suggested that a ‘‘clearing house”’ be set up so that
fraternities that want to do service work may be matched
with community groups needing help.

Fraternities and other student groups need to be their own
P.R. directors and notify newspapers and radio stations, and

LEXICON
Revolution: a call to arms

By Steven Pockrass

A small band of revolutionaries was among the smat-
tering of people scattered in Lee Chapel for last week’s
Phi Beta Kappa convocation.

It had been tough fighting against the lunch crowds
that obliviously pushed their way toward the dining hall,
but we made it.

And for that. Washington and Lee should be thankful.

For until we heard guest speaker Thomas Pressly, we
had been planning to rock this university until the Colon-
nade’s mighty white columns came crashing down. It

But Pressly changed our minds by citing examples of
how the U.S. Constitution had been flexible enough to
Pressly said. Riots and dissention could have led to
revolution.

In the late '60s and early ’70s, “‘there was polarization
and confrontation everywhere”’ due to the Vietnam War,
Pressly said. Riots and dissention could have led to
revolution.

In the depths of the Great Depression during the 1930s,
there was widespread fear and questioning of what was
to come,” said the esteemed history professor. There
were calls for revolution from the ‘‘Marxist left’”’ and the
“authoritarian right.”’ But the Constitution provided ‘‘a
framework in which substitutes for revolution could be
found.”

Whether we were on the right or the left as we sat in the
chapel really is of little concern. What is important is that
we realized that there were substitutes for revolution
here at W&L, and before we razed Gen. Lee’s college, we
were obliged to at least give them a try.

Pretty radical, huh?

Now you may be saying to yourself, ‘‘Steve, (which is a
funny thing to say to yourself), have you been nipping at
the old milk bottle? What’s all this pachyderm poop about
smashing the Colonnade into splinters?”

Well, I'll tell you. There are a lot of people around
here—students, faculty, administrators, alumni—who
think there are some grave problems at this school. Yet
despite all we’ve heard about a fraternity renaissance,
why doesn’t anyone talk about a total university
renaissance?

With all this banter about traditions and lost traditions,

why aren’t we doing anything positive to make W&L into
what we claim it to be—a national, liberal arts institution
that produces thoughtful, well-educated gentlemen. (And
I use that term in the neutered, although certainly not
emasculated, sense. )

So before the walls come tumblin’ down, we all need to
work toward the goal of improving this university. What
this means is that we must through away our old modes
of thinking and come up with some new ideas. After all,
isn’t that what college is all about?

Individual students must look at where we place our
priorities and decide what personal changes we must
make to more truly fit the Greek model of the well-
rounded person and Robert E. Lee’s model of the
gentleman.

Faculty members must continue to be accessible to
students and must provide positive reinforcement
whenever possible. They must remain knowledgeable in
their respective fields and actively support the develop-
ment of well-rounded students.

As Chris Carter so articulately pointed out in last
week’s Phi, administrators must find ways to improve
credibility and communications with students. The ad-
missions office needs to start worrying more about poten-
tial involvement in school activities than about high test
scores.

Isn’t it time that the school found a better way to con-
tact students than by sticking those stupid index cards
outside classroom doors? Isn’t it time that the SAB con-
sidered making Fancy Dress a costume ball again, and
that the EC considered making the Honor System more
open so people would understand why thievery in certain
circumstances no longer seems to be considered an honor
violation?

Isn’t it time that the faculty started posting the minutes
of its meetings so that students could find out more about
what’s going on? Isn’t it time that all of us made a con-
scientious effort to maintain the speaking tradition in-
stead of whining about its death?

I could go on, but I think you get the idea. We
revolutionaries did as we sat in Lee Chapel last week.
Let’s hope we can keep this revolution bloodless.

Underweenies respond to law goose’s opinion

To the Editors:

A couple of underweenies would like to offer a
critical review of the critical review by Charlie
Shaffer on the S.A.B.’s presentation of F.D. for
1987. Mr. Shaffer has nothing nice to say about
F.D., except of course, for the law school excur-
sion to Bean’s Bottom.

In chronological order:

Wednesday

While he didn’t catch their act, he did opine
that New Potato Caboose’s name stunk. Are we
to derive from this that because the name stunk
so did the band? Doesn’t the law school teach
that judging a book by its cover can be mis-
leading?

Thursday

The name of the opening act was indeed Con-
crete Blonde but they hail from L.A. not Ireland.
He used to think the Irish were cool until now. We
hope Mr. Shaffer is not representative of West
Virginians (or law students) else we should feel
the same way.

Friday

Your characterization of all ‘road chicks’ is
incorrect, A bunbette is a bimbo under the age of
18 (watch “Flamingo Kid’’ and learn). Most
“road chicks” are at least 18 years of age and
will, no doubt, enjoy receiving a copy of his arti-
cle.’

In closing, we feel that a 3rd law student, of at
least 25 years of age, would have watched to the
extent that blatant racism, name calling and
shallowness could be disguised a little better.
Since we're only 20 we aren’t, so listen you nasty
little law goose, fly over our house and we'll
shoot you down.

APO brings order to library

To the Editor:

I would like to thank Bob Slappey, Brent
O’Boyle, Jon Deighan, Dean Nuckols, Steven
Pockrass, and Doug Harvey, members of Alpha
Phi Omega, who gave of their time and talents
by volunteering at the Rockbridge Regional
Library on Sunday afternoon, March 1, from 1:00
to 5:00 p.m., under the able direction of volunteer
coordinator Marion Chappell.

These men worked very hard to shelf read the
collection, putting books in the right places,
straightening, and bringing order out of chaos in
the library stacks. We had had many complaints
about the condition of the stacks, and although
staff members and volunteers work away at the
job as time permits, with this team effort and
with this many expert man-hours at one time,
our library has truly been transformed over-

t.

The library staff and users have marvelled at
this sudden improvement, and want your
readers to know how much the tireless efforts of
APO have meant to the library and to the com-
munity. Thank you!

GHQ ID policy outlined

To the Editor:

I am writing this letter in response to Thom
Randolph's letter and the editorial in last week’s
Phi regarding valid I.D.’s. As head of security
for the G.H.Q., I would like to make it clear that I

work for Mr. Bill Torrence, manager of the
G.H.Q., and that I ultimately answer to Mr.
Jerry Darrell, the Director of Food Services,
which means that security at the G.H.Q. is in no
way under the control of the SAB. Early in the
school year, at the request of Mr. Torrence, I
met with representatives of the A.B.C. to discuss
issues such as “‘carding”’ procedures.

I was told in this meeting that college I.D.’s
were not considered by the A.B.C. to be valid
proof of a persgn’s age, and that allowing per-
sons to drink alcoholic beverages based solely on
this would put our beer licenses in serious
jeopardy. Upon asking what constitutes a “‘valid
I.D.,” I was told that a valid driver’s license with
a picture or a military I.D. would be the best
defenses if we had to go before the A.B.C. Board.
I was also told that it would be in our best in-
terest to check two forms of I.D., each with a
clear picture.

In the past it has been the responsibility of the
SAB to card at the door. The week before the in-
cident with Mr. Randolph, however, I personally
observed between 15 and 20 freshmen and soph-
omores drinking with stamps on their hands
showing them to be of legal age. This puts the
G.H.Q. ina compromising position, as a violation
of the A.B.C. rules could result in the loss of our
beer license. It is now the responsibility of
G.H.Q. security to card all G.H.Q. patrons.

Mr. Darrell, after recently conferring with the
area A.B.C. representative and the E.C.,
developed a new carding policy for the G.H.Q.,
which is as follows: if you are of legal drinking
age and wish to drink, you must present two
I.D.’s at the door, one of which must be a picture
license or a military I.D. (area college I.D.’s will
be accepted as a second I.D. only); if you are
under age, you must present an area college I.D.
to gain entrance (this is to keep high school
students out). Non-students of drinking age will
be permitted only if they show two I.D.’s at the
door, and no intoxicated persons will be admitted
regardless of I.D. This new policy will be strictly
enforced at all G.H.Q. functions. Let me also add
that we may admit anyone whom we know or be-
lieve to be of legal age without checking their
I.D. This saves us time in that we do not have to
card people who appear to be 45, or friends we
know to be 21; so in the future, Mr. Randolph, do
not get bent out of shape when we admit a buddy
of yours without checking his I.D.

The new procedure is not meant to keep
anyone from having a good time, it is merely an
effort on our part to retain our beer license.
Drinking at the G.H.Q. is a privilege, not a right,
and may be taken away by the A.B.C. at any
time. So save yourself a hassle, Mr. Randolph,
and bring your W&L I.D. and your driver’s
license if you wish to drink.

Darrell discusses ID policy

An open letter to the student body:

Since the responsibility for the ABC license in
the GHQ tavern is mine, I am responding to
Thom Randolph’s letter and the editorial in the
March 12 Phi. The GHQ Tavern is licensed by the
state of Virginia to sell beer on premises.
Licenses are not available for the asking.
There is quite a lengthy and detailed process in
making application. Once approved, however,
the licensee is bound by the laws of the state of
Virginia. If the laws are not enforced by the
licensee, the license is history, and the privilege
of serving beer is revoked. We then have a dry
tavern. It’s that simple. It happens all the time.

The state of Virginia requires an official docu-
ment with a picture, date of birth and signature
as a first form of identification and “strongly
suggests’ a second I.D. with a picture and/or
signature (I have every indication that this se-
cond I.D. will soon become law). This identifica-

tion is required of anyone who wishes to pur- |

chase alcoholic beverages. The state no longer
recognizes a college I.D. as a valid form of ABC

identification (because it has been so blatantly

abused at other colleges across the state).

What would our student body have us do? We
can request that the ABC Board, because of the
special circumstances here at W&L (the honor
system) allow us to accept the W&L I.D. (and I
would recommend the VMI I.D. as well), at GHQ
as identification; that the students would in fact,
be stating that ‘under my honor I am of legal
drinking age in the state of Virginia.” The penal-
ty for violating this trust is obvious. The ABC
people have warned us that this measure will
greatly endanger our license. History has shown
in the GHQ that it sometimes does not work. Ask
any of our GHQ student security people (not to be
confused with the SAB ticket sellers) about their
problems in attempting to enforce the law!

Effective this date the following policy is in ef-
fect in GHQ: On Wednesdays and other band
nights, only students with college I.D.s will be
admitted. Only those with a valid driver’s license
will be permitted to purchase beer. Other non-
students, over 21 years of age only, will be admit-
ted with two form of identification.

MSA praises history exhibit

To the Editors:

I would like to sincerely thank Peggy Hays at
the University library for her work with the
black history exhibit ‘‘Don’t Grieve After Me.”’
Not only did she arrange for this exhibit on her
own, but she chose a very appropriate place for
the exhibit. With registration being moved to the
lower level of the library this year, all students
got a chance to view the exhibit. Hopefully,
many students took some time to view the entire
display. The members of the Minority Student
Association thank Peggy Hays for the work she
has done, in addition we think she should be com-
mended.

Elections draw 56 candidates

 

By MARGARET PIMBLETT
Staff Reporter

The onslaught of campaign posters
has begun—it’s time for class elec-
tions.

Elections for president, vice-
president and Executive Committe
representatives for the rising
sophomore, junior and senior classes
will be held next Monday.

Fifty-six candidates submitted
petitions and attended the Voting
Regulations Board meeting last Mon-
day. Of those candidates, 15 are ris-
ing seniors, 16 are rising juniors and
25 are rising sophomores.

Twelve students are competing for
president of their classes, 19 for vice-
president and 25 for E.C. represen-
tative.

The most-hotly contested race is
for rising sophomore Executive Com-
mittee representative, with 13 cand-

candidates.

Six women are running for class of-
fices, including four freshmen and
two sophomores. Of the women can-
didates, one is vying for class presi-
dent, two for class vice-president and
three for E.C. representative.

Scott Yancey, vice-chairman of the
VRB, explained the election rules to
the candidates in the abscence of
VRB chairman John Scannapieco,
who was in Florida at the time of the
meeting.

Yancey said that each candidate is
limited to 15 posters on campus—the
Colonnade and other academic
buildings, the library, the bookstore
and snack bar, dormitories, the
University Center and the dining
hall.

Woods Creek Apartments and fra-
ternity houses are not included in the
poster limit, Yancey said, because
the VRB considered them off-campus
living areas.

Posters cannot be placed on

Convention Sicaiaers underway

By OLLY WILLIAMS

Staff Reporter

 

Preparations for Washington and
Lee’s Mock Constitutional Conven-
tion to be held May 2, 1987 are well
under way. The five issues that will
be debated have been announced.
The proposed amendments include a
balanced budget, right-to-life, state’s
rights, line-item veto, and equal
rights.

According to Deborah Hattes,
Chairman of the Rules and Regula-
tions Subcommittee of the Conven-
tion Steering Committee, ‘‘What we
are holding is a Mock Article V na-
tional constitutional convention.’’
Although a convention of this nature
has never been held in the history of
the United States, it is one of the two
constitutionally mandated ways to
amend the constitution.

Hattes reiterated that “‘it is hard to
know exactly what would be done
because it has never been done.”’

The steering committee is trying
“to simulate what would happen at a
constitutional convention if one were
held this year.”

The issue of a convention has
arisen in light of the bicentennial an-
niversary of the U.S. Constitution
and because 32 of the necessary 34

states have petitioned’ Congress to
call a convention to consider a
balanced budget amendment. °

Hattes explained the process used
to determine what issues will be
debated.

“What we did is to follow the same
procedure the states would do. We
asked state chairmen to turn in peti-
tions calling for a convention and for
specific issues.”’

One method used by state chair-
men to collect information from their
states was contact with state officials
and elect representatives.

Hattes explained that the Rules
and Regulations Committee decided
to take five pre-selected issues to the
floor.

Thirty three states submitted 98
petitions. Two additional states turn-
ed in petitions late that are not in this
official talley. The top five issues
were: Balanced Budget Amendment
with 25 states, Right-to-life Amend-
ment with 15 states, States’ Rights
with 10 states. An amendment allow-
ing a line-item veto tied with the
Equal Rights Amendment with both
proposals receiving endorsements
from 6 states.

Hattes said that ‘a lot of in-
teresting issues did not receive
enough votes to be considered.’’ Ex-
amples include making English the

ted this year but only in one meeting,
with no follow up to the ‘‘one-shot”’
process. Root intends to change that.
Clearly the Honor System is at the
top of the new Big Three’s goals.

On more particular matters, Root
cites the importannce of student
viewpoint and the solicitation of stu-
dent concerns in which he ‘‘won't
back down before administrative
proposals that students don’t like.”
However, he does want to bridge the
gap between the administration and
student body.

Schaefer notes that Student Control
rules will be up for review, and he
will work for a middle ground be-
tween the sentences of social proba-

McAhren.

“The problem can probably be
remedied by reserving spaces for all
students,”’ continued McAhren. ‘‘The
cost would be that fewer juniors and
seniors would be able to take desired
history courses.”

In the past, students could avoid
limits in class sizes by getting per-
mission from instructors early,
enabling majors and _ interested
students to enroll early in the courses
they desired. To retain the advan-
tages of this, says McAhren, the
history department is considering
maintaining the restrictions imposed
by the new system, but allowing per-

tion and suspension for violations.
One is a ‘‘slap of the wrist” the other
“very extreme.’’ He also notes the
“minor” problem of parking in the
“corral” which can be solved by
elimination of medians. On the issue
of the budget, he says he will keep a
sharp eye on funds of large organiza-
tions like SAB.

Chiappara says he intends to
quicken the distribution of the EC
minutes and honor reports because
“it’s important that students know
our actions as soon as possible. We
owe them that.’’ He also urges
students to attend the EC meetings
Monday evenings at 7:00 PM.

All in all, the Big Three have big
ideas for next year’s EC. They all
look forward to working together for
the betterment of W&L, while main-
taining the individuality for which
they were elected. As the cornerstone
of the EC, their goals are paramount
to the smooth running of student
government. They have a lot ahead.

mission for early enrollment. ‘‘This
would retain the flexibility of the old
system, but would probably elim-
inate some of the advantages of the
on-line system.”’

“But again, limited class sizes is
the real problem we have to get
around,”’ said McAhren. ‘‘We have to
restrict enrollment to a certain ex-
tent for more student-teacher in-
teraction to be possible. It’s a pro-
blem that will continue to exist under
any system used.”’

“We are hoping that we can retain
the on-line system, changing it to
make it more valuable and less pain-
ful,” said Dittman. ‘“‘The relative

official language, changing the
Presidential term and dismantling
the Electoral College.

Now that the top five issues have
been decided, issue committees are
in the process of meeting. Each issue
is being addressed by a committee
composed of representatives from
ten states. The issue committee has
the job of ‘‘taking all the petitions on
a particular issue and putting those
into one proposed amendment, writ-
ten in constitutional language that
will be put before the convention of
May 2nd,” said Hattes.

Julie Sheppard, Rules and Regula-
tions ad hoc member to the Balanced
Budget Committee explained how
her committee has followed this pro-
cess. ‘‘We held a meeting last week,
and we identified the differences
among the proposals of 27 states for
the Balanced Budget Amendment,”’
she said. ‘We are holding a second

REBELS

 

(continued from page 1)
Rebels and Yankees are expected.

Most of the participants in these
battles come in well-organized units,
and the group is hoping to recruit
enough members to be able to attend
events as the “Liberty Hall Volun-
teers.”

In the meantime, though, the
reenactors have to join with other
groups.

Participants in these renactments
are very serious about creating the
same atmosphere that a real Civil
War soldier would have felt, accord-
ing to Williamson.

The minimum a new recruit would
need to attend a reenactment is a full
uniform, a haversack, and a weapon.

The weapon is the most expensive
part of the set-up, with a replica of a
Civil War Enfield rifle costing over
$200, according to Williamson.

Used uniforms, he said, are easy to
buy at reenactments.

“This can be a fairly expensive
hobby, with guns and rifles,” he
noted.

To help with costs, the EC supplied
the group with money to buy two
rifles, and more money is expected
for weapons next year.

newness of this system lent itself to
problems, but problems that can be
ironed out in time. The question
students unhappy with the system
should ask themselves is whether the
benefit of an immediate schedule,
with the desired time slots and pro-
fessors, is worth sacrificing some
personal contact with faculty. It is a
question I myself am trying to find
out,”’ Dittman continued.

Dittman asked that question at
Monday’s meeting of the Executive
Committee. At that meeting, he
heard both positive and negative
views of the current system, and
went on to take a ‘‘grass roots’ poll

meeting to.debate the relative merits
of the various suggestions to for-
mulate a final amendment pro-
posal.”’

“We'd like to publicize them so
state delegations can firm up their
state’s positions and so that pro and
con sides can start formulating their
debates,” said Hattes. She added
that the Rules and Regulations Com-
mittee will not coordinate either side
— it is up to the states themselves to
develop pro and con debates.

More than 500 students have
already joined delegations, but the
steering committee hopes to involve
as much of the student body as possi-
ble in the convention. Lists of state
chairmen can be found around cam-
pus, particularly in the Student
Center. Students may join a delega-
tion by simply contacting a state
chairman.

The plan, then, is for the unit,
through the school, to purchase
weapons, and for the individual
members to supply all the ac-
cessories.

Because the school is helping with
finances, Williamson said the unit
would be “more than happy’’ to
assist at school ceremonies as a sort-
of honor guard.

VMI has a well-equipped, school
sponsored reenactment group, and
Williamson hopes to get together
with them for local reenactments,
such as Hunter’s raid on Lexington.

“We could burn VMI,”’ he said,
citing one of the results of that Civil
Warn raid on Lexington.

Also, Williamson wants to attract
people who are just interested in
black powder weapons.

The rifles used by the unit are
black powder guns, and firing prac-
tice is available at the VMI rifle
range.

Women can take part in the re-
enactments as well. They attend in
the role of nurses, wives, or “camp
followers.”

In the meantime, ‘‘We are just like
the Confederate Army,” Williamson
said, ‘‘we need two things: men and
equipment.”’

Hall Volunteers will be drilling at
Liberty Hall on Sunday at 2:30 p.m.

of the general opinion of the students
present.

Responding to Dittman’s inquiry,
some students expressed concern at
the loss of closeness associated with
on-line registration. ‘‘Students
sometimes felt they were treated like
a number, rather than a person,”
commented Andrew Caruthers,
senior class representative on the

Executive Committee.

The general concensus of the poll
was that a majority of students
favored having their choice of

classes over having their choice of
sections, professors, or days, even
when known in advance.

is pure as the driven snow, that’s not going to assure that
by Thanksgiving we don’t have a certain number within
the population who have been to Charlottesville,
Roanoke, Atlanta, and have experimented (sexually).”

“I think screening would offend everybody,’ adds
Schroer, “It would offend parents and alumni. I think
Washington and Lee would be the last school to come
down with that sort of regulation. It would be in every
other school in the state of Virginia before we even begin
to talk about it here.’’

Although the very mention of AIDS can conjure up
images of innocent individuals ravaged by a physically
devastating disease, the psychological impact is often
overlooked. Depression and solitude are two emotions
experienced by many victims of AIDS, both those who
have been infected by the virus, and those who have not.

Describing one phenomenon associated with the AIDS
epidemic, Worth recalled one student who feared aids,
yet had no rational reason for his fear. “I’ve already
seen one case of AIDS phobia,”’ says Worth, ‘‘...the guy
hadn’t even had intercourse with anybody. I think we
will see a lot more of that. I think counseling students
who have unreasonable fears about AIDS is going to be
one thing (we must consider).”’

But students who face a positive antibody test must
face the real test — the depression, the frustration, and
the sense of isolation brought on by a stigmatic disease
which society does not accept.

“Counseling a victim (of AIDS) is a very special
thing,’’ says Worth. ‘‘You’re counseling the terminally
ill, or that person in limbo who has the positive an-
tibodies; they’re sitting on a ticking time bomb. I think
that’s going to be a very special kind of counseling situa-
tion. I’ve never counseled anybody in that position.”’

Keeling explains that people who test positive on the
AIDS antibody test ‘‘eventually integrate that into their
lives, but they typically have a period of time where it’s
real hard and they get very depressed. They question
their priorities; they worry about their current relation-
ships — sexual partners, previous sexual partners, who
might they have infected...they lose their trust. They
often do feel isolated.”

“That's the reason for all this counseling (counseling
before and after the blood screening test), because if
they are left to deal with all that with no reference point,
suicide is a real problem. And people with AIDS commit
suicide at an alarming rate. What we try to help people
do is to live with this rather than run away from it, either
by ignoring it or committing suicide,” Keeling says.

Worth agrees, noting that this is common among per-
sons with incurable diseases: ‘‘I think some people who
get AIDS will probably commit suicide just as people
with incurable cancer. When someone has an incurable
disease, there is a certain natural thought — ‘Do I want
to just let the disease play its course or do I want to take
control and at least time my death when I want it to be,
and how I want it to be, with perhaps more dignity, with
less pain, with less expense.’ I can see a person with a
terminal illness such as AIDS making a rational argu-
ment for suicide. I’m not saying I recommend that. I am
not saying I would do that myself.”’

As AIDS spreads deeper into our society both medical-
ly and psychologically institutions and individuals will
have to respond accordingly. Since there is no cure for
the disease, individuals should follow basic safety prac-
tices. According to the American College Health
Association these include reducing the number of sexual
partners, knowing your sexual partners, avoiding the
exchange of body fluids by using condoms all of the time,
avoiding the use of intravneous drugs and finally
avoiding the mix of alcohol and sexual encounters which
could cloud one’s judgement.

“Ellen Goodman wrote a recent piece in the Wash-
ington Post that I felt was very good,” explains Worth,
“If you recall the last point, that it would be a great
tragedy if the AIDS virus proves to be more adaptive
than the human beings that are victimized by it. I really
agree with what she says.”

“T just hope that it won’t have to get to the point when
all of a sudden 47 W&L students come down with AIDS
and are dead within a year,” says Worth. “The hope is
through education it won’t have to get to that point,
before students start taking precautions.”

A pestilence isn't a thing made to man’s measure,
therefore we tell ourselves that pestilence is a mere bogy of
the mind, a bad dream that will pass away. But it doesn’t
always pass away and, from one bad dream to another, it is
men who pass away, and the humanists first of all, because
they haven't taken their precautions. -Albert Camus.

Wa&L staff
conducts

lab survey

From Staff Reports

The staff of Washington and Lee’s
laboratory of anthropology recently
completed a Phase I archaeological
survey of a sewage treatment im-
provement area in Radford, Va.

Under contract with Anderson and
Associates of Blacksburg, Va., the
archaeologists implemented a sys-
tematic testing method designed to
identify cultural resources within the
site area.

Two prehistoric areas and one
historic activity area were identified
and assessed with respect to the
criteria for eligibility for inclusion on
the National Register of Historic
Places. Although the assessment
concluded that the three areas were
not significant, the archaeologists
recommended that the two prehis-
toric areas be monitored during con-
struction.

Their survey was published in a
report by Dr. John McDaniel, direc-
tor of the laboratory of anthropology
and principle investigator, and Kurt
Russ, research archaeologist who
served as project director. Field and
lab assistants included W&L under-
graduates Bill Londrey, John Metz,
Rob Merritt, Frank Kannapell, Bill
Gossman and Rick Rodius.

 

Magazines,

: working

- Currently, Washington and Lee
‘+ University’s many campus publica-
- tions are working busily to meet their
- collective deadlines.
Sean Butler, President of the
. Publications Board, said, ‘‘Most of
the campus publications come out
two times a year.” This includes the
Ariel, the Washington and Lee
Political Review, the Washington
and Lee Journal of Science. The
Calyx, the student yearbook, is
issued only once a year.

Butler is also editor of the Ariel,
the student literary magazine. The
fall/winter issue of the Ariel came
out in mid-January, and the spring
issue is slated for late May, accor-
ding to Butler. The Ariel publishes
solicited contributions of original
writings from the student body. This
includes poetry, short stories and
essays. The Ariel also publishes
drawings and photography. Submis-
sions for the next issue of the Ariel
need to be submitted to Carol
Calkin’s office in the University
Center by April 15.

The Washington and Lee Political
Review also comes out twice a year.
The fall/winter issue came out last
week and was filled with varied ar-
ticles concerning political issues, as
is usual for the Review. Unlike other
college reviews, the Review does not
have a certain ideology. However,
the Political Review will have its
first theme for the spring issue of this
year, said co-editor John Pensec. The
other co-editor is Alex Bryant. Ar-
ticles in this issue will concern the
Mock Constitutional Convention and
the surrounding _ bicentennial
celebration, Pensec said. Submis-
sions are accepted from all members
of the W&L community.

The Washington and Lee Journal of
Science is a publication of the W&L
Biology Forum, instead of the Pub-
lications Board. All other campus
publications are supervised by the
Board, which is composed of the
editors and business managers of
these publications. The Pub Board
also decides the budgets of and
supervises each publication to insure
that they are serving the best in-
terests of the W&L community.

The W&L Journal of Science pub-
lishes articles concerning current
science-related topics. All students
and faculty are allowed and urged to
submit articles. One need not be a
science major to participate. The
Journal of Science has not put out an
issue yet this year.

The Calyx, is still working on
schedule, said co-editor Christian
Blessey. The other co-editor of the
Calyx is Roger Reynolds. Last year’s
Calyx came out on schedule, during
orientation week, but the ’85 Calyx
was issued six months late. Blessey
said that they are working with a
staff of fifteen to twenty members
who are “really hard workers.” He
expects that the yearbook to come
out on time this year.

Lax defeats nation’s third ranked team

By DAVID EMRICH
Sports Editor

Last week the Washington and Lee

lacrosse team proved that a drop in

divisional Status can certainly pro
vide a rise in excitement.

They won three times to raise their
record to 4-1.

Given the opportunity to seriously
compete for a national title for the
first time in several years, the
lacrosse team proved that they
belonged at the top of the Division II]
heap with a win over the Ohio
Wesleyan Battling Bishops — the
third ranked team in the Preseason
D-III poll.

Last Thursday’s 12-8 home victory
over the Bishops was keyed by a
number of factors, including senior
goalie John Church's 15 save day and
junior Sandy Harrison's excellent job
in the faceoff circle, but mostly by
the superior team play of the
Generals.

“My feeling is that the team is do-
ing what it needs to win,”’ said head
coach Dennis Daly. ‘We're playing
together as a team, and everyone
feels a part of the goals.

“There is a real sense of team
play,’’ said Daly.

In the first quarter, the Bishops
spent a lot of time in the General’s
defensive zone, but could only score
once, with 8:35 remaining in the
period.

“One of the big points of the
game,” said Daly, ‘‘was that they on-
ly got one goal [in the first quarter]
even though they controlled the ac-
tion

“We controlled them offensively,”
stated Daly.

The score remained 1-0 in favor of
Ohio Wesleyan for nearly eight
minutes until the Bishops were
whistled for slashing. Senior Bill
Garravante cashed in on the extra
man situation to tie the score with
0:49 remaining in the opening
quarter.

“We felt very good at that point,”
said Daly. ‘‘We controlled them in

our end, only allowing them one goal
and then we take the ball down and
score on our first or second shot of
the game.”

The Generals continued handling
the Bishops defensively while at the
same time putting the ball into the
net themselves.

W&L lead widened to 4-1 when
sophomore Neill Redfern scored in
an extra man situation with 4:48 re-
maining in the second quarter, but
Ohio Wesleyan fought back.

The Bishops scored twice before
the half to trim the lead to 4-3, and,
after the goal that put Ohio Wesleyan
within one, Daly decided to call a
time out.

“It was a momentum stopping
time out,’’ said Daly.

“We felt that their last two goals
were our mistakes and we told our
players to calm down and play really
tight.”

“The worst thing that could have
happened,” said Daly, ‘‘was if they
had tied it.”’

“If that had happened we would
have gone into the locker room with
our heads hanging and there would
have been some finger pointing.”

But that was not to be the case as
the General’s Redfern made an ex-
cellent play to widen the Generals
slim lead, and the half ended with
W&L holding onto a 5-3 lead.

‘We got the momentum back right
before the half,’’ said Daly.

The two teams traded goals for
most of the third quarter and the first
third of the fourth quarter when, with
the Generals leading 8-6, Redfern
and junior Robbie Stanton each
scored twice in a three-and-one-half
minute span to put the game away
and claim a position for the Generals
among the D-III elite.

Daly, however, was not so pleased
with yesterday’s 13-10 win over Divi-
sion I Notre Dame.

The Generals fell behind 1-0 in the
first five minutes of the game, but
stormed back to take the lead, 2-1 on
sophomore John Ware’s first of five
goals.

The lead was short lived through,

Sophomore Mike Jones jars

as the Irish tied the score in 55
seconds and continued to score—
putting in four unanswered goals to
build a 6-2 lead with just under 11
minutes to go in the first half.

Making matters worse for W&L,
during this entire time the Generals

couldn’t seem to mount any type of
sustained offensive threat. They
were taking poor shots and weren’t
getting second chances.

“You have to give them [Notre
Dame] credit for their early play,”
said Daly.

“They played tough defense.”

Then the Generals seemed to find
their game a little. They slowed the
tempo down and took their time on of-
fense. The result was two goals
before the half to narrow the Irish
lead to 6-4.

Tennis teams trounce foes; both post important wins

Davidson match called
‘Franke’s biggest win’

 

By MIKE SHADY
Assistant Sports Editor

 

Okay. Maybe we were a little rough
on the Washington and Lee men’s
tennis team last week. But like a true
great team, the General’s responded
and put together a week that included
a win that was head coach Gary
Franke’s best since his arrival at
W&L.

The Generals went 3-1 over the six-
day stretch with wins over Division II
Slippery Rock (8-1) and Old Domin-
ion Athletic Conference member
Emory and Henry (9-0). But it was
Friday’s 5-4 win over Div. I Davidson
that Franke said was ‘‘my biggest
win since I have been at W&L.”’

“Tt was a big match,’’said senior
captain Roby Mize. ‘‘ Davidson came
down to our invitational tournament
in the fall and pretty much cleaned
up.
“The win was a surprise to us as
well as a surprise to them. For coach
Franke, it was probably his biggest
win here.”

Winners for W&L were: Mize at
No. 4 singles; junior Chris Wiman at
No. 5; freshman John Morris at No.
6; and the doubles teams of
sophomore Bobby Matthews and
junior David McLeod at No. 1 and
Wiman and Morris at No. 3.

The Generals’ only loss of the week
came on Saturday against Div. I Fur-
man, 7-2. W&L hoped to score
another big upset with the momen-
tum created by the Davidson victory,

but this time it was not in the cards.

“We were coming off the high of
beating Davidson,’ Mize said, “‘but
Furman was just too tough for us.
There were a couple of three-setters
and the score could have been dif-
ferent, but they handled us pretty
solidly.”

“We are playing well,” said
Franke, ‘‘against some top competi-
tion and even in our losses we have
looked good.”’

There was no surprise on Tuesday
as an overmatched Emory and
Henry posed little problem for the
Generals. W&L has been the ODAC
champion in three of the past four
seasons.

The win also marked the first time
this year that newcomer Robert
Haley has won at No. 1 singles. Ac-
cording to Mize, Haley, a sophomore
transfer from West Point, has not
been able to “‘find his groove.”’

“Haley’s capable of being a
superstar,” Mize said, ‘‘but it’s going
to take some time.

“‘We’ve had that problem [No. 1
singles losing] for the past few years.
It seems that our No. 1 always runs
into a great player on the other
teams.”

VOLLEYS...Matthews, Mize,
McLeod and Wiman all share the top
spot for individual records with 4-2
marks.... The doubles team of
McLeod and Matthews has been
stellar so far in posting a 6-1
record.... The team’s record now
stands at 4-2.

Neill Redfern

By JOHN PACKETT
Staff Reporter

 

Lacrosse attackman Neill
Redfern scored 10 goals and had
three assists in three games, mak-
ing him Washington and Lee’s
Athlete of the Week.

Last week’s effort raised Red-
fern’s season total to 16 goals and
eight assists.

With Redfern’s help, the Gen-
erals beat Notre Dame, Swarth-
more, and Ohio Wesleyan to up
their record to 4-1.

“I was happy with my effort last
week but feel that there are a few
minor areas in which I can im-
prove my play,”’ said Redfern

Last Thursday’s win over Ohio
Wesleyan, who was at the time
third in the nation in Division III,
was a big win for the Generals, ac
cording to Redfern. In that game
Redfern scored five goals and had

k

one assist.

“The win was our biggest so far
and it sets the tone for the rest of
the year,’’ said Redfern.

“The win put us in a good posi-
tion in Division III,”’ said Redfern.

According to Redfern, though
the Generals have played well this
year, they haven't reached their
potential as a team.

“T think we have the ability to
do great things,” said Redfern.

“If we can keep our concentra-
tion we could be 12-1 and have a
good shot at being in the Division
III tournament,”’ said Redfern.

Redfern said that his goal for
the season is to play in the finals of
the Division III tournament.

“T think it would be awesome,”’
said Redfern.

Redfern is a sophomore from
Norfolk, Va. There he attended
Norfolk Academy where he was
captain of the lacrosse and wrestl-
ing teams.

Women surprise Hollins
with 5-4 win; will be without

3 for matchup with Hornets

 

By MARGARET PIMBLETT
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee women’s
tennis team avenged last year’s 9-0
loss to Hollins College by opening
their 1987 season with a 5-4 victory
Tuesday over Hollins on the road.

Singles winners were sophomores
Dana Anstine and Benny Savage and
freshman Theresa Southard. They
were joined by the doubles pairs of
sophomores Martha Christian and
Valerie Pierson and Southard and
fellow freshman Laura Eggers.

“I’m delighted with the win,”’ said
head coach Bill Washburn. ‘‘Hollins
has always been in the top echelon of
the ODAC.”

Last year’s W&L team wound up
its season with a 1-8 record and ninth
place out of ten teams in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference.

The team was in its initial season,
with one sophomore player and all
the rest freshmen. This year, nine
players returned with a year of col-
legiate tennis experience under their
skirts.

Five of the top six seeds are

sophomores. First-seeded Bitsy Hop-
per retains her position, followed by
Anstine, Katherine Nelligan,
Southard, Christian and Savage.

Other returning members of the
team are sophomores Courtney
Coyle, Leeann Flood, and Jennifer
Newmark.

Washburn said Tuesday’s win over
Hollins was particulary gratifying
because it showed that the team had
“developed some degree of con-
fidence and experience.”’

“The team showed a certain
amount of determination and gut-
siness,’’ he said.

That gutsiness should help the
team in its match today at Lyn-
chburg, which will be played without
three of the General's top five
players.

Neither Anstine nor Nelligan will
participate because of academic
commitments. Christian has an
ankle injury.

Their positions will most likely be
filled by Eggers, Newmark and one
other member of the team.

Washburn said he expected the
competition from Lynchburg to be
“not as stiff’’ as what the team faced
in the match against Hollins.

Schoettelkotte injured
during baseball’s loss

 

By STUART SHELDON
Staff Reporter

 

 

 

The Washington and Lee Baseball
team travelled to Bridgewater Col-
lege on Tuesday to play the first
game of their Old Dominion Athletic
Conference season. Bridgewater is
the number one seed in the ODAC
this season.

Bridgewater defeated W&L by a
score of 10-3. The Generals’ overall
record fell to 2-4 with the loss, and
their ODAC record stands at 0-1.

Although the Generals lost, head
coach Jeff Stickley said that the 10-3
loss ‘‘really wasn’t that bad. We were
down by one, 4-3, in the sixth. They
put together a lot of hits,’’ and ‘‘we
made some costly defensive errors”
late in the game.

One disadvantage put on the Gen-
erals late in the game was the injury
of Senior pitcher Bill Schoettelkotte,
who damaged his ankle in a close
play at first base.

Schoettelkotte was diagnosed as
having a broken ankle. He will be out
for an indefinite amount of time.

The Generals’ usually strong offen-
sive also faltered late in the game. In
the first five innings, W&L had eight
hits, while the last four innings only
produced two hits. Stickley mention-
ed this as an area needing improve-
ment.

“We need to improve our ability to
put together hits, (concentrate them
in an inning or two) as well as our
ability to hold onto a lead,” he said.

The ability to hold on was also lack-
ing last Saturday, when the Generals
travelled to Christopher-Newport.

Washington and Lee led 4-3 going
into the ninth inning, but a series of
three walks managed to push the
winning run across home plate.

Stickley felt that the pitchers,
Schoettelkotte and Cunningham, ran
into some problems with control that
allowed these walks to occur,

Although the Generals do not sport
a winning record, ‘‘we are by no
means down,” said Stickley. ‘“‘We
need to play more...we are still mov
ing people around”’ in an attempt to
discover their abilities. ‘‘We are get-
ting better,”’ he summarized.
 

Even outdoors, track continues domination

 

By JIM LAKE
Staff Reporter

 

Following right on the heels of a
championship indoor season, the
Washington and Lee track team has

" already won two outdoor meets. In
the first, a dual meet last Saturday at
Wilson Field, the Generals blew

' away Roanoke College, 99-43. In the

. Second, a four-team meet in
Bridgewater Tuesday afternoon, the

' Generals were just as successful,

, Tolling over Bridgewater, Heidelberg
and Eastern Mennonite.

Against Roanoke, W&L won 11 of

, the day’s 17 events and took second
place in 14, giving the Generals more

' than enough points to coast to an easy

_ Victory. In fact, W&L swept five
events, taking all three places in the

: long jump, javelin, shot, pole vault,
and discus.

' The Generals were led by junior
John White, who won the triple jump
and the 400 meters, and by junior An-

‘drew White, who took first place in

, both the 110 and 400-meter hurdles.

In the field events, senior John

' Burlingame won the long jump, and

, Senior Thomas Murray took first

place in the shot put. Sophomore Jim

Ambrosini won the discus, and junior

Joseph Fisher took first in the pole
vault.

Spring is finally here and that
means two things, girls in shorts and
’ 18 holes at your local golf course. Un-
, fortunately for the Washington and
Lee golf team, getting in that crucial
time on the links has been somewhat
of a problem.
The Generals placed third out of
‘five teams in yesterday’s round-
robin tournament in Staunton and
18th out of 24 in this past weekend’s
James Madison Spring Invitational.
Not great, but according to head
coach Buck Leslie, all the team needs
is more time on the course in order to
iron out its wrinkles.
“I was pretty pleased,” Leslie
said. “Allin all it wasn’t that bad. We
, just need to get more work in.
“That week [of warm tempera-
tures] was really the only good week
» of work we were able to get in. We
lost another day on Monday because
- of the snow.”’
In the round-robin tournament,
, Which featured only Old Dominion
Athletic Conference teams, W&L was
* led by junior Gary Campbell who

Boyd, who won the 100-meter dash in
11.8 seconds, and the Generals’ 400-
meter relay team, which took first
with a time of 46.1 seconds.

Tuesday afternoon in Harrison-
burg, the Generals scored 80 points,
taking first place in eight events.
Heidelberg College, a Division III
school and a member of the Ohio
Athletic Conference, finished a dis-
tant second with 50 points. “We ran a
really good meet,” said head coach
Norris Aldridge. ‘The times were
really good for a meet this early in
the year.”

Looking at the sprints, “Kevin
Weaver and Wes Boyd both ran well
in the 100 and 200 meters,” said
Aldridge. Boyd took second place in
the 100 with a time of 11.2 seconds,
and Weaver finished in 11.5 seconds
and placed fourth in the same event.
In the 200, Boyd’s time of 23.4 seconds
was good enough for second place,
and Weaver finished right behind
him at 23.8 seconds.

Once again, Andrew White won
both hurdle events. He finished the
110 high hurdles in 15.3 seconds and
the 400 intermediate hurdles in 59.8
seconds. John White took second
place in the 400 meters with a time of
52.3 seconds, his fastest time ever in
that event.

In the distance events, junior
Richard Moore won the 1500 meters
in 4:08, ‘‘one of his faster 1500 times,”’
according to Aldridge. Moore also

shot an 80 (38-42), senior co-captain
Mark Zavatsky (82), junior John
Gammage (83) and sophomore Pete
Coleman (83). The General’s total of
328 was 10 strokes behind winner
Bridgewater and trailed only 2nd-
place Roanoke by three.

The JMU invitational saw W&L
tied for tenth after the first day, but
some shaky play in the second round
cost the team a higher finish.

‘‘We had four players on the verge
of having [second] rounds in the
70’s,” Leslie said. “The course
played awfully tough and a lot of the
teams were coming up from the
warmer weather down South.

“That second day really left a bad
taste in my mouth.”

The reason for Leslie’s displeasure
was the fact the Generals held a
seven-stroke advantage over Lynch-
burg after round one, only to end up a
full ten strokes behind, 658-668, after
round two. W&L, however, did finish
ahead of three other ODAC teams;
Hampden-Sydney, Randolph-Macon
and Bridgewater.

The Generals next match is the
Ferrum Invitational in Ferrum, S.C.
on Friday.

MILEPOSTS:The total scores of
Tuesday’s meet at Bridgewater:
W&L 80, Heidelberg 50, Bridgewater
48, and Eastern Mennonite 3.... Next
week’s meet at Liberty University
has been cancelled. Instead,
Aldridge said that “about 14 or 15
people”’ will make the trip down to
the Hampton University Relays. The
Generals next full meet will be held
Tuesday afternoon at Wilson Field
against Eastern Mennnonite and
Newport News Apprentice College...

“IT was as pleased with the
Swarthmore game as I was with the
Ohio Wesleyan game,” said Daly.

“Ohio Wesleyan showed us what
our capabilities were, and Swarth-
more showed us we could be consis-
tent. Our starters were totally
prepared for the game mentally, and
when the reserves got in, they played
a super game.”

“There was no drop in intensity,”’
said Daly. “No peak for Ohio Wes-
leyan and then a dropoff.

“That’s what made me feel so good
about the game. We played as a
team.

“T can’t say enough about our two
assistants,’ continued Daly. ‘Bill
Pilat and Brian Corrigan are doing a
great job getting the kids ready for
the games.”’

Guess what. The tournament has dropped into our lives again and,
as usual, it has brought pageantry, hype, and excitement with it.

Now, I must admit, the closest I’ve ever come to the actual tourna-
ment was when it was played in Philadelphia. Then, at least I could
say that I was in the same state as the Final Four.

And, the only time I’ve ever really had enough interest in a team to
follow it throughout the entire tournament was when Villanova won it
all in 1985.

But all this doesn’t mean that I can’t see how exciting it is for the
students of a particular school to have their team participating in the
tournament.

I’ve always wished that I could be a part of one of those rowdy
crowds you always see at Duke or Kansas. The fans there are cheering
for their team. Booing the opposing team. Yelling at the officials.
Generally having a great time.

Well now I may get the opportunity.

This year the University is fielding a team, in a major spectator
sport, that has a legitimate chance to compete for the National Cham-
pionship.

I’m talking about, of course, the lacrosse team.

I know that there have been other teams in W&L’s recent history
that have competed for the National Title, and they have every right to
be proud of themselves, as the University should be proud of them. But
this is the first time in at least five years that one of the more popular
sports has mounted a serious run at the NCAA Championship Tourna-
ment, and people are noticing.

People ask me where the Generals are ranked nationally. When
their next game is. What I think of their chances. There is a genuine
excitement about one of our sports teams.

And, all of this interest was spurred by a long overdue decision made
by the Trustees last spring—the decision to change lacrosse to Divi-
sion III status.

I’m sure most of you know the story, but for the benefit of those
who’ve been living in a cave for the past year, here’s the abridged ver-
sion.

The lacrosse team, which used to be the school’s only Division I pro-
gram, had suffered through four straight losing seasons. The problem,
as almost everyone saw it, was that, without scholarships, the team
just couldn’t compete with the Division I powerhouses anymore.

There were several ways to change the situation, but the only solu-
tion that would have restored W&L to lacrosse prominence without
compromising the academic integrity of the University was the drop
in divisional status. The rest, as they say, is history. Well, maybe not
quite history.

Last year, I think it was Mike Stachura, then Sports Editor of the
Phi, who said, ‘‘A winning program at any level breeds excitement.”’
The change in student’s attitudes brought on by the change in the
classification of W&L lacrosse certainly proves him right.

The difference between this year and last is striking. There are
more fans at the games, and, more importantly, a higher percentage
of those fans are actually there to see the game.

Now, of course I couldn’t prove any of that but I just have a different
feeling about the lacrosse games this year than I did last year. Instead
of looking for bright spots in close General’s losses, I’m seeing the
team win the tight games. Instead of watching people filing out of the
stadium at the half, I’m noticing more and more people sticking
around to watch the fat lady sing.

There is student interest in athletics at W&L, it just took the right
team in the right situation to bring it out. It will be two weeks until the
first regular season Division III poll comes out, and there’s no
guarantee that W&L will even be ranked highly, but just the fact that
we're waiting for it says something.

Like W&L Sports Information Director Mark Mandel said, “It’s
been a long time since anyone around here has been interested in
polls.’’

Poetics keep up reputation

 

By BRAD SHAW
Special To The Phi

 

Allow me to wax nostalgic. Almost
three years ago, I watched an
obscure little band play in a small
bar to a packed house. It was the first
time I had ever seen or heard of Wax-
ing Poetics, and it was one of the best
live performances by any band that I
had ever seen.

A hefty reputation tends to latch on
to a band that makes such a memora-
ble first impression, and Waxing
Poetics is no exception. They have
proven to audiences all over the East
Coast that when you book the
Poetics, you'll get your money’s
worth. Crowds have been known to
scream for so many encores that the
band had to start playing some songs
for a second time in one night.

Several weeks ago, the Poetics
released their long-awaited debut
album, Hermitage. It would have been
easy for Waxing Poetics to simply
recreate that well-known live at-
mosphere in each song on the new
LP. Instead, with the help of pro-
ducers Mitch Easter and Mike Mills
(of R.E.M.), the Poetics have shaved
down, refined and refurbished eleven
of their own songs to create one of
this year’s best albums.

Easter and Mills have added a lit-
tle something to each song on
Hermitage to make it instrumentally
more complex than its live version.
Tampering with a song that sounds
great live can often result in gaudy,
pretentious trimming, ruining the
band’s reputation. (Just look at the
Alarm) Easter and Mills, however,
have made changes to the Poetic’s
songs that sound as if they should
have been part of the songs all along,
and leave the nuances that tell you
this album in Waxing Poetics the
first time you hear it.

Stallone is just an arm-wrestling Rambo

By MICHABL TUGGLE
Movie Critic

Sylvester Stallone has made quite
a name for himself as Hollywood’s
new tough guy on the block. In the
past decade he has either beaten or
destroyed the world boxing cham-
pion (twice), Mr. T., the Russians,
the Vietnamese, the Germans, and a
small northern town. While it is
doubtful that Stallone will ever reach
the ‘‘stud’”’ status that John Wayne
and Clint Eastwood have attained, he
still gets an E for effort. His new
film, Over The Top, adds the World
Arm Wrestling Championship to the
Conquered list, but unfortunately
does little else. Instead of a rich
movie, all we get is a rehashed rags
to riches Rocky plot involving father
and son.

Stallone portrays Lincoln Hawkes,
a truck driver/arm
wrestler/runaway father. The film

David Middleton's lead vocals
have weathered the transition to
vinyl well throughout the record and
the backing vocals have made a vast
improvement. Paul Tiers shreds his
guitar on most of the songs with
Peter Buck-esque impunity and Bil
Shearin’s drumwork has clearly
stepped out of the shadows. The most
impressive performance is logged in
by Sean Hennessy and his thwapping
bass. The bass line in ‘‘Hermitage’’
drives the song as if it had its own
heart and his plucking on ‘‘Distine-
tion’’ makes your whole body feel
like twitching

The LP captures your attention
from the very beginning. The
acoustic intro to the album’s first
song, ‘“‘Beauty and the Beatitudes”’
explodes into Tiers’ wailing guitar
and you’re hooked. From that point,
the album doesn’t slow down until
“Friday's Child,” then immediately
cranks up again with “Distinction.”
Side two keeps up the pace with
“Walking on Thin Legs,’’ which
reminds one a little of R.E.M.’s ‘‘We
Walk” without sounding anything
like it. Ironically, one of the best
songs on the album is one that few
have heard live. The last song, ‘‘A
Year By Air,” is an excellent, haun-
ting tune that would be at home on
side two of Abbey Road, yet has not
been included in many of the poetic’s
live performances.

Hermitage is an album whose alter-
native sound seems to have gained
acceptance throughout Virginia and
North Carolina and is even appearing
on college radio playlists as far north
as New York. It has been released on
compact disc, and there is even talk
of a video for “If You Knew Sushi.”
All of the recent attention given to
Waxing Poetics has not gone to their
heads, though. I saw them about a
week ago and they still had to play a
few songs twice.

military school commencement at
the request of the boy’s mother.
Hawke’s left the boy and her when
the child was a baby but has kept in
touch with her over the years and
now obeys her request to make peace

the entire situation is the rich, ar-
rogant grandfather who lives for con-

everything in his power to keep the

reject him. However, there has to be

cares? This is a Stallone flick,

the Russians or the Vietnamese, who
can Stallone single-handedly topple

The answer: The World Arm

Over The Top really tries hard to be
a sincere film about unbreakable
love and the quest for the gold, but
really: haven’t we seen this a million
times before? Perhaps his ‘“‘exper-
tise’”’ in this type of film is what con-
tinually lands him in these roles. Or
maybe it is the frighteningly large
number of faithful who line up at the
box office every time the guy’s name
winds up on the marquee. At any
rate, Over The Top simply does not

“We have to talk about things that

are sometimes embarrassing,” said
* Dr. Richard Keeling, chairman of the
Task Force on AIDS for the
American College Health Associa-
* tion.
AIDS is one of those things.
Keeling told a large Lee Chapel
t audience last Thursday night that
risk groups don’t matter anymore,
risk behavior does.
> On a risk scale, with 1.0 equalling
no risk, Keeling gave risk factors for
sexual practices commonly associ-

Passive anal sex carries a risk fac-
tor of 2.1, while active anal sex car-
' ries a risk factor of 1.3. Combined ac-
, tive and passive practices carry a

risk factor of 2.5.

of transmission of the AIDS virus,
but the virus is not limited to the
‘ homosexual community.

risk. Any risk it carries is heighten-
ed, he said, during the woman’s men-
strual period.

Keeling distinguished between
casual kissing and deep kissing, with
casual kissing carrying no risk. The
problem with deep kissing, Keeling
said, is how to tell ‘when kissing
becomes deep.’’

He added that deep kissing is like
nausea. ‘‘You know it when you have

After discussing risk factors Keel-
ing spoke of more ideological issues.
He said it is important not to think of
AIDS as a moral agent, nor as a
“Tightning bolt from Lynchburg,”’ as
some people think of it, referring to

 

the Rev. Jerry Falwell. AIDS, Keel-
ing said, is ‘‘an accident of history.”
Keeling explained that people can
have the virus for up to 10 years
without experiencing any effects.
The age group with the most number
of AIDS cases is the 30-39 year old
group. With the incubation period
lasting up to 10 years, many in that
age group contracted the disease
during their young adulthood.

The sicker the virus makes people,
the less likely they are to spread the
virus. Conversely, Keeling said,
those who are infected with AIDS and
do not show any symptoms are usual-
ly unaware they have the disease and
are therefore more likely to spread
AIDS.

Court dismisses
VMI cadets’ cases

 

By SAMUEL FOLEY
Staff Reporter

 

Four of the six Virginia Military In-
stitute cadets arrested for disorderly
conduct after a brawl at the Phi Kap-
pa Psi fraternity house on March 1
have had their cases dismissed in
Lexington’s General District Court.

Cadets Raphael Barsamian,
Michael Balao, William Cario and
Allan Stoneman had their cases
dismissed Tuesday afternoon
because according to Judge Joseph
E. Hess, ‘‘There has to be more than
presence at an unlawful gathering
for there to be a charge for disorderly
conduct.”

Judge Hess said that the cadets
have been charged with failure to
disperse, but there was no cause for a
charge of disorderly conduct.

Cadet Pablo Antonio Martinez, who
chose not to have an attorney, pled
guilty to the charge of disorderly con-
duct and was fined $25.

Staff Reporter

 

Although the size of the average
class section at Washington and
Lee has remained stable at 15 the
past two years, there has been a
slight increase in the number of
classes with more than 30 stu-
dents.

According to figures provided
by University Registrar D. Scott
Dittman, the winter term increase
is nearly 3 percent over last year.
Dittman added, however, that
there was a dropoff in the number
of sections with 31 to 40 students
last year, and that figures from
the previous year indicate the in-
crease actually could be closer to
one percent. He could not explain
last year’s dropoff.

Dean of the College John Elrod
attributes increases in class size
to three things: the General
Education Requirements, a high-
er total credit requirement than in

 

The charges stemmed from an in-
cident that occurred on the evening
of March 1. Two cadets were denied
entrance to a party at the Phi Psi
house and said they were beaten
after identifying themselves as VMI
cadets.

They returned to the barracks and
word of what happened spread. A
group of approximately 75 cadets left
the post and proceeded to Phi Psi.

Sergeant T. H. Pedersen, in his
testimony at the trial, said that the
cadets were, ‘Running and jogging
in a very defined column. Several of
them had their hands taped to protect
their knuckles.”’

The group of cadets circled around
the back of the fraternity house and
were met by several members of the
fraternity. The police were on the
scene and were trying to keep the two
groups apart.

According to Capt. Harold Will-
cockson, the deputy commandant,
none of the approximately 75 cadets
who were at the scene, besides those
that were arrested, received any
punishment. ‘‘We couldn’t find them

the past, and a higher than op-
timal number of history pro-
fessors on leave thisterm. >

Indeed, a January 20 memo
from Dittman to Elrod shows one-
fourth of the sections with more
than 40 students are in the history
department, and this term three
history professors are on leave of
absence.

Also, since 1984 the University
has required students to graduate
with 121 rather than 115 credits.

Elrod further noted that while
the former distribution credit
system required students to take
only about one-quarter of their
classes for distribution, the
General Education Requirements
make up more than one-third of a
student’s credit load. With more
students required to take specific
classes, Elrod said, those classes
will tend to increase in size.

Elrod said the administration is
concerned that increased class
size will mean decreased stu-

and couldn’t identify them so we
couldn’t do anything to them,’ he
said.

These cadets managed to return to
post without being seen by guards
who had been placed on duty with
orders to identify cadets who were
trying to sneak back in. None were
caught.

Phi Psi president John McDonald
said he was upset by the decision and
that Phi Psi now has a policy pro-
hibiting cadets from their parties.
“Just as long as they understand
they can’t come back. They ruined it
for everyone else over there.”’

Interfraternity Council President
and Phi Psi member Chris Saxman
was very annoyed with the decision.
“You have got to be kidding me!
That is absolutely ridiculous! They
come over to our house and do that? I
can’t believe they got off.”’

Six cadets and one Washington and
Lee student were arrested. The two
remaining cases, W&L junior
Michael McEvoy and cadet Brand-
ner Lawrence, will be heard April 28.

dent/teacher interaction. But, he
added, the administration is look-
ing into ways to maintain such in-
teraction.

Another administration concern
is how the planned increase in the
undergraduate student population
from the current 1428 to a max-
imum of 1500 will affect the stu-
dent/teacher ration. Ideally,
Elrod said, the University would
like to maintain close to a 10-1
ratio.

Increased class sizes and the ex-
pected increase in the student
body over the next few years
could be offset by increasing the
number of professors. Elrod,
University President John Wilson
and Associate Dean of the College
H. Thomas Williams currently are
meeting with departmental repre-
sentatives to discuss questions
such as class size and office

Financial aid
is threatened

By MARIE DUNNE
Editorial Page Editor

 

 

 

 

 

Students who have student loans
may no longer be eligible for those
loans due to changes in federal laws,
said John DeCourcy, director of
financial aid for undergraduates at
Washington and Lee University.

In October of 1986 Congress
reauthorized the higher education
bill of 1965 and enacted several key
changes to the bill.

“Congress made some very signifi-
cant changes as to who can get aid
and who can’t and their status, and it
made changes beginning in January
of ’87, in other words in the middle of
anacadamic year,” said DeCourcy.

The biggest change concerns the
Guaranteed Student Loan program.
Previously, families that made less
than $30,000 a year could borrow
their estimated contribution to their
education expenses rather than take
it out of their own pocket, said
DeCourcy.

Students find out what their
estimated contribution should be for
each year by filling out a Financial
Aid Form and sending to the College
Service in Princeton. After eval-
uating the financial information sup-
plied by the student and the family,
the College Service states how much
the family can afford to put toward
educational costs.

Because of the recent changes in
the financial aid regulations, no
students may borrow their estimated

contribution through a Guaranteed
Student Loan, said DeCourcy.
Guaranteed Student Loans are still
available to students to cover educa-
tional expenses that exceed their
estimated contribution.

“(Families) made an educated
decision. They sat down and com-
pared costs and whatnot and
methods of payment, and said, ‘okay,
we can handle W&L.’ Now all of a
sudden the GSL rug has been pulled
right out from underneath them,”
said DeCourcy.

DeCourcy believes the changes in
financial aid regulations may affect
student enrollment.

“T think because of costs we've
always had trouble competing (with
other schools), and this just makes
that gap wider,” said DeCourcy.

Fortunately, some students who do
qualify for Guaranteed Student
Loans will de eligible to receive more
money in loans, because the loan
limits went up, said DeCourcy.

Students who are under 24 and
make less than $4,000 a year will
automatically be considered depen-
dents of their parents even if they
support themselves and do not live at
home, according to the new financial
aid rules.

DeCourcy said many students,
especially law students, are finding
their status changing from indepen-
dent to dependent and vice versa

‘‘What this means is that we’ve had
people change status in the middle of

OPINION
Help?

The government has done it again.

The changes in financial aid regulations has made an
already difficult system impossible.

Under the changes, some students who supported them-
selves are being declared dependents of their parents.

Students previously eligible for Guaranteed Student Loans
are no longer able to count on such loans.

The banks sponsoring the loans are being told by the
government that after a few years, interest rates on in-
dividual loans will change. Loans under one interest rate will
automatically change to another interest rate. This will
Cause major problems in paperwork for the banks, and many
banks will no longer be a part of the Guaranteed Student
Loan program, making loans harder for students to get.

The timing of the changes is another questionable move of
the government. The changes came into effect halfway
through an academic year. Students eligible for loans in one
half of the year may not be eligible in the second half.
Students independent during the fall semester may be con-
sidered dependent during the winter and spring terms.

Why? Congress seems eager to crack down on students
who manipulate the financial aid system in order to get loans
and aid, when they can afford to pay for college.

However, in the making the system tougher to cheat, Con-
gress has made financial aid unavailable to students who
need it.

Congress needs to cut it’s expenditures. But to cut financial
aid programs outright would cause a flurry of lobbying and
public outcry, and would prompt time-consuming arguing.

So instead of cutting the programs, Congress makes finan-
cial aid so difficult to receive and the application process so
confusing that students (especially students applying to com-
munity colleges or state universities) will forget about col-
lege before they wade through the mountain of paperwork in-
volved. Thus, funds for financial aid may not be used.

Conceivably, 20 years from now when there is a shortage of
people with college degrees, the government will criticize to-
day’s leaders for making financial aid difficult to receive.

However, that isn’t much comfort for the student strug-
gling to pay college costs today.

Jim and Tammy
prayin’ for pennies

 

MY VIEW

By Jeff Kelsey

 

The massive invasion of television
into the American living room since
the 1950s has produced audiovisual
classics alongside the worst artistic
endeavors civilization has ever seen.
But we realize the fact that not all
television can be good television, so
we accept impeccably bad shows like
“Silver Spoons,”’ ‘‘BJ and the Bear,”
“The Dukes of Hazzard”’ and “The A
Team” as long as we get a weekly fix
of “Cheers,” “‘MASH”’ or ‘Monday
Night Football.”

But without a doubt one of the
worst results of this age of mass com-
munication has been the TV evan-
gelist. That never-ending procession
of Billy Bob Smiths who announce in
a Southern twang, “Friends, I had a
vision last night. And the vision came
unto me and said Billy Bob raise me
some money. So, I ask you to send me
your money.”’ Most of the time these
modern-day prophets don’t even war-
rant consideration, but lately they
have succeeded in gaining my atten-
tion, if not in prayer then at least ina
good laugh.

Let’s take for example Jim and
Tammy Faye Bakker (pronounced
ba’ker, as in rolling in dough),
founders of the Praise The Lord Club
(PTL). In case you are not familiar
with Jim and Tammy, I’ll give a brief
description. Jim, well he’s pretty
much your typical yuppie evangelist
while Tammy has a lot of blond hair

and even more mascara that even-
tually ends up on her face because
she invariably cries on every show.

Anyway the PTL was running
along like a greased pig at a county
fair, pulling in around $130 million
per year. Not bad for a non-profit
organization. Jim’s latest project, a
$10 million ‘‘Water Slide for God’’
(a.ka. Heritage USA) had just been
completed and Jim and Tammy’s
his-and-her Mercedes were just back
from the shop and purring like kit-
tens. But, alas, all good things must
come to an end and Jim and Tam-
my’s world came crashing down. Jim
was forced to resign his position as
head of PTL to Jerry Falwell be-
cause of some undisclosed sexual im-
proprieties. Tammy Faye admitted
an addiction to prescription medica-
tion and checked into a rehab.

Now, I’m not one to gloat over
another man’s misfortune, but let’s
look at this ridiculous situation. Here
is a man who for years has gotten
rich through a form of spiritual
blackmail, and whose victims are
mostly the poor or elderly who can-
not afford to lose any of their income.
Things would be bad enough if Jim
were simply a con artist type, like a
modern day Elmer Gantry, but he
probably really has good intentions
so the term hypocrite seems ap-
propriate. The whole scene really is
ludicrous: this so-called man of God
guilty of sexual misconduct and his
wife a drug addict. It seems obvious
that P.T. Barnum’s addage ‘‘No one
ever lost money underestimating the
intelligence of the American public”
still holds true. Only in America.
“Praise the Lord.”’

Computer registration creates correctable problems

 

three classes. The margin for error is
much smaller then.

The first big problem with the
system was that too many students
felt they had to line-up excessively
early and skip classes to get the
schedules they wanted. Look here,
this is registration, not a rock concert

MY VIEW —
By Jennifer Spreng

 

I think the new On-Line registra-

 

 

tion system is good. I’m not going to
pretend that it worked perfectly, and
no one should have expected it to do
so. One of the cruel truisms of data
processing is that no system works
properly the first few times it is used.

However, just because computeriz-
ing scheduling may be well-advised
in the long run doesn’t mean that the
system as used for Spring term
registration is satisfactory. There
are at least 3 changes that will have
to be made, or registration for Fall
and Winter next year could get really
out of hand. After all, Spring term is
relatively simple, because most
students only register for two or

ticket line! If students feel they must
miss class to register, the system is
wrong. That type of first-come-first-
served system gives enormous ad-
vantage to students who take only
afternoon classes, especially if those
morning classes have attendance re-
quirements. I also have to question
any University policy that en-
courages class-cutting.

This problem wouldn’t be difficult
to solve. All the registrar’s office
would have to do is to schedule
registration for times when there are
no classes — like a couple Saturdays,
or four evenings from 7:00 to 11:00.

EDITORIAL COMMENT

The Midwest is known as the breadbasket of the United
States because it provides much of the nation’s food. It also
provides Washington and Lee with a large number of its aa-
ministrators.

Shari Anderson, W&L’s new director of personnel, joins a
long line of administrators, including Deans Elrod and Pep-
pers, University Librarian Barbara Brown and last, but cer-
tainly not least, the president of the University himself, com-
ing to W&L from the Midwest.

Surely this influx of midwesterners is a coincidence. But if
the University wants a diverse community, the best place to
start is with the administration. —JFP

registered after lunch anyway, so
three or four hours could probably
get each class registered.

The second problem is that too
many students had to spend upwards
of two hours waiting in line. I’ll grant
that computerization probably saved
the Registrar’s office staff unbe-
lievable amounts of time, but I can’t
believe that the student body didn’t
waste between ten and twenty times
more just standing in line. What does
it matter whose time is being used,
anyway? Time is time, and too much
got wasted during Spring registra-
tion.

That problem becomes worse if
you imagine Fall term registration.
The terminal operators will take
longer to prepare each schedule,
because there will be physically
more to key and print. Unless several
more terminals are added for the
Fall, registration will become a

Black Hole for everyone’s time.

The third problem probably
bothered students who encountered it
more than any other disadvantage of
the new system. I want to preface
this by saying that I realize that not
every student can take every class he
wants, even at a _ school like
Washington and Lee. I also realize
that classes close.

However, this Spring term, too
many classes closed! Worse yet,
after some students changed their
plans new sections opened leaving
those students in the cold.

This problem was exacerbated by
the fact that the majority of the
students getting hosed were
freshmen because the new system
makes them register last. Freshmen
have a problem Spring term, because
they are severly limited in the course
offerings from which they can pick.

They can’t take upper division

courses, because often they don’t
have the prerequisites or class stand-
ing. Potential Commerce School ma-
jors are discouraged from taking too
many courses there until they are
sophomores or juniors. Most in-
troductory courses in the sciences,
mathmatics, fine arts, and numerous
other areas just aren’t offered Spring
term.

Juniors and seniors whodon’t get
the classes they want ‘can dip down
and take 100 and 200 level classes.
Then they push freshmen and sopho-
mores out of the only courses they
can take.

A two-pronged partial solution does
exist, based on the first-come-first-
served concept. Students ought to
have the option to sign ‘waiting
lists” after they register in case new
sections of closed classes open, or
other students drop. This way every
student will have a schedule when he

 

leaves registration, but if the classes -
aren’t his top choices he has a chance
of getting the ones he wants if they
open.

The second part of the solution is to:
offer a limited drop-add period
before the term closes. That way
students who lack credits or are on
waiting lists can settle those pro-
blems early so that students wishing .
to change classes for more caprici-
ous reasons don’t bump them.
This will also take some of the in-
evitable hassle from the Registrar’s .
office out of drop-add week, and they
can solve the serious problems early.

I feel sorry that I abused the
system here, because I like it. I like
being able to pick the sections of a
course I take. Also the computer is
ultimately likely to be more accurate ,
and efficient in the future. However,
in the meantime we have to live with
it, and we should make it as painless .
as possible.

 

“In last week’s issue of the Ring-tum Phi, a letter from three
undergraduates, C. Martin, J. Missert, and T. Bullotta, responded to a Fan-
cy Dress article in the Law Review.

A sentence mistakenly read ‘‘We feel that a 3rd year law student, would
have watched to the extent that blatent rascism, name calling, and
shallowness could be disguished a little better.” The sentence should have
read ‘‘that a 3rd year law student would have matured to the extent...’’ The

Gentlemen,

As I consider what John D. Wilson and the
Board of Trustees have done to this university in
recent years, I get furious and sad. Then I
wonder when their madness will end.

When faced with a declining applicant pool, the
Board of Trustees took the easy way out and
turned to coeducation, instead of undertaking
more aggressive recruiting efforts. They knew
that by becoming ‘‘mainstream’’ they would in-
crease the applicant pool. In doing so, they
overlooked the tragic costs which they would in-
cur.
It used to be that a W&L grad was easily
distinguishable from a UVA grad, a Williams
grad, or anybody else for that matter. What set
him apart from those other men? First and
foremost he lived by Robert E. Lee’s code of
gentlemanly conduct. This key underlying prin-
ciple was instilled in him during his years at
Washington and Lee. Judging from Standard and
Poor’s poll, W&L also instilled in him the for-
mula for success. Those W&L alumni who put us
in the number eight position of corporate and
business leaders were obviously products of an
all-male W&L. They were the well-rounded
gentlemen that this university produced in years
gone by.

It seems as if Wilson and the Board of Trustees
have decided that to focus on the well-rounded
graduate, both academically and socially, is a
thing of the past. To educate in such a manner
would be to alienate W&L from the mainstream
of American colleges. Is that so bad? President
Wilson, clear your mind of SAT scores and a vi-
sionary nationalized W&L for a moment and
TRY to give me one good reason why W&L
should not preserve its uniqueness and endeavor
to produce the well-rounded W&L Gentleman of
the past.

Juniors and Seniors, many of you have noticed
the drastic changes in the average individual in
the incoming classes. Some of them would be at
home in our classes, but many of them would be
much more at home at a state school. At the rate
these changes are going, the only significant dif-
ference between W&L and schools like UVA will
be size. Is that in the best interest of the universi-
ty? I think not. We may have increased our SAT
scores, but look at the average graduate of the
future and tell me that R.E. Lee would have been
proud to call them Washington and Lee Gentle-
men.

 

 

LETTERS

I still believe that the W&L Gentleman can be
brought back to this campus, even if John D.
Wilson does not understand or approve of such
individuals. The first step towards restoring this
is to phase out coeducation. The second step is
for the Admissions Office to clear their heads of
excessive SAT scores and foolish visionary goals
of a national drawing pool (if potential W&L
gents are residing in the West or even the North,
they will find us.) And finally, we must whole-
heartedly embrace the concept of fraternal
renaissance. No longer can we _ tolerate
ungentlemanly behavior within our fraternity
houses. We, as members of the student body,
must take the initiative to restore Lee’s code of
gentlemanly conduct.

For those of you gentlemen who still believe in
the ideals of the Traditional W&L, you will be
presented with a tremendous opportunity begin-
ning this Thursday at 8:00 p.m. in the Co-op,
where you may add your signature to the petition
demanding that the Board of Trustees phase out
coeducation completely by June of 1991.

Sincerely,

Richard B. Robins, Jr.
All-Male W&L ’88

Prejudices are ungentlemanly

An open letter to the men of Washington and
Lee:

I am outraged by the treatment Ms. Pierson
received as a candidate for Secretary of the Ex-
ecutive Committee. The attacks against her
gender were both unfair and in bad taste. In light
of the events of the election, I must commend
Ms. Pierson for the strength she demonstrated,
and I sincerely hope that she and others will not
be discouraged from pursuing elective office in
the future.

Just because we are no longer an all-male in-
stitution does not excuse us of our obligation to
conduct ourselves as gentlemen. Whether we
agreed with coeducation or not, the fact is that
women have been here since 1985, and are here
to stay. As students of Washington and Lee, they
are entitled to the same privileges we would

Robins calls for return of all-male W&L

claim for ourselves — including the right to be
judged on the basis of merit. In 1987, gender,
ethnic background, or religious creed should
never be considered as a qualification for
holding any office or attaining any honor on this
campus. To taint our judgements of others with
petty prejudices is an insult to ourselves as in-
dividuals and our community as a whole.

While I have been informed that the cry for a
return to the days when “‘men-were-men-and-
women-were-here-for-the-weekend”’ emanates
solely from a ‘‘vocal minority’’ of students, the
“silent majority’ has been silent for too long.
Certainly we feel threatened and alienated by
the attention the women have received from the
administration, as a child feels threatened upon
the arrival of a newborn baby — but we are no
longer children. If, indeed, we are men and our
love for this university and the virtues of honor it
represents are more than just rhetoric, our
challenge is to extend our hands in friendship to
our women classmates and welcome them as
members of this community to make coeduca-
tion work. It is a challenge we must accept, for a
“house divided against itself cannot stand.”’

Sincerely,

Michael D. Webb

Black history exhibit featured

To the Editors:

While I greatly appreciate Dana Bolden’s
remarks in last week’s Ring-tum Phi about the
exhibit ‘Don’t Grieve After Me’’ which was at
the University Library February 20 - March 10, I
would like to point out that the most exciting ex-
hibit and the one which required the most work
to put together, ‘‘Lexington’s Black Communi-

“One of the tradeoffs students
make in coming to a liberal arts
school like Washington and Lee is
that they don’t get as much exposure
to the field as they would at a more
specialized, business-oriented
undergraduate  school,’’ said
Goldsten. ‘‘This group offers
students the chance to expand their
financial base in an academic set-
ting, which could well prove advan-
tageous to them down the road.”’

Goldsten added that such a group
would help students develop a career
focus within a financial framework.
“Many students interested in the
field of finance are just not aware of
the many dimensions of the field,
having not explored their posbibili-
ties. While banking is an excellent
way to enter the field, for instance, it
is by no means the only option
available to students,’ Goldsten
said.

Several years ago, says Goldsten, a
commerce fraternity was formed
that met once a month, inviting
speakers to talk to students on an in-
formal basis. “A student-run FMA
chapter here could be run in a similar
fashion, serving as a forum for the

tioned the recent interest in the area
of mergers and acquisitions as an ex-
ample of a topic not in the school’s
curriculum which, given sufficient
student interest, could be addressed
by the group.

Field trips are another possibility,
Goldsten said. ‘‘Interesting, local ex-
cursions could easily be arranged
Which would hopefully enhance the
professional insights of students in-
volved.’’

The formation of an investment
club would also be possible through
the group. According to Goldsten,
such clubs exist nationwide, and are
highly successful in themselves and
in nationwide investment competi-
tions.

But perhaps the greatest asset
such a program would produce would

Four students avoid run-offs

 

By MARGARET PIMBLETT
Staff Reporter

 

Four students were clear winners
in Monday’s class elections and did
not participate in today’s run-off.

Sophomore Chris deMovellan and
junior Brandt Wood were both re-
elected to the Executive Committee
with a majority of the votes cast.

DeMovellan received 167 of the 301
votes cast by the class of 1989, while
Wood received 123 of the 143 votes of
the class of 1988.

Juniors Mike Henry and Doug
Elliot were re-elected a second time
to their positions of class president
and vice president, respectively.

Henry defeated Norm Sigler by
nearly six votes to one, while Elliot

received 121 votes. Although 212
ballots were cast by rising seniors,
there were 152 no-votes for vice presi-
dent.

Three vice presidents are elected
for the senior class. The four can-
didates in the run-off for the remain-
ing two spots are Richard Norris,
Tommy McBride, David Jordan and
Ted Willard.

The closest race was for vice presi-
dent of the class of 1989. David Burns
led with 55 votes, while Lucy Ander-
son and Hugh McCormick tied with
52. All three were in today’s run-off.

Sophomore Mike Caroll missed the
run-off by one vote, with 51 votes.

The run-off candidates for Ex-
ecutive Committee representative
were Tom O’Brien and Mike Suttle
for the remaining senior position,

Wright Ledbetter and John Mc-
Donough for the second junior slot,
and Chris Giblin, Jud Parker, Mary
Alice McMorrow and Thomas
Sheehan for the two sophomore
representative spots.

Scott Jules, this year’s freshman
E.C. representative, did not receive
enough votes to enter the run-off.

The presidential candidates in the
run-off were Richard Zuber and Billy
Tunner for the rising sophomore
class, and Jim Ambrosini and Mike
Forrester in the rising junior class.

Freshmen Chris Pennewill and
Mason Van Sciver entered the run-off
for rising sophomore vice president.

A total of 910 votes were cast Mon-
day — 316 freshmen, 382 sophomores,
and 212 juniors.

the academic year,” said DeCourcy
of the financial aid law, which took
effect in January. :

DeCourcy said many problems
were created when the changes took
effect halfway through the academic
year.

“It was pretty difficult figuring out
how to deal with this thing in the mid-
dle of the year. It’s a profound
change of rules in mid-stream,”’ said
DeCourcy.

DeCourcy explained that the
government is not giving financial

aid directors any specific directions
or clarifications on the changes in
financial aid regulations.

“The government is really hanging
back on giving us any guidance on
(the changes in regulations),” said
DeCourcy. ‘‘They usually run six to
nine months behind in terms of
clarification, in my experience.”

DeCourcy said the changes in the
financial aid regulations have
noticeably affected law students, but
he doesn’t really expect the changes
to hit undergraduates until next
academic year.

Another impact of the new regula-
tions are changes in the actual Finan-
cial Aid Forms. Combined with last
year new verification program, this
results in a tremendous increase in
paperwork for financial aid offices
and recipients.

The new tax laws passed last year
include the potential for more
changes in the financial aid regula-
tions. Previously, financial aid direc-
tors governed the formula by which a
student is judged in need of aid.
Through the new tax laws, Congress
now decides the needs-analysis for
mula. What was formerly decided by
the financial aid community is now
subject to lobbying, said DeCourcy.

DeCourcy stresses that while some
students are no longer eligible for the
Guaranteed Student Loan, there are
other loans available, usually at a
higher interest rate than the GSL.

“A significant number of people
will be affected in their loan sources.
They need to get their applications in
early, no surprises. Don’t wait until
July,”’ DeCourcy advises students.

Minority recruitment

weekend is successful

 

By DANA BOLDEN
Staff Reporter

 

This past weekend students may
have noticed a few minority high
school students attending their
classes. These students were here
because of the minority recruitment
weekend sponsored by W&L’s admis-
sions office.

According to Mimi Elrod, assistant
director of admissions, ‘‘We (the ad-
missions office) invite minority
students from the continental U.S.
who are admissible to spend the
weekend on campus.”’ She said the
students’ admissibility depends on
their credentials.

During these weekends, the stu-
dents attend three classes in their
areas of interest, talk with professors
and coaches in out-of-class situations
and meet with Elrod and Dean of
Minority Affairs Anece McCloud.

The admissions office will sponsor
another of these events during the

weekend of March 27. The Lip-Sync
Contest will be on the list of activities
for the prospective students.

Elrod added that the admissions of-
fice has been sponsoring these
weekends for about 10 years.

For next year, the office is con-
sidering hiring someone whose sole
responsibility will be to work with
minority recruitment.

Members of both Student Recruit-
ment and the Minority Recruitment
Committee were essential in making
sure the wekend was a success.
“Everyone in both organizations did
a wonderful job,”’ said Elrod.

When asked to evaluate the
weekend, Elrod responded, ‘‘I think
it’s gone very well. They (the pro-
spective students) seemed to be im-
pressed with the school and the
students.”

“We received a lot of positive feed-
back from these students,” added
Tom Brickel, co-chairman of MRC.
“It seems some will definitely re-
turn.”

The Washington and Lee lacrosse
team has accomplished something
that hasn’t been seen at W&L since
1982.

For the first time in four years,
W&L lacrosse will post a winning
record.

The Generals went three of three
last week, including an Old Dominion
Athletic Conference win over
Randolph-Macon, to put their overall
record at 7-1 (2-0 in the conference).

Yesterday at Randolph-Macon the
Generals beat the Yellow Jackets
15-11, yet the game was not as close
as it might seem.

W&L pulled senior goalie John
Church after building a 11-5 lead.

“We felt we were in command of
the game,” said head coach Dennis
Daly.

Sophomore Neill Redfern and
junior Sandy Harrison both had hat
tricks for the Generals.

“We didn’t play a great defensive
game,” said Daly. ‘ ‘We would slack
off and then come back.

‘We played well enough to win but
we'll have to improve to face the next
three teams on our schedule [Dart-
mouth, Middlebury, and Hampden-
Sydney.].

 

SPORTS

Finally, a winning
season for lacrosse

“But I’m happy,” continued Daly,
“we're 7-1 and we have a winning
season — there’s a lot to be optimistic
about.”’

On Monday the lacrosse squad
made sure that its lengthy bus ride to
VMI wasn’t all for naught, drum-
ming out the Keydets by a score of
15-9.

The game was close most of the
way, with the teams exchanging
goals for the entire contest.

“We were executing, but our

shooting wasn’t sharp,’”’ said head
coach Dennis Daly.

Luckily for the Generals, soph-
omore John Ware was sharp.

Ware almost singly handedly kept
the Generals in the contest. He either
scored or assisted on the Generals
first 11 goals. He went on to set a
school record for points with 12 (5
goals, 7 assists) for the afternoon.

Yet, despite Ware’s great in-
dividual effort, the Generals could
not seem to pull away from the
Keydets, who the Generals beat 20-2
last year.

“They played a notch up,”’ said Da-
ly. “They were a team ready to upset
us ”

Finally, late in the fourth quarter,
the Generals turned on the prover-
bial afterburners and smoked the
Keydets for 6 goals, putting the game

Baseball drops doubleheader during

 

By STUART SHELDON
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee baseball
team is in the middle of what head
coach Jeff Stickley called ‘“‘the
toughest schedule in the ODAC (Old
Dominion Athletic Conference).”’

With yesterday’s home stand
against Hampden-Sydney called off
due to rain, the Generals’ overall
record stands at 2-6, with a 1-3 ODAC

In action last week, the Generals
played on the road in a doubleheader
against Randolph-Macon. The
Generals dropped both ends of the
doubleheader, 12-1 and 8-6, but
Stickley was pleased with the play of
his team.

He said that Randolph-Macon
‘“‘was one of the top two teams in the
conference” and that W&L played
well in the second game. We did not
let ourselves drop after the first
game.” In fact, the Generals were
leading the Yellow Jackets 6-4 up to
the fifth inning.

Women’s tennis starts
off season at 3-0

By GARY McCULLOUGH
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee women’s
tennis team started off the 1987
season with three straight wins.
Leading the varsity team in these
matches were Sophomore Caroline
Hopper, Freshmen Theresa South-
ard, and Sophomores Dana Anstine,
Valerie Pierson, Catherine Nelligan,
Martha Christian, Laura Eggers,
and Benny Savage.

After edging past Hollins College
and Lynchburg College by equivalent
scores of 5-4, the Lady Generals
defeated Southern Seminary College
by a convincing 8-1 margin. Although
the team’s first two matches were

very close, their full capabilities
were not displayed in two of their
matches. “The sccond one we won
without three of the top five players,”
said Southard, and against Sem. we
were without two of the top five.”

The Women’s tennis team will be
facing Randolph-Macon Women’s
College at home on Friday. Head
coach Bill Washburn is fairly confi-
dent that it will be a good match-up.
He said that, from last year’s
statistics, Randolph-Macon would be
slightly favored, but he also said that
the Lady Generals had “greater
strength overall than last year.”

The key to the women’s success so
far has been the depth of their ladder,
and, hopefully, this will help them
surpass Randolph-Macon tomorrow
afternoon.

However, a bloop hit and a balk by
W&L allowed the Yellow Jackets to
pull ahead for the 8-6 win.

On March 20th Washington and Lee
hosted Eastern Mennonite in another
ODAC game. This time the Generals’
had the hot bats needed to win, and
they pounded E. Mennonite 21-8.

“We hit well and kept scoring
throughout the game,” Stickley said.
“This is a good sign.”’

The scoring was led by sophomore
shortstop Harry Halpert, who was 3
for 5 with a three-run home run, and

Track is victorious — again

By JIM LAKE
Staff Reporter

 

Less than two weeks into its out-
door season, the Washington and Lee

track team already owns a 6-0 dual
meet record, including victories over
Eastern Mennonite and Newport
News Apprentice College Tuesday
afternoon. The Generals, winners of
three meets thus far in 1987, have not
lost a regular season meet since 1983;
W&L has a 27-0 record, dating back to
the first meet of the 1984 season. And,
judging from W&L’s performance
Tuesday, head Coach Norris
Aldridge can be fairly certain that
his team’s winning streak will not
end anytime soon.

Tuesday’s meet at Wilson Field
saw the Generals coast to another
victory, taking first place in 14 of the
day’s 17 events and scoring more
than twice as many points as the
second-place team from Newport
News.

For the second time in as many

meets, junior Andrew White won
both the 110 and 400 meter hurdles,
finishing with times of 16.6 and 59.8
seconds in those events. His
classmate John White also won two
events, the triple jump and the 400
meter run, and took second place in
the long jump and high jump.

The distance events saw junior
Richard Moore take first place in the
1500 meters with a time of 4:15.5.
Senior Ash Andrews was right behind
him at 4:20.7. In the 5000, the
Generals swept the top three places,
with Andrews winning the event with
a time of 16:42.2. Junior Scott Rip-
peon was second at 16:52.8, and
senior Steve Pockrass finished a
tenth of a second later to take third
place. And sophomore Jamie Urso
won the 800 meters with a time of
2:03.4. i

The Generals took two of ‘the top
three places in the 100 meter dash.
Freshman Wes Boyd edged out
senior Kevin Weaver for second
place in that event; both were clock-
ed at 11.8 seconds. Boyd also took

most difficult portion of

sophomore third baseman Tom
Skeen, who went a perfect three-for
three and knocked in three runs.
Three other Generals had at least
three hits in the game.

As the Generals move into the sec-
ond half of their ODAC schedule, they
find themselves plagued by injuries.
This is very apparent in the pitching
department, which Stickley cited at
the beginning of the season as ‘‘one of
our strong points.”

Netmen ready for crucial weekend matches

By MIKE SHADY
_Assistant Sports Editor

Yesterday was just a warmup for
the Washington and Lee men’s tennis
team. Friday and Sunday are when
the matches really count.

The Generals destroyed Lynch-
burg yesterday in the minimum 18
sets required for the 9-0 victory. The
win follows an impressive 7-2 defeat
of Division I William and Mary on
Saturday and bumps W&L’s match
record up to 7-2. But it’s the upcom-
ing weekend that is of most concern

nerals.

The team takes on two preseason

nationally-ranked Division III
schools. On Friday at 3 p.m., W&L
plays No. 5 Emory and, on Sunday at
noon, the Generals go up against the
Little Quakers of No. 3 Swarthmore.

“We played very well in beating
William and Mary,” said head coach
Gary Franke, ‘and we will have to
play equally as well, if not better, in
these two crucial matches.”

Both Swarthmore and Emory par-
ticipated in the Division III national
championships last year in Clare-
mont, Ca. and Franke feels that these
matches will be instrumental in ob-
taining an invitation to this year’s
championship in Salisbury, Md.

“These are key matches, especial-
ly for ranking purposes,’ he said.

‘Both of them have just completed
successful Western swings against
numerous Division III schools in
California.”’

Against W&M, the Generals won
all three doubles and four singles
matches to pull away from the Tribe.
In the fall, W&L led 4-2 going into the
doubles matches, only to drop all
three of then and lose 5-4.

“{ Junior] Chris Wiman, at number
five and [freshman] John Morris at

number six, and all three of our
doubles teams really came through,”’
said Franke.

VOLLEYS ...Sophomore and No. 1

player Robert Haley continues to
struggle. Haley’s individual record
stands at 2-7 with his only two wins

‘coming in the teams’ shutout vic-

tories... The No. 1 doubles team of
junior David McLeod and sophomore
Bobby Matthews, however, continues
to roll along. Their record presently
stands at 8-1... Franke said he was
“just pleased to get the matches
{against} Lynchburg in.’ The
Generals were forced to play indoors
because of the rain... Not much is
known about this year’s version of
either Swarthmore or Emory besides
the rankings... Said Franke, ‘you
hear a little bit about them, but that’s
about it...”

-Bridgewater, is out for the rest of the

season, and another starter, sopho-
more Richard Grace, is out until at
least the end of Spring break with

near win at the Ferrum Invitational
this past weekend, the Generals are

The flip-flopping in ODAC play
began in a match on March 18 when
Bridgewater came out on top, while
the Generals managed to finish 10

won both relays, taking first in the
400 with a time of 44.7 seconds and in’
the mile at 3:40.4.

In the field events, the Generals

The Generals swept all four places
in the pole vault. Senior John Carder
took first place by clearing 13 feet, :

When junior varsity lacrosse was
dropped two years ago because of a
lack of interest, there was no team
for undergraduates or law students
who couldn’t play varsity lacrosse.

Thanks to the efforts of students
Jeff Mandak and Mark Whiteford,
there is now a school club team,
General Headquarters Tavern

Two years ago they went to Dean
Lewis G. John to ask for advice on
getting a club started. He gave them
the names of Mike Stone, who works
at VMI, and Stuart Thomas, who also
wanted to form a club team.

Those four started last year’s East
Lexington Lacrosse Club team.

“Last year’s team was _ less
organized and there was less interest
than we are having this year,” said
Mandak and Whiteford.

“This year we are more of a real
team as compared to last year, and
this has lead to an increase in par-

 

the Generals scored within seconds
to negate any advantage Gettysburg
might have gained.

“We totally dominated them in
everything,” said Daly. ‘We took the
game away.”

Total domination might be too mild
an appraisal. The Generals held the
Bullets without a goai for nearly thir-
ty minutes in the middle of the game.
And W&L was leading 19-4 when,
with 11 minutes remaining in the
game, the Generals substituted for
their starters.

Looking ahead to this weekend, the
Generals will face Dartmouth on
Wilson Field.

“They are one year older,” said
Daly, ‘‘and they have a large number
of people returning.

“They have a new coach and they
won their first game.” ‘‘So, they are
a confident team.”

“They will provide our most severe
test since UVa,” he said.

games and we only had one prac-
tice,” said Mandak.

“This year we practice at least
twice a week and have 38 members
on our team,”’ said Whiteford.

The team is open to any under-
graduate or law students who attend
Washington and Lee.

Last year the club wasn’t officially
recognized by the school but now the
club is, and according to Mandak, the
recognition makes it easier to have a
team.

This makes the team eligible to
receive money and support from the
Executive Committee and the GHQ.

Mandak and Whiteford said they
have received a lot of help and sup-
port from many different people, in-
cluding students and faculty and
even people in Lexington.

They went to Gerald Darrell,
Director of University Food Service
and the person responsible for the
GHQ, and asked if the GHQ could
sponsor the team. He agreed and
they named him coach of the team.

 

 

Although Darrell doesn’t actually
coach the team, he does things such
as having schedule cards printed.

The money for uniforms comes
from the Executive Committee and
the GHQ, according to Mandak.

According to Mandak and White-
ford, they receive a great amount of
help from lacrosse team coach Den-
nis Daly and Athletic Director
William McHenry.

Daly helps them with the schedul-
ing of teams and letting them use the
practice field.

“Anything he can help us with he
will. He hasn’t turned us down yet,”
said Whiteford and Mandak about
Daly’s contribution to the team.

McHenry is the club’s faculty ad-
visor and is very suggestive and sup-
portive of the team.

“He is at all the games and very
supportive of our efforts,”’ said Man-
dak.

The team currently practices on
the Law School field and plays its
home games on the varsity practice
field. In case they need another field,
the city has offered one on which they

Sophomore John Wave reaches high for the ball.

GH@Q lacrosse provides another alternative

can play.

Daly gives them names of possible
teams to play and reccommends the
team to any teams asking for com-
petition.

The schedule consists of local col-
leges or their junior varsity teams
and club teams.

‘Most away games are within an
hour and we provide our own trans-
portation,” said Mandak.

The basic philosophy behind the
team is to have fun and everybody is
there because of their love of
lacrosse, according to Whiteford and
Mandak.

The team is also very serious about
what they do and this is a big help for
Mandak and Whiteford, who serve as
the coaches for the team.

‘Mark decides who plays defense
and I decide the lines for the midfield
and attack,”’ said Mandak. ““Every-
one gets to play.”

“‘Coaches have told us it is a well
run student team,”’ said Whiteford.

The team has played four games
already and is 3-1. They resume their
play after spring break and have five
games remaining on their schedule.

SPE LR CTRL A FARR NO eT BLL TINIE
By JOHN PACKETT
Staff Reporter

 

Freshman David Olson is
Washington & Lee’s Athlete of the
Week for his efforts at the Divi-
sion III National Swimming
Championships in Canton, Ohio.

Olson was named an all-
American, in the 200-yard back-
stroke. To be an all-American, a
swimmer must place i nthe top
eight of an event.

Olson placed seventh with a
time of 1:56.43.

During the time trials Olson set
the school record in the 200-yard
with a time of 1:56.23.

“T was happy with my times in
the 200-yard,” said Olson. “I
thought they were really good.”’

“Being in the nationals was a
whole lot of pressure,”’ said Olson.
“It was a lot more than I had ex-
perienced before.”

Olson was also named an hon-

orable mention all-American in
two other events.

He placed fourteenth in the 100-
yard backstroke with a time of
54.3.

“I was hoping to do better in the
100-yard, but I think I can im-
prove.”

He was also part of the 400-yard
medley relay team from Washing-
ton & Lee, which finished thir-
teenth with a time of 3:32.63.

Olson said that the relay team
did a good job. The members of
the relay team were senior Marty
Radvany and sophomores David
Reavy and Jeff Bercaw.

Olson has been swimming since
he was 10 years old and likes the
competition.

“In high school, swimming was
more of an individual sport, but in
college it is more of a team
sport,” said Olson.

Olson was swim and soccer cap-
tain of the Robinson High School
teams.

Shades on Sports [

Lloyd Daniels

Whose fault is it?

Let me tell you the story of a great basketball player. Let me tell you
the story of a young man (boy?) who is 20 years old and yet can’t even
read this column. Let me tell you the story of greed, money and ex-
ploitation. Let me tell you the story of Lloyd Daniels.

Daniels has been heralded as the “second coming of Magic
Johnson” and the best player to come out of New York since a scrawny
big fella named Lew Alcindor. According to a story in the Washington
Post, Daniels is currently enrolled at the University (ugh) of Nevada-
Las Vegas and could possibly play for the Runnin’ Rebels next season.
Daniels has never graduated from the 11th grade.

It’s the same old story of an athlete being given every break just
because he can put a little rubber ball in a metal hoop better than
anyone else. But there is one hitch in this scenario that makes it dif-
ferent. Daniels could possibly be the best basketball player ever to
play the game and that fact alone is what separates him from most or-
dinary superstars.

People refuse, rightly or wrongly, to give up on this young man. He
has been enrolled in four different high schools (twice at Virginia’s
Oak Hill Academy) during his life, most of the time with all his tuition
and extra expenses paid for by someone else. Scouts say he is so good
that he could have jumped to the pros and forgone college altogether.
Because of his extraordinary talents, Daniels has been given
numerous chances to succeed and yet continues to fail in the
classroom. He says he is not stupid but his reading ability is at about
the third-grade level.

What bothers me about the whole situation is not the fact that so
many people are pampering this guy, but Daniels’ attitude toward
everything provided him. Daniels knows he is great and he knows he is
going to make megabucks in the NBA. But is he willing to work for it?
Believe it or not, playing at the professional level is a job that requires
discipline, motivation and just plain hard work. Talent is not enough to
get you by (ask Chris Washburn if you think I’m wrong). More than
once Daniels has exasperated coaches with his laziness and poor work
ethics.

Does this guy have the desire it takes to be great? Right now, the
answer is no. Obviously he doesn’t have it in the classroom. What
Daniels needs to do is a little ‘soul searching” and figure out exactly
what he wants to do with his life. He is so far behind academically that
help is necessary, but only to a certain point. Daniels has to start earn-
ing his way through the system.

In the Post’s story, one teacher tried to explain Daniels’ passing
grades by asking if a kid goes to class and tries, should he fail the
course? Are you kidding me? If he can’t handle the material that you
are teaching him now, what good is it to pass him along to the next,
more difficult grade of school? This doesn’t teach Daniels anything ex-
cept that all he has to dois put forth some effort in order to pass.

I hope things work out for Daniels. I really do. Reading the com-
ments from the people associated with him, I feel that he is not a mean
person. Daniels is just a basketball player who, when he was very
young, found out that his talents on the court more than made up for
his disabilities in the classroom. Mr. Daniels, I wish you the best of
luck.

Notes...What ever happened to team play? It seems that lately all
anybody cares about is personal statistics and not about whether the
team won or lost. If all you worry about is the number of points or
saves you got then why don’t you go play one of those individual sports
— like squash...

A surprise Final Four — Take Providence and UNLV in the
semifinals, and the Runnin’ Rebels in the championship final... Auto
racing is a very exciting sport. Then again, watching a matchbox car
on a spinning turntable is also entertaining...

Drive-In conjur

rs

 

By MICHAEL TUGGLE
Movie Critic

What does the last week of March
mean to you? To most of us,it means
that spring is finally here and that,
with only one week of classes left
before exams, we are probably
behind in our work.

To Sebert Hull, however, the last
week of March means it’s time to
polish the candy case, hook up the
fountain, cut the grass and oil the
projector. Because this Friday night,
the lights come up and the cars roll in
for the 37th opening of Hull’s Drive-In
Theatre.

For over 30 years, Hull has been
providing entertainment from the
last weekend in March until the last
weekend of October and looks for-

ward to starting another year Friday
night.

“Tt’s fun!” Hull gipped, an excited
anticipation in his voice. “I just want
people to come out and have a good
time.”’

While Hull expressed that last year
there were occasional problems get-
ting films from the overbooked rental
companies, he doesn’t foresee any
difficulties this year at all.

“Last year the company cancelled
Top Gun twice before I finally got it.
This year they had problems with
Crecedile Dundee, but more prints
have been made.”’

Daylight savings time and the
development of the VCR have been
major setbacks for the drive-in
theater, according to Hull. In reality,
the drive-in theater has nearly
vanished as a component of the film
industry in the United States. In the
bigger cities such as Roanoke, the ex-
tinction has arisen due to property
values. When the theater could no

longer make more than its value
price, development companies took
them over. What was once an in-
tegral part of our parents’ youth has
more or less become a nostalgic
memory.

Sebert Hull is dedicated to keeping
the Drive-In on Route 11 open. With
nearly excessive room, Hull anxrous-
ly awaits the customers that will fill
the 300 vehicular seats up to an hour
before viewing time. This week’s
double feature, Tough Guys, starring

Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster,
and The Color Of Money, staring

day and Sunday nights.

Starting April 5th, the films will
begin at 9:00 p.m. due to Daylight
Savings Time, but until then, all
showings will begin at 8:00 p.m. Ad-

Anticipation hovers over Oscars

By MICHAEL TUGGLE
Movie Critic

 

Federico Fellini commented after
winning his fourth Academy Award,
“In the mythology of the cinema,
Oscar si the supreme prize.”

In reality, no other prize in the
entertainment industry is as coveted
as the golden twelve inch statuette
we call Oscar. For the last month, ac-
tors and actresses, producers and
directors, cinematographers and
sound technicians have been waiting
in anticipation to see who will take
home the coveted prize this year.
Now, the waiting is over and the part
is set to begin Monday night, as the
59th Annual Academy Awards are
presented in Beverly Hills.

This has been an excellent year for
film. We have experienced history,
comedy, tragedy, a trip to Viet Nam,
a man-eating plant, a trip to the past,
one to the future, and the best, most
expensive navy recruitment film in
history. All of these will join together
Monday night in anticipation to see
just who is the best of 1986.

Here is a list of the nominees, along
with my picks for this year’s Oscars:
Best Picture: Children of a Lesser
God, Hannah and Her Sisters, The Mis-
sion, Platoon, A Room With A View.
*TUG’S TAG - The Mission.

* Best Actress: Jane Fonda,
Marlee Matlin, Sissy Spacek,
Kathleen Turner, and Sigourney

* TUG’S TAG - Marlee Matlin, for

W&L trustees repeal coeducatio

' Wilson resigns after
. trustees historic decision

 

By MICHAEL HUNT
Staff Reporter

 

John D. Wilson is out!
= The former Rhodes Scholar, who
, has been president of Washington
and Lee since 1983, announced his
* resignation Monday. He cited the
, board of trustees’ decision to admit
only women to the University’s
* undergraduate program as_ his
» primary reason for quitting.
‘The board’s decision is really the
" best thing for the University. After
; all, there must be close to a million
small, private coeducational schools
* in Virginia and North Carolina,”
« Wilson said.

Wilson will always be remembered
as the man who brought women to
« W&L in 1985.

‘Now that the transition to an all-
female W&L has been made, I feel
+ my mission is completed,’ said a
tearful Wilson.

Wilson has been asked to head the
* notions department of Best Products
Inc., headquartered in Richmond.
But he is reluctant to accept the of-
» fer.

“T just don’t think accepting the
position is the ‘best’ thing for me or
’ the company.”

ing chairing a commission looking in-
‘ to the legality of merging W&L with

associated for years,’’ Lewis said. ‘‘A
merger would simply make it of-
ficial.’

“Washington and Lee will be
known as ‘The Best University in
Virginia.’ ”

A statement released by the board
said an extensive search to fill the
vacancy created by Wilson’s resigna-
tion is underway. As we go to press,

Colorado Congresswoman Pat
Schroeder, former university
secretary Carole Chappell and

graduating senior Andrew Caruthers
are the strongest candidates to suc-
ceed Wilson.

Sources close to the board said that
one of these three candidates will be
the next president.

After preliminary interviews are
conducted, both candidates will be
judged in swimsuit and evening wear
competitions, as well as on poise and
personality. In the case of a tie, each
candidate will be asked how they
would bring about world peace.

Rick Robbins, advisor of the
newly-formed Men’s’ Forum;
Markham Pyle, owner of the Lex-
ington Diet Center and former Ex-
ecutive Committee President John
Lewis are on the panel of judges.

The competition will be held in the
Party Barn Thursday at 8 p.m. and is
open to the public. Tickets are $50 per
couple with all proceeds going to the
Men’s Forum.

Schroer’s tarts win big

By MUFFIN BURGER
Staff Reporter

 

Associate Dean of Students Anne
C.P. Schroer is leaving Washington
and Lee University.

Schroer said in a news conference
Monday that after spending two
years at W&L she realizes a woman's
proper place is in the kitchen. ‘‘But I
wanted to combine my desire for a
career with my womanly instincts,”
she said. ‘‘So I am going to work for
Betty Crocker.”

When Schroer joins Betty Crocker
in July she will be senior vice presi-
dent for baked goods. She gained her
position with Betty Crocker by win-
ning an international bake-off,
defeating Margaret Thatcher, Jerry
Darrell and a relatively unknown
French chef, Keeble Mercier. Her
prize-winning entry was a batch of
raspberry tarts.

“It also helps when you are the
spitting image of Betty Crocker,’’ she
said in her most self-depracating
manner.

Schroer’s likeness to the world-
famous cook was also noticed by of-
ficials at Betty Crocker. Negotiations

All female classes
to begin next year

 

By LUCE NUTZ
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee Universi-
ty Board of Trustees decided in a
secret meeting Monday that a
gender-neutral student body is not
compatable with the philosophy of
the university.

However, when the wheel of fate
was spun, the coeds of the female
gender were chosen to be the ones to
walk the hallowed halls of Washing-
ton and Lee.

“‘Now we'll really be able to offer
something to prospective students:
an all-women’s college in the Valley
where one can get an education,”’
said Jefferson Davis Futch III, pro-
fessor of history.

“It’s the next best thing to an all-
male W&L,”’ said J. Thomas
Touchton ‘60, a member of the board
of trustees. ‘‘We (the board) thought
the girls would do a better job of
keeping the university clean. If they
do a good job we can lay-off some of
the maintenance crew and save some
money. It was all a question of
finance.”

Dan Rather and the crew at CBS
Evening News broke the news to the
world. There were mixed reactions
on campus.

“T think this is the greatest thing
since the beginning of point cards in
the Co-op,” gushed one sophomore
woman. ‘‘When we get rid of the text-
book section, W&L will have one of

the best cookbook selections in the
known world. After all, that is what
we are here for.”’

Another commented that Fancy
Dress would be a “‘lot better now’
because women would be in charge of
decorating.

Andrew Caruthers, a senior from
Shreveport, La. who is one of the
most outspoken opponent os coeduca-
tion, said the move was a good one.

“T liked W&L much more when it
was all-male,’’ Caruthers said. ‘‘But
since the admissions office hasn’t let
in any real men in the last two years,
I guess it was good that they made it
official.

A statement released by the
trustees said males currently enroll-
ed in the University could graduate
but no more would be allowed to
matriculate.

A second statement said no money
would be accepted from ‘‘the grubby
hands of pre-coed alumni.”’

Farris P. Hotchkiss, head of the
Development Office, is not sure how
the problem of fund raising would be
handled. He added that he did not
care because he had been fired.

Anne S. Farrar, the assistant head
of development Office, was named to
replace Hotchkiss.

“For years I have felt like Della
Street following behind Perry Mason
and doing all his dirty work,” Farrar
said. ‘‘Now I’m calling the shots.”

Farrar has quite a job ahead of
her. She must be able to raise as

EC members nailed
on honor violation

 

By ALFRED E. NEUMAN
Staff Reporter

 

All 13 members of the Executive
Committee, from President Shayam
Menon to freshman representative
Scott Jules, were found guilty yester-
day of embezzling student body funds
in an open honor trial at Lee Chapel.

What made this trial especially in-
teresting for the packed house was
that Jimmy Humphreys, the EC
representative from the third-year
law class, prosecuted himself and the
12 other committee members

The jury for the case was made up
of Lexington citizens, since no
students could be found who were not
friends or close acquaintances of the
EC members. Menon said this was
because EC candidates campaign so
extensively, EC members are widely
known and ‘‘a lot of people hold
grudges against the candidates for
leaving a ton of paper under their
doors.”’

Menon added that several people
said they would not be biased for or
against the people on trial but that he
could tell they were lying and so
dismissed them from jury duty.

Humphreys accused the EC
members of running Virginia's

largest false identification operation,
using embezzled student funds to
operate the business.

The operation was discovered
several weeks ago, Humphreys said,
when a freshman entering the GHQ
presented an I.D. that showed him to
be of legal age. When questioned how
he could be of legal age as a
freshman, the young man _ broke
down and said he got the card from
sophomore representative Christo-
pher deMovellan.

In exchange for immunity, Hum-
phreys said, the freshman brought
several of his friends to an EC
meeting one night and each identified
a different EC member who had sup-
plied him a false I.D.

Menon then assigned deMovellan,
Vice President Brandt Surgner and
first-year law representative Dave
Nave to investigate the charges.
What they uncovered will surely be
recorded in the annals of criminal
history.

The three investigators discovered
that the EC bought more than $13,000
worth of equipment to operate a false
I.D. business. Among the items
recovered by University Proctor
Murph Murray were a professional

MY SPEW

By Chris Carter

 

Thank the Good Lord! I have been
waiting lo these many months and
finally it appeared. Richard Rob-
bins’s letter in last week’s Phi
demonstrated that the W&L Man
does still exist, though high on the en-
dangered species list, and should
have set us all straight on the over-
riding issue of concern for this
millenium in his clear, cogent, and
objective account of coeducation at
Washington and Lee. For those of you
who missed Mr. Robins’s epistolary
masterpiece, I shall review his well-
taken points.

There can be no question that, as
Mr. Robins says, W&L took the “‘easy
way out’ when it determined to
spend millions of dollars and enor-
mous amounts of administrative
hours to facilitate the transition to
coeducation, knowing that in so doing
it would disenchant large numbers of
alumni and students. It is just this
sort of laziness and lack of interest in
the University which infuriates me
most about the administration. And
certainly the Catharsis evoked by the
“tragedy” of coeducation has been
felt by all and hardly needed Mr.
Robins’s articulation.

Again, Mr. Robins is dead on when

he says that the W&L man of the past
could be spotted MILES away by the
code of gentlemanly conduct which
he always wore (wool before Easter,
cotton — no polyester on a W&L man
lest he take the hives Thence until
Halloween). An EC member was just
telling me the other day that since
coeducation, the sales in honor
cloaks had absolutely PLUM-
METED, and that at large cocktail
parties he no longer could distinguish
his friends from the Wahoos from
over Afton Mountain. Indeed, as Mr.
Robins so cogently points out, the
very high number of W&L grads who
are business leaders, still easily
distinguished from business leaders
who had the misfortune to graduate
from other, less success-instilling
schools, results solely from the in-
sular effects of single-sex education.
Mr. Robins continues by bemoan-
ing — and rightly so I think — the fact
that W&L persons are no longer well-
rounded. Post-Coed students tend to
have higher SAT scores, which we all
know BY DEFINITION means that
they do nothing but study. I, like him,
regret that we no longer have
students interested in sports or the
arts. Certainly the way things are go-
ing now, the Warner Center and du-
Pont Hall will soon have to be con-
verted into storage buildings for lack
of use. This is also likely to be the last
year of a Fancy Dress, since, as this
year’s ball proved without a doubt,

MY SPURT

By CLEMENT

EDWARD KLANK, III

Robert Benchley once remarked
“A man seldom thinks of taking
Turkish baths until it is too late.’’ I
would like to share with the readers a
blatant act of crudity that I ex-
perienced recently in the Co-op.

Just the other day I was in the Food
Cooperative/Bookstore and the
recently established tape and com-
pact disc shop. I was innocently
waiting in line to purchase a diet
beverage. The somewhat overweight
patron immediately in front of me
was examining the fruit and salad
bar. I immediately noticed the close
similarity between the person in
front of me and the vile Jabba the
Hut, a disgusting character from the
“Star Wars’”’ trilogy.

With a little spittle dripping from
her double chin, she eyeballed the
delicious red apples. Finally she
publicly proclaimed that she would
eat an apple — “‘I think I’ll have an
apple today.’ She aggressively lifted
an apple.

From a short distance it looked like
a respectable piece of fruit. Instead
of putting the apple on her tray, she

student interest in such social events
has become almost non-existent. But
perhaps we could convert duPont and
the Warner into clinics where the
many students who are studying and
thinking too hard to have time to eat
could attach themselves to an I.V. in
order to keep reading. Fraternity
houses too could serve this function.
Finally, in his most penetrating,
even breathtaking, point of logic, Mr.
Robins proves through the seductive
reasoning of his hero Epicureastotle
that Robert E. Lee would be
disgusted with future graduates of
his University. Certainly, it is unlike-
ly that the man who ensured that his
own daughters were well-educated
and who said that the one regret he
had about his military career was his
lack of a liberal education, who
guaranteed that the nearly defunct
Washington College should become
an educational leader by recruiting
students from outside the failed Con-
federacy, would want the successor
to that institution to press on into the
educational future and to admit
students who enjoy and are capable
of high intellectual stimulation.
Moreover, there is no question that
the man who detested drunkenness
and was a devout Episcopalian would
be a strong supporter of the current
fraternity system and social life here
at W&L. The spirit of Robert E. Lee
pervades this place, and, as Mr.
Robins so correctly points out, we
ought always to consider our own opi-

fondles his sandwich before consum-
ing it. She even had the audacity to
stick it up to her snout. Unsatisfied,

line moved forward. ;
Well, obviously this person also
had the civility of the vile Jabba the
Hut. I don’t know anyone that wants
to eat an apple that has been exten-
sively fondled by some thing. This
type of ‘‘dining foreplay”’ is simply a
lack of common courtesy and man-
ners; massaging food and then put-

ting it back for another person tocon- .

sume is barbarism. Where had her

hands been? She had probably been «

petting a canine, picking her face, or
using the restroom. This person acts

as if she were raised in a barn; she °

would probably fit in with a bunch of

swine. If you touch it, eat it. I honest-

ly felt like sticking the apple in her
fat jowls, but I was afraid she would
swallow it whole with my arm right
behind the apple. If you see a person

the thing like a stepchild. In conclu-
sion, ‘Friends come and go, but

about any issue, regardless of our
amount of knowledge of the issue or
of Lee himself.

The members of the student body

owe Mr. Robins a round of applause — .
— or at least a pitcher at the Palms

— for setting out so clearly what I

have merely summarized with ad- ,

mittedly less grace and formal
argumentation. I certainly applaud

the amount of careful thinking he put .

into his letter and am myself in com-
plete support of his position. It is
clearer than crystal that the

presence of women on this campus is ,

indeed the cause of all problems
which we have experienced not only
since 1985 but probably even before.
You can be certain that my name will

be on Mr. Robins’s petition, right —

below his own.

Mr. Robins, those few of us W&L

men left, who truly believe in this

University and in the legacy of |

Robert E. Lee, who endorse the
benefits of honor and gentlemanly
conduct, and who appreciate well-
reasoned and thoughtfully presented
thinking, look forward to a female-

free 1991, and anxiously await the in- ~

stant narcotic euphoria the lifting of
our current pestilence will bring. I
am only sorry that I shall by then be
out in the real world, forced to co-
exist with all the women who live out
there, rather than here in Lexington
and the Eden that shall be reestab-
lished.

Hurray for single-sex W&L and sensible letters

To the Editors:

The best thing about a non-coed W&L will be
the end of the senseless letters about coeducation
that have so cluttered the Phi in recent months.

I’m sure you all know the letters I am talking
about. They are usually three or four paragraphs
(or more) long, have lots of parentheses, and
usually have no point. Furthermore, these let-
ters usually ramble on senselessly and the
writers try to implement as many vocabulary
words as can conceivably fit into sentences in
order to leave some sort of favorable impression
on their fellow students that, because the writer
uses big words, he/she must be of superior in-
telligence. Of course, some clown (or worse, a
group of people) always responds to one of those
letters with a witty one-liner and those really ir-
ritate me.

All in all, then, I think it’s really great that
W&L is going to be a woman’s college.

Dear Marie:

Ihave a problem.

Like you, I am a female. My problem deals
with myself in bed. Not just myself, you under-

blem with me and my boyfriend is that I keep
faking orgasms. But really, it’s not my problem.

I think it’s his problem. You see, he was cir-
cumcised when he was eight days old, and I read
in Newsweek last week that this operation ac-
tually is not necessary and may not even be
healthy. I fell like I’m missing something, you

Should I see a peer counselor? I’m afraid I'd be
the first one. Did you know that a ‘t’ in the middle
of ‘‘peer’’ spells ‘‘peter’?’’ You’re a dorm

Should I ask him to get a foreskin graft? I’ve
heard such operations are available. Do they

The Ring-tum Phi Parody, April 1, 1987

 

 

IECONOLEX,

By Joseph McCythmyass and Del Van Attaboy

The decision to make Washington and Lee all-female is one more
manifestation how an underground Communist network head-
quartered in the Midwestern United States is attempting to undermine
old-fashioned American democracy.

Unlike Virginia, where one must be born and bred to be considered a
“native,” the Midwest is very non-discriminatory. Anyone who has
ever lived in or even flown near the Midwest is considered a corn-
husker.

That is why John Elrod, a native Georgian, is a Midwesterner. So is
University Librarian Barbara Brown, who has worked at Cornell,
Princeton, Stanford and W&L since leaving her Iowa home.

The fact that the Midwest is Communist also is undeniable. After all,

\_ why do you think the invincible Indiana Hoosiers are known as the Big
‘Red Machine? And do you know why they beat the Orangemen of

Syracuse? I’ve been a Hoosier since 1979, and I have irrefutable
evidence that it’s because the Commies bet big money on them.

The Communist infiltration first became noticeable here about four
years ago. According to information obtained by my associate, Del
Van Attaboy, W&L President John D. Wilson not only went to England
during his Rhodes Scholar years but also to the Soviet Union, where he
learned that all institutions — including colleges — ought to be state-
run.

He and the Red Trustees quickly brought more state-loving com-
rades into the University’s bureaucracy and then de-balled us by
bringing in bitches. Recently, they bought the ‘Red House.” Now,
they’ve taken the even more heinous and hegemonic step of making
W&L all-female. Next thing you know, they'll close the milk bar.

Perhaps you're one of those whining weenie wusses who’s wonder-
ing what’s so bad about a coed or even an all-female W&L. Well, let me
tell you.

There once was a time, not too long ago, when we didn’t worry a
whole helluva lot about how smart W&L students were. They just had
to be MEN, i.e., anatomically correct and emotionally stable.

At that time, we MEN could study without being distracted by
female breasts, butts, scents and giggling. Rather than worry about
how we dressed, looked and smelled, we MEN concentrated on being
GENTLEMEN.

We knew that women were made to be looked at and not spoken to,
unless we needed them to do our laundry or fulfill our manly needs. We
knew the advantages of a one-night roll in the hay, but we were wise
enough not to do it every day. We were smart enough to look at these
chicks only one or two mornings a week, not ona daily basis.

And we had a sense of comaraderie because we all dated three or
four different roadchicks at a time without being caught. Those were
the days when men really were MEN.

Those days need not be gone, but we cannot be as wishy-washy as
Rick Robins and merely post a petition. We’ve gotta fight for our
rights. Now is the time for all good MEN to come out of their fraternity
houses and roast the Reds. They raped this university. Let’s rape their
wenches.

Meet in the ODK circle tonight at midnight, baring and bearing
arms, and we will show these Midwestern Commies what God hath

wrought.

+ The Pulitzer Prize for local news
coverage was awarded yesterday to
The Ring-tum Phi. The staff, elated
by the news, threw a large party in
the Phi office to celebrate the award.
“I’m really psyched about this,”’
’ said Sean Bugg, editor of the student
, newspaper. “It’s great to have your
work recognized with such a promi-

* nent award.”
The award was presented to the
Phi for their coverage of the Inter-
" fraternity Council and fraternity af-
‘fairs. ‘“‘The amazingly detailed
coverage of IFC meetings and the
good placement of those stories was
very instrumental in our decision,”
said a Pulitzer board official. ‘“‘The
stories left no doubt in the reader’s
mind about what was really going on
with fraternities at Washington and

‘We just wanted to do what we
could to benefit fraternities and the
student body,” said Bugg.

The Pulitzer official specifically
mentioned the Phi’s investigative
reporting work and editorial cover-
age of the incident during Rush in
which a freshman was injured at
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.

“It was a marvel of accuracy,
fairness and creativity,’’ he said.

Pulitzer prize winning professor of
journalism, and my personal hero,
Clark R. Mollenhoff said, “It’s ob-
vious that the Phi followed my Seven
Basic Rules of sound investigative
reporting, especially rule four, ‘Don’t
exaggerate or distort the facts or the
law.’ ”’

IFC president Christopher B. Sax-
man, who nominated the Phi for the
award, said, “I think it’s great that
those guys are finally getting what
they deserve, and I’m very happy for
them. I’ve supported them from the
very beginning, you know.”

Associate Dean of Students Leroy
C. ““Bu-u-uddy”’ Atkins said, ‘‘I didn’t
think the staff of the Phi was able to
govern themselves. I guess I was
wrong.”

Sex scandal

Wa&L cheerleader linked with Jim Bakker

By JERRY FALWELL
Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee Head
Cheerleader Bambi Stark has been
implicated in yet another scandal in-
volving televangelist Jim Bakker
and his dog Stain.

According to confidential reports,
just two days after winning the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
Cheerleading Championship last
month, which gave them a berth to
the NCAA Cheerleading Contest to be
held in Honolulu in May, Stark and
the remaining W&L cheerleading
squad visited the Bakkers’ multi-
million dollar theme park Heritage,
USA.

While at the theme park, Stark
alleges that the members of the
squad were personally contacted by
Bakker, who asked them if they
would like to visit his multi-million
dollar estate. Stark said she had no
idea that Bakker and his wife Tam-
my Faye would be having ‘‘a wild
party involving things that you would
never imagine possible.”’

Police say that as the other squad
members prepared to leave the par-
ty, Bakker’s dog, named Stain,
“physically assaulted Stark and
prevented her from exiting the
household.”’

Apparently the dog, a chihuahua,
soiled Stark’s black leather dress
beyond repair. When asked why she
was wearing a black leather dress,
Stark replied that she thought the
event was ‘‘a costume party.”’

Although no charges have been fil-
ed as of today, Stark said she is still
considering filing a civil suit against
the Bakkers and their amorous
canine.

Stain Bakker, 77 in human years,
was contacted at the Bakkers’ multi-
million dollar home in Palm Springs
yesterday, but he and his owners
refused to comment on the alleged in-

cident.

Stain, who had been signed by the
Alpo dog food corporation to do a
series of 30-second television com-
mercials for the dog food chain, has
been dropped by the company due to
what they refer to as Stain’s ‘‘total
disregard for public opinion, lack of
judgment, and moral turpitude.”

Alpo has now signed Rev. Jimmy
Swaggart’s dog Blaspheme to
replace Stain as the official Alpo
spokesdog. It was Swaggart who ex-
posed the entire ‘‘Staingate”’ scandal
to the Phi.

 

‘Do-it-yourself’ beginner’s drug plants are now being offered at the W&L
Bookstore. ‘‘Just like the CD’s, the plants can be charged home to Mom and

Dad,” said Tidge Roller, manager.

Oh, definitely! It’s so easy to
care for and can be worn in almost
any situation.

Rumors have been circulating in
the cheerleading world that Stark
might be forced to give up her title as
head cheerleader because of the Bak-
ker incident. These rumors are being
vehemently denied by Stark.

“IT just can’t understand why
anyone would want to discredit me or
the squad just because of one
mistake,’’ she said. ‘‘I only did what I
thought best for the squad.”’

Assistant Head Cheerleader Velma
Goldstein said that although she was
in favor of Stark keeping the title, she

could understand why officials might
want to have a replacement.

“Unfortunately, it might be
necessary to change the tarnished
image of our squad. If it came to a
change in leadership, I would under-
stand and be prepared to take charge
for the sake of the University.”

Stark and other members of the
W&L cheerleading squad said that
they “were just glad it’s all over
with”’ and are gearing up for the May
NCAA cheerleading competition in
Hawaii.

Dart hits Atkins;
saved by a head

By NEAD L. SHARP
Staff Reporter

 

Associate Dean of Students Leroy
C. “Buddy” Atkins was injured this
past weekend while hunting in the
George Washington National Forest.
He was struck by a five-inch blow
dart.

“IT don’t know where it came
from,”’ said Atkins from Stonewall
Jackson Hospital, where he is being
held for observation. ‘“‘The last I
remember I was saying to Brian, ‘Be
vewy, vewy quiet. We’re hunting
wabbit,’ and the next thing I know
I'm lying on my back.”

Brian Shaw, minister of propagan-
da for Washington and Lee, was with
Atkins at the time the incident oc-
curred, ‘I heard someone say, ‘Of
course you know, this means war,’
just before Buddy was hit.”’

Atkins was saved from serious in-
jury because the dart hit him in the
head. He was wearing a thick, red
hunting cap, which allowed the dart

to penetrate only about an inch. Dr.
Bug S. Bunnie, who is treating
Atkins, said, “I think Elmer ...]
mean Buddy... will be fine. The dart
didn’t hit anything important.”’

Bunnie also added, ‘“‘He’s a very
fortunate man. We’ve got him hooked
up to the machine that goes ‘Bing!’”’
Bunnie said that Atkins was now ona
steady diet of creamed carrots and
carrot juice.

Shaw described the unidentified
assailant as about 4 feet 5 inches,
with long ears, buck teeth, gray fur
and a bushy cotton tail. “‘I didn’t real-
ly see enough to tell exactly what it
was,”’ Shaw said.

However, Shaw did hear the at-
tacker say, ‘‘I got that Elmer Fudd
this time!”’

Atkins’ major worry at this time,
he says, is that ‘‘I won’t be able to go
out and tie one on this weekend. I
guess I'll be forced to study or
something. That really makes me
%?*!&? mad!”

The Ring-tum Phi has un-
overed an escort ring operating
jut of one room on the third floor
f Baker Dormitory, dealing ex-
‘lusively with Virginia Military
Institute cadets.

Under the direction of Pulitzer
Prize-winning journalist Clark R.
Mollenhoff, the Phi’s  in-

estigative reporting staff staked
ut Room 333 and questioned the
adets who were spotted leaving
the area

‘We were just visiting some old

iends,’’ said one cadet, who

‘fused to give his name, A Phi
eporter recognized the student’s
iniform decorations as those nor-
mally found on the third-class

adets, who are the equivalent of
ophomores.

rhe intrepid female Phi
reporter followed the third of
Mollenhoff’s Seven Rules of In-
vestigative Reporting, ‘Know

your subject.’’ She followed a
cadet up to the third floor and
vaited for him to exit the room,
irm-in-arm with a W&L woman
student

The reporter then entered the
unlocked but vacant room and
waited until another cadet, who
introduced himself as ‘‘Bull
Moose,’’ came into the room and
asked, ‘So, do you want to eat at
Spanky’s or Estelle’s tonight?”

As the reporter accompanied
| the cadet outside the dorm, she

| asked him how many times he had
been to ‘‘The Room’’ within the

| past six months.

Bull Moose said, “I usually

\

new mixers next year

Piermont said the necessity of
returning a date by midnight divides
the evening in half.

“T usually drop off my date at the
barracks, then go back to one of the
fraternity parties and find another
guy. But once the administration
phases out coeducation, I’ll have to
just go home by myself,” she said
with tears of anticipated loneliness
spilling out of her eyes, which were
flawlessly made up, just like Tammy
Faye Bakker’s.

Of course, some of the women
students at Washington and Lee have
already begun dealing with any
possible problems that may occur
when no more W&L gentlemen roam
the hallways of the dormitories,
preying upon vulnerable women.

The residents of one non-freshman
dormitory hall have organized small-
scale mixers and socials for par-
ticular groups of cadets, mostly of
the third-class, or sophomore, level.

“Sometimes they aren’t allowed
out of the barracks unless they have
dates, so we go over and escort them
out,”’ said Sharritt Berryl, a W&L
sophomore.

(See related story for details on
escort ring.)

Berryl’s hallmates agree on the
need for relaxed barracks regula-
tions to facilitate inter-campus
socialization.

‘“‘We’ve had to break up or leave
dozens of parties just to let the guys
get back in time,” said Berryl’s
roommate, Ilsa Frusen-gladbag.

“It really chafes our social life,”’
Frusen-gladbag concluded.

least one of the two nights. I’ve
been visiting the girls since Octo-
ber, I guess around Halloween.”

As the two approached the en-
trance to Spanky’s, the reporter
decided to follow another of
Mollenhoff’s Seven Rules: Rule
Five, “Deal straight across the
board with your sources and in-
vestigation subjects alike.’’ She
told Bull Moose that she was not
an official escort, but asked for his
help in learning the true story
behind the service.

Bull agreed to speak to the Phi,
but on the condition his real name
not be used.

“The two girls who are the
leaders of the ring are Sharritt
Berryl and Ilsa Frusen-gladbag,
who live in Room 333. They have
been making contacts over at VMI
since the beginning of the school
year. They didn’t really start the
service officially until the end of
September.

“See, some of the disciplinary
punishments that the cadets
receive forbid them to leave the
post unless their date comes to get
them. Sharritt and Ilsa arrange
for girls to be available as
escorts.”

When asked who the girls were,
Bull said, ‘I guess they’re W&L
students, but sometimes I think
Sharritt imports some of her
friends from outside of Lexington.
You know, to add a new face now
and then.”’

When the Phi reporter called
the number listed for Berry] in the
Lexington Centel telephone direc-
tory, she reached an answering
machine. The message on that
machine consisted only of the
song, ‘‘Call Me,’’ by Blondie.

Raped men to gather

By HONEY MONEY
Staff Reporter

 

The Interfraternity Council and the
Women’s Forum will co-sponsor a
mandatory wallet-rape seminar for
all freshmen on Monday at 8 p.m. in
the Warnhim Center.

Participants will be divided
according to gender. IFC represen-
tatives will discuss with the men how
to prevent wallet rape, while WF
members will teach the women how
to empty a wallet efficiently and ef-
fectively. The men and women then
will come together to learn about
what the other sex discovered.

Wallet rapes occur at an orgasmic
rate on college campuses nationwide,
according to University Psychologist
Jim Worth. And since the advent of
coeducation at W&L, this campus has
been no exception.

Legally, a wallet rape occurs any
time a man is forced against his bet-
ter judgment to spend money on a
woman or when he is incapable of
making a decision about how much
money to spend. Although wallet
rape is illegal, it is difficult to prove
in court, and most men are too em-
barrassed to file charges.

“Statistics show that about 80 per-
cent of all college women could be in-
dicted on wallet-rape charges,” said

Associate Dean of Students Anne
C.P. Schroer. ‘‘Women clearly are
making great strides in gaining
equality against these  over-
aggressive, sex-driven males.”’

‘Most men think, ‘No, it couldn’t
happen to me. I’m too much of a
stud,’” said IFC President Chris Sax-
man, who has admitted to having
been wallet-raped on more than one
oocasion. ‘‘Perhaps this program
will help them understand that it
even happens to guys like me.”’

Wallet rapes may occur when
either men or women are trying to
get some action. Both types have oc-
turred on this campus.

“It was terrible,’ said Hugh Get-
nun, a junior engineering major from
Wheeling, W.Va., as he recounted the
time he was wallet-raped.

“I'd spent loads on this chick. I
bought her flowers, took her out to
dinner, took her to a movie, bought
some booze. We're talkin’ an easy 60
bucks. I deserved to get some,
y know?

“So we went back to my room, put
on some music and fooled around.
Pretty soon we were in bed, naked.
Slowly, she began kissing my neck
and working her way down, inch by
inch. She ran her fingers slowly
across my chest and then down my
sides.

‘““Oh boy,’ I thought. ‘Here it com-
es.” I was hard as an organic test.

Bhagwan Rajneeshpuram, the In-
dian guru/cult leader who led a
group of followers numbering in the
hundreds to a small Oregon com-
munity two years ago, has announc-
ed plans to move his religious cult to
Buena Vista, Va.

If all goes according to schedule,
the Bhagwan and his followers could
arrive in the small mountain com-
munity as soon as next week.

The followers, who consist of
vagrants and hermits as well as
Bhagwan worshippers, are believed
to number around 300. Currently,
Buena Vista’s population hovers near
7,000.

Many residents of Buena Vista are
“seared and afraid” of the coming
onslaught of what they call “‘hippies,
dope addicts, and devil worship-
pers.”

Willard Templeton, 73, fears that
the Bhagwan followers will infiltrate
the local government and change
Buena Vista’s name to Bhagwan
Vista, a common rumor circulating
throughout the town.

“Them people are just different
and frankly, they scare the livin’ hell
out of me,”’ he said. Templeton said
that he had heard about the name
change from city officials in Buena
Vista.

Rajneeshpuram, who was con-
tacted while checking his baggage at
the New Delhi International Airport
in India, said he had no intentions of
changing Buena Vista’s name to
Bhagwan Vista.

“T only want to spread peace, love
and harmony throughout the Shenan-
doah Valley. Besides, we don’t have
enough people to change the name...
yet,” he chuckled.

Not all Buena Vista residents are in
fear of the soon-to-arrive cult,
however. Daisy Petals, 38, says she
“can’t wait’ to meet the Bhagwan,
adding that she hopes to join his com-
mune if possible.

“T’ve been a big fan of his for quite
some time,’’ she said. ‘I can’t
believe everyone here is so upset.
The Bhagwan only wants peace and
harmony. We should be honored that
he chose us.”’

The Bhagwan, who left the U.S.
last year after a large sex scandal hit
his Oregon commune, said he chose

Buena Vista in part because of its
proximity to his ‘favorite decadent

THE BHAGWAN

college, Washington and Lee Univer-
sity.”

“TI chose Bhagwan, er, I mean
Buena Vista because of Washington
and Lee. Spirits told me in a dream
that I must go there and reach out to
them,” he said.

Rajneeshpuram, who plans to set
up his headquarters at Southern
Seminary, said he looks forward to
throwing a ‘‘big party’’ to celebrate
his arrival.

The Bhagwan, who owns almost
100 Rolls Royce automobiles, says he
will hold a raffle and give one of the
cars away at the scheduled “big par-
ty’’ next month.

“T feel it is time to educate the
residents of Buena Vista and
Washington and Lee as to the ways of
my people,” the Bhagwan said.

 

And then right after she got past my
belly button, she picked up her head,
looked me right in the eye, shouted
‘Psyche,’ put on her clothes and left.

“Tt was like putting a stopper on a
faucet, turning on the water full-
blast, and then right when the
pressure’s about to make it explode,
turning the water off again. Wow,
what a bitch.”

Andrew D. Asholl, a senior from St
Louis, also has been wallet-raped.

“It supposedly was just a friend}y
dinner date,’ Asholl said. ‘‘Wed
planned to go out for some throwin’
food, then hit some frat parties. But
when I went to her room to get her,
there she was in a damned evening
gown. She said some friends had in-
vited us out toa nice restaurant.

“Nice and expensive. But being a
W&L gentleman, what was I suppos-
ed to do? She even made me buy her
drinks without ever offering to pay,
and then she got really horny. Now
this babe was all right for a friendly

date, but she wasn’t exactly the type |

you want to wake up with the next
morning. It was like just because I
paid out all this money, I somehow
owed her something. What a bitch.”’
Women will be admitted to the
seminar free. The cost for men is on-
ly two dollars. Those who miss the
forum will be required to do service

work in the dining hall, Schroer said. ,

protection

expanded

By LOTTA WATTS
Staff Reporter

 

The administration is taking steps
to ensure a bright future for the new ,

single-sex Washington and Lee.

The board of trustees announced '

Monday that the University’s
lighting system will be expanded to
make the campus safer for the all-
female student body.

In addition, the board has created a
new administrative position, termed
the dean of enlightenment. No one
seems to know exactly what the new

dean will be responsible for, but ad-

ministrators say they are unsure
what any of the deans do, for that
matter.

Plans are currently being discuss-
ed as to the placement of the new
lights. ‘“‘We believe a balance can be
achieved between safety and tradi-
tion,’’ said a spokesman for the
board. ‘‘The beauty of this school is
that

it can accommodate these '

changes while still retaining the °

essence of the tradition that has sus-
tained it for solong.”’

The lights installed two years ago ‘
at the advent of coeducation will be ,

replaced by ultramodern neon lights

of the type often used to illuminate ~

highways near downtown Miami.
The actual number of lights is uncer-

tain, but estimates range from 75 to |
100 for the front and back of the Col- .

onnade.

Tuition increases will be necessary
to finance the enlightenment of W&L. °
This year’s increase is expected to ,

outpace inflation by two percent.
“The board considered every

reasonable option before adopting

next year’s tuition figure,’’ outgoing

‘

president John D. Wilson said shortly ‘

after the decision was made. ‘‘But
then we decided, ‘What the hell.
They’re rich, they can afford it.’ ”’

almost 200 years with approximately
700 people, most of whom are still at-
tending W&L.

Frank Parsons, executive assis-
tant to the president, indicated that
the board has called for the removal
of several statues in its efforts to
emasculate W&L.

The first thing that must go, Par-
sons said, is the statue of George
Washington on top of Washington
Hall. Parsons said the trustees know
an artist who is willing to do a statue
of Martha relatively cheap.

Though the operation’s transac-

destroyed in a mysterious fire the
night before the trial, it is estimated
that more than 40,000 false driver’s

At $12 a piece, the group made
more than $500,000 in the six months

Urinal yields North’s shredded documents

By SAM DONALDSON
Staff Reporter

 

Professor Clark Mollenhoff has
always been noted for big things. His
journalism students can attest to
that.

Now Mollenhoff has uncovered
what may be W&L’s biggest find
since the Midwest. Some in the upper
echelon of American politics view the
Mollenhoff discovery of more than
10,000 pages of shredded documents
telating to “Iranscam”’ left by Lt.
Col. Oliver North as the next
Watergate. Initially, one thing is cer-
tain: like the man, ““Boomergate’’ is
sure to be big.

The discovery of the documents
came soon after the February 25 visit

, of North and his daughter to the

Washington and Lee campus. North

and his daughter, an applicant to
W&L, were given a tour of the cam-
pus. Enter Mollenhoff.

A former investigative reporter for
the Des Moines Register and a win-
ner of the 1958 Pulitzer Prize for na-
tional reporting, Mollenhoff was once
again true to his investigative
nature. Unbeknownst to most
students — even to North himself
— Mollenhoff trailed the former
policy-maker and his daughter from
the moment they arrived on campus
in an effort to expose the truth about
North’s visit.

His lucky break came when North
entered the men’s bathroom on the
second floor of Reid Hall. Sensing
there was something suspicious
about the unexpected stop, Mollen-
hoff discreetly followed North into
the facility and observed him shred-
ding what has been estimated to be

11,000 pages of documents into the
urinal.

Hiding himself under the sink until
North washed his hands and left,
Mollenhoff then fished out the shred-
ded documents before they were
flushed in what now seems to have
been an effort to avoid ‘“‘yellow’’ jour-
nalism.

With journalism secretary
Florence Cook providing scotch tape
and fingernail polish, Mollenhoff
literally pieced together a part of the
puzzle that Justice Department of-
ficials say may provide the missing
link to the Buena Vista bank account
that was used for funnelling money to
Sri Lanka via Boise, Idaho, that was
to be used in the contras’ battle
against gum disease in Nicaragua.

Mollenhoff refused to speculate on
the nature of the documents, citing
the ongoing closed Justice Depart-

ment investigations and a general
distrust of the press as a source of his
disillusionment with the First
Amendment.

He did, however, mention that the
recent events will be the subject of
this week’s ‘‘Retrospect, with Clark
R. Mollenhoff.”” Two books relating
Mollenhoff’s experience, Investigative
Plumbing and Ollie-n-Me, are ex-
pected to be released later this week.

North declined to comment on the
situation, citing the Fifth Amend-
ment as ‘‘as good a reason as any.”
An official statement from the White
House has not been made available,
though an anonyme "source who
asked to be identified’caly as ‘‘D’’
said that the president, when asked
about the affair, cited the Fifth
Amendment and then proceeded to
hurl epithets such as “fink” and
“‘goob”’ at an effigy of Mollenhoff.

Dome-Mania!

By JACK STRAP
Staff Reporter

 

First it was the Astrodome, and
then the Superdome, the Kingdome,
the Silverdome, the Carrier Dome
and the Dean Dome. Now comes the
irrival of a dome to end all domes

Washington and Lee Athletic
Director Bill McHenry announced
Monday that the Board of Trustees
had accepted the Athletic Depart-
ment’s proposal for the building of a
domed stadium on the W&L campus.
he construction of the new stadium,
to be called the GeneralsDome, was
started Monday and will continue at
break-neck speed for the next six
months. The site for the dome will
cover the area in which Liberty Hall,
Smith Field and the Student Ac-
tivities Pavilion are now located.

“This (the GeneralsDome] will be
awesome,’’ exclaimed McHenry, get-
ting a tad bit excited about the
limitless athletic possibilities the
dome offers. ‘It’s going to have
every technological advancement
that you could possibly imagine.”

Some features of the new dome,
which will cost $900 million, include a
150,000 person seating capacity, a
retractable roof which will allow for
the installation of a natural grass
playing surface, an indoor shopping
mall, a 24-lane bowling alley, a roller
skating rink, an olympic-size swim-
ming pool, 17 hot tubs, a massage
parlor, and offices and equipment for
the entire W&L athletic department
staff.

“We are going to have some ab-
solutely incredible athletic and even
social events at our dome,’’ said
McHenry. ‘I have already sent in our
applications to host the 1991 NCAA
Final Four basketball tournament,

the 1993 Super Bowl, and the 1992
World Cup soccer finals.

‘Hell, we may even have the Olym-
pics here if we can pull a few
strings.”

NCAA officials refused to confirm
whether or not the GeneralsDome
would be chosen as a Final Four site
but did say that Lexington was “‘high
on our list considering the facilities it
will be able to provide.”

The flexibility of the dome will be
exploited to its fullest, said McHenry,
as many athletic and non-athletic
events are on the slate for the upcom-
ing year. The schedule for the 1987-88
school year contains such activities

as: World Wrestling Federation’s
“Wrestlemania IV’’; women’s mud
wrestling; super moto-cross;

monster truck competition; SABaid
— a rock concert featuring Genesis,
The Who, The Rolling Stones, Bruce
Springsteen and many other per-
formers with all proceeds going to
the financially strapped Student Ac-
tivities Board; Ringling Bros. Bar-
num and Bailey Circus; box
lacrosse; and a special edition of the
popular game show ‘Wheel of For-
tune.”’

“T’m sick and tired of hearing com-
plaints about how there is nothing to
do around here,”’ said President John
D. Wilson. ‘I think this will definitely
liven things up and provide some
diverse entertainment for the W&L
community.”’

With 150,000 seats to fill and a cur-
rent student enrollment of only 1,700,
fans will have to come from
somewhere other than the Lexington
and Rockbridge area.

“No problem,’’ said McHenry.
‘With all W&L sports to be held in the
dome [except cross-country and ten-
nis], the other athletic fields and
buildings can be converted for other
purposes.’

who travel by car, Route 60 will be
widened to six lanes from the

GeneralsDome to Route 64 to help

“The changes will take time,’’ said
McHenry, ‘‘but if everything goes as
planned, we're looking at a great
number of people marking Lex-
ington, Virginia on their vacation
agendas.”’

Student reactions to the complete

overhaul of W&L athletics were
somewhat mixed.

“I think it’s pretty cool,” said
sophomore Harry M. Eye III. “I’ve
never seen women’s mud wrestling
before but I hear it’s degrading to

women. I want to check that stuff
out.”’

“What’s the point in having a

dome?”’ asked freshman Art Phagg.
“T wish they would use the money for

something more worthwhile, like a |

new theatre.”

“Let’s hope they can serve beer
there without some garden or what-
not,’’ said sophomore Jimmy Slush.
“I’m tired of not being able to down a
few cold ones while I’m watching my

Washington and Lee ends the Division Ill ‘charade’

 

By STEELE TRAVERS
Staff Reporter

 

In an emergency meeting held last
weekend the Washington and Lee
Board of Trustees decided that, ef-
fective in the next academic year, all
W&L athletic teams will compete in
Division I.

Concurrent with this decision, the
trustees also announced that W&L
will reinstitute athletic scholarships
beginning in the fall of 1987.

“We held the emergency meeting
at the request of [W&L] president
{John D.] Wilson,’ explained a
trustee who asked not to be iden-
tified. “It seems that he saw the
president of SMU talking on T.V.
about how much money Division I

athletics had brought into his school.

“He [Wilson] felt that it would be
best for W&L to be in a position to
make as much money as SMU and
the trustees agreed with him.”’

Wilson declined to specify how the
University would spend the addi-
tional money but he hinted that there
would be immediate benefit to the
general student population. ‘‘I think
we could expand the menu in the Co-
op,” said Wilson.

The decision took most of the W&L
community by surprise, including
most of the coaches. Still, reaction in
the athletic department was, for the
most part, positive.

“It’s about time,’ said W&L
Athletic Director Bill McHenry. ‘TI
was getting tired of pussyfooting
around in Division III.”’

Huskers ‘shucked’ as
darters wing way to win

 

By HANS HACKER-PSCHORR
staff Reporter

 

With most of its Old Dominion
Athletic Conference games still left
to play, the Washington and Lee lawn
jarts team is looking for one of its
vest finishes ever. The Generals (4-0,
2-0 in ODAC games) seem to have
hings well under control, already
securing wins against ODAC powers
toanoke and Emory & Henry, as
yell as a shocking 6-3 victory over
he nationally ranked, and previously
inbeaten, Nebraska Cornhuskers
esterday at Wilson Field.

Generals head coach Norm Lord
vas elated after yesterday’s surprise
rictory over Nebraska. The Corn-
iuskers were ranked fifth in the
VCAA Division I poll which was
eleased on Tuesday afternoon.

“They [the Cornhuskers] only
layed us because they had a slot to
ill on their schedule,”’ said Lord.
They brought their air-conditioned
us and their number-five ranking to
exington, only to see our boys turn
he match into a highlight film!”

The Generals set the tone for the
iatch early in the first game. Both
on Thornton and Skip Bertram con-
‘ibuted crucial ringers that allowed
/&L to take the first game 21-6 and
stablish an initial lead.

“IT knew then that we had a

vance,’’ said Bertram. ‘““They were

»viously frustrated and we got them

it of their game plan.”

The General wingers won the next
vo games and then the teams split
ie next two to make the score of the

atch 4-1

The Cornhuskers then staged a ral-

which almost robbed the young
enerals of the victory. Scraping by
ith a combined score of 42-37, the

braska team took the next two

making the score of the

atch 4-3. The Generals seemed to
slipping

Then a loud outburst from Lord

mes

electrified the crowd of approximate-
ly 7,100 and caused an emotional
turning point.

‘‘What I said was that we were still
in the thing,” said Lord. ‘‘They were
going to get hot dogs and they were
going to the toilets. Some were even
leaving. It was pride time. We need-
ed them behind us!”’

With the yells of the crowd, and the
occasional ‘‘wave’’ to cheer them on,
the Generals crushed Nebraska in
the final two games and took the
match 6-3.

It was a victory reminiscent of the
“glory years”’ for W&L lawn darting
in the 1950s. Those were the days
when the Generals ruled the sport as
the nation’s premier Division I pro-
gram.

“God bless the Lord and this fine
group of men,” said a teary-eyed
Vince Dunhill. Dunhill was the cap-
tain of the 1953 Generals team that
captured the national championship.

“They played with their hearts on
their sleeves. It [watching the
General victory] made me proud to
be an American,”’ he said as several
thousand jubilant fans swarmed the
field to congratulate the General
wingers.

Although pre-season conference
polls ranked the Generals at No. 4
they will be the favorites entering the
remainder of their scheduled ODAC
contests, because of their excep-
tionally strong start against quality
teams.

Lord attributes the team’s success
to superior conditioning, a lack of
serious injuries, and understanding
of ‘‘simple trajectory’’ that is so im-
portant in lawn darting.

The Generals will face their
toughest ODAC challenge next week
when they travel to Farmville for the
traditional showdown with Hamp-
den-Sydney

“Our main goal, of course, is to
win,’”’ said Lord, ‘‘but it sure would
be nice to pay those suckers back by
spoiling their homecoming.”

field felt that the move was long over-
due. ‘‘I just can’t wait to put W&L
back on the Division I basketball
map. I’ve been just aching for a
chance to take that [North Carolina
head coach] Dean Smith down a
notch or two.”’

Some coaches, however, did ex-
press concern.

Said head football coach Gary
Fallon, ‘“‘Considering the decision to
go all female [see story, page one], I
thought that it would be hard enough
to field a winning football team in
Division III.

‘‘But in Divison I, with no men, it’s
going to be near to impossible. All I
can hope is that we’ll get a bunch of
transfers from Mary Baldwin.”

Even Dean Buddy Atkins had
something to say about the change.
“This ?!$?$?! Division III charade

 

The returning starters can still
remember the tough loss to
Hampden-Sydney last year that
dashed the Generals’ hopes for a
possible NCAA play-off berth.

“That loss still keeps me awake
some nights,”’ said co-captain John
Packett, a junior from Salem, Va.

But, he added, ‘‘the coaches have
done a super job in prepping us for
those. matches. They show us weak-
nesses when we look at the game
films, and we have been able to key

Skip Bertram lets one fly and...

has gone on long enough. It’s about
!2$2$?! time that someone did
something.”

For those who haven’t heard the
story, W&L competed in Division I
until the mid-1950s when a scandal
within the athletic department made
the school decide to discontinue
athletic scholarships. Then, when the
National Collegiate Athletic Associa-
tion created a division for schools
that didn’t award scholarships —
Division III — W&L joined almost
immediately.

“I was very excited when I heard
that the decision had been made,”
said McHenry, ‘‘but now it’s down to
the business of recruiting.

“I’m heading west with a bagful of
scholarships on Monday. There’s this
one swimmer from Duluth who says

on these weaknesses. There have
been very few surprises.”

The match will be held next Satur-
day afternoon at 3 p.m.

**WINGER RINGERS * *

With 42 points in yesterday’s game,
Bertram has reached No. 3 on the
W&L all-time leading scorers list
with 15,389. He needs only 736 more
points to pass Reginald “Whizzer”
Gillispie, who holds the mark with
16,124.

she’ll come here if we give her a con-
do at Borden Commons. I’m going to
try to talk her down to a suite in
Gaines Hall.”’

When asked if there could be a
repeat of the type of scandal that
originally caused the school to drop
scholarships, McHenry replied, ‘No
way, We’ve learned our lesson.”’

Student reaction to the move was
immediate and positive. Cotton
Smithers, a junior from Atlanta, Ga.,
said, ‘‘This will be great. Maybe now
we can get some real tailgate par-
ties.”

Jones Baker, a freshman from
Louisville, Ky., said, ‘“‘Now that
we’re Division I and all, I think it’s
about time that we got some
cheerleaders. I think that it would
boost attendance if we saw some

cheese in skimpy costumes.”’

Georgia Harper, a sophomore from
Jessup, Tenn., said, ‘It was only a
matter of time until something like
this happened. I just hope Daddy
sends me enough money for season
tickets.”

Some students, however, did ex-
press reservations.

Said Leonard TuBright, a junior
from Plainfield, Kan., ‘Does this
mean that the debating team will go
Division I also? It would be really
neat if we got to go to the national
finals in Morgantown, W.Va.”’

In conjunction with the Division I
decision, the trustees also voted to
begin construction on a new multi-
million dollar stadium to be called
the GeneralsDome [see story on this
page].

The big guns were out last night at
Cy Twombly pool for the 23rd
Washington and Lee Invitational
Bellyflop Contest.

More than 850 people crowded into
the pool gallery to watch some of the
sport’s biggest narhes compete for
the $25,000 first-place prize.

Robert D. “Stringbean’” deMaria
walked away with the big purse, for
the fourth time in as many years, by
winning both the compulsory and
free-style competitions with two
perfect scores of 10.

“Obviously I’m very happy about
winning the money,’’ deMaria said,
“but this was some of the toughest
competition I’ve seen in years.”

Competition figured to be tight this
year with the re-emergence of John
‘“‘Bubba’”’ Packett. Packett, a junior,
tore a stomach muscle in the contest

because of our exposure on TV game
shows.”

Miller, who had earlier estimated
the playing fields would be ready for
action by the fall season, said he saw
no reason why the University
wouldn’t sell the fields.

“(The University] would be crazy
not to,”’ said Miller. ‘‘There’s no con-
ceivable way those fields will be
ready in time for the fall sports
season.

“Besides that, the University
would turn a nice profit on the whole
deal, Rice-a-Roni is offering $600,000
and the fields only cost us about 170
grand.”

Chung said the company wants the
fields because of their ‘incredible
ability to hold water for a long period
of time.” Rice grows extremely well
in wet environments.

$100,000.

“It will be a good experience for
us,’’ said head coach Bill Washburn,
whose team finished with a 1-9 record
last year. “The girls will benefit
greatly from playing against the dif-
ferent international style.’ The
Europeans play mainly from the
baseline while Washburn says the
Generals go with the “serve and
volley” power game.

“This is not going to be a vacation.
We plan to play tennis and lots of it.
I’ve already scheduled two half-hour
practice sessions.”

The University said last year’s ex-
cursion was paid for by the athletic
department because the team, in just
its first year of existence, didn’t have
enough time in the fall to raise funds.
This season, however, the women did
partake in some money-making ac-
tivities.

‘‘We sold bumper stickers and can-
dy bars but we came up just a little
bit short of our goal,’’ said
sophomore Valerie Pierson. ‘‘We
also had a car wash and cookie-and-

“The drainage systems on these
fields are remarkable,” said Chung.
“One most fields of this type, the
water would run right off. But in this
case, the water reamins for months
ata time.

“One rainfall could conceivably
carry us through an entire growing
season.”

The fields were supposed to pro-
vide scheduling and practice flex-
ibility for the numerous W&L athletic
teams and clubs. Miller stated
earlier the fields would be ‘‘techno-
logically advanced” and contain
superior water-drainage systems.

“T don’t know what exactly went
wrong, but the University comes out
over $400,000 richer for the mishap,”’
he said. ‘‘I think I’ll spend my share
on a trip to the Bahamas.”

cake-bake sale during the second
week of October.”’

The squad raised $62.31 for its ef-
forts, so the University decided to
“step in” and provide a “‘little help.”

‘We Want only the best for our
women’s athletic teams,’’ said
Athletic Director Bill McHenry. “In
order for us to become the best, we
have to play against the best.

“The men’s teams are already
established so we have to show some
favoritism towards the women. I see
nothing wrong with this trip in terms
of unfairness to the other teams. The
baseball and lacrosse teams go to
Florida every year, right?”

According to Sports Information
Director Mark Mandel, the decision
to pay the tennis team’s way was a
unanimous one.

“| think it’s a great idea,”’ he said.
“Besides, the women really looked

ferson ‘‘J-Bone”’ Harralson.

deMaria, who has won the contest
eight of the last 11 years, was the ob-
vious crowd favorite. Emerging from
the lockerroom in pink flowered
Jams, deMaria was met with the
chant ‘“‘Stringbean, Stringbean’’
from the capacity crowd.

Working from the three-meter
board, the competition opened with
the compulsory round. In the com-
pulsories, each bellyflopper is ex-
pected to execute to perfection three
dives: the swan-dive bellyflop, the
cannonball and a flip with a horizon-
tal landing.

Shillington was the first diver and
executed a perfect swan-dive belly-
flop. As he has done since the first
meet in 1964, Shillington dove in his
trademark outfit of cut-off jeans and
what he calls his ‘good luck
Hawaiian shirt.”

The remainder of the compulsories
was mundane, with the exception of
deMaria’s three perfect dives. Har-
ralson was disqualified after the
compulsory round for not meeting
the mandatory eight-inch water
displacement requirement.

“‘T figured I'd do really well in the
compulsories,”’ said Mollenhoff, ‘‘but
Stringbean really tore up those
dives.”’

bs tal
Ne 4
a

“Geez, I’ve never seen anyone dive
like that,”’ said Packett. ‘‘I think Str-
ingbean must be possessed.’

After the compulsories, deMaria
was in first place with a score of 10,
followed by Shillington (9.6), Packett
(9.2), Horridge (8.7), Drake (8.5) and
Mollenhoff (6.4).

“T guess I'll have to bring out my
best stuff early in the freestyle if I
stand a chance of catching up with
Stringbean,’’ Mollenhoff said.

Three freestyle competition is
what brings the crowds back year
after year. Each diver is allowed
three dives in which to prove his ar-
tistic flair, originality and water
displacement ability.

“The compulsories are all right,’
said observer Greg Louganis, ‘“‘but
what I really come to see is these
fellas get off in the freestyles.”

Mollenhoff opened the freestyle
round with an amazing “double back
flip flop’”’ that earned him a near-
perfect score of 9.9. Drake matched
that score with an inverted flip with 2
1/2 twists and an amazing 12-inch
water displacement.

Packett was the day’s leader in
water displacement and Horridge’s
originality won him the admiration of
many of the fans.

“After watcning Suringbean dive, I
knew I didn’t have a prayer,” Hor-
ridge said. ‘‘I look at the competition
today as a learning experience. I'll
be back next year with more polished
compulsories and a few new dives for
the freestyles.’’

deMaria, it seems, never looked
back after establishing his lead in the
compulsories. His first dive, a double
flip with a half-twist, earned him his
fourth of six perfect 10’s and
restarted the ‘‘Stringbean’’ chant.

His second dive, called by bellyflop
experts the best in history, was a tri-
ple inward flip with three twists and
a water displacement of 14 inches.

“‘T knew I had it sewn up with that
dive,’’ deMaria said later.

A double back flip by deMaria end-
ed the day’s competition and earned
him the $25,000 purse. Mollenhoff
made an amazing comeback in the
freestyles and finished second with a
score of 9.9.

Following Mollenhoff were Packett
(9.75), Horridge (9.43), Shillington
(9.167) and Drake (9.03).

Shillington said this might be his
last year but added, ‘‘Hell, I’ve been
saying that for the last 12 years.”

Next year’s circuit opens up with
the Southern California Tournament
in Pasadena on Nov. 17.

FD plans announced

 

wee
By EARNEST PUDDING
Entertainment Editor

 

According to Glynn Alexander,
head of the Student Activities Board,
Fancy Dress preparations are
already well under way

With an estimated budget of $4.6
million, the SAB plans to throw one
bally-hoo of a Fancy Dress next year
Not only are top-flight acts going to
be signed, but also new, more
elaborate themes are being propos-
ed

“Basically, we plan to throw a Fan-

y Dress that will definitely prompt
the board of trustees to withdraw ab-
solutely all their support,’ Alex-
ander said. ‘‘At least that’s our inten-
tion. If Washington and Lee ever has
another Fancy Dress, then we will
have failed. I mean, hey, it’s our last
year as a coed institution.”

Next year’s exorbitant budget is
the result of the hard work of newly
elected SAB money-raisers Oral
Roberts and Bedroom Athlete Jim
Bakker. Roberts used a particularly
novel fund raising technique where
he said in a news release that he
would kill himself violently with a
‘hainsaw if he raises more than $3
million.

“The response was incredible,”
Alexander said. ‘‘Calls and pledges
just kept pouring in. Everyone kept
saying something about ‘the Lord’s
work.’ I don’t know. God must really
love W&L.”’

Already, the SAB has managed to
sign Zamphyr and his beautiful Pan
Flute as the Thursday night act
Opening band will be Bon Jovi and
his wooden arm

In addition, the ball will be held in
the newly erected GeneralsDome

As for beer, Alexander regreted
that no alcoholic beverages will be
allowed at the ball.

‘We're just trying to do our part to
cut down on all the drunk driving,”’
Alexander said.

However, crack, heroin and co-
caine are welcome narcotic embell-
ishments

“We just want people to have a
good time,’’ Alexander added.

The SAB has already selected a
number of proposed F'D themes.

At the top of the list is “Swamp
Thing.’ The GeneralsDome will be
turned into a steaming quagmire
complete with corpses obtained from
the Roanoke morgue and real live
alligators slithering through the

knee-deep water.

 

 

en yy

Next is ‘‘My Favorite Shades of
Blue.’ Alexander was somewhat
obscure on the details of this pro-
posal.

“A Nightmare on Elm Street,”’ is
currently an SAB favorite. A ‘“‘run for
your life and make sure you take it
easy on your intake of hallucin-
ogenics”’ affair, Alexander hopes to
decrease drastically the number of
anti-SAB sympathizers with this one

For “A Night in El Salvador,”
Alexander plans to recreate the over-
whelming impact of the recent hit
movie, Platoon.

“Only, it will be more real, I guess
you could say,’ Alexander added
vaguely.

With the advent of an all-woman
W&L, the SAB has picked out several
themes appropriate for this new
move. They include “A Night at
Hugh Hefner’s,’’ “Slumber Party”
and ‘‘Panty Raid!”’

But that’s not all. Still in the works
are plans for a ‘‘Famous Siamese
Twin Motorcycle Dare-Devil Team”
Fancy Dress Ball, as well as ‘‘An
Evening with the Spanish Inquisi-
tion.”

“As you can see, this is no wimp-
out, half-assed ball,’’ Alexander said.
‘Come at your own risk.”’

The Beatles

New group could make it

guess you really gotta hear it to
believe it.
Apparently, I’m not the only one

 

By TAMI JUNE LETTERBUTT
Pop Music Critic

 

Bon Jovi is probably the best rock
and roll band in the world. Hey, let’s
face it: they might be the best there
ever was. I don’t need to tell you that,
but this might interest you. I heard a
record by a new English band that,
though they might not be better than
Bon Jovi, could very well prove to be
better than, say, Duran Duran. Or
Boston.

They are called the Beatles and
they hail from Liverpool. Now, they
are obviously riding on the tailcoats
of that other Liverpool band, Frankie
Goes To Hollywood (although this
new band’s album covers aren’t
nearly as cool), but that isn’t quite
fair since the Beatles don’t have a
synthesizer player, as hard as that
might be to believe. Neither does
Frankie Goes To Hollywood, by the
way, but who says a pop group should
have to play their own instruments?

These Beatles evidently do play
their instruments, though, according
to the liner notes of their new album,
Meet The Beatles. (It was just releas-
ed on CD, tbough the sound quality is
strange — like it’s all coming from
one speaker or something.) It’s just
guitars and drums, sort of like U2 or
Stryper, but less... loud, I guess.
Weirdest thing is the way the drums
are recorded — as if the drummer
were in another room. And the
guitars, come to think of it, are pretty
strange, too: so quiet. It makes me
wonder how they expect to play these
songs on video. I mean, the drum-
mer’s so mellow and all, it doesn’t
sound like he can hold his hand over
his head and crash down on the snare
drum with his hair flying, which he’ll
have to do if he’s going to be on a rock
video, as we all very well know. And
how are these guitarists going to
grimace with pain if there aren’t any
loud solos?

But these are minor problems on a
really cool record. The first song, ‘‘I
Want To Hold Your Hand,’’ sounds
like it could be a real hit. It sounds
sort of like the Romantics, or maybe
Men At Work, what with the hand-
clapping and all. Another song, ‘‘Till
There Was You,” reminds me of my
very favorite band, Spandau Ballet.
It’s the ballad and it is almost as good
as ‘‘True.”’ Of course, it isn’t surpris-
ing that they remind me of Spandau
Ballet, because their look — short
hair, nice suits, clean shaves — is ob-
viously lifted from the Spandaus.

Several of these guys are really
cute, by the way. One, named Paul
McCartney, is particularly cute and
could rival Duran Duran’s John
Taylor as the cutest bass player in
rock.

The whole record is great. The
songs keep going around and around
in my head, and the lyrics seem
halfway intelligent. Which is okay,
because I like them anyway. In fact,
I’m kind of at a loss about why I do
like them so much. It sort of sounds
like everything else these days, but
somehow more... more thought out. I
don’t know. And another strange
thing is that you can really dance to it
even though it isn’t Dance Music. I

who likes the Beatles. According to
the liner notes, they are huge in

Deja vu, as the floods strike again.

Leaks and clogs reign

By STACY MORRISON
Staff Reporter

 

 

 

The heavy rains that fell upon the
Lexington area last week did not
cause extensive damages, said
Harold L. Conklin of the Rockbridge
County Department of Parks and Ad-
ministration. ‘‘Mostly, there was just
a lot of debris that had to be cleared.
The flooding was minimal,”’ he add-
ed. The water came up over the roads
by Rockbridge Bay and Furr’s Mill,
elaborated Conklin.

Lexington City Manager Joe King
also said that the damage was

A Washington and Lee professor
who specializes on the history of the
papacy has taken issue with recent
attempts to compare the current feud
among television evangelists with
battles between secular leaders and
popes during the Middle Ages.

“It’s the most idiotic comparison
that could be made,” said Jefferson
Davis Futch III, professor of history.
“It’s the most comical analogy I’ve
ever seen attempted.”

Futch was referring to a statement
attributed to Jim Bakker’s attorney
Norman Roy Grutman, who was
quoted as saying, ‘‘It was like this in
the time of the Holy Roman Empire
and such power struggles were true
in days of the medieval popes.’’

Bakker gained national attention
when he resigned as head of the PTL
ministry in the midst of a sexual
misconduct scandal. His lawyer later
alleged that rival evangelist Jimmy
Swaggart was seeking to take over
the ministry.

“There were struggles involving
the medieval papacy,’”’ Futch con-
ceded, ‘‘but other, less frivolous
issues were at stake. There’s no
parallel at all.

“T think that these evangelists are
con artists who care nothing about
religion. In the Middle Ages religion
was taken seriously by everyone.

minimal. ‘‘There was no damage
beyond a few flooded basements due
to runoff from yards and streets.
Also, some private bridges were
washed away, and some streets were
temporarily blocked due to flood-
ing,” King said.

There were no problems at Goshen
Pass, Conklin said, adding that the
flood of November ’85 occurred after
approximately 11 inches of rain had
fallen. Conklin approximated that on-
ly six to seven inches fell this week in
rains that started Tuesday and con-
tinued on and off for three days.

measure, but that happened more
because they were shell-shocked
from last year’s floods,’ Conklin
said

As for the effects of the rain on
Washington and Lee, W. Scott Beebe,
assistant superintendent of Buildings
and Grounds, said the only damages
were ‘‘minor roof leaks and clogged
drains — the same things that hap-
pen with every heavy rain.”’ He add-
ed that the rains were “hard, not
severe like the flood rains last year.
We at B&G just handled it like a nor-
mal heavy rain. It really wasn’t
much like November '85."’

Futch refutes comical analogy

Something as ludicrous as_ this
episode would never have occurred
then, and the very effort to draw a
comparison only makes it clearer
how little there is in common,
“That’s not to say the medieval
popes were Boy Scouts,”’ Futch add-
ed. ‘There were plenty of controver-
sies, often revolving around money.
The difference is that the popes of the
Middle Ages were at the very summit

Hooks and dogs

Hartog ploughs through applications

Hooks and dogs.

They were the kiss of death at
Washington and Lee University this
year.

The young man from Minnesota,
for instance, had one vote to accept
him and one to wait and see his latest
senior grades.

“He’s OK,” William Hartog, W&L
admissions director, commented to
his associates as he casually glanced
through the young man’s file.

Then something caught his eye like
a sharp stick.

“Oh, lots of hooks and dogs,’ he
said, a hint of distress in his tone.
‘‘He’s out. Not a Washington and Lee
transcript.”

Hooks and dogs. College admis-
sions talk for C’s and D's

Top students don’t make C’s, Har-
tog said. He scribbled his initials on
the ‘“‘Reject’’ line inside the folder
and tossed it to the floor. It landed
with a gentle plop next to his left foot.

The reject pile grew with the files
of high school students whose scores
were too low, whose grades had too
many C’s, whose high ability scores
and spotty grades indicated a lack of
motivation.

Underachievers. Everyone groan-
ed. W&L didn’t need them this year,
thanks.

“T can’t stand underachievers,”’
Hartog said. ‘‘I love to take a chance
on a kid who works hard and pro-
duces.”’

Hartog picked up another folder
The record showed the applicant was
making a surge in his senior year.
Everyone had read it and the name
was familiar.

“TL, TL,’’ someone said. ‘Too lit-
tle, too late.”

of European politics. They habitually
dealt with kings and emperors all the
time.”’

Futch continued, ‘These evan-
gelists are on the periphery, and they
deal with the ignorant and the
superstitious. The great and power-
ful of the world don’t pay any atten-
tion to them. The popes were indeed
money-grubbers, but they were at
the heart of everything.”’

Scribble, scribble, plop.

But Hartog and his colleagues
could hardly contain their glee when
a file of a senior who had it all — high
scores, top grades in tough courses,
special talents and leadership
—crossed their desks.

They realized that many of the best
students also had applied to the
University of Virginia, the College of
William and Mary, Harvard, Prince-
ton, Duke and many other
prestigious and selective schools also
salivating over these academic
records.

“What you don’t know is how many
colleges an applicant has applied to,”
Hartog said as he and his staff began
reviewing stacks of applications in
January. “Of course, the stronger
the candidate, the more options he
has. We’re loaded. We have tons of
very able kids.”’

GPAs not

reliable

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Assignments Editor

 

If you just made the honor roll for
the first time in your life or saw your
academic eligibility go down the
drain when you read your Winter
Term report card, you'd better look
again.

The term and cumulative grade-
point averages on the Winter Term
grade reports are unreliable, accord-
ing to Washington and Lee Registrar
Scott Dittman.

Letter grades on the report cards
are accurate, Dittman said.

“The printed grade reports are
reliable only for individual course
grades for the term,’’ Dittman wrote
in an April 16 memorandum to
parents, students, faculty and staff.
“Total credits and grade-point
averages, both term and cumulative,
are not accurate and should not be
used for any determination of
eligibility or honors. When the com-

Old batch

puter problem is identified and fixed,
grade-point averages, ranks and
honors will be recalculated and
distributed.”’

The problem was caused by a new
edition of W&L’s computer software,
which the school received in January
from the Datatel Corp. of Arlington,
Dittman said.

“‘We know how to fix it and we are
able to fix it, but we want to know
why it happened,”’ Dittman said.

Dittman first became aware of the
problem last Wednesday, when
Robert L. Powley, a junior from Glen
Rock, N.J., noticed a discrepancy on
his grade report.

Students who want to recalculate
their cumulative grades should
check their Fall Term grade reports,
which are accurate, Dittman said.

New grade reports will not be
printed up because the registrar’s of
fice has no more grade-report forms,
Dittman said. He did not know when
the corrected information would be
made available.

From Staff Reports

 

Registration for fall classes at
Washington and Lee University will
again utilize the batch method of
course sectioning. The on-line com-
puter registration system, tried for
the first time in February for spring
registration, will not be used.

“T believe an on-line system can be
developed to meet W&L’s needs,”
said D. Scott Dittman, university
registrar, ‘‘but at this time it is more
important to minimize the frustra-
tion and unhappiness felt by some
students and faculty members.
There is simply not enough time be-
tween now and May 4 to solve some of
the problems with on-line registra-
tion. The system we will use is the
one with which students and faculty
are most familiar.”’

Registration for the fall term will
be May 4.

Dittman said he met with the facul
ty Registration and Class Schedules
Committee, the faculty Executive
Committee, the student body Ex
ecutive Committee, and the chair
men of the academic departments to
discuss the registration situation
The discussions with those groups,
Dittman said, led to the conclusion
that the on-line system ‘challenged
our notions of how registration
should be accomplished.”

“The February registration was
always intended as a trial run of the
system, to understand how a dif-
ferent system might work and what
issues might be raised by having a
computer do more of the clerical or
technical work,’’ he said. ‘The test
provided us with much-needed evi-
dence for planning how many
courses should be offered and how
enrollments might be limited.”’

Additional information for fall
registration should be available to
students by May 1.

Hartog cites mistakes

in story

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Assignments Editor

 

This week’s Phi includes two
lengthy articles about Washington
and Lee’s admissions process. The
articles, which have been reprinted
from the April 5 issue of the
{Roanoke Times & World-News],
give a fairly accurate description of
Washington and Lee’s admissions
process, according to William Har-
tog, director of admissions at W&L.

Hartog did say, however, that he
thought the articles made the admis-
sions staff seem rather glib and ar-
rogant. He also cited two factual er-
rors that were in the original articles.

According to the original stories,
there are fewer Jews than blacks at
WA&L. That is incorrect.

The stories also implied that the
sons and daughters of alumni — who
are known as legacies — have little
chance of being admitted if they are
placed on the wait list. That is not
true. Hartog said that if a legacy on
the wait list tells the admissions of-
fice that W&L is his or her first
choice, then that student will be ad-
mitted automatically. That is not the
case for non-legacies.

Legacies, minorities and Rock-
bridge County residents all are con-
sidered outside of the normal admis-
sions pool, Hartog said. They are in
special categories created by the
board of trustees.

He said that of the 194 sons and
daughters of alumni who applied this
year, 106 were admitted. Legacies
have about twice as good a chance of
being accepted as non-legacies.

W&L has accepted 29 of 43 minority
applications, and three of four ap
plications from Rockbridge County
residents.

Hartog had mostly compliments
for Roanoke reporter Jack Chamber-
lain, who sat in on admissions
meetings almost weekly from
January through March.

Hartog said Chamberlain ‘saw
everything. We didn’t shield a thing
from him.”

But he also said the articles may
have provided too simplistic a view
of the admissions process. Readers
may have regarded the decisions as
having been made after only cursory
glances at the files.

“In some instances we were por
trayed as rather glib,’’ Hartog said

“Jack witnessed the weekly
culmination of an extraordinary
review. What Jack didn’t do was
carry the files home with us every
night and every weekend.”’

Chamberlain was on vacation this
week and could not be reached for
comment.

Hartog said the articles were
especially good because they gave
current high school students the
chance to look inside an admissions
office and showed them what an ex
tremely competitive admissions of
fice would require,

“Local residents have reacted very
positively toit,”’ Hartog said.

He said one of the most important
statistics included in the articles was
that W&L rejected 47 percent of the
applicants with verbal SAT scores
above 600 and 57 percent of those with
math scores above 600. This shows
that W&L is concerned about more

Shhhhhhhhh

Judging from the state of the University Library during
winter term exams, Washington and Lee seems to have a
new “‘party barn.”’

During a week that should be devoted to serious study by
most students, the library became a social hide-a-way.
Wherever one tried to study the combined vocal efforts of
numerous people became a roar that made concentration for
study nearly impossible. This was not conduct one would ex-
pect from ‘honorable’ W&L students.

Although there are some private rooms for student’s use,
there are not enough of them to handle the demand when
finals week comes around. Therefore, students have to de-
pend on the library as a quiet academic retreat. It is rude, un-
fair and ridiculous for other students to interfere with some-
one’s studies.

The university needs to find ways to control student con-
duct in the library. Hopefully a solution, less drastic than
library proctors or the end of 24 hour access, will be found
before the next finals period begins.

Even though one can hope for an end to obtrusive noise in
the library, one must realize that until students act maturely,
the problem will continue. One would think that at a school
that places such a high priority on honor, maturity would be a
prerequisite.

Misrepresentation

Each year during orientation, freshmen learn about the
Honor System from E.C. members during a special meeting.
The new W&L students are encouraged to ask questions. In-
vary someone asks, “‘Is using a fake I.D. an honor viola-
tion?”’

When the Class of 1989, now in their sophomore year, asked
that question, they were met with another question: ‘“‘Do you
think it would be one?”’ Students were advised that if they

need to ask if something is an honor violation, they were bet-
ter off not doing it.

When this year’s freshman class asked that question, it
was told that any instances of W&L students using fake I.D.s
would be investigated as a possible honor violation.

The White Book suggests examples of dishonorable
behavior as lying, cheating and stealing. The very name
“fake I.D.” suggests lying or fraud. One who uses a fake I.D.
is misrepresenting himself. This is clearly lying.

We do not suggest that drinking under age or being served
alcohol although the drinker is not yet 21 is an honor viola-
tion. However, using a fake I.D. or verbally lying about one’s
age goes against the honor code.

Students at W&L pride themselves on their honor, but they
must realize one cannot be honorable only on certain occas-
sions or in certain places. Honor is a way of life, not
something to be put on when we reach campus and taken off
before we enter a bar or go on vacation.

Farley asks Robins to

 

MY VIEW
By Mark Farley

 

Mr. Robins, will you please give us
a rest. For weeks now, you have
berated us with your arguments for
turning back the clock and returning
Washington and Lee to an all-male
institution. The community (es-
pecially the readers of ‘‘The Ring-

ing stoically, but we are beginning to
need a break badly. A respite from

respect your right to voice your
personal opinions, but can’t you see
that your cause is without hope? You
ran for president of the student body
on an anti-coeducation platform and
lost. Why don’t you accept that as a
rejection of your ideas (which it is so
clearly) by the students?
The next week you went on to re-

A ‘gentleman’ is defined

 

MY VIEW
By Steve Baldridge

 

I have been troubled this year. As
we talk about the future of our school,
it seems that we are failing to ad-
dress an issue of utmost importance.
We glibly toss out the words
“rights,”’ “traditions,” and ‘‘Honor
System” without examining their
meanings or implications to our-
selves and future students. Most cen-
tral to the issue is the question,
“What is a gentleman (or a lady)?”

I imagine a gentleman as having
certain basic traits. He would be no-
ble — kind and courageous. As
Robert E. Lee envisioned him, he
must be honorable. And, as we can
all agree, he is an ideal. Still, that vi-
sion of an ideal man has spawned a
tradition. One to which I question our
faithfulness.

Nobility results from the con-
vergence of ideals and self-dis-
cipline. Do we have either? The white
book states explicitly that “If you do
not believe in honorable conduct or
are indifferent on the point, W&L is
not the proper school for you.”

Kant held that human beings are
distinguishable from other life
because we can conceive and follow
moral principles. Honor is based on
that ability. But I don’t see how we
can call ourselves honorable or
moral and routinely participate in il-
legal activities. It’s inconsistent to
say one is honorable and serve
alcohol to minors. It’s  in-

quest signatures on a petition you
planned to present to the Board of
Trustees. The reaction to what you
called a “‘tremendous opportunity”
seems to have been lukewarm at
best. Again, you appear to be quite
alone in your thinking.

How can you believe that the Board
of Trustees would consider your peti-
tion at all? The Trustees encountered
great outcry from the alumni, yet
went ahead with their decision on
coeducation anyway. I can’t believe
that after having decided to dis-
regard their alumni (a principal
means of financial support);” that
they would reverse their ision
because of the opinions of a few
disgruntled students.

You mention the success of
Washington and Lee graduates and
then point proudly to the fact that
they came from an all-male institu-
tion. Mr. Robins, they also came
from an institution that had Saturday
classes, shorter vacations, tighter

consistent to say one is moral and
drink under age. It’s inconsistent to
say one is honorable and use recrea-
tional drugs. I realize that the moral
and legal do not always coincide. It is
my view that moral behavior,
honorable behavior, goes beyond
legal strictures. Such is implied by
the Founding Fathers’ opinion that
the Constitution could only govern a
moral people and no other kind. By
extension, I feel it is inconsistent to
call oneself a gentleman and manipu-
late or mistreat a young woman.
These same norms hold true for the
appellation of a ‘“‘lady.””

It is not my intention to lambaste
anyone. Rather, I hope that we will
ask ourselves if our actions reflect
gentlemanly ideals and be willing to
change if they do not. I fully realize
that I am not the best judge of anyone
but myself since I am not omniscient.
Nevertheless, I am opposed to the
narrow focus on students’ rights
without looking at the other side of
the seesaw — the side on which rest
student responsibilities. Rights can-
not exist without responsibilities.
Any tightening of restrictions stems
from a lack of confidence in the con-
trolled party’s execution of his or her
responsibilities. As a corollary,
restrictions are slackened when the
controlled party proves himself
capable of correct or wise decisions.
Instead of bemoaning the Hill’s in-
tervention in student activities, let’s
work to show ourselves responsible,
both as individuals and as a whole.

I also mentioned kind and
courageous as attributes of our
mythological beast — the ‘‘gentle-

‘give us a

fraternity regulations as well as
strict parietals. Do you want to turn
the clock back to those times as well?
Or just to the point you and your
friends want?

I came to Washington and Lee for
many reasons. I felt that the
academics were strong and would
enable me to receive an excellent
education. Also, I knew the school
was rich with tradition. Believe it or
not, Mr. Robins, I too enjoyed the
camaraderie of an all-male institu-
tion.. 1

Yet, our class, the class of 1988,
was the product of a declining appli-
cant pool. As a whole, the class’s
academic capabilities were weaker
than usual. Yes, Mr. Robins, Wash-
ington and Lee was rich with the
tradition you adore, but it was also on
its way toward becoming a second-
rate academic institution. Coeduca-
tion, like it or not, has fortunately
prevented that from coming to pass.

You often ascribe your manner of

man.”’ Coming from a Judeo-Chris
tian background, as did bot!
Washington and Lee, I don’t feel tha
the ideal person could be complet
without love as expressed in service
self-sacrifice and a sensitivity t
others’ needs and opinions. This 1:
the kind of love that will weed ou
prejudice and hauteur in an atmos
phere of intellectual striving lik«
W&L’s. In addition to kindness, we
must nurture courage. If indeed we
are honorable, then that is all we lack
to, as Ayn Rand put it, do what we
really want. Virtuous people have the
self-imposed obligation to remain
stalwart against opposition to their
heartfelt convictions. Let us befriend
that better self within each of us.

This is not an invitation to the open-
ing day of a witch hunt. More
accurately, it is a plea for the W&L
community to be true to ourselves
and to that tradition that sets
Washington and Lee apart as more
than a conferrer of diplomas. It
would be silly to disclaim personal
responsibility to the Honor System
and pretend a justifiable claim on
W&L’s reputation of producing wel)
educated gentlemen of sterling
character. It has been said that W&L
leaves an indelible mark on its
graduates. I believe that some of the
reasons can be found, even if im-
perfectly stated, in this letter. We
have much to look forward to — and
much to look back upon. Non incautus
futuri. Let us continue in our quest fo:
the elusive ideal of the W&l
gentleman (and lady), and not for-
sake the legacy and vision — the sou!
of this institution.

thinking as being reminiscent of
Robert E. Lee. Can you honestly
argue that President Lee would have
preferred for W&L to sacrifice
academics to preserve the Universi-
ty as an all-male institution? Presi-
dent Lee’s ideals extend beyond the
concept of single-sex institutions
Why can you not understand that?
Honor and everything else to which
you constantly refer, exist whether
Washington and Lee is all male or co-
ed. What gives men a monopoly on
honor? Do they have special genes”,
Perhaps something carried on the Y
chromosome?

Mr. Robins, your battle is over.
You have fought valiantly, but your
cause is lost. Accept it. The windmill
has knocked you from your horse.

Daly requests crowd support for lax game

Dear W&L students, faculty and staff:

On behalf of the 1987 Generals Lacrosse Team,
I want to thank you for your cooperation and sup-
port when we played UVA at Glen Maury and for
your continued support through all of our first
seven home games.

I am writing to ask as many of you as possible
to attend the Generals’ last regular season home
game versus Roanoke on Wednesday, April 29 at
3:00 p.m. on Wilson Field. Not only will this
game determine the 1987 ODAC Lacrosse Cham-
pion, it will determine the site of W&L’s first
round tournament game.

The NCAA determines sites for Division III
Lacrosse Tournament games based on the
criteria of

1) quality of facilities

2) revenue potential
W&L and Wilson field are definitely one of the
best facilities in Division III, so I have con-
fidence that criteria No. 1 is covered.
Translated, criteria No. 2 simply means crowd
attendance — the bigger the crowd on Wednes-
day, April 29, the better W&L’s chances for a
first round home game on May 6.

So, not only is W&L competing against
Roanoke on the field next Wednesday, W&L is
also competing against Hobart, Ohio Wesleyan,
St. Lawrence, RIT, Washington College, Cort-
land State, Roanoke, Hampden-Sydney, Frank-
lin and Marshall and others in the stands.

Please be in the stands Wednesday, April 29 at
3:00.

Thank you. Dennis Daly
Head Lacrosse Coach

‘Iron grip’ chokes student

To the Editors:

I am writing this letter to you out of despera-
tion. The leaders of all fraternities on campus
met last night for a special meeting to try and
organize a rush calendar suitable to the faculty
and administration as well as looking out for our
best interests and the interests of next year’s
freshmen. I personally wrote up a calendar I
thought would make both sides happy, but Dean
Atkins had a rebuttal for each point we made. I
feel I’m speaking for the student leaders of
Washington and Lee that if this University
claims that we have an effective student gover-
ment, why do they not only disapprove of our
suggestions, but do not try to compromise on dif-

 

ferent issues (especially fraternal).

Each and everyone present at that meeting
last night is very concerned about the future of
Washington and Lee and as long as the Iron grip
keeps choking us, I don’t know what to do. To the
group of about 35 present last night and those
present at the IFC meeting the night before, we
know we have made a serious effort to better this
University and I would wish the members of the
Student Affairs Committee would see our con-
cern when they meet on the Rush Calendar.

Webb called ‘true gentleman’

To the Editors:

I would like to commend Michael Webb for his
letter in last week’s Phi. He deserves praise for
defending Valerie Pierson. Perhaps Rick Robins
could learn a thing or two from this true W&L
gentleman. Yes, Mr. Robins, those gentlemen
are still here in full force — you are the one in the
minority.

Rachel R. Jackson ’90

Senior responds to Robins

To the Editors:

In response to Mr. Robins’ letter last week, I
must admit that I, too, “get both furious and
sad’’ — furious that members of the so-called il-
lustrious ‘‘last class with balls” bother to revive
the issue of an all-male W&L and sad that they
fail to do so in not only an unconvincing but also
barely coherent manner.

 

The non sequitur which Mr. Robins proposes
absurdly implies that since previous W&L
graduates have been successful (pointing to the
Standard and Poor poll) and since those
graduates come from an all-male institution,
future graduates will not be as successful
because they attended school with women. One
doesn’t have to be a logician to discern that the
above rationale is ludicrous. Take a step back,
Mr. Robins. Objectively view W&L as it is, not
the way you wish to see it.

Secondly, Mr. Robins unfairly attacks Presi-
dent Wilson, describing him as ‘‘visionary.’’ I do
not think, however, that it is impractical to
bolster or even improve on a good thing. Does
Mr. Robins want stagnation and eventually
mediocrity? Furthermore, Mr. Robins describes
the Board’s decision for coeducation as “the
easy way out, instead of undertaking more ag-
gressive recruiting efforts.”’ Yet, later in his let-
ter, Robins’ argument wavers, saying, ‘‘If poten-
tial W&L gents are residing in the West or even
the North, they will find us.’’ Well, what do you
want, Mr. Robins — for the Board to recruit or to
apathetically sit back? Your elitist and arrogant
attitude hardly follows the ‘gentlemanly con-
duct”’ which you present as the underlying prin-
ciple of the W&L MAN.

Thirdly, Mr. Robins equates “uniqueness’’
with monotony and homogeneity. Judging from
his remarks, he'd like everyone here to reside
south of the Mason-Dixon line and east of the
Mississippi. Boy, wouldn’t that be a “unique”
school? Why can’t being the best small universi-
ty in the South be a satisfactory qualification for
“‘uniqueness’’?

Finally, having been here for two years of both
all-male and coed W&L, I admit there are a
number of things I miss. After all, I was one of
many who adamantly opposed coeducation two
and a half years ago. Still, coeducation has been
a huge plus for the campus. If having increasing-
ly competitive SAT scores, a diverse student
body, and competition, both socially and
academically, with women scares Mr. Robins
and his disciples, then I suggest a quaint school
not too far from here in Farmville for them to
spend the remainder of their college careers.

Perhaps Mr. Robins cannot be faulted, though.
For, within only 20 months those fiendish W&L
women have seduced and corrupted his once lof-
ty ideals and sound reasoning powers. Then
again, I doubt they’ve even tried to seduce him.

OPINION/NEWS

 

It was the second day of Spring
Term, and | felt about as exciting and
creative as a student election poster.

So once again, I found myself swig-
ging dark, foamy ones at the old milk
bar, when a voice asked me what was
wrong. I looked up to discover that
after a year and a half, Captain
Honor Code had returned.

“Well,” I said, “I’ve recently
heard students talk about past years’
honor trials, and these armchair
jurors have no clue about what
they’re saying.”

“But won’t discussion of honor
cases strengthen their understanding
of the honor system?” asked Captain
Honor Code.

“Not if they are distributing false
rumors. A lot of people still are talk-
ing about the case in which I served
as a juror last year. Some students
speculated that the accused was ‘let
off’ because there was a dispropor-
tionate number of freshmen on the
jury. That simply is not true.

“All the jurors were picked by the
computer according to the rules set
forth in the White Book. The fresh-
man jurors acted maturely and
responsibly during the deliberations.
Voting was by secret ballot, as was
required, but I know the freshmen
cast theirs thoughtfully. By not
allowing freshmen on the jury, we
would allow for expulsion without
representulsion, or something like
that.”

“So why was the guy acquitted if he
admitted to stealing a tub of wine
while intoxicated?”’

“T don’t know. I cannot speak for
all jurors, only myself.”’

“Ts that the only reason you’re
upset?’’ asked the Captain.

“No,”’ I said. “Being a juror gives
you a whole new perspective on the
honor code. As the Law News pointed
out in an editorial, there seem to be
no standards regarding admissibility

of evidence. We were allowed to sub-
mit handwritten questions after each
witness testified, but the presiding of-
ficer often decided that they were not
relevant or that they had been asked
already. I thought most of them were
important, relevant questions.

“Also, the White Book does not
allow the jury to bring a written copy
of the judge’s charge into the
deliberations room. I don’t under-
stand why.”

“So is that why he was let off?”
Captain Honor Code asked.

“Well, I don’t think that ‘let off’ is
really the appropriate phrase in this
case. In the honor trial we’ve been
discussing, the accused followed all
the proper procedures and was ac-
quitted.

“But why?” Captain Honor Code
asked again. “‘Isn’t it contradictory
to call someone honorable after he
confesses to stealing?”’

“Not to everyone, obviously. To
quote Billy Joel, I think it was just a
matter of trust. The White Book says
the honor code is based on trust. And
although the accused admitted to
stealing, not one witness said he
distrusted him. Not the cop who stop-
ped him. Not the people at Spanky’s
restaurant, which continued to ac-
cept his business.”’

“You do realize that there could be
some questions about your telling me
this, considering Section O’s provi-
sions for confidentiality,” Captain
Honor Code said.

“Yes, I know. But why let the ig-
norant pass rumors when I can tell
some truth? Why not give people the
chance to have informed discussions
about the honor code and the opinions
of the current student generation?

“T almost ended up on jury duty
again this week. It seems like an ap-
propriate time to remind people
about what constitutes an informed
opinion.”

 

 

Cancer run planned

From Staff Reports

 

Athough last week’s torrential
rains have forced some changes in
the 10-kilometer course, the plans for
tbe Rockbridge Cancer Run ’87, “‘A
Run With George Cunningham,”
have been finalized.

The 5- and 10-kilometer races and
the one-mile fun run/walk will begin
at 1:30 p.m., Sunday on Wilson Field.
The event will be held rain or shine.
All proceeds from the Cancer Run
vill othe American Cancer Socie-

Organizers of the run have chang-
ed the 10K route from the course
originally announced because high
waters on the Maury River have forc-
ed the closing of the Chessie Trail
Bridge at VMI Island.

The 5K and 10K races will begin at
1:45 p.m. in front of the law school
adjacent to Wilson Field. Both
groups will follow the first portion of
the cross country course behind the
student pavilion and the houses on
Anderson Drive. The runners will
take the lower trail along the VMI
tennis courts to the small green
house on the left.

At that point, the 5K runners will
turn left and go back along the upper
trail and the Woods Creek Trail to the
finish line. The 10K runners will turn
right, go to Main Street, and take a
left at the Stop-In. The runners will
then proceed across the traffic
bridge on the left side and take a left
at the light at East Lexington. The
runners will run about a half a mile
out, turn around and retrace their
steps across the bridge and up Main
Street.

The runners will continue on Main
into town and take a right on Letcher
Avenue, and stay on Letcher until
Moody Hall on the VMI post. They

will take a left at Moody and then
another left at the Marshall Museum.
The runners will then follow the road
down the hill and up Anderson Drive
to rejoin the trail for the finish.

The fun run/walk will begin at 1:30
p.m. at the W&L law school. The
course is a half mile down the Woods
Creek Trail and back. The course is
designed for runners and walkers of
all ages, including grandparents and
babies in strollers.

Registration for the races will
begin at noon on the grounds of the
law school. The fee for the 5K and
10K races is $5. There is no charge for
the fun run/walk. Runners can also
register on race day; the cost for
registering then is $6. All entry fees
are tax-deductible.

Wendy’s Old Fashioned Ham-
burgers and University Florist are
co-sponsoring this year’s event. Each
has donated $200 to help defray the
cost of the T-shirts. Each runner who
raises $10 or more in pledges will
receive a shirt.

Wendy’s is also providing refresh-
ments, volunteers and age-group
prizes. Jefferson Cups engraved by
Hamric & Sheridan Jewelers will go
to the winners of the race and to the
person who raises the most money.
Sweet Things of Lexington will pro-
vide ice cream for all fun run-
ners/walkers under the age of 12.

The Cancer Run honors George
Cunningham who, despite his battle
with cancer, has become one of the
area’s most prolific runners.

Entry forms and more information
about the run can be obtained by con-
tacting Patti Ryan-Mandel, race
coordinator, at 628 Stonewall St.,
Lexington, Va. 24450, (703) 463-8460.
Forms are also available at Wendy’s
in Lexington and the University
Florist in Lexington.

Possible problems seen

By STACY MORRISON
Staff Reporter

 

If sororities come to Washington
and Lee University, they will have no
extraordinary zoning problems when
they find a house in Lexington, said
Lexington City Manager Joe King.

“It all depends on the zoning
district where the house is,” he said.
If a sorority wants to obtain a house
in what is considered a “general
residential area” it must first obtain
a special permit from the city. All
fraternities, sororities, boarding
hemes, tourist homes and retirement
homes must obtain such permits,
said King. This permit is a “condi-
tional use permit.”

“The Building and Zoning Ad-
ministration has a wide discretion in
banning and granting this permit.
The decision is based on the number
of people living in the dwelling, park-

ing, location and traffic,’ said King.

Types of dwellings that do not need
a conditional use permit in residen-
tial areas are single-family homes,
two-family homes (duplexes),
schools, churches, parks and
playgrounds. King added that most
property in Lexington is zoned as
general residential area. If, however,
a sorority finds a suitable dwelling in
the central commercial and business
district of Lexington, it will be allow-
ed to house there without any special
permits.

The biggest problem for incoming
sororities, said King, will be finding a
house or dwelling that could be con-
sidered desirable for sorority life.
‘‘All the big houses that are like most
of the fraternity houses are not on the
market,”’ he said. “I can’t think of
anything large enough that would be
going up for sale.”’

Admissions: more than just grades

By JACK CHAMBERLAIN
From The Roanoke Times & World-
News

At 10:20 a.m. on Jan. 19, William
Hartog, director of admissions at
Washington and Lee University,
reads the first name from a stack of
applications that Julia Kozak and
Chris Lion had lugged into his office
on the second floor of Washington
Hall.

They vote to hold the file for
midyear senior grades.

Kozak, associate director of admis-
sions, and Lion, in his first year as an
admissions counselor, toss their
voting slips onto the file. Hartog
drops the file to the floor next to his
right foot.

It took two seconds.

Dan Murphy, associate admissions
director, and Mimi Milner Elrod,
assistant director, would review
their files with Hartog in the after-
noon. Most of the best and worst have
already been decided, so most of
these will be tough calls, mostly re-

ts.

Hartog reads another name. No,
she’s out.

“Hey, we made our first decision,”
Kozak quips.

Another no, a hold, a no. A girl gets
three no votes, another gets three
yeses,

“Yay! We’ve admitted one!”’ says

Smokeout coming to campus

By TOM BRICKEL
Staff Reporter

For those members of the W&L
community who’ve seen their
dreams of quitting tobacco products
go “up in smoke,” an upcoming
event will afford smokers and users
of smokeless tobacco products a
chance to kick the habit.

Sponsored by the university’s
Alcohol and Health Awareness Com-
mittee, the campus’ first ‘‘Smoke-
out”’ ever will be held on Monday.

The committee will set up a display
table in front of the Washington and
Lee snack bar. Among the materials
to be offered are a video display on
smokeless tobacco, free wrist snap-
pers for those who smoke, ‘‘adopt a
smoker’”’ stickers, and copies of ‘‘The
7 Day Quitters Guide’ and ‘‘Fifty

Kozak. Another girl gets unanimous
approval.

“How about that?” says Hartog.
“Two ina row.”

They are tough on the young
women, who face keener competition
among their peers than the male ap-
plicants do among the men. A girl
gets two no votes and a hold, and
she’s out.

‘‘Were she a he,”’ Hartog sighs.

One girl’s record looked great. She
was an honor student. But she had no
high school foreign language courses
that W&L requires. Hartog’s head
sagged to his desk top in dismay.

“We don’t want to penalize kids
because of their school,’’ he says.
“Are we her first choice?”

Yes, he’s told. He drops her file on
the hold pile. She could meet the re-
quirements by taking a language at
W&L, if she’s accepted.

A girl gets three yes votes, another
three no votes.

Hartog asks about a minority ap-
plicant. W&L has few black students
and he wants more. Elrod says the
applicant is black, but ‘I don’t think
he’s going to come, though.”

“She is Jewish,” Hartog says as he
scans another file. ‘Boy, would I love
to get some Jewish kids.’’ W&L’s ap-
plication doesn’t ask about religion,
but the girl had mentioned B'nai
B’rith in her essay. W&L has fewer

Most Often Asked Questions About
Smoking and Health and the
Answers.”’ Posters will be on display
throughout the campus.

According to Carol Calkins, a
member of the Alcohol and Health
Awareness Committee, the event is
part of the committee’s effort to
branch out into health-related issues
other than alcohol.

“‘Given the number of people who
smoke on campus, we felt that by
helping raise the awareness of the ef-
fects of smoking on overall health,
we would be providing an essential
service to the W&L community,”
said Calkins.

“Many former smokers report not
being able to give up the habit on the
first attempt, but trying three or four
times before finally succeeding,”
said Calkins. ‘‘We intend to support

Jews than blacks.

A girl has a B-plus average, but
she’s near the bottom of her high
school class. No, no, no. ‘Talk about
grade inflation!” Hartog says.

“Geography plus diversity,” he
says of another applicant from a
small town W&L never hears from.
He and the others also like her varied
activities. She’s accepted, but Kozak
is concerned that only 35 percent of
her high school goes to college.

Hartog votes to hold another file,
but Kozak and Lion say no. Hartog
yields. The girl is rejected. He said
he has to rely on his associates or the
system won’t work, so he seldom
overrules them.

A young woman receives the high-
est academic ratings from the team,
rare indeed.

“Only thing bad on her record is a
D in math,” Hartog says. It was one
of the few times a D was overlooked.

“‘Too many hooks and one dog,” he
says of a young man. ‘“‘Lots of hooks.
Lot of time leading, not enough time
studying,’’ he says of another.

Hooks and dogs are admissions
talk for C’s and D’s.

“This guy’s taking a siesta in his
senior year,’’ he says of another as he
glances through a transcript of easy
courses. ‘‘So long, he’s gone.”’

“This is a kid who destroyed a frat
house,’’ Hartog says as the file is re-

haven’t tried to quit smoking to do so.
It’s a highly addictive habit, but peo-

The Smokeout will not be limited to
cigarette smokers, Calkins said.
‘Many young people are resorting to
smokeless tobacco — snuff and chew-
ing tobacco — as alternatives to
cigarettes. Nationwide, it is nearly a
$1 billion a year industry.

“Unfortunately, these products are
not safe either. For these tobacco
users, the Smokeout offers an effec-
tive five-minute video, as well as in-
formation for those hooked on
cigarettes.”

around here who are smart.”

A science scholar gets three en-
thusiastic yes votes. ‘‘We need some
science students, that’s for sure,”
Hartog says.

“Class underachiever,”’ Kozak
says of a boy with 1,290 on his SATs
but low grades. He is rejected.

Hartog grins as he pulls a file
across his desk that is thicker than
the others, a sure sign that the
academic record is thin. Hartog says
they usually are stuffed with glowing
letters from friends of the father who
probably don’t know the kid.

“The thicker the file, the thicker
the applicant,’’ he says.

Another young man has nearly
1,300 on his SATs and good achieve-
ment scores, but also lots of C’s, D’s
and F’s on his transcript.

“‘He’s history,’ Hartog says, drop-
ping the file next to his chair with a
plop.

“T like this kid. He’s an under-
achiever who has a reason,” he says
of another. His grades dropped when

New freshman dean looks ahead to job

By MARIE DUNNE
Editorial Page Editor

Kenneth P. Ruscio, a Washington
and Lee alumnus who will replace H.
Robert Huntley as assistant dean of
students next year, says he has no
specific plans at this time to change
freshman orientation or programs
throughout the year. But he does
have several ideas he’d like the
university to examine.

Ruscio, a 1976 W&L cum laude
graduate who served as assistant
dean of students and assistant direc-
tor of admissions from 1976 to 1978,
added he’d like to become re-
acquainted with the college before
starting any new programs.

“My feeling is the changes that
have occurred are beneficial. I need
to get re-acquainted with (the univer-
sity). I need to find out what has gone
on here. There are some things that
haven’t changed, and I’m awfully
happy about that,”’ said Ruscio.

“T don’t have any specific plans. I
think it would be presumptuous of me
to try to come in and say, ‘Here’s
what we’re going to do,’ ’’ he said.

Ruscio was on campus to meet with
the deans and various members of
the faculty and student body and to
search for a home in the Lexington
area.

Ruscio will be responsible for
freshman and upperclass resident
life in the new Gaines residence hall.

Among some of the ideas Ruscio
has is ‘residential theme sections’
in the upperclass residence facility.

Residential theme sections, al-
ready implemented at many col-
leges, are sections ‘of the residence
hall where students with common in-
terests can live together and plan
functions around that common in-
terest, with possible involvement by
interested faculty, said Ruscio.

Another idea Ruscio wants to ex-
amine is ‘faculty forums”’ within the
residence halls to get faculty more
involved in the residential side of the
college.

“Those are some of the things that
other colleges are doing, and it’s
worth exploring whether it could be
done here. I think there’s some need
for something like that,”’ said Ruscio.

Ruscio said his highest priority will

W&L receives grant

 

rom Staff Reports

Washington and Lee has received a
$100,000 challenge grant from the Ar-
thur Vining Davis Foundations of
Jacksonville, Fla., to fund a new Pro-
gram for Leaders in Law and Com-
merce.

The program is designed to bring
business lawyers and _ business
leaders to the law school and the
School of Commerce, Economics,
and Politics as guest lecturers on the
real-world problems they face.

“We can better focus on business
activity and dispute avoidance by
bringing in business lawyers and
business leaders for a few days at a
time during the academic year,”
said Rick Kirgis, dean of the School
of Law, in announcing the grant. ‘“‘We
will ask the visiting lawyers and
business leaders to share with us
their experience and insights, in-
cluding their problems. In_ those
discussions, we will expect the
lawyers and business leaders to ad-
dress ethical issues as well as purely
legal or business issues.”

The new program will be ad-
ministered by Lyman P.Q. Johnson,
assistant professor of law, whose
teaching and research fall in the area
of business law, and Lawrence W.
Lamont, professor of administration,
whose specialty is marketing and
marketing strategy. Lamont also has
extensive experience working with

the legal profession and is widely us-
ed as an expert witness.

Under the new program, lawyers
and business leaders will serve as
guest lecturers in law and business
administration courses. They will
meet informally with both students
and faculty and — on some occasions
— give public lectures.

The visiting lawyers and business
leaders may also participate in
W&L’s existing program on Society
and the Professions: Studies in Ap-
plied Ethics. The Society and the
Professions program, begun in 1971,
includes undergraduate courses in
legal ethics and business ethics in ad-
dition to studies in journalism and
pre-medicine.

“Through the Program for
Leaders in Law and Commerce our
students will gain an appreciation of
how experienced business people and
lawyers seek to prevent problems,”’
Kirgis said. ‘‘That is a skill too often
slighted in the traditional focus on
solving problems once they have
arisen.”

The Arthur Vining Davis Founda-
tion provides grants to certain educa-
tional, cultural, scientific, and
religious institutions. Its founder, the
late Arthur Vining Davis, served for

be to train and work with dorm
counselors and resident advisors.
Ruscio met with this year’s dorm
counselors Friday afternoon.

“If I can’t work with dorm
counselors and R.A.s, I can’t do
anything else in my job, so that has to
be my highest functional priority,”
said Ruscio.

Regarding the changes that have
occurred since Ruscio was a student,
Ruscio said he was ‘‘strongly in favor
of coeducation’’ as a student and sup-
ported the move as an alumnus.

“For me, there was never a reason
not to be coeducational, and I’ve
welcomed the change wholehearted-
ly,” said Ruscio.

Ruscio, a member of Pi Kappa Phi
during his freshman and sophomore
years and Sigma Chi during his
junior and senior years, said that
fraternities serve a positive role on
campus, but that he’d like to see
some alternatives to fraternities.

about that. I don’t think anyone here

Ruscio hopes the upperclass resi-

tive to fraternities.

Ruscio is currently an assistant
professor in the department of social
science and policy studies at
Worcester Polytechnical Institute.
He holds an M.P.A. and Ph.D. from
Syracuse University.

Ruscio, who has traveled across
the country and taught and visited at
many colleges, said that in com-
parison to other schools, ‘‘Washing-
ton and Lee is still one of the finest
colleges in the country in my mind.”

“T think (seeing so many other col-
leges) has told me that Washington
and Lee can be better. There are
some things out there that other col-
leges and universities are doing that
would be nice to see if they would
work here,” said Ruscio. ‘‘I think the
mark of a good college is that it is
always trying to be better.”’

The Constitutional Convention will
debate five possible Constitutional
amendments. They include the ERA,
balanced budget, right-to-life, line
item veto and states’ rights.

Some state delegations still have
openings, and interested students
should contact the appropriate state
chairmen. Lists of chairmen are
posted in the library, the university
center and the Co-op.

Math majors rank high

From Staff Reports

 

A team of Washington and Lee
University mathematics majors has
ranked in the top one-fifth in a recent
nation-wide mathematics competi-
tion sponsored by the Mathematical
Association of America. The 47th an-
nual Putnam Competition drew 2,094
contestants from 358 colleges and
universities in the United States and
Canada. 270 institutions entered
teams and W&L’s team ranked 5ist
in that group.

Contestants tackle six problems in
each of two 3-hour sessions and their
solutions are sent to the Competition
headquarters for grading. W&L’s
top-scoring contestant was John D.
Boller, a sophomore from New
Jersey, who ranked 127th among the
2,094 enterants, placing him in the
top 6 percent nationwide. The other
two team members were Michael P
Aarstol and Mierwhaan Manan, and

‘Just dumb luck,’’ Hartog said
with a laugh.

If fewer than 290 men and 130
women confirm with the $250
deposits by May 1 and show up in
September, Hartog will go to the
‘wait list.’’ Because students are ap-
plying to several schools, Hartog ex-
pects his yield to be about 45 percent.
He thinks he'll have to dip into his
wait list for 30 or 40 more freshmen
—even as late as August and early
September.

Hartog’s uncertainty — shared by
other admissions directors — is that
other schools have wait lists, too. The
dominoes are set in motion as appli-
cants on other wait lists get friendly
calls from favored schools during the
summer.

W&L applicants seem to have no
qualms about kissing $250 goodbye if
a school they prefer gives the nod
late in the game, Hartog said.

Continued from Page 1

 

College admissions is a year-round
process, but it culminates in March
at W&L and other schools across the
country with a crush of decisions and
letters of congratulations or regret to
high school seniors.

Many selective schools have
reported increasing numbers of ap-
plications this year, despite a conti-
nuing decline in the number of high
school seniors. W&L, for instance,
had a record 3,335 applicants for a
freshman class of only 420.

One reason for the increase: high
school seniors are applying to more
colleges. The average for W&L ap-
plicants was seven or eight, Hartog
said, One young man applied to 18.

‘I’m nervous about that,’’ Hartog
said. ‘I'm very nervous about that.’’

The admissions process started
last September.

Hartog said he found 45 applica-
tions waiting for him when he return-
ed to work after Labor Day last fall.
The flood didn’t stop until after the

1,265 from women, compared to only
975 applications nine years ago.

“And you’re wondering why we
have smirks on our faces,’’ Hartog
said, a smirk on his face. He was in
admissions director’s heaven. He
could be more selective than ever
this year. He was proud of his school,
even a little smug.

“Today's applicant pool at W&L is
stronger than the enrolling class in
1984,” the last year the school was all
male, Hartog said. Most of this
year’s applicants, particularly the
women, could have made it into
almost any college or university, he
said.

On a chilly January afternoon,
stacks of files from 54 women
covered his desk on the second floor
of Washington Hall.

night. I accepted 13. I rejected 19.

What Hartog was nervous about
was the ‘‘yield’’ on the acceptance
letters. How many of those high
school seniors W&L accepted for its
freshman class would actually show
up this fall instead of heading for
UVa, William and Mary, or a Har-
vard, a Princeton or a Duke?

‘You have to have a little bit of the
riverboat gambler in you to play this
game. We really don’t want to offer
admission to one more than we have
to,” Hartog had said several weeks
earlier. W&L has room for 290 men
and 130 women this fail.

‘Basically, what the president
wants is 420 kids,’ he said. ‘‘He
doesn’t want 421, he doesn’t want
419.”

tor for eight years, has done what

“Only another 3,000 decisions to
go,” Hartog says. ‘‘We’re rolling.”

Hartog, Murphy, Kozak, Elrod and
Lion lug their files up one floor to
Room W-32 and stack them on a con-
ference table 8 feet square. There are
19 stacks, each about a foot high.

Hartog announces that they have
made 1,379 decisions so far. They
have accepted 416 men and 180
women. They have rejected 414 men
and 369 women. Only 1,500 or 1,900 to
go, he says.

The task on March 9 was to review
the applications from 215 high
schools that had from four to 26
students apply. The idea is to be con-
sistent.

“It would be wise to keep track of
all this because when the phone
starts ringing in April you may have
to speak about them,”’ Hartog says.
They visit the schools and know most
of the counselors and principals.

“IT think we should reject them
all,’ Murphy says of a New England
prep school where eight have applied
and one has already been accepted.
“So you would have us change our
decision?’’ Hartog asks. ‘‘It’s a little
rash to go from accept to reject.”

Hartog says the school is top notch,
and the boy won’t face tougher com-
petition at W&L. The original deci-
sion stands.

“Tm tired of mediocrity from that
school,’ he says of another North-
eastern prep school. Reject all four.
Hartog describes a private school
near Atlanta as a ‘‘white flight
school’ of questionable quality. They
accept one of six applicants.

“IT think we can reject her,’’ Kozak
says of a girl from Texas. “I don’t
think we should do that,’’ Hartog
says. They hold her file.

Hartog says the basketball coach is
interested in one young man, but he
can’t go along. Scores are all right,
but his grades are poor. ‘We'll let

Three days later, Hartog says a
boy from Connecticut looks good, ex-
cept the alumnus who interviewed
him was appalled that the boy show-
ed up in Topsiders without socks
when it was 20 degrees with a food of
snow outside.

A black applicant from New
England is accepted despite SATs
under 1,000.

‘‘How are we coming on minorities
this year?”’ Lion asks. ‘‘Slow,’’ Har-
tog says. Elrod checks a computer
printout and reports they have ac-
cepted a dozen so far.

A hot football and basketball pro-
spect with top scores, grades and
class rank has applied to the entire
Ivy League and W&L is not at the top
of his list, but Hartog accepts him.

“He did everything we asked him
to do,”’ Hartog says. ‘‘I have no pro-
blem with anyone who wants to go to
Harvard.”

Hartog is torn between accepting a
girl near the top of her class with
SATs of barely 1,100 or a classmate
lower in rank with scores of nearly
1,400.

“Oh, I hate this,’”’ he says. ‘‘Why
don’t we have about 40 more slots for
women?”

He decides on the girl with the
higher class rank and lower scores.

On March 16, Hartog tells his staff
they have accepted 693 applicants so
far with average SATs of 610 verbal
and 653 math who rank in the top fifth
of their high school classes. Just 182

performed at the highest levels,”
Hartog said. The competition dic-
tates who gets accepted. Competition
seeks its own level. ‘All we're going
to do is select the best 900 from that
pool. I have no agenda.”’

Hartog and his four assistants had
spent the last three months poring
over stacks of files from 3,335 ap-
plicants at the rate of about 400 a
week, evaluating and marking their
ballots for their next meeting. They
met twice a week for two months,
hacking away at the dwindling stacks
until there were none.

“This is the easy part of the year.
This is the time we make the obvious
decisions,”’ Hartog said as he conven-
ed the first admissions meeting in his
office on Jan. 19.

‘When in doubt, hold,”’ he tells his
associates, Julia Kozak, associate
director of admissions, and Chris
Lion, a rookie admissions counselor
who graduated from W&L last year.

Dan Murphy, associate director
who has been in admissions for nine
years, and Mimi Milner Elrod, assis-
tant director in her first year, would
bring their stacks of folders to Har-
tog’s office that afternoon.

“Don't feel you have to make a
decision, particularly at this time of
the year,” Hartog told them. “We
don’t need to get into a great debate
in January and February. We don’t
need to get emotional.”’

‘‘Who gets emotional?’’ Kozak said
witha laugh.

SOSCCSOCPPOSCOSOHSOGOSSS®

Most of the time Hartog and his
assistants had taken the files home to
read .at night and on weekends
because they spend most of their
days telephoning high schools for
more information, fielding calls from
anxious parents or counselors and in-
terviewing applicants.

Hartog recalled a weekend a few
years ago when he needed some files
a colleague had at home. They ar-
ranged to meet halfway in a deserted
restaurant parking lot near In-
terstate 81. It was dark. They flashed
their headlights in recognition. They
exchanged files through car win-
dows. They sped away.

When they saw each other on Mon-
day morning, they burst into
laughter. What if someone had seen
them? It had been like a drug-buy
scene from ‘‘Miami Vice.”

SPOS HHO SSP ESHPOSSOSS

Hartog, who has been in college ad-
missions 17 years and at W&L for
nine, survived a storm of alumni pro-
test when he supported going coed
three years ago to bolster the sagging
quantity and quality of applications.
W&L, a traditional, conservative,
Southern school whose history in-
cludes’ George Washington and
Robert E. Lee, had been all-male

would reject 67.

Special letters would go to the
fathers of students who weren’t ac-
cepted before the students would get
their letters. It was a courtesy, and
better than explaining on the tele-
phone.

‘The problem with the telephone is
they’ll be emotional,”’ he said. ‘‘A let-
ter gives them time to really think
about what our situation is here.”’

A list of legacies of interest to the
president, director of development
and director of alumni relations
totals 42. Sixteen had been accepted
earlier as “clearly admissible,” so
Hartog and his staff had to carefully
reconsider 26.

They accept five, reject 13 and put
five on the wait list.

A young man gets four yes votes,
but Hartog votes no because his
record is peppered with C’s. ‘‘He will
not get the work done, but we’ll take
him,” he says. “‘As far as I’m con-
cerned, he doesn’t deserve to be
here.”

“Let’s turn him down,” Murphy
says. ‘‘No. My question is not
whether he can do the work, but
whether he will get the work done,”’
Hartog says.

Two young men whose SATs are
under 1,000 are rejected because they
can’t do the work.

“It’s all subjecture,”’ Hartog says.
‘Who the hell knows what it takes to
do the work here?”’

Someone says a female with an
average record really wants to go to
another school. ‘‘They won’t take her
so I guess that means we’ll get stuck
with her,’ Hartog says. She’s ac-
cepted.

“No, if we can get away with it,”
Kozak says of a trustee’s child who
barely cracked 400 on the SAT ver-
bals.

“Let’s try to get away with it,”
Hartog says.

The father of a boy who ranks near
the middle of his class went to W&L
only a year, but Kozak says he should
be treated as a legacy to be fair. They
decide to put him on the wait list.

“The only thing that allows us to
sleep at night is consistency — or a
very good reason for being inconsis-
tent,”’ Hartog says.

But this was the year of Hartog’s
vindication, the year numbers and
the quality of the applicants broke
records, the most since 2,639 two
years ago when W&L accepted its
first female undergraduates.

Women had applied, of course, but
so did more men than ever.

The last year W&L was all-male,
the school received about 1,500 ap-
plications and accepted 900 or 60 per-
cent of them. This year, W&L receiv-
ed more than 2,000 applications from
men and nearly 1,300 from women for
about the same size class.

Since going coed, W&L has cut its
acceptance rate in half. Hartog
believes W&L has become as selec-
tive as UVa, which started accepting
women undergraduates 20 years ago.
This year, 230 or 19 percent of W&L’s
1,200 undergradutes are women. The
goal in three years is to have 1,000
men and 500 women.

The administration and Board of
Trustees are easing into coeducation,
so Hartog had orders to hold the new
freshman class to 30 percent female.
As a result, a higher percentage of
women applicants were judged as a
group for fewer spots than the
women. This means that a woman
has to be smarter than a man to get
in.

“If we were sex blind, we’d pro-
bably be 50-50 right now,” Hartog
said.

PSFOSSOSSOSSSSOSCOCOSSOSD

Some colleges and universities use
what is called ‘‘rolling admissions’”’
where each decision is made as the
applications come in. At W&L, most
decisions were made after the
deadline so the admissions staff
could rate each file against the com-
petition and take the best.

Trustee policy also requires
special consideration for the sons and
daughters of alumni, who are called
legacies. Their status was clearly
noted on their files, which were held
for special review if they did not sur-
vive the competition of other ap-
plicants.

If their scores and grades show
they can and will do the work, they’re
in,
Hartog glanced at the file of an
alumnus’ daughter and stacked it
with the others for the legacy
meeting.

““She’s not going to make it,”’ he
said, wringing his hands in despair.
“T’ll get about 19 telephone calls.’’ He
looked at another. ‘‘Oh, no,’’ he
groaned.

This year, 192 sons and daughters
of alumni applied, and 61 were ac-
cepted on their own merits. That left
113 for special consideration. Of
those, 28 were accepted, and 23 were
put on the wait list — some of them
quite reluctantly.

Hartog and his staff also favor
residents of Lexington and Rock-
bridge County, racial minorities,
religious minorities and candidates
who live in places that will give W&L
— known as a preppy place for rich,

white, Protestant kids driving
BMW’s — more diversity.
Legacies, racial minorities and

residents of Lexington and
Rockbridge County have twice the
chance of getting in as other ap-

plicants with similar academic
records, Hartog said.
“Make note. I didn’t include

athletes,” he quickly added.

He had special lists of athletes
from the coaches, but the applicant
had to meet minimum guidelines
—such as at least 500 on each
Scholastic Aptitude Test section,
course requirements and class rank
— to even be considered.

Hartog said he imposed the
academic parameters to keep the
coaches from wasting their time pur-
suing mental midgets. Hartog
discussed athletes who met the
minimums with coaches individual-
ly.

POP SSM SCHEPOCMESSED

W&L has not cut off scores for the
SATs, The College Board’s standar-
dized tests for verbal and math abili-
ty, Hartog said. But the prevailing
scores tend to rise with the quality of
the applicant pool. Possible scores
are 200 to 800 in each category.

But he and his associates often
looked askance at scores much below
600 if the file didn’t have redeeming
academic and social value — like
high achievement scores and lots of
A’s in tough courses at a good school,
or signs of leadership or special
talent.

High scores on the SATs — say
1,300 to 1,400 or more — with C’s and
D’s in the high school record were
sure signs that a kid may be smart,
but lazy. W&L didn’t want them this
year.

W&L rejected 47 percent of the ap-
plicants with verbal SAT scores
higher than 600 and 57 percent with
math scores over 600 because of
mediocre high school records, usual-
ly average or poor grades or a weak
academic program.

At least two rejects had scores of
700 verbal and 710 math, 1,410 com-
bined.

Modest combined SAT scores in the
1,000 to 1,200 range, backed with lots
of A’s and maybe a B or two in tough
courses, showed a kid was a hard
worker. W&L took lots of them.

The average SAT scores of those
accepted this year were 603 verbal
and 646 math, seven and four points

more than last year. But they also
averaged in the 87th percentile — the
top fifth — of their senior classes.

“The public, by and large, thinks
all we look at are scores, grade point
averages and class rank. In reality,
nothing is taken at face value,”’ Har-
tog said. Good grades and class rank
mean nothing if the courses are fluff
and the school has a reputation for
giving away A’s and B’s. ‘We will
turn away people who rank in the top
10 percent of their class if we feel the
program was weak.”

On the last day of their decisions,
March 25, Hartog and his staff declin-
ed to accept two girls from different
high schools who were valedictorians
of their classes. Top grades and top
class rank meant nothing if the
schools, the academic programs and
the SAT and achievement scores
were weak compared with the rest of
the female applicants.

That was tough. They didn’t want
to take them, but they didn’t want to
discourage their schools from en-
couraging more applicants next

year. They reluctantly put them on ,

the wait list to avoid offending the
schools.

A’s in a strong program at a good
high school are the first things Har-
tog and the others look for on an ap-
plication. SAT and achievement
scores in English and two subjects
chosen by the student are important,
but the W&L admissions staff are
more impressed by high class rank in
a good school and A’s and B’s ina
strong academic program that in-
cluded college Advanced Placement
courses, honors classes, English,
laboratory sciences and _ several
years of a foreign language.

“We're looking at the academic
record,”’ Hartog said. Eighty percent
of the decisions are based on high
school transcripts, not SAT scores
alone, he said.

When in doubt, they also consider
the recommendations from high
school counselors and teachers, per-

sonal interviews at W&L or by one of ,

450 alumni representatives in 75
cities, and the applicant’s own essay.

“‘We’re not looking for the great ‘

American novel, that’s for sure,”
Hartog said. They are looking for
good writing with some thinking
behind it, not just an account of a
summer vacation.

Interviews are not required, but
highly recommended. If an accept-
able applicant hasn’t been interview-
ed on campus or in his home state by
March, the admissions staff assumes
W&L isn’t his first choice. Most like-
ly, Hartog said, that file is sidetrack-
ed in favor of ‘‘someone of com-
parable quality who really wants to
be here.”’

W&L professor
emeritus dies

 

From Staff Reports

 

James Holt Starling, professor
emeritus of biology at Washington
and Lee University died Monday at
the University of Virginia Hospital in
Charlottesville. He was 74.

The family asks that contributions
be made to the Lexington First Aid
Crew in lieu of flowers.

Starling is survived by his wife,
Nell Lewis Starling of Lexington; a
son, Dr. John Lewis Starling of
Fredericksburg; a brother, Marion
J. Starling of Columbus, Ga.; and a
grandson.

A native of Troy, Ala., Starling
received his bachelor’s and master’s
degrees from the University of
Alabama and his doctorate in zoology
and ecology from Duke University.

Starling joined the faculty of
Washington and Lee in September
1942 and taught for a year before
leaving to spend three years as a
parasitologist in the U.S. Army
Medical Corps. He was named coor-
dinator of premedical studies at the
university in 1963, working with W&L
undergraduates who pursued med-
ical careers.

He served as the head of the W&L
biology department from 1976 until
1978. Starling retired from the
university in 1983.

He was a member of the Sigma Xi
and Alpha Epsilon Delta honorary
societies and the Sigma Alpha Ep-
silon fraternity.

Starling was active in the Lex-
ington Presbyterian Church, the
Tuberculosis Association, and the
Red Cross Blood Bank.

Lexington artists
receive grants

 

By MARY BISHOP
From The Roanoke Times & World-
News

Two artists who live and work here
— photographer Sally Munger Mann
and poet Dabney Stuart — have won
fellowships from the John Simon
Guggenheim Memorial Foundation
of New York.

They are among 273 winners of the
prestigious fellowships selected from
3,421 applicants. The fellows, in-
cluding writers, composers, chore-
ographers, painters, sculptors,
photographers, film makers and
video artists, are chosen for
distinguished past achievement and
promise of future accomplishment.

Mann, who received $25,000, will
use the money for a project she calls
“The Shadow of Sorrow: Teenage
Pregnancy.’’ She said that by
photographing young mothers, she
hopes ‘‘to arouse an active concern
for them, utilizing the medium I feel
most powerful — the evocative por-
trait.”

Her most recent work, titled
“Sweet Silent Thought: Photographs
of Twelve-Year-Old Girls,” deals
with the transformation of little girls
into young women. The photographs,
a source of local controversy, have
been on display in New York, San
Francisco and Washington.

Several years ago, other photo-
graphs were the subject of her book
“Second Sight: The Photographs of
Sally Mann.”’ Her work is in the col-
lections of the Museum of Modern

Art, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the
Hirshhorn Museum and the Chrysler
Museum.

Mann was staff photographer at
Washington and Lee University from
1972 to 1980.

The fellowship comes at a special
time for Stuart, a professor of Eng-
lish at W&L since 1965. His ninth
book, ‘Don’t Look Back,” will be
published this month by the LSU
Press in Baton Rouge.

His other books are “The Diving
Bell,” ‘‘A Particular Place,’ ‘“‘The
Other Hand,” “Friends of Yours,
Friends of Mine,’ ‘Round and
Round,” ‘‘Nabokov: The Dimensions
of Parody,” “Rockbridge Poems’’
and ‘‘Common Ground.”’

Stuart could not be reached Mon-
day but a W&L news release said that
he plans to use his fellowship to fur-
ther examine the themes in “Don’t
Look Back.” Five long poems about
his family were his focal point for the
book.

His poems have appeared in many
magazines, scholarly journals and
anthologies, including ‘“‘The New
Yorker,”’ ‘Southern Poetry Re-
view,’’ ‘‘Ploughshares,’’ ‘‘The
Southern Review,” ‘‘Modern Lan-
guage Quarterly,” ‘Poetry,’ and
“North American Review.”

There were four other Virginia
recipients of this year’s fellowships:
Stephen C. Innes, associate professor
of history at UVa; Paul Mendes-
Flohr, visiting professor of modern
Jewish studies, UVa; James Trefil,
professor of physics at George
Madison University; and Richard
Zenith, an Alexandria translator.

than just test scores, Hartog said.

But that doesn’t mean scores are of
little importance.
’ The first consideration in the ad-
missions process, according to Har-
tog, is a student’s program of study
— the level of performance, the
degree of competition and the quality
of the secondary school as measured
by past graduates who have enrolled
at W&L. The next consideration is the
student’s scores on the SAT and
achievement tests.

Those factors show if the student is
in the competition, Hartog said. Non-
academic data is of little use unless a

student’s academic record places
him or her well within the competi-
tion. After a student has been judged
to be competitive, extra- and co-
curricular activities are considered,
as well as recommendations and in-
terviews.

Hartog said the process shown in
the article is similar to that used at
other selective schools. Interviews,
although highly recommended, do
not weigh heavily when the decisions
are being made.

“The interview is more of an infor-
mation session,’ Hartog said. “‘It’s
just a 30- or 40-minute visit.”’

Hartog said that although coeduca-
tion has helped make the school more
selective, it has not changed the ad-
missions process or the relative im-
portance of the factors considered
when accepting or rejecting stu-
dents.

Those have remained the same for
years, he said.

Baseball splits in doubleheaders; looking for top

 

By STUART SHELDON
‘Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee baseball
‘team, like many other W&L students,
spent much of their spring break
travelling. The team, however, did
not have the luxury of the sunny
beach or the snowy slope that most
students chose. Instead, the main
focus of the team’s week was double-
headers,

On Saturday, April 11, the Generals
hosted Radford, a Divison III team,
in W&L’s first doubleheader of the
break. The Generals split the after-
noon, to a team head coach Jeff

of No. 1 Matthews and McLeod, No. 2
Haley and senior Roby Mize, and No.
3 Morris and Wiman then mopped up
as they won all their matches.

The Swarthmore match was also
sewn up in the singles matches. The
two most thrilling matches were
Wiman’s and Mize’s which each went
the distance of three sets. Wiman
was particularly impressive as he
dropped the first set and was down
5-1 in the second set before making a
remarkable comeback. Mize had to
fight off numerous match points

before winning the match in a third- *

set tiebreaker.

Matthews, McLeod and Haley were
the other singles players to record
wins. The Generals then finished off
the Little Quakers by sweeping the
doubles.

“It was a great team effort,’’ said
head coach Gary Franke. ‘‘Everyone
gave their best effort and the results
are very rewarding.”

Another great effort was going to
be needed over spring break as the

match swing through Florida against

challenge.

The Generals defeated St. Leo and
Stetson each by the score of 9-0. A 5-4
win over North Florida assured the

though the squad lost though match-

+ The undefeated Washington and

track team is preparing for the
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
thampionship meet, which will be
held at Bridgewater College Satur-
day. The Generals competed in the
Catholic University Invitational last
weekend, the first meet for the full
squad since March 24 and W&L’s
final meet before the conference
championship.

The Catholic Invitational ‘wasn’t
‘one of our better meets, and yet it
svasn’t a bad meet,” said head coach
Norris Aldridge. Junior Joseph
Fisher set a new personal record in
he pole vault by clearing 13’6”’, a full
foot higher than his previous best.
‘Freshman Wes Boyd also set a new
PR, finishing the 200-meter run in
22.6 seconds. Junior Andy White
reached the finals in the 110-meter

high hurdles with a time of 15.1
seconds. In the weight events, senior
Thomas Murray took third place in
the shot put, and sophomore James
Ambrosini placed fourth in the
discus.

Looking ahead to this weekend,
Aldridge is concerned about the
sprinters and long jumpers from
Bridgewater and the distance run-
ners and hurdlers from Roanoke Col-
lege. Nevertheless, “if we go down
with a good mental attitude and get
good performances, then we'll have a
chance to win [the conference title],”’
said Aldridge.

W&L should have the number one
position in at least four events.
Aldridge expects Murray to be seed-
ed first in the shot put. Boyd will pro-
bably be in the top position in both the
100- and 200-meter runs, and White
should be the top seed in the 110-
meter hurdles. Also, Fisher will pro-
bably be tied for the number one spot
in the pole vault, and the W&L 400-

The United States Intercollegiate
Lacrosse Association has smiled on
* Lexington.
, The USILA, responsible for rank-
ng the nation’s collegiate lacrosse
teams, put the Washington and Lee
. lacrosse squad atop the latest Divi-
sion III poll. The Generals were rank-
’ ed seventh in the preseason poll and
, then second in the initial regular
season poll.

But, in order to keep their ranking,
, the Generals are going to have to

keep on winning — and the news from
’ Farmville was good in that respect.
, W&L traveled to Hampden-Sydney

this past Saturday and used an ex-
* ceptionally good third quarter to sub-
, due the Tigers by a score of 16-6. The
Generals’ 10th consecutive win put
their record at 10-1.

W&L held a slim 7-5 lead going into
the third period but lit the scoreboard
* with six unanswered goals to seal the
, victory.

For the year, the Generals have
* outscored their opponents 47-14 in the
, third quarter.

‘T don’t know what it is,” said W&L
head coach Dennis Daly of the third-
, quarter scoring. “I was shocked

when I first saw the numbers.

’ “Maybe we get stronger as we go

along,” said Daly. ‘Whatever it is, I

hope it keeps up.’’

Junior Pete Smith was the leading
scorer for the Generals in the
Hampden-Sydney game with four
goals.

Junior Sandy Harrison continued
to win the faceoffs; he won 19 of 24
(79.2% ) on Saturday. His season total
is an outstanding 186 of 269, or 69.1%.

Looking ahead to this weekend, the
Generals will be on the road again,
this time at Chestertown, Md., to face
Washington College.

The Sho’men have a 7-6 record and
are ranked seventh in the nation.
W&L has lost two consecutive years
to Washington College, both times by
a single goal. The Sho’men won 14-13
in overtime at Chestertown two years
ago and 11-10 in Lexington last year.

‘Washington College is a very good
team with a balanced lineup,” said
Daly. ‘“‘They have some losses, but
most of them came at the hands of
top-ranked Division I teams.”’

The Generals’ next home game,
their last of the regular season, will
be Wednesday against the Roanoke
Maroons. The Maroons have never
lost an Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference title, or even an ODAC game.
Wednesday’s game will be the first
ODAC contest between the two
teams.

The Maroons are currently ranked
eighth in the D-III lacrosse poll and,
since only the first eight teams go to
the playoffs, they will be looking to
knock off the Generals.

meter relay team is expected to
share the top seed in that event with
Bridgewater.

“The winners are important, but

what’s really going to be important is
second through sixth,’’ says
Aldridge. The points for the non-
medal places made all the difference
in the indoor championship meet,
and a victory this Saturday will re-
quire just as much depth, according
to Aldridge.
MILEPOSTS — Some individual
results from the Division II & Ill
state meet, held in Hampton on April
11: junior Richard Moore placed se-
cond in the 1500-meter run (4.04, a
personal best), sophomore Jamie Ur-
so took third place in the 800-meter
run (1:57), and Murray was third in
the shot put (48°6’’).... W&L will con-
tinue competition even after the
ODAC season is over. The Generals
are scheduled to compete in invita-
tional meets at James Madison cn
May 2 and UVa. on May 9.

support from the rest of the team.
After winning the first game, the
Generals stranded 14 baserunners in
the nightcap, wasting Steuart’s out-
standing two hit effort.

The Generals now stand at 6-12
overall, 4-8 in the ODAC. Stickley
said that “we are playing better,
good enough to have a shot’ at
finishing in the top five in next week’s
ODAC tournament.

The team has two more games [at
Eastern Mennonite on April 22, and
Christopher Newport at home at 3
p.m. on April 24] in which to fine tune
for the tournament.

“The last few games are the most
important tous,” said Stickley.

As the Washington and Lee
women’s tennis team prepares for
the upcominig Old Dominion Athletic
Conference Championships it ap-
pears to be in very good shape. The
team has won it’s last three matches
and the team members are confident
going inot the tournament.

Yesterday, the Lady Generals
traveled to Mary Baldwin and came
back with a 6-3 win to put their season
record at 5-3.

Yesterday’s match was even after
the singles matches with Bitsy Hop-
per, Valerie Pierson, and Benny
Savage all winning for the Lady
Generals.

W&L, however swept the singles
matches to take the victory.

The Lady Generals also won on
Tuesday at Sweet Briar by a 5-4
score.

Winning singles matches for the
Lady Generals in their match against
Sweet Briar were Hopper, Teresa
Southard, and Katherine Nelligan.
Battling out of the singles matches
with an even score, W&L’s doubles

teams proved to be too much for their
opponents. The team of Hopper and
Dana Anstine as well as the team of
Southard and Eggers won to seal the
victory.

Over the past couple of weeks the
team has hit rough waters. The team
lost a couple of 5-4 decisions to
Randolph-Macon Woman's College
and Bridgewater, and also lost 9-0 to
Emory and Henry, the team they will
probably have to face in the upcom-
ing Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference Championship. The Lady
Generals then bounced back to sur-
pass Roanoke 9-0 and defeated Sweet
Briar.

The ODAC championships will be
held this weekend at Sweet Briar.
Head coach Bill Washburn is very
hopeful. ‘‘I am very much encourag-
ed,” said Washburn. “I think it is
possible for us to make a good show-
ing.”

Last year was a disappointment for
the team, but it was only the team’s
first year of existence.

“Last year we had no idea how
they even ran it,” said Hopper in
reference to the tournament. With a
better understanding of the tourna-
ment, the Lady Generals should be
able to make a better showing.

Golf has problem with layoff

By MIKE SHADY
Assistant Sports Editor

To emulate ESPN’s Chris Berman,
way back back back back back back
back on March 24, the Washington
and Lee golf team came in first place
in one of those Old Dominion Athletic
Conference round-robin tourna-
ments. If that seems like ages ago,
you are correct. March 24 was 11
days before exams even started.

At the Countryside Club in
Roanoke on Monday, after 27 days of
non-competitive golf, the Generals
dusted off their clubs and slugged
their way to a third-place tie in the
final ODAC tournament of the season
before the ODAC championships.
W&L tied Randolph-Macon at 336
while the home team Roanoke
prevailed with a 322. Bridgewater
grabbed second place by carding a
329.

“Tt was our first competition in 27
days,”’ said head coach Buck Leslie.
“We were just hoping to get out
alive.”’

 

Junior John Gammage led the
Generals with a 79, followed by
sophomore Pete Coleman and senior
Mark Zavatsky, who each scored an
83. Junior Chip Gist, usually the low
scorer for W&L, managed a some-
what disappointing 88.

“Chip just had a bad round,” said
Leslie. He can come back.”’

Leslie explained that the long
layoff between matches was not due
to a scheduling error, but because of
a conflict with W&L’s exam period
and spring break.

“During exams, we miss two tour-
naments and this year Georgetown
{the Georgetown Invitational] was
cancelled. There wasn’t anything we
could get into.

“We like to pick up [a match] at
the end of break but this time there
was no place for us to go,”’ he said.

The Generals will now prepare for
the ODAC championships, which will
be held on the same course in
Roanoke on April 27-28. W&L made a
trip to Roanoke yesterday in order to
play a practice round.

track hopes to garner ODAC ‘s

By JIM LAKE
Staff Reporter

 

The W&L track team will almost
certainly be without one of its top
performers in this weekend’s Old
Dominion Athletic Conference cham-
pionship meet. Senior John Burlin-
game, the 1987 ODAC indoor long
jump champion and one of W&L’s
best runners, pulled a hamstring at
the Catholic University Invitational
last Saturday.

Burlingame strained his hamstring
in the middle of March, and W&L
head coach Norris Aldridge had held
him out of competition since then.
But last week Aldridge decided to
enter Burlingame in the 400-meter
relay in the Catholic Invitational.

“It wasn't really a bad pull,” said

 

Aldridge. ‘‘We thought he was ready
[to come back], and we wanted to
test it before ODAC’s.’’ When Bur-
lingame took the baton in the final leg
of the 400 relay, the Generals ap-
peared to be on their way to a school
record. Instead, he pulled up about 50
yards short of the finish line.

However, Burlingame, a member
of Phi Kappa Sigma, did play intra-
mural basketball for his fraternity. _

Burlingame originally denied hav-
ing played in Wednesday night’s IM
game against Sigma Alpha Epsilon,
but later admitted that he had
played.

“Yeah, I did play basketball,”
Burlingame said, ‘‘but sprinting is an
entirely different ball game. You
have to go 100 percent all the time.”

Burlingame said that he had

Burlingame injured; is doubtful for meet

bicycled 10 miles Wednesday and had
been seeing the trainer twice daily.
He said he did not play an IM game
Tuesday night, but Wednesday night
he felt that he could play at half
speed.

Senior Jefferson Harralson, who
officiated Wednesday’s game, said
that Burlingame’s performance was
affected.

“He made it known he was hurt,
and pulled up short a couple of
times,” said Harralson.

Burlingame said that Wednesday
night’s game ‘‘was very, very impor-
tant tome” and to his fraternity.

Looking ahead to this weekend’s
conference championship meet,
Burlingame said that he may still be
able to compete in the long jump, but
the decision would not be made until
later in the week.

 

 

 

 

 

JOHN MORRIS

ALERTS RCTS ALE; A SRT EE

By JOHN PACKETT
Staff Reporter

 

Freshman tennis player John
Morris from Memphis, Tenn., has
been selected as Washington and
Lee’s Athlete of the Week.

Morris, the General’s number
six seed, was undefeated in
singles in the team’s last five
matches. Morris also teamed up
with Chris Wiman at the number
three doubles spot to go 4-0 over
the last week.

‘‘A big help for me was beating
a guy on the Rollins team who I
practice with some in the sum-
mer. He usually beats me when-
ever we play, so it was a big win,”’
said Morris.

Morris defeated his Rollins op-
ponent 2-6, 6-2 and 6-2.

In last Thursday’s match
against Flagler he had an easy
time defeating his opponent 6-3
and 6-1. Then on Friday he had to
go to a third set to defeat his

[ W&L Athlete of the Week’

University of Northern Florida
opponent 6-7, 6-2 and 6-2.

“The singles win in the Rollins
match set the tone for the rest of
the week and gave me momen-
tum,” said Morris.

In Tuesday’s match against
Christopher Newport College
Morris found himself playing at
the number three spot because of
injury. He still won easily.

In yesterday’s match against
Averett he won playing at the
number four position.

The Generals are playing in the
ODAC tournament this weekend
and the Nationals are coming up
soon, so the team will be practic-
ing a lot harder and longer.

Morris said he doesn’t mind the
practice because tennis is very
fun for him and he said that he
would be lost without it this
spring.

Morris started playing tennis
when he was eight and then

Striving for Success

It’s right there, printed on the
Heinsohn and Day schedule.

February 16 — ‘‘The Tonight Show
with Johnny Carson.”’

Several W&L students believed it,
including one of the music directors
of WLUR.

Was the acoustic guitar duo of
W&L graduates Eric Heinsohn '83
and Roger Day ’85 really going to be
on national television?

No, not really.

But the schedule was right about
the duo playing for the Georgia Con-
gressional delegation in Washington,
De,

And they weren’t joking about
playing at bars in Atlanta, Birm-
ingham, Mobile, and Lexington, and
at colleges in at least four states.

They’re not kidding now, when
they say they’re giving a recital in
Lee Chapel at 8 p.m. Monday.

A recital? By a bar band? Inside
“The Shrine of the South’’?

That’s right.

It’s an opportunity to hear, without
electric amplification, the original
compositions of Heinsohn and Day.

Day said he hopes that since the
recital will be unamplified, people
will sit down and listen to the music.

‘‘When we do at a fraternity party
what's unique to Heinsohn and Day,
it’s almost impossible for anything to
come through just because of the
framework that we're operating in,”’
Day said.

“Put us in a different framework,
put us in a hall with 300 or 400 people
who are expecting to hear original
music — who would be disappointed
if you don’t play it — and I think we
would be very pleasing to them,” he
said.

Heinsohn and Day have had the
chance to play for audiences expec-
ting original music when they open
for bands in Atlanta, Day said.

“*We walk in and we do nothing but
Heinsohn and Day stuff, and they
love it,” he said. “It’s weird for Eric
and me to do it because we don’t have
people screaming for Jimmy Buffett
or ‘Brown-eyed Girl.’ ”’

But Heinsohn said the recital does
not signal an end to what area fans
have come to expect from Heinsohn
and Day.

Usually, a Heinsohn and Day con-
cert consists primarily of music by

G-men
carry
Weapon

By MICHAEL TUGGLE
Staff Reporter

 

In the beginning he _ lived
dangerously, then he became mad,
and now he is a killing machine.
Whatever the case may be, there is
no question; Mel Gibson is definitely
making his mark in the world of
Hollywood tough guys.

His new film Lethal Weapon, a
blend of To Live and Die in L.A.,
Sharkey’s Machine, and Running
Scared again allows Gibson to ex-
ecute the crazed warrior character
that he has developed so well over the
course of his previous films. Much of
his success in this film, however,
comes from playing off co-star Dan-
ny Glover.

As always, Danny Glover’s perfor-
mance is excellent. Known primarily
for his roles as an oppressed black in
Places in the Heart, The Color Purple,
and Mandela, Glover moves into his
role as commanding officer with the
grace and style that is synonymous
with him. Together, he and Gibson
make Lethal Weapon a classic good
guys, bad guys adventure.

The film opens with a beautiful girl
mysteriously diving to her death
from the window of her penthouse
balcony. Through Glover’s careful
investigation and Gibson’s neurotic
shoot-to-kill back-up, the pair
discovers that there is more to the
case than a simple suicide, and find
themselves caught up in the nar-
cotics underground.

While this premise may seem old
hand, it is not. Glover and Gibson’s
intensity and humor make this film
incredibly enjoyable. Danny Glover
is an extreme pleasure to watch and
is faultless as the commanding of-
ficer. Mel Gibson however, steals the
show as the psycho cop, maintaining
the perfect amount of intensity in
stringing along the audience’s
conclusions concerning his mental
state. In addition, Gary Bussey puts
in a quality performance as Mr.
Joshua.

If you enjoyed To Live and Die in
L.A. Or Sharkey’s Machine , then don’t
miss Lethal Weapon. It’s a great cop
movie and a really enjoyable two
hours.

other songwriters, with several
originals included.

An audience can expect to hear
anything from Bruce Springsteen to
the Grateful Dead, with standards in-
cluding Jimmy Buffett, Simon and
Garfunkel, the Beatles, Crosby, Stills
and Nash, Mike Cross and Dire
Straits.

Heinsohn and Day have even
managed to perform a medley of
television theme songs.

They will still perform shows of
that format, but the recital in Lee
Chapel will allow them to present a
program of their own work.

“Tt’s not like this is a break, that
this is the end of what you know about
Heinsohn and Day and the start of
something new about Heinsohn and
Day,’ Heinsohn said. “It’s transi-
tional to some extent.”

The two musicians have wanted to
play their own songs since they
began seriously pursuing a career in
music in late summer of 1985.

“We had envisioned all along that
we would probably move to a bigger
market,’’ Heinsohn said, ‘‘so that we
could talk to record companies, play
more original music, play more
nights of the week without overexpos-
ing ourselves.”

Day said they also wanted to move
away from Lexington ‘‘so that we
wouldn't get labeled as just Roger
and Eric hanging around.”’

He said the furthest thing from his
mind was reliving his college ex-
perience by playing at parties and
bars.

“The big irony of Heinsohn and
Day is that we didn’t party that much
while we were in college,”’ Day said.
He said he would not have been the
type of student who would spend time
in bars listening to bands like Hein-
sohn and Day. “My studies were
much more important than that,”
Day said.

That scholarly background some-
times hinders the duo in their deal-
ings with bar managers and other
possible employers.

Day said, ‘‘The guys who would
like being in bars anyway but who
also play music have an ‘in’ with the
crowd that we don’t have, and have
an ‘in’ with the management that we
don’t have because they’re sort of
partying with everyone else.

“There’s something to say for that
leading to connections that we don’t
have.”

Heinsohn and Day playing earlier this year.

But they have to make a living
somehow. As Day put it, ‘‘We’re not
in a position yet to just say, ‘This is
what we do. This is Heinsohn and
Day and if you don’t like it then you
don’t have to come hear us.’ We still
have to appeal to a larger audience,
so that the rent gets paid.”

Both musicians admit that having
the financial and marketing backing
of the national commercial music in-
dustry would be beneficial, but they
are more concerned with their art.

“The primary goal is being free to
record and perform our own music
and be able to make a living at it,”’
Heinsohn said.

Day added that their aim is to have
national recognition but not neces-
sarily national commercial success.

He named several musicians
—such as Mike Cross and Tony Rice
—as examples of the type of success
Heinsohn and Day are looking for.

Tsuxma to perform
Japanese Noh theater

By TOM BRICKEL
Staff Reporter

 

The meeting of East and West
comes alive in Lexington and at W&L
this weekend when Tsuxma, a
Japanese Noh Theatre troupe, ar-
rives in Lexington for the second stop
of its first concert tour in the United
States.

Composed of six professionals,
Tsuxma will present a performance
at 8 p.m., Saturday in the Lime Kiln
Theatre in Lexington. The troupe will
present a free lecture/demonstration
at 8 p.m. Sunday in Lee Chapel.

There is an admission charge for
the Lime Kiln performance.

Noh Theatre, dating back to the
14th century, is the world’s oldest
professional theatre tradition still be-
ing performed. Despite its age, it is
not unlike Western theatre in its use
of musical, dramatic, and dance
elements.

“There is a major difference,
however, in that, by stressing the
music and dance involved with per-
formance, Noh tends to be less
realistic than contemporary

drama,” notes Minor Rogers, pro-
fessor of religion at Washingtor and
Lee.

According to Rogers, Noh’s
avoidance of reality reflects on the
Buddhist influence in Chinese and
Japanese popular and _ classical
dance. “The beauty striven for in
Noh is not an objective aesthetic
quality, but one which can only be
achieved through the viewer’s par-
ticipation and appreciation of the
symbols,’ said Rogers.

“The beautiful costumes and
delicate masks are designed not to
convey reality, but to add to the emo-
tional impact of the actions,’’ Rogers
said. ‘‘Pure emotions are the heart
and soul of Noh.”

The activity in Noh plays largely
involves dancing accompanied by
singing of chants by a chorus and in-
strumental music performed by the
Noh Hayashi orchestra. Tragic loves
and heroic deeds of the ancient past
are the subjects of the songs and
chants.

The instrumental music of Noh is
called “hayashi’’ and consists of a

Rockin’ Rick highlights the Stones

“GIDAWFFF!!”

Although many people use the
phrase ‘‘get off,” no one growls it out
quite like gravel-voiced Rick Pierce.
And for the next four Saturdays,
while most Washington and Lee
students are still asleep or just stag-
gering out of bed, ‘‘Rockin’ Rick”’
will be gettin’ off in a big way.

Pierce will be capping off four
years on the staff of WLUR-FM,
W&L’s campus radio station, with a
series of Saturday morning specials.

From 8:30 until noon this Saturday,
Pierce will broadcast a 25th anniver-
sary tribute to the Rolling Stones.

And for the following three Satur-
days, from 9 til noon, he’ll be deejay-
ing a countdown of the top 92 rock ‘n’
roll hits ever.

The Stones special will be a
chronological mix of music and talk,
with much of the emphasis on the
early years, 1963-71. Pierce has the
show all scripted, although he ex-
pects to ad-lib much of it.

Considering his extensive
knowledge of the Stones, Pierce pro-
bably could ad-lib the whole show.
Red-haired Rick has been a loyal
Mick Jagger fan since he was a stu-
dent at Cumberland Valley High
School in Mechanicsburg, Pa.

He owns all the Stones’ American
releases — about 35 total — and some
imports. He has numerous books,

photos and posters. He’s seen three
Rolling Stones movies, has a collec-
tion of their videos and saw them in
concert in Philadelphia in 1981.

“Tt was just a knockout when I saw
them,” Pierce said. ‘The air was so
electric. Everybody on the field was
going wild.

“They didn’t even sound that
great,” Pierce said, but it was ex-
citing just to be there.

He said he was impressed by the
Stones’ stage show and special ef-
fects, especially compared to
another rocker he’s seen in concert
— Bruce Springsteen.

“It (Springsteen) had to be the
most boring show that I’ve seen as
far as special effects,” Pierce said.
“He stands there and sings.”’

But that doesn’t mean the Boss
won’t get any airplay when Pierce
counts down rock’s best on May 9,
May 16, and May 23. In fact, Spring-
steen is tied for number 91 with a
song that Pierce would describe only
as ‘‘very popular”’ with teens in June.

ft has been suggested to Pierce
that since WLUR operates on a fre-
quency of 91.5 megahertz, he should
play 9112 songs. Instead, he decided
on a tie for number 91, just so he
could add an extra tune.

Unlike most countdowns, Pierce’s
includes both album-oriented rock
— your Led Zeppelins and Lynyrd
Skynyrds — and pop hits by the likes
of Madonna, Michael Jackson and

Greeks will help local
charities with special week

 

By SAMUEL FOLEY
Staff Reporter

 

Go Greeks! is the theme for next
week’s first annual Washington and
Lee Greek Week. The Interfraternity
Council has a series of events plan-
ned for next week that will raise
money for charity and provide the
fraternities with a chance to have a
great deal of fun.

Greek Week begins on Monday
with an “‘Oozeball”’ tournament to be
held behind the Phi Kappa Psi frater-
nity house.

What is oozeball? Well, according
to former IFC President Chris Sax-
man, it is volleyball that is played in
mud, The tournament will last two
days and will be a double-elimination
tournament. When asked about
where the idea for oozeball origi-
nated Saxman just smiled and said
he had read about it somewhere.

On Wednesday there will be a
series of bedraces_ tentatively

scheduled to be held outside of the
Woods Creek Apartments. Prizes will
be awarded to the finishers and to the
team with the best design.

A double-elimination softball tour-
nament will be held Thursday after-
noon, Saxman explained that in order
for the tournament to be finished in
one day four fields will be used at
once.

Thursday evening there will be a
concert at the Huntley. Pavilion
featuring the Limit and Skip Castro.
The party is being billed as a toga
party and beer will be served.

The IFC is offering incentives for
people to wear togas. Fraternity
members who wear togas will get in-
to the concert for free. Fraternity
members who do not wear togas will
be charged a $5 admission fee.

Those who do not belong to frater-
nities but do wear togas must pay $5.
Non-fraternity members who go sans
toga will pay $10 to get in.

On Friday and Saturday the frater-
nities will take turns soliciting funds
for the United Way and the Lexington

Completion

Gaines Hall is expected to be finished by the fall

By MARGARET PIMBLETT
Staff Reporter

 

Despite a harsh winter and near-
flooding over spring break, construc-
tion of Gaines Hall should be com-
pleted in plenty of time for next
year’s residents, according to Frank
Parsons, the assistant to the presi-
dent.

The new residence hall at the cor-
ner of Washington and Nelson streets
should be completed by July 31, Par-
sons said.

““As of two weeks ago, the contrac-
tor felt the project was running three
weeks behind schedule because of the

snow and other weather considera-
tions,’’ Parsons said.

Parsons said he sat in on a job con-
ference last Thursday among the
general contractor, J.M. Turner and
Associates of Salem, and the various
subcontractors working on the build-
ing.

“I was impressed at the conference
with the understanding and the spirit
of cooperation of the contractors and
subcontractors,”’ Parsons said.

The companies were aware of the
need for the building to be completed
on schedule and expected to make
the deadline, Parsons said.

“They know of no reason, barring
unforeseen disaster, why Gaines Hall

On Monday, May 11, the IFC will
sponsor a golf tournament at the Lex-
ington Golf and Country Club in order
to raise money for the American
Cancer Society.

Each house is sponsoring a four-
some, and a foursome will also be
sponsored by the administration,
featuring President Wilson.

The IFC has ordered T-shirts and
hopes to create a great deal of excite-
ment for the whole week. ‘The en-
thusiasm is the key to the entire
week. Hopefully, it will improve rela-
tions between fraternities and the
community and raise money for
charity while having a good time,”’
Saxman said.

The winners of all the events, in-
cluding the winners of the golf tour-
nament and the house that raises the
most money on Friday and Saturday,
will receive 17 points, the second-
place finisher 16, third place 15 and
so on. The overall points champion
will win the First Annual Washington
and Lee Greek Week Trophy.

will not be completed,”’ he said.

The residence hall will be ready for
occupancy for the fall, although some
landscaping and finishing work may
remain to be done, Parsons said.

Interior work may not be com-
pleted on the rotunda area before fall
term classes start, according to Par-
sons.

He added, however, that any work
still in progress will not disturb the
residents.

Parsons said that although the out-
side of the building is under construc-
tion, work on the interior has begun
and will continue while the exterior is
completed

Covention
will begin
on Saturday

From Staff Reports

 

Washington and Lee’s mock con-
stitutional convention, believed to be
the only exercise of its kind in the
United States during the bicentennial
year of the U.S. Constitution, will
convene at 9:30 a.m. Saturday at
Warner Center.

More than 1,000 W&L students and
students from the area’s women’s
colleges are expected to participate
in the convention, The event is open
to the public.

The W&L constitutional convention
differs from other events honoring
the U.S. Constitution in that it is not a
reenactment, but an actual conven-
tion in which five different amend-
ments will be debated and voted.

Following the call to order by
Chairman Peter Bennorth, a W&L
senior from Wyckoff, N.J., and the
invocation, W&L President John D.
Wilson will deliver a welcoming ad-
dress. Fred Graham, former CBS
chief legal correspondent, will then
deliver the keynote speech at 10 a.m.

Debate on the first issue, the call
for a balanced budget amendment,
will begin at 11 a.m. John Gunn,
associate professor of economics at
W&L, will speak in faver of the
amendment; John Winfrey, pro-
fessor of economics, will speak
against the amendment. The conven-
tion will then adjourn for lunch at

 

 

St ae

12:30 p.m.

Debate on the second issue, the
right-to-life admendment, will begin
at 2 p.m. Samuel Calhoun, associate
professor of law, will speak in favor
of the amendment; Pamela Simpson,
professor of art history, will speak
against the issue.

The third issue, the states’ powers
amendment, will be debated at 3:30
p.m. Markham Pyle, a second-year
law student at W&L, will argue the
pro perspective; Mark Grunewald,
professor of law, will speak against
the amendment.

Following adjournment for dinner,
the convention will reconvene at 7
p.m. for debate on the fifth and final
issue, the Equal Rights Amendment.
Lewis LaRue, professor of law and
director of the Lewis Law Center at
W&L, will speak in favor of the
amendment; Roger Dean, associate
professor of administration, will
speak against the issue.

The convention will adjourn at 10
p.m. A concert featuring Little Saints
is scheduled for the student pavilion
following the convention.

Registration will be held Friday
from 1-4 p.m. in front of the Co-op and
in room 113 of the University Center,
and also Saturday morning, 8-9:30, in
the Warner Center. Registration is
open to both those who are already in
a delegation and those who want to
join a delegation.

 

 

 

 

George’s new coat

By W. Patrick Hinley/W&L.

“Old George’ (Washington, that is) gets a fresh coat of white paint from
Washington and Lee University buildings and grounds painters Kenneth
Swink (left) and Dennis Smith. The statue of Washington, which sits atop
Washington Hall on the Front Campus, has been painted more than 100

times.

to proceed, the underroofing is being
reinforced to prevent any rain
damage.

The main roof requires more time
to install, Parsons said, because it is
a virtually maintenance-free copper
roof that must be built by skilled
workers.

Parsons said that another reason
the building appears less complete is
because the work progresses in
stages, with the Washington Street
wing to be finished first, then the
Nelson Street wing, and finally the
wing next to St. Patrick’s Church.

The upper floors will be completed
first in each wing so that the con-
struction workers will not need to

enter finished floors to reach their
work areas,

When completed, Gaines Resi-
dence Hall will supply 248 beds, 13 of
which will be taken by the eight resi
dent assistants.

Of the remaining 235 beds, 159 have
already been contracted, with 10 law
and 149 undergraduate residents. Of
those students, 97 are women

Parsons said he is not surprised by
the 67 percent occupancy rate, and
would be concerned if Gaines were
full next year.

“If we had a 100 percent occupancy
rate, we'd have to start looking at
where to build the next dorm,” Par
sons said.

“You MEAN AFTER FOUR YEARS, ALL YOU CAN SAY 1S, ‘IT LOOKS LIKE A ROCK’ ?”

Positive

Often fraternities complain that only the negative things
they do make the headlines of The Ring-tum Phi. It’s true
that often the news pages mention fraternities only when a
student has fallen out of a house window or when the IFC has
decided to ban kegs at parties or some similar landmark
decision. Happily, this week we can mention a positive activi-
ty in which hopefully all of W&L’s fraternities will partici-

te.
ee the coming week, W&L will hold its first an-
nual Greek Week. The festivities will include ‘oozeball,’ bed
racing, separate golf and softball tournaments, as well as a
toga party. The money raised from the activities will be
donated to the local United Way and to the local shelter for
the homeless.

It’s commendable that W&L’s fraternities are making a
unified effort to raise money for charity. Certainly, this
seems to be a perfect example of the good fraternities can do
for the community, and the adininistration, as well as the stu-
dent media sources, should take note.

No, fraternities are not all bad. Fraternity activities do not
always end in police reports. The Ring-tum Phi is pleased to
be able to mention something the fraternities are doing that
positively affect the community. We hope to see Greek Week
become a time-honored tradition and look forward to seeing
more positive fraternity activities.

Opportunity

Now’s your chance! If you’ve been belly-aching all year
about the Phi, put your money where your mouth is and apply
to become editor for 1987-88. The Publications Board is look-
ing for a few good men and women to run the University’s
student newspaper. The positions of editor and business
manager are chosen by the Publications Board. Students in-
terested in the position should turn in an application listing
qualifications to Carol Calkins’ office as soon as possible. Ap-
plicants will be interviewed by the Publications Board ina
meeting next week.

If you are interested in working as an editor of a specific
section of the Phi (news, sports, entertainment, editorial
page), you should apply in the Phi office. Next year’s editor
makes appointments to these positions, so these editors won’t
oe chosen until next year’s editor has been selected.

The Calyx is also looking for an editor and business
manager for next year. Students interested in that position
should also turn in applications to Carol Calkins.

Now’s your chance. Don’t miss it.

300d job

While the results of yesterday’s lacrosse game against
Roanoke were heartbreaking, the team and coaches
leserve to be commended for a great effort. It was par-
icularly encouraging to see so many fans in the stands.
{opefully, in years to come such a large crowd turnout will
ecome a regular sight. W&L’s student atheletes work hard
nd devote a large part of their free time to their sport. They
eserve the fans’ support.

The Ring-tum Phiis published every Thursday during the undergraduate school year at
Washington and Lee University, Lexington, Virginia. Funding for The Ring-tum Phi
comes primarily from advertising and from a portion of the student activities fee. The
Publications Board elects the chief editors and business manager, but The Ring-tum Phi
is otherwise independent.

Letters to the Editor and submissions must be in The Ring-tum Phi office, Room 200 of
the Student Center, by 5 p.m. Tuesday of the week they are to be run. Or send them to The
Ring-tum Phi, Box 899, Lexington, VA 24450. This newspaper observes current court
definitions of libel and obscenity.

The Ring-tum Phi, April 30, 1987

 

To The Editors:

I want to express my thanks to the Phi for bringing re-
cent articles from the Roanoke paper concerning the ad-
missions process here to the attention of the W&L com-
munity. It was certainly interesting to see that local jour-
nalism views the Admissions Office in the same way as
many students have come to see it: an almost mythic
summit where Olympian forces of great power casually
decide the fates of men (and, yes, women). The “ar-
rogance,”’ which Mr. Hartog made a point of disputing,
certainly did come out of the description of his office,
which lent itself well to a parallel with the posse of swag-
gering cowboys who inhabit the smoke-filled rooms of the
National Security Council. That is not to say that the pro-
spective ‘‘gentlemen”’ (and “‘ladies’’ — no, too much like
a restroom — how about “‘gentlewomen’”’?) favored by
Mr. Hartog’s admissions criteria are in any way com-
parable to the moral equivalent of Washington, Jeffer-
son, and, I guess, Lee, to be found in the Contras of Lt.
Col. North. The real question seems to be whether Mr.
Hartog’s gleeful triumphal procession of numbers —
SATs and grades — might not crush some potential
scholars under its rude wheels.

If I were the slave placed on Mr. Hartog’s speeding
chariot to remind him of mutability of all fame, I would
whisper to him not that admissions standards could some
day drop, but that after a while of his new-and-improved-
W&L, admissions standards would be the only thing of
importance here. But, would he care? In his numerology

 

 

LETTERS

Admission ‘summit’ galls student

of comparable, objectitiable standards, individual poten-
tial seems to have little place: what emphasis, for exam-
ple, does Mr. Hartog put on an admissions essay, or
recommendations (I know that he considers the latter
dishonest fluff to bolster a ‘‘weak”’ candidacy)?

I personally would not have gotten into the new super-
popular W&L — my high school record was bad; yet I
won't aplogize for it. Not to include myself in their
number, I know good students here — honors and Phi
Beta Kappa — who would also probably be excluded from
Mr. Hartog’s Elysian Fields. On the other hand, I have
seen smug new W&L’ers (obviously “strong can-
didates’”’) who can barely handle the work geared to
those of us who “snuck in’ when admissions were
“‘slack.”’ I like coed and a better reputation for the school,
but I don’t like to have false judgments of value shoved in
my face, so as to make me, and all my pre-coed class-
mates, feel how just plain lucky we are to be at a place’so
nifty — a place that repudiates us by placing its bets on
freshmen yet unborn.

But what triumphant general ever listened to a slave? I
realize, too that Mr. Hartog is not Zeus, but just a func-
tionary doing his assigned job, just following orders. I ad-
dress myself, then, to those who have a real stake in
liberal education — the students, the faculty, and Dr.
Wilson, a scholar in his own right: is expediency a good
enough excuse to replace a college with a cross-section of
respectable automatons?

Reader notes ‘The Code of Gentlemen’

To The Editor:

In looking over old Ring Tum-Phis from the
past few months (yes, there are a few of us out
here who do still read it) I have noticed that what
seems to be an inordinate number of LETTERS
TO THE EDITOR and MY VIEWS that are solely
dedicated to defining ‘‘a gentleman.”’ It’s an im-
portant issue when you consider our entire Honor
Code was founded upon Lee’s definition of a
gentleman. Therefore, if you can stand just one
more letter on the subject, I'd like to offer you
The Code of Gentlemen. It’s the best definition of
a gentleman I have ever seen...

Without a strict observance of the fundamental
Code of Honor, no man, no matter how ‘“‘polish-
ed,’’ can be considered a gentleman. The honor
of a gentleman demands the inviolability of his
word, and the incorruptibility of his principles.
He is the descendent of the knight, the crusader,
he is the defender of the defenseless and the
champion of justice — or he is not a gentleman.

A Gentleman....

DOES NOT discuss his family affairs in public or
with acquaintances.

DOES NOT speak more than casually about his
wife or girl friend.

DOES NOT go to a lady’s house if he is affected
by alcohol. He is temperate in the use of alcohol.
DOES NOT lose his temper, nor exhibit anger,
fear, hate, embarrassment, ardor or hilarity in
public.

DOES NOT hail a lady from a club window.

A Gentleman NEVER discusses the merits or
demerits of a lady.

DOES NOT mention names exactly as he avoids
the mention of what things cost.

DOES NOT borrow money from a friend, except
in dire need. Money borrowed is a debt of honor,
and must be repaid as promptly as possible.
Debts incurred by a deceased parent, brother,
sister or grown child are assumed by honorable
men as a debt of honor.

DOES NOT display his wealth, money or posses-
sions.

DOES NOT put his manners on and off, whether
in the club or ina ballroom. He treats people with
courtesy, no matter what their social positions
may be.

DOES NOT slap strangers on the back nor so
muchas lay a finger ona lady.

DOES NOT “‘lick the boots of those above him”’
nor “kick the face of those below him on the
social ladder.’’

DOES NOT take advantage of another’s help-
lessness or ignorance and assumes that no gen-
tleman will take advantage of him.

A Gentleman respects the reserves of others, but
demands that others respect those which are his.
A Gentleman CAN become what he wills to be...

The authors of this piece (I hesitate to say ina
W&L newspaper, for fear of diminishing the im-
pact the piece might have otherwise made) were
cadets — their exact names unknown. You can
find it hanging on the second floor of LeJeune
Hall at VMI and in old copies of the ‘‘rat bible”
(a booklet that all the first-year students are re-
quired to carry around and memorize). The
CODE was supposedly a class gift to the school
compiled by several cadets.

Darrell thanks lip synch-ers

To the Editors:

It was great — a hit. If you weren’t one of the
150 who attended, you missed a great time. The
first annual Lip Synch contest to benefit Multiple
Sclerosis was an overwhelming success. Sixteen
groups consisting of 58 performers had a ball.
The standing-room-only crowd was equally en-
thusiastic (as evidenced when they spontaneous-
ly joined in on the Executive Committee’s ver-
sion of ‘‘You’ve Lost that Lovin Feelin’ ”’).

On behalf of those afflicted with this crippling
disease, thanks go to the committee members
who contributed their time for the past six
weeks, to the performers who were the highlight
of the evening and to the members of the aud-

ience who gave their zealous support. We will
definitely be doing this again.

Course requirements outlined

Dear W&L students:

During registration for the Fall Term, ALL
300-level history courses, except History 375,
Chinese Civilization to 1800, will require permis-
sion of the instructor prior to enrollment.
BEGINNING MONDAY, MAY 4, ANY RISING
JUNIOR OR RISING SENIOR may obtain this
permission by visi i g the instructor’s office and
signing the instructor’s list. Some history in-
structors may accept selected rising sophomores
into a 300-level course; therefore, ALSO ON
MONDAY, MAY 4, rising sophomores may also
visit the instructor and sign up for the course.
Regardless of which day you are supposed to
register, signing up for the course on MONDAY,
will reserve space for you in the course. It is
essential, however, that a student get his name
on the instructor’s list; therefore, please visit the
instructor in his office; please DO NOT stop the
instructor on the campus since he may forget a
student’s name before he can put it on the list.

For most courses, the purpose of requiring
permission is to limit the size of the class. The
History Department regrets the necessity for
this; we are willing, indeed, eager to teach as
many students in a class as can profit from that
experience but, in view of the damage to teach-
ing and learning that occurs from excessively
large classes, we simply must impose some
restriction on our enrollments.

Students interested in History 364 — European
Intellectual History from Renaissance to Kant
(Jarrett) or History 367 The Growth of Imperial
Russia (Bidlack) should see Professor McAhren.

sincerely yours,
Robert W. McAhren
Acting Head of Department

Discrimination protested

To the Editors:

When I first read the headline it seemed too
unreal to be true, and definitely worse than any
Soviet propaganda ploy I had ever heard of in my
life. “Employers may promote women and
minorities ahead of white males—without evi-
dence of prior discrimination.’’ Legalized
discrimination is what I call it. Yousee, lamina
real predicament. I am a white male about to
graduate from college and seek employment in
this great country of ours, where all men and
women are created equal, and where no one is to
be judged based solely on race, sex, or religion.
The problem is that these presumptions of
equality have just been overruled by the
Supreme Court. Incredible to think that such an
injustice could occur in this nation.

Or is it? Discrimination is nothing new in this
country, but legalized discrimination is. I read
the other day that women were still only making
about 70% of what men were for the same job.
This too is an injustice. I also see where blacks
are being discriminated against as they have
been in the past. This too is an injustice. And now
the Supreme Court has decided to try and right
these injustices with one of their own. Legalized
discrimination against white males is the
greatest injustice of all. Not because it is against
my gender and race, but because it is an abuse of
the law against a huge minority of this country.

The answer to the problem is quite clear and
simple. It has been around for over 200 years. All
men are created equal and cannot be judged
solely on race, sex, or religion. When this
sentence says ‘‘all men,”’ I translate that as
meaning all homosapiens, women included. In
other words — Equal pay for equal work, and no
discrimination against any man or woman,

Where there is discrimination, it should be
treated justly by the law. It seems so simple an
answer to such a volatile problem, but perhaps
those in the Supreme Court are so used to mak-
ing a rather simple problem quite complex that
they felt it only natural to right a wrong with
another wrong. My congratulations to you
members of this elite legal system, who have

Student life surveys needed
To the Editors:

A final decision will be made in the upcoming
weeks based on the Student Life Survey which
was distributed to all W&L women in early
March. This survey dealt with the possibility of
sororities, a women’s center of some type, or the
combination of both being established on cam-

pus.

Not enough women have responded to the
survey to draw any conclusions or to make any
final decisions based on a majority of the
women’s requests.

I think it is important for all W&L women to
realize that a decision of this magnitude can not
be made effectively without their response. A
final decision about the sorority/women’s center
question will be made soon after May 4. This
decision will ultimately affect the development
and progression of women on campus. Now is the
time to speak out about what you, as W&L
women want to see happen during your 4 years
on campus. It does no good to voice an opinion or
file a complaint after the final decision has been
made. I urge you to turn in your surveys to Carol
Calkins’ office in the University Center by Fri-
day, May 8.

Additional copies of the survey are available in
her office.

Your response can make a difference. Please
speak out and voice your opinion. This is our last
chance!

Circumcision opinions sought
Dear Editor:

We are a non-profit resource center organized
in 1986 by physicians, nurses and parents to pro-
vide up-to-date information on circumcision,
America’s unique and leading unnecessary
surgery.

The U.S. is now the only Western or Eastern
nation left in which over half of baby boys are
still circumcised at birth without a medical or
religious reason. Over 85 percent of the world’s
males are intact (non-circumcised).

In recent months we have received many let-
ters from American males who are dissatisfied
with their circumcisions and who have sought
medical advice from us on foreskin restoration.
The problems range from surgical scars to tight-
ness and pain to sexual dysfunction because of
the loss of the protective foreskin.

Because these problems may be more wide-
spread than previously thought, we are soliciting
letters from your readers, either signed or
anonymously, on the issue of circumcision. All
responses will be held in the strictest medical
confidence. Specifically, we ask: (1) describe
problems which you believe are related to the
fact that you are circumcised; (2) how old were
you when you learned you had been circumcis-
ed; (3) how did you feel when you realized that
part of your body was cut off; and (4) would you
prefer to be intact and would you consider fore-
skin restoration if available to you? We also
solicit comments from intact males and females.

This subject is sensitive and serious. Crank let-
ters are not appreciated. Your responses should
be sent to N.O.C.I.R.C., 731 Sir Francis Drake
Boulevard, San Anselmo, California 94960.
Readers interested in learning more about cir-
cumcision should send a stamped, self-address-
ed envelope to that address.

Sincerely,
Marilyn F. Milos, R.N.
Director

26 cadets honored in ceremony

Te
Rush: put it off

for a while

By Steven Pockrass

One day, a large white sign with big black letters was posted in the

orphanage:

ORPHANS, TAKE NOTE! FOR THE NEXT TWO WEEKS, EACH
OF YOU WILL BE INTRODUCED TO A DOZEN FAMILIES WHO

WILL WINE YOU AND DINE YOU AND HAVE ALL SORTS OF PAR-
TIES IN YOUR HONOR. IF ONE OF THESE FAMILIES DECIDES

* THAT IT WANTS YOU AS A SON OR DAUGHTER, YOU WILL HAVE
, ONE WEEK TO SAY “YES” OR “‘NO.”’

No, it’s not a true story. But it’s not much worse than the truth 2f

‘ Washington and Lee’s current fraternity Rush system.
, | W&L needs a deferred Rush. About the only thing that’s forced upon
freshmen faster and more furiously than Rush is that silly algebra test
* that’s used to place students in beginning or advanced calculus.
Many members of the W&L community, from freshmen to faculty,
are in favor of a deferred Rush, a concept I suggest the Interfraternity
* Council and Student Affairs Committee consider for next year. I'd like
_ tocite five major reasons to support this position.

First, instead of having rules that are passed in the spring and
forgotten (or ignored) by September, the rules could be passed during
, the Fall Term. This would end a lot of confusion.

Second, Rush would be more fair, giving smaller houses (such as my
r own) a better chance to compete with the larger, more wealthy
, houses. Students would have a chance to see all of the houses at a more

leisurely pace and would be able to make much wiser choices about
:* which houses to visit once Rush actually begins. Thus, Rush would

, become more efficient.

Third, we would better allocate our social resources. How much
‘* money do we waste on 17 band parties on a single weekend in
, , September, only to have bandless parties in October and November?
How much do we spend on those first-impression bashes the first week
'* of school, only to become bashless in January?

', Fourth, freshmen would have the chance to explore other social and
extra-curricular opportunities before joining fraternities. Can an
:* educational institution truly claim to have its priorities straight or to
, mold the entire individual when its first role of business is to pressure

" people into time-consuming, four-year social commitments?
Fifth, the freshman year would become much easier and more
, rewarding. Should our first “schoolwide activity’’ of the year be one
- that for the most part excludes women? Should it be one that im-
-’ mediately labels some students as “‘social misfits’? Should it be one
:, that forces some students to be pledges (i.e., scum) for six or eight

‘ months of their freshman year?

A deferred Rush probably should have been instituted here long ago,
| «but what is most important is that we push for it now. After all, what

, are we afraid of?

' Are we scared that fraternities will be unable to live within their
'. budgets for the first six months without pledge dues? Are we scared
_that the frat system will lose its campus dominance if freshmen are
given the chance to make friends on their own and find other ways to
' spend their time? Are we scared that frats may have to adapt toa new
: system or that freshmen will think more carefully about where to join
' when they have a more informed opinion about each of the houses?
:* Ifo, then we should bag the fraternity system.

influence of some good black musi-

be in the top 92.

These black artists were not in-

considered influential at the time
they were recorded. ‘‘It’s a shame,
but that’s the way our society’s
been,”’ Pierce said.

Although the Rolling Stones special

recorded some of the countdown, in-

From Staff Reports

 

John T. Wiltse, a Washington and
Lee senior from Bradford, N.H., is
one of 20 cadets nationwide to receive
the National Defense Transportation
Award,

Wiltse received the award at the
Army ROTC President’s Awards
Day Ceremony in Lee Chapel on
Tuesday when W&L President John
D. Wilson recognized Wiltse and 26
other cadets.

The award is given to a cadet who
is in the top 25 percent of his class in
academic and ROTC subjects and
who is recommended by both Luke B.
Ferguson, professor of Military
science, and John W. Elrod, dean of
the college, as an outstanding stu-
dent.

Paul G. Schlimm, a senior from
Baltimore, was awarded the univer-
sity saber as he received the
Washington and Lee Outstanding
Cadet Award. Schlimm was elected
by his peers for his exceptional
Jeadership ability, devotion to duty
and outstanding service to the
University’s Corps of Cadets.

The Major Ronald 0. Scharnberg
Memorial Award, recognizing the
cadet who most nearly typifies the
W&L tradition of the citizen-scholar-
soldier, was presented to senior An-
drew M. Gibson from Atlanta. The
award is a memorial to Major
Ronald Oliver Scharnberg, a 1963
W&L graduate who was killed in ac-
tion.

Senior Matthew J. Waterbury from
St. Petersburg Beach, Fla., received
the George C. Marshall ROTC Award
for demonstrating leadership and
scholastic qualities which epitomized
the career of Gen. Marshall.

Other awards presented to
members of W&L’s ROTC unit were:

been named associate dean of
students and director of career ser-
vices at Washington and Lee.

The announcement was made by
Lewis G. John, dean of students at
W&L. Heatley will assume his post
July 1.

As director of career services,
Heatley will provide leadership for

would lead the countdown.

“The number one song is probably
unexpected,” although “it was a
number one hit at one time,”’ Pierce
said. “It registered really big on in-
fluence and requests, It’s “the type
of tune everyone’s gonna like.”’

Pierce did say that his top pick was
not a Rolling Stones’ song, which
may come as a surprise to those who
know him well.

But considering that he worked
about six hours on the Rolling Stones
special before putting in about 20 on
the countdown, perhaps it’s no sur-
prise at all.

flute and three different drums,
among which is included the shoulder
drum (or ‘‘Kotsuzumi’’), believed to
be the only type of drum in the world
that is struck from the bottom by the
performer.

Controlling the musical direction of
the performance is frequently the
responsibility of the performer of the
Otsuzumi, or hip drum, as there is no
conductor in Noh.

Noh differs from contemporary
Western theatre in other ways as
well. Professional Noh performers do
not receive diplomas or papers at-
testing to their skill in Noh Theatre.
Instead, Noh performance skills are
passed down from father to son in a
line unbroken since the 15th century
in what is known as the “Iemoto”’
system.

The only other way to become a
professional performer is to spend
many years living with and learning
from a headmaster of a Noh school of
a family of Noh.

And unlike the Western traditicn of
performance dress rehearsals, Noh
performers train and rehearse on
their own, and there is only a brief
meeting a few days fore the actual

performance to review details.

“The six professional performers
in Tsuxma are noted in Japan for
presenting traditional Noh Theatre in
non-traditional surroundings as a
way of introducing the theatre tradi-
tion to wider audiences,’ Rogers
said.

The traditional Noh stage should
prove an interesting complement to
the Lime Kiln’s outdoor theatre when
the group performs there 8 p.m
Saturday night. It consists of a raised
square platform that reaches out into
the audience. There are posts at each
corner that support a peaked thatch-
ed roof

The only stage decor is three small
pine trees along a bridgeway that is
used for exits and entrances, and a
painting of a large pine tree on the
upstage wall.

The troupe’s lecture/demonstra-
tion at 8 p.m. Sunday in Lee Chapel
will include ‘‘scenes’’ from the Satur-
day performance, as well as explana
tions of many of the symbols used.

“Those unfamiliar with Noh
Theatre or the Japanese tradition
will find that Noh cannot be defined
by our normal conceptions of time
and space,’’ Rogers said. ‘In attemp-
ting to bring out one’s deeper con-
sciousness, Noh uses fantasy in a
way that often defies common sense.
This denial of logic is often hard for
Westerners to grasp.’

Generals comeback
falls short in 2nd OT

DAVID EMRICH
ris Editor

 

Except for two minutes, the
Washington and Lee lacrosse team
would like to forget all of last week.

The Generals dropped a 15-14 dou-
ble overtime game to Roanoke that

ost them the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference Championship. They also
dropped a 12-9 decision to Washing-
ton College that cost them their No. 1
ranking. But the final two minutes of
regulation play in yesterday’s ODAC
title game against Roanoke took
some of the rough edge off the week.

To be honest, W&L had no right to
even be in a position to win yester-
day’s game. The Maroons outplayed
the Generals for all but the last 1:51
of regulation.

Those last few seconds, however,
made all the difference in the world
in terms of the game, and might have
even been important in terms of a na-
tional tournament bid.

The Generals were ranked first by
the United States Intercollegiate
Lacrosse Association as late as last
Saturday. Then the loss to
Washington College dropped them
from that spot. That loss, combined
with the lackluster performance they
were turning in against Roanoke,
might have cost them their bid to the
National Collegiate Athletic Associa-
tion’s post season tournament. After
all, with the exception of Ohio-
Wesleyan, the Generals hadn’t really
played any top-ranked teams. Then
when they finally did face tourna-
ment teams, they played two unim-
pressive games.

Roanoke’s defense was having an
xcellent day against the Generals.
rhey were keeping W&L’s two main
offensive weapons, sophomores John
Ware and Neill Redfern, in check.
"hey were forcing the Generals to
ake bad shots and harrassing W&L
s soon as they got the ball.

Meanwhile, on the offensive end,
the Maroons were also controlling
the tempo of the game. Roanoke had
possession for the great majority of
the first half, and led 8-4 at intermis-

sion,

W&L appeared ready to mount
runs at the Maroons on several occa-
sions, but in each instance Roanoke
would score to squelch any chance of
a comeback.

That’s why, when the Generals
were down 14-10 with under two
minutes to go, the fans started filing

out of the stadium. However, Ware
brought most of those fans back with
two quick goals.

Ware scored, unassisted, from the
left side of the goal, to bring the
Generals to within three, 14-11.

Ware then scored again, from the
same spot, exactly one minute later
to make the score 14-12.

At this point, everybody in the
stadium was on their feet. The
Generals had scored twice in one
minute. Suddenly the game didn’t
seem out of reach.

“The kids started to believe in
themselves, it was tremendous. It
was great to come back,”’ said W&L
head coach Dennis Daly

Junior Sandy Harrison won the en-
suing faceoff, and W&L got the ball to
their second leading scorer, Redfern,
who went in on the goal, untouched,
and scored with 31 seconds remain-
ing in the game to cut the Roanoke
lead to one, 14-13.

Roanoke suddenly wasn’t doing the
things they had kept them in control
of the game earlier. They didn’t seem
to be as aggressive defensively.

The Generals took advantage of
Roanoke’s loss of concentration, and
won the next faceoff. Ware then took
a shot that dribbled wide and out of
bounds. It was still W&L’s ball with
11 seconds left.

Senior Bill Garrett handled the in-
bounds and passed the ball to Robbie
Stanton who took a shot from 30 feet
that bounced right past the Roanoke
goalie and tied the score with 0:08
showing on the clock.

The Generals had scored four
times with less than two minutes
remaining to tie the score. With 1:51
of excellence they had almost erased
the 58:09 of mediocrity.

“We got the ball to our shooters,”’
said Daly. ‘We were working,
screening well. I thought we had all
the momentum in the world.”

The teams then went into the first
four-minute sudden death overtime
period.

The Generals had two excellent op-
portunities to win the game, but
came up short both times. Once
because of a great defensive play by
Roanoke, and once because of plain
bad luck.

In their first opportunity, the
Generals had Redfern behind the
defense, all alone, breaking in on the
goal. All they had to do was get the

Men’s tennis sweeps every flight

 

By MIKE SHADY
Assistant Sports Editor

 

The perfect scenario would have
been for the Washington and Lee
men’s tennis team to capture its third
consecutive Old Dominion Athletic
Conference championship by win-
ning a tie-breaker in the third set of
the final and decisive doubles match.
Well, it didn’t quite happen that way.

Instead, the Generals, still ranked
No. 2 in the nation by the ITCA Divi-
sion III poll, won all 27 matches in
breezing through the ODAC’s nine
flights (six singles and three
doubles); had their No. 1 singles
player, sophomore Robert Haley,
named ODAC Player-of-the-Year;
and had their head coach, Gary
Franke, awarded ODAC Coach-of-
the-Year.

All of this was accomplished
without the services of W&L’s No. 2
singles player, sophomore Bobby
Matthews, who was unable to play
due to an injury to his right hand.

‘We pulled Matthews,’ said
Franke, ‘‘because his hand was still

sore,

Matthews’ spot was filled by
freshman Matt Ormiston, who
played No. 6 singles and No. 1
doubles with junior David McLeod.

According to Franke, Ormiston’s
performance was nothing short of ex-
cellent.

“| was pleased with the way he

iyed. In his first match, he was

e to hold off three match points
before he won 7-6 in the third set.
Then he got on track [for the re-

mainder of the tournament]. He also
performed well with McLeod.”

The winners for W&L were: Haley
at No. 1 singles; McLeod at No. 2;
senior captain Roby Mize at No. 3;
junior Chris Wiman at No. 4; fresh-
man John Morris at No. 5; and Or-
miston at No. 6. The winning doubles
teams were: Ormiston and McLeod
at No. 1; Haley and Mize at No. 2;
and Morris and Wiman at No. 3.

It was the first time that W&L has
ever swept all nine flights in the
ODACs, and Franke called it a
“great achievement and team ef-
fort.” It was also the third con-
secutive year in which Franke was
named the conference’s Coach-of-the
Year.
ginia match cancelled, the Generals
will now continue to practice in an-
ticipation of receiving an invitation
to the NCAA Division III National
Championships, to be held May 11-17
in Salisbury, Md. The selections will
be made on Sunday night. The Gen-
erals have participated in the cham-
pionship tournament the past two

years, finishing 8th when it was held
at W&L in 1985, and ending up in 2nd
place in 1986 after losing in the final
match to Kalamazoo, Mich.

Franke sees the top four spots
secure with No. 1-ranked Kalamazoo,
W&L, No. 3-ranked UC-Santa Cruz
and No. 4-ranked Washington College
all assured of receiving bids. The bot-
tom four spots, however, are still in
question, with Principia, Redlands,
Claremont, Rochester, Whitman,
Gustavus Adolphus and Swathmore
all still in the hunt, said Franke.

VOLLEYS...Matthews started hit-
ting this week and, according to
Franke, his injury is a “day-to-day
thing” and only ‘‘a matter of time’
before it is totally healed. Franke
was optimistic that Matthews was
going to be ready for nationals... The
Generals will play Hampton Institute
in a match on May 7. Hampton is
ranked No. 2 in Division II and, like
W&L, is in preparation for its na-
tional tournament.

Track team tramples
ODAC competition

 

By JIM LAKE
Staff Reporter

 

The members of the Washington
and Lee track team have apparently
decided that they like blowouts. Hav-
ing routed the competition in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference Indoor
Championship Meet in February,
they graced the ODAC with a repeat
performance in Saturday’s outdoor
title meet at Bridgewater College.
The Generals crushed the rest of the
conference, easily out distancing
runners-up Roanoke and _ Bridge-
water by a 55-point margin.

W&L took at least one of the top
four places in every event but one,
sand took at least two of the top six
places in eight events. The Generals
won nine of the day’s 17 events, in-
cluding six of the 10 running events,
where the Generals ‘‘really
dominated”’ the rest of the con-
ference, according to head coach
Norris Aldridge.

The weather for the conference
championship was not a major pro-
blem for W&L, although Aldridge
said the cold and wet conditions at
Bridgewater did affect the times in
the sprint events and may have
hindered performances elsewhere,
particularly for the other schools.
‘“‘We were mentally prepared for the
weather, and really didn’t let it
bother us,”’ said Aldridge.

W&L was led by junior Andrew
White, who won the 110-meter high
hurdles in 15.2 seconds, won the 400-
meter hurdles in 57.1 seconds, ran on
the winning 1600-meter relay team,
and was named ODAC Runner-of-
the-Year by the conference coaches,
the same award he received in indoor
track.

Freshman Wes Boyd had “an ex-
cellent day,” said Aldridge. Boyd
took first place in the 100 (11.2
seconds) and 200 (22.9 seconds)
meter runs. Boyd also took third in
the long jump, even though he was a
last-minute entry in that event as a
replacement for injured senior John
Burlingame, and ran on W&L’s gold-
medal winning 1600-meter relay
squad.

In the shot put, senior Tom Murray
took the conference title with a throw
of 49 feet, setting a new ODAC out-
door record to go along with his in-
door record in the same event.

W&L distance runners also had an
excellent meet, according to

Aldridge. Junior Richard Moore took
first in the 1500-meter run (4:05.9)
and was third in the 5000-meter rur
(15:36.3), and sophomore Jamie Urso
finished second in the 800 with a time
of 1:55.6, a new personal best and just
four-tenths of a second behind Roa-
noke’s Robbie Anderson.

In the pole vault, W&L took three of
the top six places and scored 20
points, with seniors John Carder and
Matthew Steilberg finishing first and
second and junior Joseph Fisher tak-
ing fifth. Carder cleared 13’6’’, with
Steilberg finishing at 13 feet and
Fisher at 12 feet.

The Generals also took two of the
top four places in the high jump.
Sophomore Fray McCormick over-
came knee trouble and a wet runway
to win the conference championship
in that event, clearing 6’2’’, and
Steilberg was second at 6’0”’.

W&L’s 1600-meter relay team of
Urso, Boyd, Andrew White, and
junior John White came from behind
to win the conference title, finishing
in 3:28.4. W&L took second place in
the 400-meter relay with a time of
43.9 seconds, just one-tenth of a sec-
ond off of the pace set by
Bridgewater.

MILEPOSTS... The team totals for
the meet were as follows: W&L, 157,
Roanoke, 102; Bridgewater, 102:
Lynchburg, 78; Emory & Henry, 49;
Eastern Mennonite, 37. These scores
are very similar to those of the indoor,
championship meet, which W&L won
by 48-point margin... The 55-point
margin of victory was the largest
spread in the ODAC Outdoor Cham-
pionship Meet since 1983, when
Lynchburg defeated runner-up
Roanoke by 69 points... A tribute to
this year’s seniors: In the past four
years, W&L has never lost a regulan
outdoor season meet, compiling a
27-0 record, and has placed no lower
than second in an ODAC Champion-
ship meet, winning two of those four
contests... Aldridge was named the
1987 ODAC Outdoor Track Coach-of-
the-Year after Saturday’s meet; ‘in
February, he received the same
award for his indoor team’s perfor-
mance... The season continues for,
several W&L athletes at this
weekend’s James Madison Universi*
ty Invitational. This meet and the.
Virginia Invitational on May 9 will
give Murray, Boyd, Moore, Urso, and
several others two more chances to
qualify for the NCAA Division III Na-
tional Championships.

Like any other sports team, the
Washington and Lee baseball squad
was hoping to close out its regular
season with a couple of wins, in order
to keep team morale high during
tournament time. Unfortunately, this
was not the case for the Generals this

?
year.

«

Yesterday, in the opening round of
the Old Dominion Athletic Confernce
tournament, the Generals were
eliminated by a 7-4 score by
Bridgewater. The General’s record
fell to 6-16, 4-11 in the conference.

The Eagles led by one run, 5-4, in
the seventh inning. They then scored
two more to clinch the victory.

“A couple of early errors hurt us in
the ballgame,” said W&L head coach

_ Jeff Stickley. He said that the good

" pitching was held back by fielding er-

 

rors,

When asked how he could
decrease the number of errors,
Stickley said, ‘In such a short
season, we only have a few things we
can work on.”’

After losing to the Bridgewater
Eagles on Thursday, Apri! 23, the
Generals ended their Old Dominion
Athletic Conference season with a
record of 4-10. Their overall record
fell to 6-14 with that loss.

Bridgewater ‘ook control of the
game early, getting six runs in the
top of the first inning. Many of these
runs came off of fielding errors by
the Generals, who could only manage
one run in the entire game. The
Eagles, however, got eight more
runs, to make the final 14-1.

Junior Carter Steuart, who has
been pitching well in these last few
weeks of the season, gave up only
three earned runs in the game.

The Generals, who went 1-3 for the

5th-place finish for women

Finishing up their second season,
the Washington and Lee women’s
tennis team road tripped to Sweet-

.. briar College this past weekend and
. took fifth place in the Old Dominion

Athletic Conference Championships.
Although there were some mixed

,. emotions before the ODAC cham-

pionship, it was generally agreed

*. that the team had made great strides
~ Since their first season. Entering into
- the tournament with a 5-3 record,
“ there was hope that the team could

finish as high as second.
The Generals, however, ended up

«in fifth place but were still hap-
» py with their performance. There

-was a tie for third and fourth, and the

“team was a scant four points from
» finishing second.

far as the semi-finals of the tourna-

+. ment. They were Valerie Pierson at

' Roanoke’s Charlie Walker made an
* excellent play to knock the pass down
, and keep the ball from Redfern.

In the second opportunity, the

“Generals asked for a timeout and
4 called a set play. According to Daly,

the Generals first option was not
so W&L waited. When senior

« Bil? Garavente managed to sneak in

behind the defense, the Generals got

"the ball to him and he took a shot

*from point-blank range. The ‘shot
, beat the Roanoke goalie but, unfor-
tunately for the Generals, bounced

* off the crossbar and back into play.

. Nogoal.

“We got the play we wanted,” said
* Daly. “It [the shot] just hit the pipe.”’
. Roanoke started the second over-

time with possession because they
‘held the ball at the end of the first
» overtime, They immediately passed
out front and took a shot that beat
* senior W&L goaltender John Church
» along the ground. Roanoke won the
game, and their seventh consecutive
“ODAC championship, 15-14, just
* seven seconds into the second four-
minute overtime.

“T’d like to thank the fans for com-
«ing out to support us,” said Daly.
, “They were tremendous. It meant a

lot to the players to get applause
* from the fans even though we come
, up a goal short.”

* Last Saturday, the Generals took a

, very costly trip to Chestertown, Md.
Not only did the Generals lose, but

* they also dropped from first to third

, in the USILA Division III lacrosse
poll.

The Sho’men of Washington Col-
* lege ‘came out hungry” according to
» Daly, and blitzed the Generals for
three quick goals. W&L managed to
* score once to make it 3-1, but then the
, Sho’men rattled off five straight
goals to make the score 8-1 early in

’ the second quarter.

+

“T guess we are just used to start-
, ing at 2:00 [the game started at

1:30],”’ joked Daly of the team’s slow
" start.

W&L then scored five straight to
make the score 8-6 at the half, but the
” team never got any closer.
“Tt was a situation where they got
seme momentum, and then they
started to take off,”’ said Daly.

As far as the national playofts go,
‘the final selections and sites will be
announced on Sunday. It is a safe bet
“that, after yesterday’s game, both
» W&L and Roanoke will be included in
the field.

As expected, W&L had to play
Emory and Henry many times. Un-
fortunately, they had to face the
eventual ODAC champions earlier
than they had hoped.

“We did seem to run into Emory
and Henry quite a bit,’”’ said W&L
head coach Bill Washburn. ‘We also
ran in to Randolph-Macon Ashland a
good bit.”’

R-M Ashland finished very closely
behind E&H and presented more pro-
blems for the Generals.

Reiterating the strength of E&H’s
team, Christian said, ‘‘Every time
we won a big match we would have to
play Emory and Henry in the next
round.”” The most disappointing
aspect of the tournament seemed to
be W&L’s inability to steer clear of
E&H in the early rounds.

The tournament, as well as the
season, however, were regarded pro-
udly by the team. This was only the
Generals second season, and they
made tremendous strides by posting
a winning record as well as
fifth place in the conference tourna-
ment. Said Christian,’ ‘‘Last year we
were in ninth, and this is only our se-
cond year and we came in fifth.”

week, took what Stickley called ‘‘the
hardest loss of the season”’ from the
Eastern Mennonite Royals.

The Generals trailed 7-1 after three
innings, but managed to rally back,
scoring nine runs during the last four
innings of the game.

With two out in the bottom of the
ninth inning, the Royals blasted a
three-run homer to tie the game, sen-
ding the teams to extra innings.

A run in the eleventh inning once
again put the Generals on top, and
soon they were again only one out
away from the win. The Royals
scored two in their at-bats, however,
to snatch away the victory, 12-11.

Extra-inning heart-breakers have
played an unenjoyably big role in the
Generals’ season, and they will need
to improve in this area in order to be
a winning team. The best asset to
have is experience, and the Generals,
who lose only a handful of seniors,
will probably be winning more of
those close games next season.

‘Baseball and golf turn in disappointing performances

Bridgewater eases by Generals, 7-4

 

Gammage grabs all-ODAC honors

 

By MIKE SHADY
Assistant Sports Editor

 

There is nothing that can replace
actual competition. Practice can be
made to simulate real-game situa-
tions, but it doesn’t come close to be-
ing a substitute for the pressure one
faces in the heat of battle. For the
Washington and Lee golf team, this
fact was never more evident than in
the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference championship at the
Roanoke Countryside Club on Mon-
day and Tuesday.

Trailing by only two strokes after
the first round, the Generals wilted
on the second day of play and finish-
ed a disappointing fifth out of the six
teams competing. W&L’s two-round
total of 654 was a full 12 strokes
behind winner Lynchburg’s score of
642.

“That was only our ninth com-

petitive round this season,” said
head coach Buck Leslie. ‘‘That’s a
minus for us. These other teams have
played 18 to 20 rounds.

“It’s no excuse. We could have
played all those rounds and still
came out and shot the way we did,
but it put us ata disadvantage.”

“When you don’t play this game
often enough, you can’t expect to be
consistent.’’

Consistent was how junior co-
captain Chip Gist was playing before
spring break. Gist was the lowest
scorer in ODAC play heading into the
final ODAC regular season match.
Gist shot an uncharacteristic 88 in
that tournament and backed that per-
formance up with a just as sluggish
168 total (85-83) in the championship.

“Chip was a lock for NCAA’s [the
national Division ITI tournament] go-

ing into the break,”’ said Leslie. ‘He
led the ODAC in scoring and then he
just never got it back.”

The Generals did get an outstand-
ing performance from junior John
Gammage, who carded a 157 (78-79),
good enough to earn him all-ODAC
honors.

“John has an outside chance to go
to Nationals,” said Leslie. ‘‘His last
three outings have been very good.
He played very well.”’

Other scorers for the Generals
were junior Gary Campbell with a
163 (78-85) and sophomore Pete Cole-
man with a 167 (80-87). Paul DiPaolo
of Lynchburg was the medalist with a
149 (75-74).

Roanoke finished second in the
team standings, while Hampden-
Sydney and Randolph-Macon tied for
third. Bridgewater ended up in last
place, some 48 strokes off the pace.

Freshman Wes Boyd has been
named Washington & Lee’s Athlete of
the Week for his performance at
Saturday’s ODAC Track Champion-
ships.

Boyd won the 100-and 200-meter
dashes and ran the third leg of the
first place mile-relay team on his
way to helping the Generals win the
championship by 55 points.

He also took third in the long jump

and helped the 400-meter relay team
place second.

His performance in the 100 and 200
also kept him undefeated in the
ODAC for the two events.

“] thought I ran really well con-
sidering the weather conditions dur-
ing the meet,” said Boyd.

“T also felt the whole team had a
clutch performance that enabled us
to win the championship.”

By placing first in the 100 and 200
Boyd has a chance to compete at

qualifying meets for the Division III
championships. The meets are held
in the next two weeks at James
Madison and UVa.

Boyd’s time in the 100 was 11.2 and
he feels that if he has a good start and
the weather is nice he could make the
National qualifying time.

“I think I have a better shot at
making the Nationals in the 100 but I
could also make it in the 200; it all
depends on my start,” said Boyd.

Boyd didn’t just run track for the
Generals this year. He also played
guard on the basketball team.

“T started running track in junior
high school and was also playing
basketball. In high school I gave up
track to concentrate on basketball,”
said Boyd.

In his senior year in high school,
the track coach asked Boyd to come
out and run for the team and he did.

Boyd said that he came to W&L as
a basketball recruit but also talked to
track coach Norris Aldridge. This
made him decide to compete in both
sports at the collegiate level.

U2 ready to

conquer world

By CHARLIE GAY
Record Critic

 

“The Joshua Tree,’’ U2’s follow-up

to 1984’s commercially successful but
artistically disappointing ‘‘The Un
orgettable Fire,’ is a_ brilliantly
evocative album that atones for the
failures of its predecessor. Although
this cut, the band’s second venture
into the studio with producer Brian
Eno, is much in the same polished
style as ‘The Forgettable Album”’, in
contrast, “‘The Joshua Tree’’ does
not choose to drown out guitars with
swirling keyboards in the tradition of
‘“Promenade’.”’ Essentially, U2’s
atest release is ‘‘The Unforgettable
ire’ with testosterone.

At first listen, the album’s initial
track ‘Where the Streets Have No
Name’’ may send shivers down your
spine — it recalls one of ‘‘The Forget-

table Album’s’’ most abysmal
failures, ‘“‘MLK’’, with its opening
notes. The song soon evolves,
however, into a _ hopeful tune

highlighted the Edge’s pulsing, fu-
sion guitar work. The balance of the
first side is equally impressive. ‘I
Still Haven’t Found What I’m Look-
ing For’ and the current hit single
“With Or Without You”’ are much in
the same, emotionally evocative
vein. “With Or Without You” might
also scare at first earful, as it sounds
like it lacks the necessary
testosterone content early on. By the
climax of the song, however, the
edge’s slashing guitar is in full force,
meshing perfectly with the rhythm
section of bassist Adam Clayton and
drummer Larry Mullen Jr. “Exit” is
another fine melody off the second
side.

Despite these steller tunes, the
masterpiece of ‘‘The Joshua Tree”’ is
undoubtedly ‘Bullet The Blue Sky,”
which marks a momentary return to
U2’s raw early days. Here the Edge’s

biting guitar work is reminiscent of
that off “Boy's” classic “Electric
Co.’’ But the standout feature of the
cut, as well as most of the album, is

U2’s ‘‘The Joshua Tree”’

sono’s breathtaking vocals. They
are, in turn, emotional, firey,
sincere, and hopeful. They are also
probably his finest album perfor-
mance to date.

In sum, “The Joshua Tree” suc-
ceeds in the same country that ‘“The
Unforgettable Fire” failed in — it is

Roger and Eric come home

By MICHAEL TUGGLE
Entertainment Editor

 

lhe chapel was quiet, a little
solemn maybe. The stage lights
criss-crossed onto the stage, illum
nating the solitary pair of stools sit-
ing there. Shadows from the lights
sat on the walls as if waiting for
omeone to come home.

Slowly, people, friends trickled into
the chapel pews and, like the
shadows, waited for someone to

ome home. It would not be a world-
class pianist, or an international
orass ensemble, or a winner of the

chaikovsky competition — No, not
ionight. Only family could ever come
‘ome to the hallowed chapel.

Just as I looked down to check the
ume, a single clap came from some-
one in one of the back pews, followed
by another, and another, and
another. Two men dressed in tuxedos

approached; guitars in hand. As the
clapping subsided, the two caught
each other’s eye, breathed in, and
sang.

“Amazing Grace, how sweet the
sound...’ cut into the silence as the
sweet a capella melody rolled over
the chapel gathering. “I once was
lost, but now am found. Was blind,
but now I see.”

Silence filled the chapel as the final
notes floated into the pews, and Eric
Heinsohn and Roger Day grinned as
if tosay, ‘“‘Isn’t it great to be home.”’

In the coming years there will be
more grins, and more ‘‘thank you’
nods of the head, just as there were
tonight. Yet it is questionable
whether or not Heinsohn and Day will
ever give a performance that is any
better, or more memorable than
Monday night’s; their first in Lee
Chapel.

As “Jenny” started things running,
it was obvious that everyone present

was in store for a truly special even-
ing of music. ‘‘Alabama in the Morn-
ing,” ‘‘After the Snowfall’, “Along
the Road,” and the other twelve
original compositions were so good,
and so reminiscent of Jim Croce,
Harry Chapin, James Taylor, and
Simon and Garfunkel that one
wonders why Heinsohn and Day are
not already signed to a major record-
ing label.

They played together beautifully,
each following the other’s lead, and
then they broke, each one playing a
solo section to showcase hits in-
dividual talent. Day’s ‘“‘Goodbye to
the Game” was only overshadowed
by his instrumental on guitar, while
Heinsohn’s exceptional Mississippi
Blues composition using both guitar
and harmonica left no doubts about
his ability to handle a guitar.

As the duo finished up ‘‘Mudpack,”’

woman, the glances and the smiles

Police Academy bombs

By MICHAEL TUGGLE
Movie Critic

 

When I saw Emilio Estevez’s
Wisdom in the fall, | was almost sure
that it would be the worst film of the
year. It was poorly written, poorly
acted, and the Rambo-Robin Hood-
Bonnie and Clyde premise of saving
the poor by blowing up mortgages at
banks across the country was in-
credibly sophomoric. If you are ques-
tioning how I could call Wisdom the
worst film of the year, then ponder no
longer because there is one that’s
worse

Police Academy 4 in all truth should
never have been released. It is by far
cand after Wisdom, Shanghai Sur-
prise, and Howard the Duck this is

saying a lot) the worst film of the
year and an embarrassment to any-
one associated with it.

The first Police Academy was
relatively funny. Steven Guttenberg
stole the show as the screwed up
Mahoney, but the supporting cast of
David Graf (Tackleberry), Michael
Winslow (Jones), and Leslie Easter-
brook (Callahan) put in solid back-up
performances to help make the film a
commercial success. Police Academy
2 was almost as bad as 4, but did in-
troduce Tim Kazurinsky and Bob
Goldthwait into the series.

The third film rivaled the first in
terms of being funny, but still seem-
ed to be missing something, and
didn’t reach the public like the first
one had. If Police Academy 3 was
missing something, then Police
Academy 4 is missing everything.

Guttenberg, who has been one of
the constant sources of humor in past
films, is scarcely in the frame. Tim
Kazurinsky, who was hilarious as
“Dr. Tim” on the ‘Saturday Night
Live’ newscast a few years ago, is
dull and totally lifeless. Bob
Goldthwait gives the only decent per-
formance in the film, yet even he
fails to display any of the comic
genius that we witnessed in his HBO
special, ‘Share the Warmth.” As for
the other characters, they belong on
the cutting room floor along with the
rest of this film.

There is absolutely nothing worth-
while to say aboutPolice Academy 4 .
It’s lifeless, it’s boring, it has ab-
solutely no plot, and it’s only an hour
and ten minutes long. If you go, you
deserve what you get.

they grinned, and bowed again as the
applause held them on the edge of the
stage. After two or three minutes, the
clapping and whistling finally subsid-
ed and Heinsohn and Day, Eric and
Roger, came down into the audience
to talk with their friends, professors,
and old classmates. Some of the
gathered listeners winded their way
around clumps of conversation, and
wandered out into the night air,
where quicker admirers were buying
Heinsohn and Day cassettes brought
down from the bookstore.

After twenty minutes or so, the
security guard flashed the lights
signaling everyone that it was time to
lock up. The evening of original com-
positions was over, but not really.
Roger and Eric started here and
they’ll soon return -for another visit
home. Maybe they’ll do a 4th of July
concert in Glen Maury Park — or is
that Central Park?

An ‘Early Bird Fun Run’ with
Coach Norman F. Lord and the ded-
ication of a portrait of Supreme Court
justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., a
graduate of Washington and Lee’s
undergraduate and law schools, are
among the many activities planned
for academic and law alumni classes
this Alumni Weekend.

Approximately 530 alumni from 10
reunion classes, beginning in 1937
and ending in 1982, are expected
throughout the next several days.

The weekend of partying, mingling
and more partying begins tonight at
8:15 p.m. in Lee Chapel with an open-
ing reunion assembly speech given
by Parke Rouse Jr., titled ‘Robert E.
Lee, Francis P. Gaines, and Herb the
Dog Man.”’

Rouse is a member of the Class of
1937 and currently a columnist for the
Newport News Daily Press. The
speech is open to the entire W&L
community.

On Friday at 10:00 a.m. on the
Front Lawn of Lewis Hall at the law
school, W&L graduate Lewis Powell
Jr. will be honored with the dedica-
tion of his portrait, which will hang

outside of the Moot Courtroom. More
than 400 people are expected at the
ceremony, including Justice Powell
and an entourage of family and
friends.

A half hour of music will follow at
1:30 that afternoon when the Glee
Club, University Chorus and
Southern Comfort perform on the
Front Campus in front of Lee Chapel.
From 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. tomorrow

now on to Ohio

 

By DAVID EMRICH
Sports Editor

The Roanoke Maroons won when it
counted, but the Washington and Lee
Generals won when it counted even
more.

Yesterday on Wilson Field, in the
opening round of the National Col-
legiate Athletic Association’s Divi-
sion III lacrosse tournament, the
Generals avenged last week’s dou-
ble-overtime loss to Roanoke, and
they did so in a resounding fashion.
The win advances the Generals to the
second round, where they will face
the Ohio Wesleyan Bishops this Sun-
day, May 10, at Ohio Wesleyan.

Last week, you recall, the Maroons
thwarted a big Generals comeback

when Roanoke’s Rich Paulik scored
just seven seconds into the second
overtime. That victory gave the
Maroons their seventh consecutive
Old Dominion Athletic Conference ti-
tle.

This week, however, was a dif-
ferent story. Thanks to strong second
half performances by senior goal-
tender John Church and the entire
Generals defense as well as
sophomore attacker Neill Redfern
and junior attacker Pete Smith, the
Generals easily handled the Maroons
by a 19-11 score.

Despite the lopsided final score,
the first half was very close, with the
Generals holding a slim 8-7 lead at
the intermission.

The game opened with the
Generals jumping off to the early
lead, piling up a 4-1 advantage
halfway through the first period

before the Maroons stormed back to
tie the game at four by the end of the
initial quarter.

“We didn’t get behind, and that
was important,” said W&L head
coach Dennis Daly. ‘‘In our last two
games [losses to Washington College
and Roanoke] we fell behind early.
Even though they tied it after we
jumped off to a lead, we weren't
behind, and that was a big dif-
ference.”

The Generals began the second
quarter in much the same fashion as
they did the first. W&L built an 8-4
lead, but again Roanoke stopped the
Generals momentum with three
goals and cut the halftime lead to a
slim 8-7,

It was in the second half, however,
that the Generals really started to

Convention is a ernque experience

 

From Staff Reports

 

Legislation that would prevent the
federal government from with-
holding appropriations from states
as a way of forcing those states to
comply with federal policy was ap-
proved Saturday at Washington and
Lee’s mock constitutional conven-
tion. The states’ powers act was the
only bill out of five proposed amiend-
ments to the United States Constitu-
tion approved by the more than 500
delegates at the convention.

The mock constitutional conven-
tion is believed to be the only exer-
cise of its kind in the United States
during the year of celebration in
honor of the bicentennial of the U.S.
Constitution. Rather than reenacting
the original constitutional convention
of 1787, Washington and Lee students
and students from the surrounding
women’s colleges debated contem-
porary issues.

“The Washington and Lee conven-
tion is probably as close as this na-
tion will come to a real constitutional
convention in the forseeable future,”’
said Fred Graham, the former CBS
legal affairs correspondent who
delivered the convention’s keynote
address. Graham warned the dele-

gates that although the U.S. Constitu-
tion gives them the power to do so,
they would be unwise to consider
completely changing a document
that has withstood the various and
strenuous tests of 200 years.

“This convention has the authority
to throw out the whole document”
and start over, Graham said. ‘‘The
constitution isn’t perfect, but it has
lasted 200 years.”’

The convention was gaveled to —

order at 9:30 a.m. by Chairman Peter
Bennorth. Following welcoming
remarks by W&L President John D.
Wilson and Graham’s keynote ad-
dress, the delegates got down to
serious debate.

The first issue, the call for a
balanced budget, fell short of the re-
quired 357 delegate votes at 338 votes.
Following a prolonged and heated
debate, the right-to-life amendment
was overwhelmingly rejected by 343
delegates; 128 delegates voted in
favor of the amendment.

The states’ powers act received 377
votes in favor, while 96 delegates
voted against the amendment. An
amendment calling for a line item
veto received 283 votes in favor, but
well short of the 357 required for

Jackson scheduled

for campus speech

 

From Staff Reports

 

Jesse Jackson, a candidate for the
Democratic nomination for president
in 1984, is scheduled to deliver a
speech at Washington and Lee
University at noon, Wednesday, May
13, on the Front Lawn.

As of press time, Thursday, of-
ficials with the Mock Convention had
not received a signed contract.

Jackson’s speech, sponsored by the
1988 W&L Mock Convention is free
and open to the public. In the event of
rain, Jackson will deliver his speech
in Warner Center. W&L students will
be on a shortened class schedule on
May 13 to allow them to attend the
Jackson lecture.

Sheepskin’s days are not numbered

By DANA J. BOLDEN
Staff Reporter

 

Are the days of sheepskin diplomas
at Washington and Lee numbered?
That is a question that almost every
senior and third-year law student
asks each year.

Well, there is good news for future
graduates, according to university
registrar D. Scott Dittman. W&L has
signed a contract with a company for
about 450 of the sheepskin diplomas
through 1989.

“We must order the diplomas a
year ahead of time in order for them
to age,” said Dittman. Every year

one mene:

State University in 1964.

Jackson played an important role
in the civil rights struggle of the 1960s
and helped recruit for the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference
headed by Martin Luther King Jr. In
1966 Jackson became head of the
SCLC’s Operation Breadbasket, a
systematic boycott of businesses that
exploited blacks.

In 1969 Jackson left the SCLC to
form PUSH, People United to Save
Humanity. He recruited several pro-
minent black economists and politi-
cians to develop a concise blueprint
for attacking poverty and estab-
lishing greater equality of wealth in
the U.S.

Jackson has remained a visible

figure in national politics since his
unsuccessful bid for the Democratic
nomination in 1984. He formed the
National Rainbow Coalition, an

the university signs a two-year con-

tract for the sheepskins.

At the present time the only known
manufacturer of these diplomas is a
man in England. This year the
university has agreed to pay an
estimated $14,000 for the hides. After
this contract expires, the price is ex-
pected to rise by about $2,000.

Although some would consider this
a high price to pay for diplomas, Ditt-
man says that as far as he knows no
one at W&L has complained about
the cost of the skins. Students at
other colleges — Davidson, for exam-
ple — must pay out of their own
pockets for sheepskins.

There are, however, about eight
other colleges that still award their

What some students don’t realize is
that these diplomas are destroyed
when they get wet, which can cause
problems when it rains during com-
mencement exercises. In order to
prevent the diplomas from being
destroyed, the university places
them in mailing tubes along with the
following message: THE DIPLO-

Powell
portrait to

be unveiled

By TOM BRICKEL
Staff Reporter

 

 

At 10:00 a.m. this Friday, W&L will
honor one of its most well-known and
distinguished alumni, Lewis F.
Powell Jr., with the unveiling and
dedication of his portrait in front of
Lewis Hall at the Law School.

Powell, a Supreme Court Justice
and former president of the Amer-
ican Bar Association, graduated
from Washington and Lee in 1929 and
from the law school in 1931.

According to law school Dean
Frederic Kirgis, two years ago the
Law Council, the governing body of
the law association, commissioned a
portrait of Powell by the same artist
who painted his Supreme Court por-
trait.

The portrait will hang outside the
Moot Courtroom in the law school.

Considered by many to be one of
the most important justices on the
Supreme Court, Powell is also
rémembered for his tenure as chair-
man of the Richmond school board
during the years the Richmond
public school systems were being
desegregated. His handling of the
transition was widely praised for its

propriety.
The dedication is open to the
public; the ceremony is scheduled

for the Moot Courtroom in case of in-
clement weather

Apathy, again

Frank Parsons, Executive Assistant to President Wilson,
was at last Monday’s E.C. meeting to discuss the new univer-
sity theatre. Not including the B.C. or the reporters, there
were under 10 students at the meeting. Shayam Menon, presi-
dent of the E.C., posted fliers around campus about the
discussion, so it was not that students weren’t informed. Stu-
dent apathy once again rears its ugly head.

The E.C. has begun having open discussions at each Mon-
day meeting in an effort to improve communication between
students and the E.C. and, in turn, between students and
President Wilson. A different issue is discussed each week,
and all students are encouraged to attend and express their
views. The E.C. meets with President Wilson on the following
Wednesday to report the opinions of the students.

This is an excellent opportunity for students to make
themselves heard. With the exception of stopping President
Wilson on campus, this is perhaps the most direct channel to

those who make the decisions.

Next week’s discussion is about W&L’s admissions policy.
Judging from the letters in the Phi lately, there are some peo-
ple with very strong opinions about the policy. Let’s hope the
turn out is better than at last week’s meeting.

Sometimes fair,
sometimes flawed

 

MY VIEW
By Chris Carter

 

In September of 1983 I was sitting
in Lee Chapel for the upteenth time in
four days. Then President of the Stu-
dent Body Bob Jenevine was speak-
ing to the new Freshman Class:
“Gentlemen (remember, this was
1983), some of you will not be with us
by December — history teaches us
this.” This solemn statement in
mind, Mr. Jenevine proceeded to ex-
plain the history of the Honor System
and to discuss our relationship to it.
History has borne Mr. Jenevine out
— every year there are some who
sever their relationship with the
University and fail to live up to the
tenets of the system. More than once,
I have spoken with people, some-
times close friends, whose friends
have had to leave the University
under circumstances related to
Honor. If the penalties exacted by the
Honor System sometimes seem
harsh for those forced to leave (not
that I would argue against the single-
sanction), they are equally harsh, if
not more so, for those who don’t leave
— the friends of the accused who find
themselves in the unenviable position
of having to reconcile themselves to
the fact that either their friend was
not who they thought he was, or that
the System which we all tout so
highly is flawed.

“The thing is, you see, that before,
whenever I saw one of those notices — A
member of the Student Body has been
found Guilty ... — I thought to myself,
‘Good! There's another one of them out
the door!’ Now I feel like a hypocrite —
I only fault the E.C. or question the
system when I know the person involv-
ed, How many others might have been
innocent? I mean, this is really bother-
ing me.”

Doubts like this are probably in-
evitable in our Honor System. And it
would be foolish to think that there
has never been anyone who suffered
wrongly at the hands of the Honor
System. But what then? I know some
who have allowed their distrust of the
System to consume them, who as-
sume that all those found guilty of
Honor Violations are actually inno-
cent and that justice is never served
but miscarried; I have known others
who refuse ever to think about or to
acknowledge their relationship with
a former student. Obviously, both
methods of coping actually avoid the
issue — that one’s friend might have
behaved in such a way that others
would consider dishonorable and
therefore repugnant or that the
System sometimes doesn’t work as it
should.

I can’t pose any answers to the kind
of dilemma into which this problem
throws one; rather, I feel sorry, truly
sorry, for those so thrown. There’s a
wish to play Polyanna and claim that
everything will work out for the best.
That’s unrealistic at best, unfair to
all involved at worst. What shall we
do when hurt by a System which we
whole-heartedly embrace, when forc-
ed to doubt that in which we had com-
plete faith? Address the issue. We
can become more involved with the
system itself to insure that is is work-
ing as well as is possible. And we
should recognize the complexities of
human nature Sometimes, for a vari-
ety of reasons, even those whom we
know well can act in unpredictable
and seemingly inexplicable ways.
But finally we have to keep our faith
in the System and recognize that
painful as it is sometimes, it does
serve us and generally does so well.
And those of us here, friends, frater-
nity brothers, even professors, can
say a prayer for the person who’s
gone — that maybe everything will
work out for the best in the end.

Beach ettiquette outlined

 

MY VIEW
By Abb Jones

 

Usually this column consists of the
writer giving his/her opinion on some
topic of vital importance (and in-
terest, of course) to the W&L com-
munity. But, with it being Spring
Term and all, it’s difficult to concen-
trate on schoolwork, much less have
an opinion on anything...

At least anything but the beach.
After all, it is Spring Term, where
GPA’s fall as alcohol tolerances rise.
With the advent of intense sun, blue
skies, coconut-scented suntan lotion
and lazy Sunday afternoons comes
the unyielding desire to go to the
beach.

However, before you load up the
car for a week of FITS (‘‘fun in the
sun’’) there are a few things of which
you should take note. Since there is
no existing book on Beach Etiquette
(that I know of), some friends and I
composed a list of what we call Rules
for Beach Etiquette. (You can thank
us later.)

Here are a few printable excerpts:

1. Large middle-aged men (over 30,
I guess) are prohibited from wearing
Speedo swimsuits on the beach. [This

rule could be extended to cover (no
pun intended) large middle-aged

women in two-piece swimsuits as
well. ]

2. Persons with vast amounts of
body hair (male or female) are re-
quired by law to wear clothing on the
beach, even if it requires extra effort
while swimming.

3. Persons with extremely pale
skin (requiring suntan lotion with
SPF 20) are prohibited from public
areas until what etiquette calls a
“safe”’ tan exists. (The intense glare
from pale skin could result in severe
eye damage to other beachgoers. )

4. Obnoxious children who kick up
sand (accidentally, of course!) on
others are strongly encouraged to
play with the jellyfish that frequently
wash ashore. (Just think — there
could even be forced kiddie boxing
matches with jellyfish used as boxing
gloves.)

5. Burying friends or relatives in
the sand is discouraged unless the in-
dividual in question really wants to
be buried. (It is helpful and fun to
bury the person near the shoreline if
possible, so as to get a dazzling array
of reactions and facial expressions as
the tide rolls in to the neck-deep in-
dividual.)

6. Public displays of affection are
allowed but not encouraged. (You go
to the beach to get a tan, not to ex-
change carnal knowledge.) Of
course, state of undress and time of
day have a great deal to do with
degree of etiquette.

7. Popping towels out on the beach
to remove sand particles is punish-
able by torture (via bamboo
steamers, Ginsu knives, and other
associated Ronco products).

8. Surfer types who know only the
phrase ‘“‘Hey dude, ‘sup?”’ will not,
under any conditions, be tolerated.

9. Middle-aged men who wear jams
and Vuarnet sunglasses in a des-
perate (and futile) attempt to recap-
ture their youth should be avoided at
all costs. Like bad gas, they too will
pass with time.

10. Dogs and frisbees (and their
owners) should be neutered on the
spot, especially if the dog (or owner)
leaves surprises on the beach for un-
suspecting beachgoers to step in.
(Bet you’ve never seen a neutered
frisbee, huh?)

Well, I guess that should cover
some of the beach basics. In the
meantime, when at the beach, watch :

yourself. You never know when you'll
run into someone who is familiar
with proper Beach Etiquette.

 

 

 

LETTERS

Underachievers address admissions policy

To the Editors:

We were surprised to read only one letter last
week concerning the “‘Admissions”’ articles ap-
pearing in the prior week’s Phi. We, therefore,
respond on behalf of many students:

We were stunned to read the articles about Mr.
Hartog and his admissions policy, and we
understand Mr. Hartog’s fear of sounding ar-
rogant. However, it could be argued that it is an
accurate description. We were appalled and em-
barrassed to read the article that easily could
have appeared in the parody issue. At least the
truth’s out about the policies of the Admissions
Office. Unfortunately though, our worst fears
are realized.

Mr. Hartog et al, Washington and Lee is not a
refuge for pencil-pushing, perfect-scoring, and
straight A-making students. Rather, it is an
academic environment where intelligent well-
rounded students can get an education in life, so
they can succeed in it. Your beliefs that
achievers do not make many C’s and that
students with high ability scores and spotty
grades are underachievers are ludicrous and in-
sulting to our intelligence (although our in-
telligence may not be up to W&L’s new stan-
dards). We all have made C’s both in high school
and here at W&L. We regrettably confess to be-
ing underachievers and wish you luck in your at-
tempts to keep W&L from being stuck with
underachieving, ‘‘mental midgets” such as our-
selves.

MBC lady prefers ‘guys’

To the Editors:

After reading Ms. Fowler’s “‘best definition of
a gentleman” in last week’s LETTERS, I feel
very privileged to have never met one of these
cardboard cutouts at W and L, although I do
know quite a few nice ‘“‘guys’’ from that fine
school.

‘Honorable’ equals ‘flawless’?

To the Editors:

I believe that the way our system of honor is
being applied is seriously flawed. Don’t get me
wrong, I believe that our Honor System is great.
But I believe that ine student body has lost sight
of what our Honor Code stands for and what our
current White Book is designed to do.

Our Honor System was designed to protect the
members of the Washington and Lee community
from dishonorable people. Yet I believe it has
been transformed into a mechanism that is used
too often to punish honorable, trustworthy in-
dividuals for minor mistakes and infractions.
This is why it scares so many good, honorable
people.

The single sanction of expulsion should be the
only recourse we have when we determine that
an individual is dishonorable. However, our
criterion for determining whether an individual
is not worthy of our trust has become seriously
distorted. We have all made mistakes; we’ve
told the police that we weren’t speeding when we
were, that we’ve only had two beers when we’ve
had six, we’ve told that Hollins girl that we would
call her back when we had no intention to, that
we were a high school basketball star when we
were second string. We’ve told the fraternity
president that we wouldn’t be available for
cleanup because we had a conflict, when in fact
we didn’t, that we were old enough to drink,
when we weren’t. The question we must ask is if
these human frailties render us, or any one,
dishonorable. I think not.

It seems that in our desire to protect all the
good things the Honor System does for us that
we've turned the Honor Code into a punitive
device by interpreting it so strictly that it no
longer protects us. It now frightens a great many
people by the possible misuse of the original pur-
poses of the Honor Code.

Originally the input of the student generation
was supposed to be a check on this abuse. How-
ever, the students’ perception of what the Honor
Code is, is now defined for them by the current
E.C. and we feel that we are duty-bound to ac-
cept their interpretation of what the White Book
stands for, when this is the very evil that student
input is designed to check. The E.C. is not to
blame for this, because this role has been handed
down to it with no real guidance. The mistakes
simply perpetuate themselves.

A lot of law students disagree with the single
sanction; not because they want a dishonorable
person to stay in school, but because they
perceive that in many instances the E.C. or stu-
dent jury applies the sanction to punish
trustworthy people for mistakes that are not true
indications of a person’s character. I don’t think
anyone wants to fraternize with someone they
cannot trust. Not even law students.

The first question we should ask when there is
a possible honor violation is: ‘‘If this person real-
ly did this, does this render this person unworthy
of my trust? If true, would this act be compelling
evidence that this person is inherently dis-
honorable?’’ Once that question is answered in
the affirmative, then we ask, ‘‘Did the person do
it?” Too often we hear someone say, “‘Well, it’s
not that bad, I’ve done it (either while in school
or before), but she or he got caught, and you’ve
got to pay the piper.’’ Well, that’s just plain
wrong. We’re not supposed to be exacting a price
for a wrong, we're supposed to be maintaining a
community full of decent, trustworthy, and
honorable people. There are not degrees of
honor, but I believe we need to redefine what an
honorable person is in more human terms. It
seems that theft would almost always indicate a
flaw in a person’s character that is unacceptable
to our community. It is evidence of a mental
State (a disregard for others) that is intolerable.
Cheating also evidences a lack of respect for
others, as well as for oneself, that renders an in-
dividual unworthy of trust. Lying in any form is
wrong; however, it is not always a per se indica-
tion of dishonorable conduct. It is up to the stu-
dent generation to define whether a
misrepresentation automatically renders a per-
son untrustworthy. The great majority of the stu-
dent community has misrepresented themselves
at one time or another. Are we all dishonorable?
If not now, does this mean we were dishonorable
at one time, but now we have rehabilitated
ourselves? I don’t know the answer, but the
answer should not come in the form of a policy
statement from the E.C., rather, it should come
from an independent student body, free from
E.C. pressure.

I love this school, and I’m proud of our Honor
System and our long tradition of honesty and
fairness. I strongly encouraged my brother to
come to school here. I spoke to him with pride
about our Honor System, I told him not to be
afraid of it, and that it was here to protect him. I

hope that his generation applies it fairly and just-
ly. I hope they realize that honorable people can
make mistakes, and that our Honor Code is only
designed to protect us from dishonorable, not
foolish, persons. If applied correctly, honorable
people have nothing to fear from our Honor
System.

Check policy irks student

To The Editors:

A Washington and Lee University student

casually pulled into the Stop-In mart, across
from The Hodge-Podge, Monday the 4th at 4:30
p.m. Getting out of his car he proceeded to pump
gas into the car’s tank. After pumping the gas, he
entered the mart to pay. Upon entering, the stu-
dent was roughly received with the vicious words
of: “We don’t accept student checks after May
ist.”” The student then told them that the check
was the only monetary source he had. Where-
upon a phone call was made, and the student
soon found himself in the hands of a plain-clothed
and a uniformed officer. They were called, for
the manager believed that they could escort him
to his bank, but they soon discovered that it was
in Milwaukee, WI. Also, being now 4:50, the
banks were closed. The police further inter-
rogated the student to find out that it was still
true that he had no other money. Then, not to be
left without a good comment, the plain-clothed
asked, “‘How are you going to get back to
Milwaukee without money?’”’ Whereupon the stu-
dent informed them of these new-fangled little
pieces of paper called checks and a convenient
little bookstore/co-op that cashed them (along
with “real” stores). Then they said that they
would take him there, but seeing how it was now
5:10, it was closed. While everyone stood there,
the student stated that they had accepted his
check on Saturday — which was the 2nd — and on
his calendar that was after the ist. Then the
cashier informed him that they weren’t supposed
to, Then a brilliant idea formed and the student
asked if they could “trust” him until tomorrow
for the entire amount of $4.04 — yes four dollars
and four cents. Whereupon everyone debated un-
til they agreed and now the Stop-In has more in-
formation about the student (birth, age, social
security number, etc.) than does the United
States government. After an hour’s haggle, the
student was let go with the reminder that they
had his check, number and more. Also, the
manager made sure that the officers got a good
look at his face and confirm that they could easi-
ly identify the culprit. When leaving, the student
had visions of arrest, fingerprints, and the “big
house.” So much for the CONVENIENCE
MART!

Thanks to volunteers

To the Editor:

I would like to publicly thank the brothers of
the Pi Kappa Phi social fraternity and the
members of the Alpha Phi Omega service frater-
nity and the Alcohol and Health Awareness Com-
mittee for their help with the 1987 Cancer Runs,
“A Run with George Cunningham.”

The brothers of Pi Kappa Phi served as timers
and monitors for the 5 kilometer and 10
kilometer courses. The members of Alpha Phi
Omega and the Alcohol and Health Awareness
Committee assisted with registration.

This year the event raised more than $1,500 for
the American Cancer Society. The race would
not have been a success without the help of these
three organizations.

, The proposed university theatre
will complement Gaines Hall and
‘could possibly form a new gateway to
Washington and Lee, according to
Frank Parsons, executive assistant
‘to the president.

« As part of a continuing effort to in-
crease communication between
‘students and the administration,
Parsons discussed the new theatre at
Monday’s E.C. meeting after the
‘committee viewed a promotional
wideo of the theatre starring Univer-
sity president John D. Wilson, alum-
nus Roger Mudd and Professor Al
‘Gordon of the fine arts department.

, Construction of the $9 million
theatre, scheduled to begin in mid-
2988, will take approximately 30
months to complete, according to
Parsons.

* The new theatre complex will in-
glude a 450 seat theatre and a 100 seat
experimental or black box theatre.

* The Troubador Theatre, used by
the University since the 1930s, seats
about 135 persons, but it was never
tntended to be used as a theatre.

« During the video, the theatre was
described as a_ university audi-
torium, but Senior E.C. Rep. Andrew
€aruthers noted that the 450 seat
theatre cannot seat the entire student
body.

« Parsons said existing facilities
such as the Warner Center are suffi-
cient for the number of times the en-
sire student body gathers.

Parsons was also questioned about
parking problems at W&L, problems
likely to increase since the theatre
will be built over existing parking
fots. He said he didn’t know of any
eollege that has dealt with the park-
ing problem successfully and that the
University plans on improving some
parking lots this summer.

According to Parsons, the Univer-
ity is also looking at improving
ether facilities over the next few
years, including the Co-op and
Bookstore and the science depart-
ments. Plans are also being discuss-
ed to convert the Troubador into a
liniversity cinema.

Council honors two W&L profs

From Staff Reports

 

 

Two Washington and Lee pro-
fessors have received Outstanding
Faculty Awards from the Virginia
Council of Higher Education.

Philip L. Cline, associate professor
of administration and economics,
and Leonard E. Jarrard, professor of
psychology, are among the 13 faculty
members from public and private
colleges and universities throughout
Virginia chosen for the honor. The 13
winners were selected from a field of
108 teachers nominated by their
respective institutions. W&L was
allowed to nominate two candidates,
and both nominees won.

This is the first time the awards
have been made. The 1986 Virginia
General Assembly established the
Oustanding Faculty Awards to
recognize excellence in teaching,
research, and public service.

The awards were presented at a
banquet May 5 in Richmond. Gov.
Gerald Baliles was the featured
speaker at the ceremony.

A graduate of Washington and Lee,
Cline received his M.S. and Ph.D.
from Oklahoma State University. He
joined the Washington and Lee facul-
ty in 1975. He has served as a consul-
tant to the United Nations, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, and
various private agencies and com-

From Staff Reports

 

Frederic L. Kirgis Jr., dean of
Washington and Lee’s School of Law,
has announced his resignation from
that position to devote his full time to
teaching and research.

Kirgis’ resignation is effective
June 30, 1988, unless a successor is
appointed to the position prior to that
date.

“The demands of the dean’s posi-
tion simply do not leave much time
for serious scholarship, and I gen-
uinely miss the opportunity both to
pursue my research and to teach,”’
said Kirgis, who became the law
school dean in 1983.

W&L President John D. Wilson
said that he accepted Kirgis’ resigna-
tion “reluctantly and with a most
sincere expression of gratitude for
his effective and loyal service to the
university and “the School ‘of Law

first director of the University’s
Frances Lewis Law Center, es-

Frederick Stoutland, philosophy
department chair at St. Olaf College
in Northfield, Minn., will deliver a
public lecture Thursday, May 14, at
Washington and Lee University.

The lecture, ‘Morality, the Self
and Buddhism,”’ will be at 8 p.m. in
the University Library’s Northen
Auditorium. A reception will follow
at the Morris House.

Stoutland’s visit to the campus is
sponsored by the Washington and

the university lectures committee. In
addition to his public lecture, Stout-
land will meet formally and infor-
mally with students and faculty for
two days

On Friday, May 15, Stoutland will
lead a discussion of his paper, ‘‘On

Neville Richardson, a lecturer in
the department of religious studies at
the University of Natal in Pieter-
maritzburg, South Africa, has been
named the Philip F. Howerton
visiting professor of religion for the
1987-88 academic year.

Richardson replaces religion pro-
fessor Harlan Beckley, who will be
‘on sabbatical for 1987-88. Beckley
will be doing research on the concept
of justice in American Christian
theology.

Richardson visited W&L last year
to participate in a symposium titled
“Ethics from a Theocentric Perspec-
tive,’ based on a work by James
Gustafson. While in Lexington,
Richardson delivered two lectures on
the state of affairs in South Africa,
“Being the Church in South Africa,”
and ‘South Africa’s Cry and the
World’s Response.”’

According to Beckley, a fortunate
combination of circumstances led to
the naming of Richardson as visiting
Howerton professor. “At the sym-
posium last year, Mr. Richardson ex-
pressed an interest in teaching in the
United States, having done much of
his work in connection with Ameri-
can theologians,”’ said Beckley.

‘Almost simultaneously, the
Board of Trustees decided to set
aside funds to bring South African
scholars to Washington and Lee,”
continued Beckley. “As a religion
professor would be needed anyway to

Mr. Richardson’s appointment
coincides with the Board of Trustees’
decision to increase awareness of the
South African apartheid problem on
campus. In deciding not to divest, the
Board issued a statement that read in
part, “...the Board has authorized
supplemental funds for the purpose
of enhancing our program of visitors
who by experience and scholarship
can shed light on current devel-
opments in South Africa.”

Richardson, the author of a 1977
book titled ‘“‘The World Council of
Churches and Race Relations:
1960-69,” will teach four courses dur-
ing the 1987-88 academic year. Two of
the courses, Christian Ethics and
Moral Problems, and Contemporary
Christian Theology in Ethics, are
courses currently taught by Beckley.

The Religious Struggle in South
Africa, and Modern Theology and
Political Oppression (Religion 215
and 216 respectively), will be offered
only in conjunction with Richard-
son’s visit.

“We are hoping that, through
Richardson's presence, awareness
and discussion of the apartheid pro-
biem will continue on the W&L cam-
pus, said Beckley. A strong opponent

Heaney’s version of an Irish legend
in verse and prose.

“The Haw Lantern,” Heaney’s
latest book of poetry, will be publish-
ed in the fall/winter of 1987-88.

Heaney graduated from Queen’s
University, Belfast, with first class
honors in English language and
literature. After 10 years of teaching,
he worked as a free-lance writer and
presented a weekly book review pro-
gram on Irish radio, and broadcast
regularly on BBC radio and televi-
sion.

He then returned to teaching,
heading the English department at
Campfort College in Dublin and then
taught a year at the University of
California in Berkeley. He began lec-
turing at Harvard in 1981, where he is
currently Boylston Professor of
Rhetoric and Oratory.

Admissions house proceeding smoothly

 

BY MARGARET PIMBLETT
Staff Reporter

 

Work on the Gilliam Admissions
House is progressing smoothly, with
the admissions and financial aid of-
fices expected to move into new
quarters there in September, accord-
ing to Frank Parsons, the assistant to
the president.

“September is a fairly slow admis-
sions month,”’ Parsons said, which
would allow the admissions staff
time to make the switch from offices
in Washington Hall to the renovated
house next to dupont Hall.

The building is one of four houses

ee eS

built in the 1840s as faculty
residences. The others are now the
Lee-Jackson House, the Morris
House, and the Reeves Center.

The space to be vacated by the ad-
missions office and financial aid of-
fices will allow the development of-
fice to move out of the Howard House
(the white house next to R.E. Lee
Episcopal Church) and into Washing-
ton Hall.

The office switches will, however,
resemble a game of ‘musical
chairs,’’ Parsons said, with other ad-
ministrative departments currently
in Washington Hall being moved
elsewhere in the building or into
other spaces.

With some renovation and im-
provement, the Howard House will
remain administrative office space.

In addition, the university recently
acquired the red house behind the
Episcopal church and plans to create
new offices and seminar rooms
there.

Parsons said that the projected in-
crease in the size of the student body
to 1,500 will necessitate the hiring of
several new faculty members.
Rather than creating faculty offices
in the red house, some seminar
rooms in the academic buildings may
be converted into offices, with the
seminar rooms in the red house being
used for the displaced classes,

ratification.

The equal rights amendment was
soundly defeated, with 398 delegates
voting against the amendment. A
sixth amendment, sponsored from
the floor by the delegates of the
states of Oklahoma and Texas, called
for a bill that would make English the
official language of the United
States. The amendment fell narrowly
short of the required 357 votes at 339
votes

The convention adjourned for the
final time at 9:30 p.m,

The atmosphere of the constitu-
tional convention was much like that

at one of Washington and Lee’s mock
political conventions, but on a
smaller scale. Students carried
placards and other items represen-
ting their states. The delegation from
Tennessee carried a velvet painting
of Elvis Presley.

Debate between the delegates was
often lively. The student delegates
spent hours studying the positions on
the issues their states supported.
Many delegates, although not actual-
ly from the states they were repre-
senting, spoke knowledgeably of
their state’s positions.

Murph knows what’s going on

 

By JOHN PACKETT
Staff Reporter

Charles F. Murray, better known
to the Lexington and Washington and
Lee communities as Murph, is the

man, who knows just about every-
thing that happens on the Washington
and Lee campus.

Since taking the job as proctor of
W&L, Murph has seen just about
every college prank, stunt and crime.

Now, after 18 years on the job,
Murph, who turns 65 this year, has a
tough decision to make.

“Well, I thought that I might retire
at the end of the year, but I don’t
think I could stand the idle hours,”’
said Murph.

“Dean John and President Wilson
keep trying to get me to stay for one
more year,” he said. ‘I asked what
they were going to do at the end of
next year, aske me to stay one more
year? And they said yes.”

Murph was born in Lexington and
spent the first 10 years of his life
here. Then, with the death of his
mother, he moved to Lynchburg
where he graduated from E.C. Glass
High School.

After high school, Murph served in
the Marines from 1942 to 1946 aboard
Navy ships in the invasion of Africa
and Italy. From the Marines, he
returned to Lexington and worked as
a lieutenant on the police force from

1946 to 1958.

“The police force is where I got a
lot of experience and met people that
would be helpful in the future,” said
Murph.

“T only had to pull a gun on some-
one once in my life,’’ said Murph. “A
guy had stolen a car and we had been
searching for him all night. After my
shift, my partner was taking me to
my neighborhood, the only area I
hadn’t searched, and across from my
house I saw the stolen car parked,
and there was someone asleep in the
driver’s seat. So I pulled out my gun
and approached the car and arrested
the man.”

According to Murph, it turned out
that the man had escaped prison in
Louisiana and had more than 30
charges on his record.

“Being a police officer taught me
what to do and not to do in certain
situations,’ said Murph.

In December of 1959, Murph
answered an advertisement in the
paper for the job of proctor at
Washington and Lee. He was chosen
for the job and started work on Fancy
Dress weekend 1959. For 10 years he
was the only security on the campus
except for a night watchman.

Since coming to Washington and
Lee, Murph has patrolled the dorms,
written parking tickets and tried as
hard as he could to keep the students
out of trouble.

“T think, if I’m around, I can see

is honorable and what this school is
all about.”

In the criminal part of his job
Murph does everything from writing

out parking tickets to finding
students or others who have stolen
things from the dorms.

“‘I’d say since I have been here,
there has been well into the
thousands and thousands of dollars
worth of merchandise and cash
stolen,”’ he said

He believes the biggest crime
around here is probably breaking in
to cars or lifting merchandise from
rooms.

“‘T always hope it is not the students
that are causing the trouble, because
I don’t want to have to do anything to
them. Most of it I could recover by
just knowing the nature of the crime.
I guess it’s just a matter of being
around the community for so long.”’

Because he is not a sworn law of
ficer, Murph can approach those who
he thinks are guilty and ask them if
they have done something wrong
without reading them their rights.

It is hard to avoid the eye of Murph
He has recovered most of the mer-
chandise stolen on the campus. He
knows all that happens because he is
around all the time.

Maybe this is why students and
faculty always say: ‘If you want to
know what goes on at Washington
and Lee just ask Murph.”’

NOTE: The ITCA poll used for
this analysis was released on
4/27/87, the final poll conducted
for the season. Several teams
have played matches since then,
and this explains why the eight
teams selected for the champion-
ships were not the top eight teams
in the poll.

KALAMAZOO
Kalamazoo, Mich.
Record; 12-6
Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches’
Ranking; No. 1

The Hornets have four players
returning from last year’s cham-
pionship squad... Record is
deceiving, having played top-
notch Division I competition in-
cluding Vanderbilt, Rollins,
Florida, Florida St., Miami of
Ohio and Notre Dame... Rap
against Kalamazoo is that it
doesn’t play enough top-ranked
Division III schools, but nothing
could be further from the truth —
beat up on Emory (9-0, ITCA No.
14) and Wheaton (8-1, ITCA No.
24)... Also captured 8 of 9 flights in
tournament with Depauw, Deni-
son and Wooster —all of which are
ranked in the Top 20 of D-III ten-

Lakes region...

Kalamazoo is loaded with great
players including Alex Palladino
(ITCA No. 3), Jim Burda (ITCA
No. 57) and Jack Hosner (ITCA
No, 58)... Palladino has not lost a
singles match since the team’s
spring trip and has defeated a
bunch of D-I players... Palladino
also teams with Burda for the
doubles competition, and they are
ranked No. 1 and are the defen-
ding national doubles cham-
pions... “It took 24% hours to pick
the field,’ said head coach George
Acker. “That’s how close the

ITCA Ranking: No. 2

The Generals are looking for
revenge after last year’s 6-3 loss
in the finals to Kalamazoo...
Finished 8th in the tournament in
1985... The Generals’ schedule
was not one of the most difficult...
D-I victories include James

The regular season is over. The
reservations are booked. The bus is
packed and fueled up. It’s time to get
down to business.

On Sunday, for the third con-
secutive year, the Washington and
Lee men’s tennis team officially
received its invitation to the National
Collegiate Athletic Association Divi-
sion III Championships at Salisbury,
Md., on May 11-17. Now all that re-
mains for the Generals, ranked 2nd
in the nation by the Intercollegiate
Tennis Coaches’ Association, are the
final preparations and tuneups and
the actual matches for the national ti-
tle.

“I’m encouraging our team mem-
bers to play as much tennis as possi-

ble,”’ said head coach Gary Franke.
‘“‘We went to Staunton on Monday to
play indoors just in case the tourna-
ment has to be played indoors.”

Franke said he pushed the team
hard Monday and Tuesday and then
gave the players a rest on Wednes-
day before a practice match today.
The Generals travel to Richmond to
face Hampton Institute, a Division II
school that is also in the midst of
preparing for a national tournament,
before embarking for the champion-
ships at 5 p.m. on Friday.

One of Franke’s main concerns
these last two weeks has been the
condition of sophomore Bobby Mat-
thews’ right hand. Matthews injured
his hand on the trip in Florida and did
not play in the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference Championships. Franke,
however, was extremely optimistic

 

ANALYSIS
Parity describes field; could lead to upsets in first round

Ill wins were Swarthmore (8-1),
Rochester (5-1), Emory (7-2, IT-
CA No. 14) and Wheaton (7-2, IT-
CA No. 24)... Also handed losses to
D-I UNC-Charlotte (6-3) and
Depaul (8-1)... Ranked 2nd behind
W&L in the South Atlantic re-
gion...

Alejandro Hernandez (ITCA
No. 10 as a singles player) returns
for Washington; he has lost only
one D-III match this season... Not
to be outdone, Larry Gewer (24-2,
ITCA No. 28) went undefeated in
D-III competition... No. 3 singles
player Claudio Gonzalez has also
been extremely tough... Gewer
and Hernandez (ITCA No. 15)
team up to give the Sho’men some
strength in doubles... ‘‘I hope we
can use some of the experience we
gained from playing last year,”
said head coach Fred Wyman. “I
hope we feel at home [in Salis-
bury]. It’s kind of like playing in
our own backyard.”

Odds: 3 to1

UC-SANTA CRUZ
Santa Cruz, Calif.
Record: 15-6

ITCA Ranking: No. 4

The Sea Lions have not lost a D-
III match all season long and their
schedule is challenging... Check
out these wins: Claremont (9-0),
Principia (6-3), Redlands (5-4, IT-
CA No; 7), Whitman (73, ITCA
No. 10) and UC-San Diego (8-1, IT-
CA No. 13)... Schedule also con-
tained five D-I teams and one D-II
school...

Ron Ward (ITCA No. 4) and
Chad Andrews (ITCA No. 15) pro-
vide plenty of firepower in the
singles department for the Sea
Lions... Doubles team of Mark
Cassell and Jordan Einbinder
(ITCA No. 8) is also one to watch
out for... Santa Cruz is somewhat
of a mystery, especially when
looking at its unusually close
score with Redlands and then its
blowout of Claremont... ‘We

played five of the top twelve

teams,” said head coach Bob

Hansen. ‘‘Any team in there [the

championship] can winit all.”
Odds: 4 to1

PRINCIPIA

Elsah, Ill.

Record: 19-6

ITCA Ranking: No. 5

The Panthers mixed up their
schedule with an even balance of
D-I and D-III opponents... D-I vic-
tories over St. Louis, Bradley and
Eastern Illinois were most im-
pressive... Have played two of the
eight tournament teams, defeat-
ing Claremont, 5-4, while losing to
Santa Cruz, 3-6... Other notable D-
Ill wins came over St. Thomas
(ITCA No. 23) and Wheaton ITCA
No. 24)...

Principia has the No. 1-ranked
D-III player in the nation in Toby
Clark, who won the singles title in
1985, and other fine singles
players in Tom Kollock (ITAC No.
16) and Chris Caldwell (ITAC No.
46)... Doubles tandem of Caldwell
and Kollock are ranked No. 2...
The Panthers have been in a sur-
prisingly large number of 5-4
matches, which has led some to
believe they lack depth at the No.
4, 5 and No. 6 singles and No. 3
doubles... ‘‘We’ve had good close

.-matches,”’ said head ceach Larry ~*

Gerber. “‘[No one team] seems to
be dominating this year. The field
appears to be more balanced.”

Odds: 6 to1

CLAREMONT
Claremont, Calif.
Record: 20-11
ITCA Ranking: No. 6

The Stags are back in the tour-
nament after not being invited
last year, despite hosting the
championships... Have played the
most difficult D-III schedule of all
the teams competing... Went 7-5 in

about Matthews, the No. 2 singles
player, being ready for nationals.
“We think he’ll be 100 percent,”’ he
said. ‘‘He was hitting overheads and
serving. Most of the pain is gone.”’

Matthews’ availability will be key
if the Generals want a chance to
avenge last year’s 6-3 loss to
Kalamazoo in the finals. Kalamazoo
in once again perched on top, holding
the No. 1 ranking throughout the
season. The other six teams selected
to play in the championships were
Washington College, the University
of California Santa Cruz, Principia,
Claremont, Rochester, and Swarth-
more.

According to Franke, this year’s
field is much more balanced from top
to bottom. One example can be seen
in the W&L-Swarthmore match earl-
ier in the year, in which W&L won by

12 matches versus the top teams
in the nation with wins over
Rochester (5-4), Swarthmore
(5-4), Washington University (8-1,
ITCA No. 22), and Carleton (5-4,
ITCA No. 15) and Redlands twice
(ITCA No. 7)... Lost a close 5-4
match to Principia... 12-0 con-
ference record, first time
undefeated in 23 years...

Frank Hinman (18-8, ITCA No.
5) and Paul Scholtz (18-8, ITCA
No. 39) are the big guns for Clare-
mont... Three of Hinman’s losses
were at the hands of higher-
ranked players in D-III... Scholtz
is 11-1 in last 12 matches and won
the conference singles champion-
ship... Hinman and Scholtz (ITCA
No. 4) are also the team’s best
doubles pair. .. ‘We've played
more top teams than anyone,”’
said head coach Hank Krieger.
‘“‘We know what it’s like to be ina
close match, and it could be an ad-
vantage.”

Odds: 5 to1

ROCHESTER
Rochester, N.Y.
Record: 13-6
ITCA Ranking: No. 8

The Yellowjackets’ solid
schedule and crucial win over
Swarthmore secured them the bid
to nationals... Defeated Swarth-

more (5-4), Emory (7-2, ITCA No.

14) in D-III portion of season and
Colgate (6-3) in D-I... Narrowly
defeated by Claremont and
Redlands (ITCA No. 7) by 5-4
margins... Also beaten by Wash-
ington College (5-1) but did not
play doubles...

Singles player Joachim Ham-
mer (5-5, ITCA No. 8) is
Rochester’s top gun... Has scored
wins over Jimmy Strauss (ITCA
No. 14) of Emory and Washington
University’s Duncan Seay (ITCA
No. 13)... Eric Lipton (8-5, ITCA
No. 60) and Mark Frisk (10-6, IT-
CA No. 61) are the other notable

the deceiving score of 8-1. Swarth-
more could have very easily held a
3-3 tie after the six singles matches
(the Little Quakers lost two in tight
three-setters) and made the match
much closer.

W&L will also have at least four
and possibly all six players com-
peting in the individual segment of
the championships that begin on
Thursday. Sophomore Robert Haley
(ranked No. 9 by the ITCA), Mat-
thews (27th-ranked), junior David
McLeod (59th-ranked) and senior
Roby Mize will compete in the
singles. Matthews and McLeod
(ranked 3rd in doubles) and Haley
and Mize will participate in the
doubles competition. The doubles
tandem of junior Chris Wiman and

players in the lineup... Frisk has
been especially impressive,
beating both Paul Scholtz of
Claremont and Claudio Gonzalez
of Washington College... Frisk
and Hammer (8-3, ITCA No. 9)
team up to give some power in
doubles... ‘I think the top four is
definitely going to survive the
first round,” said head coach Pete
Lyman. “The semifinals and
finals are going to be very in-
terestang matches, though.”’
Odds: 14to1

SWARTHMORE
Swarthmore, Pa.
Record: 10-14

ITCA Ranking: No. 9

The Little Quakers play one of
the most challenging regular
season schedules one could im-
agine... Were competitive in D-I
matches against Temple, Prince-
ton, University California -Santa
Barbara, San Jose St., Penn St.
and University of Penn... D-III
schedule reads even more dif-
ficult with wins over Redlands
(ITAC No. 7) and Emory (ITAC
No. 14), as well as tough 5-4 losses
to Rochester and Claremont...
12th straight year the Quakers
have been invited to nationals...

* “Won team championship in 1985....

Swarthmore will rely on singles
player Andy Mouer (ITAC No. 35)
and doubles team of Mouer and
Vivek Varma (ITAC No. 20)... Not
much firepower in terms of
highly-ranked players but do have
good depth... Was some question
as to whether or not Swarthmore
would be selected... ‘‘I feel we are
deserving of going,” said head
coach Mike Mullan. “‘It was close.
The field is not as top-heavy as
last year. I feel that our team does
have the potential to be suc-
cessful.”’

pull away. The Generals stepped up
their play a notch on both ends of the
field and began to pull away from the
Maroons.

The third quarter has been good to
the Generals all year long. W&L
outscored its opponents 53-18 in that
quarter during the regular season,
and yesterday they added to that
statistic.

At one end of the field, Church and
the rest of the W&L defense shut out
the Maroons for the entire third
quarter (as well as the first two-
thirds of the fourth period). At the
other end of the field, the Generals
peppered the Roanoke defense for
five goals. Leading the assult were
Redfern (four goals, four assists on

 

 

the afternoon) and Smith, with his
best game in a W&L uniform (five
goals on the day).

“Pete [Smith] is one of four guys
we call the muckers,”’ said Daly. The
others are seniors Joe Krastel, Bill
Garavente, and Bill Garret. ‘‘We
rotate them in at the third attack
spot.

“Sometimes things are working
better for one than the other, maybe
a certain guy saw something when he
was on the sidelines. We certainly
aren’t afraid to use any one of them.”

W&L’s outstanding third quarter
built their lead to 13-7, but, with last
week’s W&L comeback fresh in the
mind’s of everyone, nobody counted
the Maroons out.

The Generals continued to work
hard both offensively and defensively
to keep the Maroons from mounting
any type of comeback. Church con-

 

asalidiiiiiimmidiiiienensiniiicaaiie sca
tinued to shut the Maroons down in
their offensive end, not allowing th:
Maroons to score until there wer
under six minutes remaining in the
game.

Late in the game, with the
Generals victory assured, Churcl
came out in favor of junior Pau’
Burke. Church, on the afternoon
made 18 saves, several of them in
one-on-one situations. In addition, his
outlet passing set up many offensive
opportunities for the Generals.

Said Daly of the game, “I didn’t
think that this team deserved to lose
three in a row.”

“We controlled the midfield and
did a great job defensively.”

‘I don’t think we could have played
any better in our transition game.
which is the kind of game we like to
play.”

Lake praises lax team’s success

By JIM LAKE
Staff Reporter

 

Talk about success. The Washington and Lee lacrosse
team, under head coach Dennis Daly, owns an 11-3
record and is competing for the national championship.

“So what? So are three other teams,’’ you may point
out. But there are a few other things to keep in mind,
things that make W&L’s presence in this field a truly
outstanding accomplishment, one that shows how able
and talented Daly and his athletes really are.

Success at Washington and Lee has been slow in com-
ing for Daly. The Generals’ 11th lacrosse coach started
out with three losing seasons. Daly’s teams were 5-9 in
1984, 3-8 in 1985, and 5-8 in 1986.

The shift to Division III, however, has allowed Daly’s
skills as a coach to shine through. For three years, he
has tried to out-coach scholarship athletes with student
athletes, leading to a 13-25 overall record.

As Daly commented after this year’s season opening
loss to the University of Virginia, if a Division I school
doesn’t have stronger, quicker and faster athletes than
a Divison III opponent, then the D-I coach isn’t doing his
job as a recruiter. Any large school is bound to have
more coaches, more trainers, better facilities, and bet-
ter name recognition than a small program, and this
puts the smaller institution at a disadvantage before the
rules about financial grants-in-aid are even considered.

In recent years, as the financial backing by the fans and
alumni for Division I lacrosse has increased, those
schools which are allowed to award scholarships ob-
viously have been able to recruit more and more of the
nation’s best athletes.

Now, Daly is able to compete with schools under the
same financial restrictions as W&L, and it certainly
didn’t take long for the coach to take advantage of the
newfound parity. But there’s a catch: even with finan-
cial equality, W&L remains at a disadvantage.

W&L’s rigorous admissions standards have a pro-
found effect on the number of high school graduates
available to a coach, in that his pool of recruits is
significantly smaller than the number of graduating
high school seniors in any particular year. Thus
Washington and Lee coaches are at a disadvantage.

Furthermore, the time demands and pressure placed
on W&L student athletes by their first priority,
academics, are, in many cases, more strenuous than
those carried by the Generals’ opponents. Thus
Washington and Lee student athletes are at a disadvan-
tage.

Nevertheless, Daly’s 11-3 reccrd shows that, with
hard work and dedication, W&L students can compete
with comparable athletes, despite heavy academic re-
quirements.

So congratulations, Coach Daly. No matter how far
W&L goes in the tournament, you and your players
deserve it. Just being competitive is an accomplish-
ment; anything else is gravy.

The next opponent the Generals
will face in the National Collegiate
Athletic Association’s Division III
lacrosse tournament is the Ohio-
Wesleyan Bishops.

Earlier this year, the Generals
defeated the Bishops by a 12-9 score
in Lexington, but that was the last
loss for Ohio-Wesleyan. Since that
setback on March 12. the Bishops
have gone 12-0, running their record
to 13-2, and in the process ascending
to the No. 1 spot in the United States

poll. The Bishops currently share the
top spot with Hobart, the defending
national champion.

The Bishops have two tournament
opponents in common with the
Generals. Both teams played
Roanoke and Washington College.
Ohio-Wesleyan won both games,
whereas the Generals lost both
games.

According to Ohio-Wesleyan head
coach Mike Pressler, the Bishops like
to play an aggressive transition
game. He said they like to push the
ball upfield.

“We like to force the fast break,”’
said Pressler, ‘‘and take it away

from the other team.”’

According to Pressler, the key
players for Ohio-Wesleyan are junior
attackman Rob Alvino, the team’s
leading scorer and an all-American
last season, junior midfielder Charlie
Blanchard, who had 35 goals this past
season, and junior goaltender Don
O'Neill, a third team all-America last
year whom Pressler called ‘‘as good
as anyone out there’’ and ‘‘the key to
our team.”’

Going into the tournament Pressler
seemed optimistic. ‘‘We’re healthy
and we’re coming off a big win
against Denison, our big rival out
here.”

infuriate the Generals as they reeled
off seven consecutive wins before
spring break, pasting nationally
ranked Emory and Swarthmore by
the score of 8-1 along the way.

Spring break meant a trip to
Florida and the Generals retained
the momentum they had captured in
the win streak. Two shutouts of St.
Leo and Stetson were followed by two
close 5-4 losses to Rollins and
Flagler. W&L then assured a suc-
cessful trip by nipping N. Florida,
5-4.

Domination is what best describes
the Generals’ final week of the
season. Without Matthews, W&L
scored easy wins over Christopher
Newport and Averett before storm-
ing into the ODAC championships.

Jackson calls for

By STEVEN POCKRASS

‘

 

For about 40 minutes early
‘Wednesday afternoon, the Rev. Jesse
Jackson spoke at Washington and
Lee about farms, factories and the
"future.

, Then he had some fun playing

“Jesse Says.”

* An ordained Baptist minister,
»Jackson seemed to be doing more
than speaking Wednesday.
* Appearing before a massive front-
slawn audience estimated at 2,500, the
45-year-old potential presidential
"candidate asked that those who knew
«of someone who had died of drug use
to raise their hands. A few did.

When he asked how many knew
“someone who was in jail because of
drugs, many hands went up, and
when he asked how many knew
«someone who had used drugs, almost
every hand was raised.

In an interview after the speech,
«Jackson called drugs ‘‘the number
one threat to this generation of
youth.”

Tennis takes second

For the entire Division lili men’s
‘tennis season, Kalamazoo was rank-
red No. 1 with Washington and Lee
,ranked No. 2.

Yesterday in Salisbury, Md., those
*rankings proved to be prophetic as
,Kalamazoo defeated’ the
Generals, , in the National Col-
‘legiate Athletic Association D-III na-
, tional championship finals.

It is the second consecutive year
"that W&L has finished in second
«place and the fourth time in 13 years.

reluctantly began to file down the
grassy hill toward Lee Chapel. Soon,
a large throng of 100 or more students
was gathering in front of Jackson.

“It’s getting crowded but that’s all
right,”’ said Jackson, who ran unsuc-
cessfully for the Democratic nomina-
tion in 1984. Making light of the name
“mock convention,” he called the
unregistered students ‘mock Amer-
icans.”’ Jackson then asked the
others in the audience to give those
students a round of applause for be-
ing honest about not being regis-
tered. It’s not often that Jackson
calls for applause for non-registered
voters.

Jackson’s speech was the kickoff
for the upcoming 1988 Mock Demo-
cratic Convention, which will be held
on March 25 and 26. Jackson is “the
most controversial person we could
bring to speak,’’ said Mare L. Gor-
don, a junior from Columbia,
Missouri, who arranged the visit.
Gordon is speakers and protocol
chairman for the convention.

The main focus of the speech was
on the broad themes Jackson tends to
stress—economic recovery, human
rights, equal rights and _ voter
registration.

“Economic justice, economic com-

make us strong again,” Jackson
said. “There must be profound eco-

one of the three remaining sigles

chance.

All three went the distance of three
sets and it was the tiebreaker that
turned out to be W&L’s worst enemy.
Senior captain Roby Mize lost a
heartbreaker at No. 4, 6-3 3-6 7-6 to
Rick Verheul, and Jim Hufler slipped
by junior Chris Wiman, 7-6 1-6 6-4 at
No. 5. Finally, Dave Borski defeated
freshman John Morris, 7-6 5-7 6-3, to
close out the match before the
doubles portion could even get under

record in tiebreakers was 1-3.

Washington and Lee University
has begun an effort to build a com-
* prehensive center for the performing
arts on its campus. Once completed,
the facility will serve as the
« Lexington-Rockbridge area's only
center for the performance of drama,
music, and dance.

* Construction on the $9 million
, facility will begin in the spring of

1988, if sufficient funding is secured
* by that time, with completion sched-
, uled for 1990. To date, $4 million has

been contributed for the center by
* alumni, foundations and corpora-
tions.

“The new center for the perform-
ing arts speaks to the educational

Huntley Pavilion on Thursday even-
ing. Security personnel outnumbered
patrons until around 11:30. Eventual-
ly about 30 people showed up to see
the Limit and Skip Castro. The low
attendance was blamed on poor ad-
vertising and the fact that there had
to be a beer garden.

Said IFC vice president George
Early, “Thursday night was pretty
much of a flop.”

‘*No one bothered to go out,’’ added
former IFC president Chris Saxman.
“‘T was kind of let down by the frater-
nities. All that hard work and no one
sh »wed up.”

Yet Saxman believes that this
year’s Greek Week was a good begin-
ning. ‘I think we've set a nice base.
There was enthusiasm in all of the
activities and everyone had fun.
We'll learn from our mistakes and go
from there.”’

said John D. Wilson, president of
Washington and Lee, in announcing
the project. ‘Music, drama, and
dance play significant roles already
in the university's educational pro-
gram and in its service to the wider
Lexington-Rockbridge community.
The new center will simply improve
and expand our offering.”’

The need for a comprehensive
facility to house the performing arts
at Washington and Lee is well-
documented. For more than 50 years,
the program has been housed in a
mid-19th century structure — the

The Rev. Jesse Jackson, at least
temporarily the Democratic
front-runner for the presidency,
said Wednesday that he.regretted

who bowed out of the campaign

But he also said that Hart’s

cessively as shoe factory, roller rink,
dance hall, pool hall, and hardware
store. It was acquired by the univer-
sity in 1929 and turned into a theatre
workshop. In 1935, various improve-
ments were made and the former
shoe factory became the Washington
and Lee Troubadour Theatre. The
W&L fine arts department also uses
the Boiler Room Theatre in the base-
ment of the Old Main Street Shopping
Mall to present experimental
theatreworks.

As early as 1964, the trustees, ad-
ministration, and faculty recognized
the need for a center for the perfor-
mrng arts. Yet, it was only after the
renovation of practically every
building on campus and the construc-
tion of a new undergraduate library,
law school building, gymnasium, and

residence hall that attention could be
turned to the need for a theatre. All of
the university’s National Historic
Landmark buildings have been com-
pletely renovated and returned to ac-
tive use.

The center for the performing arts
will be located diagonally across
Nelson Street from Gaines Hall, the
new student residence currently
under construction,

The center will stand in the middle
of a landscaped parking area and en-
try plaza. The design motif achieved
by Gaines Hall will be carried across

Women’s
sponsors

By STACY MORRISON
Staff Reporter

 

 

Organizers of the upcoming Confet-
tis weekend are estimating that the
event will cost approximately $6,500.

“The cost all depends on how many
people go,” said Liz Smith, one of
three social chairwomen of the
Women’s Forum, which is sponsor-
ing Confettis.

Revenue for the event, which will
take place this weekend, will come
primarily from ticket and T-shirt
sales. Anne Schroer, associate dean
of students and adviser to the
Women’s Forum, expects ticket sales
to generate about $6,000.

The cost of food is a big variable in
estimating the budget of Confettis,
because the formal’s organizers will
not order food until they know how
many people are attending. The two
bands, Heinsohn and Day and The
Connells, cost $1,900, and the rental
of Zollman’s Pavilion adds $200.

The Executive Committee gave
$125 to Confettis to defray printing
costs for the invitations, Smith said.
The dean of students office is paying
for the speaker at the Friday night
banquet, said Schroer.

The speaker will be Sybil Todd,
associate dean of students at the
University of Virginia.

“Mr. Darrell helped us with food
for the banquet on Friday and the
brunch on Sunday because of the

The center’s gatehouse tower will
be located astride the old railroad
trestle, which will become a brick-
covered footbridge to the campus.
The old Lexington train station adja-
cent to the new theatre site will be
associated with the theatre plans.
Visitors to the center will have ac-
cess to the upper and lower levels of
the building through the gatehouse,
entering an aluminum and glass
vestibule that opens into the main
lobby.

seat 425 in comfort, and the rise is

ded.

Although Confettis is being spon-
sored by the Women’s Forum, Smith
pointed out that all women under-
graduate students may attend. “It
isn’t limited to just the women who
have been working with the Women’s
Forum.’

“The whole thing is in response to
the women not having anything that
they could do together as an organiz-
ed group,”’ Smith continued. ‘‘We are
trying to pull the undergraduate
women together.

Schroer sees Confettis as ‘‘a
chance for the women to reciprocate.
Everything of a party nature at W&L
has been centered around the frater-

Getting
together

There is a new feature in The Ring-tum Phi, called “‘From
the Hill,’ in which issues pertinent to Washington and Lee
University are discussed weekly by different members of the
administration. The Phi is glad President John D. Wilson is
inaugurating the column this week.

“From the Hill” is another step that has been taken to im-
prove relations between the administration and the student
body. Tightening the lines between the groups will improve
the implementation of university programs and student sat-
isfaction with the school.

Another important aspect of the new effort in communica-
tion is the Executive Committee’s new forums discussing
issues the student body considers important. Administration
members are there to answer questions and listen to student
concerns. This gives a chance for close interaction between
students and the Hill, and also provides more immediate
ansers to the questions of both groups.

Although the first EC forum, which concerned the universi-
ty’s plans to build a new theater, was rather poorly attended,
attendance at last Monday’s meeting was higher. Director of
Admissions William M. Hartog was there to help the student
body better understand admissions policy.

Students need to make sure they keep the interest in the
forum alive. The administration has made the first move by
agreeing to send representatives to the meetings; the
students must reciprocate and attend the meetings. Other-
wise student-administration relations will continue to be
broken down by misunderstandings and lack of communica-
tion.

If students do not take the time to voice their opinions about
matters relevant to the university, then they should not
bother to complain at all. The opinion page of the Phi and the
EC forums are not the only avenues open to students; writing
of calling administrators or faculty can often make a dif-
ference, but only if enough students become involved in cam-
pus life. Until that happens, nothing will ever be changed.

Wrap up

Editor recalls ‘achievements’ of past year

 

FINAL VIEW
By Sean Bugg

As the term begins to wind down
and summer vacation approaches, I
think it is a good time to look back
and take note of some of the things
that made the year memorable, lest
we forget all that was done both
publicly and behind our backs.

First, I would like to congratulate
the freshmen on their apparently
never-ending drive to surpass
academically all previous classes at
Washington and Lee. Although stu-
dent organizations and activities will
suffer from their apathy, at least
their grades will be high.

Director of Admissions William M.
Hartog gets the ‘‘Cockiness Will Get
You Anywhere” award for the year.

Not only were W&L students surpris-

ed to hear they were underachievers
if they made a C or D in school, they
also learned one minority student
was accepted with SATs under 1,000.
while ‘‘two young men whose SATs
are below 1,000 [were] rejected
because they can’t do the work,”’ ac-
cording to the admissions story in the
Roanoke Times and World News. The
admissions office gets a special gold
star for consistency in standards.

It is hard to decide who should win
an award for the hardest work on a
dead issue. Should it go to the
students who organized a protest
against the change from Coke to Pep-
si, or Rick Robins and his petition to
repeal coeducation? I think it is a tie.
Actually, just seeing students get in-
volved at W&L is enough of a treat; I
think I may be asking too much of
them to become involved in issues
they can actually do something

about.

University Registrar D. Scott Ditt-
man deserves special mention for his
let’s-try-to-be-like-everyone-else at-
titude. Being the unique university
that it is, W&L needs a better excuse
to install a new computer registra-
tion system than the ‘‘fact’’ that
other universities do it that way.
While the old, and now resurrected
system has its problems, at least
students did not have to pull all-
nighters in the library to get into
classes they wanted.

The most flawed logic of the year
has come from students who have
said fg¢ke I.D.s should not be honor
violations because people using them
do not believe the law should prohibit
them from drinking. I’ll remember
that logic the next time I want a new
tape, and I’ll just pick it out of the
Bookstore without paying. I mean, I
certainly think Virginia’s shoplifting

laws are completely bogus. Or ma;
be I could just go to Roanoke, where
will not be “‘easily identifiable as
Washington and Lee student.” It ‘
good to know so many people hav
coats of honor that can be taken off a
the situation demands.

And who can forget the administra
tion’s apparent decision that a Ph.D
is a better measure of a professor’:
value than the ability to teach. While
a Ph.D. is certainly of value, W&:
should concentrate on building
talented faculty that cares for its
students, and not a faculty that looks
good only in admissions brochures.

No one should forget the mistakes
that have been made this year, for
much can be learned from them. One
can only hope that fewer mistakes
will be made in the future and tha?
students, faculty and administration
will learn to cooperate in an effort to
make W&L better than before.

What’s the big deal with Gary Hart?

 

MY VIEW
By Jennifer Spreng

 

Gary Hart’s withdrawal from the
Presidental elections is a larger
bummer for the United States than
one might think.

No one will ever know if he would
have been a good President. My
suspicion is that he would have been,
but that doesn’t really matter now.

What is most bothersome is that I
can’t see that Gary Hart did anything
wrong! I certainly don’t see anything
that should have made him so
undesirable to the voting public.

Gary Hart’s “crimes’’ certainly
weren’t unprecedented in US.
political history, nor were they par-
ticularly abnormal behaviors in
modern society.

Take for instance, his name change
from ‘‘Hartpence”’ to “‘Hart.”’

Com’on, be reasonable. Would you
have entered politics with a last
name like ‘‘Hartpence?”’ Face it, it’s
lousy for slogans and more likely to
turn off voters than endear them.

Besides, people change their
names all the time these days. Be-
tween divorce, remarriage, and the

high proportion of female-headed
families, names don’t have quite the
same meaning as they used to. Many
are little more than legal tools and
simple means of identification. If
Gary Hart thought that ‘‘Hart’’
would satisfy those needs better than
“Hartpence,’’ why condemn him for
action he took long ago? I’m impress-
ed that he was so practical.

This age business is silly, too.
There isn’t really any question that
he is old enough to hold the Presiden-
cy, so what’s the problem?

Even a personage as illustrious as
Alexander Hamilton sluffed over his
age numerous times. One of the
delegates to the Constitutional Con-
vention falsified his age so that he
could appear to be the youngest
delegate.

Those are just drops-in-the-bucket
compared with his sexual indiscre-
tions, I guess, though I fail to see why
they should hurt his political chances
so badly. Gary Hart certainly was no
saint, but he was no more of a
bedroom athlete than past Presi-
dents have been.

Thomas Jefferson, Franklin
Roosevelt and John Kennedy all have
dubious reputations in this area, yet
each is arguably among a list of our
best Presidents.

Hart’s family situation may be
unstable, but Ronald Reagan himself
hasn’t had the most conventional

family life either. After all, he’s a
divorced man (shocking!), and his
children have been publicly rebel-
lious and disgruntled with him.

No one could fault Hart’s domestic
situation as being overly abnormal
for the times. Family life is chang-
ing; why do we expect that our
Presidential candidates’ private
lives should not have changed since
the 1950s?

Besides, what does any of this have
to do with Hart’s ability to be Presi-
dent? Do archaic ideas about morali-
ty and appearances play a bigger
role in picking candidates than
merit?

If so, that is the sad commentary
on American politics apparent from
the Hart disaster.

It’s to be expected that all of the
above issues would have influenced
the eventual vote. Hart had to expect
that, because all together they do
make an interesting commentary on
his character. The shame is that they
played such a huge role so quickly.

It’s a depressing small-mindedness
that will cause enough people to
abandon a candidate for such trivial
surface indiscretions before hearing
his ideas so that even running for the
office becomes futile.

Americans must have been hope-
lessly brainwashed somewhere along
the way if they so easily allow

themselves to fall prey to such ob-
vious abuse of appearances.

The way the press trailed Gary
Hart, and then exposed him as
though they were bounty hunters is a
tad hypocritical as well. After all;
aicn’t they the ones who repeatedly,
complain that President Reagan
plays to appearances instead -
speaking honestly?

The whole situation justreeks’

I thought these attitudes had
changed since Senator Thomas
Eagleton was so senselessly abused
while he was on George McGovern’s
ticket in 1972. I’m very sorry to see
that I was wrong.

American intolerance with Sen.
Eagleton’s minor psychiatric treat-
ment many years before his vice;
presidential candidacy is very
similar to its intolerance with Gary
Hart today.

In both cases, the straws that broke
the candidates’ bucks had very little
to do with their abilities to serve in
their respective offices. What a
waste of good political and leader-
ship talent! Not many really outstan-
ding and qualified potential Presi-
dents are running around these days.
I don’t agree with many of his ideas;
but I really thought that Gary Hart,
was a good prospect.

I’m really disappointed that he’s no
longer a candidate for President. —

To the Editors:

The signs are up again, all over town: ‘‘No Stu-
dent Checks Accepted after May 1.”’ I take those
signs as a personal insult, but I cannot blame the
merchants. My fellow students, past and pre-
sent, are to blame for the shameful reputation
we all have around town for passing cold checks.
Our graduating seniors are the worst culprits,
for many of them apparently feel free to write
worthless check after worthless check, knowing
that they’ll be out of reach of the Cold Check
Committee by the time their checks come back.

When a bank returns a check for insufficient
funds, it is said to have ‘‘dishonored”’ the check.
That should ring a bell in the heads of students
who claim to live by an Honor System. When we
write cold checks, we dishonor ourselves and our
University.

We brag that one benefit of our Honor System
is that students’ checks are accepted all over
town. That boast is patently false. The Honor
System does not shut down on May 1. We can
write checks all over town because the Cold
Check Committee baby-sits us and makes good
when we lie about how much money we have in
our accounts. That’s what we’re doing, by the
way, when we pass a cold check. And it’s not a
little white lie. It’s a felony. Maybe some of us
don’t realize the seriousness of that, because
Dad has always been around to cover for us. But
if we want to be treated as adults here, we’ve got
to start being responsible for ourselves.

We’ve all bounced a check or two through sim-
ple carelessness, but carelessness is not a very
good excuse. Everybody’s checkbook has a place
for keeping a record of how much money is in the
account. If you can subtract, you have no reason
to pass a cold check. If your account is empty,
but you get paid soon, wait till you get paid. It’s
not so hard to wait till you have money before
you spend it. Be a grownup.

The solution to this problem is really very sim-
ple; it’s what would make the Honor System
work, if it did. All we have to do is to start being
honest and responsible. If our Honor System
really worked, that is, if we all lived by it, in-
stead of in fear of it (or in spite of it), we wouldn’t
need a Cold Check Committee. Since that’s ap-
parently not the case, we need to take stern
measures to save our reputation — our honor.
The Executive Committee should immediately
instruct the Cold Check Committee that students
passing cold checks be fined a minimum of $50,
in all but the most trivial or exceptional cases,
and that any student passing a second cold check
in a given academic year be reported to the Ex-
ecutive Committee for a potential honor viola-
tion. The Executive Committee should announce

 

 

to the student body that the deliberate or wanton

(i.e., grossly careless) passing of cold checks is.

both a misrepresentation and a theft, and that
students found guilty of deliberately or wantonly
passing cold checks will be expelled from the
University. Finally, the Executive Committee
should confer with the Board of Trustees as to
remedies against graduating students who pass
cold checks at the end of their last semester. The
remedy that comes most readily to mind is the
withdrawal of such a student’s diploma, retrac-
tion of any letters of recommendation or of good
character, and the threat of legal action against

any such former student who represents himself

as a graduate of Washington and Lee. These

ideas may seem harsh, but our honor is at stake,

in the most basic sense of the word. If we are to
save it, we must prove to the merchants of Lex-
ington and to the thieves and liars among us that

we mean what we say, when we claim to live by a
code of Honor.

ticipate in musical groups.

Although I have at times felt very alone here, I want to thank my
friends (‘‘Pockrass has friends?’’) for giving a damn about me. I once
wrote in a ‘My View” column that “real friends and lovers are not
necessarily the people who are willing to party with you or even go to
bed with you. They are the people who talk to you openly, who listen
with a caring ear, who read what you’ve written just because it’s
yours, who cheer you when you’re down and compliment you when

-

you're up.”

I believe that, and I thank the people who have been real friends, my
| parents included. I thank the people who have been open-minded
enough to accept my religious beliefs, even if my faith differs from
{| most at this conservative, Christian school.

Along with “please” and ‘‘condoms,”’ ‘‘thank you”’ is one of those
magical expressions that make life a little nicer. It’s an almost
mystical experience to go to the drugstore and say, ‘Condoms please.

But since everyone is writing about condoms, and ‘‘please”’ is a
more of a beginning-of-the-year word, it seems fitting to say “thank
you”’ in May to those who have helped brighten one’s college years.

W&L junior makes
visit to Mayflower

From Staff Reports

When Washington and Lee junior
Roger Hildreth celebrated his 2ist
birthday several weeks ago, he
thought he would be without a cake.

“My mom had told me that since
her oven was broken she couldn't
bake a cake for me,”’ he explains.

But Hildreth did get his cake. He
even got a party—although it was not
exactly the sort of celebration
customarily associated with 2ist
birthdays. In this case, the party was
thrown for Hildreth by residents of
the Mayflower, a retirement facility
in Lexington.

Since last fall Hildreth and a band
of fellow W&L students have been
paying regular visits to the May-
flower residents purely on a volun-
teer basis.

“This has been the most successful
volunteer program we've ever had,”
says Kathleen Rogers, the May-
flower’s administrator. ‘“‘And Roger
has been our most faithful volun-
teer.”’

Entirely on his own _ initiative,
Hildreth established the program at
the beginning of the 1986-87 academic
year.

He said he knew life could be dif-

when your sunshine should be bril-

Jackson said on the cool, gray,
almost misty afternoon. ‘‘Hold on,

As he said this, the wind whipped
up, and the Virginia flag on Jack-

his right began waving.

The crowd was made up mostly of
white W&L students, faculty
members and administrators,
although townspeople and Virginia
Military Institute cadets also were
there. W&L classes were abbreviated
to allow students to attend the
speech.

When asked what he thought of
blacks who joined the Republican
Party, Jackson said’ that what was
most important to him was that
everyone registered and voted.

But he also added, ‘The
Democratic Party has the most to of-

Editor's note — The Phi takes
pride in providing a forum for stu-
dent opinion. In an effort to inform
students of the opinions of the ad-
ministration and faculty, the Phi is
sponsoring columns written by
members of the administration and
faculty. We welcome responses from
students.

I very much appreciate the in-
itiatives of the editors of the Phi to
help create new ways for
members of the University to
communicate with each other
about things that matter. Of
course, the letters-to-the-editor
column has always been open and
it has an important role to play. So
do straight news stories and
editorials. But I especially thank
you for creating a new column to
which various members of the
Faculty and administrative staff
can contribute each week over the
course of the year.

I will help to inaugurate this ef-
fort by sharing with you some
general thoughts about the nature
of change and continuity at
Washington and Lee. Change has
been on everyone’s mind lately
and no wonder: there have been
many alterations in our lives over
the past few years, some caused
by forces outside the University
and some initiated within. But
regardless of origin, we have all
had to absorb a great deal of
change and our response, beyond
weariness and the desire for
stability, has partly been shaped
by fear — fear that in the plethora
of new rules, new programs, new
requirements and new people, the
essence of the real Washington
and Lee will be weakened or lost.

 

nizations for a long time,” says
Hildreth, explaining his motives.
“We come into this town for four
years and then we're gone. There is
often a lot of friction between the
W&L students and the townspeople,
and I wanted to work against that.”

Hildreth is no stranger to such pro-
jects. During his high school years in
Bethesda, Md., he assisted with the
Special Olympics program, par-
ticipated in day-care facilities, and
worked with inner-city youth in the
Washington, D.C., area.

Hildreth was, then, a perfect can-
didate to form a service club at W&L.
In September he began to round up
members. Then he contacted the
Mayflower’s administrator to deter-
mine what volunteer work might be
done there to benefit the facility’s 25
residents.

Now each week he and several
other students take time from their
studies and other extracurricular ac-
tivities to spend time at the May-
flower. Sometimes they play bingo or
card games. Sometimes they simply
provide conversation. Hildreth has
even brought along an electronic
keyboard for some musical enter-
tainment. In December he and his
volunteers gave the Mayflower

residents a Christmas party and sang
“The residents

carols with them.

really ate that up,”’ he recalls.

Still in its initial stages, the pro-
gram has attracted only a few volun-
teers. Yet, Hildreth says, ‘‘as smail
as the program is, I think it is having
a big effect on the people there.”’

Hildreth’s effect on the residents
could hardly have been clearer when
they decided to celebrate his birth-
day.

But for now he will be content with
his weekly visits to the Mayflower. ‘‘I

something to look forward to each

heartwarming.”

ministrator: “Roger Hildreth has

many things we have all had to ad-
just to in recent months:

(1) A revised ‘‘core curricu-
lum’’ compelling new students to
take undergraduate courses in
mathematics, English,  ex-
perimental science, literature and
foreign languages, the humanities
etc. This curricula change was ap-
proved by the Faculty early in
1983 but its consequences are only
now being worked out and faculty
positions are being allocated to
alleviate some of the enrollment
shifts it has caused.

(2) The determination by the
Faculty to increase the credit re-
quirements for the baccalaureate
degree from 115 to 121. This was
also approved some four years
ago, but everyone who entered
under the “old calendar’ was
grandfathered. Thus the conse-
quences, especially for spring
term enrollments, have only
recently begun to show up. The
practical effect has been to double
spring term enrollments and we
have been scrambling, with
uneven success, to adjust course
offerings to reflect this new fact.

(3) The shift in Virginia’s drink-
ing age from 18 to 21, with some
students in-between still eligible
to purchase and drink alcohol.
This has had a major impact upon
the way we conduct our social life.
ABC agents supervise every party
and I.D. checks are thorough and
persistent. University-sponsored
parties in the GHQ or in the
Pavilion are much more ‘‘closed”’
than they needed to be just a few
months ago.

(4) The dramatic escalation in
liability cases, especially in mat-
ters arising from illegal alcohol
consumption, has put a heavier-
than-ever burden upon the frater-
nities and upon the University.
The narrowing down of open par-
ties, with freely provided drink for
anyone who cared to come in the

IErom the Hill

Wilson reviews changes and continuities

front door, has been a most un-
popular change. Many see it as
jeopardizing the special spirit of
the University even though its
necessity is grudgingly conceded.
We all recognize that one lawsuit
could wreck the stability of a
given house and place its officers
in long-term jeopardy. Still, it
doesn’t mean we have to like this
new state of affairs or welcome it.

(5) The rise in our applications
for admission since the Board’s
policy change in 1984 has caused
much recent comment, especially
since the publication in a regional
paper (and the Phi) of a super-
ficial article on the admissions
evaluation process. Let me simply
say this: we do indeed now
receive more than twice the
number of applications received
in recent years. But they are
largely coming from the same
schools, the same cities, the same
families, including alumni fami-
lies, which we have counted upon
over the years. Look carefully at
the soccer and lacrosse teams, the
University Chorus, the Phi staff,
the pledges to our fraternities, the
radio station, the Troubadour ac-
tors and actresses. Freshmen and
sophomores are admirably taking
up accustomed places in our co-
curricular and extra-curricular
life. And they are holding their
own in academic courses too. It is
certainly true that with increased
applications for the same few
places, it is harder to gain a place
in the entering class. But the
evaluation criteria are now very
different from those applied in
1973 or 1983. I find it interesting in
this regard to note that freshmen
pledging fraternities has risen
from 62% in 1983 to nearly 80%
this last fall. And 80% is,
historically, the standard index to
Washington and Lee’s fraternity
system.

I could go on in this way to note
still further changes which have

thought it was unfair to label all W&L
students as being of one mindset.

“T’m nota liberal. I’m not a conser-
vative. I’m authentic. I’m genuine,”
Jackson said.

Jackson said the purpose of the
Rainbow Coalition Inc. was ‘‘to build
a new political consensus in this
country.”’ The coaltion is multi-
colored, multi-racial, multi-religious
and multi-talented, Jackson said.

recently come to us. The Fraterni-
ty ‘‘Renaissance’’ movement
spearheaded by the Alumni Fra-
ternity Council and the Board of
Trustees; the coeducation deci-
sion with inevitable alterations in
our perceived patterns of residen-
tial and social life; the advent of
new athletic teams and the place-
ment of men’s lacrosse in Division
III of the NCAA; the appointment
of new members of the Faculty
and administrative staff, espec-
ially the appointment of three new
academic deans and three new
colleagues in the Office of the
Dean of Students. The list seems
endless. And, alas, it will be added
to, especially as senior colleagues
reach retirement age and new,
younger associates come to take
up places here.

But there are continuities too
and these, I think, are far more
important. We are still deeply
committed to the Honor System
and the environment of trust and
decency it fosters. We are still
determined to look after each
other when help is needed. We still
depend for our very soul upon gen-
uine friendships that transcend
the classroom and the undergrad-
uate years. We are still capable of
taking great pride in the Universi-
ty’s academic standards without,
at the same time, taking ourselves
too seriously. And we still enjoy
the very highest level of alumni
loyalty and are much aided by the
generosity which annually comes
to us, unbidden (well, almost un-
bidden), from friends and founda-
tions as well as parents and alum-
ni. These things, I believe, carry
the promise of our future ex-
cellence even as they have
secured this University over all
the years of the past. I think they
will hold us in good stead as we
continue to adjust to other
changes in our corporate life. I
certainly hope so.

Renovations part of capital projects plan

The scaffolding around

Washington Hall recently was a hint
to the renovations being undertaken

on campus as part of a capital pro-
jects plan.

According to Frank Parsons, assis-

chimneys of Washington Hall were

that Hart’s dropping out would not
affect his strategy for the Sour-
thern primary or the overall cam-

He said the critical question
that women must ask as a result
of the Hart affair is what effect
this will have on female credibili-
ty

 

“The presumption is that the
woman does not have the strength
of mind or integrity to make good
judgments.”’ Such an attitude is
demeaning to women, Jackson
said. There already were too few
jobs for women in the campaigns,
and now there are even fewer.

or projects that the buildings and

“the type of project that does not fall
under routine maintenance,”’ Par-
sons said.

An example of routine main-
tenance is the care of the statue of
“Old George’ on top of Washington
Hall. The statue was given a fresh
coat of paint recently.

Parsons said George usually re-
quires repainting once a year.

are bright and charming and
beautiful and tough,” Jackson
said.

This week’s issue of Time
magazine described the Demo-
cratic battlefield as ‘‘a mass of
political Silly Putty’ because of
Hart’s departure from the cam-
paign. ‘Of the seven, only
Jackson has an established na-
tional reputation—yet he has vir-
tually no chance of winning.”’

When asked in the interview
how he responds to such negative
commentary, Jackson simply re-
plied, ‘I don’t.”’

Those sources are tuition and fees,

Lax season
ends in 17-4

loss to Ohio

 

 

By DAVID EMRICH
Sports Editor

 

Last week, the Washington and Lee
lacrosse team turned the tables on
Roanoke—reversing a regular
season loss with a playoff win. This
week, the Ohio Wesleyan Bishops did
the same thing to the Generals,

The Bishops overturned an earlier
12-8 loss at the Generals’ hands with
a 17-4 victory in the semi-finals of the
National Collegiate Athletic Associa-
tion Division III lacrosse tourna-
ment.

“Ohio Wesleyan was a better team
this time,’’ said W&L head coach
Dennis Daly. ‘As their coach [W&L
graduate Mike Pressler] stated after
the game, we were the team that
caused them to reconsider what they
were doing by beating them as handi-
ly as we did (during the regular
season].

“They consolidated their personnel
from around 18 to 20 people down to
13 people playing in a game. They
became a stronger team by reducing
the number of people they were play-
ing.”

Ohio Wesleyan is located in the nor-
thern part of Ohio, about a nine-hour

bus ride from Lexington. The team
split the trip to Delaware, Ohio, leav-
ing Friday about 9 p.m. and stopping
halfway before completing the trip
on Saturday afternoon.

As soon as the members of the
team arrived at their Ohio hotel, they
got changed and held a short prac-
tice. Then it was back to the hotel to
eat dinner and relax before the next
day’s game.

The next morning they ate a buffet
breakfast and watched highlights of
the last two games against Roanoke.
Then, at about 1:30 p.m., the team ar-
rived at Ohio Wesleyan and waited
for the game to begin. The team
seemed relaxed and ready to go.

Soon after the opening faceoff,
however, it was clear that the
Generals were not at their best. The
Bishops scored just 20 seconds into
the game—before W&L had a chance
to set up its defense.

By the end of the first quarter, the
Generals trailed the Bishops by a 4-0
margin. Ohio Wesleyan built a 8-1
lead before the Generals managed to
take advantage of some Ohio Wes-
leyan mistakes to cut the margin to
five, 8-3, but they never got any
closer.

The Bishops shut the Generals out,

W&L scores in the first game against Ohio Wesleyan on Wilson Field.

4-0, in the third period, a quarter in
which the Generals have outscored
their opposition by 40 goals on the
year. Ohio Wesleyan continued its
onslaught, running the final score to
17-4 by the end.

“We were coming off an extremely

high emotional win [against
Roanoke],” said Daly, ‘“‘and maybe
some travel took its toll.

“But for one reason or another,
whereas we were at a very peak state
against Roanoke, we were not at the
same peak state against Ohio Wes-

leyan.”’

Despite the season-ending loss,
however, Daly was pleased with the
Generals’ performance this year.

“The season in general, I thought,
was a great year,” said Daly. ‘I'm

disappointed only in that the seniors
aren’t going out champions.

this team to get to be one of the top
four teams in the country because |
think we definitely were one of the

In doubles, McLeod and Matthews
toppled Hammer and Mark Frisk

mopped up at No. 3 doubles for W&L.

The win set up a semifinal matchup
on Tuesday with fourth-seeded
University of California at Santa
Cruz, which defeated Principia 6-3.
The Sea Lions had not lost a D-III
match all season against some for-
midable competition and were prim-
ed for an upset.

The Generals were up to the task,
though, as they battled to a hard-
earned 5-4 victory. W&L had a 4-2
lead after the singles matches but
had difficulty in the doubles until

match with a two-set win over Mark
Cassell and Jordan Einbinder (ITCA
No. 8).

Kalamazoo reached the finals with
relative ease. The Hornets had little
difficulty with Swarthmore (9-0) on
Monday and rolled over Washington
College (7-2) on Tuesday.

Although all the players performed
well in the tournament, special
recognition should be given to Mat-
thews. Matthews, the ITCA No. 27-
ranked player in the country, went
undefeated over the three days, win-
ning all three of his singles and team-
ing with McLeod to win all three of
his doubles matches.

The individual portion of the cham-

with Haley, Matthews, McLeod and
Mize to participate in the singles
bracket and the tandems of McLeod

The Ring-tum Phi, May 14, 1987

 

By MICHAEL TUGGLE
Entertainment Editor

When you think of films such as
Singing in the Rain, Rocky, The Big
Chill and Top Gun, what do you
remember? Maybe you remember
the dancing, or the fight sequences,
or the story, or the special effects.
There are literally hundreds of things
that could spark your memory, but in
truth there is one thing that stays
with you longer than anything else:
the music. In today’s world of film-
making, a popular soundtrack in the
record stores usually means a
popular film at the theatres. And
nowhere has this been more evident
than in the films released during the
past year. Nearly every film that has
been successful at the box office has
turned out at least one top 40 hit and
an excellent supporting soundtrack.

So, as a kind of “Year in Review”
for movie soundtracks, here are my
five choices for “Soundtrack of the
Year.”

The number five spot belongs to
Little Shop of Horrors. There have
been very few musicals in the history
of stage that have made a successful
transition to film, but Little Shop of
Horrors is one of them. The ’50s doo-
wop style ‘‘Da Doo,” the ballad
“Somewhere That’s Green,’’ the
dynamic duet ‘‘Suddenly Seymour,”
and the Motown numbers “Feed
Me!”’ and ‘‘Mean Green Mother from
Outer Space,” all combine with the
special effects to make this film a
delight. The songs are performed
well, they’re clear, and they’re cat-
chy. Buy this soundtrack and you'll
find yourself singing the songs by the
hour.

Ennio Morricone’s soundtrack for
The Mission is the fourth best sound-

track of the year. Morricone won an
Academy Award nomination for this
score, again proving what a
master he is at composing for film.
Morricone’s title theme, a sweet, yet
haunting melody for the oboe, can be
heard throughout the score in a
series of variations on the main
theme. The vocal pieces ‘‘Ave Maria
Guarani,’’ and ‘“‘Te Deum Guarani,”’
performed by the English ensemble,
London Voices, along with the open-
ing piece, “On Earth As It Is In
Heaven”’ are beautiful. Any lover of
classical music would cherish a copy
of the soundtrack from The Mission.
Its beauty is only outweighed by that
of the film as a whole.

The third best soundtrack of the
year come from what everyone is
calling the year’s finest film The
soundtrack from Platoon mixes both

classical and popular music to
enhance the haunting themes
presented in the film. Barber’s

“Adagio for Strings’ begins and
finishes the soundtrack much in the
solemn way it begins and ends the
film itself. In between the Barber
piece comes songs from the Vietnam
era such as “Tracks of my Tears’’ by
Smokey Robinson, ‘Hello, I Love
You’ from the Doors, ‘‘Respect”’
from Aretha Franklin's early days,
and Otis Redding’s ‘‘Sittin’ on the
Dock of the Bay.’’ The popular selec-
tions for the soundtrack are well
chosen and well put together, but
“Adagio for Strings” is what makes
this soundtrack truly outstanding.
Barber’s music is beautiful, yet in-
credibly haunting, like the relation-
ships that Oliver Stone creates in the
film. Platoon is simply the year’s
finest film all the way around.

Top Gun is the second best sound-
track of the year. Top 40 hits such as
Kenny Loggins’ ‘“‘Danger Zone’’ and
“Playing with the Boys,” along with

‘Stand By Me’ — the year’s best soundtrack.

Loverboy’s ‘‘Heaven in Your Eyes,”’
helped catapult this album to the top
of the charts last summer, and con-
tinue to keep it hot in the record
stores as we close in on this summer.
In addition, Berlin’s ‘Take My
Breath Away” won the Academy
Award for “Best Song” back in Mar-
ch. If there was one soundtrack that
helped make a movie great this year,
it would have to be Top Gun. Every
scene in the film is enhanced and im-
proved by music. Without it, Top Gun
would be just another film.

The soundtrack of the year comes
from my favorite film of last sum-
mer, Stand By Me. Rob Reiner’s
wonderful film chronicling the
adventures of Chris, Gordie, Teddy,
and Vern setting out to find the body
of a missing boy is by all means one

Blake Edwards’ new film, Blind
Date, is like a marathoner who
doubles his pace for the first six
miles of a race. By the time he
reaches the last six miles there is
nothing left.

Blind Date is really funny for the
first 30 minutes. After that, nothing is
funny and everything is cliche. The
plot turns into the same old story,
with the same old ending, with the
same old performances that every
moviegoer has seen a_ thousand
times.

The film is very disappointing; but
then coming from Blake Edwards, a
disappointing film is nothing new.
Not since 10 has Edwards made a
film that had any value at all, and un-
fortunately this film is no different.

For starters, look at the main cast.
In the first male lead, Bruce (Addi-
son-Bruno-Mr. Seagrams) Willis has
shown repeatedly that he is in-
credibly talented and quite funny. So
why give him a repetitive role that
does nothing but run itself into the

State to become a tri

By MICHAEL TUGGLE
Entertainment Editor

 

For those of you who have been
curious as to why the State Theatre
looks more torn apart each time you
see a movie, here is the answer: con-
struction and renovation. Provided
that work stays on schedule, on June
1 the State will be three theatres,
theatres instead of one.

According to Henry W. Flint,
manager of the State and Lyric
R.C. Theatres has decided to re-
novate the State and make it into
a triple. The Baltimore-based com-

   

pany is following the lead of many
major theatre companies, which
have started to convert large old
theatres into multiple film complex-
es. In fact, it seems that grand old
theatres everywhere are destined to
die out slowly; just as the drive-ins
did some years ago.

The construction on the State in-
volves mainly the installation of two
sound-proof walls. One wall will be
installed from the floor of the balcony
to the ceiling, approximately six feet
from the balcony’s edge, and will
separate, the upstairs theatres from
the ones located downstairs. The sec-

Annual

cond wall will then be installed down
the middle of the balcony to split the
upstairs into two smaller theatres.

Once completed, Flint says that the
downstairs theatre will hold between
250 and 265 people, while the two
theatres upstairs will hold 100 and 115
respectively.

One obvious ramification of the
theatre construction is that it will im-
prove film selection in Lexington.

Whether or not a film is held over is
determined by the revenue the
theatre receives for that film on Fri-
day, Saturday and Sunday. If a cer-
tain revenue is not attained, then the

of the five best films of the year. The
film is well cast, well filmed, and
perhaps above all, very well scofed.
The soundtrack is a classic collection
of ’50s hits. “Everyday” by Buddy
Holly, ‘‘Let the Good Times Roll’”’ by
Shirley and Lee, ‘‘Get A Job’”’ by the
Silhouettes, ““‘Yakety Yak’’ by the
Coasters, ‘‘Great Balls of Fire’ by
Jerry Lee Lewis, and of course, the
title track by Ben E. King can all be
found on the Stand By Me collection.
Just as the soundtrack from The Big
Chill was a wonderful representation
of the songs from the ’60s, Stand By
Me is one for the 50s. Enough good
things cannot be said about the score
from this film. If you want an album
that you will always keep and not get
tired of, then get this year’s most
outstanding soundtrack, Stand By Me.
You will be glad you did.

Blind Date is a disaste

ground?

In the female lead, Kim (9%
Weeks) Basinger is unquestionably
one of the most beautiful women in
Hollywood and definitely an up-and-
coming actress. So why dress her
down, make her only relatively pret-
ty, and then stick her into a role that
demands a sexy, seductive woman?

In the second male lead, John
(“Night Court’) Larroquette is, with
maybe the exception of Bill Cosby,
the funniest man on television. His
Dan Fielding role on “Night Court”’
is absolutely hilarious, and very
close to his role in Blind Date; yet his
character in the film never quite
makes it. Why? Because Blake Ed-
wards’ direction of this film is ab-
solutely horrible.

A film about a blind date could be
absolutely hilarious with a decent
director and script writer. Unfor-
tunately, Blind Date has neither. I
feel sorry for Willis, Basinger, and
Larroquette. It must be very dis-
heartening to be talented and have to
perform in the midst of mediocrity.
Sorry guys!

film leaves on Thursday to make way
for a new one. With three theatres,
Flint hopes to be able to keep the
films for a longer period. He said that
the main attraction will be shown
downstairs in the big theatre, while
films from previous weeks or less
popular films will be shown upstairs.
When a film begins to drop in ticket
sales, it will simply move to one of
the small theatres upstairs, prolong-
ing its stay.

“It will be really nice when we
finish,” Flint commented. If all goes
as planned, it will be nice. If I had to
guess though, ticket sales will pro-
bably go up. But who knows? Maybe
the theatres will have discount night
at each theatre on different nights of
the week. You think...? Nah.

Last Saturday Rick Pierce started
a 91-song countdown of the greatest
hits of all time based on the all-time
hits recorded in Billboard magazine,
the requests for songs that WLUR
and other stations have received, and
the influence that the songs had on
the music industry and society at the
time of their release.

After four years of working at the
University radio station, Pierce sees
the countdown as something he can
give to the station, and to the
students of Washington and Lee.

So for the next two Saturday morn-
ings from 9 to 12, Rick Pierce will
bring you the final 60 greatest hits of
all time on Lexington’s finest,
WLUR, 91.5. Here is a listing of the

Reaction to Jackson is constant

 

By TOM BRICKEL
Staff Reporter

 

It may go down in W&L history as
the day donkeys and elephants tussl-
ed on the Front Lawn.

Behind the podium stood the
liberal, idealistic Democrat the Rev.
Jesse Jackson. Listening to his words
was part the of Washington and Lee
student body, a group of students
considered a bastion of conservatism
by many, including themselves.

Jackson’s appearance was the
kickoff for the 1988 Mock Democratic
Convention. Currently a front-runner
in the race for the Democratic
presidential nomination, Jackson
spoke for 40 minutes to a Front Lawn
audience estimated at 2,000.

Student reaction to the speech was
decisive.

Trustees will meet this weekend

By MARGARET PIMBLETT
Staff Reporter

 

At its spring meeting this
weekend, the Washington and Lee
Board of Trustees will attend the
latest production of the University
Theatre, view a collection of
Western art and conduct its
regular business.

The trustees and their spouses
are set to see ‘‘The Ballad of the
Sad Cafe,’ a play based on the
novella by Carson McCullers, Fri-
day night at the University
Theatre.

Earlier that evening they will
attend a reception in honor of the
Stan Kamen Collection of Western
Art, which is on display in the du-
Pont Gallery.

Kamen, a 1949 W&L graduate,
was associated with the William
Morris Agency, the largest and
oldest talent agency in the world.
He displayed the pieces that
became the Kamen Collection in
his Malibu, Calif., home and his
Beverly Hills office.

The collection was bequeathed

realistic,’’ said Dorothy Mills, a
sophomore from White Plains, N.Y.

“It was a moral pep rally, not a
serious political speech,’ com-
mented Craig Davis, a freshman
from Spartanburg, S.C. ‘He con-
tradicted himself several times, the
foremost being his argument that
we've got to ‘take care of our own,’
then going on to talk about taking
care of Nicaragua in the form of
economic aid,” Davis said.

Mark Canon, a_ senior from
Jacksonville, Fla., agreed. ‘‘Not only
did his presentation seem tired, but
his subjects jumped without cohe-
sion. His whole speech was highly
rhetorical.”’

“His platitudes, though mean-
ingless, were delivered effectively,
more so than the ‘Great Com-
municator’ and the Democratic
milksops currently on the political
scene,’ said Erik Curren, a senior

to Washington and Lee following
Kamen’s death in 1986.

Farris Hotchkiss, vice president
for university relations and
secretary to the board of trustees,
said the reception will give the
board the ‘‘opportunity to express
the university’s thanks to the
Kamen family.”

Hotchkiss also said he thought
the evening would entertain while
“at the same time . lallowing.1
the board to recognize that the
university is working very hard on
the center for the performing
arts,’ which is to be built within
the next few years.

Among the regular business
that will be discussed by the board
is the approval of the faculty pro-
motion and tenure appointments,
which have been recommended
by the president’s advisory com-
mittee.

Those recommendations were
the result of departmental sugges-
tions.

from Chicago, home of the Jackson-
founded Operation PUSH.

“For saying nothing, he did it well,
and with spirit,’ Curren added.

When asked what comments they
specifically disagreed with, students
pointed to a number of things.

“His argument regarding the
farmers was off-base,,’ said Damon
Fensterman, a freshman from Lyn-
chburg, Va. ‘“‘Those farmers in trou-
ble are economic individuals who
made a killing in 1979 playing the
economy. Now that the market is
bad, I don’t think an exception should
be made for them.”

“His comments about redis-
tributing the wealth as if people who
made money should be punished for
it were absurd,” said Robert Mould,
a freshman from Columbia, S.C.
“The man who doesn’t work as hard
or work at all shouldn’t receive the
same benefits as the one who does.”

mance, and review of the univer-
sity’s progress with fundraising

includes the Annual Fund, capital

The board of trustees meets
three times a year, once during
each of the academic terms. The
meetings are generally held in
mid-October, late January or ear-
ly February, and late May.

Hotchkiss said that this
weekend’s meeting is ‘‘special to
a certain extent in that it is the
first time the new student body
president meets with the board.”

The members of the old and new
student Executive Committee and
the Interfraternity Council

In addition, the board will meet

Although the Women’s Forum’s
first spring weekend, Confettis, was
deemed a success by those in charge,
the event did run into problems con-

Participation in the weekend’s ac-
tivities was high. Alston Parker,
president of the Women’s Forum,
believes that the entire weekend
went well.

She was “‘very pleased’’ with ticket
sales. A total of 167 tickets were sold

Approximately 60 percent of W&L

a figure,”’ Parker said, ‘“‘but I did not

Although the Women’s Forum has

Parker is sure no profit was made.

Students arrested
on drug charges

 

By SAMUEL FOLEY
Staff Reporter

 

Three Washington and Lee
students were arrested over the
weekend for possession of marijuana
with the intent to distribute, a class 5
felony carrying a punishment of one
to 10 years in prison and a $1,000 fine.

Senior Robert Lutz was arrested
Saturday at approximately 1:30
a.m., and the arrests of senior
William Kubly and junior DuBois
Thompson followed on Monday after-
noon. The three students lived
together at 701 N. Main Street in a
house commonly referred to as
“Fishbait.”’

According to Sgt. G.P. Joines,
about one-half pound of marijuana
was found at the house and was
valued at approximately $450-$500.

One of the things students did like
about Jackson’s speech was his en-
couraging students to register to
vote. In a reference to the Mock
Democratic Convention, Jackson
called unregistered students ‘‘mock
Americans.” He then asked those
who had raised their hands in-
dicating they were not registered to
walk to the podium, where registra-
tion packets were being distributed.

“T loved his. attempt to make
students vote,” said Fensterman.
“As a school that supposedly
educates the soon-to-be political elite
of this country, I was surprised at the
amount of W&L voter apathy.”

Senior Ron Wilhelmsen, one of the
students who approached the
podium, also thought it was a good
move to get people to vote. ‘‘So many

“Tt’s heavy penitentiary time.”’

Commonwealth’s Attorney Eric
Sisler said that the crime can result
in a sentence of one to 10 years in the
penitentiary or 12 months in jail and
up to a $1,000 fine. ‘‘The jury has a lot
of discretion in a case like this,’’ he
said.

This latest series of arrests follows
closely on the heels of the arrests of
two other W&L students, Thomas R.
Pettus and Todd Young. According to
published reports, both of the
students were charged with
distributing MDA, a hallucinogenic

designer drug. MDA is a Schedule I
drug, which means it has no known
medical uses. A conviction for
distributing MDA can carry a prison
sentence of five to 40 years and a fine
of $100,000. Both Pettus and Young
have withdrawn from the university.

According to the rules of the Stu-
dent Conduct Committee, ‘‘posses-
sion with intent to distribute, or
distribution, of an illegal form of an
opiate, amphetamine, hallucinogen,
or cocaine,” or the “‘sale of mari-
juana for profit’ is a major offense.
A major offense can be punished by
expulsion or suspension from the stu-
dent body. In all likelihood those
students arrested this weekend will
have to appear before the SCC.

These two sets of arrests have

Weaver, Krastel win top honors

 

By JIM LAKE
Staff Reporter

Seniors Kevin Weaver and Joe
Krastel captured the top athletic
honors at the Washington and Lee
All-Sports Barbecue and Awards
Ceremony, held yesterday in the
Warner Center.

Weaver received the Preston R.
Brown Memorial Award, presented
annually to the university’s most
valuable senior athlete. A four-year

letter winner in varsity football,
Weaver’s 158 career points make him
the highest scorer in the history of
Washington and Lee football.

Weaver also owns the school
record for the longest run from
scrimmage, an 89-yard carry in his
final game on Wilson Field, and is se-
cond in all-time rushing, with more
than 2,000 career yards. He led the
NCAA in scoring during his junior
year with an average of 13.8 points
per game.

“Kevin has just been a fantastic
performer for us in football for the
four years he’s been with us,”’ said
head football coach Gary Fallon.
“‘He’s going to be a tough young man
to replace.”

Weaver was also a sprinter on both
the indoor and outdoor track teams
for three years and was named to
five all-conference teams.

Krastel was named the recipient of

9:30, and the Connells were only five
songs into their set when the pclice
arrived.

After speaking with Lexington
Police Chief Bruce Beard, Associate
Dean of Students Anne Schroer
disclosed that there had been four
phone calls Saturday night complain-
ing about the music.

‘Apparently, there was a pocket in
town where the music was obnox-
ious,”’ said Schroer. ‘“‘The band must
have carried on the wind.”’

Two phone calls came from
residents of Main Street, and two
others were from _ neighboring
streets, Schroer added.

The Women’s Forum had not ob-
tained a noise permit for the event,
Parker said, because Chief Beard
had told the women such permits
were not issued for events held out-

side Lexington city limits. The
women urged Beard to allow them to
get a permit, but he asserted that it
was unnecessary, Parker said.

The Women’s Forum did send 45
letters out to neighboring residents
notifying them of the possible in-
convenience caused by the volume of
musre. Letters of apology are to
follow.

Although alcohol was served at
some of the weekend’s events, no
school policies were broken, Schroer
said, because “‘the dance was not a
school-sponsored event.’ There were
kegs at Zollman’s Pavilion on Satur-
day afternoon, as well as a tag bar at
Sunnyside that evening.

‘Alcohol was not served per se,”’
explained Parker. ‘‘We knew there
was no way to avoid people bringing
alcohol, so we _ supplied the

bartenders (Saturday night[ to keer
people from running out to their cars
and hurting themselves. We tried tc
avoid a messy situation.”

The dance at Sunnyside was a
private party conducted under an in:
surance policy that was completely
separate from the university. Since
the event was held off campus, it was
further removed from schoo
policies. An individual purchased the
kegs for the party at Zollman’s, anc
that pavilion has its own insurance
policy and is private property.

Plans are already being for
mulated for Confettis ‘88. Because 0}
the noise problems associated witt
this year’s event, the Women’s
Forum is investigating other possible
locations for the dance. The
weekend's events will, however, be
similar to this year’s, Parker said.

‘Older, wiser’ student clerk
defends admissions policy

 

MY VIEW
By Steve Baldridge

 

Can you believe it? All this fuss
over admissions. You’d think some-
one’s mother had been insulted!

What really bothers me is the lack
of intelligent argument behind all the
criticism. If someone could bring out
somethine tangible to show that the
post-coed classes were undermining
the ‘“‘W&L Experience” you’d find an
ally here. Lacking that, let’s cut out
the histrionics.

I applied to W&L and was accepted
into the freshman class of ’82-'83.
Yes, imagine, those golden years of
masculine camaraderie untainted by
female scholars — except for a few
on exchange from the women’s
schools. After a three-year leave-of-
absence I’m back. Older, wiser,
more observant and more involved.
Both years, I have worked as a clerk
in the admissions office. Far from an
expose, I give them my commenda-
tion.

W&L, in that lapse of time, has
seen notable changes. Some in par-
ticular: coed presence reflected in
sports, politics and the performing
arts; beefing up of the sciences; and
heightened conflict between the law
and irresponsible social activities.
But academic competition is intensi-
fying on a national level, in both
public and private schools. Any
school that attempts to attract the
cream of the crop has put itself in a

cc mpetitive market.

The question facing us, then, is
whether this will be a school of
substance or pretense. The trustees
obviously think drama is important
and have allocated $9 million to sup-
port it. But let’s leave posturing and
pretense in the performing arts
center and dedicate the rest of our
time to reality. This is Washington
and Lee University, not the W&L
Youth Club.

Since we are here for an education
and not just good times, let’s
recognize that demonstrated
academic ability is the first quality to
be addressed in the applicant pool.
Wonderful! We find 70 to 80% of our
applicants capable of doing the work
here. So they select. Eyes hungrily
scan file after file searching for
honor-oriented people who have
distinguished themselves by
academic achievement and extra-
curricular activities which will con-
tribute to the ‘‘W&L Experience.”

The task is carried out by people
who take seriously the trust they
have been given. The process is, on
the whole, performed professionally
and meticulously. I can vouch for
that. I have been there. Of course
there’s stress and of course people
laugh and joke. And heaven forbid,
you can sometimes even find a
homemade cake or cookies to be
shared. Birthdays are even cel-
ebrated. Can you imagine?! The ad-
missions staff is human.

But let’s return to the results. Next
year’s class is composed of 64 student
body or class presidents and VP’s, 97
varsity team captains, 84 major club
leaders, 63 newspaper or yearbook

editors, etc. They average 1220 SAT’s :
and th percentile in their class
standing. If you could look at the
folders of people coming, you’d have
to be happy with their caliber and
breadth. That many good applicants
were rejected in a necessary fact of
life. Faced with so many well-
rounded applicants, those who have
demonstrated their excellence in and
out of the classroom are most deserv-
ing of admission. That’s only obvious
and fair.

To those who complain that stan-
dards are rising too high, I reply,
“Piffle.” I researched the mean
SAT’s back through ’61 and found the
five-year average high of 1230 from
63 to 67 with ’65’s being 1251. The
five-year span of lowest mean SAT’s
was from '77 to ’81 at an average of
1131 with '79’s only 1125. There’s still
room to go before anyone has a right
to call “‘outrageous!”’ If you’re in-
timidated by the new arrivals maybe
you should look up a Peer Counselor
to help you accept the reality that
there are people better and worse
than each of us. And realize that
W&L’s higher reputation and stan-
dards will make all of our diplomas
worth more and attract others from
throughout the nation, and hopefully
the world, who are looking for a place
with a tradition of honor and ideals,
not just a good time.

Still unconvinced? Rest assured
that somehow the E.C. chairs always
get filled, albeit at times better oc-
cupied than others. Newspapers are
written, teams play, performances
go on, and guys join frats. These
precedents are remorselessly re-
peated among Wé&Lers although
some would have us think otherwise.

 

Improvements

As the Board of Trustees meets this weekend, many topics
important to the Washington and Lee community will be
discussed. However, there are a few things we think the
board should look at very closely.

Lack of space for both offices and classrooms has become a
major problem. Professors are being shoved into tiny offices
that do not allow them enough room to work in. At the same
time, departments with heavy enrollments, history for exam-
ple, are being forced to hold classes in buildings that house
other deparments . With the increased class sizes that have
come with the revision of the core curriculum and the hiring
of new administration members, something must be done
about overcrowding.

This is a difficult problem for a campus as steeped in
history as Washington and Lee. A new building cannot be ad-
ded to the Colonnade, and the back of campus with its steep
hill, would pose construction difficulties. Also, it would
detract from the closeness and cohesiveness of the campus if
new classrooms were to be built far away, such as the propos-
ed performing arts center.

When the trustees look over physical improvements for the
university, they should keep their eyes open for the many
small things that need to be done, which add up to a large
whole. The interior of the statue of Old George atop Washin-
ton Hall has become a nesting place for birds, certainly not a
dignified function for a historical landmark. The tennis
courts at W&L are completely without lights for night play-
ing, which severely limits time available for students to play,
particularly when the tennis teams are in season. The park-

ing situation on campus is ridiculous; the Corral has become
a too-small piece of asphalt covered with double-parked cars
and trucks parked on the grass, making huge ruts in the land.
The co-op needs to be remodeled, and although this is a
rather large project, it is an important one in light of the
overcrowding occuring in that building.

The list of things that could stand improvement could go
on, but the board can see what else needs to be done, if they
take the time to look. They, as well as the students and facul-
ty, know that W&L is a special place deserving of much atten-
tion and work to keep it that way. It would be a travesty to see
W&L decline in quality because everyone was looking to the
grand projects of the future and not paying attention to the
immediate problems in the present.

(LETTERS

Reader disagrees with Jackson's platform

To the Editors:

Last Wednesday at noon, I joined hundreds of
my fellow students to hear Rev. Jackson speak in
front of Lee Chapel. I’ve never seen so many
idealists in one place, outside of Massachusetts.
‘The question and answer period was especially
amusing, as Jackson skillfully avoided answer-
ing questions not to his liking. Like most of my
fellow students, I was just as interested in hear-
ing what Jackson had to say as I was with seeing
the man in person. Not to my surprise, he
delivered a speech typically Democratic:
nothing new, just the same old misguided gripes
of a crestfallen, liberal idealist, though I was cer-
tainly glad the divestment garbage was mer-
cifully held toa minimum.

Jesse widely misses the mark in several areas
of his cloudy political reasoning. Jesse does not
like what is happening in agriculture today. The
foreclosures and economic plight of the Mid-
western growers are frequently featured in
newspapers and the evening news. Jackson said
that if we can bail out Chrysler and other
American industries, we can help the farmer,
the poor, the unfortunate working man down on
his luck, a victim of Reaganomics. Having
grown up on a large farm and having over half a
brain, I can quickly point out how naive
(especially for a potential candidate) Jackson’s
vision of this issue is. How many farms does one
see being foreclosed in Virginia each year? On
the East Coast? Very few, indeed. Ever wonder
why this is so?

Well what’s the fuss out in Kansas? Many
farmers are truly hard pressed because of fall-
ing prices, from Carter’s grain embargo (nice
move, Jimmy), among other things. But the
great number of farmers in the Midwest, those
now screaming for the help they ‘‘deserve,”’ are
suffering from their own greed. In the mid ’70s,
land was cheap out there, and many farmers
bought more land than they could ever effective-
ly maintain, purchased with easy credit from
reckless bankers in that region. Now, things ain’t
so good, and the ‘‘farmer,”’ who is now no longer
a toiling agriculturalist but a land baron, has to
come up with the dough to pay the frantic banks,
which lent far too much in the first place. We’re
supposed to bail them out? Sure. If everyone in
the electronics business did the same thing,
would the government tell each T.V. store, ‘‘Hey,
you speculated and lost big time, but that’s OK,
we're going to subsidize you?’’ I think not, so
why make an exception for the farmer? Opera-
tors of well-managed farms all across America,
particularly in Virginia, aren’t yelling for sub-
sidies, despite what Dan Rather ‘“‘reports.”’ If
people knew how much the Fed gives in
agricultural price supports as it is now, they’d
ask many more questions. Jackson’s call for help
(and farm votes obviously) is childishly super-
ficial.

Jackson displays his sadly misguided (liberal)
politics most notably regarding Central
America. If he were president, so he told us, he
would pull U.S. troops out of this region, giving
the Soviets free reign to build their base in
Nicaragua, only 1,000 miles from our southern
border. This is sound judgment? Of course not.
Every effort should be made to support and
assist the Contras in their fight against the brutal
Sandinista regime. Nicaragua under the San-
dinista government is a state in which the
military conscripts more young men than any
other Latin American country; in which the na-
tional income is now 40 percent of what it was 10
years ago; in which civil rights have been of-
ficially discarded; in which the native Indians
have been the victims of a genocidal program
launched by President Ortega; in which no, op-
position newspaper is tolerated; in which Cuban
and Soviet military advisors play a prominent
role, and soon.

The Contras are a desperate people, battling
against a tyrannical oppressor for their natural,
human rights, using whatever they can to do so.
We must help them, as friends of democracy and
liberty, which we hold so dearly. I would hate to
see what Ameriea would be like today if the
French had adopted the same policy toward our
fledgling nation i 1779, that American liberals
have shown toward the Contras. We've got a few
things incommon.

Sincerely,
John R. Maass, ’87

APO dunk tank is a success

To the Editors:

On behalf of the Washington and Lee chapter
of the Alpha Phi Omega national coeducational
service fraternity, I would like to thank everyone
who helped with last week’s dunk tank.

Special thanks must go to everyone who
volunteered his or her body for the tank, which
was set up at the Dining Hall cookout on Friday.
And I’ve never seen so many young men stick
their heads out a dorm window to look at a young
lady in a white T-shirt.

Thanks, too, to all the people who tested their
throwing arms. Because of your efforts, we are
donating $75 to the local hospice. We also ap-
preciate the help we received from Rick Norris,
who trucked the tank out here from beautiful
Buena Vista and back.

At this time, I think it’s appropriate to thank
everyone who made this year a successful one
for APO. I would encourage all students who are
interested in making their college years more
full and meaningful to consider joining this
organization.

Sincerely,
Steven F. Pockrass ‘87

Hart caused his own fall?

To the Editors:

In her May 14 ‘‘My View,” Ms. Jennifer Spreng
asks the depressingly naive question ‘‘What’s the
big deal with Gary Hart?” Ms. Spreng adverts to
Hart's “sexual indiscretions,’ but concludes
that Hart’s exit from the campaign is a “larger
bummer,” wondering whether ‘archaic ideas
about morality and appearances play a bigger
role in picking candidates than merit.’’ For
many, however, honesty and fidelity are not ‘‘ar-
chaic ideas’”’ and certainly not irrelevant con-
siderations in the election of perhaps the most
powerful man on earth. Hart himself took what
Ms. Spreng undoubtedly would term an “ar-
chaic”’ position when he agreed that adultery is
immoral (although he did refuse to define
adultery — Hart is a lawyer, and presumably he
refuses to issue a legal opinion before conducting
extensive research). The big deal, Ms. Spreng, is
not Hart’s libido, but his apparent inability to
control it, and what that inability reveals about
his character.

When Hart announced his candidacy, he
chastised the current administration for its
alleged failure to live up to the standards of
honesty and integrity Americans rightfully de-
mand of their public servants. In fact, the cur-

rent Administration is in some trouble because
there is widespread suspicion that its members
have been less than honest about the so-called
Iran-Contra affair. Gary Hart’s candidacy was
mortally wounded by a similar suspicion. No one
cared that Hart changed his name — Hartpence
is an ugly name — but many had difficulty
understanding why he was so evasive about the
name change. No one really cared about his age
— he is obviously younger than Reagan — but it
was revealing that he lied about his age. When he
announced that he was pulling out of the race,
Hart admitted that he has always had trouble
talking about himself. But what hurt Hart was
the suspicion that he had trouble talking honestly
about himself, a suspicion Donna Rice turned in-
toa scandal.

The Miami Herald did not create the image of
Hart as a skirt-chaser; Hart did. Since his days
as George McGovern’s campaign manager, Hart
has had a reputation as a philanderer. One of
Hart’s own aides warned in a Newsweek profile
that there was concern over whether the can-
didate could keep his pants on. Even as he
withdrew from the race, the Washington Post
revealed that it had documented evidence that
Hart had been involved in a long-term affair. So
what? As Ms. Spreng ingenuously asks: ‘“‘[ What
does any of this have to do with Hart’s ability to
be President [sic]?’’ Naturally, Hart’s alleged
philandering has nothing to do with his ability to
lead, but it does offer some evidence of how he
would lead. As noted above, the current ad-
ministration is in trouble because there is a
perception its members have not been honest.
One of the primary character traits voters de-
mand of would-be leaders, especially after Viet-
nam and Watergate, is honesty. If Gary Hart has
routinely committed adultery during 15 years of
public life, I submit that this datum reveals a
great deal about his capacity for deception. Ms.
Spreng may find this exercise an example of
“depressing small-mindedness,”’ but I believe a
candidate’s honesty is a material consideration
in the election of a president.

Cancer Society gives thanks

To the Editor:

On behalf of the American Cancer Society, I
would like to thank the individuals and
businesses who helped make the first
Washington and Lee University Interfraternity
Council Open a tremendous success. Those peo-
ple and businesses who helped with the tourna-
ment are: Grover Smith of the Lexington Golf
and Country Club, Jim Bowen of the East Lex-
ington Store, Jerry Darrell of the W&L Food Ser-
vices, Bob Fitts and the entire Interfraternity
Council, and Pres Brown’s.

The tournament raised more than $600 for the
Cancer Society. With the success we enjoyed this
year, we are hopeful we can sponsor another
such event during the next academic year.

Fourteen points,
condensed to 7

By Steven Pockrass

Although our esteemed Dr. J.D. Futch has described former U.S.
President Woodrow Wilson as a Stauntonian who dealt in the cloudy
cuckooland of idealism, I’d like to chance venturing into the world of
strange birds and present my own version of the 14 Points.

Actually, I’ve only seven points, but my four years here have not
been nearly as bloody as World War I. Rather than fall into what M.
Shaw Pyle might refer to as the ‘‘NelPat syndrome,”’ I'll make my
controversial points — for our own President Wilson and the rest of
y'all — while there’s still a chance to respond.

1) Trust must be improved here. We pride ourselves on our Honor
Code, yet students, faculty and administrators don’t trust each other.
Neither do fraternities. And as Jim Crutchfield noted last week, towns-
people accept our checks not because they trust us, but because they
know Cold Check will pay if we don’t.

2) Once trust is re-established, then dialogue can begin and com-
munications can be strengthened. Students need to know where to turn
when they have problems. We need to know where we can and cannot
post notices. A real campus mail system is a must if we are to improve
communications and save time and money.

3) Fraternity membership needs to be de-emphasized. Twenty-five
years ago, Rush had to be held in the fall because there was no dining
hall, Students had to join houses if they wanted a regular place to eat.
But those days are over. What sort of a message do we send when our
determination of social acceptability is based on cocktail party-type
banter and Animal House-type exploit

Rather than start sororities, which surely will be the downfall of
W&L, let’s see some activities that bring the school together. Then the
Greeks won’t feel the need to support the entire social life of W&L and
the five women’s colleges.

4) We need to open our eyes to the world. Rather than live in isola-
tion, we need to promote the study and understanding of current
events. And we also must learn from the lessons of other schools to im-
prove our own. How have other colleges dealt with the increased
drinking age and other issues facing us?

5) A greater respect for this university must be fostered. Why aren’t
there any history classes — and I’d make them mandatory
—specifically about the lives of Generals Washington and Lee? Why
do we smash beer bottles and throw litter onto a National Historic
Landmark? Why aren't we maintaining the speaking tradition and the
other traditions that once made this school unique?

At the same time, we kid ourselves into believing that myths such as
a student-run campus are traditional here. We fight to maintain
sovereignty, never considering the possibility that a student-run cam-
pus works better with an advisor system, that the two are not mutually
exclusive. After all, if everything needs to be student-run, why do we
have professors and coaches?

6) We must enroll a more diverse student body, as well as encourage
and develop more well-rounded, responsible students. President
Wilson last week asked us to look carefully at the Phi staff, the radio
station and other campus groups. The Phi staff is virtually non-
existent. Although the management of WLUR does an excellent job,
many of the DJs misfile records, if they bother to file them at all.
Records and equipment disappear. If the proof is in the pudding, as
Bill Hartog has said, then we’re not even talking watered down Cost
Cutter here. We students must set an example of excellence. And the
faculty and administration must encourage students to develop
beyond the classroom.

7) Financial responsibility must be improved, both among ad-
ministrators and students. Many questions need to be answered. Why
does Buildings and Grounds seem to have so many supervisors? Why
should I have to call B&G in mid-May to get the heat turned off in my
dorm hall? Why are there a dozen deans? Why must every student pay
$25 a year for a rarely used green airplane hangar? Why are we charg-
ed class dues? At the same time, we need to spend more on campus
security. Other costly but necessary improvements also must be

. made.

If you notice, I’ve included nothing in here about coeducation. Like it
or not, it’s here. It’s a dead issue. It should be viewed neither as a
panacea nor as armageddon. It’s not the women who are letting tradi-
tions die. It’s all of us. Nor is it just the women who could be more well-
rounded. It’s all of us.

Only by striving for improvement can we prevent our school from
backsliding. Resting on our laurels is the same as digging our own
grave. Cuckoo ideas, I know, but then again, democracy still exists in
the United States, doesn’t it?

 

 

DRUGS

[ if Continued from page 1

Unit into the public eye. According to
Sgt. Joines, the Lexington Police
Department, the Rockbridge
Sheriff’s Department and the
Virginia State Police have pulled
together in an effort to curb drug
trafficking and use in the Lexington
and Rockbridge area.

, This is a pilot program which
began Jan. 1,” Joines said, adding
that ‘more is happening in the last
few months than we can keep up
with. We do the best we can.”’

‘ : :

The new program is designed to
facilitate drug investigations. Joines
explained that now if officers in other
departments get information on drug

 

use or distribution, they contact him
directly so the information can be us-
ed promptly and effectively.

If on the other hand he gets infor-
mation that is pertinent to other
departments, there is now someone
he can contact directly.

In addition to sharing information,
the three separate law enforcement
agencies also help each other in the
actual arrest of suspects and the issu-
ing of warrants.

For example, last Friday a war-
rant was iseued to search 701 N. Main
Street. Sgt. Joines, along with Officer
Miller and officers from both the
sheriff's department and the state
police, served the warrant.

Chief Beard has high hopes for the
program. “I think it’s great,’ he
said. “I think it will help us control
drug traffic and usage in the city.”’

 

By LEWIS G. JOHN
Dean of Students

 

I commend the editors of the
Ring-tum Phi for the initiative
they have taken in providing this
column as a source of information
and opinions from various mem-
bers of the administration and
faculty. If indeed there is a ‘‘com-
munications gap’’ on campus, this
is certainly one important way to
help bridge that gap. This weekly
forum should be viewed as part of
an ongoing dialogue on matters of
importance and concern to the en-
tire university community, and
student response is encouraged.

I wish to use the space this week
to talk about the nature and scope
of medical care and health ser-
vices provided students at Wash-
ington and Lee. I do so for several
reasons: (1) A subcommittee of
the Student Health Committee,
chaired by Professor Nye of the
Department of Biology, has been
engaged in a year-long study of
our health services and has made
a number of recommendations for
next year; (2) Students often
grumble in vague ways about
their treatment at the health
center, although we receive very
few specific complaints; (3) Many
colleges across the country are
cutting back drastically on the

FROM THE HILL

health services they provide and
are requiring students to rely
much more extensively on com-
munity medical facilities.
Washington and Lee, I hasten to
add, is not among those institu-
tions.

Unlike many colleges, we do not
charge students a separate health
fee. The cost of our student health
services, as for other services pro-
vided by the university, is includ-
ed in the comprehensive tuition
fee paid by all students. Com-
pared with other institutions of
our size and character, the scope
of our health services is very ex-
tensive indeed. Few colleges or
universities with a student enroll-
ment of under 2,000, for example,
have a 12-bed infirmary, a clinic
which is staffed by registered
nurses 24 hours a day during the
academic year, and physicians’
availability on campus for 17%
hours (to be increased to 20 hours
next year) per week.

On the other hand, students
must have realistic expectations
of what services can be provided.
We assume the obligation to pro-
vide the best possible facilities
and medical services for the
short-term treatment of non-
critical illnesses and injuries, but
we obviously cannot offer a wide
range of specialists and provide
long-term treatment of critical
conditions. Lexington and the sur-

Dean John addresses health care

rounding area offer a number of
specialists, as well as excellent
hospital facilities for a communi-
ty of this size, and we must rely
heavily on them. Beginning next
fall, we will require that each
entering student is covered by
some form of family or individual
health and hospitalization in-
surance to supplement the medi-
cal care provided by Washington,
and Lee.

The Student Health Committee
this year studied various pro-
posals to participate in some form
of agreement with Stonewall
Jackson Hospital whereby hos-
pital personnel and facilities
would be utilized more extensive-
ly for student care. We decided,
however, that for reasons of quali-
ty of care, convenience and cost,
the university should continue to
maintain, support and administer
its own student health center. In
addition, physician hours will be
increased, facilities will be im-
proved to permit greater privacy,
the patient waiting area will be
enlarged, and much more em-
phasis will be placed on a coor-
dinated program of preventive
medicine and wellness education.
We believe that the health service
must go beyond the short-term
treatment of students to play a
more active and creative leader-
ship role in the education of all
members of the university com-

munity on
issues.

With the retirement of Dr. Fed-
deman, Dr. Robert M. Pickral will
assume the directorship of the stu-
dent health center next year. In
past years we have had at least
two university physicians so that
students could exercise freedom
of choice in selecting their doctor.
We shall continue that practice in
1987-88 with the addition of a
female internist, Dr. Jane Horton-
Marcella, as the second university
physician.

important health

In contrast with the trend on
many other campuses, Washing-
ton and Lee is increasing rather
than decreasing tbe level of health
services provided its students.
But we need to hear from mem-
bers of the student body in order
to ensure the highest possible
quality of health care. Let us have
your specific complaints,
criticisms and suggestions. The
Student Health Committee is sup-
posed to serve as a continuing
avenue of communication be-
tween the university health ser-
vice and the student body, but it
was very disappointing this year
when only one student applied for
membership; there are three stu-
dent positions on that committee.
Please use the Student Health
Committee, as well as my office,
to make your views known.

camps and other structures, but they
also spend time praying and sharing
their beliefs.

For the 11 weeks of the program,
the participants are allowed to carry
one duffel bag weighing less than 32
pounds. Because of space and weight
constraints, they may carry no books
other than their Bible, and no music,
even by Christian artists.

The summer begins June 11 with
two weeks of training at Teen Mis-
sions headquarters on Merritt Island,
Fla. This “Boot Camp,” as the par-
ticipants call it, includes classes in
bricklaying and Bible memory, steel-
tying and personal evangelism. For

Anemojanis, as a member of a work
team, boot camp includes physical
training.

Following this intense preparation,
the individual teams travel to their
work sites to spend seven weeks on
their projects.

Anemojanis, who is Greek Or-
thodox, transferred to W&L this year
from Northeastern University in
Boston, where she was president of a
church youth group.

“Leaving a group of 100 Greek Or-
thodox and coming to Lexington
where there are three has been quite
a change,”’ she said.

She added that she has visited
nearly every church in Lexington,
but prefers the non-denominational
Virginia Military Institute chapel.

Anemojanis said she first heard of
Teen Missions from W&L freshman
Cathy Williams, who spent the sum-

wise.”
* Wilhelmsen added, “I didn’t ac-
tually pick up register forms. I was
too busy jockeying for a position in
line to get a picture with Jackson.”
+ Freshman Tina Vandersteel
thought differently about Jackson’s
tegistration request. ‘His attempts
fo make students vote were
ridiculous. In Virginia, you’ve got to
be a resident before you can vote
locally, in spite of his ‘vote where you
live’ message.”’
* According to Mock Democratic
Gonvention media chairman Tim
Bolling, the packets Jackson
distributed did not actually include
negistration forms, but they did con-
tain information on where to
register. The packets also included
information on how to join the Rain-
bow Coalition, Inc., a political coali-
« tion formed by Jackson.

=

‘“‘When the Mock Convention con-
tacted Jackson’s organization
members of the coalition wanted to
give students the opportunity to
register. Unfortunately, Virginia
state law prohibits such public
registration unless permission is
received 10 days in advance, permis-
sion which we didn’t have,” said Boll-
ing.

Bolling estimated that 145 packets
were handed out.

In addition to their reactions to
Jackson’s voter registration drive,
students also had strong opinions
about Jackson’s actual political pro-

spects.

“He’s got maybe a snowball’s
chance in hell of winning, but he
should try all the same,’ said
freshman Terence Wynne of
Westchester, N.Y.

“IT doubt he’d be elected for the ug-
ly fact that America won't vote a
black into the executive office at this
point in time,’’ Curren said.

Mould agreed, adding that ‘‘as
America is currently going through a
conservative stage, chances are that
his liberalism would defeat him.”

Some saw Jackson’s background
as a member of the clergy — he is an
ordained Baptist minister — as a
stumbling block to being an effective
president, though students for the
most part felt it was a minor pro-
blem.

“Being a minister isn’t the pro-
blem. I think being underqualified
is,’’ said Davis. ‘If he had been a
senator as well, that would be dif-
ferent.”

“There might always be the poss-
ibility that he’d make a decision as
an idealogue rather than a pragmati-
cian, which might become a
drawback,’ said Joel Miller, a
sophomore from Sacramento, Calif.

Miller added that as a Southern
Baptist, he recognized similarities
between Jackson’s encouraging
students to ‘‘come on  wn’’ to the
podium and pick ' _ registration

packets, and the end of certain Bap-
tist services where ministers en-
courage worshippers who are not
members of the congregation to
“come on down and join the church.”

“The connection between
Jackson’s speech and the Mock
Democratic Convention was strong,”
said junior Chris Munsey of An-
napolis, Md. ‘Jackson used the event
as a theme throughout his speech,
showing both the Convention and the
school respect in his taking them
seriously.

“Unfortunately, many people
treated his speech as a side-show to
be forgotten,’ Munsey said.

“It’s hard to measure the worth of
a speaker,’’ Mills said. ‘“‘But there
were more people on the Front Lawn
than there have been for any speaker
in recent memory.”’

He added, “‘If it helps students be
more politically aware, that alone
was worth the Mock Democratic Con-

vention’s effort to bring him to
W&L.”

mers of 1983 and 1984 with teams in

“T wouldn’t have traded the sum-
mers for the world,” Williams said,

Williams and Anemojanis will give
a slide show and presentation on the
work of Teen Missions Wednesday at
7 p.m. ata site to be announced later.

The cost of participating in this
summer’s program is $2,000, Anemo-
janis said, which she is responsible
for vaising through sponsorships.

According to information furnished
by Teen Missions, about half of the
cost goes toward airfare and bus ex-
penses. Six percent pays for food, 3.3
percent for buses, 4.4 for surface
travel and 4.8 percent for building
materials. The remainder covers ad-
ministration, publicity and printing
costs.

Anemojanis said she has raised
about $500 so far, including equal
donations from W&L and VMI.

New anti-coed shirts are
a way to pocket money

 

By DANA J. BOLDEN
Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee University
has been coeducational for almost
two years but that hasn’t stopped
some students from displaying their
dissatisfaction with the switch. Tony
Mitchell, a W&L sophomore, has
given students another way to show
their disapproval.

He has created a T-shirt that shows
definite disapproval. On the front it
says ‘Say no to (W&L) crack’’ and
the back displays a picture of a half-
nude woman with a slash (no can do
sign) through her private parts and
the words ‘‘Repeal coeducation.”

When asked where he got the idea,
Mitchell responded: ‘‘Todd (Young)
and I were sitting around one day
drinking some beers and we wanted
to do something to put money in our

pockets, so we decided to sell T-
shirts.’’ Added Mitchell, ‘‘I personal-
ly have nothing against coeducation.
I’m just an entrepreneur; it was
strictly a business venture.”

Mitchell said they have sold about
150 of the shirts, with most of them
being sold during alumni weekend.
“Those guys just ate them up,’’ he
added. According to the creator,
some have been sold to females, from
the women’s colleges and W&L.
“With the shirts, we tried to put a
smile on their (the women) faces,”’
said Mitchell.

He said they plan to order about 150
more of the shirts and sell as many as
they can this year, and the shirts will
be available during matriculation
next year.

Although there are mixed feelings
about the shirts, Mitchell says no one
from the faculty or student body has
expressed any disapproval to him or
Young.

From the team’s perspective, the
national men’s tennis championship
tournament in Salisbury, Md., May
11-17 was a disappointment. From an
individual standpoint, however, the
tournament was an extremely suc-
cessful one.

The Generals had three players
earn all-America honors and head
coach Gary Franke was named Divi-
sion III Coach-of-the-Year by the. In-
tercollegiate Tennis Coaches
Association. Sophomores Bobby Mat-
thews and Robert Haley advanced to
the quarterfinals of the 64-man
singles competition and the tandem
of Matthews and junior David
McLeod reached the semifinal round
of the 32-team doubles bracket.

“The Coach-of-the-Year award
should be considered a team achieve-
ment,’ said Franke. “Players win
those awards for coaches.”

Matthews did not lose a singles or
doubles match throughout the entire
team competition. Returning to ac-
tion after missing the last two weeks
of the season with a broken bone in

 

Haley are all-Americans

his playing hand, Matthews was easi-
ly the Generals’ most consistent
player during the year as he finished
the season with a 21-4 singles record.
Equally impressive was his 22-2
record with McLeod in the doubles.

Haley, a transfer from West Point,
compiled a 17-13 singles record.

W&L will lose only one player to
graduation, Roby Mize, as five of the
six singles flights will return for next
season.

“Roby had an outstanding career
at W&L. He was instrumental in br-
inging a team that finished third in
the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference in his freshman year to se-
cond place in the NCAA’s,” said
Franke. ‘‘He should be proud of that
accomplishment.

“It was a very gratifying season.

The players worked hard and had
some fun.”

Matthews was selected W&L’s
Player-of-the-Year and John Morris
garnered Freshman-of-the-Year
honors. McLeod and junior Chris
Wiman will be captains of next year’s
team as the Generals will once again
be on a quest for that elusive national
championship.

O.K. Check your score. If you
answered ‘‘a”’ or “‘b’’ on any of the
questions you get no points and you
are excused from the rest of this arti-
cle.

If, however, you answered ‘‘c’’ on
all three, you are entitled to attend
the concert of the year, tomorrow
night, when the Student Activities
Board brings you Love Tractor,
Guadalcanal Diary, and Dreams So
Real, in concert at the Student Ac-
tivities Pavilion.

“This is an incredible combina-
tion,”’ said Jim New, S.A.B. opera-

tions director. ‘It should be the best
concert of the year.”

Indeed it should be. Dreams So
Real and Love Tractor are.both com-
ponents of the phenomenal wave of
progressive musicians coming from
the musical megalopolis of the South,
Athens, Ga.

As unlikely as it may seem, this
college town of 40,000 has become the
breeding ground for progressive
music. The B-52’s burst on the scene
first with “The B-52’s’’ and ‘‘Wild
Planet,’’ but were upstaged fast
when R.E.M. got to town. ‘‘Mur-
mur,” “Reckoning” and “Fables of
the Reconstruction” quickly became
what people wanted to hear from
Athens, and while R.E.M.
skyrocketed, other bands struggled.

But this is all slowly beginning to
change. After playing fraternity por-
ches, clubs and college gigs up and
down the East Coast, success is final-
ly beginning to shine down on ‘‘other
bands from Athens.”

R.E.M. moves in new
‘Dead Letter Office’

By GREG UNGER
Music Critic

 

I’m taking only one course this
term, so I find myself with plenty of
time on my hands. Naturally, I’m
spending my spring term pursuing
many worthy endeavors — going to
Goshen, playing golf, and sitting in
the sun on my front porch drinking
cheap beer and pondering the
mysteries of the universe. One great
mystery is whether or not R.E.M.
will ever produce bad (or even
mediocre) music. I highly doubt it.
Indeed, my firm belief in the musical
genius of Athens’ (Ga.) finest re-
mains unshaken after listening to
their new ‘‘Dead Letter Office’ L.P.
The album itself is new, though the
songs are mainly B sides of previous
releases as well as tunes borrowed
from earlier extended plays that had
been available only to radio stations.

P.L.O. starts with “Crazy,’’ a fine
song with the uncanny ability to
make you want to listen to it again
and again — perhaps due to the tune
itself, but I suspect due more to a
return of Michael Stipe’s semi-
undecipherability, reminiscent of
their “Reckoning” L.P. “The Voice
of Harold’ is a clone of ‘Seven
Chinese Brothers,” another track off
“Reckoning,”’ the second of R.E.M.’s

‘Sad Cafe’ opensFriday

By MICHAEL TUGGLE

Entertainment Editor

After meeting Carson McCullers in
Lexington in the early 1960s,
American playwright Edward Albee
adapted her novella ‘‘The Ballad of
the Sad Cafe” for the stage in 1963,
Now, nearly 25 years later, that col-
laboration will again come to life
from May 22 to May 27 on the stage of
Lexington’s Henry Street Playhouse.

“The Ballad of the Sad Cafe”
centers around three misfits caught
up in a triangle of love, power, and
control; yet more than anything, it is
an examination of human character.
Director Joseph Martinez agrees.

“The real genius of Carson Mc-
Cullers,’’ he said, “was that she
understood the very essentials of
human conflict.’’ Nowhere is that
more evident than in this production.

“The Ballad of the Sad Cafe” is an
excellent, powerful drama, yet one
that is quite hard to prepare. With on-
ly six weeks to work with in the
Washington and Lee spring term,
preparation of a production such as
this would seem almost impossible.
However, Joseph Martinez has a uni-
que program that enables him to
undertake major projects each
spring.

Total theatre (Drama 139) is a
course offered in the spring term at
W&L whose central premise is to
create a theatre company patterned
after a professional theatre com-
pany. Students put in a minimum of
eight hours a day, five days a week
doing everything from research, to
production, to building the sets, to ac-
ting. The result: a highly successful,
professional performance of a major
theatrical work, and an educational
experience not found in many under-
graduate or graduate programs in
the country.

While the production is spearhead-
ed by the Drama 139 class, there are
other people who participate as well
Lexington resident Hunter Mohring
plays “‘the perfect Miss Amelia,’ ac
cording to Martinez; while Lexington
High School student Elizabeth Beard
will take on the role of diminutive

six albums. ‘Burning Down’”’ and
“Burning Hell’? are both ‘‘hot”’
songs, roughtly up-tempo and raw,
yet pleasant reminders of R.E.M.’s
younger days.

R.E.M. can still croon slower songs
with the best of them, though, as
evidenced by ‘‘Pale Blue Eyes’’ and
“Femme Fatale,”’ two highlights of a
generally more relaxed second side.
As Stipe says after ‘‘Pale Blue
Eyes,”’ ‘‘that was real good....’’ Yep,
I agree with you, Mike.

The album wraps things up with
‘“Walter’s Theme”’ and a remake of
the classic ‘‘King of the Road.”’ I’m
told that these tracks were recorded
by Mike and the boys after a serious
alcoholic binge. Some background
babbling on both tunes leads me to
suspect that this might be true, yet
still doesn’t tarnish the quality of the
songs. “Dead Letter Office’ is
classic R.E.M. packed with 15 songs
that resemble the ‘“‘Reckoning”’ L.P.
— or even “Chronic Town.” Not sur-
prisingly, all of “‘Chronic Town,”’ the
band’s critically acclaimed mini-
L.P., is included on the compact disk
version.

Athens bands ready to rock

ding to Marler, ‘“‘There’s a definite
understated momentum running
through the music.”’ It’s just the kind
of music you want to listen to over
and over.

Love Tractor will crank up around
10:30 p.m. with cuts off its ‘‘This
Ain’t No Outerspace Ship” LP. This
album, unlike the primarily in-
strumental LPs ‘Around the Bend”
and ‘Til the Cows Come Home,”’ is
full of vocals, eight to be exact. ‘‘We
made the big leap,’’ Love Tractor
guitarist Mark Cline told the ‘“Birm-
ingham News.”

Now that its music has vocals,
however, part of Love Tractor’s uni-
queness is gone, and comparisons to
other Southern bands are likely to
surface. If they do, Cline will take
care of them.

‘*We don’t consider ourselves part
of. that Southern guitar revival
American crap,’’ Cline commented
in a March interview with “Spin”
magazine. ‘“‘The conservativeness of
the old Southern bands gave us
something to react against and the
boredom gave us a space of time to
fill.””

Somewhere around midnight, after
more than two hours of today’s best
progressive music, the “Jamboree”
will begin when Murray Attaway,
Jeff Walls, Rhett Crowe and John
Poe take the stage as Guadalcanal

Diary.

“Rolling Stone’ says of ‘Jam-
boree,” ‘‘...The potential on display
is cause for some celebration,” while
“Billboard” calls the band ‘‘superbly
versatile.” If there was ever a ques-
tion, there isn’t one now.
Guadalcanal Diary is racing toward
the forefront of progressive music,
and it’s almost there.

“Watusi Rodeo” started things off
in the fall of 1983. Then, when ‘‘Walk-
ing in the Shadow of the Big Man’”’
was released a year later, the group
began to get some of the exposure it
had wanted.

A national tour, followed by a
European tour in 1985, further in-
creased Guadalcanal Diary’s
popularity, and suddenly success
was in reach. In May 1985, that suc-
cess finally came in the form of a
recording contract with Elektra
Records, and Guadalcanal was off.

Tomorrow night’s concert could
very well be the biggest concert
Washington and Lee has seen in the
past two years. S.A.B. chairman
Glynn Alexander said “the concert
should be a really big show. The
bands know each other and they are
really looking forward to playing
here.”’

The doors will open tomorrow night
at 8:30 p.m. and tickets will be $5 at
the door.

Trustees make faculty promotions

 

From Staff Reports

 

The Washington and Lee board of
trustees approved several faculty
promotions during its May meeting
last week at the campus.

Five faculty members were pro-
moted from associate professor to
professor. They are: Philip L. Cline,
Craig W. McCaughrin, J.Holt Mer-
chant, Ronald L. Reese and Gordon
P. Spice.

Two faculty members — Wayne M.
Dymacek and Edward O. Henneman
— were promoted from assistant pro-
fessor to associated professor.

Kathy J. Koberstein was promoted
from instructor to assistant pro-
fessor.

A 1967 graduate of W&L in

 

economics, Cline received his M.S.

State University. He served as
research asssociate at the depart-
ment of agricultural economics at
OSU from 1974 to 1975, when he joined
the faculty at W&L. Cline’s areas of
expertise are the principles of
microeconomics and
macroeconomics, elementary ap-
plied statistics, quantitiative models
for adminsitration and economics,
and mathematical economics.

McCaughrin joined the W&L facul-
ty in 1981. He received his B.A.
degree from Wayne State University,
and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from

Law school graduation emphasizes lifelong

 

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Assignments Editor

 

Just when they thought it was safe
to put away their pens and paper,
Washington and Lee University’s law
school graduates were told Sunday
that their examination period had not
yet ended.

Standing on the temporary stage
that had been erected on W&L’s
grassy front lawn, President John D.
Wilson reminded the 114 graduates
and their guests about the upcoming
bar exams. So did Sol Wachtler, chief
judge of the New York Court of Ap-
peals and one of W&L’s most
distinguished alumni.

But Wachtler, who received both
his undergraduate and law degrees
from W&L, as well as an honorary

doctorate in 1981, also told the new
alumni that they would be examined
for the rest of their lives no matter
how hard they tried to escape being
tested.

Workers are scrutinized by their
employers and_ supervisors,
Wachter said. Sole practitioners will
find that the defeated client is one of
the toughest examiners. Judges will
have their rulings overturned by
higher court judges. And even chief
judges of courts-of-last-resort will
find their work cut up and attacked
by dissenters, commentators, jour-
nalists and law-review writers.

Dressed in their traditional black
caps and gowns, some holding
wooden staffs — another W&L tradi-
tion — the graduates listened quietly
on the hot, humid afternoon, as a
rain-threatening breeze occasionally

teaching areas include comparative,
developmental, international, and
Soviet politics, political behavior,
and political analysis.

Merchant received his B.A. degree
from W&L in 1961 and his Ph.D. from
the University of Virinia. He joined
the W&L faculty in 1970. His areas of
interest include American and Afro-
American history, the history of the
federal constitution and the history of
the Civil War and reconstruction.

Reese received his B.A. from Mid-
dlebury College and his Ph.D. from
Johns Hopkins University. He served
as assistant professor of physics at
Bates College and visiting assistant
professor of physics at Worcester
Polytechnic Institute and Pacific
University before joining the W&L
faculty in 1979. Reese’s areas of in-
terest include astronomy, electronics

and general physics.

Spice received his B.A.B. degree
from Toledo University, his B.A. and
M.A. degrees from Ohio State
University and his Ph.D. from the
University of North Carolina. He
joined the faculty at W&L in 1975.
Spice’s teaching areas include
classical and baroque music, the
literature and style of vocal music,
fundamentals of voice production
and introduction to music.

Dymacek received his B.S. and
Ph.D. degrees from irginia
Polytechnic and State University. He
served as a_ cryptanalytic
mathematician for the National
Security Agency from 1978 to 1981,
when he joined the faculty at W&L.
Dymacek’s areas of teaching interest
are real analysis, calculus, discrete
mathematics nad graphtheory.

Henneman received his B.A. from

Yale University and his J.D. from the
Harvard Law School. He served as
an associate with theNew York firms
of Kelley, Drye, Newhall, Maginnes
& Warren adn Winthrop, Stimson,
Putnam & Roberts before being nam-
ed associated director of develop-
ment at W&L in 1972. He remained in
that position until 1978, when he was
named to the W&L faculty. Hen-
neman’s teaching areas include
family law, family wealth transac-
tions and estate planning.

Koberstein received her B.A. from
Carroll College, M.A. from Mid-
dlebury College and Ph.D. from the
University of Wisconsin. She served
as instructor in French at Valparaiso
University and Wofford College
before joining the W&L faculty in
1984. her areas of interest include
French and Spanish, and contem-
porary French literature.

Frat renovation study planned

 

From Staff Reports

 

The Washington and Lee board of
trustees has authorized the universi-
ty to begin the first phase of a major
fraternity house renovation effort.

At its spring meeting held in Lex-
ington on Saturday, the trustees ap-
proved a proposal from their campus
life committee that the university
employ an architectural firm for a
feasibility study of the renovation
project.

In addition, the board has

.. eStablished.an ad hoc committee to

examine possible financing options to
perform the recommended renova-
tions.

The feasibility study will involve
on-site inspections of the university’s
17 fraternity houses in an attempt to
identify needed improvements.

Those inspections, which will begin
this summer, will include such areas
as the heating, electrical and fire
safety systems. The condition of each
of the fraternity houses in relation to
all the other houses will be evaluted.

Among the recommendations that

They all could take consolation in
that they had at least passed this first
test, especially Richard E. Whalen,
of East Hampton, N.Y., who was
awarded the John W. Davis Prize for
the highest cumulative grade point
average.

And although Wachtler — who
started the moot court program at
W&L — talked of tests, he was very
positive about their value. Rather
than speak of examiner as execu-
tioner, Wachtler instead said that the
examiner remains a close companion
who spurs one on to higher
achievements.

Even the U.S. Constitution, which
was written in 90 days and now has
lasted 200 years, is being examined,

feasibility study are for im-
provements in space utilization,
modernized kitchen/during facilities
and renovation living spaces. The
study will include a preliminary cost
estimate for all the recommended
improvements.

“This is a necessary first step in
order to get a better handle on what
we are actually talking about in
terms of renovating the various
houses,” said J. Thomas Touchton,
chairman of the trustees’ campus life
committee. ‘‘We antieipate*ther will
be considerable variance between
the renovations required by some
houses as opposed to others.”’

Once the feasibility study is com-
pleted, the trustees’ ad hoc commit-
tee will be in a better position to con-
sider possible methods of financing
the renovations and repairs. That
committee will work closely with
representatives of the fraternities’
house corporations, which are com-
posed primarily of alumni who are,
in effect, the landlords who rent the

“Those who came before us did
their work well,” Wachtler said.
Because lawyers have been responsi-
ble for much of our present state of
affairs, they must expect to bear at
least an equal responsibility for the
nation’s future.

“That responsibility, I believe,
does not include an acceptance of the
belief that the past has done its work
for the present, and that pure liberty,
which is the cornerstone of
democracy, is forever guaranteed,”’
he said. All of the country’s greatest
documents ‘‘are only words, depen-
dent on each generation te give them
a meaning and significance for our
time.”

Wachtler said he did not know how
the founding fathers would have
viewed such problems as Hudson
River pollution or telephone

student members.

“T think it is important that the
university’s students realize that his
board of trustees is interested in hav-
ing our fraternities play as positive a
role in the total university and Lex-
ington communities as_ possible,”
Touchton said. ‘Authorizing this
feasibility study is one indication of
that interest and this board’s com-
mitment to an overall renaissance of
the Washington and Lee fraternity
system.”

The renaissance movement has
begun on several different fronts. A
committee of the university’s alumni
association has been at work
throughout the year and sponsored a
symposium on the campus last fall
when students, administrators and
alumni discussed several important
topics concerning fraternity life.

Approximately 75 percent oj

are members of fraternities. More
than 225 upperclassmen live in the
fraternity houses each year.

eavesdropping. But he also said that
he did not think the writers of the
Constitution wanted the current
generation of lawyers to interpret
that document without considering
contemporary morality.

He said that the United States had
survived precisely because lawyers
and judges had recognized their
obligation to adapt the law to what
Thomas Jefferson called ‘‘the crises
of human affairs.”

“Time moves quickly,’ Wachtler
concluded, ‘‘and while the present
may seem eternal, all too soon future
generations will be here to appraise
our work as we now appraise the
work of our forebears. When they do,
they will hopefully conclude: This
was our nation, still in its youth, and
that we too passed the test, that we
too did our work well.”’

Lexington blue law issue to be decided in Tuesday vote

 

By MARIE DUNNE
Editorial Page Editor

 

Lexington and Rockbridge voters
will decide if area stores should be
allowed to open on Sundays in a
special vote on Tuesday

Area stores such as Roses and
Maxway began closing on Sundays
starting Jan. 1, after local police
started enforcing the blue law.

The blue law is a Virginia code that
requires stores selling primarily non-
essential items to close on Sundays.
The code contains a provision that
allows localities to repeal its effect in
their area.

According toa story in Lexington’s
News-Gazette last fall, the blue law
was never formally repealed for this
area, even though many stores open-
ed on Sundays anyway. One com-
plaint was all it would take to make
this the police enforce the laws, said
the article.

Acity merchant subsequently com-
plained and the police began to en
force the law at the beginning of 1987

ee ete rere

Several merchants from Lexington
and Rockbridge then formed an in-
formal committee to see about get-
ting the law repealed. According to
Brian Shaw, a member of the com-
mittee, a petition signed by 10 per-
cent of registered voters was needed
to schedule a special vote on the law.
There must also be 60 days’ public
notice before any vote.

June 2 was selected for the vote
because ‘‘that was about the earliest
we could do it,”’ said Shaw.

The News-Gazette has received
many letters to the editor on the Sun-
day closings. Local residents and
businesses seem divided on the issue.

One group favoring the enforce-

ment of blue laws calls _ itself
“Citizens Against Sunday Open-
ings.’’ Gene Williams, manager of
the Lexington Leggett store and
chairman of “Citizens Against Sun
day Openings,’’ was out of town this
week and could not be reached for
comment. The group’s treasurer,
Bryan McFadden, who also works for
Leggett, said, ‘I really have no com
ment to make.’

The committee of merchants in
favor of Sunday openings has launch-
ed a publicity campaign, complete
with bumperstickers and buttons,
calling for the repeal of the blue laws.
The group will have full-page ads in
area papers and run radio ads on
Lexington’s two area_ stations,
WREL and WVLI, according to
Shaw. Roses produced and paid for
large blue-and-white posters that are
hanging in business’ windows.

“We don’t perceive the blue laws
as a religious issue, but an issue of
freedom, freedom to shop on Sun-
days,”’ said Shaw.

Frances Ruley, an employee of
Maxway and member of the commit-
tee, agrees. If a merchant wants to
open on Sundays ‘‘that merchant
should have the freedom of choice,”
said Ruley.

Even local businesses that do not
have to close on Sunday are concern-
ed the law will cause them to lose
revenue.

“What it affects is really what we
can offer in the area as far as our
guests are concerned. We have

weekend guests that come to see the
historical sites in the area, and it’s a
major inconvenience for them not to
be able to shop on Sundays,”’ said
Sandra Hatter, general manager of
Days Inn.

Many of those who support the blue
laws say the county is losing money
by holding a special vote. The elec-
tion will cost less than $10,000 total,
$1,500 for the city and about $7,000 for
the county. Although no estimates
are available, many people feel the
cost of the election is ‘‘just a drop in
the bucket’’ compared to the revenue
already lost from Sunday closings,
according to Maxway manager
Barry Guffy.

“In sales per hour, Sunday (was)
our best day,’’ said Guffy.

A major argument for Sunday clos
ings is that they allow employees to
spend time with their families.

“Tf any employee needs to get off to
their mother or grandmother or
relative, all they have to do is ask,”’
said Guffy, who cited that 90 percent
of Maxway employees are willing to
work on Sundays.

Pat Richardson, senior assistant
merchandizing manager for Roses,
said, “I think basically (the
employees) are supportive of
(repealing the blue law) because it
means extra money for them. They
get paid time and a half on Sundays.
There are always going to be two or
three (who don’t want to work), but
we're not forcing anybody to work on
Sundays. It’s all on a volunteer basis.
We've always had enough people
volunteer without having to draft
anybody.”’

As for the vote this Tuesday, Shaw
said the group of merchants favoring
Sunday openings is ‘cautiously op-
timistic” that the voters will repeal
the blue law. The group is concerned,
however, that voters don’t assume
that support is so strong that the law
will be repealed without their vote

Hatter of Days Inn favors the
repeal of the blue law but says she is
not sure how the vote will turn out.
“because my feeling is that the peo-
ple who are against it are more likely
to go out and vote, rather than the
people who are for it.”’

One more milk
for the road

By Steven Pockrass

So there we were, once again sitting in the old milk bar, downing a
few smoothies during The Final Days.

Then it happened. The question every senior is sick and tired of
hearing: ‘‘So do you know what you’re going to do next year?”

We all hate having to answer that query, yet like some sort of
sadistic cult, we ask each other anyway. Yes, yes, yes dammit! I’ve
got a reporting job. Well, at least through the end of August, but it
might become full-time. And if not? Well, I’m sure I’ll be doing
something. At least drinking milk and chasing chicks on the beach, if

nothing else.

But seriously, folks, what if you really DON’T KNOW what you're
going to be doing next year? Sure, that W&L degree probably qualifies
you to fish out burgers at the local greasy-spoon laundromat. But what
if you want something better?

Well, have I got a deal for you, a bargain you can’t refuse. Now it’s a
well-known fact that we J-types devote our lives to writing, while you
pre-meds, pre-laws, and C-Schoolers devote your lives to mak-
ing money. So let me write about just a few entrepreneurial ideas that
have been floating around in my head and let you take all the credit.

My own favorite is a senior button kit that would answer the dreaded
question. Selections might include: ‘Yes, I’m A Senior; No, I don’t
Have A Job,” Unemployed But Looking,” “Unemployed But Begg-
ing,” “Unemployed But Groveling,” or perhaps simply “DON’T
ASK!”’

For you cuisinary chemists, why not invent a machine that would
put all the sugar and caffeine back into diet sodas when all the real
soda runs out? Or manufacture a fruit juice with 10 percent real soft
drink in it. How about a ‘dorm counselor’s coffee cup” for continental
breakfast, about six inches wide and 12 inches deep?

For you key-punches, let’s see a computer with a ‘‘you-know”’ button
on it. (Source — Ham Smith). That’s the button you push when you
know what you want to do and you want the computer to know it too.

If you’re a back-to-nature type who lives in New York City, why not
develop a ‘‘Make-your-own condom”’ kit? Or how about a home AIDS
test? I can see the ads already. ‘‘Now, in the privacy and comfort of
your own home, you too can find out if you’re one of the millions of
unlucky Americans ....”’

And although I’ve never actually worn a pair of women’s shoes, it’s
always been my contention that the most-loved man in the world will
be the one who invents a good-looking, comfortable pair of women’s
shoes. I’ve seen too many women walking to work in tennis shoes and
watched too many women take their shoes off behind their desks to re-
main blind to the fact that the female shoe market is just waiting to be
conquered.

And what was I doing looking at women’s legs behind their desks,
you may ask. Well, I’d like to tell you but I’m afraid we’ve run out of

I have one paper left to write; I’ve
read the last book, my thesis is hand-
ed in, and I’ve completed my P.E. re-
quirement. All that’s standing bet-
ween me and a diploma is this 15-
page paper, which, I suppose, | will
somehow find the motivation to
finish. After four years we are truly
on the home stretch. I even watched
the law students graduate today just
to get prepped for mine.

Naturally enough, as I get ready to
step across that chasm of the
bachelor’s degree into my futnre of
Reality (and unemployment) I’ve
been doing a lot of thinking about
what this place means to me. This
then is what you’ve dreaded all year
—that ‘‘A Senior Looks Back’’ end-of-
the-year essay with the lamentations
of not having done all that he set out
to do and original comments like
“*You get out of this place what you
put into it!” Well, I'll try not to be
quite that trite.

Four years is a long time, and the
class of 1987 has been through a lot in
those years — everything from
changes in the drinking laws and
coeducation to dealing with all-

‘ 00K ANY YOUNGER...
FouR YEARS AND $40,000 LATER, HE STILL DIDN'T 100 G

talize them — too bad, ’cause here I
go.
For starters there are the room-
mates. I’ve had a new one every year
— you want to talk memories!
Freshman year I lived in the only tri-
ple at W&L with John and Allison. I’d
love to give him a hard time about
how he never had to do laundry for
himself, but then Allison was always
nice to me and would sew buttons
back on my shirts, so I'll just give
‘em best wishes. Then there were
Pete and Woods Creek. We weren't
sure we’d make it through the year
what with the three other crazies
(literally) we lived with, but
sémehow we made it, Pete living on
yogurt (how much money did you
spend on that girl at F.D., Pete?),
and I on fried bologna. Then last year
as I made my one foray into the class
of ’86, there was Bart, the only person
I’ve ever known who could cook
sweet-and-sour pork while discussing
Mozart in Russian and painting a
German countryside in oils. Finally
this year, one of my oldest friends
from freshman year, the self-styled
genetic mutant with no lungs and no

for a year!

Then there’s the gang in the Glee
Club and University Chorus. Five
foreign countries and four years
later, I still have more fun with this
group than just about anyone. An-
drew, Christie, Kristen, Jim, Davids,
and Tom — keep up the good work,
have a blast in England, and drink a
few pints of bitter for me. My life has
revolved around those rehearsals,
concerts in the Chapel and tours, and
I’m really going to miss them and
you.

I think one of the things which is
most unique about W&L is that some
of the best friends we make are with
the faculty. I have enjoyed getting to
know nearly all my professors, and
wish I could have gotten to know
many of them better. But two pro-
fessors stand out in my mind as peo-
ple who have really been important
to me. Professor Craun of the
English Department has given me
more than my fair share of good ad-
vice over the years and I only hope
that when I have students of my own

nighters and the Cold Checkplace, time for anything non-logical except some day I will take the time and-
but not all of us are fortunate enough a pizza, Mark. Hats off to all of you concern over them that he has over
to have a column in which to immor- _ for lots of fun and putting up with me

Club and Chorus has probably been
the biggest constant in my W&L
career; ‘‘Doc’’ manages always to
combine work and _ pleasure,
resulting in witty lectures and fun yet
productive rehearsals. I can’t im-
agine not being able to walk into his
office at 9:00 to ask just one question
and leave at 10:30 — only to realize
that I forgot to ask him my question.
And more often than not there was no
question to begin with. These two are
what W&L is all about, and I’m glad
to have known them, and more im-
portantly, to have had them as
friends.

From the (illegal) Halloween Hall
Crawl freshman year to the road trip
up to Ohio Wesleyan two weeks ago,
these past few years have been a lot
of memories. But what makes these
memories is people. W&L has some
great people — students and faculty
— and I think they, more than
anything else, make this place
special. To my classmates I say good
luck guys, it’s been a great four
years. And to those who still have
some time left in Lexington, I hope
you leave here with the memories
and the friends that the class of '87
has. And now I suppose I better get

space in this week’s Phi, and besides, it’s time for another milk,
perhaps with a little Strawberry Quik in it. Now there was an inven-
tion.

I know we're out of space, but one quick thought: As you make but-
tloads of bucks off these great ideas, remember me, okay? Checks will
be accepted. Have a good life.

 

 

 

Positive

One criticism that is often leveled at the Ring-tum Phi is
that the paper dwells too often on the negative. Why don’t you
ever write about all the good things that happen at
Washington and Lee, people ask.

Well, Wednesday evening was our chance to celebrate
what’s good about our university. The Ring-tum Phi
presented its annual awards to five individuals who have
made outstanding contributions to the Washington and Lee
community.

Carol Ann Calkins, Jeffery G. Hanna, David W. Sprunt,
Brandt Surgner and Rob Vienneau have all gone above and
beyond the call of duty in their service to their university.
They should serve as an example to all of us.

Of course, there are countless other students, faculty and
administrators who have contributed much to W&L
(including Jefferson Davis Futch and Shayam Menon, who
received the Pusey and Gilliam Awards, respectively, from
‘he Executive Committee Wednesday night).

And there are many others, far too numerous to name in
his limited space. What about the Calyx staff members, who
spend long sleepless nights trying to meet an impossible
leadline? What about the students who drag themselves out
of bed at 6 a.m. to host ‘‘Morning Magazine” on WLUR?

Or how about the members of Contact, who work out the
ndless details necessary to bring nationally known speakers
o the campus? Or the SAB and the Student Telephone Union,
he Mock Convention and the Glee Club? The list goes on and
m

These are the people who make Washington and Lee
pecial. And although we can’t present them all with engrav-
d awards, every, once in a while we ought to sit back and
ive them our thanks.

The editorial cartoon printed in last week’s

poor taste. The residents of Fishbait have not

They deserve more than to be publicly
humiliated and convicted by the campus
newspaper. What useful comment were you
struggling to make by printing that cartoon?
Your cartoon showed not only a serious breach of
trust, but a lamentable lack of style. Is that your
version of satire? Other students have been
charged with similar crimes, was there any par-

openly condemning a group of our fellow

Thanks to everyone

To the Washington and Lee University
Community:

I just wanted to write a quick note and say how
much I have enjoyed interning at W&L this
semester. Everyone with whom I have worked
has been extremely friendly and helpful.

From the fraternities to the residence staff to
the deans and staff, I have been impressed with
everyone’s concern for excellence, both
academically and personally. My realm of pro-
fessional experience has increased immensely
since my stay here.

Thank you again for a great semester and my
hope is that Washington and Lee continues to
reign as one of the premier academic institutions
of the South.

Cartoon is ‘irresponsible’
‘Lu ihe Editors:

Last week’s editorial page cartoon fails far
short of any semblance of humor. The irresponsi-
ble journalistic practices of the cartoonist;
editorial page editor, Marie Dunne; and of the
Ring-tum Phi’s editorial staff as a whole have
once again been clearly illustrated by the prin-
ting of this ‘“‘humorous”’ cartoon. In my opinion,
this was not only an unethical but also a
dishonorable act, although I am defining
“honor’’ here a bit more broadly than simply as
abstinence from lying, cheating, and stealing.

As for myself, the printing of this insulting car-
toon served to destroy the last shred of respect
which I held for your feeble attempts at jour-
nalism which you continue to try to pass as an
ethical, responsible and unbiased school
newspaper.

The unnecessarily malicious nature of the
caricature is further illustrated by the idiotic let-
tering of the ‘‘sign” and the ridiculous depiction
of “a young W&L student.’ (Messrs. Lutz and

 

Kubly are both seniors and Mr. Thompson is a

junior, hardly ‘‘young” W&L students. )

Why did you choose to assault these
gentlemen? There have been much more serious
drug arrests made against which there was no
similar edict issued from the apparently morally
superior editorial department of the Ring-tum
Phi. Are there other reasons for this unnecessary
attack of which we are ignorant?

Finally, it is my belief that a formal apology
should be issued not only to Messrs. Lutz, Kubly
and Thompson, but also to the entire Washington
and Lee community whose intelligence has once
again been insulted by the kind of irresponsible
journalism which has characterized the Ring-
tum Phi all year long.

If you are aspiring to be responsible, credible
journalists, then you are on the wrong track.

Bruce D. Partington ‘87

Smith on Jackson

To the Editors:

In response to ‘Reader Disagrees with
Jackson’s Platform,’ I disagree with Mr.
Maass’s assertion that Presidential hopeful
Jesse Jackson displayed ‘‘sadly misguided
(liberal) politics,” vis-a-vis the American role in
Central America. Of all the Presidential can-
didates thus far, I believe that Jackson has main-
tained the most reasonable position, urging a
cessation of military operations, and a return to
negotiations buttressed with a commitment for
economic aid.

Notwithstanding the fact that American policy
in Central America is riddled with inconsistency,
arms scandals, and an incompetent President
who tries to moralize the Contra-cause by com-
paring them, most shamefully, to our Founding
Fathers; reality dictates that America not get in-
volved, at least not militarily. To take the com-
parison that Mr. Maass develops when he writes,
“T would hate to see what America would be like
today if the French had adopted the same policy
(non-involvement) toward our fledgling nation in
1779,” I would pose this question to Mr. Maass
—Did the French send in official troops to win
the war for us? Yet this is what the U.S. has
begun to do with a troop infiltration of Honduras
in the number of 1,400 troops. These American
troops have begun a commitment to Honduras,
and to the Contras, at a time when the U.S. has
no defined strategic goals in the area. And if they
have been defined (i.e. in the Pentagon ex-
clusively) then they have yet to be presented to
the American people to be embraced or rejected.

Why is involvement of the American people so
important? Consider this quote by Colonel Harry
Summers in his book ‘“‘On Strategy: The Viet-
nam War in Context,” printed by the Army War
College: ‘The failure to invoke the national will
was one of the major strategic failures of the
Vietnam War. It produced a strategic vulnera-
bility that our enemy was able to exploit.’’
Besides those various wealthy individuals who
have illegally contributed to the contra-scam
fund, there has been no indication of national will
in terms of America’s role in Central America.

Nevertheless, the administration has commit-
ted itself and the country to the Contra-cause

plagued by lack of direction, lack of any better
alternative government, lack of international
support, and finally and most importantly —lack
of any moral imperative. Basically, we have
committed ourselves in a very undemocratic
way, toa group of terrorists, coming from an old
tradition of terrorists and high-handed despots.
Their aim is to topple the present authoritarian
left-wing regime, and establish their own
authoritaria right-wing regime (even conser-
vatives agree on this one). The net benefits,
however, do not outweigh the costs involved, the
many young American lives that will be shed for
no real benefit. Yes, Mr. Maass, I do agree with
Mr. Jackson when we say something has gone
awry; in this case, the way in which America in-
volves herself abroad militarily. One drop of
American blood shed in that region, is one drop
too many.

Caruthers thanks Menon
To the Editors:

As a W&L student I wanted to write and thank
Shayam Menon for serving as President of the
Student Body this year. The job is an extremely
demanding and time-consuming one, and it can
detract greatly from a senior’s final year at
W&L. Nevertheless, Shayam has exemplified the
ultimate in commitment and dedication to the
University. In fact, his zealousness during his
three years on the Executive Committee, as well
as simply all four years here at W&L, has been
contagious.

Over the past year, he has dutifully expressed
student opinion to the faculty, administration,
and Board of Trustees in an impressive and ef-
fective manner, while at the same time eliciting
nothing but respect from all parties — something
which is rare. I take this time to toot his horn for
fear his service to the W&L Student Body will go
unappreciated. He has commanded the entire
E.C.’s respect and admiration. I want to thank
him for a job — and a W&L career — well done.

Diversity, Variety needed for school activities

NEWS ANALYSIS

 

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Assignments Editor

 

Does Washington and Lee provide
a wide enough variety of student ac-
tivities? Not according to some of the
people who are responsible for stu-
dent activities at W&L.

Student activities take many forms
here: fraternity functions, film socie-
ty films, athletic club contests and
others. Although the fraternities are
funded by student dues, almost all
the other organizations receive stu-
dent tax money allocated by the stu-
dent Executive Committee. Each
student pays $100 a year in student
taxes, $25 of which goes to pay for the
Student Activities Pavilion.

Far and away, the organization
that receives the greatest portion of
the tax money is the Student Ac-
tivities Board, which this year
received $46,000 out of a total of
$133,650.

The purpose of this article is to
reflect the thoughts of some of those
people who help make decisions
about the diversity of activities here
at W&L.

THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES

The board of trustees is the
ultimate custodian of all aspects of
campus lifé'at W&L, according to J.
Thomas Touchton, head of the
board’s campus life committee. The
board doesn’t make many specific
recommendations about day-to-day

The Campus Life Committee was
formed when the trustees began
discussing coeducation’ Its purpose
was ‘‘to seek to determine, from a

Washington and Lee might change if
W&L became coed,”’ Touchton said.
The committee continues to function
as a monitor of campus life.

He said that it’s always been im-

John said he goes to many
meetings, especially to discuss pro-
gramming under the new drinking
laws. ‘‘We obviously need to come up

focus.”

THE SAB

Glynn M. Alexander Jr., head of
the SAB, said he too would like to see :
more diversity inthe programming. -

But that’s easier said than done.
Although he was executive director
of the SAB last year, he said it took
him until January just to feel comfor-
table with what he was doing. He said
it’s very easy to get in a rut and
decide to stick with the standard
forms of entertainment.

Alexander said it is hard to get a
wide variety of music at a small, out-
of-the-way school because “working
with one date is really hell.’”’ Other
colleges have bands on weekdays.
They put on shows for the whole
school, but they don’t expect the
whole school to attend.

The SAB used to show movies, but
“the interest for that just plum-
meted,’’ Alexander said. It’s become
much more feasible for a student to
go to a video store and watch movies
at home ona VCR.

Like Atkins, Alexander said he
thought the SAB should try to have
more activities that are relatively in-
expensive and would provide enter-
tainment for smaller groups. The
SAB shouldn’t be afraid of failing,
and the students shouldn’t be afraid
to try something new.

‘You at least try something once,”’
he said.

Seniors key

track team’s
winning years

 

 

By JIM LAKE
Staff Reporter

 

For five W&L seniors, four years of
track competition at Washington and
Lee have brought nothing but suc-
cess.

Since coming to W&L in the fall of
1983, Ash Andrews, John Burl-
ingame, Tom Murray, John Carder
and Matthew Steilberg have spent
most of their afternoons from
January through April trying to run a
little faster, throw a little farther,
and jump a little higher.

And, for each of them, the hard
work has paid off.

“This group of seniors we have has
just had phenomenal success since
they’ve been here,” said head track
coach Norris Aldridge. ‘‘They have
not lost a dual-, tri-, or quad-meet [in
four indoor and four outdoor seasons
and ] have won six of the eight titles
that it was possible for them to win.”’

Since 1984, W&L track teams have
not lost a single regular-season meet,
compiling a 27-0 record, and have
placed no lower than second in eight
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
Championship meets, winning all but
two of those contests.

A four-year letter-winner in cross
country, Andrews is an economics
major from Floyds Knobs, Ind. “He
did an excellent job’ competing in
distance events in a conference that
“has always had outstanding
distance runners,’’ said Aldridge.

Burlingame, an economics major
from Metairie, La. was the ODAC in-
door long jump champion in 1986 and
1987 and missed first place by haif an

inch in 1985. Burlingame also ran the
400 meters and was on W&L’s con-
ference champion 400-meter relay
team in the 1987 indoor season. Un-
fortunately, a recurring hamstring
injury kept Burlingame from com-
peting for conference championships
outdoors in 1985, 1986 and 1987.

The ODAC and school record-
holder in the shot put, Murray was
the conference champion in that
event indoors in 1986 and 1987 and
outdoors in 1985 and 1987. He was
presented the Captains’ and Coaches’
Trophy for dedication and loyalty at
last week’s All-Sports Barbecue.
Murray, also an economics major, is
from Princeton, N.J.

Steilberg won the ODAC pole vault
title indoors in 1985 and outdoors in
1986. An English major from Rich-
mond, he also performed well this
year, clearing 13 feet and taking
third place at the ODAC indoor meet
and second at the outdoor meet.

In 1987, Carder took over as the
Generals’ leading vaulter. The
chemistry major from Roanoke
finished second in the indoor pole
vault and was the conference cham-
pion in that event for the outdoor
season.

Although they did not run as
freshmen, Aldridge commended
three-year letter-winners Kevin
Weaver, who ran on five ODAC
championship relay teams, and
Steve Pockrass, who ran cross coun-
try for four years and was a
wrestler during his freshman year.

“The seniors are really to be con-
gratulated for their effort,’ said

Aldridge. ‘‘We’ll really miss then Boyd, Tom Murray, Ash Andrews, Steve Pockrass, John Burl-

next year.”’

When Jefferson Harralson ar-
rived at Washington and Lee
University for his freshman year,
he was six feet, four inches tall
and barely earned a varsity letter
for playing basketball. By the
time he finished his senior season,
he had grown to his present height
of 6’ 6” and had scored 1,219
career points, placing him 11th on
the all-time career scoring list. It
is for his incredible final season
that Jefferson Harralson has been
chosen as the Phi’s Athlete-of-the-
Year.

Check out the numbers. Har-
ralson scored 524 points (a 21.0 per
game), grabbed 198 rebounds
(7.8) and dashed off 48 assists
(1.9). He led the team in scoring in
19 of the Generals’ 25 games and
in rebounding in 17 contests. He
connected on 172 out of 330 field-
goal attempts (52.1 percent) and
nailed 147 out of 198 free throws
(74.2 percent). And finally, Har-
ralson was named to the first
team all-Old Dominion Athletic
Conference squad, was named to
tne all-South Region basketball

team by the National Association
of Basketball Coaches and was an

honorable mention all-American
in Division III basketball.

But it was on Jan. 27, 1987, when
Harralson entered the W&L
record books. With exactly 10:52
remaining in the first half of an
away game versus Hampden-
Sydney, Harralson buried a 10-
foot jumper for his 999th and
1,000th career points.

“TI kind of expected it,” said
Harralson of reaching the
milestone. “If I didn’t get it, I
would have been disappointed. I
guess when I look back it will be
more of an accomplishment.”

What can be viewed as a major
accomplishment is the way Har-
ralson’s game has progressed
through his four years on the court
here at W&L. Harralson, who
began playing basketball in
Princeton, Ky. when he was eight
years old, was a member of the
Generals’ squad during his
freshman year. But ‘‘member’”’ is
about all you could call him.

“T had no idea what to expect in
Division III,” he said, “‘There are
no Division III schools in the area
I’m from.

“But I went to the gym to play
and I saw a bunch of slow, white
dudes. I said to myself, ‘I think I
can play with these guys.’”’

Playing behind three other

 

freshmen, however, Harralson
saw precious little playing time
and even considered quitting the
team. He decided to stick it out
one more year and, after the fifth
game of his sophomore season, he
had earned a starting position.
With that hurdle cleared, Har-
ralson turned his attention to scor-
ing more points.

“T didn’t think I had to [score a
lot of points],’’ he said, ‘“‘but coach
{Canfield] felt I should step to the
forefront. I always played better
as acomplementary player.

“By my senior season,” he said,
“T felt like I was the guy that had
toscore.”’

But, although he attained his
achievements by himself on an in-
dividual basis, Harralson didn’t
hesitate to cite as his most
memorable basketball experience
a team accomplishment.

“My junior year in the ODAC
tourney quarterfinals, we were
behind 13 points at halftime. Then
they scored four straight points to
take a 17-point lead, two of them
coming on a slam dunk. But we
ended up beating them by eight
points.

“That comeback was the finest
team effort I ever saw. It was
definitely the game I will
remember the most.”’

Coach Norris Aldridge, whose
track teams won two conference
titles and went undefeated in 1987,
is The Phi’s Coach-of-the-Year.

Aldridge came to Washington
and Lee in 1969 as an assistant in
football and track and field. He
took over the leadership of the
track program in 1971. Since then,
W&L track teams have compiled
a record of 94-42. And, since 1976,
his squads have never suffered
more than three losses in a single
season, compiling a record of
63-15, or an 80.8 winning percen-
tage. W&L is riding a streak of
four consecutive Old Dominion
Athletic Conference titles in in-
door track, and an Aldridge-
coached team has not lost a track
meet since 1983.

A native of Natural Bridge,
Aldridge was a standout quarter-
back at Natural Bridge High

School for three seasons. He went
on to earn three varsity football
letters and a degree in business
administration from the Universi-
ty of Richmond.

The year 1987 saw W&L track
teams blow away the ODAC, tak-
ing the indoor championship by 48
points and the outdoor title by 55
points. But, typically, Aldridge

 

gives all the credit to his athletes.

‘“‘We really had some outstan-
ding performances,” he said.
W&L “‘lost a lot of good people
from last year,’’ and two con-
ference championships really
were not expected, but this team
“twas able to come together’’ ex-
ceptionally well.

The indoor season began with
a record-setting performance by
freshman Phil Sampson in the
VMI Relays. In his first meet as a
collegian, the rookie pole vaulter
cleared 14’6’’, a full six inches bet-
ter than the school record.

In the ODAC Indoor Champion-
ship meet, held at VMI, W&L
crushed the conference, taking
first place in five events and
finishing in at least one of the top
four places in every event but one.
Junior Andrew White won the 55-
meter hurdles, ran on two relay
teams, and took second place in
the 400-meter run. He was named
ODAC Runner-of-the-Year, and
Aldridge was named conference
Coach-of-the-Year in indoor track.
Murray set new school and con-
ference records in winning the
shot put, and senior John Burl-
ingame took first place in the long
jump. Junior John White scored in
four individual events and ran on
two winning relay teams.

The outdoor season began with

a trouncing of Roanoke College in
which W&L won 11 of 17 events
and swept four of them. Junior
John White and Andrew White
won two events, and freshman
Wes Boyd won the 100-meter dash
in his first college track meet.

The Generals prepared for the
ODAC Outdoor Championships by
participating in the Catholic In-
vitational.

The outdoor conference meet
once again demonstrated W&L’s
affinity for large margins of vic-
tory. The Generals embarrassed
the ODAC, taking one of the top
four places in every event but one

and winning nine of the day’s 17 . [

events. Once again, Andrew White
led the Generals, winning the 110
and 400-meter hurdles and runn-
ing on the victorious 1600-meter
relay team. Boyd won the 100 and
200-meter runs and placed third in
the long jump. Murray set a new
outdoor conference record and
again won the shot put, and Moore
took the conference title in the
1500-meter run. Carder won the
pole vault, and McCormick again
won the high jump.

Not surprisingly, Aldridge was
again named ODAC Coach-of-the-
Year. His 6-0 dual-meet record
and two conference titles in 1987
demonstrate outstanding ability
and talent on his part.

 

 

 

 

 

Norris Aldridge

 

 

Here’s to a job
well done

This is going to be hokey, but what the hell.

The Ring-tum Phi has honored two people this week — Jefferson
Harralson and Norris Aldridge — for their outstanding contribution to
Washington and Lee athletics over the past academic year. In singling
out these two individuals, however, we run into a problem. Every
athlete who participated in intercollegiate athletics for W&L is just as
deserving of receiving such praise.

But what exactly am I trying to get at here? Well, I guess I am say-
ing that, whether or not your picture made it in the Phi as Athlete-of-
the-Week, you all have earned some recognition for the time, effort
and dedication you have given to your respective sports teams.

As the lacrosse amd men’s tennis teams play in the limelight, we
sometimes forget about the people who play the so-called ‘‘minor
sports.’’ Cross country, track, wrestling, golf, women’s tennis and
swimming almost inevitably take a back seat to football, lacrosse,
men’s tennis, basketball and water polo.

I remember David Emrich wrote a column earlier in the year in
which he too expressed his feelings about the dilemma of the unequal
amounts of coverage given one sport over the others. “Second to no
one”’ was the headline and nothing could be closer to the truth.

Why should an athlete who sacrifices just as much time for one sport
not receive his or her due while someone else is grabbing the
spotlight? It sometimes just doesn’t seem fair.

I was talking with a basketball player the other day and this person
(who didn’t even play a whole lot of minutes) was estimating that dur-
ing the season he spent an average of five hours a day (including
weekends) practicing and sitting in meetings.

Five hours a day? Add five more hours and you are holding down a
steady job. And basketball players are not the only ones. I think it’s
safe to say every sport here requires at least three hours a day,
without even considering the amount of time taken up for traveling to
away games.

When you consider these time demands, it becomes even more
amazing to see the list of those athletes who have obtained a 3.5 or
higher GPA for one of the two semesters. I’m positive the number is
just as high for those who make the Dean’s List.

In order to rectify the problem, throughout the fall, winter and spr-
ing sports seasons, David Emrich and I have tried extremely hard to
make sure each team was awarded equal coverage in The Phi. This
task was very difficult, considering the fact that certain sports are
more popular than other ones. Is your lead story the football team’s
great comeback or cross country winning yet another dual meet? I
hope the job we did was good enough and my apologies to those people
who feel their teams were slighted.

I guess the purpose of this final column is to say ‘“‘great job’ to all
the hundreds of athletes who have worn a Generals’ jersey on the play-
ing field or courts. In terms of winners, we had four Old Dominion
Athletic Conference team champions, three Coaches-of-the-Year, two
Players-of-the-Year, six all-Americans and two teams come oh-so-
close to capturing W&L’s first national championship. The athletes
have represented this University well with exemplary sportsmanship
and hard work. To all those who were involved, you have every right to
be proud of yourselves.

(I said it was going to be hokey)

Notes... Turning our attention to the world of the professionals, the
New York Mets are beginning to realize that it ain’t so easy when you
are the defending champions (I think I predicted this somewhere but I
can’t recall exactly where). Dwight Gooden is back, but the loss of
Bobby Ojeda and the inconsistency of Sid Fernandez and Ron Darling
have made the most feared starting rotation seem very tame... Final-
ly, I think a special thanks is in order for Skip Bertram, Perry Hayes
and Mathew Horridge for their efforts in taking sports pictures for The
Phi. Their work was top notch and added a positive dimension for our
sports pages this year
