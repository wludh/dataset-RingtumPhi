Dicheie Meeting
Attended by 85

A record total of 85 students met
last night to learn about W&L’s de-
bate team and the new topic for
debate this year—Resolved: that the
federal government should guaran-
tee to all qualified high school grad-
uates the opportunity for a higher
education.

The high number of students who
attended last night’s meeting was en-
couraging to Mr. William Chaffin,
director of the Debate Team. At the
same meeting last year there were
67 students, and the year before
45 attended it. Chaffin estimated that
25 to 30 of the students last night
were upperclassmen.

The first varsity debate at David-
<on on October 11 and 12 will be the
earliest start the Debate Team has
had sinee Chaffin came to W&L
five vears ago. An all-freshman
icam will be sent to Wake Forest on
the last weekend in October.

Members of the Debate Team
have been studying the issue before
them since August. Jack Eure and

Slanted Seats, Air Conditioning

By CHARLES NEWMAN
Ass’t News Editor

Robert E. Lee Chapel, hidden for
the past year behind a construction
fence, was formally opened to the
publie in the first week of August.
Although the outward appearance
of the chapel is the same, there has
been extensive renovation on its in-
terior.

Great attention was paid to keep-
ing the Chapel as original as pos-
sible, while modernizing it, strength-
cning its baleonies, and in general
fire-proofing the interior.

The new electrical fixtures were
specially designed from the origin-
al fixtures. The pipe organ, which
has been silent since 1938, has been
restored to use.

men who chose deferred rush to two
things: the extra day in rush week,
which he said hurt the houses and

| added to the freshmen’s problems

of choosing between them, and what
he called the “changing outlook”
among freshmen.

With the relatively small pledge
class that many houses have, de-
ferred rush will take on added im-
portance. Because of the number of
freshmen going deferred even
though they hold fraternity bids,
Broaddus hopes to begin deferred
rush in two weeks rather than four.

IFC officers felt that rush week in
general went well and that it was
“cleaner” than last year. There were
only four reported cases in which
rush regulations were violated,
three of the cases involved ques-
tionable rushing tactics and the
fourth a violation on the part of a
freshman.

At present, 240 out of the class’s
338 freshmen have pledged a fratern-
ity. They are as follows:

A Keynote

The circumstances of the world are so variable, that
an irrevocable purpose or opinion is almost synony-

mous with a foolish one.
W. H. Seward

Today is not yesterday.—We ourselves change.—
How then, can our works and thoughts, if they are al-
ways to be the fittest, continue always the same.—
Change, indeed, is painful, yet ever needful.

—Thomas Carlyle

For the past ten years and more, Ring-tum Phi editors
and their associates have written editorials about the same,
basic problems. Most of these students have been careful to
avoid mere complaining; they have made some excellent pro-
posals, they have rendered some compelling arguments, and
they have offered some concrete evidence in support of their
ideas.

To our dismay, we have found that we shall be writing
editorials this year about these same problems. The thorny
issues of the past remain as the critical dilemmas of today.
Despite scores of student polls and hundreds of editorials, a
seemingly deaf ear has been leaned our way by those in a po-
sition to take action.

We say “seemingly deaf” because Washington and Lee’s
administrative officials and most of its faculty are very willing,
even anxious, to know of student opinion in all phases of
campus life. But it does not take many reactionary faculty
members to vote down a carefully studied and progressive
program.

The student body does not expect the faculty to cater to
its every whim, but problems such as those involving absence
regulations or those involved with our present grading system
cannot be called whims. These are two of the four or five
major issues which have concerned students at W&L for years.
We hope the faculty committee which has been studying a
more liberal cut proposal will indicate a decision which shows
that some consideration has been given to student desires.

But if tradition wins out again, those few professors who
have bogged down Washington and Lee in the past will do it
again. These men have heard our arguments before—many
times—so why should they listen to them again’ The first
week of each month will come, the faculty meetings will be
held, and they will cast their votes for the sacred status quo,
as they always have. And the thousands of words written and
spoken for progress will seem wasted once again.

But who knows. Perhaps if the arguments are spoken
again, perhaps if the hope of progress is instilled in our hearts
again, then perhaps the words of Seward and Carlyle will find
their way into some musty minds and the everlasting no will be
altered. In the hope that this might happen, we shall continue
to have an editorial column in 1963-64.

Why Not Summer School?

Why go to college for four years? Why not three, and then
on to graduate school? The pace of world events almost de-
mands that today’s students get their degrees without any delay.
Some students do want to finish their undergraduate work in
three years; others want to get in some additional courses which
they could not take during the regular term. And other stu-
dents just flunk required courses.

The answer for all these situations is summer school. Over
sixty students from the School of Arts and Sciences alone went
to school last summer; it might have been more if it weren’t
so difficult to find a school with suitable academic standards
for summer work.

There has been talk in the past few years among the faculty
and the students about the chance for a summer session at
Washington and Lee. The law school does it, so why not have
the undergraduate school follow suit. A summer in Lexington
need not be as dull as it sounds at first: women could be ad-
mitted for the summer session only, and they could be housed
in the dorms adjacent to the Commons.

We realize that a suggestion such as this rocks W&L’s tra-
ditionalists completely out of their chairs. But is it such a bad
idea? The opportunity for a top-notch education, unlimited
social opportunities, and the scenic merits of the Shenandoah
Valley all lumped into one package is rather inviting. W&L
would have no trouble getting the necessary applicants with
those features highlighting the menu.

At the same time, W&L would have to accept the fact that
those students who attended summer school here but were not
regular term students could not be assimilated into the W&L
way of life. In order to offer a good summer session here, we
would have to waive some of our time-honored traditions in
favor of just plain education, no trimmings. But every school
which has a summer session must make that same sacrifice; why
can’t we?

Our honor system could be maintained to some degree in
the summer by the simple threat that any student found cheat-
ing would be dropped from the role. Coats and ties would be
too warm in July and August anyway, so that tradition could
be relaxed during the summer session.

In short, W&L would be itself in name only during a
summer session, but at least it would be that. None of the pro-

‘A Remarkahle Film’

 

 

Pace Showers Praises

By TOM PACE

The major difficulty in translat-
ing the novel “Lolita” to the screen
lay in the latter medium’s inherent
inability to take full advantage of
the brilliantly comic passages in the
book. The film’s director, Stanley
Kubrick, has done the next best
thing. He hired Vladmir Nabokov to
write the screenplay. Nabokov, rec-
ognizing his problem, solved it by
writing a somewhat different story
for the movie. His primary change
is adding three years to Lolita’s age,
and thus enhancing the comic possi-
bilities of the plot.

Humbert Humbert comes to
America from Europe. He decides
to take residence at the home of
Charlotte Hayes and her daughter,
Delores, because of Mrs. Hayes’
delicious cherry pies. He quickly
becomes fascinated with Delores,
called Lolita by her more inti-
mate friends. Quilty enters, exits,
Mrs. Hayes sends Lolita to camp
and becomes Mrs. Humbert. Mrs.
Humbert dies and Mr. Humbert
goes to camp. Humbert protects
Lolita. Lolita protects Humbert.
They are happy. Quilty enters,
exits. Lolita and her step-father
go to the mid-west where Quilty
enters, exits again and where
Humbert becomes less happy.
They go further west and Quilty
enters and exits once more, this
time taking Lolita. Quilty dies
violently, Sad ending.

Some of you may mistakenly
think that “Lolita” is meant to be
a serious drama. If so, you will be
mistaken. It is serious comedy, or
that which treats a serious subject
comically. Kubrick and Nabokov
have done remarkably well. “Lolita”
is treated with an aura of sophisti-
cation that even French directions
would be proud of. Kubrick care-
fully avoids any display of sex. For
example, when Humbert has picked
up Lolita from camp and they are
driving back, she says, “I didn’t
miss you; but it deesn’t matter. You
don’t care.” Humbert is surprised,
“What do you mean? Of course
I care. I eare very much.” Lolita
replies, “No you don’t.” And Hum-
bert, “What makes you say that?”
And Lolita, “Well, you haven’t even
kissed me yet.” No matter what
Humbert’s reaction is, it will appear
awkward. So Kubrick brilliantly
cuts to a shot of the car roaring
excitedly down a hill. The next
morning at the hotel Lolita gets out
of bed and walks over to Humbert’s
cot. They talk a little and then she
says, “What time is it?”

“It's time for breakfast.”

“No, I don’t want to eat break-
fast.”

“Oh. Well, What do you want?”

No audible answer as she bends
down and whispers in his ear.
Then a repeat of the shot of the
car. But this time the car is go-
ing slower; not excitedly, but con-
tentedly. Kubrick cautiously avoids
what might be labeled smutty
lines and lurid scenes by simply
making the mood one of comedy,
He keeps this up throughout. His
tempo is amazing. He rarely al-
lows a scene to rest on the screen.
He lets each scene build to the
height of hilarity, and then cuts
quickly to another which often
proves to be equally as funny.

I am able to find nothing but
praise for this film. Peter Sellers as
Quilty, and Shelly Winters as Char-
lotte Hayes are as good as you

could hope. And James Mason as
Humbert and Sue Lyon as Lolita
are both excellent. Mason is a stud-
ied actor whose use of hands, facial
expressions, and voice inflections al-
ways command attention and always
seem right. Lyon appears to be a
natural actress, if such a_ thing
exists. Even the musical score is|
superb. Nelson Riddle seems almost |
as clever as Nabokov.
Still, most of the accolades must!
belong to Kubrick and Nabokov. !

Coun Syuire

ADDISON L. BROCKENBROUGH

Sept. 12, 1963
Thursday

The freshmen got back from
Natural Bridge today, and I got
the chance to meet a young mem-
ber of the Class of ’67 named Mike
Newman. He was from the West—
East Orange, Idaho—and he real-
ly didn’t know too much about
what was going on. He was a
sharp-looking guy, and I could
tell he would get into a good fra-
ternity if he wanted to join one.
He said he felt comfortable go-
ing into Rush Week because it
seemed that he must already have
friends at W&IL. from all the mail
he got during the summer.

I asked Mike if he was confused
about which houses to see, and he
said a little bit, but he thought
everything would come out well
enough. The fraternity men would
be in the dorms to make dates
that night. I figured he wasn’t as
sure of himself as he let on.

Sept. 14, 1963
Saturday

While walking through the
freshman guad this morning I
saw my new-found friend Mike
Newman standing near the end
of a line of about 30 other fresh-
men. I asked what the attraction
was, and he told me it was the
IFC phone. Why did he need to
use the IFC phone? To call up the
house he had doubled up on
Thursday night. Mike’s date card
attested to his inability to tell
any fraternity “no” on Thursday
night. It’s especially hard, he said,
when there are eight men from
some house standing around your
room waiting for you to sign up.

Sept. 15, 1963
Sunday

Mike was a couple of pews up
from me in church this morning,
but when I saw him after the ser-
vice, I could tell he hadn’t got-
ten much out of it. He popped an-
other couple of aspirins into his
mouth as we walked down the
steps, shook hands with the min-
ister, and headed up toward the
freshman dorm. He was sluggish,
but willing to talk about the first
two days of rush. He had seen
four houses Saturday, but the
only one he had really impressed
with was Tappa Tag. He had seen
that on the last date. Who did he
remember from that date? Well—
he had had a few beers earlier in
the day, and he didn’t remember
too many of the guys, but that
Gail Stevens and the Brenda Bry-
ant were two of the sharpest
chicks he had ever seen. He had
talked with them for a long time.
What about the guys in the house?
Well—the Furshlugginger fellow

 

‘Another Country’ Views

Racial Issue

ANOTHER COUNTRY
By James Baldwin

By JAMES F. LEDBETTER

At a literal level, it would seem
that James Baldwin, the young Ne-
gro essayist and novelist who has
received a kind of national notorie-
ty of late, is trying to answer the
perennial question that pops up in
any bull-session about integration
in his latest best-seller: “Yea, but
what if your sister went out with
one?” And on a more serious level,
this is exactly what Baldwin is con-
cerned with; love—and sex—be-
tween the darks and whites.

Baldwin has shown us in his es-
says that he understands, and lives,
the complexities of the racial issue.
He is suspicious of the white lib-
eral, mainly because he has seen
him prowl the streets of Harlem
looking for Negro women; and ulti-|
mately, this is the way Baldwin sees
the whole problem—through — the
looking glass of sex. For it is here
that people are really themselves
and all the pretentions are stripped

 

On ‘Lolita’
They are looking at America with |
European eyes and have satirized|
brilliantly many of our failings. I
am not alone in my praise. Esquire,
Saturday Review, Sight and Sound,
and Newsweek all named it as one
of the two finest American produc-
tions of last year. To know you
have laughed more at a movie than
ever before, and yet to be moved by
its near-tragic element is a remark-
able thing. Accordingly, “Lolita” is
a remarkable film.

anything, but what difference did

ternoon. Apparently he’s already
made up his mind which house
he’s going to join. He’s had a lot
of fun both times he has been up
to the Tappa Keg house, and he’s
gotten to know those two girls he
mentioned real well. Even had a
chance to dance with them last
night, he said—some of the boys
in the house just happened to be
able to play some instruments,
and they had a regular party. He
brushed me off after a couple of
minutes, though, because he had
a list in his hand of freshmen he
was to see who were still on the

Sept. 21, 1963
Saturday

All the fraternities pledged to-
day, so I guess Mike Newman has
that pin in his lapel by now. I’m
quite sure that he doesn’t know
more than four or five members of
the house he has pledged, but I
suppose he’ll turn out well eneugh.
The only thing that really disap-
pointed me about him, or maybe
about the rushing system, was his
mention yesterday about dirty
rushing. It seems the house he de-
cided to join asked him to dirty
rush certain other houses that
were the same boys Tappa Keg
wanted. It wouldn’t look so bad,
you see, if freshmen were dirty
rushing their classmates.

Through Sex

away; where people
they hurt each other.

wonder why

In order to explore the issue ful-
ly, Baldwin devises almost every
posible form of inter-racial, and
inter-sexual, sex contact. If the
eight main characters are arranged
diagrammatically as to who slept
with whom, an unbroken cross is
formed. Married love and its pitfalls,
love between mixed couples both
ways, homosexual love, and extra-

marital love are all encountered.
Baldwin must be congratulated on
accomplishing all this with such

astonishing economy of characters.
He is obviously experienced in these
matters; but the descriptions of
homosexual encounters are a little
sickening despite their accuracy.

What is the meaning of this? Does
a large perspective result from all
this bedroom English to teach us
something about love or about sex
or about race problems? It must be
admitted that this reviewer was a
little bewildered by the panoply of
events. The title seems to come
from what is perhaps the most-
quoted sentence of this century,
taken from Marlowe’s The Jew of
Malta: “Thou hast committed forni-
cation; but that was in another
country, and besides, the wench is
dead.”

But where the other country stood
for the relativity of modern morals
in Hemingway and Eliot, it seems
to have a different meaning for
Baldwin; the other country of love,
where people can go to hide their
troubles until they are summoned
back to—Greenwich village.

Frankly, Baldwin writes much
better when he stays in the village.
His description of a typical men’s
room is so evocative that the read-
er will have to take a walk in the
fresh air before continuing.

The main criticism this reviewer
has of Baldwin’s style is that despite
his knowledge of how people think,
make love, and relieve themselves,
he has no idea of how they talk. The
dialogue is atrocious, and what is
worse, people grin while they say
things, something which seems
physically impossible. “‘Let’s go to
bed,’ grinned Vivaldo,’ sounds like
a swiffie joke.

Despite this, Another Country is
recommended to the liberal of
mind—and the strong of stomach.

News From
Other Campuses
Ann Arbor, Mich,—(I.P.)—The

small college should resist the pres-
sures of trying to be everything to
everybody, says Alan O. Pfnister,
University of Michigan associate
professor of higher education.

“It can resist these pressures by
seeking to b edistinctive, offering
a limited number of majors, and
working at some depth in these,”
he says. “Making use of the other
simplified channels of communi-
cation possible, it can keep the
entire faculty and student body
informed and stimulated. It does
not face some of the problems that
a larger institution faces because
of the sheer magnitude and com-
plexity of its operation.”
Professor Pfnister points out, “The
small college can also exploit the
sense of community. It can work
closely with the students if it wants
to do so. However, it cannot assume
that because it is smail the proper
relation between faculty and stu-
dents will obtain.”

The small college can dare to be
different, he emphasizes. “With the

Coach Lee McLaughlin says his 1963 Washington and
Lee football squad could have the best overall depth of any
team he has coached in his seven years with the Generals.

That may sound like so much tall talk to McLaughlin’s op-
posing coaches, most of whom can count three and four con-

secutive losses to W&L because of the Generals’ long suit—

“We've got 50 boys on our varsity

McLaughlin's rosy comments came

Soccer’s Returnees; Injuries Key

By TOM CARPENTER

Injuries appear to be the key to
a successful soccer season for Coach
Joe Lyles’ men this year. One or
two injured starters could cause
disaster for the club as reserves are
at a premium.

Coach Lyles is very satisfied with
his front line players and has praise
for the reserves that he has, but he

i} has a valid complaint that he has a

shortage of manpower. As of now
Lyles is counting on only 15 players

sophomore Dave Kirkpatrick are
having a spirited battle for an op-

Two All-Staters will be on the
forward wall in Tim Henry, the
talented sophomore from Bermuda,
and Jim Mell, one of the co-captains.
The third man will be underrated
Steve Hibbard.

The other inside position goes to
Chris Clarke, who is back after a
three-year layoff.

The halfbacks will be Bruce Jack-
son, another All-Stater, and another
sophomore, Wes Horner.

Why Not Summer School?

(Continued from page 2)

posals would change W&L as we know it now during the regu-
lar school year. A University such as ours is more than a set

of classrooms—it is a way of |

ife; but as it is now, W&L is

even less than a set of classrooms during the summer.

Education is sorely needed t

hese days, and facilities such as

those at W&L are invaluable—so much so that we should not

allow them to lie fallow for a

fourth of every year. We are

aware of the fact that administration officials do not favor
this idea; we would like to know how the student body feels.

 

Soccer Team In Opener Thursday

(Continued from page 3)

At fullback will be Pete Preston,
Dave Redmond, and Claiburne
Darden. All-State goalie Tom Green
returns to protect the nets.

The reserves are Howard Busse,
Preben Berthesolen, and Ed Warn-
er. Berthesolen, a foreign exchange
student from Denmark, showed well
in Sunday’s 6-1 triumph over the
freshmen with two goals. Warner
played fullback last year, but has
been moved to halfback to make
full use of his speed.

Last year the Generals finished
third in the state with a 9-3-2 record.
The University of Virginia took top
honors with Lynchburg College fin-
ishing second. Lyles is hopeful that
his club can replace Virginia in the
top spot this season. He commented
that to succeed Virginia the team
will need sharper passing than has

He also emphasized a need for more

with the hustle and spirit displayed

The freshman team, coached by
Bob Lathrop, impressed Lyles in the
three varsity-freshman scrimmages.
Three of the moys may be promoted
to the varsity to boost the bench
strength. Fullbacks Bill Skinner and
Bill Fisher along with wing Brad
Shankle have caught the attention
of the varsity coach. Lyles is hope-
ful that he does not have to add

candidates in mathematics or the

sidered.

A Fellow receives $1,800 for the
year’s study, plus dependency al-
lowances; the Foundation also pays
tuition and fees.

All seniors who are interested
inconsidering a career in college
teaching are urged to discuss the
fellowships at their earliest con-
venience with their major profes-
sors and with Dean Pusey, who is
Campus Representative for the
Woodrow Wilson Fellowships. The
deadline for nominations is Octob-
er 31, 1963.

Dr. Pusey stated that 21 Wash-
ington and Lee men have received
Wilson Fellowships in past years. He
stressed both the generous finan-
cial support which the fellowships
afford and their great prestige val-
ue. In addition to the recipients of
the awards, he added, many candi-
dates receive honorable mention,
which frequently leads to financial
assistance from other sources.

Qualities of face and figure which
last year’s members lacked will be
present when the W&L glee club
opens its season with the Parents

October 26.

Dorcas Campbell, Miss Virginia of
1963, will join glee club soloist John
Baker in several numbers from the
popular Broadway hit, West
Story. In addition, Miss Campbell
will several selections of her
own.

Miss Campbell, a native of Rock-

State Chairmen
Are Announced

The selection of state ch

airmen for Mock Convention

that five state chairmanships were now open because of per-

sonal conflicts among students

Eighty-six
Go Deferred

Wednesday night, all the members
of the freshman class who were in-
terested in pledging a fraternity,
but had not yet done so for one
reason or another, met with I. F. C.
President Art Broadus in the Stu-
dent Union for the purpose of disc-
cussing the procedure of Deferred
Rush.

Deferred Rush Early

President Broadus announced
that the I. F. C. had voted at its
meeting Monday night to have De-
ferred Rush begin two weeks after
the end of formal rushing instead of
the last year’s three weeks. He also
reminded the Freshmen that the
No-Contact Rule will be strictly en-
forced until Deferred Rush begins
at 1 p.m. on Saturday, October 5.

Informal Poll

At this meeting the Ring-tum Phi
conducted an informal poll of eigh-
teen freshmen, and asked them their
reasons for going deferred. Three
replied that they had not gotten a
bid, and four others said that they
had not gotten the bid they wanted.

Four freshmen said that they
thought that the rush system was in-
effective in that it did not give
people a real chance to see more
than six houses.

Other Reasons Given

Two freshmen said they did not
accept a bid they got because they

did not like the other prospective |

pledges that they saw at the second
Wednesday evening date, and one
other said that he did not like the
conduct of some of the brothers at
that time.
Crowd System

One freshman said that he thought
that the system was a “crowd sys-
tem,” that it tried to work too fast,
and that it did not give a freshman
much of a free choice. He said that

expected to nominate candidates in
the convention: Arizona, senior Bill
Burke; and Michigan, which is one
of the states in which the chairman-
ship is now vacant. New York and
Pennsylvania, which also have nom-
inees, are doubly important states.

The other state delegations and
their chairmen are: Alabama, Blaine

These Four Years

During the past two weeks, the Class of 1967 has been
formally introduced to Washington and Lee.

In a chain of assemblies, the freshmen have been told that
their university has a great deal to offer. They have been hear-
ing about certain ideals and traditions that make W&L unique;
they have been introduced to the men and facilities that will be
at their disposal for the next four years.

While all this is sinking in, we would like to volunteer
to you, the Class of 1967, a few words of wisdom.

If you are the average college freshman you will soon re-
gard as simple idealism most of the remarks you are now hear-
ing. Before too long, you will be encountering disappointment
after disappointment with what you are being told W&L can

ive.

: If you are the average freshman you will begin to reflect
satirically upon the ideals this University professes to stand
for: the speaking tradition, the “W&L gentleman,” conven-
tional dress, even the honor system.

You will also come to other disappointing conclusions:
there is no school spirit, the faculty is uninspiring, intellectual
curiosity is nil.

In short, you will discover that W&L will not give you the
fulfillment you look for, and you will be able to think up plen-
ty of reasons why.

However, there will be some of you who, for reasons in-
comprehensible to the average student, will discover at Wash-
ington and Lee the opportunities and inspiration you need for
complete fulfillment. You will find that our traditions and ideals
still exist, but they demand a great deal of effort to stay nour-
ished. For some few of you in the Class of 1967, then, the next
four years will be the most challenging and maturing experience
of your lives.

How do we explain this?

There was once the story of two boys—one an extreme
pessimist and one an extreme optimist. Psychologists decided
to experiment to see if they would ever change. The pessimist
was locked for twelve hours in a room furnished with every
source of entertainment immaginable—games, books, toys,
food, etc. At the end of the day, the boy was found sitting
idle in the middle of the room. Needless to say, he had not
budged an inch.

The optimist was locked for the same numer of hours in
a room completely barren except for a large pile of manure.
At the end of the day, the guilt-stricken doctors opened the
door to find the boy energetically digging into the mound.

When asked what he was doing, the optimist simply re-
plied that with all that manure there was bound to be a pony!

Fortunately, you are not faced with the same situation as
this optimist: the resources at hand are practically unlimited.
But few of you will ever think positively enough to recognize
this wealth. One of our saddest tragedies is that the majority
of students entering W&L will never experience what this uni-
versity can offer. If you are the “average” freshman, you will
share this tragedy.

 

Freshmen Are Human Beans, Too

At the outset of every school year there appears at Wash-
ington and Lee a last vestige of the days when freshman hazing
was sanctioned by the university and by the student body. This
last evidence that freshmen are not really full human beings,
this holdout of the collegiate dark ages, is, of course, the ludi-
crous “beanie.” It is truly farcical that the W&L student gov-
ernment expends effort to enforce conformity to the wearing
of this asinine skullcap. From the first the beanie contradicts
the idea that W&L men are gentlemen; for what gentlemen
would willingly be seen in such headgear? Beanies are prepos-
terously incongruous with conventional dress. Far from being
appropriate to a gentleman’s apparel, the beanie is actually
suitable to High School Harry in his natural habitat. If the
reader doubts the absurdity of the beanie, let him dare to wear
one to classes himself.

The beanie, though, is a difficult thing to attack, not be-
cause it is a revered tradition, but because it is so foolish that it
merits little consideration as a subject of reform. Beanies are
so silly that they can scarcely be called degrading. Washington
and Lee teems with willing crusaders of all sorts, but none of
them openly opposes the beanie. Yet if it is hard to arouse
serious opposition to the beanie, it is even harder to think up
some excuse for retaining the tradition. The freshman are told
each year that they must wear beanies in order that the upper-
classmen may recognize them as newcomers. It is highly un-
likely, however, that the freshman receives any special con-
sideration for wearing a beanie; more probably the beanie
tends to set him off as a person not worth paying any atten-
tion to. The freshmen are also told that they must wear beanies
in order that Lexington townspeople may recognize them as
new students. This is an “advantage” which would be auto-
matically declined by any student who has ever had to face a
group of the local gallants staring at his beanie. In the end the
beanies’ only real support might come from those students who
favor them as creating another possible offense for which a
freshman may be turned in to, and fined by, the Assimilation
Committee.

W and L’s Values Survive Only As Result
Of Sharing In A ‘Give And Take’ Process

The following is a reprint from
last year’s Ring-tum Phi written
when Noell was Assimilation Com-
mittee chairman.—Ed.

By BILL NOELL
Student Body President

Washington and Lee is not unique
among American universities solely
because of its rich
past and _ conse-
quent legacy of
tradition; other
schools are end-
dowed eaqually
generously with
notable founders,
successful alumni
and campuses
“unrivalled in
beauty.”
Nor do we stand
alone in our con-
tributions to this state or to the
nation, though we do take justifiable
pride in them. We certainly are not
the only institution to stress full
development of the individual, so-
cially or scholastically. Rather, it
is in terms of the image which
Washington and Lee connotes, that

 

Noell

 

our measure of distinction has be-
come significant and unparalleled.

That image is not the result of
our unthinking and unwilled devo-
tion to traditions; it is not because
Robert E. Lee spoke to other people
whom he encountered that we ob-
serve the speaking tradition; it is
not because Robert E. Lee dressed
meticulously that we are committed
to conventional dress; it is most em-
phatically not because Robert E. Lee
endorsed the freshman beanie with
his dying breath that men in their
first year at this university are re-
quired to mark themselves tempor-
arily with that conspicuous piece
of blue cloth.

The traditions to which the stu-
dent body subscribes are constant
values in an age in which the very
weak, the very meaningless and the
very sorry relative value too often
is the standard against which we
judge our actions. The four year
educational process at Washington
and Lee is something for in excess
of the mastery of one’s academics:
it is a give and take process, dur-
ing which the university receives

chants to new students on the cam-
pus, the beanie is indicative of the
man, with whom the student body
and alumni are sharing the most
valuable conventions imaginable—
those which instill a sense of pride
in the individual—pride in him-
self as a man, and pride in this uni-
versity, which it is his calling to

standards.

Delicate Balance In Teaching
Stressed by Pres. Fred C. Cole

By FRED C, COLE
From the Journal of
Medical Education

There is always the argument that
the prestigious scholar or scientist
can lift the academic or intellectual
level of a university merely by his
presence there. Maybe so, but I
doubt that it has the effect some
say it does. The undergraduate, who
is just starting on an academic ca-
reer and is perhaps never more
susceptible to enlighten influence,
derives little benefit from infrequent
glimpses of a research scholar who
devotes virtually all his energy and
time exclusively to research and
study—rarely, if ever, finding occa-
sion to talk with young people and
answer their questions.

When such men are a part of a
university community, they can ex-
ert tremendous influences for good

 

among students and faculty alike;
but the influence can usually be im-
portant only if their research activ-
ities can be made meaningful to these
others.

The nuclear physicist of interna-
tional fame, engaged in research
which employs the latest high-pow-
ered accelerator, certainly is apply-
ing principles that the student should
know and understand; but the
chances are that his greatest efforts
are far above the student’s ability
to comprehend and appreciate. Stu-
dents who hold graduate fellow-
ships and research assistantships
often become little more than clerks
or errand boys in these exciting
projects, and they learn little in
relation to the time spent. In the
case of those faculty members who
are supposed to pursue research and
teach, I have observed a tendency
in many to devote more time and

 

DeJarnette Unchained

Here Come

By JACK DeJARNETTE

Once upon a time not so very
long ago there was a little boy who
wanted a popsickle. Since this little
boy did not have the money with
which to buy this
popsickle, he was
not quite sure
what he should
do. He thought it
would help him
to walk down to
his house and get
- the money from
his mother.

So he went
down to his house
and said to his
mother, “I want a
popsickle so give me the money
for it.” His mother said, “No, not
unless you ask for it politely.”

Instead of doing so he began to
call her names, and so she sent him
to bed without any supper, and it
was days before she would buy him
a treat.

Moral: Insult gathers just about as
many flies as vinegar.

Hotel Fire

If Wednesday’s “fire” is any in-
dication of the spirit of the school
this year, then the cheerleaders are
going to have a particularly rough
job on their hands at football games.
Not only was the attendance poor,
but what little yelling there was, was
immediately squelched by a brick-
throwing member of the fire depart-
ment .

Hollins and Baldwin Mixers

Well, Hollins and Mary Baldwin
both had their mixers this past
weekend. The only difference was

 

DeJarnette

 

That Aesop

that you could breathe at the Hol-
lins mixer, whereas at Baldwin you
had to wear tennis shoes so you
could sprint outside for a cigarette
and a breath of air. At least I can’t
think of any other logical reason
why the girls wore tennis shoes to
a dance, but maybe you can. (Ac-
tually the girls wore them so they
could outrun the “wolfish upper-
classmen” from W&L and catch the
innocent freshmen from “THE” Uni-
versity). There were twelve W&L
freshmen there and four busloads
of U. Va. freshmen. It was a good
thing that some of our sophomores,
juniors, and seniors so nicely de-
cided to go and fill up the room.

But don’t give up hope for lack
of social experiences. If the master
plan of the Tuesday edition goes
through, who knows what may
happen? Perhaps we could even
have a dance with the V. M. L
summer school boys (commonly
known as the football team).

Think of the headlines this would
make in the Alumni Magazine. Bet-
ter still, think of the headlines it
would make in the Southern Col-
legian.

More Joint Activities

This would only be the very be-
ginning of joint activities with our
nearest academic neighbor. We could
dance with them in summer, play
football with them in the fall, drink
with them at Christmas, and in the
spring we could combine their dress
parades with Corps Days. Then we
could take all the people who went
crazy and lock them up with our
locked reserved books, using a lock
borrowed from the P. E. department
since it would not ever be opened
again anyway.

 

 

   

wl lhld

The observant freshman knows
that Lexington boasts two theatres:
the State and the Lyric, the latter
known affectionately as the “arm-
pit.” The State shows the usual
tripe from Hollywood, the Lyric
generally features revivals from the
past and a generous selection of art-
films from both foreign and domes-
tic (non-Hollywood) sources. This
past weekend was a good example
of the fare available: Hootenanny
Hoot (the State) was delightful if
one didn’t look at the screen, while
the Lyric aired War and Peace, a
convincing if truncated adaptation
of the novel by Tolstoi. Audrey
Hepburn was not the Natasha Rostof
that Jean Simmons could have been,
but the cast and direction were gen-
erally superb. It was refreshing—
once—to see battle sequences that
were really effective, instead of the
usual tub-thumping. The State
promises to redeem itself by bring-
ing us The Great Escape and Irma
La Douce; the Lyric will offer soon
Advise and Consent and the finest
American art-film to date: David
and Lisa.

Lothesome Summer Schedule

Mention must be made of an
unusually vapid and _ loathsome
summer schedule of films here that
did nothing to entertain the few
students left in town. The Lyric,
under temporary domestic manage-
ment, perpetrated a ghastly parade
of John Wayne westerns, oriential
despots, and stereotyped ghouls. The
State managed a few weeks of sum-
mer Hollywood fare: The Brothers

attention to research and less to
teaching.

In most universities, rank and file
faculty members are expected to
engage in research activity. In some
instances, there are university funds
available for financing worthwhile
faculty research interests; in others,
faculty members are encouraged to
seek outside support for their work.
Where outside support is sought
a well planned, coordinated, proper-
ly administered university program,
good results are expected; but often
there is an absence of planning or
coordination or decision, and much
energy is wasted—or much effort
is duplicated—and projects are un-
dertaken that shift the emphasis of
a department or a school or perhaps
a whole institution.

A delicate balance between the
teaching and research responsibili-
ties of a professor and of a univer-
sity must be maintained, or there
will result, I fear, emphasis upon
research that lessens the effective-
ness of the teacher.

Is teaching less significant than
reasearch? I think not.

Is there no way in which the
two can be blended effectively so
that all concerned—the student, the
professor, the university, the out-
side sponsor—will benefit? I think

ot Magic (which wasn’t), and The
re ., | Longest Day (an admirable traves-
In the simplest way I can say it, ty)

universities perhaps will just have
to balk at taking on increasing re-
search loads for outside sponsors.
Many of the assignments accepted by
universities could be just as effec-
tively, perhaps more effectively,
carried on in nonacademic labora-
tories and testing facilities.

Some universities appear to be
eager to take on any and all re-
search assignments, whether they are
related to the primary objectives of
the institution or not. Some accept
grants that have such limitations at-
tached to them by the sponsor that
they are virtually valueless in serv-
ing any objective of the university
at all. Increasing numbers of spon-
sors contribute to colleges and uni-
versities without undue restrictions;
but there are enough who continue
to impose these burdens as to con-
stitute cause for concern.

New York Film Festival

In New York this past week, the
festival of art-films at Philharmonic
Hall continued to attract wide praise.
Three movies of special interest en-
joyed better-than-average recep-
tions on and off Broadway: The
Haunting, directed by Robert Wise,
Mondo Cane (“A World Gone To
The Dogs”), a documentary of hu-
man(?) behavior much deeper than
its contrived title suggests, and Vis-
conti’s The Leopard. Hopefully,
these will find their way to Lex-

Freshmen: Meet Your Coaches;

Lyles and Leslie In Spotlight

By SHAUN DONAHOE

With the fall athletic season in
full swing, the editors have decided
to interview the various coaches in
order that the student body might
get better acquainted with them.
This week, Coaches Joe Lyles and
Buck Leslie share the spotlight.

Coach Lyles, entering his fifth
season as soccer mentor, came to
W&L from Springfield College,
where he received his masters in
1959. Lyles, a native of St. Louis
played football, basketball, and base-
ball at St. Louis University for two
years before deciding to give pro
baseball a try in 1949. For three
years he roamed the St. Louis
Browns’ organization as a combina-
tion pitcher-outfielder. During these
years Lyles spent the winter months
playing pro basketball with now-
defunct NBA franchises in St. Louis,
Chicago, and Syracuse.

In 1952 Lyles spent ten months
touring 44 countries the world over
playing against the Harlem Globe-
trotters. Returning to the US., he
was greeted by the outstretched hand
of Uncle Sam and spent the next
two years as coach of the famed
Brooke Army Comets at Fort Sam
Houston in San Antonio. Under

 

Lyles’ tutelage, the Comets reached
the semi-finals of the service basket-
ball tournament there.

A back injury received in the
service having cut short his baseball
career, Lyles took the job of swim-
ming director at the Palm Beach
Cabana Club upon discharge. The
desire to finish his college educa-
tion was too strong, however, and,
at the age of 25, Lyles entered
Springfield. It was while at Spring-
field that he met his wife Pat, who
is a frequent spectator at the Gen-
erals’ soccer games.

Coach Buck Leslie enjoyed an
outstanding athletic career before
turning to coaching in 1950. A na-
tive of Rockbridge county, Leslie
captained his high school baseball
team and quarterbacked the football
team. After graduating from high
school, he served a three-year hitch
with the Navy in the Pacific during
World War II before coming to W&L
in the fall of 1945. With W&L a
member of the Southern Conference
at that time, Leslie lettered in base-
ball each of his four years here.
A strong-armed righthander, Leslie
passed up an offer from the Brook-
lyn Dodgers to devote more time

Soccer Team Travels To Pfeiffer

Hopes High For Undefeated Year

By TIM HENRY

On Friday the W&L booters meet
Pfieffer College in their season
opener at Pfeiffer. This small North
Carolina college has already played
one game, a 4-1 loss to North Caro-
lina State last Wednesday, while
W&L’s only test was a 6-1 win
over the freshman team earlier this
week.

Prospects for a win look favorable
for Coach Lyle’s soccermen who
boast a strong forward line and a
formidable defense. Only two mem-
bers of last year’s team which beat
Pfeiffer 2-1 will be missing.

All week the defense has been
adjusting to the “M” offense that

 

steady rain and three inches of mud.
This year, however, Coach Lyles
feels the team is much more profi-
cient in the fundamentals and should
take charge early in the game. Last
year, Pfeiffer scored first and W&L
had to fight back to score two goals
in the final quarter to win a game
they dominated three quarters of the
time. A more “opportunistic” for-
ward line should take advantage of
the breaks and go ahead early this
year.

Although he is taking one game
at a time, Coach Lyles is looking
forward to a fine season for his men.

Macon Seeking Second Win;
Generals Ready For Opener

It has been six long years since|
Randolph-Macon whipped Washing-
ton and Lee in football, but Satur-
day could be the Yellow Jackets’
day.

The Generals open their 1963 cam-
paign against what W&L head coach
Lee MeLaughlin terms “a consider-
ably stronger Randolph - Macon
club.” Game time is 2 p.m. on Wil-
son Field.

“Randolph-Macon gave us our
closest game last year,” McLaughlin
said, “and this year it has one of
its best teams in several seasons.”

The Jackets last defeated Wash-
ington and Lee in 1957, 33-6. The
clubs tied, 33-33, in 1959, and W&L
has won the last three games in the}
traditional state encounters.

In 1962, it took a combination of
some fancy running by halfback
Stuart Yoffe and a TD pass from
fullback Tommy Keesee to end
Buck Ogilvie to subdue a bunch of
stubborn Jackets, 19-13, at Ashland.

This year, however ,the Generals
may have to battle even harder to
pick up a win.

Randolph-Macon, coached by
W&L alumnus Joe McCutcheon, al-
ready has one win under its belt—
a 6-0 triumph over Millersville—
and game experience is mighty val- |
uable in early season play.

 

Moreover, the Jackets unveiled a!
new lonesome end offense, and a}
defense which held Millersville to!
two first downs and 177 yards total!
offense last Saturday in Pennsyl-
vania.

“T had to come away impressed!
with Randolph-Macon’s overall de-|
fensive ability,” said Wé&L chief |
scout Boyd Williams. “They tackled |
extremely well, rushed the passer |
all day and displayed a real tough |
pass defense by intercepting four |
passes.”

Linebackers Bill Wester and Jack |
Luck, an All-Stater last year, are!
the cornerstones in the Jackets’ rock |
wall defense.

Although Randolph-Macon did not |
generate much of an offensive threat |
against Millersville; Williams still,
warned:

“We have to respect Luck and
quarterback Charles D’Alessandro as
runners, and they have other boys
who can run too.” a

The Jackets’ new offense is another
point of concern for W&L.

“The lonesome end offense with
an unbalanced line is simpler to run,
but harder to plan defense for,” said
McLaughlin.

ing champions of the College Ath-
letic Conference, has been plagued
by a rash of nuisance injuries in the
last two weeks of practice.

“I think we will have everybody
except halfback Billy Andrews well
for Randolph-Macon and we hope
they will all be in good physical con-
dition,” McLaughlin said.

“The boys have been working real
hard, but don’t exactly know what
we have yet,” McLaughlin said.

On paper, however, McLaughlin
has one of his finest clubs in his
seven years at Washington and Lee
with 23 lettermen and two dozen
very promising sophomores.

So far McLaughlin has been very
impressed with the work of sopho-
mores John Kelly, Joe Miller, Larry
Craig, Tersh Baker, Bob Barclay,
John Anthony, Starke Sydnor and
Harry Brookby.

McLaughlin, who plays percent-
age football right down the line, is
preparing one surprise for the Yel-
low Jackets—a stronger passing at-
tack.

“We're not going to hesitate to
throw the ball this year, at least
until we realize we can’t,’ Mce-
Laughlin said.

“Quarterback John McDaniels has
been doing the best passing since his
freshman year. He’s been zeroing in
pretty well and he really fires the
football. A. J. Barranco is also a
good passer.”

Both McDaniel and Barranco are
seniors.

“We are not going to neglect our
running though,’ McLaughlin added.
“If we can run with success, we'll
run. If we can pass successfully,

| we'll pass.”

Halfbacks Yoffe, Henry Sackett,
Bill David and Skip Chase and full-
backs Dan Manson, Syd Butler and
Anthony are the Generals’ big guns
on the ground. In the line, Mec-
Laughlin will be counting especially
on the services of tackle Jimmie
Sylvester and ends John Madison
and Buck Ogilvie.

The Generals will be looking for-
ward to their encounter if only for
the purpose of stopping the Jacket’s
big gun, fullback Jack Luck. He
ran for the big yardage last year.

Generals Meet Randolph-Macon
To Open 1963 Football Season

By TOM DAY
Sports Editor

The Generals of Washington and
Lee open their football season on
September 28 against Randolph-
Macon Men’s College at Wilson
Field. This is a particularly signifi-
cant date in the life of head coach
Lee McLaughlin in that it marks his
seventh year as skipper of the W&L
football team. Coach McLaughlin
came to W&L in 1957 and, through
his unceasing efforts, has brought the
school back to the football respec-
tability that it once held.

A total of 65 boys have turned out
to play. Among these are several
outstanding juniors and seniors along
with some very talented sophomores.
Coach McLaughlin compares this
team to the one he fielded in 1961
and won nine and lost none. Never-
theless, the Generals face some ex- |
tremely rugged opponents and are
going to have to apply the pressure
when it is needed. A team new to
the schedule is Susquehanna Uni-
versity, a small, Pennsylvania col-
lege that is going into the 1963 sea-
son with a string of 22 consecutive
victories.

Also among the new teams the
Generals will face is Oberlin Col-

 

lege from the Ohio Conference. Back
after a year’s layoff is Washington
University who won 5 and lost 3 in
1962.

Last year the team lost only eight
men through graduation. Some of
these eight figured strongly in last
year’s 8-1 record, however. Men
like All-State tackle Bob Payne,
All-State fullback Tommy Keesee,
and quarterback Chuck Lane will be
hard to replace. Coach Mac has only
three returning lettermen at tackle,
three at quarterback, and one at
fullback.

To help solve these and other
problems, McLaughlin has many tal-
ented sophomores that he can work
with besides the experienced juniors
and seniors. “The best thing about
our sophomores is their eagerness
and dedication,’ Coach Mac says.
“We could suffer from senioritis but
with a bunch like this coming on,
we won’t worry too much. It’s pos-
sible that sophomores could unseat
some of our seasoned veterans by

| mid-season.”

McLaughlin says the Generals
will be as good offensively in 1963
as they were in 1962, if not better.
There won’t be the passing threat

THE DEAN YOU SAVE MAY BE YOUR OWN

Colleges are complicated and bewildering places, filled with
complicated and bewildering people. Today let us examine
one of the most complicated and bewildering —yet fetching and
lovable—of all campus figures. I refer, of course, to the dean
of students.

Policeman and confessor, shepherd and seer, warden and
oracle, proconsul and pal—the dean of students is all of these.
How, then, can we understand him? Well sir, perhaps the best
way is to take an average day in the life of an average dean.
Here, for example, is what happened last Thursday to Dean
Killjoy N. Damper of the Duluth College of Belles Lettres
and Pemmican.

At 6 a.m. he woke, dressed, lit a Marlboro, and went up on
the roof of his house to remove the statue of the Founder
which had been placed there during the night by high-
spirited undergraduates.

At 7 a.m. he lit a Marlboro and walked briskly to the cam-
pus. (The Dean had not been driving his car since it had been
placed on the roof of the girls dormitory by high-spirited
undergraduates.)

At 7:45 a.m. he arrived on campus, lit a Marlboro and
climbed the bell tower to remove his secretary who had been
placed there during the night by high-spirited undergraduates.

At 8 a.m. he reached his office, lit a Marlboro, and met with
K. Pluribus Ewbank, editor of the student newspaper. Young
Ewbank had been writing a series of editorials urging the
United States to annex Canada. When the editorials had
evoked no response, he had taken matters into his own hands.
Accompanied by his society editor and two proofreaders, he
had gone over the border and conquered Manitoba. With great
patience and several Marlboro Cigarettes, the Dean persuaded
young Ewbank to give Manitoba back. Young Ewbank, how-
ever, insisted on keeping Winnipeg.

At 9 a.m. the Dean lit a Marlboro and met with Robert
Penn Sigafoos, president of the local Sigma Chi chapter, who
came to report that the Deke house had been put on top of
the Sigma Chi house during the night by high-spirited under-
graduates.

At 10 a.m. the Dean lit a Marlboro and went to umpire
an intramural softball game on the roof of the law school
where the campus baseball diamond had been placed during
the night by high-spirited undergraduates.

At 12 noon the Dean had a luncheon meeting with the
prexy, the bursar, and the registrar, at the bottom of the cam-
pus swimming pool where the faculty dining room had been
placed during the night by high-spirited undergraduates.
Marlboros were passed after luncheon, but not lighted, owing
to dampness.

At 2 p.m., back in his office, the Dean lit a Marlboro and
received the Canadian Minister of War who said unless young
Ewbank gave back Winnipeg, the Canadian army would march
against the U.S. immediately. Young Ewbank was summoned
and agreed to give back Winnipeg if he could have Moose Jaw.
The Canadian Minister of War at first refused, but finally con-
sented after young Ewbank placed him on the roof of the
metallurgy building.

At 3 p.m. the Dean lit a Marlboro and met with a delega-
tion from the student council who eame to present him with
a set of matched luggage in honor of his fifty years’ service as
dean of students. The Dean promptly packed the luggage with
all his clothing and fled to Utica, New York, where he is now

in the aluminum siding game. cS

Beanies: An Absurd Tradition

(Continued from page 2)

If this year’s freshman class behaves itself, it will gain the
privilege of burning its beanies in less than three weeks.
(Here’s hoping this takes place before heavy rains come and
the cheap dye in the beanies runs all over 338coats) The
beanies need never be seen on this campus again if enough
students express to the Assimilation Committee and the Execu-
tive Committee a desire to abolish them. Beanies should follow
the way of the dodos and the dinosaurs; they should be seen
only in museums. But not the Lee Chapel museum—Robert E.
Lee was not a man who would have condoned beanies.

Last night in duPont Auditorium,
Mr. Robert Schuettinger, a doctoral
student in political theory at Ex-
eter College in Oxford, delivered a
speech on The Welfare State:
Liquidation and Progress. Mr.
Schuettinger was the guest of the
W&L Conservative Society.

The theme of Mr. Schuettinger’s
talk was that throughout the world—
and especially in England—the ten-
dency toward the welfare state is
decreasing. Mr. Schuettinger augu-
mented his lecture with examples,
particularly the results of a recent
survey conducted in England which
shows that 67 per cent of the Eng-
lish would prefer private health
insurance to the state system now
in existence.

Mr. Schuettinger went on to say
that the present system of public
welfare in this country should not
be abolished but rather reformed.
Such items of public welfare as
education, social security, and health
insurance would be made available
by the government to those who
want them, but the citizens who pre-
fer private welfare programs would

he thought this fault inherent in the
system. The remaining people who
were polled simply said that they
were too mixed up to decide.

Of the ninety-eight members of
the freshman class who did not
pledge at the end of Rush Week,
eighty-six registered with the L. F. C.
for Deferred Rush.

Although only seventy per cent
of this year’s freshman class pledged
a fraternity at the end of Rush
Week, this figure is down only five
per cent from the number who
pledged at the end of last year’s
Rush Week. Seven per cent of last
year’s freshman class pledged a
house during Deferred Rush.

that Lane provided, but both Mc-
Daniel and Barranco are effective
short passers, and the Generals have
top receivers in John Madison, Yoffe,
end Buck Ogilvie and halfback Bill
David. McLaughlin plans to con-
tinue the basic “Go-T” offense that
has proven so effective in past years.

Defensively, Coach Mac sees in
this team the stinginess that made
W&L one of the top defensive teams
in the nation in 1961. With line-
backers like Mike Sheffey, Dan
Flournoy, and Joe Miller, and out-
standing linemen as Jim Sylvester,
Gossman, Angel, and Bob Henley,
Coach Mac has every right to expect
top-flight performances.

‘You in There’
In Lee Chapel

Documentary

A 30-minute documentary about
Washington and Lee University’s
newly-restored Lee Chapel will be
shown at 7 pm. this Friday over
WDBJ (Channel 7) in Roanoke.

“Assignment Seven”

The special program, entitled “As-
signment Seven: The Lee Chapel,”
will revolve around a tour of the
historic Chapel conducted by Earl
S. Mattingly, Washington and Lee’s
Treasurer. The documentary is one
of several programs planned _ this
year by Channel 7 staff members.

Narrator for the program will be
WDBJ’s Ron MacDonald, who also
is producer of the show. The pro-
gram is under the direction of Hugh
Downing. Jerry Bartmess was cam-
erman for the project.

Rededication

The special documentary is plan-
ned to coincide with preparations
for the formal rededication of Lee
Chapel, closed since June of 1962 for
extensive restoration, was re-opened
to the public in mid-August. The
restoration project | cost st $370,000.

Dance Plans Hold Up Well

Despite Raise In Price

Ed Croft, President of this year’s
Dance Board, said today that the
Dance Board has sold some 750
Dance Plans for 1963-64 session thus
far. This turnout includes over 96
per cent of the Freshman elass.

Although this represents a marked
drop from the record high number
of 900 that were sold last year at
this time, Croft went on to say that
a decrease in the turnout had pre-
viously been expected. This, he said,
was due to the $5.00 price rise of
the coming year’s Dance Plans,
bringing the present cost of each up
to $30.00.

This year’s higher price, explained
Croft, was an inevitable step in order
that W&L might keep up with the

rising cost of entertainment and re-|

tain the high quality of performer:
that it has had in past years. He

said that the Dance Board is look-|

ing forward to one of its very best
seasons and is, at the present time
seasons.

Croft added in closing that Dance
Plans are still on Sale in the Co-op
and will be until Openings Dances;
also, that, even with this
higher price, the purchase
the biggest

money saving

When persons who consider them-

gather together to discuss contem-
porary film directors, they normally
limit the field to Antonioni, Truffaut,
Bergman, Kurosawa, Fellini, and
several others whose names I won't
bother to spell. But never have I
heard the name of John Sturges
brought up in such a discussion.
Assuming that a.) the cinema is an
art medium and b.) that the imme-

In order to explicate a good di-

commonly used to credit one of the

‘Hero of the Ineffectual’

 

Salinger Sickens Critic

By JIM LEDBETTER

If one reads Time magazine,
one knows that J. D. Salinger
was the champion of the Ameri-
ean set until quite recently
when William Golding took his
place. Without doubting this
premise, it is easy to see why
Salinger has been ousted; his
last two collections of paired short
stories a la New Yorker remind
this reviewer of a fraternity
brother who was doing quite well
this weekend until he barfed.

There are two stories in the
volume in question. The title
story deserves little attention.
It can be read enjoyably if
one is in Salinger’s in-group
out-group, an organization that
might well borrow the name of
this group we see posters for
around the campus, the Society

seems to work from a_ formula,
which he stringently observes. Take
two or more popular stars, add an
easily recognizable and supporting
cast, get Elmer Bernstein to write
the music, have the author write
amusing and clever dialogue, put in
plenty of varied action, and most
important, use color. Amazing as it
may seem, it works. |
The Great Escape” |

Sturges has done these things in|
the “Great Escape.” His popular
stars are James Garner (much more
suited to this role than he was for
the parts he played in the “Chil-
dren’s hour,’ or the more recent
“Thrill of It All’), Steve McQueen,
and Richard Attenborough. The sup-
porting cast includes Charles Bron-
son, James Coburn, James Donald,
ete. The action is concerned with
the induction of over 250 allied es-
cape specialists, garnered from many
different German P.O.W. camps.
and their combined effort to pull off

 

Of all the films I saw this summer,
none was more enjoyable. It is brisk-
ly directed, competently acted, and
usually quite amusing. It is a cred-
itable example of a good Holly-
wood movie. I am able io guarantee
several hours of entertainment. (Un-
conditionally.)

“David and Lisa”

Beginning at the Lyric Sunday is
“David and Lisa” which one week-

ly publication called the best Amer-
ican film of of 1962, and which, of

of Individualists; a self-contra-
diction, needless to say, but a
fact that doesn’t seem to both-
er the members.

But the piece that occasions
this overflow of bitterness is one
that, unhappily, is meant to be
the cornerstone of Salinger’s
work: Seymour—an introduction.

Perhaps we should begin with
the Glass family. In his earliest
collection, which was very fine,
Salinger included a story called
“A Perfect Day for Banana Fish.”
The main character, Seymour
Glass, lays out on the beach
awhile, talks to a little kid, and
then goes up to his hotel room
and shoots himself in the head.
It was a good story.

Unhappily, this character
grew in Salinger’s mind to ma-
jor proportions. A whole family
grew up around Seymour, came
to life, and appeared in print—
and this is all we have heard
of Salinger since. No superla-
tive can be wasted on the Glass
family; they speak yea many
languages, take over a TV quiz
program, and think about
things so profound that Salinger
can’t even write them down.

I hate to psychoanalyze a writ-
er, but it seems that Salinger, who
is really the hero of the ineffect-
ual, has created the family he
would like to be, and the person
he would most like to be in that
family. And he has found that
it is quite simple to indicate that
Seymour can speak Sanskrit and
Japanese simply by putting it
down on paper; to say that Sey-
mour has written the century’s
greatest poems is the easiest thing
in the world. Unfortunately, in
the case of the poems, his widow
will not allow them to be pub-
lished for some reason; but we
just knew they are great. And
of course, the whole thing is there
are no poems; Salinger only
wishes there were.

In fact, Salinger does not suc-
ceed in becoming Seymour at all,
but rather his brother, Buddy,
who bears a striking resemblance
to Salinger himself: a hermit who
sits out in a shack in the woods
and writes; who has written a
book about a prep-school type
(The Catcher in the Rye) and
who has even written “A Perfect
Day for Banana Fish.” It is he
who is telling us all about the
greatness of Seymour, but un-
fortunately he gets so choked up
that he can’t even express him-
self clearly, though we know that
he should be able to since he is
a genius—who has read ten

Theatre in Color and Panavision.

By BERT PHILLIPS
Special Features Editor

Facing the sea there was a crooked line of naked men,
heads and shoulders drooped indifferently, faces unshaven.
No one spoke.

He was the third person in from the water-line, standing
by himself; but then, everyone else in the line was alone.
The sand which stuck to his legs made him think uncertainly
that he had been in the water before and then perhaps laid
down and slept, but he couldn’t remember. It didn’t bother
him though, and he was not particularly surprised to be
standing in the line with the others. He looked and could
recognize only one. This also caused him no concern.

The men were dirty, not with mud or clay, but instead
with soot, as if they had spent their entire lives in some
huge, deserted fireplace. No one ever turned around to
see what was behind, and they didn’t shiver or perspire,
for they were neither hot nor cold. There was silence, and
even in their minds there was no noise. Blank minds, neither
worrying, nor wondering.

In front of the line and off to the right stood the Bird-
man, speaking to them and at the same time rocking back
on his heels and then forward on his toes. His rhetoric was
dull... monotonous. This creature seemed to feel he was
above the situation and was weary of giving the same in-
structions over and over again. Perhaps he had been doing it
for many years, rocking from foot to foot, pausing to say
“uh” occasionally, and then proceeding with his head
rolling rhythmically from side to side, causing his eyes to
swing back and forth as if they were marbles dropped into
the bottom of a teacup.

The Birdman was about ten feet tall. His body was
blue-green, but his wings, which he held out to his side,
dangling as if they were the arms of a human, were gold
and maroon. His head was shaven and white and contrasted
sharply with the ever-moving black eyes and long, ebony
beak. Talking in his slow, dull voice, the Birdman said the
same thing to each of the naked men as they came to the

edge of the lapping waves.
Behind the creature the calm sea appeared to stretch

 

 
   
 
  

 

(Continued on page 4) (Continued on page 4)

forever and then at some unreal place to flow into the mist.
The sky was steely colored and no clouds were discernable,
only the grey mist which the sun could not hope to pene-
trate. The sun’s rays were diffused and lost like the small
beam of a flashlight which reaches out hopelessly for the
moon. The mist was everywhere and the sun was nowhere,
and the sea did not reflect light, but instead seemed to con-
sume it. There were no gulls or flies as there are at other
beaches.

He stood on the sand next to the massive, unconcerned
Birdman. Naked and completely alone, and now afraid of
the vast unknown which he faced. It was his turn now, and

the Birdman had moved on and was reciting to the stranger
who stood in line behind him.

How could he be afraid of something that he was com-
pletely ignorant of? But his neck and shoulders were taunt
as a hunted animal and he instinctively put his hand to his
mouth where his teeth sunk into the bleeding nails and the
dying flesh.

There was no breeze, no salt in the air. He wondered
why there was no salt in the air. Maybe there was none in
the water; perhaps this was not the sea. The sea is supposed
to be blue and this water was very green. His mind skipped
from thought to thought and memory to memory. And he
was so completely uncertain about what the Birdman had
said. How could he know what was the signal for him to
dive? And the sea was so very green. Everywhere was a
ghastly, lurking, lapping greeness with white foam and

That’s the International Society for
Individualists. It does seem rather
curious, and a sign of the times, that
now even “individualists” organize.
Friday
Sept. 27, 1963
Today I saw a freshman, bedecked
in beanie, carefully walk out of his
way in order to stay on the side-
walks and off the grass; then I saw
a sockless, coatless upperclassman
ignore the freshman’s greeting.

 

All the efforts of the Assimilation
Committee, it seems, are wasted
when one upperclassman show flag-
rant disregard for the Traditions be-
fore a freshman.

Those who left the football game
early today made a mistake. Granted
the first three quarters were real-
ly rather dull, but the last quarter—
the last five minutes, actually—made
up for it.

It was encouraging to notice, how-
ever, that more people than usual
stayed for a good portion of the
game.

Sunday
Sept. 29, 1963

Attendance at the Commons
breakfast this morning was sparse,
with a few stragglers groping for
tomato juice.

The freshmen are evidently be-
coming assimilated into the tradi-
tion of W&L weekends at record
speed.

black lines where white foam met green liquid. And why
wasn’t there any salt? He couldn’t understand why he had
to dive. The Birdman had not told him, but perhaps it
was because everyone else has to dive also. But why did
everyone else have to dive? It was all so puzzling. . .

Now he was so alone. Nobody was around him. No peo-
ple, no air, no sun; only the grey mist and the green liquid.
Not even the Birdman any more.

Almost falling instead of flying, the black form swooped
down. The Messenger was black and large, and he under-
stood that this was the signal.

He never hesitated, even though the Birdman said the
fish would destroy him, and he dreaded the grey sharks.
They would come from behind, slowly catching him and
teasing always. Menacing and grey in the eternal greenness.
But he never once wavered.

The sea was neither warm nor cold, but instead, the
temperature of his blood. It deepened very quickly, and
he dived, realizing that he could never come back to the
surface. And the Birdman had been so unconcerned about
it all, and his instructions seemed so senseless, and if not
senseless, then instead so very useless. For what if he did find
It in the greenness’ How cold he save It from the depths if
the Birdman had told him he could never return?

He wondered if anyone else who had been in the line
was now floundering in the green sea. Now he thought
about the men in the crooked line who had touched their
bodies to his. They had all been naked and stood together,
but they were so alone even when their pale bodies had met.
They had never talked.

He turned in the water as the Birdman had told him and
swam, pulling and kicking, and looking constantly for the
Thing he had been sent to find but which he had never
seen. He knew if he saw It, he would understand what to
do. But how could he save it from the everlasting greenness?

In the end the sharks did not destroy him. The fish
that finally caught him from behind were blue ones which
latched themselves onto his white body and covered it until
the pale skin was no longer discernable, and only a blue
form was left writhing in the profound greenness.

McLaughlin’s Charges Gain 28-0

Verdict Over ’ Jackets; Yoffe Star

By JIM CROTHERS
Assistant Sports Editor

After a defensive first-half, Washington and Lee opened up and scored |,
22 points in the third and fourth quarters Saturday while overcoming |

Randolph-Macon, 28-0, on the victor’s Wilson Field.
Led by All CAC halfback Stuart Yoffe and junior,

Macon’s scant 128 yards. Yoffe scored twice on runs of 13 and 6 yards for
Washington and Lee’s first two tal-*

 

Bill David, the|'
Generals amassed a total of 254 offensive yards as compared to Randolph- ||

 

 

lies while carrying the pigskin 16)
times and picking up a total of 83
yards.

David celebrated his twenty-first
birthday by snagging two passes for
36 yards—one a 27-yard scoring
play from A. J. Barranco for W&L’s
final touechdown—and averaging 41
yards per runback on three Yellow
Jacket punts. The speedy halfback
also starred on defense by recov-
ering a Randolph-Macon fumble and
by making a fantastic leaping inter-
ception.

The other General scores came on
a five-yard fullback plunge by
Syd Butler and a couple of two
point extra-point conversions. Hen-
ry Sackett, who carried the football
64 yards in 10 attempts in one of
the afternoon’s standout perform-
ances, scored the first two-pointer
in the fourth quarter while a Bar-
ranco-to-Mike Jenkins pass ac-
counted for the final two points.

Coach McLaughlin said he was
generally favorably impressed and
that he felt the W&L mistakes came
from over-anxiety than from mental
lapses. The coach also expressed his
satisfaction at the way the General
offense adjusted to the new Yellow
Jacket defenses.

Frosh Football Team)
Loses To Woodberry)

In Initial Game, 28-O

By DAVE SHUFFLEBARGER
Tuesday Sports Editor
“We're not disappointed after an
opener like that,’ Coach Dana Swan
said after his
dropped a 28-0 decision to Wood-

berry Forest .

Despite the score, Coach Swan
and his aides are pleased with the
promising showing of almost all of
the team. In their initial contest
on Saturday, the Baby Generals
faced a Woodberry team that had
one game under its belt already.
Playing at home, Woodberry scored
once in each quarter, successfully
kicking the extra point each time.

One of the high spots for the W&L
frosh was the fine timing shown by
the offensive backfield. Swan said
that exceptional performances were
turned in by guard Bryant Ken-
drick, Logan Bullet, and Warren
Stuart .

Last week the team elected Roger
Milam, Kendrick, and Ben Gambill
as their tri-captains.

Friday the frosh take on Staunton,
a team that downed E. C. Glass last
week. Staunton’s problem, similar
to the Baby Generals’, is a lack of
speed. The military boys have gone
to bigger and stronger backs in
place of the scatbacks of the past.
This, coupled with an always potent
line, could make Staunton a hard
nut to crack.

A lot of the frosh football trouble
was first-game jitters. In viewing
the films, I found that most of
Woodberry’s success was due to
W&L mistakes. It’s hard for any
football player to completely switch
system, as most of the frosh have
done, with the W&L go-T and 5-4

defense.

~ Our Athletic Policy

Washington and Lee’s non-subsi-
dized athletic program has been in
effect since June, 1954 when the
University’s Board of Trustees de-
emphasized athletics. The trustees
in their 1954 decision said that no
more athletic grants-in-aid or
“scholarships” would be extended,
and that all athletic activities, in-
cluding intercollegiate sports, intra-
murals and physical education, would
be incorporated under one depart-| to
ment and one director. There is
no so-called “major” and “minor”
sports distinction at W&L.

The eight-year-old policy is based
on these considerations:

Intercollegiate athletics have a
proper place in the general program
of a college or university such as
Washington and Lee. This role, how-
ever, should not be compromised in
such a | way tht the best interests of

the University become secondary to
the interests of outside influences.

While college sports might be of

great interest to the general public,
the creation of public spectacles
should not be a goal of the Univer-
sity’s intercollegiate athletic pro-
gram. The value derived from a
sports program by the students is the
only real measure of success for
intercollegiate athletics at Washing-
ton and Lee.

SHUFFLIN’ ALONG

By DAVE SHUFFLEBARGER

With only Bob Lathrop’s frosh soccer team untested,
W&L’s Fall inter-collegiate sports program appears to be well
on its way towards at least a repitition of last year’s outstanding
ledger.

In 1962, the booters wound up third in the state,
W&L football fans crowed over an 8-1 mark, and pipe-smok-
ing mentor Dick Miller “harried” his cross-country charges to
a 7-2 record. Both the freshman soccer and football teams,
although not posting earth-shaking ledgers, did fine jobs of
training as witnessed by the large number of sophomores who
have been in the spotlight this year.

 

The baby booters open a tough seven-game slate at Lynch-
burg Thursday and Lathrop, a former star himself, will field
a group of frosh that could earn a 4-3 record after it’s all over.

Even though the three varsity teams all won their openers,

| Cross Country Squad

Notches 18-45 Victory

| Over Roanoke College

By LARRY CRAIG
Tuesday Sports Writer

Andy Kilpatrick and Riff O’Con-
nor left all competitors in their dust
Saturday afternoon as they placed
one-two respectively in the cross-
country meet with Roanoke Col-
lege. The W&L team smashed Roa-
noke by the score of 18-45.

Kilpatrick and O’Connor, well
out in front at the finish, tried to

finish in a dead heat, but the
judges awarded first to W&lL’s
captain.

Coach Dick Miller was very

pleased with the entire team’s effort,
pointing out that Roanoke placed
only one runner in the top eight
finishers. The times, coach Miller
said, were pjleasantly surprising
for this early in the season; and he
believes better times are within
reach of Kilpatrick and O’Connor as
both took the last quarter in an un-
hurried jog. The coach also empha-
sized the excellent over-all balance
of this year’s team; and in this
balance, he places his hopes for a
good record.

The runners duel a strong Lynch-
burg team this Friday and another
tea meffort equal or better than
Saturday’s will be necessary in or-
der for the boys to emerge vic-
torious.

Last season Roanoke won the first
two places, but the Generals copped
the next 11 for a hard earned vic-
tory. The Generals showed a season’s
mark of seven wins, two losses in

 

going. Just before the end of the half
Preben Berthelsen broke loose from
the defense to score the winners’
first goal.

The Generals came out to start
the second half with great deter-
mination, which paid off. Bruce
Jackson scored midway in the third
period with a beautiful shot from
about 90 feet to tie the score. With
about 40 seconds remaining in the
period Chris Clarke slammed in the
winning goal.

The fourth quarter was a defensive
battle as neither team was able to
score. Tom Green, the Generals’
outstanding goalie, came through
in fine fashion to protect the slim
lead with several saves in that per-
iod.

Jackson played an outstanding
game for the winners, as he was all
over the field. Tim Henry was credit-
ed with two assists to aid the cause.
Actually, anyone of the team could
be singled out for his fine play as
it was a great team effort.

The only dark note of the game
for W&L .was tht freshman Fred
Skinner, the only freshman who ac-
companied the team on the trip,
twisted his ankle after playing only
a few minutes. The severity of the
injury has not been determined yet,
but Skinner is on crutches.

The Generals next game will be
at W&L Friday at 3:15 against Ran-
dolph-Macon. If the Generals get
another good team effort, they
should be able to handle the visitors
from Ashland, Virginia.

Until this story Salinger had
established his position as the
finest first-person narrator since
Hemingway. Yet writing in the
first person opens way for many
dangers. The ingratiating manner
of a Holden Caulfield can easily
turn into the sort of sickening in-
nuendo that the New Yorker
loves so. In this story Salinger
falls into each danger and it is
almost unreadable. In fact it is,
unless you have to write a re-
vie wof it; trust me.

Philliaps will write a critical re-
view of Salinger’s book, taking the
opposite point of view from Led-
better’s.)

sentimental, often lacking in imag-
nation, and too much of a surface
romance. Though the direction is
effective and the photography ex-
cellent, it is not a great film. It is
simply a good one.

|Dana Swan is not the least discouraged over his freshman
| football loss to Woodberry Forest. “We have to teach every
‘boy a new system, and I think they’re learning it faster than
can be expected,” Swan said.

This may sound funny, but the truth of the matter s that
Swan’s team was allowed six fewer practices this year than
ever before due to a very busy Fall schedule.

If Coach Lyle’s front line and a few plucky reserves hold
out, the varsity soccer team should end up with a fairly good
season, but ngt quite as good as last year’s. It took some fine
pressure play for the Generals to pull out a 3-2 win over Pfeif-
er.

After a slow start the gridiron worriors romped to victory
over the Jackets, but a couple of injuries marred the triumph.
Right tackle, Jim Slyvester has sustained a broken blood ves-
sel in his foot and may be out for the Oberlin game. Ace
halfback Stu Yoffe could ride the bench just for safety’s sake
due to a pulled muscle in his lower right leg, the same one that
bothered him last year.

OLYMPICS SIGNED FOR COCKTAIL PARTY

Discusses

Wilderness As Theme

By P. R. COCKSHUTT, JR.

William Humphrey, noted novelist
and short story writer and Glasgow
Visiting Professor at Washington and
Lee, discussed the recurring wilder-
ness theme in American literature in
a lecture presented last evening in
the newly renovated Lee Chapel.

The lecture, entitled “Ah Wilder-
ness,” was the first of four public
addresses Humphrey is to give dur-
ing his stay in Lexington this semes-
ter.

Pointing to the absence of any real
heroines in American literature, Mr.
Humphrey suggested that our’s
basically a “bachelor literature, and
a backwoods bachelor literature at
that.”

He proceeded to discuss in some
detail The Leatherstocking Tales of
James Fenimore Cooper, and the
novels’ chief character, Natty Bum-
po, whom Mr. Humphrey character-
ized as a “celibate knight of the
forest.” The speaker sees the Leath-
erstocking series Cooper’s de-
nunciation of the wasteful and des-
troying effect encroaching civiliza-
tion has on nature.

is

as

Mr. Humphrey went on to say that
while historians usually picture this
nation’s westward expansion as part
of the fulfillment of our national
destiny, novelists have chosen to
look upon this expansion as an es-
cape from the fetters of civilized so-
ciety. Consequently, Mr. Humphrey
said, the heroes of our literature are
by nature anti-social. “They are
‘loners’ who lack the Rotarian spirit
and have only a sweeping ‘nay!’ for
all this democratic togetherness we
think of as American.”

Turning to Thoreau as a kind of
philosophical father to this primi-
tivist movement in American liter-
erature, Mr. Humphrey compared
the thought of the hermit of Walden
Pond with that of Rousseau, who
claimed that man is born good, but
is corrupted by society.

The speaker went on to discuss
Mark Twain’s Huckleberry Finn, the
writings of Jack Kerouac, Herman
Melville, Ernest Hemingway, and
finally, William Faulkner to further
illustrate his thesis that the wilder-
ness theme is and always has been|
of crucial importance in American|
literature.

An informal reception for the au-

 

thor followed the lecture in the

East Lounge of the Evans Dining
Hall.

Mr. Humphrey scheduled to
speak again on the evening of No-
vember 14. His talk has been tenta-
tively entitled “Novelists and Story-
teller.”

The current issues of the Atlantic
Monthly and Esquire magazine con-

is

tain two of Mr. Humphrey’s own
latest short stories. The author’s
other published works _ include

Home From the Hill, a novel, and
The Last Husband, a volume of short
stories.

W&L ‘Mink’ Transfers, Becomes VMI ‘Rat’

The Roanoke Times |
Early in September, John Joseph |
Folan, Jr., returned to Lexington |
for his second year of college here.
But instead of re-enrolling at}
Washington and Lee University |
where he had spent his freshman|
term, the 19-year-old Norwood,
Mass., native moved across town to
neighboring Virginia Military Insti-
tute.

He is the first Washington and
Lee man since 1937 to do so
And after nearly one month on

the campus Folan reported:

“Jay’- his VMI W&L
friends call him—has become some-
thing of a celebrity at both schools. |
According to Folan:

‘There’s that “mink” (the ‘affection-
ate’ label cadets have given W&L
students) that transferred here.’ ”

At W&L—Last spring, “They
(W&L classmates) didn’t believe I
was going to do it. And are they
surprised to see me now in a VMI
uniform!”

Folan has difficulty in pinpointing
his main reasons for desiring the
transfer.

“IT had once wanted to attend a
military prep school,” he reflected.
And at present, “I am seriously con-
sidering making the military service
my career.”

And at this point, although Fol-
an was forced to accept a “fourth
classman” or freshman academic
standing as he lacked certain nec-
essary credits to become a_ third
classman, he is “not disillusioned”
about his decision.

He says he is far from the perfect
soldier and that in the very near
future “you may see me walking
penalty tours.” Such punishment be- |
gins after a cadet accumulates an
excess number of demerits.

“But that’s part of military life,”

Folan continued, had been

warned of it

saying he

When Folan applied to the VMI
director of admissions last spring,
Col. Arthur M. Lipscomb, Jr., told
|the W&l, freshman that he would
face “no free and easy life’ ‘at VMI.

Col. Lipscomb reealled, “I wasn’t
| trying to discourage him, though;
I felt that it was for his own good.”

Col. Lipscomb said tht several

years ago, a W&L freshman inquired
about a possible transfer

 

to VMI.|

He was a freshman in his first se-
mester. Lipscomb said, and “I ad-
vised him not to do anything pre-|
maturely;” whereupon the student|
remained at W&L and is a candidate |
for graduation there this year.
The admissions offices of both
institutions report that although
indeed rare, transfers from VMI
to W&L are “much more frequent”
than vice versa. One cadet, after
two years at the institute, changed
to Washington and Lee this year.

As opposed to his predecessor of |
26 years back, however, Folan said
he wanted to attend VMI.

As he in his barracks room
and diligently shined the brass hat
shield, Folan discussed what he
termed a “sincere admiration” for
VMI.

There was time, he
that he had heard of the institute

It was at this time that Folan, as-
to become a cadet, visited
the VMI admissions office. He said
Gen. Lloyd Davidson, dean of the
faculty, “told me I probably had a
chance to see the institute
than any other
ever entered here.”

later, as he did not take certain
courses at Washington and Lee that
VMI fourth-classmen need in order
to advance to a third-class ranking.

Currently in what is almost a uni-

que position, Folan in speaking of
the two schools was able to con-
clude:

“I think good relations (between
W&L and VMI) are important—
we're in the same town, and using
the same facilities,

“There appears to be a mutual re-

spect between the two; there is cer-
no great rivalry (athletic con-

Lee ended long ago). There

Products Of Frisch, Marlowe and Shaw

It concerns the well-known apathy
of modern man to the destructive
and evil forces in the world today.
Some have also seen in the play, a
warning by Frisch to his Swiss com-
patriots to beware in particular the
Communist evil.

This production will run Nov. 6-9.

By way of commemorating the

/ 400th anniversary of the birth of

the two greatest tragic playwrights
in the English language Christopher
Marlowe and William Shakespeare,
the Troubs will produce Marlowe's
best known work, The Tragical His-
tory of Dr. Faustus. The theatre also
now plans a Shakespearian produc-
tion for the fall of 1964.

Marlowe’s lines are, of course,
credited with establishing blank
verse as the poetic foundation of
inglish tragedy. And in Faustus he
created the figure who has come to
typify the search of Renaissance
man. This show is scheduled to be
presented March 518.

As the final production this sea-
son, the theatre has chosen Ber-
nard Shaw’s Androcles and the Lion.
This, too is a fable play but of a
different kind from Biedermann. It
is high comedy.

The familiar legend of man and
beast is treated by Shaw here. But
as with all legends used by Shaw,
it is highly modified. This spring
production is slated for April 29-
May 2.

Hollins Is Host |

Hollins College will be hostess to
a group of W&L students this Sun-
day afternoon,

The meeting will launch a series
of get-togethers to take place dur-
ing the year for the purpose of dis-
cussion. The program adminis-
tered under the auspices of the Uni-
versity Christian Association.

A similar program has been estab-
lished with Sweet Briar and Ran-
dolph-Macon Woman’s College. The
representatives to these colleges are
now being organized and students
who

is

are interested may contact Ken
Lane, UCA vice-president.
The discussion groups were ini-|

tiated two years ago by represen-

purpose of the program is to
strengthen the liaison between W&L |
and neighboring girls’ colleges.

President Moore

Appoints Veeps

By LEWIS MILLER
The Olympics, nationally famous
recording stars, have been selected
by John Moore, President of Open-
ings Dance Weekend, to appear at
the Openings cocktail party spon-
sored by the Sophomore class. Ac-
companying the Olympics will be
Guitar Kimber and the Untouch-
ables. Date and time of the cocktail
party will be Friday, October 19,
from four to six in the evening. As
in the past, the Pine Room of the
Mayflower Motor Hotel will be used

to accommodate the crowd.

Bourbon and Scotch
Breaking away from the traditional
grain punch, mixed drinks of Bour-
bon and Scotch will be served. Mem-
bers of the student body and their
dates are invited to attend the first
cocktail party of the school year.

Announced

Along with the announcement of
the cocktail party entertainment,
John Moore, President of the Soph-
omore class, has announced the ap-
pointment of seven vice-presidents
for Openings Weekend.

Chuck Griffin, SAE, is the official
coordinator for the weekend. Rob
Vaughn, Delt, is in charge of the
decorations for the Friday night
dance and the Saturday night con-
cert. Steve Yancy, Beta, will handle
the arrangements for the figure at
the Friday dance. Dave Sufflebarger,
PiKA, and Chip Roadman, Phi Gam,
are in charge of the invitations which
will be sent to friends of the Uni-

Vice-Presidents

xVersity, the faculty, and the digni-

taries of Lexington. Lewis Miller,
Phi Delt, is the Publicity chairman
for Openings Weekend. Lindsay
Short, Delt, is in charge of the cock-
tail party.
The Olympics

The Olympics, for the last five
years, have been one of the most
successful rock and roll singing
groups in the country, their songs
have consistently been at, or near,
the top of the national record polls.
The Olympics, singing in a style re-
sembling the Coasters, first received
acclaim with their single release of
“Western Movies.”

Since then, the Olympics have
recorded such hits as “Big Boy
Pete,’ and “The Bounce.” Their
most recent release, “Dancin’ Hol-
iday,” is still listed in the top one
hundred songs in the nation. Aside
from their single releases, the
Olympics have recorded three
best selling albums.

Guitar Kimber and the Untouch-
ables are well known in both the
individual, and back-up field. Reggie
“Guitar” Kimber, as the name sug-
gests, is an accomplished guitarist,
styling himself after Bo Diddley
and Chuck Berry. Both the Olym-
pics and Guitar Kimber appeared
on campus last Finals and were a
tremendous success in n Red Square.

 

Sazeracs Group

Holds Audition

Washington and Lee’s ten-year-
old social singing fraternity, the
Sazeracs, has held try-outs during
the past week to fill its few vancan-
cies. John Baker, business manager
of the Sazeracs, has announced that

the group still needs baritones and
tenors, however.
Each year the social calendar of

the Sazeraes is crowned by a spring
trip to Palm Beach, Florida, where
for the past two years the group has
had engagements at the Taboo Club,
one of the most outstanding clubs
in the city. Last year the Sazeracs
also gave private concerts for the
prince and princess of Austria as
well as for Zsa Zsa Gabor.

engagements last year in-
cluded concerts at Sweet Briar, Mary

Suggestion Follows Criticism

As a follow-up to last week’s editorial against beanies, the
Friday Edition this week ventures a suggested replacement for
the kiddie caps. There are many different methods of identi-
fying a man as a freshman; if one of these is used to replace
the beanie, it should be one which accomplishes the same
purpose while lending some dignity to the process. A method
which fulfills these requirements very well is to have the fresh-
men wear name tags of the same type they wear to the recep-
tion at the President’s home. These tags, which are made for
the use of the alumni association, fit handily into a gentleman’s
front coat pocket. They could be covered with plastic to make
them more durable.

The cards would carry the advantage of identifying a
freshman by name, not just by class. If identification really
is the purpose of the beanie, then the cards are an improve-
ment. Lower cost is still another advantage of cards over
beanies

Beanies could be discarded without losing any traditional
value. Their demise involves a question not of principle but of
policy. Nothing could be simpler than for the student govern-
ment to initiate the use of identification cards next year, thereby
improving the freshman assimilation program and ridding the
W&L campus of its most ridiculous sight.

Can We Pick It Up?

Despite the splendid performance of the Generals last
Saturday, freshmen and visitors spectating their first WeL
game must have felt they were attending a funeral service.
The lack of cheering and enthusiasm was downright disgusting.

The Five Stars have every right to our postive backing.
They slave hard in preparing for these games and from a self-
interest point of view, the time they sacrifice could be more
pleasantly spent dating or flicking out. : ;

Realizing the emergency of this need, the Varsity Club is
sectioning off the seats behind the band just for those who want
to cheer. This section is only for that hardy breed who think
they can hold up under the strain; the peace-loving or shy
spectators are advised to move to one side.

To give added inspiration to this elite of students and dates,
cheerleaders are being solicited from Southern Seminary.

For those of you who feel hesitant to join this movement,
we venture a warning: if your date doesn’t find any excitement
at W&L football games, she might give you up for a Wahoo!

this unfortunate conflict between
Church and state might never have

honest with himself must admit that
there is no such thing as the pro-
hibition of prayer. Surely the God
these men describe can take care of
Himself, and it is to be hoped that
he takes care of His own.

Certainly Christianity will not
stand or fall because the Bible is
no longer read in class rooms each

But it does seem evident that un-

well fall in the face of its own blind
hypocrisy, the victim of an internal

I sense a curious inconsistency,
perhaps even hypocrisy, in the re-
cent statements of some of our right-
wing ideologues. They claim, on the
one hand, that when it comes to
civil rights legislation, “you can’t
legislate morals.” Then on the issue
of prayers and Bible reading in the
public schools, they turn full circle

of our Federal government is en-

undermine America’s Christian her-

These self-styled “Patriotic
Christian Americans” absurdly
claim that the Supreme Court of
the United States “has put the
Negroes in the schools and taken
God out.” But when we examine
their complaint more carefully we
can see how two-faced it really is.

How can intelligent men claim that
they see no moral or religious issues
at stake in the deprivation of hu-
man rights to a portion of our popu-
lation? And how can these same
men suddenly become pillars of the
Church, modern-day Christian sol-
diers, if you will, on such a com-
paratively superficial issue as these
state-imposed religious exercises.
Could this be a form of sub-con-

By REN MANNING

For three students at W&L this
year college life is especially com-
plex and trying. In addition to the
already difficult curriculum and
scholastic requirements, these three
men find themselves suddenly
thrown into a completely different
type of society. The three foreign
representatives here this year are
Preben Berthelsen from Aalborg,
Denmark, Anders Henricsson from
Stockholm, Sweden, and Giancarlo
Marchetti from Rome, Italy.

The main difference between their
universities back home and W&L is
that here social life is intertwined

such as fraternities in their uni-
versities; nor do the students live
there at college, as they do here.
Their one purpose is education. Even
in this field the classes differ from
ours. They voluntarily attend lec-
tures and when they feel that they
know the material, they take the
exam.

is that they have been impressed
by everyone’s friendliness and un-
derstanding toward them. Carlo, as
he is known here, also has com-
mented about the honesty of every-
one.

Rach has at first found some diffi-
culty in understanding professors
during their lectures, but say that
now it seems easier for them. Hav-
ing to think and talk English all
the time definitely improves their |
comprehensibility.

Preben Berthelsen

Preben is presently taking two!
junior and thre

 

e sophomore courses. |
Along with English he is taking
American Civilization, American Lit-
erature, History, and Political Sci-
ence. He has had four years of
English and two of English Litera-
ture. He applied to the International
Institute of Education to come to
an American school. On the basis
of his knowledge of the English
language, he was selected and found |
out he was coming in April. He ar-
rived in the States early in Sep-
tember and visited New York City,

Anders Henriesson

Anders has attended thé Univers-
ity of Stockholm for one year, but
has studied English for nine. Like
Preben he is on the soccer team.
The Honor System has made the
biggest impact on him during his
first few weeks here. He comments,
“I think it’s wonderful to live under |
such a system. I never thought that
such a system exists anywhere in
the world where you can trust
everybody and have people trust
you.”

He said that he enjoyed rush
week, meeting all the people and
getting a chance to learn about the
American way of college life. Like
Preben and Carlo, he was impressed
by everyone’s friendliness to him
and their understanding. He said
you could talk to teachers more
easily here than in Sweden. In

Giancarlo Marchetti has attended
the University of Rome for a year
before he came here. When he re-

will study law there two more years
before going into the profession. By
concentrating on law, he can finish
his requirements much faster than
one can over here.

Although he has only taken Eng-
lish for four years, he got his schol-
arship on the basis of his knowledge
of the English language and his
ability to speak it. He explains his

The Great Escape is super-enter-

tension and melodrama of a Holly-
wood war thriller with all the trim-
mings—and who doesn’t? In its cate-
gory, it is matched in my memory
only by Stalag 17 and The Counter-
feit Traitor. Yet the suspense that
Sturges so skillfully manipulates
betrays itself when compared to the
other—and — greater—escape _ that
opens Sunday at the Lyric. David
and Lisa touches something so deep
in the human psyche that its senario
becomes a very personal matter.
Who has not been mentally ill for
a few moments (or hours) at one

 

time or another? Who is so sophis-
ticated as to spurn the relief that
comes when you know that some-
one very close understands you as
you really want to be understood?
When David and Lisa reach this
catharsis, their fulfillment bursts
on the audience in a cataract of
empathy; it is a unfortunate person
indeed who cannot find it within
his own artificiality to share their
happiness. I am not prepared to
agree with foreign critics who said
that we cracked the art barrier with
this film but it is nice to have the
Perrys seriously discussed in the
company of Bergman, Fellini, ete.
There are greater movies, but they
have not come in the last decade
from American sources. See both
ef these escapes. For me, the first
exploits the senses, the second heals
them.

due to the fact that over there
they teach more grammar than con-
versation. In addition, he spent a
summer in England.

He is taking Political Science,
French, American Literature, Amer-
ican History, Sociology and English
259. Although he has confessed some
difficulty in understanding all the
lectures, he feels optomistic about
increasing his understanding as he
becomes more adjusted to his classes
and professors.

Like Anders, Carlo has been very
much impressed with the honor sys-
tem here. Of it he says, “Yes, it is
strong, you know, but then, it is
necessary for a society such as this
one here.”

Carlo does not see much differ-
ence between Italian girls and
American girls. He says, “Love is
the same all over when you really
look at it.” However, he remarks
that he has found American girls
especially gentle and understanding.
“You can’t take anything away from
Italian girls, though.”

This year marks the first year in
which foreign students have both
lived and eaten in fraternity houses.
The policy in the past has been for
the students to live in the dormitory
and eat at various houses. The
change was made to allow the stu-
dents to become better acquainted
with W&lL. life.

to them anyway, for these are the
new “13” Club initiates. Unfortu-
nately they will be putting on a one

next week.

As everyone knows the fabled
Mongolian Minks will sit this one out
in the stands again this year. Despite
heavy losses by graduation the
Minks are looking forward to an-
other fine year under the new caliph,
Scary McFall. Because of the natur-
al rivalry between the school’s two
most beloved and respected organ-
izations, it seems a shame to have
this worthwhile group confined to
the shadows of the stands rather than
the bright sunlight of the playing
field. Oh well, carry on a noble tra-
dition 13ers, the Minks may stage
a comeback between halves of the

Coach Lyles Introduces Bootmen
To New Platoon System For R-MC

This Friday Coach Lyles’ soccer
men hope to continue on their win-
ning ways against Randolph-Macon.
Last week’s 3-2 victory over Pfeif-

fer made it two wins in a row, the}
first being a 3-0 win over Randolph- |
Macon in the state tournament last

season. In another game earlier in
the season Washington and Lee beat
Randolph-Macon 4-0 in an
game.

In light of Washington and Lee’s
slow start last week, which found
Pfeiffer with a 2-0 lead in the sec-
ond quarter, Lyles has worked the
team hard in an attempt to improve

conditioning and sharpen all around | {

performance.

Lyles will put to work his platoon
system this week for the first time
along with his usual shifting of
players to different positions. Ber-

thelsen and Kilpatrick will form a)

relief platoon for the other two in-
siders Clark and Sweet. In the back-
field Darden, Warner, Jackson, and
Horner will combine in two half
platoons.

With only six extra men on the
team this system is very useful as
the team works well with each com-
bination. The other two reserves are
at full back and goalie.

The outlook is promising this week

The Generals of Washington and
meet the Crimson and Gold

Yeomen of Oberlin this Saturday |

2 p.m. This is the second game for
both teams. Last Saturday the Ober-
lin team suffered a crushing 52-0

defeat at the hands of Hiram College, |

possibly one of the best small col-
lege teams in the nation today.
Nevertheless, the Yeomen will be
fighting hard to regain their lost

stature. As Coach Buck Leslie says: |

“Don’t look back and don’t look for-
ward.” Both teams go into the game
with the score board reading 0-0;
it’s the team that hits and plays the
hardest that makes the points. All
week long Coach Mac has been
warning his team that an opponent
can bounce back from a loss to the
point of completely overridding its
adversary.

The Oberlin team is a veteran
team. They have twenty-four re-
turning lettermen, including ten of
last year’s starters. They play ball
in a very rugged Ohio Valley Con-

ference and the experience that its|

twenty-four returnees boast is for-
midable. Although the Yeomen only

Sports Experts: Tax Your Cranium| W&L Generals Set To Go

jured in last wek’s game with Ran-
dolph-Macon, the squad is ready to
go. Sylvester and Flournoy will most
likely be ready also and have been
working out with their regular units
all week. Both had outstanding per-
formances against the Yellow Jack-
ets, and will be a great aid to the
Generals on Saturday.

All three units of the W&L team
are “up” for this game and are most
anxious to show the newcomers from
the Ohio Valley what kind of foot-
ball Virginians can play. As tackle
Jack Kelly puts it: “I can’t wait
to get my hands on one of ‘dem
guys’.” This is the general spirit of
the team. Not that they want to
physically maim Oberlin, they just
want to show them who is boss.

The General’s offense has picked
up more steam in practice and will
be hard to contain. It will be inter-
esting to compare this week’s Gen-
erals to the same team last week.
This statement is to mollify all indi-
viduals that the team’s defense was
sadly lacking against Randolph-
Macon.

The ‘13’ Club Renews Tradition
By Initiating 13 New Members

By WARREN MONTGOMERY

Every morning at the stroke of
9:20, 10:15, 11:10, and 12:05, the stu-
dent going to a class on the colon-
nade can see thirteen juniors in a
quasi-grovel position chanting some-
thing like “12345678910 misterames

crockard...” until all the older
members of the Thirteen Club are
named forwards and backwards and
a Cape Canaveral type countdown is
dispensed with. Besides the almost

odically crop up to show the rest of
us Plebians how ignorant and out-
of-it we are.

mative nature of this article. What
we do know is this: The aforesaid

Over Eighty To Be Present
To Promote Mutual Respect

By ROGER PAINE
Editor-in-Chief
Leaders from all campus organizations have been
invitations to the first Washington and Lee University Leader-
ship Conference. It will be held tomorrow evening, Wednes-
day, October 9, in the private dining room of Evans Hall.

issued

OPENINGS T0

Omicron Delta Kappa, national lead-*
ership fraternity, is sponsoring the
banquet.

Donald H. Partington, senior law
student and president of ODK, has
engineered the conference and ban-
quet. The original idea is attributed
to Prof. Rupert N. Latture, who sug-
gested that such a conference might
be beneficial to all campus organiza-
tions.

Over sixty student leaders and al-
most twenty faculty members, in-
cluding all active members of ODK,

will be present tomorrow. Mem-
bers of the Executive Committee,

fraternity presidents, the president
of the Interfraternity Council, a rep-
resentative from each varsity team,
Ring-tum Phi editors, and the lead-
ers of all other campus organiza-
tions are expected to attend.

Generate Mutual Respect

According to Partington, one pur-
pose of the meeting is “to generate a
mutual respect among the various
organizations, one for the other, so
each can have a better understand-
ing of each other’s role in W&L life.
Also, this can perhaps be a group
capable of handling problems not
within the realm of the Executive
Committee.

Partington plans to explore with
the group what possibilities there
are for such an organization to make
a solid contribution to the meshing
of campus leadership problems. If aj;
positive opinion of the merit of the |
gathering is formed, committees may |
be selected to pursue the most pres-
sing of the problems presented by |
the group as a whole .

 

Noell to Speak

At the banquet, Partington will |
make some introductory remarks as
will President Fred C. Cole. Bill|
Noell, president of the student body, |
will give a short address, after
which questions will be thrown to
the group. Ideally, such a group
would help coordinate student ac-
tivities, generate espirit de corps
among campus organizations, and
thereby eliminate some campus
apathy, according to Partington.

Openings in
Of ‘Collegian’
Might Be Late

By KEN McGRAW

As happens every year, October
finds a relatively small group of
students working in obscurity to

bring out Washington and Lee’s fav-
orite son and only humor magazine,
the Southern Collegian, in time for
its traditional debut on the week-
end of Openings Dances.

Editor Tain Tompkins has met his
deadline, but the perennial problem
of the cover advertisement threatens
to delay release of the magazine for
the third year in a row. The large,
four-color ad on the cover back is
printed outside the state, and in the
past, has proved susceptible to trans-
portation and production disturb-
ances.

“Will Not Disappoint”

Tompkins commented briefly on
the contents of this year’s initial
offering. Born out of post rush-
week confusion, the first issue last
year reflected the hate with which
it was assembled. Again this year,
time has not permitted all the
changes in policy and format that are
desired, but Tompkins guardedly
purports an issue that will “not dis-
appoint upperclassmen” who appre-
ciate writing which combines two
levels—the incisive and the prepos-
terous.

The editors generally agree that
the Collegian will remain in its nor-
mal ridiculous character, but may
invoke mild controversy, at least in
its initial appearance, which they
suggest will be “healthy in the ex-
treme, diverting, and in utmost good
humor.”

————— Te Crear

president of the Dance
Board, predicts that this concert
will not only present fine entertain-
ment but “something for the taste of
everyone.”

A number of releases in the last
few years have kept Roy Hamilton’s
name at the top of popularity lists.
Among these are: Don’t Let Me Go,
I Believe, Hurt, Ebe Tide, and If I
Loved You.

Hamilton offers Versatility

Versatility is one of Roy Hamil-
ton’s principal claims to fame. Many
attribute to this the fact that Ham-
ilton’s rise to popularity has been so
fast. In less than a decade he has
risen from a soloist in a church
choir to one of the top-rated popu-
lar singers in the country.

Besides his versatile voice, many
people are drawn to Hamilton by
the “sincerity and warmth” they
find in his voice. This quality in
Hamilton’s singing seems to have
made his spiritual songs and love
songs especially popular.

His first big hit was You'll Never
Love Again from Rodgers and Ham-
merstein’s Carousel. He gave the
song a fresh approach and his ren-
dition proved immediately success-
ful. This ability to give a song a
second popularity through a new
rendition has become a hallmark of
Hamilton .

Born in Virginia

Roy was born in Leesburg, Virgi-
nia, in 1929. His family soon moved
to Jersey City, New Jersey, where
he began singing in his church’s
choir at the age of six. In high
school Roy studied commercial art
and afterwards took up some ama-
teur boxing, but he never lost his
interest in singing.

Break Into Records

Hamilton began making occasional
appearances at night clubs as a
singer. At one of these appearances
he was heard by disc-jockey Bill
Cook. Cook reported him to Epic
Records and a contract was soon
signed. After his initial success with

Liberals Of W&L, Unite!

A new milestone was sunk into Washington and Lee’s
political turf last month with the publication of The South-
ern Conservative. With its second year in print this non-
profit newspaper has become progressively distinguished in
its format and in the quality of the writing it boasts.

The strongest point of The Southern Conservative. not-
withstanding its make-up and variety of articles, is the fact
that its editor, William Braithwaite, and those who assist
him, are very well-informed about the political philosophy
which they espouse. So informed, indeed, that they can pub-
lish both sides of many of the issues which they feel should
be brought to general attention.

Although we can say nothing but words of praise for the
integrity of this publication, we must recognize the fact that
the newspaper’s title correctly identifies its political inclina-
tions. The excellent job which conservative students on
campus are doing to promote their way of thinking brings
into bold relief the need for a similar organization of stu-
dents whose beliefs differ from those of the conservative

camp.

In light of the mock convention coming up next year,
it is important for as many students as possible to be familiar
with both sides of important political issues. We would like
to see the liberal students form a group, as they started to
last year, which could offer the student body an opportunity
to hear liberal speakers and to read about views held by

intelligent liberal politicians.

 

Pete Alford at the Sorbonne

 

W &L Senior Writes

(Editor’s Note: Pete Alford, a
W&L senior studying at the Sor-
bonne in Paris, wrote the follow-
ing letter to his parents shortly
after he arrived over there. The
letter contains Alford’s first im-
pressions of Paris and student life
there.)

Paris is first of all a crowded
area with almost 3 million people
living in an area 12 by 9 kilome-
ters. (Kilometer=6/10 mile.) The
grand Paris has 7 million inhab-
itants. I live on a small street
which is one block from the
Champs Elysees and just 4 blocks
from the Pardin de Tullieres.

If I walk in the other direction,
5 blocks, I am at the Are de
Triomphe and after I faire le tour
(or walk around the arc) I am at
Rue Victor Hugo. Two streets on
that is rue du Dome and the In-
stitute for European Studies. So
every morning I walk to class—If
I have time I walk up the Champs
or if I am pressed I go a quicker
way up rue Honore (named after
Balzac).

These first 2 weeks my day has
begun with cafe au lait, long
French bread, jelly and butter for
breakfast at Mme’s then to the
Institute for language lab at 8:30
and the second week at 9 (times
for this change every week) for
each student. At 10 I have a con-
versation class with Mr. Fonte-
villes for one hour. We prepare
each day 2 or 3 topics, not too in-
volved, and just talk about them.
The 45 students are divided into

A & B groups, according to abil-
ity, and I am in group A with
about 24 other students. At 11
am. we have a grammar course
which includes a dictee (dicta-
tion) every day.

My errors have become fewer,
but not to the level I will need to
pass this exam to take courses
there because the education sys-
tem is different in France. College
(French word) is equivalent to
our first 3 years of college in the

 

States. I may get around this be-
cause unlike the others at the
Institute I have had 3 years of
college.

At 12:30 we have lunch and af-
ter that I go across the street for
a cup of coffee and a little con-
versation with the proprietor of
the cafe across from the Institute.
There are few French students in
Paris now because the school
year doesn’t commence until No-
vember.

We have class for 2 hours each
afterhoon and 3 days a week de-
liver prepared 5 minute speeches
and the other 2 we correct with a
professor our written themes—we
write a theme of 1000 words a

  
  

week based on the lectures we at-
tend at the American Center.
These are held each weekday from
5:30-7:30 p.m. Then we have din-
ner at the Center. And then home
to study. There are also 2 hours
about, in the afternoon, to study.

My French family consists only
of Mme. Moanock. She has had
students before and speaks to us
often and helps us. We have one
bedroom with 2 beds, a room to
study which is really the dining
room and (she is very proud of
this)—trois Chambre d’eau (or
three rooms of water). That means
one room with a shower (twice a
week), one room with the toilet
and one with the sink. Each morn-
ing we have a thermos of hot
water to shave with. She has a
place in the country and goes there
every weekend. She has a TV and
is going to bring it back to Paris
soon,

Problems Beset

Dance Board

By ED CROFT ;

Dance Board President

The 1963-64 Dance Board in-
tends to bring variety to the cam-
pus social functions. Such artists
as Roy Hamilton, Stan Rubin,
Lloyd Price, Dakota Staton and a
sensational folk singing group
(to be announced later) will be
among the entertainers to appear
at Washington and Lee for Open-
ings and Fancy Dress. A change
in the Fancy dress schedule pro-
vides Saturday night free for fra-
ternity combos, as the concert
will be held in the afternoon.

Attempting to provide what the
students want in accordance with
what they can afford, the Dance
Board hopes that with the in-
crease in the price of the Dance
Plans along with a large partici-
pation in this program to be able
to bring to the campus the high-
powered entertainment which in
the past has been out of its price
range.

An item that has aroused con-
siderable criticism is the Dance
Board’s decision to increase the
price of the Dance Plan by $5.00.
The Dance Board is an organiza-
tion of the student body working
with its best interests in mind.
Anything that is undertaken is
voted on by the class and campus
leaders with the sole purpose of
providing the best entertainment
possible at a price which the stu-
dents can afford. This 1/5 increase
in price is necessary, since for the

Salinger’s Newest Stories

Called ‘Parts

By BERT PHILLIPS

“...and for a little reptile of a
critic to presume to find fault
with any of its parts, without
knowing the manner in which the

We Were Wondering...

Why the walks around the new science building
and duPont Hall were laid with right-angle corners,
when no students are known to walk that way.

I have seen two French movies
(1) Un Drole De Paroissien which
was about a man who made a liv-
ing stealing from the alms boxes
found in the churches in Paris and
(2) Germinal, which you know was
a novel by Zola about mine work-
ers in the 1860's.

The group of students at the In-
stitude is a good one but of a
makeup tht has not been familiar
to me. Ninety per cent are Catho-
lics and Democrats and though
there are a few Protestants and
Republicans I am the only one
one who is both an Episcopalian
and Republican. It should be in-
teresting for me—I was getting a
little too set in my way with the

   
 
      

LDCR

same surroundings at W&L and
in Syracuse and this certainly is a
change.

In the morning I read Le Fig-
ero—a paper of the mileu (“the
people”), but yet informative. At
night I read Le Monde which cor-..
responds to the N. Y. Times. To-
day, for example, I read in Le
Monde an article by Maurice Du-
vergen, a great French political
scientists. Some one whom I read in
Pol. Sci. at W&L. (Translated of
course).

Life here is not cheap and dur-
ing the first couple of months
there are a good many purchases
that have to be made. I really
need some clothes so I can look
like a starving student, but so far
I have only bought a sort of brief
case for books for 10 franes. If
you buy with travelers checks
you get a 20 per cent discount in
the large department store such as

I haven’t seen all of Paris yet
but I have been to the Eiffel
Tower, Jardin Puilleiers and Lux-
embough, down the Seine in a
tourist boat to L ’ile de la cite’ and
Notre Dame. Tomorrow, Sunday,
I am going to Bois Vincennes
which is the largest zoo in Paris.
Paris has 100,000 students, a third
of which are foreigners. In two
weeks I will receive a pass which
will allow me a 50 per cent reduc-
tion on all transportation.... The
subway (Metro) will be about 4c.
All the students joined the Jeunes
Musicales Francaise which gives
us a 30 to 50 per cent discount at
a number of concerts, movies,
plays, shows at the Comedien
Francaise, etc. Also, when the
school year starts we can get meals
at any of 5 student resturants on
weekends for 1 franc, 20 centimes
or about 25¢ which is bon
marche . . . . cheap!!!

One article of clothing which all
students wear is a sort of jacket
made of leather or suede. I under-
stand they cost about 60 francs
(15 dollars) and | plan to get one.
Jim Phyfe, a Kent classmate, is
working at the Morgan Bank
and I plan to see him during the
year. He lives on the left bank.
Went to a concert the other
night... it was the first of the
JMF series and was free to stu-
dents.

There is a history of art course
given every Sunday morning at
9 am. at the Louvre. I plan to
take it. It cost about 5 centimes a
week, (100 centimes per france, 5
franes per dollar). Right now the
intensive French we are taking
is wearing all of us out. But as we
have been told and I know it to be
true...it is very important so
that we are prepared to take sub-
jects in French at a French Col-
lege... when their classes start in
November.

Of An Epic’

presumptious absurdity.”

—Henry Fielding, Tom Jones
In 1962 two stories appeared in
hardback editions: “Raise High the
Roofbeam, Carpenters” and “Sey-
mour, An Introduction,” which
J. D. Salinger had previously writ-
ten for the New Yorker. If one
were to read this book without any
previous knowledge of Salinger’s
writing, he would no doubt be
confused; however, these two rath-
er long, short stories should not
be considered as separate entities,
but rather as parts of an epic
which begins with Holden Cau-
field (The Catcher in the Rye) and
continues through all the other
stories which Salinger has writ-
ten. It is a story which is con-
cerned with what is perhaps the
grandest theme of literature: the
relationship of man to God, or lack
of God.

Bride at Atlar

“Raise High the Roofbeam, Car-
penters’” main scene takes place
during a traffic jam in a taxicab in
which Seymour Glass is discussed
by several guests who were to
have witnessed his wedding, but
which he had been “too happy” to
attend. Among these guests is
his brother Buddy, with whom
Salinger chooses to associate him-
self. The story concludes with
Buddy reading sections from Sey-
mour’s diary which is designed to
explain why he leaves his bride at
the altar, and to suggest why he
kills himself after his marriage.
Without “Raise High the Roof-
beam, Carpenters” the suicide
which ends “A Perfect Day for
Bananafish” appears motivated
chiefly by Seymour’s inability to
put up with Holden Caulfield
constantly referred to as_ the
“phoneyness” of bourgeois socie-
ty.”

To explain Seymour's suicide we
must first be acquainted with
the death of Salinger’s ten-year-
old Buddha, “Teddy.” Teddy is a
true Eastern mystic who sees log-
ic as “the apple eaten in the Gar-
den of Eden and the beginning of
man’s concern with material life
and separation from real, spirit-
ual life.” Teddy is granted through
mystic revelation the experience
for which Seymour longs. In
Teddy’s case, he withdraws him-
self from society in order to be
better able to experience union
with God, and perhaps Seymour’s
self-inflicted death could be view-
ed as a similar case. But it appears

:Coun Syuire

By A. L. BROCKENBROUGH
Wednesday, October 2
While grabbing a cup of coffee
in the Co-op this morning, I talked
to several students about the
Dance Plans. Some had _ bought
them, while others hadn’t and said
they didn’t plan to. I asked the
latter what their objections were.
Some thought the quality of the
entertainment was poor in compar-
ison to past years, and generally
out of keeping with the recent
trends in student taste. Others saw
no justification for the raise in
price. I wonder which of these
reasons caused the drop in sales.

Thursday, October 3

I talked to my freshman friend
today, Mike Newman. He was a
little bewildered by the dating sit-
uation here, having had a date
with a Hollins freshman this past
weekend. It seems she was as-
tounded, not to say scared to
death, by all the wild parties. I
asked Mike if he had done any-
thing to frighten her, and he said
no; he had passed out at ten, but
only for an hour or so.

Friday, October 4

One of my classes was so boring
today I fell asleep. I really didn’t
miss anything, though; the lec-
turer’s monotone was devoted to
reiterating the same stuff we had
read in the textbook the night be-
fore.

Saturday, October 5

I went around to a few of the
combo parties tonight and noticed
that while the twist had gone out
of style, nothing has risen to take
its place. In the past we have had
the “U.T.” and, I have heard, the

“P.U.”; why not a new dance
called the “W&L?”

Sunday, October 6

I didn’t get out of bed today
until after lunch, just in time to

I am beginning to be suspicious
of people with hangovers. Many
of the worst cases just weren't
that loaded the night before. I
think it has something to do with
conservation; either the person
afflicted needs a topic to talk
about, so he manufactures one,
or he doesn’t want to talk at all,
this being a convenient excuse.
But I really shouldn’t point fingers
today.

School Spirit Applauded

Dear Sir,

On behalf of the Varsity Club
I would like to congratulate the
members of the student body who
responded so actively Saturday
to our program aimed at increas-
ing spirit at W&L athletic con-
tests. It shows that the apathy
with regard to cheering at W&L
games, which has been the rule
rather than the exception in past
years, can be overcome. I believe
the spectators enjoyed the game
more when they cheered, and I
know personally many of the
players on the field Saturday re-
ceived encouragement which they
have not known since high school
days .

I especially want to thank the
cheerleaders from Southern Semi-
nary and the Volunteers from
W&L who did such an outstanding
ing job in arousing spectator en-
thusiasm. The girls, who respond-
ed so ably to our plea of assist-

\3

 

ance, will be back for the re-
mainder of the home football
games and the _ entire home

Generals’ Gridmen Sharp In Rout Of Oberlin

Jackets Fall, 6-1,
To W&L Soccer
Men; Henry Ace

By TOM CARPENTER
Tuesday Sports Writer

After a slow start the Washington
and Lee soccer team scored three
goals in the third period and two
in the fourth to trounce Randolph-
Macon, 6-1, here Friday.

The Generals scored the only goal
of the first half in the initial stanza
when Tim Henry got his first of two
goals. After that both goalies were
invincible for the remainder of the
period.

Late in the second quarter the vis-
itors’ goalie was injured and was
removed from the game. This was
the turning point of the game.

Decisive 3rd Quarter

The third quarter was decisive
as W&L wasted little time in ac-
quainting the new Macon goalie to
the excellence of the front line.
Henry picked up his second goal
to give the winners a 2-0 advantage.
Charlie Sweet followed Henry’s ex-
ample by scoring, although he did
it without the advantage of his feet.
Sweet knocked in the third goal with
his head.

Macon got its lone goal shortly
after Sweet scored. Jim Mell got it
back for the Generals in the same
period when he scored while trying
to pass to Steve Hibbard. Mell's pass
went “astray” and dropped into the
upper right hand corner of the net.

The Generals added two more in-
surance goals in the fourth period
on shots by Hibbard and Preben
Berthelsen. Hibbard scored his in
the same fashion as Sweet with a
nice set-up pass by Henry.

Green Outstanding

Tom Green had is usual outstand-
ing game at goalie, making numer-
ous saves, but the phase of play by
Green that drew the most comment
from his teammates was his goal
kicking. For the layman goal kick-
ing is what the goalie does with
the ball after making a save. He
kicks the ball down field as far as he
can to give the offense a chance
to have the ball as close to the op-
ponents goal as possible. One of
Green’s teammates said that he
thought Green’s kicks were going
almost three-fourths of the field.

Other stars of the game were
Bruce Jackson, who played his usu-
al fine game, and Howard Bussey.
Bussey, who was converted from
wing to fullback this year by Coach
Lyles, has adapted to his new posi-
tion very well.

The most improved player in this
game was Pete Preston. Preston,
who plays fullback, has improved his
kicking immensely.

The black note of the game was the
injury to Dave Redmond in the third
quarter. Redmond received a dis-
located jaw while fighting for a
bouncing ball.

The freshmen team appears to be
coming along nicely. The Little Gen-
erals dropped a tough 2-1 decision
to a good Lynchburg squad Thurs-

 

day at Lynchburg.

Staunton Military Academy on Wilson Field.

The great depth of the General’s representatives again paid off in vic-

 

return of a sideline pass accounted*
for the only scoring of the game.

The Baby Generals farthest drive
came in the first series of downs
when Quarterback Bryant Kendrick
and Halfback John Bogart moved the
ball from their own 35 to the SMA
20 only to have an offsides penalty
and a dropped pass kill the march.

Defensively, Bill Sledge, Bill Gam-
bill, Charlie Myers, Logan Bullitt,
and Bob Reading held the SMA run-
ning attack in check, and were in
the SMA backfield or throwing the
quarterback for a loss, most of the
game.

Offensively guards Roger Milam,
Skip Brooks, and Steve McElhaney
sprung Bogart open a number of
times.

Coach Swan sums up the game:
“The boys came to play this week.
It was 100 per cent improvement
over last week’s game, and it showed
us and them what they are capable
of. We lost on our own mistakes:
an interception, and a long run re-
sulting from a fumble cost us the
game.

“Our defense played an outstand -
ing game, however we still need of-
fensive punch—next week we'll have
both.”

The Baby General’s next game
is on Wilson Field Friday, Oct. 18
against Augusta Military. “AMA
uses U. S. C. coach McRay’s shift-
ing-I and it should be a wide open
game,” concluded Swan.

McDaniel’s Long
Passes, Defense
Earn 29-13 Win

By JIM CROTHERS
Assistant Sports Editor

Whereas last week, Washington
and Lee relied on outstanding per-
formances from several individuals,
it was a team effort Saturday that
powered the Generals over the visit-
ing Oberlin College, 29-13.

Strong defensive stands inside the
20-yard line, long passes from John
McDaniel to Buck Ogilvie, and
three alternating teams were too
much for the Ohio Yeomen as Wash-
ington and Lee scored 21 points in
the second half to win its second
game of the 1963 season and eighth
in a row.

Yeomen Strike First

Oberlin surprised the Generals in
the second quarter by drawing first
blood with a 7 yard pass from Jim
Wright to fullback, John McCaslin.
W&L, however, came right back and
seored on fullback Syd Butler’s
two yard plunge four plays after
Ogilvie had blocked a Yeoman punt
on the Ohioan’s own 1l-yard line.
Henry Sackett added the two point
conversion with an end run to put
Washington and Lee ahead to stay,
8-7.

Sackett ran Oberlin’s second-half
kickoff back 35 yards to the W&L
45-yard line where Butler and soph-
omore Harry Brookby continued the
drive with several powerful end-
sweeps to the Yeoman 26. McDaniel
then lofted his first of two scoring
passes to Ogilvie, and Brookby ran
the conversion for his first two W&L
points.

Yoffe Adds Clincher

Needing only eight plays the next
time the Generals got the ball, they
marched 54 yards and potential Lit-
tle All-American Stu Yoffe added

’| his third touchdown of the season to

hike the score to 23-7.

After holding Oberlin on the
W&lI 15-yard line with a fine de-
fensive effort early in the fourth
quarter, Washington and _ Lee
mounted its final scoring drive.
Yoffe’s 18-yard end-sweep, two long
gains by Sacket, and a fullback draw

’| by Butler good for 15 yards high-

lighted the General march to the
Yoeman 15-yard line. Another Mc-
Daniel-Ogilvie pass completed the
W&L scoring and upped the score to

Croft Urges Support For Dances

(Continued from page 2)

past ten years the price of the
Dance Plan has remained stable
while the cost of big-named enter-
tainment has increased consider-
erably. Five years ago Hamilton
cost $1500; now he demands and
gets $2500, an increase of 2/5.
This rise in the cost is exemplary

highly unsympathetic to a situa-
tion beyond the oroganization’s
control.

Although there are legal means
of extracting retribution for such
breaches of contract, pecuniary
compensation does not repair the
damage already done to the week-
end. Money that would have gone
to these entertainers is returned

 

of that throughout the entertain-
ment field and is the necessary
justification for the 1/5 increase in
the Dance Plan price.

to the Dance Board fund to pay
for the rest of the year’s enter-
tainment.

This new school year heralds
an inevitable change. Because of
the drop-off sales this year, it
seems that perhaps the reason is
the price increase. Gentlemen,
look not to the past. The Dance
Board can operate successfully
with your continued interest and
support. Let's see some school
spirit applied to your Dance Board.
I ask you to reconsider the offer
of a $30 Dance Plan in the light
of the intentions of the current
Dance Board. Dance Plans will
be on sale again this week.

seems not so much to bring to these
songs new stylings or highly per-
sonalized arrangements, as to be
singing them for the first time.”
The albums put out by the young
singer attest to the variety of sub-
ject matter his voice is capable of
treating: “With All My Love,” “Mr.
Rock and Soul,” “Have Blues Must

albums he sings both old favorites
and new songs. His greatest success
seems to have been with the old
favorites.

considered as too much verbal
ado about not quite enough. But
Salinger gives answers to the
problems which Holden Caufield
first struggles with in The Catch-
er in the Rye. In Seymour’s and
Teddy’s case, a reader searching
for his own “answer” will most
likely be disappointed. We don’t
have too many Buddhas-to-be in
our Western society, but as I have
stated, Salinger does give a more
“practical” answer to those search-
ing for meaning in an earlier book,
Franny and Zooey. Salinger speaks
for all those who have not hope—
or at least interest—in the search
for love and union with God in the
present-day world. Surely there
is a need for such a search in any

U.P. NAMES FRESHMAN E.C. CANDIDATE

 

Leadership Group Confers,
Plans Formal Organization

How can we instill a campus esprit de corps’ Can we ef.-

fectively revive our traditions?

These were two basic questions which were treated at
the first Washington and Lee University Leadership Confer-
ence. It was held Wednesday night in the Evans private dining
hall, under the sponsorship of the national leadership frater-

nity, Omicron Delta Kappa.

Before an assembly of some six-
ty student leaders and twenty fac-
ulty members, ODK president Don
Partington stated in his introduc-
tory remarks that the purpose of
the new body was to “create mutual
respect among the student organiza-
tions” and provide a way for stu-
dent leaders to “discuss and share
mutual goals.”

Noell Speaks

In a five-minute address, student
body president Bill Noell stressed
the significance of W&L’s leaders
working as “an integrated whole.”
Noell divided his talk into the
“W&L spirit,” the “W&L man,” and
the “W&L leader.”

In his talk, Noell commented on
the discrepancy between what the
freshman is told about Washington
and Lee and what he sees. Noell re-
marked that the leaders of W&L
are confronted with the challenge
to breach this gap between the real
and ideal, to create an “atmosphere
conducive to the development and
communication” in the University.

Noell’s address was followed by
comments from the floor in which
the possibilities for the organization
were discussed and analyzed. It was
concluded that the newly formed
group would first provide a way for
student organizations to work to-
gether and, secondly, act as an outlet
for student feelings.

Officers Elected

During the conference, Jud Reis,
Phi Psi senior, was elected presi-
den ;Bill Burke, Beta freshman law
student, vice-president.

A steering committee is being se-
lected to help coordinate the new
organization under common objec-
tives. Students and faculty mem-
bers interested in contributing ideas
about the posible services of this
organization are encouraged to send
them in to the W&L Student Leader-
ship Organization, care of the Execu-
tive Committee.

The selections to the steering
committee will be announced next
week.

The purpose of the Wednesday’s
conference, according to Partington,
was to raise problems and questions
dealing with campus activities.

Rededication of Chapel
Highlights Homecomings

Alumni returning for Washing-
ton and Lee University’s annual
Homecoming tomorrow will be treat-
ed to special guided tours of the
newly-restored Lee Chapel.

Coffee will be served in the
Chapel’s Lee Museum from 10:30
a.m. until 11:45 a.m., but tours for
alumni and wives will begin at 10
a.m.

Although the Chapel reopened its
doors to the public in August, Sat-
urday’s open house will show for the
first time new display cases in the
Lee Museum which were especially
designed to accommodate the hun-
dreds of items of Lee memorabilia.

The custom built cases arrived and |

were installed earlier this week.

Other items on the Homecoming
program include a_faculty-alumni

luncheon in Evans Dining Hall at! the Young Republicans to a public
noon, and the = p.m. football game | i Young Democrat President

on Wilson Field between the un-
beaten Washington and Lee Gener-
Colonels from Contre
College of Kentucky. A Homecom-
ing queen will be crowned at half-
time.

After the game, alumni
vited back to Evans Hall for coffee,
sandwiches, and an opportunity to
meet Coach Lee McLaughlin, other
members of his staff, and the Wash-
ington and Lee football squad.

Missing from the Homecoming

program this year is the competition |

among Washington and Lee fraterni-
ties for the most appropriately dec-
orated fraternity house. The Uni-
versity’s alumni-faculty committee

Washington and Lee’s new Young
Democrats club met for the first
time Tuesday night and challenged

Eckes issued the challenge and
- asked the Forensic Union to
sponsor the debate.

The Young Democrats, who organ-

year, were 21 strong at the opening
meeting which was held in the
Student Union. Dr. Milton Colvin
was present at the meeting and spoke
briefly to the group.

The projected debate is intended
to introduce a new spirit to the
campus, which up until now has
allowed the Young Republicans a!
monopoly on political life. It would
also arouse interest in the approach-
ing 1964 elections.

SWMSFC Elects
Eleven Students
To Membership

Eleven W&L men are to become
new members of the Student War
Memorial Scholarship Fund Com-
mittee.

Among those
juniors; Joe Bear,
Carrell, SAE;
Phi Kap.

Sophomores Chosen

Sophomore George Bokinsky, Phi
Kap SAE sophomore Charles Giffin,
and Phi Delt sophomore Birnie Har-
per were also selected.

Five more sophomores complete
the list, with ZBT contributing two—
Steve Sweitzer and Charles Walker.
Neely Young represents Sigma Chi;
Rick Richmond, Beta, and David
Marchese, Phi Gam.

SWMSFC picked these students
after it organizational meeting Mon-
day night. Scholastic, and extra-
curricular qualifications and their
money-making suggestions served as
criteria in making the choices.

$3,000 Given

The purpose of the organization
is to raise funds for scholarships.
Last year the group presented
$3,000 to the university to be used
for scholarships. This represented
three years’ work.

President Randy Wootton has said
that he hopes the group will be
able to present another $3,00 to
W&L in two years.

Program Revamped

To accomplish this goal SWMSFC
has revamped its money program.
This year a series of 10 money
raising projects will be undertaken.
Each project will be headed by a
definite chairman.

Among the projects are selling
rings, Christmas cards stationery,
concessions and graduation invita-
tions, a clothes raffle and a spring
concert.

. Greenville, South Carolina, served as President of the Student
* Body and as President of the School

Executive Committee. Kendricks
gained experience for the offices by
serving as Treasurer and Secretary
of the student body in his sophomore
and junior years, respectively.

Academically, Kendrick has also
excelled, being an honor roll student
for four years in high school which
resulted to his election to the Na-
tional Honor Society in his junior
year—an honor usually reserved for
seniors.

Kendrick combined his leadership
and scholarship talents with ath-
letics, serving as captain of the
school track and football teams.
Furthermore, he holds a Carnegie
Medal for lifesavings.

As a freshman at Washington and
Lee, Kendricks has containued to
participate in school affairs as tri-
captain of the freshman football
team, a member of the University
Christian Association, and an officer
in his fraternity pledge class.

Elections for this office between
Kendricks and an unannounced Pri-
gressive Candidate will be held Mon-
day, October 21, 1963. In recent years
the freshmen voting have stuck in
general to party lines; however the
reallignment of parties last year
bringing the relative strength closer
and with the uncertain consequences
of a greater independent vote, it
will be excedingly difficult to pre-
dict the outcome of this year’s elec-
tion.

UP chairman Al Eckes issued the
following statement:

“The most important functions
of a Washington and Lee political
party is to nominate outstanding
candidates who will represent the
entire student body. Too often other
campus parties have selected their
candidates so that selected frater-
nities maintain their “gravy-train”
monopoly of campus offices. W&L
has seen many candidates chosen
with few qualifications.

“The University Party condemns
such behavior and urges the other
campus political party to nominate
a candidate with demonstrated ex-
perience and ability this year.

“Bryant Kendrick was selected to
represent the University Party on
the basis of his outstanding high
school record, his achievement on
the Washington and Lee campus,
and his honest desire to represent
all freshmen as a member of the
Executive Committee. He is, with-
out a doubt, the best-qualified fresh-
man to run for this important post
in recent years.

“I urge all freshmen—fraternity
and nonfraternity students—to meet
Bryant, to examine his qualifications,
and to compare him with the nom-
inee of the Progressive Party bosses.”

The Chapel was built under the |

he was president of the College |

and was originally dedicated on June

18, 1868 in a simple ceremony in
connection with commencement of |
that year.

Today’s ceremony was preceded by

a program of organ music presented

by Dr. James G. Leyburn, pro-
fessor of sociology. The program was
presented on the Chapel’s Eben

the Chapel in 1872 and was rebuilt

Speaking of Lee Chapel as a

said, in part, “There are many sta-
tues, many memorials and _ tributes
to Robert E. Lee throughout our
country, but I know I speak for all
Lee descendants when I say that
this Chapel the most honored
memory of all.”

He added, “

“on behalf of the Lee family and
all others who cherish the memory
of Robert E. Lee,” to the Ford Motor

Company Fund who financed the
restoration of the Chapel, and to
the University.

His talk was followed by remarks
from Benson Ford, president of the
|Ford Motor Company Fund. He
stated that this was the first time

that the fund has allocated money
for a project of historical restoration.
He said that the decision was made
“in the spirit of my grandfather who
believed strongly in the value
reconstructing and preserving out-
standing examples of our national
past an inspiration and _ lesson
for our future.”

He closed his speech
following: “As consecrated

this Chapel can, we believe, cement
a new and necessary understanding

He also expressed his gratitude,| among all parts of our nation.

|rededicated Lee Chapel.

 

By dramatizing the selfless ded-
ication of Robert E. Lee to the prin-
ciples of honor, human dignity,
learning and “the thorough educa-
tion of all classes of the people,” this
Chapel can be become a symbol of
the fundamental values that unite
us all.

“Tt will truly enshrine the mem-
ory of Robert E. Lee. Then perhaps
in years to come, people, in think-
ing of him, will not say he led an
army in service of half of a nation.
Instead, they will say he led a
school in service of all mankind.”

The talks were concluded with
a brief speech by President Cole on
behalf of the University. The W&L
Glee Club then sang “With a Voice
of Singing” by Martin Shaw and
the benediction was delivered by
the Rey. Dr. John Newton Thomas
of Richmond, a member of the Board
of Trustees. The program was closed
by the singing of “College Friend-
ships” by the Glee Club.

A Followup

Cheering at last Saturday’s football game showed a marked
improvement. Thanks to the Varsity Club, Southern Sem
cheerleaders, and a well-played game, the response from the
bleachers was a heart-warming change from the customary
deadness.

However, the spirit exhibited last week will mean absolutely
nothing unless it is perpetuated. Homecomings tomorrow af-
fords the ideal opportunity to make a successful follow-up of
a hopeful beginning—let’s give these alumni something to talk
about when they go back home!

An Asset To Student Needs?

The conference of campus leaders last Wednesday night
might very well launch a new epoch in student body activities.
If carried through successfully, the new organization should
provide a critical avenue for concerted action from within the
student body.

The organization penetrates every area of student affairs;
it represents a wide cross-section of campus viewpoints. We
consequently feel that one of the most promising possibilities
of such a group lies in its potentiality as an effective medium
for exploring student needs and affording them proper ex-
pression.

Numerous other, more concrete possibilities are equally
as promising. The organization is presently engaged in select-
ing a steering committee and drawing up some definite ob-
jectives. Members of the student body and the faculty who
have any suggestions or comments to offer, particularly on the
needs which such an organization might meet, are urged by
chairman Jud Reis to write them in. Suggestions should be
mailed to the W&L Student Leadership Organization, care of
The Executive Committee, Washington and Lee University.

 

Big-Name Entertainers

Washington and Lee has enjoyed a high degree of social
prestige among southern colleges. This status is attributed
largely to our annual four Dance Set Weekends, which have
presented such big-time entertainers as Louis Armstrong,
Count Basie, and Lionel Hampton.

With the idea of carrying on his high standard of enter-
tainment, Dance Board president Ed Croft has scheduled
an outstanding line-up for the coming season. In addition to
Hamilton and Price for Openings, Croft has confided to us
that a contract is under way for Ian and Sylvia for the Fancy
Dress Ball. He further revealed that he had tentatively con-
tracted Ray Charles and Chad Mitchell for Springs, and the
Smothers Brothers for Finals.

Croft remarked that these groups have not been officially
announced since they do not represent definite contracts.
However, he assured us that they were available and we can
get them depending on the student response to next week’s
Dance Plan sales.

So, if this is the entertainment that you, as students, want
for the coming year, the Dance Board will have to have your
support. They can get these groups with the student body be-
hind them.

Republicans Seek ‘Gimmick

a new tax plan. Ironically enough,
Goldwater once wrote “a little piece”
on how the Volstead Act and the
income tax amendment affected
American morals. This sounds

At present, the only active, well-

Rather than seeking a common
political ground with which to ef-

 

fectively oppose the Kennedy Ad-
ministration, Republicans seem to
want a new slant, a gimmick to
spring on the public. Recognizing
the Democrat’s success at selling the
package politics in the forms of the
New and Fair deals and the New
Frontier, a voiceful faction of the
Republican Party believes in push-
ing their reluctant messiah, Barry
Goldwater, and his brand of “Con-
servatism.”

Senator Goldwater has been al-
lowed to run around in the party
like a native witch doctor chanting
cures for the country’s ills and
has built up a vigorous following
of promoters and publicists. But
even he, as the possibility of fac-
ing a tough political contest rapid-
ly approaches, has been gradually
shifting his stand.

In his autobiography, Goldwater
wrote that he opposed a progressive
income tax in favor of a fixed rate
tax. To institute such a measure it
would be necessary to raise the
taxes of nine out of ten taxpayers.
In the face of the generally accepted
fact that a tax cut is needed to spur
economy, the Senator now says he
would modify his position and have

 

known force of political stability and
dynamic policy in the Republican
Party revolves around Governor
Rockefeller. New York State under
Rockefeller has been able to work
out problems which will appear as
national issuse in the Presidential
campaign. The state has brought
its fiscaly policy into balance and
has gone on a “Pay-as-you-go” ba-
sis. And as a direct result of this,
state aid to education has been in-
creased, 500 million in the last year
as over five years ago. Fundamental
civil rights laws prohibiting dis-
crimination in social and economic
areas now exist in New York sta-
tutes.

Obviously, as Governor Rockefeller
has said, debate within the party
ranks can serve as a creative for-
mat for platform programs and
awaken the public to basic issues.
But unfortunately, a party of split
interests will be very easily bowled
over by the Kennedy machine.

THE RING-TUM PHI

W&L Junior Relates His Experiences

In East African Summer

By DAVID COHN

The seriousness of the average
African is one of the chief differ-
ences that sets him apart from the
average American, according to a
W&L junior, who spent eleven
weeks in Kenya this summer.

As a representative of the Virginia
Baptist Student Union, Malcolm
Morris traveled throughout East
Africa working under the direction
of the Southern Baptist Foreign
Mission Board. While there he had
the opportunity to work both with
African students in high school and
with African Christians in small
Baptist churches.

In Mombasa, a coastal city, Mor-
ris worked in Mombasa Baptist High
School for six weeks, with thirty-
six ninth grade African students.
His job included conducting a Bible

Class as well as several extra-cur-

ricular activities.

“My job was to both teach and
learn. Through my teaching exper-
iences, I sought to gain a clear pic-
ture of the way of life in Kenya.
The most important part of my job
is trying to express now what needs
I experienced among the people of
East Africa.”

In addition to holding the six
days a week classes, the tasks of
organizing a debate group, a Baptist
student union, and a_ volleyball
team fell under his charge. Sunday
mornings were devoted to speaking
through interpreters at several
African churches, while the eve-
nings were spent speaking at the
English speaking churches in Mom-
basa.

“The Keyans that I met were quite

 

 

serious about every facet of their
lives. They were intensely loyal to
their religious beliefs whatever they
might be. They were extrmely proud
of their nation and intensely loyal to
their political parties and leaders.
To young and old alike education
was one of the most important things
in life.”

In the midst of this busy schedule,
Morris found time for hunting sa-
faris and roaming throughout the
ancient city of Mombasa and the
surrounding countryside.

In addition, political rallies were

Salaam Baptist Church in Tanganika.

an extra attraction. On one occa-
sion he heard Jomo Kenyatta, the
formerly imprisoned Mau Mau lead-
er who is to be Kenya’s first prime
minister following her December 12
independence from Britain.

At one point during the rally a
fierce verbal attack was made against
the press. Morris, toting a camera,
was mistaken for a journalist. Soon
a government official ordered him
to photograph a near roit that was
developing. Morris, in the midst of
twenty thousand Africans, had no
alternative but to obey.

 

Mottley Commends New Flicks
For Being “Truthful To Novels’

By BOB MOTTLEY

Three novels are making cine-
matic premiers in New York through
adaptations that are surprisingly
truthful to the original accounts:
Anton Chekhov's The Steppe (which
concerns a young boy’s journey
through 19th Century Russia) has
been compellingly filmed in Italy,
and stars Charles Vanel; Leo Tol-
stoi’s Resurrection is absorbing and
jarring in the hands of an all-Rus-
sian cast and director. His thesis
that a guilt-stricken prostitute may
become spiritually regenerated is
beautiful art, perhaps, but after re-
cent scandals in England, American
viewers are likely to misinterpret its
moral, having been conditioned by
the mass media to eat their Rice-
Davies with snap, crackle and pop
instead of piety. Henry Fielding’s
Tom Jones emerges on the screen
with vivid elan, sparked by a witty
British cast starring Albert Fin-
ney and Susannah York.

“Lord of the Flies”

On the other side of the coin,
two widely known books have not
been made into successful movies—

the British hideously bungled Gold-| ™

ing’s Lord of the Flies by milk-
sopping the author’s trenchant style,
and things are not going well with

The Bible, a composite assimilation] 4

of the Holy Word by certain Italian
directors that won’t win the Golden
Beanie for this or any other year.
I shudder to think of the end result
of this travesty of all cinematic
travesties—it would be apropos if
the Second Coming coincided with
its world premiere.

Locally, the Lyric will soon offer
Bergman’s The Seventh Seal, Jean
Genet’s The Balcony (which the
grande dames shouldn’t miss), and
Akira Kurosawa’s Rashamon; in
contrast, Bye, Bye, Birdie is pend-
ing at the State. (I prefer not to
think of this “musical,” as it repre-
sents the only time in my life when
I physically vomited in a theater,
not at Ann-Margret, but during the
apotheosis of Ed Sullivan.)

Prostitution of Talent

The VIP’s was conceived by
M-G-M to cash in while the mink
was warm on the chief stars of
Fox’s wretched Cleopatra, Terrence
Rattigan’s screenplay sets a new
high water sewarge mark for Holly-
wood: a group of the Very Affluent
go into a schizophrenic funk at the
London Airport when their jet is
grounded by a bloody fog. Cherfully
and capably leading the hand-
wringing are Margaret Rutherford
and Orson Welles (without a Mar-
tian in sight), while trailing far,
far behind are the two luminaries
for whom the whole slick package
was fondly prepared. Elizabeth Tay-
lor’s acting, so inferior to her other
capacity, is unusually threadbare
here; Richard Burton makes a pos-

 

itive ass of himself, which is at
least an improvement on his per-
formance in Cleopatra. Why in the
name of all that is Welsh and holy
does this great actor continue to
prostitute his abilities in fatuous
cinema productions? His diction
alone is the best we have had since
Peter Marshall’s (no other compar-
ison is implied); only Burton could
bring off with such shattering force a
line as trite as his reply to a query
about the location of a RAF buddy
in The Longest Day: “At the bot-
tom of the Channel.” This is—ap-
proximately—his own position in
dramatic circles, but it does not
have to be so.

 

Superiority on Stage
Burton has two peers in the legiti-
mate theater: Sir Laurence Oliver

and Sir John Gielgud; he has per-|

sonally contributed a definite Cor-
iolanus and a Hamlet that swept
the boards of the old Vic at a time
when Hamlets had to be box-office
or else. It is obvious in evrey one
of his films from The Robe to The
VIP’s that the camera cannot cap-
ture what mesmerizes the stage in a
Burton performance. Unlike Taylor,
one can willingly forgive him for
anything on the basis of his im-
mense talent, and it will be a happy
day at Stratford when this amazing,

P.E. classes are busy disspelling the
rumor of the soft American.

As any student knows, it is im-
possible to achieve any goals at
all in college, if he cannot do a
hundred pushups, thirty squat jumps
or run a mile without taking a
deep breath. Once again this year
though, only half the freshman class
is able to do these things. The
“weaker students” are presently
trying to perfect these vital skills,
for they realize that without these
necessities academic excellence
would be unattainable. The more
fortunate ones, however, are mean-
while playing organized fun and
games far away from the “dummies.”
It is not until the sophomore year
that the brains of the class are
allowed to mix with the lower ech-

perhaps the best food in Lexington
is served. A bit more American than
the Parisien C.I., it nevertheless has
an atmosphere all its own, and any
new or old students who have not
yet had a Swissburger should go in
and try one.

The Town Inn has acquired a
new pinball machine this year
with plenty of opportunity for
free games. Anyone in the vicinity
who would like to spend some
enjoyable moments, stop by the
Lawhorne’s and relax over a
brew at one of Lexington’s best

Adventure

From Mombasa Morris’s work sent
him to Dar-es-Salaam, Tanganika,
where for a week he conducted
evening services at Kinondoni
Baptist Church. Trips by plane, car,
and bus took him to the countries of
Zanzibar and Uganda, and to the
Victorian source of the Nile River
and to Lake Victoria.

At the end of the summer, Morris
joined a five-day safari climbing the
19,340 foot high Mt. Kilamanjaro in
Tanganyika, Africa’s highest peak.
In a party with six British residents
of the area and several African
porters, Morris and one other climb-
er were the only ones to survive
altitude sickness, and sub-zero
weather to finally reach the edge
of the crater rim that is the top.
However, the W&L student found
his moment of triumph briefly
tainted by an attack of altitude
sickness immediately upon reaching
the top.

Besides the wreath of flowers that
is the traditional reward for reach-
ing Kilamanjaro’s summit Morris
brought back “countless rewarding
memories, and friendships,” hun-
dreds of colored slides, and numer-
ous African carvings.

 

Jazz Program
Is Announced
For Sunday

On Sunday evening, October 13,
1963, the Westminister Fellowship
of the Lexington Presbyterian
Church will present a program on
“Jazz, Theology, and Authenticity,”
beginning at 7. Mr. Charles B. Cast-
ner will provide most of the jazz,
Mr. Douglas C. Chase will provide
most of the theology.

Mr. Castner graduated from Wash-
ington and Lee in 1952. During his
undergraduate days, Charlie helped
lead a six-piece, all-campus Dixie-
land jazz band, the W&L “Stomp-
ers.

Mr. Charles B. Castner

Mr. Castner now work in Louis-

ville for the Louisville-Nashville
Railroad. He recently organized an-
other Dixieland band composed of
business and professional men.

Coming from a musical family,
Charlie became interested in jazz
from a Negro hired man who work-
ed around the Castner residence.
Charlie bought his first jazz records
in 1939 and has been collecting rec-
ords, music and data on jazz ever
since.

Mr. Chase is the minister of the
Lexington Presbyterian Church. A
lifetime musician, he has played in
several bands before entering the
ministry and is an accomplished
pianist.

Supper is served at 6:15. The pro-
gram begins at 7:00.

W&L To Face Centre For Homecomings

W & L Generals To Meet |
Centre In First CAC Game

Centre College moves into Lex-
ington tomorrow to face Washing-
ton and Lee’s powerful Generals in
the local homecoming tilt. The game
to be played on Wilson Field at
2:00 p.m. will be the first CAC
conference game for coach Lee Mc-
Laughlin’s charges, who are shooting
for their 29th victory in their last
31 contests.

“Took for a surprise,” said coach

Mac as he summed up the Danville, | @

Kentucky, team. “They’re a hustling

ball club who mix their plays well||-

from a ‘Wing-T’ and ‘double wing’.”

“Their biggest threat will come
from the Jackson brothers. The
older of the two is a fine quarter-
back who started for the University
of Kentucky last season. His young-
er brother plays fullback and runs
well.”

Centre, 1-1 this season, beat con-

ference Southwestern last week 20-| |

8. According to coach Buck Leslie,
who scouted the game, Centre
showed “100 per cent improvement
over the week before when they
outplayed Maryville for three quar-
ters, but lost 20-7.”

The major problem facing coach
McLaughlin is his team’s inability
to score early in the game. In W&L’s
first game against Randolph-Macon,
the Generals had to score late in
the second half to put the game out
of reach. Last week they fell be-

     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

managed to win 29-13.

“No, we're not going to change
our attack much. We like to play
percentage ball. We'll adjust to their
defense.” Johnny McDaniel proved
last week that the Generals do have
an air game to go with the fine run-

hind 7-0 to Oberlin before they| ning of Stuart Yoffe, Henry Sackett,

Predictions And

Questions Time

USC By 20; Staunton Wins 81-0

This writer is offering his readers
one of the few sure things in mod-
ern football this week. Taking along
an interpreter to fight the language
barrier, I spoke with the local color
on Lexington High School’s foot-
ball fortunes, and the consensus is
the Scarlet Hurricane just don’t
have the horses this year. In an
exciting ball game last week, Robert
E. Lee of Staunton took advantage
of a few breaks to squeak by our
heroes, 81-0. Coupling the psycholog-
ical effect of last week with Coach
Brewbaker’s exile in Zelda’s, we
have to lean toward Halifax High
in this weekend’s encounter.

VMI is hoping for a little of their
early season luck against Virginia
Saturday. In the George Washing-
ton game, a VMI pass hit the in-
tended end’s back, bounced off a

 

George Washington defender, hit
another GW player, and finally was
grabbed by a Keydet in the end
zone to put a big six on the score-
board. Sounds a little like the AFL.

It’s time again, fans—here is to-
day’s two question “quickie”:

(1) Identify the following with the
sport which has made them notorious
or famous, or both

a. “Wrong Way” Reigals, b. Ralph
Branca, c. Bob McHenry, d. Al Rol-
lins, e. Bill Spivey, f. “Buzz’ Mc-
Bride.

1. baseball, 2. basketball, 3. golf,
4. lacrosse, 5. hockey, 6. football.

(2) Match the nicknames with
the famous sports figures:

a.“Battlin’ Bob,” b. “Jolly Ollie,” c.
Rabbit (“Bunny”), d. “Tricky Dick,”
e. “Easy Ed.”

The freshman soccer team scored
three quick goals in the early stages
of the first quarter and used this
cushion to coast to a 5-2 victory
over Augusta Military Academy to
even its record of 1-1.

In the first game they were de-
feated by the Lynchburg J.V. by
a score of 2-1, as the center forward
Jim Cogar scored the only goal
for W&L. As the opposition sub-
stituted frequently members of the
varsity soccer team, the close de-
feat was considered a bright view

of things to come. Still coach Bob
Lathrop saw the need for improve-
ment in defense and passing offense.

“We're going to have a good sea-
son...tremendous ability when we
get our passing game down and our
defensive responsibilities mastered,”
coach Lathrop commented. “We def-
initely see a much better than
break-even season. We've got five or
six guys that'll certainly play varsity
ball next year. They’ve got the abil-
ity—just lack experience in college
competition.”

A good team effort sparked the
5-2 vietory. An effective offense and
a stubborn defense kept the visitors
bottled up in their own half most of

the game as the W&L offense move-
ment predominated. The first score
came in the opening minutes of the
first quarter as John Lambeer kick-
ed a corner kick to Jim Cogar who
headed it in for a 1-0 lead. Moments
later a long pass from mid-field to
Cogar again set up the score as the

Keep The Ball Rolling

Last Saturday at the W&L-Oberlin game the student body
did something that a student body at Washington and Lee
hasn’t done since the days that Gil Bocetti carried the pig-
skin for the Generals—they actually cheered in an organized
manner. School spirit may be a trite subject but it is one that
deserves attention. I have often times heard some ‘‘mature”
upperclassmen state that he “‘didn’t really care if everyone
yelled or not—we keep on winning so it really doesn’t matter,
besides I’m going to Roanoke to watch a real football team
play.” By this “real” football team I suppose he meant our
big brother to the north—UVa.

Just what makes a “real’’ football team? A 250-pound
tackle from the Pennsylvania coal mines who claims he likes
the aspect of body contact with a 145-pound halfback? Or
perhaps a 210-pound fullback who has the facial characteris-
tics of the missing link? These individuals certainly may add
to the color of a team but do they add anything to the school
of which they are a part? If the school is football-minded then
they do.

Let us look at Washington and Lee. We (ever since 1954)
are basically not a football-minded school although some of
our opponents seem to think so. W&L is the ‘“‘gentleman’s
school of the South” (if I may use the term). We play a
gentleman’s brand of football. We have no ‘‘mooses’’’ we
have no “animals,”’ just plain football players. If we played
in a different league maybe we would have these individuals,
but the fact remains that we don’t engage in this manly sport
with teams such as Alabama, Georgia Tech, etc. We play in
our own, sedate, insignificant College Athletic Conference and,
gentlemen, are tops in this conference.

Everyone realizes that it would be much more interesting
to cheer for a team that is nationally recognized. What a lot
of people don’t realize is that W&L is nationally recognized—
in its own way. Face it—we are a small college and we don’t
field teams that could beat USC 37-0 or Alabama 21-0. I’m
not saying that this is our fate, accept it, and live with it. What
I’m saying is that we owe it our team to give them some de-

sparky center forward upset the
goalie in running the score to 2-0.
Before the quarter had ended, Cogar
made it 3-0 by heading in a Brad
Shinkle corner-kick pass.

After about three minutes in the
second period Skeet Krumperman
put the ball in play with a down-
field pass which, seconds later gave
Cogar his forth goal of the day.

About midway through the third
quarter Watkins smashed a pass
from Pete Heumann through the
goalie to make the score 5-0. The
game remained as such until the
closing minutes of the game when
a ball went up in the air near the
W&L goal. Coming down it was de-
flected off the head of one of the
defenders and sailed untouched into
the net for the visitors’ first score
of the lay. Seconds later A.M.A.
tallied on their own as goalie Ward
Briggs dove for a squibbling ball.

Sem Cheerleaders Arouse
Team, Crowds At Games

By BRUCE WHELIHAN

For the past two weeks, as reg-
ular attendants at Wilson Field are
aware, six girls from Southern Sem-
inary have cheered the Generals
to victory. Wearing cheerleader
sweaters and adorned with corsages
by the Varsity Club, the girls hop
and holler to arouse the crowd.

The six young women are all
seniors and cheerleaders for the

A post-game reception for the
alumni was held this year instead of
a cocktail party so that the alumni
would have the opportunity to meet
the coaches and captains of the foot-
ball team. The reception was quite
successful as it was well attended
and the possibility exists for such
a receptio nnext year.

The highlight of the Alumni
Homecoming was the rededication of
Lee Chapel. The newly renovated
structure was praised by the alumni
as they toured the Chapel and Mu-
seum. Mr. Washburn was quite
pleased” with the proceedings of
the weekend.

show this year will feature a cast
of 18, including seven actors who
will be making their first appearance
on the Troubadour stage.

Called both a provocative satire

language playwright Max Frisch. It
involves the confrontation of a pros-
perous yet cowardly German busi-
ness man, Gottlieb Biedermann, with
two uninvited guest who have come
to burn down his home and the rest
of his town. Concerned only with)
saving himself, Biedermann attempts
appeasement in dealing with the
two arsonists only to discover
he has aided them in his own des-

Tim Dols Plays

Tim Dols,

a senior, will play

title role of Gottlieb Biedermann,
the wealthy, cowardly, middle-class
citizen who disdains the unpleas-

antness that a fight with evil forces
would necessarily involve him. Mrs.
Yvonne Dickens, wife of David B.
Dickens, Professor of German, will
play Babette Biederman, Gottlieb’s
wife, whose apathy maks her equal-
ly guilly of the outcome. Together
they unwittingly fall prey to the
evil plans of the Firebugs.

The arsonists, Willi Eisinring
and Sepp Schmitz, will be played by
Steve Colvin and Joe Volpe. Both
roles are seen as contrasting views
of evil: the sauve and subtle ex-
head waiter, and the not-so-stupid,
brutal wrestler. It is their antics
and witty and double talk which
so bewilder Biedermann that he
becomes an accomplice to the very
crime he is try to prevent: the des-
truction of his own home.

The Ghee Of ee Past

It was in November of 1956 that the Interfraternity
Council voted through a resolution which limited to five
the number of houseparties which could be held on an
off-weekend. This action was taken, we presume, to molli-
fy the townsfolk, to lessen the task of Proctor Murray in
supercising a party weekend, and very simply to hold with-
in a reasonable limit the number of parties on campus
during the school year.

The rule has been a very good one with one excep-
tion. There are eighteen fraternities on campus; there
are three weekends in December, at the most, on which
Christmas parties can be held. This has meant that three
fraternities have had to schedule their Christmas affairs
out of season. This year there are only two available
weekends for parties between Thanksgiving and Christ-
mas, which made the IFC painfully aware of the need for
modification of the old rule.

Last Friday afternoon the problem was solved for this
year by the Faculty Committee on Fraternities. At the
request of IFC president Art Broaddus, the Committee
voted to allow all eighteen fraternities to hold their Christ-
mas parties on one of the two weekends available in De-
cember.

Two stipulations go along with this allowance: the
houses must agree amongst themselves through the IFC
to hold nine parties one weekend and nine the next; and
all parties must be closed, and must remain closed, during
the entire course of the party.

We wish to point out that it is because of the fore-
sight of IFC president Broaddus that this measure has
been passed. The Faculty Committee on Fraternities has
always been willing to listen to such a proposal, but the
IFC has been remiss in presenting it.

Last year, a proposal went before the Faculty Com-
mittee, but it came too late in the fall to be considered
and voted upon. Fraternities therefore owe their Christ-
mas parties not only to the consideration of the Faculty
Committee, but to Art Broaddus, for presenting the prob-
lem enough in advance for it to receive proper attention.

 

Buy More Dance Plans

Dance Plans go on sale for the last time this week.
Representatives from the Dance Board will be present
during the lunch hour at all fraternity houses.

We would remind students that the Dance Board
does not belong to Ed Croft or to the Dance Board Ad-
visory Committee. It belongs to the students themselves,
and as much or as little can be done by Croft and those
who assist him as the students will allow.

Those who are holding out on buying a Dance Plan
to disappoint the Dance Board will only wind up hurting
themselves. Ray Charles cannot be hired unless the vast
majority of the student body has supported the year-long
plan of the Dance Board.

Boycotters would do well to take a second thought and
consider the damage that would be done to the prestige
of Washington and Lee’s social life should they persist.

‘Birdie Panned As Poor,
But Typical Of Musicals

By TOM PACE

A critical statement of sorts. It would be my desire to spend each
week writing a major work or an attempt at real cinematic art.
I would like nothing better than to have a “Jules and Jim” (pro) or
a “Manchurian Candidate” (con) to review every Tuesday. How-
ever, relatively few of these films are made each year, the majority
of films being comparable to second and third rate literature. It
is the plight of the self-appointed movier-goer to while away his
valueless time watching many of these poorer movies, and the
plight of self-appointed critics to write about them. It is not my
fervent wish that each of you develop a new high personal standard
of criticism. That is dependent on each individual’s own interest.
Rather I would merely give my own opinion of the film and explain
as best I could why I felt however I did feel. Unfortunately most
weeks are rather bare movie-wise and I am unable to force myself
to writ an entire column on any one film. Thus I have excused
the following column.

The Fault of Musicals

“Bye Bye Birdie” affords a remarkably apt illustration of why
musicals never quite seem to go on the screen. Though sometimes
the music alone might prove entertaining to many, the idea behind
a musical seems to be not to leave the music alone. Instead each
song must be acted out, and usually very poorly. The fact that the
only successful portions of this film are when the principals do
nothing but sing, points out precisely this major fault in all musicals.
(For, in fact, I can’t remember seeing an honestly great musical
ever, though this may surprise admirers of “West Side Story.”)

Nonetheless I must admit there were some attractive things
about “Bye Bye Birdie.” Ann-Margaret’s opening, when she sings
the title song, hints that there are better things to come, which sadly
never do. Also Jessie Pearson’s characterization of Conrad Birdie
is nearly worth the price of admission alone. Yet Bobby Rydell,
Ann-Margaret, Janet Leigh, and Dick Van Dyke in that order are
very disappointing.

New French Film

At the Lyric now is a French film entitled “Tomorrow is My
Turn” which, if nothing else, is a suggestive title. I have not seen
the film, but plan to because of its advanced billing. Several critics
have squandered praise on it, so hopefully there is something in
it.

It’s Nice To Be Normal

Once we had eaten and were lying down on the
ground I looked up through the trees at one star and
I tried to concentrate so hard on it that I began to be
hypnotized and the star got blurry and a lot bigger
and the hemlock trees with the fire reflecting on them
reminded me of Christmas. I was trying so hard to
experience the moment for the moment’s sake and not
something to remember and write about and I was at
the same time wondering why people never paint
picture of trees while they are underneath them look-
ing up and also remembering a time when I had been
in Florida and my mother had gotten a ticket for
running a red light and the cop had pulled us off the
road under the same kind of trees when Nick asked
me where the cigarettes were. Somebody will always
ask you something like that when you don’t want them
to.

Before the night had come and the sun had been
shining on the leaves of the poplar trees above the
hemlocks, the leaves had been bright yellow and green
and red; but when the sun was low they stopped
being that way and instead reminded me of helium
balloons at the cireus which are held back from going
into the sky by the top of the big tent after the show
is over. It was really sad then and the air reminded
me of prep school in the late fall dusk, but later
darkness came, and I couldn’t see the leaves of the
tall trees any more so I stopped thinking about them,
and instead concentrated on the hemlock’s web-like
branches that were glowing white on the underneath
side which reminded me, As I said of Christmas. It’s
nice to be normal at Christmas.

W&L Coach Does Summer Duty

 

Coach Lord Makes Army Tour

By GARETH ADEN
Feature Editor

It is likely that few Washington
and Lee students realize that coach
Norman F, Lord of the schools phy-
sical education department is “one
of the nation’s foremost authorities
on the organization and conduct of
intramural sports,”

As proof of this statement, coach
Lord was selected by the United
States Army to travel in Germany,
France, and Italy last summer. The
trip was generally to evaluate the
army’s intramural programs in
camps in these countries, and lasted
from the beginning of July through
the first week in August.

The illustrious coach, of both
track and freshman camp fame,
said he felt the vital purpose of
the trip was “to promote more uni-
versal participation in Army in-
tramural sports; so that all sol-
diers, not just the expert athlete,
could benefit from sports partici-
pation.” The goal, he added, was
the goal of college intramural pro-

 

grams as well, “Boys just don’t
realize it, that’s all.”

Coach Lord said that the first part
of the tour was devoted specifically
to traveling from camp to camp and
observing the intramural programs
at each. From this observation he
drew up a personal report with sug-
gested changes and sent this report
to Washington.

During the last two weeks of the
trip, Lord said that he and Mr. Rob-
bert Baird, a civilian consultant for
the Southern European Task Force,
held clinics conducting intramural
sports. He explained that four clin-
ics in all were held; one in Orleans,

France, and the other three in the
German towns of Frankfort, Bad
Tolz, and Kaiserslantern.

With a wry smile, the track men-
tor pointed out that the clinics were
very similar to a school in schedule
and routine. Classes ran from 8
am. to 5 p.m., and were attended
by athletic commanders from the
surrounding camps.

"I tried to impress upon them.”
said Lord, “The importance of
everyone’s participation in sports,
especially the less-athletic soldier.
The benefits of previous sports
competition to military and com-

Tonight I had the misfortune to
attend a fraternity “rally,” or pledge
hazing session. I saw leering, half-
drunk upperclassmen shouting and
screaming at near-exhaused fresh-
men who continue to submit them-
selves to further inane indignities.
Some fraternities have had the
maturity to abolish these pointless
sessions of sadism and replace them

with constructive pledge training
programs.
Others continue to show their

lack of imagination and blind devo-
tion to a stupid tradition by re-
fusing even to try a more intelli-
gent alternative.

I can’t help wondering how all
this is reconciled to the idea of the
“W&L gentleman.”

Everyone who attended the Re-
dedication of Lee Chapel was most
impressed with the service as a
whole, and particularly with the
Glee Club’s performance.

The Glee Club’s singing of Col-

ed many alumni, and rightfully so.

My only regret was that the Uni-
versity felt compelled to outlaw
Homecoming displays for fear of de-
tracting from the dignity of the re-
dedication.

In the past displays have not only
helped spark student interest in
Homecomings, but have been an ex-
cellent means of cooperation among
the various pledge classes.

be a matter of pride that when
Washington and Lee men are gather-

quite well behaved.

Sackett Shines At Homecomings

By JIM CROTHERS
Assistant Sports Editor

Somewhat overshadowed in previ

ous games, halfback Henry Sackett

broke loose Saturday at Homecoming scoring 16 points and gaining 101

yards in ten carries, to lead Washin
Centre College (Ky.) in a College A
the Generals’ third victory this sea-*
son and extends their undefeated
string to eight straight over two
seasons.

Sackett kept two W&L drives alive
with jaunts of 33 and 34 yards and
helped get the Generals’ first scor-
ing thrust started by returning Cen-
tre’s first punt 26-yards to midfield.
From where Washington and Lee
marched to the Colonel 1-yard line
where Stuart Yoffe skirted end for
the tally and his forth TD of the
year. Sackett then added the two-
point conversion to give the Gen-
erals an 8-0 lead midway through
the first quarter.

Second Score

The second W&L score was set up
when Yoffe intercepted a Centre
aerial and carried it to the Colonel
37. Sackett, on the first play, swept
end and literally ran over several
would-be tacklers to bring the ball
to the Centre 3-yard line. Three
plays later the Lynchburg resident
tallied his first touchdown giving
Washington and Lee a_ half-time
lead of 14-0, after a two-point con-
version failed.

Yoffe, W&L’s candidate for Little
All-American, ran the opening
second-half kickoff back to the
Centre 48 and a personal foul moved
the ball to the Colonel 33. Sackett
scored his second TD of the after-
noon soon afterwards and passed to
quarterback, John McDaniel, for the
two-point conversion.

Strong defensive efforts by the
blue and red W&L units contained
the Kentuckians. Linemen Buck
Ogilvie, John Madison, Jim Sylves-
ter, Bill Angel, and Bill Gossman
all contributed fine play; linebackers

Joe Miller and Mike Sheffey also
helped restrain Centre. Sheffey,
along with Yoffe and Bill David,

doing particularly outstanding jobs.
Red Unit Drives

Late in the third period, after
stopping a Centre drive, Washington |
and Lee’s red unit drove 87 yards
in 18 plays for the final General
score. A fifteen-yard roughing the
kicker penalty began the drive and
quarterback, A. J. Barranco, then
relied on passes to halfback Bill
David to keep the thrust alive. With
7:50 left in the game, Barranco hit
David, the General’s leading pass-
receiver, on the 11 where he sped
over for the touchdown.

Centre scored its lone tally on a
one-yard plunge by halfback John
Murphy, and a two-point conver-
sion pass from E. Jackson to Mark
Lindsay late in the fourth quarter.
A final scoring drive by W&L’s gold
unit was thwarted by an intercepted

Harriers Trip
Eagles, 18-43;

O’Conner 1st'®

By LARRY CRAIG
Tuesday Sports Writer
The Washington and Lee cross-
country team rang up a runaway
voctory Saturday by easily defeating
a strong Bridgewater team 18-43.

This victory was the Generals’ first | faMgaam

over the Eagles, but was their third
straight without a loss this season.

Riff O’Conner ran first with his
best time, 25:00 minutes over the
hilly General 4.1 mile course. Andy
Kilpatrick, harrier captain for the
1963 season, finished second with
the time of 25:25; and Lee Johnson
crossed the finish line fourth in
25:26 minutes.

W&L bunched its first five men
within 1:01 minutes, and the initial
seven were separated by only 1:10
minutes. As has been the case in
the previous two meets, the Gener-
als’ exceptional depth provided the
margin of victory. It is this depth
on which Coach Dick Miller places
his hopes for victory against Old
Dominion this week.

This year’s team presents quite a
paradox. There isn’t a senior on the
W&L roster, but Coach Dick Miller
will field a veteran squad; there is

-|that defeat with a comment of “Ex-

actly the same as two years ago. Un-
believable.”

Generals Lead
The Generals jumped off to a lead
midway in the first quarter when
Mell set up Steve Hibbard about
four yards from the goal. Hibbard
netted it to account for all of the
W&L scoring.

 

Soccer Team Suffers First Defeat;
Hibbard Scores Lone W&L Goal

The 1-0 lead held up until the
third quarter when the Wolfpack
came through with the tying and
winning goals. The first came on a
perfect set up pass by Artinano
to Ferrand, who scored from about
15 yards. Alencastro tallied the win-
ning goal about nine minutes later.
He booted in a loose ball from about
two yards out .

The Generals had no individual
stars in this losing effort, but did not
lose because of poor playing either.
It was a great team effort, but the
breaks went against them. Actually,
the winners showed a rather un-
coordinated team effort in the rough
game that saw many fouls called.
W&L just missed too many shots.

Explanation
Coach Lyles had his explanation
for the defeat. “They had better
passing than we did, as I expected.
We don’t take off with the ball
quickly enough and then we don’t
pass quickly enough.”

On Campus sc?s0

(By the Author of ‘Rally Round the Flag, Boys!” and,
“Barefoot Boy With Cheek.’’)

BOOM!

Today, foregoing levity, let us turn our keen young minds to
the principal problem facing American colleges today: the
population explosion. Only last week four people exploded in
Cleveland, Ohio—one of them while carrying a plate of soup.
In case you’re thinking such a thing couldn’t happen anywhere
but in Cleveland, let me tell you about two other cases last
week—a 45-year-old man in Provo, Utah, and a 19-year-old
girl in Northfield, Minnesota. And, in addition, there was a
near miss in High Point, North Carolina—an eight-year-old
boy who was saved only by the quick thinking of his cat, Fred, who
pushed the phone off the hook with his muzzle and dialed the
department of weights and measures. (It would, perhaps, have
been more logical for Fred to dial the fire department, but one
can hardly expect a cat to summon a fire engine which is fol-
lowed by a Dalmatian, can one?)

But I digress. The population explosion, I say, is upon us.
It is, of course, cause for concern but not for alarm, because I
feel sure that science will ultimately find an answer. After all,

 

has not science in recent years brought us such marvels as the
maser, the bevatron, and the Marlboro filter? Oh, what a saga
of science was the discovery of the Marlboro filter! Oh, what a
heart-rending epic of trial and error, of dedication and perse-
verance! And, in the end, what a triumph it was when the
Marlboro research team, after years of testing and discarding
one filter material after another—iron, nickel, tin, antimony,
obsidian, poundcake—finally emerged, tired but happy, from
their laboratory, carrying in their hands the perfect filter
cigarette! Indeed, what rejoicing there still is whenever we
light up a Marlboro which comes to us in soft pack and Flip-
Top Box in all fifty states and Cleveland!

Yes, science will ultimately solve the problems arising from
the population explosion, but meanwhile America’s colleges
are in dire straits. Where can we find classrooms and teachers
for today’s gigantic influx of students?

Well sir, some say the solution is to adopt the trimester sys-
tem. This system, already in use at many colleges, eliminates
summer vacations, has three semesters per annum instead of
two, and compresses a four-year-course into three years.

This is, of course, good, but is it good enough? Even under
the trimester system the student has occasional days off. More-
over, his nights are utterly wasted in sleeping. Is this the kind
of all-out attack that is indicated?

I say no. I say desperate situations call for desperate reme-
dies. I say that partial measures will not solve this crisis. I
say we must do no less than go to school every single day of
the year. But that is not all. I say we must go to school 24
hours of every day!

The benefits of such a program are, as you can see, obvious.
First of all, the classroom shortage will disappear because all
the dormitories can be converted into classrooms. Second, the
teacher shortage will disappear because all the night watchmen
can be put to work teaching solid state physics and Restoration
drama. And finally, overcrowding will disappear because every-
body will quit school.

Any further questions? @ 1963 Max Shulman

+ + *

Yes, one further question: the makers of Marlboro, who
sponsor this column, would like to know whether you have
tried a Mariboro lately. It’s the filter cigarette with a man’s
world of flavor. Settle back and enjoy one soon.

For Troubs

(Continued from page 1)

Chorus of Firemen

Adding to the theatrical ingen-
uity of this comic play will be the
use of a chorus of nine firemen, led
by Charles Bright. Commenting,
warning, and performing much the
same function as the chorus of a
Greek comedy, the firemen include
Bill Chaplin and Bob Fusell, seniors,
Steve Millard and Syd Parum, soph-
omores, and Bob Baker, Jom Cogar,
Jay Hight and Jim Luck, freshmen.
This choral device represents a trend
in modern drama to heighten enter-
tainment in unusual and unfamiliar
ways.

Also featured in The Firebugs will
be Lockhart Handley as the traitor-
ous Ph.D. and Lewis Davis as the
policeman. Reappearing on the Troub
stage this year will be two Lexing-
ton High School students, Betsy
Letcher and Kendall Jamison as
Anna and Mrs. Knechtling.

Volpe Makes Debut

Betsy Letcher and Tim Dols were
seen last year during the spring
one-act play festival, having lead
roles in The Apoollo of Bellac. Also
seen at tht time was Steve Colvin
who was the sole player in Samuel
Becketts Krapp’s Last Tape. Charles
Bright was seen most recently in
Mollere’s Tartuffe as was Kendall
Jamison. Joe Volpe will make his
debut on the Troubadour stage this
fall, although he has had consider-
able experience in summer drama
groups. In all, seven actors will
make their first appearance on the
Troub stage with The Firebugs.

Biederman and the  Firebugs
will be performed November 6-9
at the Troubadour Theatre. Season
tickets will be available at the box-
office throughout the first perfor-
mance.

 

NOTICE
The management of the National
Symphony Orchestra notified the

Rockbridge Concert-Theater Series
Monday that because of the strike of
the musicians the Lexington concert
scheduled for October 17 had to be
canceled. Negotiations toward settle-
ment of the strike continue and it is
probable that a Lexington visit by the

in the season. Subscribers are assured
of a full four-event season. The open-
ing concert will be the recital by
Teresa Stitch-Randall, soprano, on
Nov. 21.

It was night and at the seashore and warm (for it

sat there in the dark, on the beach, with just a pair of
shorts on. He was content there: that passive content-
ment that comes only when all the senses are satisfied
in just being—being there existing, enjoying. But
what was there to enjoy there? Not much. Only the
sound of the lapping surf in his ears, the feel of rough
particles of sand rubbing against his skin, the smell
of salt air stinging his nostrils, the taste of no-taste
inside his mouth (for he had been drinking), and the
sight of nothing in particular (for it was, as I said,
dark there, and even more dark because there was
no moon there). Maybe there was enjoyment or rather

Liberalized Cut Proposal
Nears Faculty Completion,
Dean Atwood Informs IFC

By HOWARD EPSTEIN
Staff Reporter

Dr. E. C. Atwood, Dean of Stu-
dents told the Interfraternity Council
last night that the cut proposal sent
to the faculty last spring is nearing
a stage of completion. It still is indefi-
nite as to when the proposal will go
before the faculty at large for con-
sideration.

In that the proposal has not been
released from committee at this time,
and considering that it may be altered
in faculty session after it is proposed,
it is thought best not to reveal any
of the features of the proposal at
this time.

Introduced Last May

The original proposition was intro-
duced last May by John Kirkley in
the form of a petition. After it re-
ceived signatures of 80 per cent of the
student body, Kirkley presented it
before a joint faculty committee which
appointed a subcommittee to draw
up and study the proposal.

The subcommittee has remained ac-
tive, and expects, according to Dr.
Atwood, to present its proposal and
findings to the entire faculty in about
a month.

Faculty Invitations

Also at the meeting, the annual
problem of faculty invitations to fra-
ternity houses on Parents Day was
discussed. It was pointed out by IFC
President Art Broaddus, that last year
many faculty members had to refuse
a great number of invitations. He
therefore suggested that each frater-
nity invite only a few faculty mem-
bers.

Immediately after the suggestion was
accepted, Dr. Atwood added that al-
ready one fraternity had issued in-
vitations to 90 members of the facul-
ty.

Following this discusion the council
chose Tuesday, October 29 as the date
for the Student-Faculty Banquet.

The final action taken by the council
was the acceptance of the conditions
set down by the faculty pertaining to
fraternity Christmas parties. It was
stipulated that only nine parties would
be allowed on each of the two week-
ends in December, and that these were
to be closed.

The trip was apparently not all

days in one camp and spent the

and a number of other high spots

 

Peter Sellers’ New Film,
‘Wrong Arm of the Law’,

Comes To Lyric This Week
(Continued from page 2)

If there isn’t, next Sunday a good
movie is coming fo rcertain. It is
one of eight for fourteen films that
Peter Sellers turns out each year,
and it is easily one of his best. “The
Wrong Arm of the Law” concerns a
gang of Sellers-led criminals who,
despite giving thorough considera-
tio nto each job, are always caught
in the act by the police. However,
the police simply take back the
stolen goods and never arrest the
gang.

Sellers and Jeffries ‘Excellent’

With this beginning you will be
led into one of the funniest films I
have seen for several years. Both
Sellers and Lionel Jeffries are ex-
cellent and they are aided by an
able supporting cast. Yet most credit
should go to the writers. Since,
however, they number seven I won’t
bother to praise them by name; I
will merely say their productive
effort is hilarious and they can cer-
tainly be charitable with one an-
other.

By W&L Coach

on the continent during his stay
Mrs. Lord went for the trip, and
according to the coach, kept a good
eye on him.

For me the highlights of the
trip was our tour of East Berlin,”
he indicated. “We had visas and
had no trouble passing the check
points. It is hard to explain the
difference between the two sec-
tions of Berlin; you really have to
go there. Everything in East Ber-
lin is run down. You can tell just
by the gait of the people that they
are down-trodden. There is no
sparkle in their eyes. West Berlin
was bustling.”

As to the success of the summer,
Coach Lord said he could not guess
exactly how much impact the clin-
ics or his report would have on
camp intramural systems. He did
feel, though, that changes for the
better would be made as a result.
He added that the tour was a great
professional opportunity for him.

“Even though the trip was fun
and both my wife and I enjoyed it,
we were both glad to get home. We
both were exhausted.” Anyone
who has had the good coach for
P.E. would find that last statement
a little hard to believe; he never
seem to tire. Enthused as_ ever,
Norman Lord is now back at W&L
expounding the virtue of the “Fear-
ome Four” to digruntled students.

Noted economist Dr. David Mc-
Cord Wright spoke in Lee Chapel
yesterday on “The Social Idea Be-
hind Full Employment.”

Wright, who presently teaches at
the University of Georgia, spoke to
a nearly full auditorium. He is con-
servative in his economic thought

He ascribed unemployment in
America today to the slow rate of
economic growth. This low rate in
turn Wright charged largely to the
entrenched pressure groups of both
labor and management, which have
consistently resisted the changes
necessary for progress.

The “major factor” behind full
employment, said Wright, is “mo-
bility of resources,’ which means
continual change in means of pro-
duction and in consumption pat-
terns.

“Complete disruption of the entire
social structure” may be necessary
for change, Wright pointed out. He
compared this phenomenon as_ it
happens in capitalistic and in social-
ist countries and stated that the
socialists have not solved the prob-
lem any better than has the United
States. There is insecurity under so-
cialism just as under capitalism;
commissars can be replaced.

The next factor nesded for
gress, McCord said, is a favorable
attitude on the part of the people.
If they are not willing to undergo
changes, there can be no progress.
The ultimate disease in an economic
system is “growing unwillingness to
run risks and submit to change.”
Progress cannot continue without
constant discomfort for many peo-
Pie. “This,” said _Wright, “is the

UCA Initiates Service Project

By CHARLIE FLIPPEN

The University Christian Associa-
tion is forming a committee of stu-
dents which will work with patients
at Western State Mental Institute.

One group has already been to the
hospital, and another group tenta-
tively plans to go this Sunday.

Two Programs

The committee has two specific
programs which it plans to imple-
ment at the hospital.

Under one program, the members
will go over in groups of five or six.
Hach group will work with some
20 to 30 patients.

Bob Scheelen,
“For

The second program will be on an
individual basis. Each student will
find a person he is particularly in-
terested in. He will talk to him and
perhaps later he will be able to take
him to town.

Regular Visits

The organization is now trying to
establish regular times for the group
visits. “We would like to get a reg-
ular group for Sunday, and if pos-
sible, another regular group during
the week. This way the men could
come to expect us at a certain time
every week,” Scheelen, a sophomore,
said,

At the moment the committee's
major problem is transportation.
“Only a couple of the boys have
ears and this could make getting
back and forth a difficulty,” Schee-

len said.

“Anyone who has a car and would
be interested in helping should con-
tact me,” he said.

There is also plenty of room for
ether volunteers. Approximately 25
or 30 boys have shown an interest
in working on the committee. “But
there about 2,500 patients at the
hospital. The possibilities for
are unlimited,” Scheelen said.

The UCA first started working at
Western State late last semester.
that time they only attempted the
group program.

The hospital itself is greatly un-
derstaffed, Scheelen said. The com-
mittee service is therefore a real
aid.

Dr. Luther Hodges, faculty advi-
sor to the UCA, commenting on the
program said that it was an expres-
sion of the social service function
of the association,

“The main thing about the pro-
gram is that it affords the men there
virtually their only contact with the
outside world.

“At the same time it brings us into
contact with another world, too,” he
said.

Mutual Benefits

Echoing Hodges’ opinion Scheelen
said “It benefits both them and us.”

“We help them as much as pos-
sible. And at the same time we hope
to help ourselves to mature, to get
|a broader outlook and_ perhaps,
stabilize our own personalities.”

 

This committee is one of a num-
ber of semi-independent committees

Economist Wright Discusses
US Unemployment Problem

 

seamy side of the case for capital-
ism; but on the other hand it is a
prerequisite for the progress we val-
ue.”

Wright said that present United
States policies are unlikely to cor-
rect our economic problems. U.S.
policies are unlikely to correct our
economic problems. U.S. prices are
much out of line with those of the
rest of the world, he charged, and
U.S. productivity is too low. He at-
tacked a tax cut, calling it “il-
lusionary” and stating that saving
“will not be very great.”

Wright spoke under the auspices
of the Visiting Scholars Program of
the University Center in Virginia.
One of America’s most respected
economists, he is the author of The
Creation of Purchasing Power and
The Economics of Disturbance.

 

Dorm Petitioners

Denied Request

Two occupants of the upperclass
dormitories initiated a petition last
week requesting administration ap-
proval for the privilege of having
female guests in Baker and Davis
dormitories.

Maurice Fliess and Grayson Pow-
ell, W&L sophomores, got up a pe-
tition signed by forty-three occu-
pants of the two dormitories. There
are only seventy-nine occupants in
both dorms, a large number of whom
are law students. The petition con-

 

sisted only of undergraduate sig-
natures.

This petition was presented to the
Administration which met and dis-
cussed the petition on two different
eccasions. After considerable discus-
sion, the Committee concluded that:
“While the members of the Admin-
istrative Committee sympathized
with the reasons motivating the re-
quest, they were unwilling to rec-
ommend such a change at this time.’

Problems discussed included the
fact that the dormitory rooms are
bedrooms, freshmen and _fraterni-
ties are not allowed to have girls in
their bedrooms, and an added bur-
den was placed on dormitory coun-
selors.

Also, it was felt that local girls
schools would be somewhat upset
about the potential consequences.

NOTICE

There will be a meeting of non-
fraternity freshmen for the purpose
of interviewing both Stuart Fine-
stone and Bryant Kendrick, fresh-
men EC candidates from the Pro-
gressive and University parties re-
spectively.

The meeting will be held at 7:00,
Sunday night, in Room 27 of the
Student Union building. All Inde-
pendent freshmen are urged to at-
tend, in order to meet both candi-
dates, and to vote for the one you

 

 

consider the best qualified.

Openin ¢ Dances

The first school-wide social function for the 1963-64 dance

" season begins this afternoon with the Openings Cocktail

Party. This party is given in honor of John Moore, a member
of Delta Tau Delta fraternity. Moore is President of both
Openings Dance Weekend and the sophomore class.

ligned magazine is probably appear-
ing on schedule, latest reports pro-
nounce. The Southern Collegian

.| covers steamed into the print shop

in the arms of a giant teamster on
Saturday morning, and the first
phase of printing was all completed
by noon. Barring some other prema-
ture calamity the finished product
will be distributed next Saturday to
a number of locations, possibly in-
cluding the Student Union if Federal
troops choose not to intervene.

An interview with the elusive
staff yielded little information as
to the character of their creation.
In answer to allegations that the
Collegian was one of the more can-
cerous publications currently ap-
pearing on American campuses, Edi-
tor-in-Chief Tompkins admitted that
it probably was “the most outstand-
ing literary tumor ever harbored by
a university organism,” but that a
biopsy of those involved would re-
veal that they are, as a matter of
record, essentially benign and never
malignant. In any event, he avowed,
there was little danger that the Col-
legian would get any bigger after
the forthcoming issue. It might, in
fact, be excised from the student
corpus entirely, suggested one of
the printers, who said that it was the
first Collegian in a year to foul the
machinery with what, in his opinion,
looked like hairs.

The staff is entirely and solely
representative of the student body
and their whims and foibles, accord-
ing to its leader, and is an order of
mystics, not subversives. Hope was
expressed that the more occult is-
sue this weekend would not offend
anyone. Famously devoted to pre-
senting a personalized brand of hu-
mor to the campuses of the Old
Dominion, the Collegian claims in-
nocense from all vices and is essen-
tially loyal to its parent institution,
spoke the Editor. He further an-
nounced that the theme of this hu-
morous Openings issue was therefore
“Make Frinds With Freshmen” be-
cause first, “in freshmen lies the
destiny of the Southern Collegian;
the future editor is in there some-
where,” and secondly, “they’re so
funny.”

As to his chances of maintaining
the editorship in the face of a more
conservative faculty, Tompkins
doubted he could be taken alive and
pictured his possible demise by re-
calling the tombstone inscription of
the Openings 1959 issue:

“The sun’s rim dips; the stars rush

out:

At one stride comes the dark...”
and further he hoped there’d be no
moaning of the Bar, he said, “when
we embark.”

Debating

 

cocktail party which begins at four
o'clock and continues until six in the
evening. The Pine Room of the May-
flower Motor Hotel will be the site
of the party.

The Olympics achieved fame with
two of their first recordings, “West-
ern Movies,” and “The Hully Gully.”
Recently two more of their songs
have reached the top of national
record polls. These are “The
Bounce,” and “Dancin’ Holiday.” The
Olympics have recently appeared on
numerous nation-wide tours. They
appeared in Red Square during Fin-
als of last year.

Openings Dance

Tonight, Lloyd Price and his big
band will be featured at the Open-
ings Dance. The theme of this year’s
dance, “An Arabian Night,” should
present a striking change from pre-
vious decorations and themes. The
dance figure, presenting the officers
of Openings Weekend and their dates
will take place at approximately
ten o'clock.

Openings Dance will begin at
nine in the evening and continue
until one in the morning. Doremus
Gymnasium will serve as the site
of the dance. Formal attire is to
be worn at the dance. Ed Croft,
President of the University Dance
Board, indicated that short formals
or cocktail dresses will be suitable
for the women .

Lloyd Price has a list of million-
selling records which can be topped
by only a few singers. Almost every-
one remembers his single releases of
“Stagger Lee,” and “Personality.”
However, his list hits continues
with “Where Were You on My Wed-
ding Day,” and “Laudy, Miss
Claudy.”

Price is presently spending most
of his professional time playing in
night clubs and in a series of one-
night stands.

Fraternity Parties

Following the revelry of Friday
night, and the misery of Saturday
classes, the weekend will start up
with renewed vigor Saturday after-
noon will see the beginning of fra-
ternity parties. Among the combos
featured at the various fraternities
will be the Olympics, the Zodiacs,
the Thornton Sisters, and the Little
Boys. Fraternity parties will also
be given following the night con-
cert.

Roy Hamilton is the attraction at
Saturday night’s Opening Concert.
Again Doremus Gymnasium will
serve as the auditorium. The Up-
setters Band of Little Richard fame,
will accompany Hamilton.

The concert will begin prompt-
ly at eight in the evening. Stu-
dents attending the concert are
reminded that conventional dress
is to be worn at the concert.

Teams Go Undefeated,

Capture First Place At Davidson

Washington and Lee debaters took
first place in the Davidson Invita-
tion Tournament last week end, go-
ing undefeated in ten matches.

There were ten schools present
at the meet, each entering an af-
firmative and a negative team. The
W&L affirmative team was compos-
ed of Sam Frazier and John MeMur-
ry, and the negative was argued
by Rick Kneipper and Ed Fitzgerald.
The four met and defeated all the
other nine schools at least once.

Duke University finished second
in the standings, having only two
losses; they were followed by the
University of North Carolina.

The perfect record marked the
first time in W&L debate history
that both teams went undefeated in
tournament competition. Of the four
debaters, all are sophomores and
only one, Fitzgerald, is a veteran in
debating. Kneipper has had some
experience, but it was the first ma-
jor tournament for both Frazier and

MeMurry.

 

Coming events on the debating
schedule include a trip to Bridge-
water on October 30 by an eight-
man team. There will be an all
Washington and Lee novice tourna-
ment on Tuesday, November 29, and
W&L will send a four-man team of
freshmen to Wake Forest in Novem-
ber for the annual novice tourna-
ment there.

The question debated was “Re-
solved: that the Federal govern-
ment should guarantee to all quali-
fied high school graduates, an op-
portunity for higher education.”
Other schools participating in the
tournament were Duke, North Car-
olina, Davidson, Randolph-Macon,
Carson-Newman, Gardner-Webb,
Lynchburg, Western Carolina, and
Wingate.

William Chaffin, debate coach,
commented that the sophomore de-
baters show as much promise now as
the championship team of Al Eckes
and Bill Noell did two years ago.

Can They Be Saved?

The University dances, much as we hate to admit it, might
well become a thing of the past. An occasion that once was the
focal point of the W&L big weekend is beginning to peter out;
it may like so many other things fall a victim of changing
times.

If this decline in interest in the University dances continues,
we have a problem: whether to do away with them altogether,
or modify them to suit the changing wants of the student body.

 

The primary objection to the dance sets is that they lack
the conviviality, the festivity, of a combo party. A great deal of
this criticism stems from the fact that alcoholic beverages are
forbidden at the dances, a situation arising out of the Univer-
sity rule against on-campus drinking. The only way this rule
could be amended in any way is through the trustees.

Hollins overcame this difficulty by having its dances off
the campus. The amount of alcoholic consumption is restricted
by limiting the number of “‘drinking tickets” one can pur-
chase. The glaring obstacle for W&L, however, is trying to
find an ideal off-campus location.

What we predict is that when the problem becomes acute
enough, the student body will petition the board of trustees
to amend the constitutional rule, in order to make dance sets
an exception to total prohibition. As it stands now, the need
for this change is increasingly obvious. “The W&L gentleman”
is being taxed beyond human limitations: he must keep his date
entertained for four hours; there is no breaking in to relieve
him. What makes it worse for him is being on the wagon while
most of the fraternity brothers are living it up in some less
formal, more scintillating environment. In this light, it will be
hard for us to expect students to continue attending these
dances merely out of University spirit.

A Full Immunity

Polio, once thought defeated through the use of Salk
vaccine has returned. In Petersburg, Virginia, fourteen cases
of polio have been reported in the last two months. This past
week the outbreak reached the critical stage. A new, and more
permanent vaccine, the Sabin oral vaccine, was rushed to the
city. Within two days, well over 100,000 people had received
their first dose of vacine. Taken orally, on sugar lumps, the
Sabin vaccine made it possible to vaccinate a large population,
easily, quickly, and painlessly.

This Sunday, October 20, W&L students, and the resi-
dents of Lexington will be given the opportunity to receive
the first of three such vaccine boosters. Administration of the
vaccine will take place at the Lexington High School, from
two to five in the afternoon. There is no charge for the vaccine.

It is the duty, and responsibility, of every student to pro-
tect himself from this dreaded disease. Very little effort is
needed; all it takes is a swallow.

The Monday Polls

Freshmen will be facing their first election polls on Mon-
day. One source of discomfort for them is the constant pres-
sure to vote straight party. This pressure is exerted when the
respective pledge classes are warned that individual qualifica-
tions of a candidate are secondary; what comes first is the
interest of the party.

We point out to the freshmen that regardless of what you
are told, straight-party voting is not the rule here; the results
of the past few years have shown an ever-growing trend toward
independent thinking. You will be deciding on Monday wheth-
er or not you will join the University in perpetuating this trend.

Our Weekend Hosts

This afternoon will see the first achievement of a noble
goal long pursued by some of Washington and Lee’s most
spirited reformers: sponsorship of a University Cocktail
Party by one of the classes; i.e., wholesale provision of rum
punch by sophomore class dues. The Mayflower Hotel will
be the site of the historic occasion, which will no doubt be at-
tended by all campus luminaries without exception. On hand to
carry on will be the Olympics.

So it will be truly an auspicious moment that marks the
lifting from individual fraternities the burden of alone paying
for a Cocktail Party. The sophomores have paid for this first
party, and now they are responsible for making sure that it is
a good one. Since there is no home football game this week-
end, the sophomores can put all their class spirit into this
one contest: they can lead the way in downing the opponent
(rum punch). The Cocktail Party will be followed by a dance

in the evening for those who recover.

Origin Of Openings Traced To 1876,

Hop’, Cotillion Clubs The Instigators

By WARREN MONTGOMERY

Fall dances seem to have been
popular at W&L for almost a cen-
tury, but there has not always been
a fixed dance known as “Openings.” |
Our present form of Openings |

Dances is the result of a gradual}

evolution which is outlined below:

The first Calyx (1876) contains a|
paragraph about a “Fancy Dress |
Hop,” held in October. This was not |
an annual affair however. By 1879, |
there was what was known as the
Hop Club, which had the onaeeate |
bility of giving a fall dance.

In 1897, the first year of the Ring- |
tum Phi’s publication, the paper an- |
nounced that “the Cotillion Club |

gave a very delightful hop on the/&

eighth (of October).” This is the first |

reference to the Cotillion Club, |

which was to play a major role in |

the development of Openings until |

it ceased to exist in the 1950's.
1908

In this year, the “Opening Hop”
featured, according to the Calyx, “a
large number of visiting young ladies
from Lynchburg, Richmond, and
Staunton.”

In the early part of the century,
dances in October were almost total-
ly obscured by fall football, which
weekly occupied the entire front
page of the Ring-tum Phi. Fall
dances still went on, but the only
published reference to the Opening
Hop in 1916 was a small, 6th page
article in the R-t P which stated that
VMI was lending facilities to W&L
for the dance.

1917

The influence of the Great War
was felt in the 1917 hop. The new
Doremus Gymnasium was decorated
with the national colors and VMI

In 1919, for the first time, the
Ring-tum Phi ran a small front
page article on the dance. “Es-
pecially interesting,” announced the
paper, “were the ‘jazzations’ of the
drummer, whose work on the traps
and general demeanor on the plat-
form was enough to stop the dance
and attract myriads around him.”

   

ingredients of OPENINGS—1963

1925

Opening Hop was on October 17
and was informal, the music being
furnished by the now-defunct
“Southern Collegians.” Freshmen
were required to wear green bow
ties to the hop and could only stay
an hour unless they had dates or
were on the freshman football squad.

 

Communism, Conservatism
Base Ideology On Economy

By “Official Logician”
Reprinted from The Russian
Conservative

This is an inquiry into the nature
of man, although it does not con-
sider all men, deals with only a
superficial view of man, and is not
really an inquiry but a flat propa-
ganda statement. (Is student leader
raking self over coals?) Can the
Communist be a conservative? Is
there a place for a Communist in
the conservative movement, besides
those already there? I think there is
definitely a place for the Commun-

ist in the present conservative
movement, but first, a resort to
terminology.

What then is a “Communist”—and
a conservative—and how may one
man be both, without being schizo-
phrenic? Basically the Communist
must acknowledge himself to be a
Marx-made man and seek to follow
that political action which can best
serve his ends. Basically the Com-
munist believes that the material as-
pects of life, economic factors in
particular, are at the foundation of
all ideas and thus all cultural

 

achievement. As is revealed in the
life and teachings of Karl Marx,
“it is not the consciousness of men
which determines their existence,
but, on the contrary, it is their so-
cial existence which determines
their consciousness.”

And from Ameriea we learn that
the conservative “is interested in
maintaining a political order which
encourages man to realize the fullest
expresion of his individual talents.
He supports a capitalistic econo-
nomie system, subject to controls
against corruption, because he be-
lieves it best allows man’s fullest
expression and fulfillment.’ (Don
Partington, Southern Conservative,
page 4.)

Thus the strongest link between
the communist and the conserva-
tive is their common belief that the
determination of man’s ethics, mor-
als, and achievements is controlled
by economics. Communist and con-
servative alike recognize that man
after the Fall (of the Russian Czar
in 1917 when he was banished from
the palace by a burning sickle) does
not and is not influenced by ideas

 

Passed Out Teenage Idol

Serves As A

By DREW BAUR
Once upon a time (about a year
ago) in

a small, dirty, poorly lighted,
stuffy town there
| was a large, dirty,

poorly lighted,
stuffy building
with unoriginal
drawings on the
walls. A_ large
group of people

were gathered in
this room await-
ing the appear-
ance of the exalt-
ed one. Many of
the people were
standing round dreaming of the re-
placement of Al Jolson, Red Nichols,
and Louis Armstrong all combined.
The others were aimlessly wander-
ing around (almost as thought intox-
icated) wondering when the new
god of music would appear. Outside
in his big Cadillac the teenage idol
of adolescent America was passed
out.

 

Muttering menacing words the res-
tive crowd began to slowly leave
the large, dirty, poorly lighted, stuf-
fy building and filter into the smaller
buildings located nearer to the heart
of town. They were met in these

 

 

smaller buildings by the blaring of

Reminder

a huge jukebox, hidden in the far
corner of the room, pretending to
be a combo. It didn’t really fool the
other occupants of the building as
most of them were in much the
same shape as their idol in the big,
beige Cadillac. The mysterious rul-
ers of a powerful minority in the
town had previously decreed from
their hill hangout that on this par-
ticular night, all jukeboxes would
pose as combos. The result was an
unfortunate occasion for all involved,
except the top drawer entertain-
ment on the floor of the big, beige
Cadillac.
Moral; none, just a reminder.
IFC

All fraternities owe IFC president
Art Broaddus a vote of thanks for
his prompt action on Christmas
house parties. The IFC has finally
elected a responsible leader who
commands the respect of both facul-
ty and fraternities. Hopefully all
houses will obey the rules of the
IFC for the Christmas parties and
give Broaddus the support he de-
serves.

BEST BETS FOR THE WEEK-
END. Mizzou by two touchdowns,
Susquehanna by two points, a small
group at the Sunday magic show,
and Johnny Walker on the rocks,

outside the realm of the political
and material. And government, and
thus law, is only a political device
“to subordinate power to generally
approved purposes and ideas.” (Don
Partington, Southern Conservative,
page 4.)

The good Communist following the
“Manifesto” as an inspired doctrine
can’t help but also be a conservative,
or at least better not help it. Can
the Communist be a Conservative?
Yes, Yes. (Except for Chinese, of
course.) Remember: NiKR-4-64.
(That’s Nikita Khrushchev not kry-
ton nickel.)

By REN MANNING

The trouble with a school such
as this is that everyone is always
trying to protect the really big,
the really important things that give
Washington and Lee its widespread
prestige. They want to make its
academic strength even stronger, its
spiritual life even more impressive,
and its reputation of turning out
gentlemen even more pronounced.
These are the things which impress
the onlookers, bring nostalgic
thought to the alumni, and dazzle
the genteel of Lexington.

O.K., Pll agree. This is fine. ’m
all for it.

But as I said earlier, there is
danger here. By concentrating on
all these big things, the school
often neglects the little things that
make the student’s life here worth-
while and full of meaning—like
soap in the heads.

There is never any soap in the
dorms. Only once have I seen a bar
of soap in the gym, and that was
a dirty, gritty, warped thing that
I would no more touch than eat.
How many times have you gone into
the washroom and washed your
hands only to find the paper towel
dispenser empty? How does one go
about drying them? Does he wipe
them on his clothes and run the
risk of people’s noticing that may-
be...? Or does he wave them
around trying to dry them by sling-
ing all the water off and leaving
the rest to evaporation?

‘The Substance’

Speaking of soap a moment ago,
I forgot to mention the liquid sub-
stance in the showers that some
people have told me is supposed to
be some type of soap. I doubt it.
Have you ever tried to use that

 

stuff? It won’t even foam. It’s hardly

years

1935

In 35 the traditional fall dance
was combined with Homecoming to
create the “Homecoming Dances.”
W&L played Virginia Tech, and
VMI played the Wahoos. The price
of the dance set was $2.50, and the
weekend featured Jelly Leftwich and
Band.

By 1936, the Ring-tum Phi finally
considered the fall dance news-
worthy enough to give it a page-
wide headline. As usual, the Cotil-
lion Club made the arrangements for
the weekend, whose cost has risen
to $5.50 per student. On the 16th
of October, the Sophomores gave
their dance, followed on the next
day by a football game with Ken-
tucky and a formal dance.

The Cold War

Another thing which I am sure
pleases many people is the wonder-
ful way in which they (I don’t know
who) regulate the temperature of
the dressing room. After coming out
of the pool from the tests which
test how long it would take for
you to drown or some other sadistic
thing like that, one is naturally
tired. How that “cool” air picks one
up again! By the time you get your
towel you have to melt before you
can dry off. It’s amazing how short
a time it takes to get pneumonia.

Then there’s the matter of the
commons food, but as that subject
could not be covered in enough col-
orful detail in the Space here, I
shall have to wait. I hope you can
see now that the little things are
often the biggest in the mental and
normal stability of the students.
Trivial though they may seem to
the outside world, and even VMI,
they must not be taken too lightly.

Challenge to America

If the high standard of American
living is to be maintained, we must
live in the best possible eonditions.
We must not let America decay
from the head. We must turn our
efforts to an all-out fight against
run-down conditions such as these.
Then, and only then can we compete
with success with our rivals on the
higher levels.

Washington and Lee Football, Soccer Successful

By TOM CRENSHAW
Frday Sports Writer

This Friday Coach Lee McLaugh-
lin’s Washington and Lee Generals
take to the road for their first en-
counter on foreign soil. The Gen-
erals will travel to Selinsgrove, Pa.,
to meet formidable Sesquehenna, a |
team, which like W&L, takes fierce
pride in their win-loss record. Un-
til three weeks ago, Susquehanna
had been the proud holder’s of the
nation’s longest undefeated streak
(22 games). They had their string
broken opening day, but since then
they have bounced back strong and
deefated their next two opponents.

Undoubtedly this will be W&L’s
sternest test thus far this season,
and most likely it could be the
toughest of the year. As Coach Wil-
liams so aptly put it, “Gentlemen,
this is a football team.”

 

A record of 24 wins and 1 loss is!
a pretty impressive record for any ee
but it |#

team to carry with them,
shouldn’t frighten any of the Gener- ||

A

als from making the trip; it seems [

they have managed to taste a few
victories in the past three seasons,
31 out of 33 to be more precise.

Defense Problem

Washington and Lee will have to
find a way to bottle up the inside
running of Susquehenna’s Larry
Kerstetter, a fullback, who last
year gained 583 yards and managed
to strike for 74 points. If this were
not enough, Susquehanna offers two
more dandies in Larry Srdman, who
boasts an impressive 575 yards and
46 points to his last year’s credit,
and Don Green, who, while in be-

tween passing, found time to lug the
ball for 527 yards—an average of
7.4 yards per carry.

Not to be denied, however, is the
Generals’ fine running backfield di-
rected by Johnny McDaniel and
featuring Little All American can-

Fate Echols Seen As Bouncer

This being Openings Weekend,
any house in need of a bouncer
for a closed party might try Fate
Echols, the newly-acquired Eagle
tackle. Fate has seen a lot of action
in the Chicago area during the
summertime throwing a few of his
250 lbs. around at various social
functions. According to the socially
prominent Jeff Sheehan, our on-the-
spot North Shore reporter, Fate

Lynchburg Colege Defeats W&L;
Booters Loose Second Straight

W&L’s booters went down to their
second straight one-goal defeat
Tuesday, at the hand of their old
rival Lynchburg College. Close all
the way, the game was undecided
until late in the final quarter when
L.C. made the critical score.

W&L got off to a fast start and
pressed during the entire first quart-
er, but were unable to crack Lynch-
burg’s “tight-back” defense. With
these two fullbacks drawn back, the
Generals’ loop passing game was
totally ineffective around the goal
mouth—especially since the ball was
only seen on rare occasions when a
breeze lifted the dust cloud from the
grassless dust waste of the field. At
one point, play stopped completely
while players searched for the “lost”
ball.

The second quarter was an unin-
spiring display of free kicking by

the halfbacks who sat back and un- ;

intentionally volleyed to one another
for at least two-thirds of the period.

The Generals’ defense actually
played an excellent game, with

Howie Buse leading the pack but
the forward line couldn’t do a thing.
With unfailing inaccuarcy the for-
ward lines of both teams tried to
mount offensive threats, but rarely
reached either end of the field.

The second half was extremely
reminiscent of the second period
except for various catcalls from the
Lynchburg bench and the increasing
pro-Lynchburg hillside fans. The
Lynchburg goal came on a right

Frosh Soccer Team Victor,

Penalty Kick Decides Game

By REN MANNING

Friday Sports Writer
Claude Rodgers booted a penalty
kick untouched into the lower left
corner of the goal in the third
period for the only score of the
day to give the Washington and
Lee Freshmen their second straight

‘| victory of the season against one de-

feat. By defeating Lynchburg, they
squared matters with the team that
had handed them their first game
loss, 2-1.

Throughout the game, the visitors
worked a good offense to their
advantage to keep the freshmen
bottled up in their own territory,
unable even to make an offensive
effort. Lynchburg had every chance
to break the game wide open fre-

 

quently, but key saves by star goalie
Ward Briggs prevented a single
score. The few times W&L got the
ball, they either muffed the chance
to work the ball downfield or blew
an easy goal. Sloppy passing and
dribbling gave the visitors many
gifts and no threat to speak of.

In the second period Lynchburg
was given two golden opportunities
which they succeeded in returning
to the home team. A W&L foul gave
Lynchburg a penalty kick. Briggs
knocked down the attempt in a sen-
sational move to prevent the score
and the freshmen breathed a sigh
of relief. However, during the kick
a man had moved and they were
allowed another kick. Again Briggs

Welcome back to the halls of higher learning! And here we go,
with the 1963/64 series on correct dress and grooming geared to
you—to help you earn extra credits as the well-dressed man-about-

campus.

This season, the big topic is the return to tweed—rugged, textured,
and in a wide variety of patterns. Take tweed into account when
you’re picking out your sport jackets, and for a new suit to wear

on or off-campus, on weekends, or what you will!

RUNNING NECK AND NECK in the sweep-

stakes for tweed sport jackets are race-track
plaids, herringbones and diagonals. Race-track
patterns are found in strong, vigorous color
combinations like gold, amber and blue, while
the biggest thing in herringbone is bold
black-and-white or black-and-gray. Multicolor
diagonals come in heather tones with a muted,
misty effect. Even the ubiquitous blazer is
newly disguised in tweed, with broad—almost
awning—stripes in unusual and interesting
colors. Whatever you choose, your jacket still
sports its classic cut, straight-hanging, with

natural shoulders, center vent
closure.

 

and 3-button

THE CAMELS ARE COMING—This rich, medium brown shade
will blend well with every other color in your wardrobe—so look
for camel color in sport jackets, cardigans, pullovers and zipper
jackets, among other things. You name it—you’ll find it in camel!

STRONG, STURDY CORDUROY is still the mainstay of the
campus wardrobe—especially in the newer, wider-wale weaves.
Sport jackets come equipped with the popular leather patches that
keep you from coming out-at-elbow while adding a smart touch.
Poth jackets and slacks will be in demand in the neutral, natural
tans, while olives are with us still. Or you might try the latest

corduroy—camel, what else?

VARIETY IS THE SPICE OF SLACKS—as long as the variety’s

confined to fabric. Cut remains trim and tapered, pleatless and
with a plain waistband. Real winners are worsteds with a smooth
finish, or wool-and-polyester blends with a flannel finish, Take a
look at both darker and intermediate tones—oxford grays, olives,
dark brown, as well as the middle mixtures—then make your com-
mand decision on the basis of the blend or contrast with your

jackets.

 

RIDING HIGH on campuses throughout the
country is the hi-riser shoe, now available in
smooth leathers like cordovan, as well as
brushed leathers. A good choice for all but the
most formal occasion—or the football field—is
the popular slip-on. The traditional moccasin is
the theme—and its variations are very nearly
unlimited! Grained leather slip-ons are new
for Fall, and watch particularly for grained
leathers in black. Equally smart is the wing-
tip, one of this season’s revivals.

TOP IT OFF WITH TWEEDS, T0G—now that

sport hats are being made of this fabric fa-
vorite! You can have a sport model hat with
pinch crown and narrow brim in a variety of
tweeds, as well as the regulation flat country

 

cap. If you'd rather concentrate on corduroy,

you can find plenty of hats to your taste—usually wide-wale, with
broad band and feather mount. So don’t overlook the multiple pos-
sibilities of the fabric hat for the sporting life!

Next month we'll turn the spotlight on tailored apparel, and give
you The Word on suits, topcoats and town-type accessories to tide

you over. See you then!

Modern Era Lacks Pattern;

Foils Student Of

By ROD COCKSHUTT

As a student of history I find it
revealing from time to time to look
retrospectively into the course of
human affairs to see how the con-
cerns and fears of the past are con-
tinually supplemented or replaced as
time goes by.

For instance, think with me for a
moment about the world situation
approximately a year ago today.
With our eyes and ears guled to
the television, radio, and the news-
papers, we watched and waited an-
xiously as the two greatest powers
in the world moved closer and clos-
er to a showdown which might
easily have led to the destruction
of this planet. Yes, we all remember
the Cuban Crisis.

For the first time really we are
faced with a most vivid example of
what terror there is inherent in our
age. Most of us felt helpless. All
of us were afraid. Hoarding was
common in many of our major cities;
college students left school and re-
turned home; air raid drills and
other civil defense measures were
meticulously practiced.

But the Cuban Crisis passed. And
with shudders of relief we returned
to our normal daily lives, only
temporarily shaken by the magni-
tude of what we had just experienc-
ed.

Today, a little less than a year
later, the climate has _ radically
changed. The Sino-Soviet rift, the
establishment of the “hot line,” the
partial nuclear test ban treaty, in-
creased cultural and commercial
relations between the West and the
Soviet bloc all point to the fact that
our world today is at least a very
transitory one.

Whether we are inclined to in-
terpret the changes in the world sit-
uation as a giant step toward ulti-
mate peace and_ reconciliation
among nations, or merely as a

History

hiatus in the inevitable death strug-
gle between Communism and the
West is of little matter to us here.
Again, history alone can be the final
judge of that.

Nor are we saying that when
crises occur we need not fret be-
cause nearly always they resolve
themselves and “things just seem to
work out fine.” Such a view is
naive and leads only to apathy and
ignorance.

Rather the point we are trying
to make is that the times in which
we live are extremely fluid. Histori-
cal patterns in international politics,
theology, philosophy, the arts, race
relations, and scientific research have
been shattered and there is little,
if anything, we can look upon today
as stable. An era such as this it
seems, must be prone to crisis.
As an individual and as a nation
we must attempt to move with the
times; not helplessly swept up by
the tide, but ever trying as best
we can to guide the course of events
along channels which will be ulti-
mately beneficial to mandkind.
Otherwise, we drown.

Play Teams Our Caliber
Way To Restore Spirit

Dear Sir:

On the front page of the Tuesday
edition, there was a rousing head-
line announcing something to the

effect of “SEMINARY GIRLS STIR
CROWD, TEAM ON TO VICTORY!”

Now maybe the girls from Sem
did stir the crowd and team, but
they sure didn’t have anything to do
with the victory. It is common
knowledge here that school spirit is
a farce. People come to games only
if there is nothing better to do and
even then wouldn’t think of en-
couraging the team for fear of being
considered some sort of gung-ho
fanatic (and they are perfectly
right... they would be).

Everyone knows that the students
usually couldn’t care less about the
team, but has anyone stopped to
ask why? It is true tht spectator
spirit is generated by an intense,
if temporary, hatred of the op-
ponent. How then can anyone be-
come enthused over annihilating
some team that he feels sorry for?
How can anyone with a sense of
humanity and a clear conscience
help but feel a twinge of pity for
the hapless, scurvy ball clubs that
the W&L football machine annually
destroys?

The answer to our dilemma is
this: play teams that at least have
a chance of beating us or even
(Heaven Forbid!) where we might
have some probability of actually
losing! Why not try to get in, for
instance, the Southern Conference?
None of the teams in that organi-
zation are powers, and if we lose

 

more games, we will at least be put-
ting forth a more worthwhile ef-
fort, and what’s more important,
the spectators will be able to cheer
the team on without an overbear-
ing feeling of guilt and foolishness.

name and was firmly established in
this year.
1942

Despite the poor student support
in 1941 and a resulting Dance Board
Deficit of $387.15, not to mention
wartime restrictions, Openings was
held as usual, featuring Bobby
Byrne and the VMI Commanders.
From 1943 to 1946, Openings were
not held.

In 1946, Openings came back to
life with the pre-war type dance.

In October, 1947, only a_ short
time before the scheduled Open-
ings, the Ring-tum Phi ran_ this
headline: BROOKS CANCELS
OPENINGS SET DATE... Emer-
gency Committee Considers Harvey,
Sherwood, Chester. The Dance
Board had received a last minute
telegram from Randy Brooks an-
nouncing his’ cancellation. The
Dance Board finally came through
with Bob Chester’s band; however,
the Openings Dances was late that
year... November 21 and 22.

By 1950, except for the demise of
the Cotillion Club and the substitu-
tion of the concert for the Sopho-
more Prom, the evolution of Open-
ings was complete.

as well, of course, for a chance to
improve their season record.

The up and coming “training
break” will also be better if there
is something to celebrate. Last year.
the Generals beat VPI, but only after
a hard fought first half in which
W&L again started very slowly.

Attendance will hopefully be good

Tight Defense For Victory

proved equal to the task in prevent-
ing a score. This seemed to give
W&L new life as they showed better
ball control before the half ended.

In the third period Claude Rodgers
cashed in on his attempt of a pen-
alty kick and that was the entire
W&L offense as they were able to
tighten up their defense throughout
the rest of the game to preserve the
1-0 victory.

The victory was a big one though,
as Lynchburg College played their
JV team with many varsity play-
ers on it. Defense was the keynote
in the win, with Briggs, Terry Her-
man, Claude Rodgers, and Brad
Shinkle playing top roles. Next

SALUTE: FRED BRIGHT

What's compatible with aeronautical engineering and tele-
phone communications—Fred Bright (B.Aero.E., 1960).
In less than three years, Fred has soared to success in the
southwestern area of Ohio Bell.

Fred’s first assignment consisted of preparing and
presenting a series of courses designed to measure the
technical competence of people who were being evaluated
for promotion. Even though he had no previous experi-
ence in this field, the course material is still being used
without any alterations.

Finestone Wins EC Election
With Small Vote Margin

By CHARLES NEWMAN

The Freshman Class elected Stuart
Finestone Executive Committeeman
Monday night in the Commons by a
vote of 166 to 138, a narrow margin
of 28 votes.

Finestone, a ZBT pledge, was the
Progressive Party candidate. He
defeated Bryant Kendrick, Phi Delt
freshman and University Party can-
didate.

The new EC member is from Nor-
folk where he attended Granby
High School. As a freshman and
sophomore, Finestone was president
of his class. He was elected vice-

Futch Speaks

On GOP Policy
To Republicans

At the Young Republican meeting
last night, Dr. Jefferson Davis Futch
of the W&L History Department
spoke on GOP foreign policy, past
and prospective.

His talk proposed reform of the
party’s foreign policy orientation in
a number of fields. One problem
taken up was co-existence and its
nature as a temporary cold war ex-
pedient or as a permanent state of
international equilibrium, the former
described by the speaker as prefer-
able, since it does not recognize the
current situations as acceptable.

 

U.S. in Popularity Contest?

Another issue raised was the ques-
tion of whether or not the US.
should become the world’s self-
appointed missionary of “democracy”
or leader of a Holy Alliance of
Democracy. A final problem discuss-
ed was America’s reliance upon “a
popularity contest conception of
foreign policy.” Will we lead the
world, the speaker asked, or will
“world opinion” lead us?

Support Allies Regardless

These two points summarize Dr.
Futch’s argument, a main point of
which was that we should support
our allies whether or not they adopt
our form of government—Indo-
China, he noted, was never Thomas
Jefferson’s stamping ground any-
way ,and many peoples abroad could
not handle democracy even if they
acquired it. The means to the de-
sired ends as far as GOP is con-
cerned (with an eye to victory in
1964 or certainly in 1968) is for a
few shake-ups in Washington in
order to arrive at a sounder basis
for our foreign policy.

Honor Student

He was a member of both the Na-
tional Honor Society and the Key
Club, and a varsity letterman, ex-
celling in golf. For three years he
served as Norfolk’s outstanding high
school student and was elected out-
standing student at Granby each
of his four years in high school..

In his senior year Finestone was
elected Outstanding Teenager from
Granby High, and he was also se-
lected as a member of Granby’s
Hall of Fame. He was named the
most valuable student in the four
years he was there.

Mayor's Commission

Finestone also served on the Nor-
folk’s Mayor’s Youth Commission
and as a representative to a na-
tional conference on citizenship in
Washington, D.C.

So far this year at Washington and
Lee Finestone has joined the busi-

Shenandoah
Joins A.L.M.A.

Shenandoah, Washington and Lee
University’s quarterly literary mag-
azine, has become a member of the
Association of Literary Magazines of
America.

The national organization, form-
ed in November 1961, is designed
to increase the usefulness and
prestige of literary magazines in
the United States and Canada.
There are 36 literary magazines

represented in the association,
many of them college and Uni-
versity journals.

Prof. James Boatwright UI, editor
of Shenandoah and instructor in
English at the University, represent-
ed the magazine at the association’s
annual meeting October 11 and 12
in New York City.

The purpose of the Association of
Literary magazines of America is to
combat the concept that literary
magazines are private enterprises for
commercial ends, and to strengthen
the economic conditions and capa-
bilities of the magazines as a group.

Pictures Taken

In Effort To
Promote WGL

More than 800 full-color pictures
were taken of the Washington and
Lee campus, faculty, and students
last week. Prior to last week a rep-
resentative from Guidance Associa-
tes in Pleasantville, N. Y., came to
W&L and took notes for a 12-inch
long-playing record to accompany
these pictures.

The project was originated by Mr.
Frank Parsons, Assistant to Presi-
dent Cole, with the idea of aiding
the Admissions Staff in promoting
W&L to high schools and prep
schools in the country.

Increasing Promotion

Many colleges have been increas-
ing the methods by which they reach
prospective students. One of these
is increased visitation by represen-
tatives of the individual college’s
admission staff. W&L has stepped
this phase of its promotional pro-
cedure in recent years.

Another method is the film-strip
and record, which can be sent out
to secondary schools for use in their
guidance departments. Guidance
Associates, Inc., which has done
film-strips and records for 50 schools
in the past two years including
Princeton, Brown, Cornell, Trinity,
Rutgers, Notre Dame, and the United
States Military Academy, is now
processing a film for W&L.

Editing Now Underway

Out of the 800 pictures exposed,
about 80 to 100 frames will be
chosen. A script for the frames will
be written from the notes made sev-
eral weeks ago. About 225 of these
“kits” will be purchased by the
school, and 25 will be held back to
send to alumni who might promote
the school in their region.

Many high schools and _ prep
schools now have special apparatus
for viewing these film-strips. The
record has tone-signals which tell
the operator when to flip the slide
to the next picture.

Once the film-strip and record are
complete, they will be used to sup-
plement our present promotional
programs, but they are not intended
to replace personal visitation.

f Panel Discussion And Concert

Highlight Weekend’s Activity

By HOWARD EPSTEIN
Tuesday Staff Reporter

The parents of nearly half of W&L’s student body will
get a closer look at campus life this weekend during the Uni-

Weekend.

More than 1,100 guests will begin arriving here Friday

*morning for a weekend designed to
provide them with opportunities to
attend classes, hold individual con-
ferences with faculty members, hear
reports from University and stu-
dent body officers, and visit with
their sons.

Washington and Lee and the 50-
member Parents’ Advisory Council
are co-sponsors of the weekend. The
annual meeting of the Council is
scheduled for Friday afternoon at
2:30 in the Student Union Building.
The chairman is Donald A. Holden
of Newport News, whose son is a
senior at the University.

The weekend officially gets under-
way Friday with registration at
10 am., and ends Saturday night
with a Glee Club concert at 8:30.

Campus Tour Slated

Among the top attractions on Fri-
day’s schedule will be tours of the
campus and Lee Chapel, recently
restored by the Ford Foundation for
$370,000. Visitors will have a chance
to see new exhibits in the Chapel’s
first-floor museum. Also during this
time an open house will be held in
the University’s $1,525,000 science
facilities—in full use for the first
time this year, and at 2:30 the W&L
Freshman Football team will play
Bridgewater College on Wilson Field.

Parents desiring conferences with
their sons’ professors will meet with
faculty members Friday afternoon
and Saturday morning. The confer-
ences, scheduled with the professors
by the students, have been one of
the most popular features of past
parents’ weekends. Parents are also
welcome to attend Friday and Sat-
urday morning classes.

A round of activities—including
faculty panel discussions, a demon-
stration debate and a peek at a play
rehearsal—are planned for the par-
ents’ first night in Lexington.

Panel Discussions

Ten faculty members will partici-
pate in three different panel discus-
sions between 8 and 9 p.m. Friday.
Dr. Jay D. Cook, professor of ac-
counting, Dr .Charles F. Phillips,
Jr., associate professor of economics,
and Prof. John F. DeVogt, instructor
in commerce, will discuss “The Pro-
posed Tax Cut: Its Effect on the
Economy.”

Three members of the English
faculty, Dr. Severn P. C. Duval, Dr.
Sidney M. B. Coulling, and Prof.
James Boatwright, will talk about
“Why Johnny Can’t Write” in an-
other discussion. The third panel
will focus on the topic “The Com-
puter in Action: Master or Slave?”
J. Baine Fox, director of the Uni-
versity’s Computer Center, Maj.
George W. Miller, associate profes-
sor of military science, Dr. J. Thomas
Ratchford, assistant professor of
physics, and Dr. John H. Wise, pro-
fessor of chemistry, will participate
in the discussion centered around
Washington and Lee’s newly
quired IBM 1960 computer.

ac-

Debaters To Perform
A demonstration debate by mem-
bers of the University’s prize-win-
ning debate team will get underway
at 8 p.m. Friday in the auditorium
of Lee Chapel. The student debaters
will argue the topic, “Resolved:
That Thomas Jefferson Would Be
Tried for Treason Today.” Also an
open rehearsal of the forthcoming
Troubadour production of “The Fire-
bugs” by Max Frisch is on tap be-
tween 8 and 9 p.m. Friday night at
the Troubadour Theater.

Question Of Tradition

Should Washington and Lee continue to condone
shoes without socks? . . . ties draped around the shoulders
and no more?...shirt-tails flapping in the breeze?
Should we? Because we are allowing many students of this
university to walk on campus and off in the various states
of undress just described.

In an address to student leaders, Bill Noell used an
analogy from the movie “Hud” which everyone should
remember: an old ranch owner has been forced to herd
his cattle into a giant trench and shoot them because they
all have contracted hoof-and-mouth disease. After the
cattle have been shot, bulldozers begin to fill the giant
grave.

The old man’s grandson says: “That didn’t take
long.” The old man says: “That’s right—it takes a mighty
long time to grow somethin’, but it don’t take long to kill
Ag

 

It has taken a long time to build up our tradition of
conventional dress on this campus. Some students may feel
it isnt a tradition any more—just a rule—and perhaps it
is. But even if it is a rule, we think it is a good one.
Four years ago coats and ties were a definite tradition—
and so, if that tradition has declined to the point of being
a mere rule, that decline has occurred because of the
disinterested attitude of the present student body.

A sure way to allow conventional dress to continue to
rot of the gangrene of apathy is to pay as little attention
to it as we have over the past three years. It is not the
Assimilation Committee, but the students, who must
maintain this tradition. We believe that most students
cherish the tradition of coats and ties, and want to keep
it strong. But just as the Honor System is kept strong by
the reporting of violations, so violations of conventional
dress must be reported in order for the tradition to be
continued.

Perhaps the Assimilation Committee should be given
more teeth; perhaps some of those who have so compla-
cently maligned the tradition of conventional dress should
be given a semester at home to think about it. Perhaps the
unwritten “bounds” of conventional dress (up to 10:30
week nights; up to 1 p.m. Saturdays; no exceptions on
campus at any time) should either be put down in black
and white so the Assimilation Committee would have
something definite to go on—or, these so-called time-
limits should be scrapped altogether, and the tradition
applied at all times day and night.

But surely, something must be done. We can’t allow
this problem to be “‘tabled”—either by the Executive
Committee or by the students.

O’Havra Dissects Soctety
In ‘From the Terrace’

John O’Hara: From the Terrace. (Bantam, $.95).
Reviewed by ROGER PAINE

From the Terrace is the most ambitious novel which John O'Hara
has ever tried to write. It is a book of near-epic proportions, in-
cluding detailed descriptions of over 100 characters, and moving
resolutely through the development of the United States over the
first half of the twentieth century.

Made into an entertaining movie which starred Paul Newman
and Joanne Woodward, From the Terrace as a novel needs editing.
The Bantam paperback is 981 pages of small print, and many of
those pages are not at all important to the development of the plot.
Yet the book is not dull, and from the standpoint of history, soci-
ology, and pure human interest, it comes off as a successful story.

Story of Alfred Eaton

The story centers around Alfred Eaton, a young man who grows
up in Port Johnson, Pennsylvania, not far from Gibbsville (the
scene of Ten North Frederick and O’Hara’s first novel, Appointment
at Samarra), Alfred’s father owns the local steel mill, which is the
center of Port Johnson’s economy. From the Terrace is Alfred’s
story, in that it describes the moment of his birth, his maturation,
his prep school and college days, the first sallies he makes into the
business world, all of his sexual relations, and his final collapse.

Typically O’Hara is the sexual description in the novel; as the
“Saturday Review” said: “O’Hara deals with sexual matters not
by any process of delicate allusion, but by the adducing of precise
physiological details.” Yet, the private lives of all Terrace’s charac-
ters are the major concern of the story, and O’Hara’s detailed des-
criptions of their sexual wants and fulfillments help to make the
characters more distinct.

Packed With Detail

A major criticism of the novel has been that it is too long. It is
packed with detail, to be sure, but O’Hara “is never stupidly un-
selective in his handling of facts; he makes them count,” according to
the “Saturday Review.” I agree with this. When O’Hara began col-
lecting material for the novel, he was more meticulous than one
would think possible. He spent six years thinking about his story and
gathering information: he talked to bankers, lawyers, Navy _men,
flyers, and he wrote dozens of letters to verify the smallest detail. He
received answers from scores of officials about planes in World War
I, the inner workings of Wall Street, and the precise wording on a
U.S. Navy death notice.

Alfred Eaton, coming from a well-to-do family, enters the world
of the moneyed. The problem of money is never in the forefront for
any of the major characters. O’Hara gives the reader a personalized
account in the in’s and out’s of Long Island society, small-town
society, politicos in Washington, D, C. and the elite of California.

Novel Has Broad Scope

Alfred lives a varied life, participates in many different things,
goes through two wives and a mistress, a job with a Wall Street
bank, a stint as Under Secretary of the Navy, O’Hara has the au-
thority to describe the social nuances of the very rich as no other
author of recent times has. His dialogue throughout the novel is
superb. His characterization, especially among many of the secondary

characters, is excellent.

Verse by James Ledbetter

 

Three Words an

e

She lit a cigarette and made the morning seem,

Eyes low, curtains drawn, nothing less than act of
treason.

“You always search for all, for death,” she said; “I never
knew

That something so diseased could be your aim.” Watch-
ing

Skin grow olive under flame, I knew what morning
brings

When honest eyes give thoughts of bed. “No,” she said,

Putting fingers to my lips, and sadly thought

How hard to say, you know that silence brings reward

But not to leave the thing unsaid—and so instead

She looked and said with eyes, don’t you know

I live to feel a harness eased,

Smell dead grass in old courtyards, feel nerves flutter

Under lack of reason,

Hear a dying bird, or know a change of season?

Black Snakes

I too went and heard the man say words;

People cried as if by pressed buttons,

And I was left with another kind of grief. Then

Told to see the mill, I got its keeper to show me

Where before a family feud had sent his father’s side
downstream

Brought half the country round, now a mild decay.

White-washed (twenty years ago) rooms empty,

Dust in which the black snakes (kept

to eat the rats) crept peeling,

The smell of a cellar. The stone, and then

The broken race, atonic, the whole place unpronounced

Death and the old man talking.

Feeling vaguely sick and like another lovely cipher

(Musty cider with pinhead bubbles), I felt

The path away and waning, remarked the stone foun-
dation.

Wondering what they wanted me to think. Lady

da Black Snake

After seeking renaissance and atonement,
Sitting and eating your bitter tears of honey,
Still I see the man at the lonely table
Trying to take from a cigarette

What it cannot give.

A Minor Vanity

Now we grow tired of words,

Our bodies break like flood-tides
Crushing sediment and clay,
Mirrows break, and lungs pull in
To exorcise the winter’s sin,
Achieve the day, and leave the hour
Unbeconable, unmitigated.

Loves born in past months sing
Framed in their memories of blue ice,
Exchanged, repaid,

For habits dead and dying. You
Think bad of me; forgive

A minor vanity,

Unnatural in our cold month,

That loves to twist meaning.

Three Words

Modern Man sits in chloroform coolness

Striking images in walls of prismatic mirror.
The mind is dissected with clockwork precision.
Doors close. No words are needed. Indeed,

Until the clever instruments are packed away
One by one in pads and folds of cotton,

Until the castration is effected, the tuned
Attitudes captured, translated into every tongue,
Transmuted, and all the surgeons faceless,

One by one, lie down in each his separate space
Only three words will be possible. Only three,
And if you will come closer, incline your ear to mine,
Listen now, I will tell them to you.

 

Dance Board Offers

‘Lousy’ Performers

Say Student Hold-Outs On Dance Plans

Last week a letter from the Dance

Board was passed out at all the
Fraternity houses on campus, and
the lead question was “What does
a Dance Plan Have to Offer You?”
Since we were very interested to
know we read the letter carefully,
and then added it to the rest of the
material accumulated from official
and unofficial sources begging every-
body to buy a Dance Plan before
the social structure of the University
fell down about our ears. Unfor-
tunately ,we were still negatively
impressed with what a Dance Plan
had to offer us.

Entertainment Poor

It is well to point out at first that
the main reason we have not, and
will not buy a Dance Plan is for the
simple reason that we believe the
entertainment is lousy. Performers,
just like books or movies, are ex-
tremely controversial, and, therefore
a Dance Plan purchase on this basis
is strictly individual. However, we
feel that the Dance Board has been
negligent in not only the entertain-
ment they have contracted but the
lack of any kind of continuity in
the entertainment, and the weak
foundation of their appeal to the stu-
dent body to bail them out of hot
water.

When we received the summer
letter of the Dance Board, we were
interested in not only the entertain-
ment that was definite, but the pro-
posed entertainment that was still
tentative. In this way we might be
able to discern some general trend in
the type, or types, of entertainment
that the Dance Board was interested

in. We discovered no real trend, ex-
cept perhaps one toward chaos
(which they prefer to call diversity),
and what was there was not very
impressive. It was immediately evi-
dent to both of us that we would
rather run the cross-country course
(and for us this would be extremely
unfavorable) than sit through more
than 30 minutes of Stan-the-Man
Rubin’s “Big” Ochestra and Dakota
Staton (especially together).

Ray Charles

In the latest Dance Board epistle
we were not surprised to find that
they were interested in Ray Charles.
Who isn’t? But we were surprised
to find that they actually thought
they could get him here. This would
call for a complicated arrangement
with other schools in this area to
hire him on successive nights—so
complex an arrangement that it de-
fies description, but, more power to
them. If Ray Charles did come, we
would gladly pay the $8.50 at the
door, and feel we were realizing a
saving of $21.50.

Responsibility With Board

What is more galling than anything
else, however, is the Dance Board’s
approach to student body support.
They come to us and say, “if you
give us $30 we will try and get some
good bands down here.” They make
it clear that the burden of respon-
sibility rests with us. In the past it
has been the Dance Board’s res-
ponsibility to give the student body
a definite idea of what type of en-
tertainment they will get. It is not
our responsibility to blindly follow
wherever they wish to lead. They

are selling a product, not collecting
for charity. And, essentially, if the
Dance Plans do not sell well, it is
not because of the $5 hike in cost,
but because the product is not worth
$30. It certainly is not worth it to
us.

However, we hope it is clear that
we have supported the Dance Board
in the past, and we look forward to
doing so in the future, but we cannot
support them at this time. We owe
them no obligation—but they defi-
nitely have an obligation to the stu-
dent body. We feel that the “pres-
tige of Washington and Lee’s social
life” depends more on their planning
than on our wildly spending our
money for something we’re not sure
we'll get, and not even sure we want
it.

Need a Good Product

The Dance Board reminds us that
“You get what you pay for and pay
for what you get.” We feel that if

Coun Sywire:

By A. L. BROCKENBROUGH

Wednesday, October 16

Today I strolled across the longest
concrete footbridge in the world, and
wondered why it was. Perhaps no
other civilization has thought about
building such a long bridge out of
concrete. At the end of the bridge,
and to the right, was a sophomore
gym class in session. Sprawled out
in a long line, the students were

driving golf balls down the field
which is adjacent to the football
field.

Drawing a little closer, I discov-
ered the exact procedure which was
being followed by the class. Each
student had three golf balls. After
hitting these balls, each golfer would
wait until the other golfers had
taken their turns. And then, in
something which is reminiscent of
the Oklahoma land rush, the long
line of students, dressed in street
clothes, charged down the field to
retrive not one—not two—but three
golf balls.

The process was then repeated.
I can’t deny that there is some value
to hitting a golf ball, but consider-
ing the other parts of the game
which are involved, I can’t see how
this process will enable many of the
students to play a respectable round
of golf on the Lexington Country
Club course, which they have to
do after nothing more than the ex-
ercise I have just described.

Thursday, October 17

The day before Openings—but
there doesn’t seem to be much en-
thusiasm. Could it be that since
Openings will be the fourth party
weekend in a row, students can’t
quite “get up” for the game?

Friday, October 18

It’s a disappointing sign of the
times—in the Friday Edition of the
paper, the list of houseparties over
the weekend indicated that six par-
ties were closed. These six parties
involve nine of the eighteen frater-
nities on campus. Two or three years
ago, there was no such thing as a
closed party at W&L, except in the
instances of the traditional Christmas
and spring parties.

The fact that no parties were
closed in those days gave W&L on
a party weekend the spirit of hospi-
tality. Anybody could go anywhere;
no one was barred at any door. Now,
guests from other schools as well
as our own students are turned
away by irresolute bouncers. The
reason: fraternities are hiring com-
bos which require an investment of
$500.00 or more for a mere four
hours of entertainment. Understand-
ably, they want to have to cope only

Pace Reviews
Antonioni Films

As Excellent

By TOM PACE

Recently the film “L’Avventura,”
by Michelangelo Antonioni, was se-
lected in a polling of seventy inter-
national critics as the second best
movie of all time. Even more re-
cently Antonioni’s second major ef-
fort, “La Notte,” received several
prizes as the best film of 1962.
It has occurred to me that it might
better serve my time if I were to
explain to you what makes a film
seem great to me and why the cine-
ma is the medium of the director.

Antonioni has produced in the last
four years a trilogoy which has pre-
sented to his audiences the primary
problem that confronts his own per-
son, and that problem’s resolution.
He strips this problem bare; he sets
it in an intellectual wealthy class
which is concerned with nothing
other than finding something worth
the task of living.

His first step, and by far the
finest film of the three, “L’Avven-
tura,” assumes that wealth, re-
ligion, position, etec., don’t give
man a real fulfillment. He does, in
fact, assume that the only thing
that might is a relationship of
meaning between two people. In
this first film he shows a man and

Big, Fast Susquehanna Snaps Generals’ Win Skein, 31-0

Potent Susquehanna rolled up 383
yards rushing, and used four differ-
ent backs to score Saturday in
their 31-0 rout of W&L, who was
previously undefeated.

The Generals were the victims of
a team so powerful that Susque-
hanna fullback Larry Kerstetter was
named to the Associated Press’s All-
Pennsylvania team last year along
with the best from Pitt and Penn
State.

It was only the second defeat for
W&L in its last 32 games.

Susquehanna scored in every per-
iod on runs of two yards by Kerstet-
ter, 11 yards by halfback John Vig-

 

none, four yards by halfback Larry
E.rdman and 42 yards by reserve
quaterback Sam Metzger.

Starting quarterback Don Green
added five more points by running
two conversions and kicking an-
other.

W&L mounted its only serious
threat in the fourth quarter by driv-
ing from its own 26 to the Sus-
quehanna one where it gave up the
balls on downs. They trailed 16-0 at
the half.

Depth-strong, Susquehanna beat
the Five Star Generals at its own
game. Platooning superbly against

the W&L blue and red units, Sus-
quehanna stopped them with only 84
yards on the ground and showed
that even with a very good day,
W&L would have come out on the
short end of the score.

This was the first time a W&L
team has been shut out since 1959.

Susquehanna’s initial score came
when they recovered a loose for-
ward lateral after a screen pass put
the Generals deep into enemy terri-
tory.

After a 40-yard jaunt by their
starting scatback, Vignone ran over
from the 11 for the score. When

 

this starting scatback, who was in-
jured, was replaced by Erdman,
Susquehanna’s backfield averaged
almost 200 pounds, and showed ex-
cellent speed. Their line averaged
nearly 220 pounds and the Generals’
guards knew it.

W&L halfback Stu Yoffe with
only 20 yards in 11 carries and Hen-
ry Sackett with only 19 yards in 9
carries were the victims of the
moose-like Susquehanna line.

Yoffe caught two passes for 52
yards. Johnny MacDaniel was the
leading Genertals’ rusher with 36
yards in four attempts.

Hampden-Sydney is next on the
list for the Generals.

Light Brigade In Initial Win, 21-0,
Over AMA On Kendrick’s Passes

By DAVID SHUFFLEBARGER

Cross-Country Team Bows, 21-34,
To Old Dominion; O’Connor Stars

Talented Old Dominion College, with the advantage of
its own track, ended W&L’s bid for an undefeated cross-
country season Friday by stopping the Generals, 21-34.

Riff O’connor finished five seconds behind the first O.D.C.
runner, with freshman Bill Wildrick and co-captain Andy Kil-
patrick second and third men for W&L respectively. Charlie

 

 

show.

The Brigadiers now stand with a
1-2 ledger while AMA is winless in
four starts. The Augusta team was
the same one, except for a powerful
205-pound fullback, that bumped off
W&L, 19-6, last year.

A defensive battle dominated by
the Light Brigade took place in the
scoreless first half. Stellar line play
kept the Augusta team from getting
anywhere near the W&L goal.

Coach Dana Swan’s charges rallied
in the third quarter with a couple
of scores on long bombs by Bryant
Kendrick. First the ace quarterback
tossed a wobbly pass deep towards
the far side of the field. Hendrick-
son raced from his left end spot
straight downfield with a slant to-
wards the middle, grabbed the ball
from two defenders, cut to his right
and scored after a short jaunt. After
two penalties the extra point was
run from 4% yard out.

Later in the period Kendrick
dropped back, looked downfield,
then fired to his right to the near
side of the gridiron to Johnny Gra-
ham on a screen pass. Graham, with
a host of blockers, tight-roped the
sideline for the score.

SPORTS

SHUFFLIN’ ALONG

By DAVID SHUFFLEBARGER

Well, there goes another football victory streak down the
drain, but may I suggest that although they lost the game, the
men on the football team have no reason to lose any of their
pride.

In Susquehanna, the Generals faced a team that the top
national sports magazine predicted would naturally fall into the
number two small college spot behind Wittenberg. When a
small, non-subsidized college like W&L attempts to match
brawn and skill that can be brought to Susquehanna, only a
mis-match can result.

Although this was a pretty good Susquehanna team, it
was an outstanding Washington and Lee team despite the fact
that they didn’t play their best ball. Now let your thoughts
drift to next year when graduation steals the whole blue team
offense. Susquehanna won’t have slipped much since their
money is pretty consistent, and W&L may be very glad that it
has only a two-year schedule with the Susquehanna eleven.

This is not saying that we should regret ever schedueling
the Susquehanna team, for I think it was a very good thing.
It shows that W&L is not afraid to play the best around and
can give them a good run for their money any day of the week.
However, it seems to me that a policy of competing with only
non-subsidized and lightly-subsidized teams might be very
profitable to W&L football.

The main reason we joined the C.A.C. was to get in a
league where we could enjoy good non-subsidized competition.

And if we therefore favor those teams that play for the
sport of the game, then why don’t we schedule just those teams
that don’t subsidize, with the possible exception of Randolph-
Macon and Hampden-Sydney which are old rivals on the
schedule and subsidize ever so lightly.

Agreed there aren’t that many non-subsidized teams in the
nation, but I don’t think it would be too hard to get a schedule
that would prove very interesting without creating any lopsided
contests.

SHORT SHUFFLES—Frank Parsons tells us that con-
trary to popular belief Upsala is not the Green Bay Packers
second unit. Upsala, which upended Susquehanna, 21-0,
early in the season to break a 22-game win skein, was the last
team to beat the Susquehanna men before the streak started.
They capitalized on seven fumbles and three interceptions to
play their nemsis role to the hilt.

Congratulations to Dana Swan’s frosh on their first tri-
umph, a rousing 21-0 win. The newly-formed band will be
on hand for this week’s game against the Bridgewater J.V.’s.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Antonioni Explores Love As Key

To Existence In

(Continued from page 2)

woman hoping, searching, trying
fer a complete communication with
one another. He beautifully, but
painfully asserts that such com-
munication, or a real love is im-
possible ;that the highest feeling
one may have for another is true,
selfless, and personal pity.

His second film begins with this
fact established. The man and wo-
man have not realized a relation-
ship based on love. He allows them
both to try again, with someone
new, only to bring them together at
the finish, the man forcing the wo-
man to submit to his sexual wants,
with her resisting until she too ad-
mits her own desires.

The third film is named “L’Eclise”
(The Eclipse) and is a great disap-
pointment cinematically. Nonetheless
it does present Antonioni’s resolu-
tion to the problem. It begins with
a man and woman breaking off an
affair. Symbolically, this man and
woman are the same that were to-
gether at the end of “La Notte,” the
second step. The woman is the per-
son who is most dissatisfied. She
goes out to look for something new,
something different, something that
will give her fulfillment. She fails
in her attempt and grabs hold of
a man she meets while failing.

At first they seem happy. Yet
we soon discover that she is grow-
ing weary of him, that he too, does
not consider her first among his
many concerns. But then he, An-
tonioni, gives his answer. With a
shrug of the woman’s shoulders,
we are told simply, “What else is
there?” The unanswered question
is its own answer.

Antonioni has slowly, artistically
presented a theme of major signifi-
cance. And what is more important
he has done so cinematically. His
technical talents are unquestionable.

 

| evokes the precise atmosphere nec-

Three Films

He composes each scene carefully,

essary, and uses and guides actors
who are extremely adaptable to his
thematic intent. His on fault is, I
think, his failure to use the camera
more. It is a tool of much potential
but Antonioni seems to shy away
from taking advantage of it. Per-
haps he felt that his subjects re-
quired little motion of camera, but
if so this only implies that his story
is less suited to the medium which
he has chosen than it should have
been.

Horner teamed with veteran Bruce

W&L exhibited its usual running

passes to smooth the offense.

In the second half the booters
rallied with four goals, one each by
Jimmy Mell, Henry, Steve Hibbard,
and Praben Berthelsen.

Ironically, Coach Joe Lyles pre-
dicted the score. He used his pla-

At midnight Saturday when Lloyd

was still a sizeable crowd in Dore-

freshman reaction to the dance was
one I overheard: “Y’know, this isn’t
as bad as everybody said it was go-
ing to be.” The dance was a reason-
able success; the Lloyd Price band
was excellent.

‘From The Tarrace’ Criticized For Lack Of Feeling

(Continued from page 2)

Many of the very rich and very
powerful men of the past century
parade across the pages of From the
Terrace. To go once again to the
“Saturday Review”: “Fiction offers
no more carefully documented ac-

count of American life in the first} -

half of the twentieth century than
From the Terrace. The operations
of a private New York bank, the
number of suicides in the depression
and the intrigues of wartime Wash-
ington are part and parcel of the
novel.”

Novel Fails As Tragedy

Perhaps the novel’s main fault is
that it is billed as a tragedy. Alfred
Eaton is not, however, a very big
man at any point in the story; and,
his decline is so carefully outlined
in the last 200 pages of the novel
that we can see the end in sight long
before we get there. If O’Hara’s
tragedy does not come off, it is part-
ly because Alfred did not have very
far to fall, and partly because we
do not really know him, even after

Switzerland to her specifications, which are 20% wool and 80% cotton. Her reasoning is interesting. She wanted

Troubadours To Present
‘Firebug’ By Max Frisch

By C. C. FLIPPEN
The Firebugs by Max

Frisch, forthing presentation
of the Troubadour Theater,
is a drama which departs from
the usual attempts to depict
realism on the stage.

It stresses rather “open theatrical-
ity.”

“This and the fact that it is one
of the better recent plays is why
we have chosen to produce it this
year,” Dr. Cecil Jones, director of
the production, said.

“Open theatricality” is a stage
technique which emphasizes the
conventions of the theatre rather

 

Freshmen Receive 77 ‘U’s’
For First Grading Period

For a three-day period ending
yesterday, anxious freshmen visited
the offices of their respective ad-
visors to find out and discus the
results of four weeks work as
represented by the “S and U” re-
ports.

Unlike the mid-term grades, the
unsatisfactory reports are not sent
to the student’s home. They serve
only to show the unfortunate fresh-
man who receives notice cf unsatis-
factory work his hazardous schol-
astic situation.

The unsatisfactory reports this
October differ significantly from
those reports given in previous years
in that D grades no longer consti-
tute an unsatisfactory notice. Only
the grades of F and F-plus do the
professors send in as U’s.

One hundred and seven students
receive a total of one hundred and
forty-two unsatisfactory grades with
the following distribution: 77 stu-
dents with 1 unsatisfactory grade;
26 students with 2 unsatisfactory
grades; 3 students with 3 unsatis-
factory grades; and 1 dolt with four
unsatisfactory grades.

 

Leadership Society Names
9 To Steering Committee

The ODK-sponsored leadership
meeting which was held earlier this

dent Bill Burke.

ciety. The Society is composed of

than attempting to picture things
realistically.

“It represents a growing interest
in viewpoint as opposed to the pho-
tographic type staging,” Dr. Jones
said.

This idea goes back many years.
Some critics realized long ago that
the cinema could reproduce realism
far better than the stage. Why not
leave realism to the motion picture
and let the theatre concentrate on
what it could do best?

Today there is a growing interest
in this game. The Theatre of the
Absurd represents one phase. Ed-
ward Albee also attempts it to a
degree.

“There is another group in Ger-
man yand Switzerland which is at-
tempting to follow the similar style
of Bertolt Brecht’s epic theatre. Of
this group Frisch is the best,” Dr.
Jones said.

There are a number of techniques
in The Firebugs which illustrate this
style.

For one there is the use of a
chorus of firemen which represents
a particular point of view.

“The character drawing, which is
akin to Ionesco’s in his full length
dramas, also represents this style.
Here we get individualized charac-
ters—people in whom we can be-
lieve, but who nevertheless repre-
sent a wider range of people,” Jones
said.

There is also the use of a cimul-
taneous setting. The attic and liv-
in room settings exist side by side.

Night and day is indicated by
lowering a crescent moon in and
out.

There are occasionally elements on
stage which are not in a particlar
secent.

“Out of this you get ashow which
is a type of fantasy— a parable
play as Brecht called it,’ Da. Jones
said.

“The play involves slapstick, but
always in sight is its satiric pur-
pose—correcting what Frisch thinks
is a major problem.”

The Firebugs is also an allegorical
type. Biedermann and his wife rep-
resent moral cowardice—the apathy
to evil of the upper middle class.

The two firebugs are variant forms
of evil. One is brutal, the other
insidious. The Ph.D. is the intellect
who feels all problems are to be
studied abstractly.

Authority is represented by the
police who are to a degree helpless
to oppose it until it happens. “Even-
tually it happens on such a big scale
that they can’t handle it,” Dr. Jones
said.

Many have seen in the play a
warning against the modern danger
of Communism. The Trougs, how-
ever, are producing it without com-
ment on any particular situation,
but rather as a basic viewpoint about
the forces of evil and destruction.

The Firebugs was written in 1958
and produced last season off- Broad-
way.

 

Glee Club

Performs Sat.
BY Gene Hatfield

Something new will have
been added when the W&L
Glee Club, under the direc-
tion of Mr. Robert Stewart,
presents its first concert of

the season tomorrow night at
8:30 in Doremus Gymnasium.

Dorcas Campbell, Miss Virginia
of 1963, will join the glee club in
entertaining what is hoped to be a
capacity crowd of parents, students,
faculty and townspeople.

Miss Campbell will join baritone
John Baker in singing the music
from the Bradway hit, West Side
Story. Such popular numbers as
“Maria” and “Tonight” will be in-
cluded in this section of the pro-
gram.

Among Miss Campbell’s previous
performances are appearances on
the nationally televised Voice of
Firestone and with the Chicago
symphony. She is a native of Rock-
bridge County and is said to bear a
striking resemblance to Mrs. John
F. Kennedy

The program for the concert is
widely varied ranging from folk
songs to a selection from the Gloria
Mass in Latin by Vivaldi. Baritone
Bill Supon will sing the lead on
the Vivaldo selection.

Bass Phil Booth will solo on “Ten
Thousand Miles Away,” a sea shanty.
Baker will also see service as the
soloist on “This Ol’ Hammer,” a
negro work song about the legen-
dary John Henry. Guitarist Frank
Wakefield will accompany Baker on
this number.

Another special feature of the pro-
gram will be the performance of a
barber shop quartet consisting of
Randy Lee, Randy Williams, Jon
Neegaard and Scott Lavey. The
group will sing a medley of num-
bers from the turn of the century.

Selections by Bach and Handel as
well as the old favorites will be in-
cluded in the two hour program.
It is hoped there will be a favorite
for everyone in a performance of
such widely varied nature.

Students Ask For Better Entertainment

By SYD LEWIS
Executive Editor
In recent weeks much con-
troversy has arisen over the
Dance Board and Washington
and Lee’s big party weekends.
To try to bring student opinion

into the open, the Ring-tum

Phi has taken a sample survey of

students, trying to include sample

opinions from all fraternities, all

classes, and non-fraternity men.
Openings

The most prevelent question at the
moment is the quality of last week’s
entertainment. Of the people polled,
only 15 per cent thought the at-
tractions in the aggregate were
good, while 56 per cent thought the
entertainment was fair. Twenty-two
per cent of the participants thought
the dance and concert were poor.
(The percentages will not always
add up to 100 per cent because in
some cases students had no opin-
ions).

Many students seemed to dislike
the formal attire at the dance;
however, 41.5 per cent attended. In
an effort to ascertain what circum-
stances would induce a_ larger
crowd, the students who did not
attend were asked: 1) if they would
have attended an informal dance

 

and 2) if they attended a for-
mal dance if drinks of an alcoholic
nature were served. Some 62.5 per
cent said they wiuld attend an in-
formal dance and an overwhelming
majority of 80.5 per cent said they
would attend a formal dance if
drinks were served.

Future Plans

During the sale of Dance Plans
the Dance Board made several an-
nouncements of tentative entertain-
ment for the rest of the year. Only
31.7 per cent of those polled thought
that the plans were good while 29.2
per cent thought future engage-
ments were bad and 34.1 per cent
thought that tentative entertainment
was merely fair. These statistics
seem to confirm the feeling that
there isn’t the enthusiasm for the
performers which should be present.
To determine who students did want,
those polled were asked who they
would like to see most at a concert
or dance. Ray Charles was the fore-
runner, followed by Peter Paul and
Mary, and James Brown. Then there
were several such others as Al Hurt,
Joan Baez, Barbara Streisand, Dave
Brubeck, who received a _ stronge
vote. As to the type of performers
wanted, 87.5 per cent said varied
entertainment was best while 7.3
per cent liked only rock and roll
and 5 per cent only folk music.

 

Finally, all those questioned were
asked how they thought the dance
board could be improved. Answers
were varied with most students
saying the Dance Board was doing
the best it could( though one pollee
thought the Dance Board ought to
be disbanded.) More definite con-
tracts, the signing of contracts be-
fore the school year, entertainment
other than singers, and less dances
were some of the constructive sug-
gestions offered. Although most
students expressed praise for ob-
taining Ray Charles, some thought
that $5,000 was too much to offer
everyone.

Although there were no uniform
suggestions submitted by the stu-
dents it seemed that everyone
thought that something must be done
to improve the party weekends. As
far as who to get there were varied
opinions; however, on one subject,
the dances, nearly everyone felt they
were inadequate. Of those who said
they attended, 40 per cent mentioned
that they remained less than an hour.
This probably indicates that the first
step to gain student enthusiasm for
school sponsored affairs would be
an improvement in the quality of
dances—possibly by making them
informal or by serving drinks at
dances. A possibility might be to
combine the traditional cocktail
party with the dance.

 

EC Appoints

Commutteemen

By SHANNON JUNG
Friday News Editor

The Executive Committee an-
nounced the appointment of four
new student body committeemen,
including three freshmen, and one
law school students.

This represents the first time
freshmen have been appointed to the
Cold Check and Student Library
Committees It is only the second
year that a freshman has been in-
cluded on the Assimilation Commit-
tee.

Bill Hartman, Sig Ep from Hono-
lulu, Hawaii, was appointed to be
the first freshman member of the
Cold Check Committee. Hartman
has also been selected to serve in
the Dance Board Advisory Com-
mittee. He was treasurer of his sen-
ior class and played varsity foot-
ball and track.

John Graham, a Delt pledge from
Richmond, Virginia, has been select-
ed to be the first freshman mernber
of the Student Library Committee.
Graham, who was vice-president of
Douglas Freeman High School, is
the holder of a Baker Scholarship
and plays freshman football.

Bryant Kendrick, Phi Delt from
Greenville South Carolina, has been
selected freshman representative to
the Assimilation Committee. Ken-
drick served as President of his
high school, captain of his high
schoo] track and football teams, and
was a member of the National
Honor Society. He ran for the office
of freshman EC, losing by a small
margin. He has also been elected
one of the tri-captains of the fresh-
man football team.

Ray Vizethannn, freshman law
student from Richwood, New Jersey,
has been appointed to the Assimila-
tion Committee. He is president of
his freshman law class.

The Executive Committee stressed
that the new freshman committee
appointments were made to broad-
en the scope of student representa-
tion on the various committees.

Debaters To Argue

Jefferson’s Theories

The applicability of Thomas Jef-
ferson’s ideas to modern America
will be argued by Washington and
Lee’s championship debate team in
Lee Chapel at 8 tonight.

The topic “Resolved: That Thomas
Jefferson would be tried for trea-
son today” will be debated in an
exhibition which will mark the last
time Bill Noell and Al Eckes will
oppose eath other in a match.

The debate will be presented ia
the British style, which allows the
participants to deride each other and
introduce an element of humor into
the argument. The question to be
debated is whether Jefferson's ideas
are still valid in the light of 20th
century politics, culture, philoso-
phy, economies, and literature.

In the debate tonight there will
be an attempt to hold Jefferson lit-
erally to his statements, according
to one of the four debaters. In-
stead, the object will be to examine
the framework to which he pinned
his ideas.

Debating the affirmative will be
Mike Hayslip and Bill Noe!l, and
opposing them will be Jay Clark
and Al Eckes. Noell and Eckes
composed the W&L team which ad-
vaneed to the national champion-
ship tournament last year. Clark,
a member of one of Washington
and Lee’s former Virginia champion
teams, is captain of the debate
team this year. Hayslip is a sopho-
more who won the award as W&L’s
Outstanding Freshman debater Jast
year.

Last year the same team, with
the exception of Hayslip, staged an
exhibition debate for Parents’
Weekend on the subject, “Resolvea:
That the South should have won
the Civil War.” This subject was
also handled in a humorous manner.
The British debating style employed
in these exhibitions is a free-wheel-
ing, non-classical exchange in which
the debaters must depend heavily
on eloquence, rather than carefully
constructed arguments.

 

Notices

All freshmen affiliated with a fra-
ternity are reminded that they are
to eat at their fraternity houses to-
night. All non-fraternity freshmen
will eat in the private dining room
in Evans Dining Hall.

Virginia Leading State
In ’63 Enrollment Totals

A total of 1,265 students from 42
states, the District of Columbia and
eight foreign countries are enrolled
at Washington and Lee University
this fall.

This year’s official enrollment is
25 higher than the 1962 total of
1,231, according to E. H. Howard,
University Registrar.

The University registered 1,186
students in September of 1961.

Virginia again leads the states in
representation with 272 students.
Maryland has the second highest en-
rollment with 90 and New Jersey
and New York each have 71. For-
eign countries represented in this
year’s student body include Argen-
tina , Denmark, Germany, _§Italy,
Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Sweden and
the Virgin Islands.

Washington and Lee’s current
freshman class numbers 340 as com-
pared with last year’s 334. This fall,
there are 282 sophomores, 232 jun-
iors and 240 seniors.

In the School of Law, Dean
Charles P. Light reports an en-
rollment of 156. The Law School
total includes 62 new men, 51 sec-
ond year students and 42 seniors.
There were 142 law students last
year.

Washington and Lee’s enrollment
climbed above 1,200 in the late 1940’s
with an influx of World War II vet-
erans. During the 1950’s, the Uni-
versity’s enrollment hovered around
the 1,100 mark.

*and Lee life as well as to entertain

them.

Weekend activities commence with
the registration of parents this morn-
ing, 10 to 12 am., in Washington
Hall, and will end Saturday evening
with performances by the W&L
Glee Club, John Graham Brass
Choir, and Miss Dorcas Campbell in
Doremus Gymnasium.

Following registration this morn-
ing, parents met with advisors and
professors at pre-arranged hours
of appointment. The appointments
were from 2 to 4:30 p.m., and will
continue tomorrow morning from 9
to 11.

The annual meeting of the Parents’
Advisory Council was held this af-
ternoon in the Student Union Build-
ing.

Guided tours of Lee Chapel began
at 3:30 this afternoon and included
the new basement museum. At the
same time, the University’s science
facilities were open to the inspec-
tion of parents and students. The
Lee Chapel tours ended at 4:30, but
the Chapel will remain open during
its normal hours tomorrow, and
special hours of 9:30 to 11 a.m. on
Sunday.

While the afternoon campus tours
were in progress, the freshmen foot-
ball team played Bridgewater Col-
lege’s team on Wilson Field.

This evening several rounds of
unique entertainment will be pro-
vided for the parents. From 8 until
9 p.m. there will be faculty discus-
sions on “The Proposed Tax Cut:
Its effect on the Economy,” “Why
Johnny Can’t write,” and “The Com-
puter in Action: Master or Slave?”
At the same time in Lee Chapel
a crack team of student debaters
will argue the question, “Resolved:
That Thomas Jefferson Would Be
Tried for Treason Today.”

Following the debate and discus-
sions ending at 9 p.m., President and
Mrs. Fred C. Cole will host a re-
ception for parents and students in
Evans Dining Hall.

The major attraction for Satur-
day morning is “Reports to Parents”
at 11 am., although there will be
further tours earlier in the morn-
ing. The reports consist of speeches
from the president of the student
body, the deans of all schools and
the dean of students, the director
of admissions, and the president of
the University.

Following the reports the parents
will be served a buffet luncheon in
Evans Dining Hall from 12 to 1:45
p.m.

Ending the activities of Friday and
Saturday will be the Glee Club
Concert at 8:30 p.m. in the gym.

 

 

UCA To Be Sponsor Sieg Reception

Honoring New

By REN MANNING

The University Christian Associa-
tion will sponsor an informal re-
ception for W&L’s three foreign
students Monday night from 7:30
to 8:30 in duPont Auditorium.

The three students, Giancarlo
Marchetti, from Rome Italy; Preben
Berthelsen from Aalborg, Denmark;
and Anders Henricsson from Stock-
holm Sweden; will each speak for
a few minutes chiefly to introduce
themselves and their countries. Re-
freshments and informal conver-
sation will follow their addresses.

“We hope to provide an oppor-
tunity for students and faculty to
meet and talk with our foreign
students,” said Rod Cockshutt, UCA
president.

This year the students from
abroad are trying out a new type
of housing arrangement. In_ the
past, foreign students have lived
in the University dormitory and
eaten their meals in the fraternity
houses on a two week rotating
basis. This year they are living and
eating in the same house for the
entire year: Giancarlo Marchetti
in the Kappa Sigma house, Preben
Berthelsen in the Phi Epsilon Pi
house, and Anders Henriesson in
the Delta Upsilon house.

Last year the students themselves,
from Sweden, Norway and Italy

Foreign Students

were dissatisfied with the system of
rotating. They asserted that they
did not seem a part of one group.
“Every time we began to fit in at
home and know some of the broth-
ers, we had to move to another
house,” they stated. The Interfrater-
nity Council looked into this prob-
lem and came up with the new sys-
tem which apparently has worked
very well so far. The students seem
very pleased with it.

The University supplies the tui-
tion and the fees to two of the stu-
dents and the other receives the
Isador Scott scholarship. They came
to the University through the In-
stitute of International Education
in New York to whom they submit
applications. The IE chooses a list
of students who will come to the
States to study and then it is up
to the individual colleges to ask
for information on each of the stu-
dents for consideration. The colleges
put in a bid of their first choices
and the number they want.

Upon knowing who the student
will be in the Spring, the fraternities
are told about the system and are
given an opportunity to decide
whether or they want a student in
their house in the next year. The
| Interfraternity Council then has the
| task of determining exactly where
| the students will stay.

Period Of Adjustment

On behalf of the University, we welcome the more than
one thousand moms and dads who will visit us this weekend.

We would also like to issue our best wishes to the fresh-
men—this is your first Parents’ Weekend and you’d better not
spoil the act. If you get stagefright easily, just memorize the
following briefing:

 

Yes, the food is abominable and does not compare at all |

with the delicacies Mom used to serve; yes, you are very home-
sick, things just haven’t been normal since you left; no you
haven’t lost your toothbrush, you use it daily; yes you are
studying ten hours a day just like Dad advised in his last letter.

Firsthand, you may not see any reason for the above fabri-
cation; it only makes sense when you realize that your parents |

are going through a very difficult period of adjustment without

you, and all they ask of you this weekend is the added assurance |

they are still needed.

Revision Needed

Immediate revision is needed in the Federal law provid-
ing for the removal of a prisoner from the State courts to
Federal jurisdiction. Under existing laws, if a person’s Con-
stitutional rights are violated during arrest, he is only eligible
for removal to a national court if he can convince the Federal
District Court to grant Federal authority over the case. This
means that in the South where a judge might be somewhat
apathetic to the Federal Government, a defendant might not
always be judged on the merits of his case and therefore left at
the mercy of the State courts.

Before Congress now is a bill which will alleviate this situa-
tion. It provides that a prisoner trying to be moved to a Federal
Court can appeal the decision of the District Courts to the
Circuit Courts and even to the Supreme Court. This, of course,
permits one who is not satisfied with the District Court’s de-
cision to appeal to higher courts. The passage of this measure
seems to be good common sense. In almost all other cases
before the courts a defendant is allowed to appeal. Why then
should one who is charging the violation of his constitutional
rights not be given this opportunity?

In conclusion, the enactment of this law might provide
civil rights demonstrators who are under the opinion they have
been arrested in violation of their constitutional rights a better
chance to be tried in Federal courts and this measure will strike
another blow at the South’s fight against civil rights.

By BOB POTTS
Friday Columnist

Out of 613 cases submitted to the
Supreme Court this summer, the
nine justices must decide to rule on
such topics as
obscenity, legisla-
tive apportion-
ment, application
of the fifth
amendment, and
most important of
all, discrimination.

There are five
cases from Mary-
land, South Caro-
lina, and Florida
that deal with
civil rights dem-
onstrators who were arrested at
lunch counters, restaurants, etc. on
the basis of trespass laws.

What the court must decide is
if it is unconstitutional for state or
local governments to enforce ra-
cial discrimination in privately
owned public accommodations by
using police force.

The ramifications of future Su-
preme Court action is obvious in re-
lation to immediate civil rights leg-
islation, but is more significant in
other ways.

Potts Views Public Will Giving
US Constitution ‘Real Meaning’

No Easy Solution

The Constitution offers no easy
solution to such a problem and
those who all but recite articles
with each bead of their political
rosary will declare that the “pub-
lice accommodations” clause of the
Kennedy civil rights bill is uncon-
stitutional.

Indulging in a lapse from legal-
ity, Americans might for a mom-
ent consider the tone of the Con-
stitution. While it was written as a
series of compromises between
various factions of American so-
ciety, the Constitution serves today
as a concrete basis from which to

model our political actions. Yet
the will of the public is what
finally gives the Constitution any
real meaning.

Historical Case

There is a historical case in point
which illustrates this thought. God
gave to the Israelites a series of
codes to live by and Moses wrote
these on stone. In turn, God com-
manded the Israelies to build an
ark, the Ark of the Covenant and
place within it these laws or Torah.
Later, the Philistines captured the
Ark and thus caused one Israelite to
say, “The glory is departed from

LETTER TO

October 19, 1963
Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

A reply to the outlandish article,
“Communism, Conservatism Base
Ideology On Economy,” you pub-
lished last Friday is in order.

As a rejoinder I would like to lift
a quote, this being from one of the
leading American Conservatives:

“Conservatism is not an economic
theory, though it has economic im-
plications. The shoe is precisely on

THE EDITOR

the other foot: it is Socialism (Col-
lectivists, Communists, Liberals, et
al.) that subordinates all other con-
siderations to man’s material well-
being. It is Conservatism that puts
material things in their proper
place that has a structured view of
the human being and of human so-
ciety, in which economies plays only
a subsidiary role.

After Thirty-Seven Years

 

Dean Gilliam Continues To Serve His University

1926 as a member of the English
faculty. Designated Dean Emeritus
by the University’s Board of Trus-
tees, Dean Gilliam has not retired
in the usual sense of the word. He

Editor’s Note: The following ar-
ticle is taken in part from the sum-
mer issue of the Alumni Magazine.
Since most students, and the fresh-
men in particular, have no oppor-

tunity to read the Alumni publi-
cation, the Ring-tum Phi reprints
this story on the man who is a sym-
bol of Washington and Lee to count-
less students and many more gradu-
ates, Dean Frank J. Gilliam, Dean
Gilliam stepped down from his po-
sition as Dean of Admissions at the
end of last year.

When Dean of Admissions Frank
J. Gilliam vacated his office this
summer he moved two well-worn
leather chairs with him as reminders
of his work with generations of
Washington and Lee students.

Since 1931, nearly every Wash-
ington and Lee man has had at

least two chances to sit in one of}

those chairs. If an applicant to the
University did not visit with Dean
Gilliam in his role as Dean of Ad-
missions, then he probably got to see
him later—for one reason or an-
other—as Dean of Students.

Although Frank J. Gilliam only
officially “wore two hats” as Dean
of Students and Director of Admis-
sions from 1951 to 1962, he has been
at both jobs much longer. He be-
came Washington and Lee’s first
Dean of Students in 1931, and, as
admissions work grew in scope and
complexity, he assumed responsibili-
ty for both jobs. In 1962, at his own
request, he was relieved of his re-
sponsibilities as Dean of Students
that he might devote full attention to
the admissions program.

His retirement this summer ac~-
tually marked the close of 37 years
as a member of Washington and
Lee’s administration and faculty—
he first came to the University in

 

will continue to serve as a consult- ||

ant to the admissions office and as

a special advisor to President Fred | |

C. Cole.

His second floor Washington Hall ;

office has been relocated on the first | 7 i

floor. The 68-year-old Dean plans
to stay busy in his new role, but
the pressure of his former jobs he
leave behind.

Just as Dean Gilliam’s warm
friendship has marked the lives of
thousands of his students, his fore-

sight, energy, and capacity to get |

things done have led to achievements
that have made distinctive marks
of the University. He was influen-
tial in the planning that resulted
in the opening of Letitia Pate Evans

Dining Hall four years ago, and in j

the expansion of the University’s
dormitory facilities to accommodate
upperelassmen, law students, and a
slight inerease in the size of the
freshman class.

He established Washington and
Lee’s pattern of freshman living,
whereby new students are required
to reside in the dormitories under
the guidance of carefully selected
counselors. He helped promote the
formation of the University Publi-
cations Board. He was instrumental
in the development of the frater-
nity housemother system.

One of his proudest achievements
is the annual Freshman Camp, which
this September conducted its 32nd
three-day orientation and recreation
program at Natural Bridge for new
students. Dean Gilliam deserves the
title of “founding father” of the
camp, and served as its director until

1956. He still finds time each Sep-
tember to pay a visit to the camp-
site for at least one day.

Dean Gilliam was also instrumen-
tal in setting up the University’s
important faculty adviser program,
in which each new student comes
under the direct personal influence
of an experienced professor who
assists the young man in solving
problems both academic and per-
sonal. Dean Gilliam continually
sought ways to improve upon the
system, and worked diligently to
| match freshmen with the best pos-

sible faculty adviser, as suggested by
the student’s application informa-
tion and admission scores.

Much of Dean Gilliam’s work in-
volved him in fraternity relations.
He has served as chairman of the
faculty committee on fraternities,
and he has steadfastly labored to
strengthen the influence of the stu-
dent Interfraternity Council.

While the great majority of
Washington and Lee men know Dean
Gilliam as Dean of Students, per-
haps most educational associates
outside the University admire him

for his knowledge and experience
in the admissions field.

Washington and Lee’s admissions
program today is essentially Dean
Gilliam’s admissions program. Other
colleges and universities have used
his work as a model and profited
by his example. He is an enthusias-
tic supporter of the work of the)
College Entrance Examination Board,
of whose trustees President Cole is
now chairman. Largely through
Dean Gilliam’s urging, Washington |
and Lee became in 1950 the first |
men’s college in the South to re-
quire the Scholastic Aptitude Test}

 

 

\of the CEEB for all applications. |

Three years ago, again under Dean |
Gilliam’s leadership, Washington |
and Lee became the first men’s col-
lege in the South to require three |
CEEB achievement tests of each|
candidate for admission. |

Dean Gilliam’s stature as an ad-|
missions authority and his interest |
in the CEEB led to his appoint- |
ment in 1952 as the first represen-
tative of a Southern college to serve
on the CEEB’s executive commit-
tee, a post he held for three years.

In March, 1962, Dean Gilliam
was stricken with a heart attack at
the busiest time of the year for a
college admissions man. Dean Gil-
liam’s close associate of ten years,

Associate Dean of Admissions
James D. Farrar, took over effi-
cently, and completed the selec-

tion of the 1962 entering class in
a manner that reflected the inval-
uable experience to be gainea in
working with a person like Dean
Gilliam.

Dean Gilliam’s recovery was rap-
id and complete, and he returned to
his work in September, a year ago.
But he made no secret of his hope
to relinquish soon the heavy respon-

 

 

sibilities. As the end of the aca-
demic year 1962-63 approached, a
number of events suggested the
awareness of the student body and
alumni that the University would
be losing one of its outstanding
figures.

The Executive Committee set up

the “Gilliam Award” to recognize
meritorious contributions to the
University by a senior. Members

of the Board of Trustees arranged
for a portrait of Dean Gilliam to be
to the

presented University, and
the painting was hung in Evans
Dining Hall. The Ring-tum Phi

honored Dean Gilliam in editorial
praise and the 1963 Calyx was dedi-
cated to him with the words “Dean
Gilliam’s contribution to the prog-
ress of Washington and Lee trans-
cends all verbal tribute....” Presi-
dent Cole singled him out for praise
in the 1963 graduation remarks, and
Dean Gilliam was accorded 4 stand-
ing ovation.

Like all dynamic men in an aca-
demic setting, he helped build his
own legend that future Washington
and Lee men will share. Generations
of students remember his big,
broad-rimmed slouch hats, and his
distinctive walk. His phenomenal
ability to remember names is an ex-
ample of the personal interest in
his students that has always charac-
terized Dean Gilliam.

In his traditional address to the
entering class each fall Dean Gil-
liam was able to create a feeling of
the spirit of Washington and Lee as
no other speaker could. Although
he no longer gives a speech to each

Booters Play On Wilson Field
This Saturday For W&L Parents

By TIM HENRY

This Saturday, Wilson Field will
be the scene of a soccer game in-
stead of the usual Football contest.
Coach Lyles’ soecermen take on
King College in its sixth game of
the season. Lyles wants very much
for soccer to gain popularity in this
section of the country, and this
could serve a wonderful opportuni-
ty for publicity through the parents
who will be there this weekend.
Dr. Cole is expected to be present
to witness the action. Programs will
be provided for the uninformed. If
you have never seen a soccer game,
come and watch for a while, if only

out of curiosity. Rated internation-
ally, soecer is the world’s most
spectacular sport, so there has to
be something to the game.

About the Game

Last year the Generals tied King
4-4 at Bristol, Tenn., in a game
played in a continuous downpour
which turned the field into a quag-
mire. Forty-five to fifty degree
weather made the game even more
uncomfortable. King beat VPI 3-0,
while W&L defeated the Tech team
5-0, so the game should be close
with W&L bearing a slight advant-
age. With a heavy schedule coming
the soccermen will be anxious to get
another victory under their feet
before playing U.Va., and Roanoke.
With six games to play there is still
time to amass an excellent record.

According to the latest standings,
W&L is second in the state behind
U.Va., with Lynchburg in third
place. In spite of a mere 3-2 record,
the Generals have outscored their
opponents 15-6, a tribute to the
team’s excellent defense, as well as
to the offense.

No one man can be singled out
of the defense as the best, it works
as a team. As typical of the de-

as to just who is the number one
one small college team in the coun-
try. David Shufflebarger seems to
accept unconditionally “the top na-
tional sports magazine’s” opinion
that Wittenberg leads the pack.
While not trying to take anything
away from Wittenberg, we’d like to
nominate several other teams which
we feel are better—namely, Dela-
ware, Northern Illinois, and Florida
A&M. Delaware has rolled to a 46
point per game average, highest in
the nation, over a rougher sched-
ule than Wittenberg. Florida A&M,
year in and year out, leads the small
colleges in players drafted by the
pros. George Bork, Northern IIli-
nois’ quarterback, has many days
like last Saturday—38 out of 53 for
445 yards to give Northern Illinois
its number one ranking in the UPI

FOOTBALL TEAM TO MEET H.5. TIGERS

Injuries Plaguing Generals

By BILLY CANNON

Friday Sports Writer
W&L still licking their wounds
from last week’s 31-0 defeat travel
to Hampden-Sydney tomorrow to
clash with the always tough Tigers.

Coach Lee McLaughlin will be
without the services of starters Syd
Butler and Bill Angel. Also missing
from the squad will be quarterback
Brice Gamber and sophomore half-
back Harry’ Brookby. Several
others, including Henry Sackett,
will play still feeling the pains of
last week’s contest. Butler and
Angel both suffered leg injuries.
Gamber separated his shoulder and
Brookby hurt his back.

Joe Miller will replace Angel go-
ing both ways for the Generals at
guard. Either Dan Manson or John
Anthony will spell Butler.

“We can’t take Hampden-Sydney
too lightly. They’ve won three of five

this season and have a fine balanced

team,” commented Coach Mac, who
also said, “our line-up may contain
a few shake-ups.”

McLaughlin, not at all pleased
with the locals performance against
Susquehanna, pointed out the Gen-
erals will have to stop Trav Ty-
singer and Whitey Lipscomb if W&L
is going to win. Tysinger, a big half-
back who came close to dawning
the Blue and White of Washington
and Lee, runs well and is a con-
stant threat throwing a lefthanded
pass from his halfback post. Lips-
comb, a seasoned veteran, “passes
and handles the club very well.”

“Look for a close game,” continued
McLaughlin. “In my seven years
here we have split the six previous
games. We have been fortunate in
winning the last three, but it’s
interesting to note that none of

 

John Madison, Angel Out

the victories were by more than one
touchdown.”

The Tigers ran up 25 first downs
last week, completely dominating
the game statistic-wise, but fell vic-
tim to Western Maryland, 15-12.
They have also played CAC foe
Sewanee losing 49-0 early in the
season.

“I hope we'll be ready to go.
Syd (Butler) will hurt us on de-
fense, but I look for the boys to
bounce back after last week.”

 

X-Country To Meet C.U.

The W&L cross-country team
meets Catholic University tomorrow
afternoon. The Generals will be
seeking their fourth victory in five
starts.

A look at past performances
seemingly gives Coach Miller’s run-
ners an advantage. Catholic Uni-
versity has lost to Bridgewater, a
team which W&L defeated handily.
The Generals also have the advan-
tage of running on their home course.

However, four of the top five
W&L runners have minor injuries

Letter To The Editor

(Continued from page 2)

Conservatives and the Liberals of
today is that Conservatives take ac-
count of the whole man, while
Liberals tend to look only at the ma-|
terial side of man’s nature. The Con-
servative believes that man is, in|
part, an economic, an animal crea-
ture; but that he is also a spiritual |
creature with spiritual needs and|
spiritual desires. What is more, these |
needs and desires reflect the superior |
side of man’s nature, and thus take |
precedence over his economic wants. |
Conservatism, therefore, looks upon |
the enhancement of man’s spiritual |
nature as the primary concern of |
political philosophy. Liberals, on the
other hand—in the name of a con-
cern for ‘human beings’—regard the
satisfaction of economic wants as
the dominant mission of society.”

science of a Conservative, page 10.)

Letters To The Editor ...

 

 

Dear Mr. Brockenbrough:

You must be having “second
thoughts” yourself about the un-
reasoned and_ exceedingly loose

labels you enjoy sticking onto oth-
ers. I refer, of course, to myself—
the “self-styled prophet” who is
“running down school spirit” in
what you apparently consider an
evil attempt to destroy the football
team or the school’s spirit or both.

In the first place, in a purely con-
notative sense, the term “young
prophet” is incorrect in that my let-
ter of last week prophesyed nothing
but rather suggested that we play
better teams.

In the second place, I would like
to point out that someone who is so
pretentious as to publish a rather
personal column (even if it is an-
ymous) should understand what he
is talking about before he sticks
his neck out. To accuse me of try-
ing to run down school spirit dem-
onstrates that you couldn’t have
given last week’s letter more than
a cursory glance before writing your
column. I realize that unlike most of
the “young” (to use your expres-
sion) students here, you are proba-

bly very busy with weighty matters.
but if you will re-read the letter,
you might notice that I only offered
constructive criticism as to how
school spirit might be improved.

Next, you assume that school spirit
is beginning to be generated. If it
isn’t too great a strain on your
already-ponderous column, prove
it . . . in print. On what basis can
you flatly state that “a bit of it
(school spirit) is being generated”?
Is your evidence for this “genera-
tion” based on the sorry perfor-
mance of the spectators at Home-
coming, and if this is the case, do
you consider incoherent mumbling
and stoney silence indicative of en-
thusiasm?

In conclusion, Mr. Brockenbrough,
I do not object to your disagreeing
with me about our playing generally
poor teams—many do. I do, however,
strongly object to the cavalierly,
assinine, patronizing, and arrogant
manner in which you _ registered
your objection.

In Richmond Speeches

 

Conservatives Espouse Doctrine

By BARRY VAUGHT

Last Thursday Wyatt Durrette and
Bill Braithwaite, two members of
the Conservative Society of Wash-
ington and Lee, went to Richmond
to give two talks, one at Marymount
Catholic Girls’ School and the other
at the Medical College of Virginia.

Their speeches at the Marymount
School concerned the conservative
stand on four topics: the nuclear
test ban treaty, the sale of American
wheat to Russia, civil rights, and
Barry Goldwater’s chances for the
Republican nomination. At the Medi-
cal College they presented a general
statement of conservative principles
and the liberal principals on the in-
dividual versus the collective concept
of man.

Four Main Topics

Thursday afternoon at the girls’
school they gave these views on their
four topics. They felt that both the
test ban treaty and the wheat sale
were not going to help the United
States’ position at all, for at this
time Russia has found it must put
more money into its total economy
rather than just its military econ-
omy. To stop nuclear testing would
enable them to direct that money
into the rest of its economy, and,
for example, enable them to buy
American wheat. Also, Russia has
broken 50 of the last 52 agreements
they have made with the United
States. For these reasons the con-
servatives oppose these measures.

On ‘the topic of civil rights, they
posed questions and asked each per-
son to answer them in their own
mind. They also pointed out that
while Goldwater did, at one time,
help the NAACP in his state, he is
opposed to the present civil rights
legislation. And about his chances
of receiving the Republican nomina-
tion, they felt he had an excellent
chance. From a poll it was found
that 68 per cent of all Republicans
are considered conservative, and
77 per cent of the members of the
House of Representatives consider
themselves conservative. He also en-

 

joys great popularity in the South-
ern states, for the South is generally
conservative.

New Residence

ByCHARLES NEWMAN

A new sight in town has been
the work going on at 110 Preston
Street. This is the site of the new
Sigma Phi Epsilon house. The house
was purchased in August and work
began on the first of September with
the return of the actives of SPE.
The moving in will hopefully take
place some time next week.

The house itself was built around
1850 and has changed hands several
times since. There are three floors
and a basement. The first floor con-
tains two dining rooms, a living
room, and a lounge area. The ceil-
ing on the first floor has been
covered with acoustical tile. The
second and third floor will accom-
modate a maximum of twenty-two.
The third floor has a forced ex-
haust system for better cooling.

The whole house has ben re-
wired and has new sockets and
outlets. The plumbing has been re-
worked and new fixtures added. The
entire house has been painted and
a porch with four columns added to
the front.

Student-Faculty Banquet Plans,
Fund, Drive Discussed By IFC

By MIKE HASH
Plans for the upcoming Faculty- |

Student Banquet, the results of de- |
ferred rush, and fraternity participa- |
tion in United Fund drive were the |
main topics of discussion in the IFC |
meeting Monday night.

Art Broaddus, IFC President, pre-
sented the details of the banquet.
Members of the faculty and two
representatives from each fraternity
will meet in discussion groups fol-
lowing dinner, which will be held in
Evans Dining Hall. Topics will in-
clude the future of fraternities, em-
phasis on scholarship, rushing and
pledge training.

New Pledges

Five fraternities announced new
pledges acquired during the defer-
red rush period. They are: Lambda
Chi Alpha—Dan Eadie, Skip Brooks,
and Scot Jarrett; Delta Upsilon—|
Bob Robertson, Brad Rochester, and |
Jeff Skarda; SAE Randy Chitwood; |

 

Kappa Sigma— John Hillyer; and
Phi Kappa Sigma—Jim Cooper and
Chip Gordy.

Beta sophomore Steve Yancey was
elected chairman of ‘the IFC chari-
ty drive. During the drive, each fra-
ternity will be asked to support the
United Fund through a chapter as-
sessment.

New Constitution

A new constitution was discussed,
which is being drafted by a consti-
tutional committee. The committee
expects to present the new consti-
tution to the IFC in a few weeks, at
which time it must be ratified by
the fraternities in order to become
effective.

NOTICE

All students who want to make
up their Calyx pictures must do so
this week between 1:30 and 5:00
p.m, Friday will be the last day.

~| meet the high goal, It is simply there

lege, they presented a program con-
cerned with America’s traditions as
seen through a conservative’s eyes.
With the advent of the new views on
so many things, the old American
inheritance is being thrown away
without regard to whether it is good
or bad. They stressed the pood points
found in American history and re-
minded those present that many
tend to only remember the bad
events in history. One should love
the things his ancestors fought for
and wanted to pass on to later gen-
erations. Then they presented a short
resume of the foreign policy from
a conservative standpoint.

 

Debate, Concert Highlight
Parents’ Weekend Events

What one administration official
described as “the most successful
Parents’ Weekend yet” was news-
worthy, in particular, for the num-
ber and quality of activities held
for the visitors.

Chief among these activities were
the faculty discussion on economics,
the demonstration student debate,
the Glee Club concert and the facul-
ty discussion on “Why Johnny Can’t
Write.” (See story, column 3.)

“The Proposed Tax Cut: Its Ef-
fect on the Economy” was the topic
discussed by Dr. Jay Cook and Dr.
Charles F. Phillips, Jr., Friday night
as a feature of Parents’ Weekend.

The discussion, which consisted of
a statement from each speaker and
a discussion from the floor, was
narrated by Mr. John F. deVogt.
In a brief introduction of the topic,
Mr. deVogt outlined Kennedy’s pro-
posed tax cut, which will cover a
three-year span and amount to a
net cut of $10.4 billion.

Reserve Board Holds Key

“Nobody’s sure what’s going to
happen—it depends on our spend-
ing and the Federal Reserve Board,”
said Dr. Cook, in reference to the
fact that the effectiveness of the tax
cut depends upon the Federal Re-
serve Board buying long-term
bonds, to encourage investment by
not borrowing from the public.

Dr. Cook spoke of the effects in
investment and consuming resulting
from the proposed tax cut, and
stressed the importance of the di-
rection of consumer spending if we
have a cut. The greatest cuts, ac-
cording to Dr. Cook, will be in the
highest and lowest income brackets,

 

Mass Medias

Parents’ Weekend. *

The trio of professors claimed that
the inadequacy in most freshman
writing lay in lack of organization,
inability to mold sequences and the
relation of thoughts, prolixity, and
vagueness. They blamed these faults
on faulty use of the language in
government press releases, periodi-
cals which incorrectly use phrases
but do it often enough to have them
coined, the superlatives and abso-
lutes used in the advertising media,
and professional jargon.

Professors Challenged

The most interesting part of the
evening came when, shortly before
9 o'clock, the discussion was opened
to the audience. Mr. Duval had
closed official comment with two
passages—one from Bacon’s “Of stu-
dies,’ and one from Donne’s “Med-
itations.” Both were examples of the
excellent examples use of our lan-
guage, according to the professors,
and they concluded by saying tht it
was the responsibility of the pres-
ent generation to recognize what our
forebears have done with the English
language, and meet our challenge
of carrying on this work.

This evoked a spirited response
from one parent, who asked if the
models chosen by the professors
were not too high—if it wasn’t ridic-
ulous to ask a freshman to endeavor
to write as Donne and Bacon did.
He stated that he felt the effort
should not be made—that such a
goal should never be set.

Few Future Donne's

The English professors objected,
pointing out that they expected few,

Mess-Up

By Lousy Use of Lingo

Professors Duvall, Coulling, and Boatwright of the Eng-
lish department blamed the poor writing of many college fresh-
men on the poor example of their most immediate predeces-
sors in an informal talk entitled “Why Johnny Can’t Write”
last Friday night. The panel discussion, given before a half-
filled duPont Auditorium crowd, was part of the program of

the poor writing ability of fresh-
men, so why be so concerned about
it now?

Mr. Boatwright answered this by
saying that there is strong evidence
of a definite decline in the ability of
the average American to write, as
compared with his nineteenth cen-
tury forebear. Civil War diaries dem-
onstrate excellent writing, he said,
for the type of person who was doing
the writing. People of today of the
same educational background can-

An Element of Santa Claus

“I think the present tax-cut pro-
gram has an element of Santa Claus
in it—a little bit for everybody!”
commented Dr. Phillips, opposing
Dr. Cook’s viewpoint. Dr. Phillips
further stated that “Our problem in
1963 is not to take temporary meas-
ures, but to take a ‘long-run’ point
of view. To strengthen our economy
we need a five, ten, or fifteen year
plan—not a one or two year pro-
gram.”

Dr. Phillips suggested a five-year
program, to avoid burdening the
country’s international payments,
and to avoid any severe cutbacks of
the national budget.

A discussion from the floor fol-
lowed the two talks, during which
the speakers answered questions
and discussed other aspects of the
national economy.

 

Jefferson: A Traitor?

Also held Friday night in conjunc-
tion with Parents’ Weekend was the
student debate on “Resolved: That
Thomas Jefferson Would Be Tried
for Treason Today.” The affirmative
side was taken by Mike Hayslip and
Bill Noell. Defending the negative
were Al Eckes and Jay Clark.

The affirmative debated that Jef-
ferson would be out of step in four
fields: Economics and social, dis-
cussed by Hayslip, politics and edu-
cation, discussed by Noell. Econo-
mically Jefferson wanted a bare
minimum for a national debt, and
he believed that a person should
never be taxed more than 1 per
cent of his income. Jefferson was an
ardent supporter of states’ rights
and was in favor of rebellion and
revolution. In education Jeffedson
thought tthe federal government
should have nothing to do with the
school system.

Aside from singing at the Mary

local girls’ schools, the Sazeracs have
no definite plans for this fall. In the
spring, however, they will be going

Taboo Club. Last year, while in
Palm Beach, they appeared on tele-

Singing Fraternity

The Sazeracs are the oldest of
the informal groups on campus.
They were formed in 1955. With
the addition of two new men, Rob
Vaughan and Pete Hendricks, their
group now numbers an even dozen.
The president of the Sazeracs is
John Weinbrenner, and the manager
is John Baker. The others in the
group are Bill Staniar, Chuck Grif-
fin, Dave Streetman, Eric Wilson,
Dave Britt, Bob Aylan, Bud Good-
heart, and Mark Gee. The Sazeracs
describe themselves as a “social
singing fraternity,” and as Staniar
commented, “Our aim is to have fun
with the songs we do.” The LP
record which the Sazeracs have
coming out this fall gives a good
example of the variety of songs
they work with. Samples off this
album are “Somewhere Over the
Rainbow,” “Gunslinger,” and “Ben-
ny is from Heaven.”

Campus Eyesore

Imagine yourself, for a minute, as a proud parent who
has come to see his son’s school. You are about to take a
sight-seeing tour around the campus; you walk through
the arch of the dorm and across the quad, down the
sidewalk—and what is the first thing you see?

That’s right.

The old “Co-op.”

Ignore, if you will, the paint hanging off in slabs, the
cobwebs on the windows. Aren’t you inclined, though, to
wonder what the building is used for? When you are told
“nothing,” aren’t you liable to be slow on the draw the
next time you get a letter asking for a donation to help
finance a project like the recently-completed science build-
ing?

The uses for this building are restricted only by the
imagination. Right now it contains a couple of offices, and
ninety percent of it is used for storage space. There are
a few courses that are too large for any classroom the
school has; if the old Co-op was cleaned up it would do
admirably. And it is a safe bet that many students would
like to see a concession started again, since the new “Co-
op” is often closed when you need that cup of coffee.

However, if the building is allowed to stand idle—
as we imagine it will—let’s at least give it a coat of paint
so we won’t be embarrassed to show visitors around cam-

pus.

‘Long - Distance Runner’
Lacks Only In Excitement

By Tom Pace
The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner plays for the last
the last time tonight at the Lyric Theater. It is a film by Tony
Richardson, who may soon lay his claim as the finest of English
film-makers.

 

In his past movies, Richardson has displayed
several talents requisite of a great director: an
ability for handling actors and drawing excellent
performances from them, an ability for bringing
both characters and story to life, and an ability
to mix humor and drama in a successful blend.

Yet two primary qualities are lacking in
Richardson—the craft of creating with the camera
alone and, it follows, the ability to generate ex-
citement through meaningful creativity with the

camera.
Original Use of Camera

In The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner
Richardson conquers the first of these problems
and shows promise of solving the second. This time he seems willing
to play and experiment. His camera rolls, runs, stops, speeds up, all
in an attempt to achieve the precise mood desired. That he suc-
ceeds in evoking the right mood, time and time again, with only
the moving camera as a tool indicates he has cleared the first of these
hurdles .

The title itself presents what was Richardson’s major problem
in the making of this film. By its statement, Richardson is required
to explain not simply why the runner is lonely, but how he is lonely,
ie., the substance of his loneliness. In order to accomplish this the
director could not merely show ‘the character and his external en-
vironment. He also had to probe and explicate the character’s mind.

Flashbacks Establish Depth

He does this by the use of flashbacks. Through the flashbacks
you see Colin Smith’s thoughts. You see not only the causes, but also
the effect of his loneliness within him. However, in accomplishing the
problem set up by the title, a fault paradoxically evolves. Though
scattered throughout the film, the flashbacks are in fact ordered and
have a chain-like logic. Thus the illusion of reality is partially de-
stroyed, since obviously nobody does think in chains of events, or
logical order. Yet this seems but a minor blemish, for Richardson
enacts these flashbacks smoothly and consistently so that they do
not disturb the viewer.

No Excitement Generated

The film falls short of greatness because of the reason stated in
the first paragraph. Richardson is unable to generate enthusiasm
and excitement despite a significant theme and despite his many
significant capabilities. Unlike Truflaut, who has the distinct genius
for making you feel that each of his films is a great one, no matter
how trival his subject, Richardson lacks fulfillment. Nonetheless,
Richardson shows certain promise that he may well become one
of the four or five great directors of this time.

Beginning tomorrow at the Lyric is Rashomon, a film by Akira
Korosawa, one of the few men who already rank in the league to
which Richardson aspires. And fortunately, Rashomon has the repu-
tation as Korosawa’s best, and as one of the finest films of all time.
I have not seen it yet, but pre-judgment concludes it is probably a
masterpiece.

Openings In Retrospect:
The Freshmen Enjoyed It

Editor’s Note: After Openings Weekend had come to a close, the
Tuesday Edition of the Ringtum Phi sent freshman reporter Neid
McGehee through the dorms to question his classmates as to their
reactions about the events which took place. Forty-two freshmen
were questioned, and the results of this survey are offered below.

In the opinion of most of those students polled, Saturday night’s
concert with the Upsetters and Roy Hamilton and the release of
the fall issue of The Southern Collegian were the two highlights
of the weekend. Twenty-eight of the freshmen polled were highly
impressed by the concert, three were not satisfied, and eleven did
not attend it at all. HKighty per cent of those intervied enjoyed
The Southern Collegian, ten per sent did not like it (usually because
they had seen better issues in the past, they indicated), and one
freshman had not seen the magazine.

Although fraternity parties had the best attendance, they were
not as well received as some of the other weekend activities. Those
students who saw the Olympics, who performed for the Friday
afternoon cocktail party at the Mayflower, and then for fraternity
engagements all day Saturday, thought they were “great.” The
rock-and-roll singing quartet was the only facet of the weekend

‘The Names and Faces of Heroes’
A Collection of Tales Simply Told

By JAMES LEDBETTER

Reynolds Price, The Names and
Faces of Heroes, ($3.95)

Many will remember Reynolds
Price as the author of A Long and
Happy Life or for the lecture he
gave here last
year concerning
this prize-winning
first novel. The
volume now under
consideration is
his second ef-
fort, a book of
seven short stories
entitled The
Names and Faces
of Heroes. The
last of these
stories was pub-
lished in the final number of the
Shenandoah last year.

Unlike most young writers today,
Price writes simply and without
artificiality—but as any reader of
Hemingway knows, there is nothing
as complicated as simplicity. Price
tells his stories with simplicity, and
his themes are simple, in that they

 

Ledbetter

are timeless.
Maturation Themes

Price is especially sensitive to the
manner in which people grow up—
the way in which they mold them-
selves after a person they admire,
or their reaction when they discover
something about the world they
didn’t know before.

The title story tells of a search
for a hero; a young boy has been
told by his camp councellor that
he should select one, and he looks
hard without ever seeming to find
one—until he discovers that his fath-
er had been his hero all along. But
there is no sentimentality here; Mr.
Price knows very well the way a
boy can hate his father at the same
time he loves him.

Rosacoke’s First Appearance

Readers of A Long and Happy Life
will be pleasantly surprised at find-
ing the heroine of that novel, Rosa-
coke Mustian, in the first story, “A
Chain of Love.” In the strange empa-
thy Rosacoke feels for a boy whose
father is dying, and the way she
expresses it, we find her once again

the most enduring heroine we have
met in a long time.
“Uncle Grant”

My favorite—next to the title
story—is “Uncle Grant.” If you see
nothing heroic about a hired hand,
this story might change your mind.
Especially engaging is the direct
way in which this story is told—
Mr. Price uses his own name when
the characters are talking about him.
Throughout the book there is a
gradual development in style, which
becomes experimental in the last two
stories.

Mr. Price never sounds bitter,
though he has written a story that
is very contemporary in “Michael
Edgeton.” In this a boy at camp
meets, for the first time, his “new
father”—an experience that many
know first hand.

I find it hard to review a volume
of short stories—especially this one,
as the stories are so unaffected that
to say anything technical about them
would be hypocritical. I hope they
find some readers—especially on this
campus.

 

A View Of Campus Life

Freshmen - Are They Changing ?

ington and Lee seems to be chang-
ing, and everyone from the frater-
nity men to the independent is

another.

It occurred to me the other day
that an article on the supposed
“changing student body” might help
everyone including myself—some-
thing on the order of a “Know
Thyself” column. Seriously, I have
tried to interview people around
school who would have a perspec-
tive on the changing conditions here
and to assimilate their views in the
following column.

The big word both this year and
last during rush week was “this
year’s freshman class is really full
of fish.” The idea that this state-
ment rather unpicturesquely tries
to express is that the incoming
freshmen class has a larger per
cent of academically oriented stu-
dents. All this is very vague and
actually does little more than
make good, flammable conversa-
tion.

In search of some tangible evi-
dence, I dropped in on Dean Farrar.
He was eager to discuss the topic
and began by pointing out what we
have all heard, that the college board
scores and class rankings of the in-
coming students are now higher than
ever. He added, however, that this
may not actually be a valid scale
for change, since perhaps the stu-
dent’s attitude toward his school-
work is really the important factor.

“It is always a tendency,” Dean
Farrar pointed out, “to idealize the
past. I personally doubt whether
the bull sessions at the fraternity
houses and around campus have
changed a great deal since I was
here.” This point about always ideal-

Political Horizons

 

Liberalism: Values Individual Citizen,
Opposes Dogmatism, Seeks Adventure

Note: With this number the
Tuesday Edition begins a year-
long series concerning national
politics. On alternate Tuesdays the
liberal and conservative viewpoints
on selected issues, national and
international, will be presented.
Next week Wyatt Durrette and
Bill Braithwaite will present the
conservative philosophy.

By TRACY HARRINGTON

Liberalism is a belief in the
value of the human _ personality,
and a conviction
that the source of
all progress lies in
the free exercise
of individual en-
ergy. It cherishes
the democratic
faith that the av-
erage man is cap-
able of becoming
superior.

It is a spirit of
eagerness, part of
the American
Dream, for it encourages adventure
rather than security. It wishes to
make possible for all individuals and
groups to have the opportunity to
exercise their powers, so far as this
can be done without injury to others.

 

Harrington

Liberalism recogniges the revo-
lutionary changes that occur in

the modern world, and regards as
elemental common _ sense the
awareness that solutions of former
decades will not necessarily prove
adequate today. As it opposed dog-
matism in religion and morals in
the 19th Century, so it now op-
poses dogmatism in economics and
polities,

It therefore involves a readiness to
use the power of the State for the
purpose of creating the conditions
within which individual liberty can
thrive—of preventing abuses of
power—of affording to every citizen
the means of acquiring mastery of
his own capacities—of establishing
to every citizen a real equality of
opportunity.

Liberalism believes that the remo-
val of age-old anxieties and fears
(as in social security programs) does
not weaken moral fibre, whereas the
defense of comfortable privilege does
precisely this.

It recognizes the insidious dan-
gers, in a large, wealthy and com-
plex nation, of bureaucracy, mo-
noply, the waste of natural re-
sources; but it is more concerned
with the waste of human beings
who, by the very size and imper-
sonality of forces in the modern
world, cannot live full lives.

A Liberal cannot rest so long as

38 million Americans are poor, 20
million Negroes endure discrimina-
tion, 6 million adults are unemploy-
ed.

He recognizes as the dangers of
Liberal faith the tendency to think
of people in groups (Labor, for ex-
ample, or the Negro); to rely so
completely upon governmental ac-
tion to produce a better world that
the reason for this reliance—the
growth of individuality—is forgotten.

Like the Conservative, the Lib-
eral cherishes the institutions that
have made America great, but he
tries to guard himself against the
tendency to preserve a status quo
by which only “we” benefit, and
to imagine nostalgically that, in a
swiftly moving world, we can go
back to some happier condition of
earlier days. He tries to see the
difference between fundamental
principles and practical policies,
asking in each situation, “What is
indispensable?”

Liberty is a spiritual activity; it
can best be preserved by means of
new acquisitions of liberty and op-
portunity. The men of the American

Revolution put their belief in free-
dom above their personal privilege;
they were not afraid to challenge
the existing order even thought it
had been for them a comfortable and
privileged order.

Coun Syuire:

By ADDISON BROCKENBROUGH

October 27, 1963
Sunday

I've noted with amusement re-
cent attempts by certain factions
within the student body to “revita-
lize” conventional dress.

They are afraid the tradition is
dying, so I understand, and wanted
to “enforce it more strongly.”

Maybe I’m mixed up on definition,
but I always thought you “enforced”
rules—not traditions. It seems to me
that nobody has bothered to say why
conventional dress is good, just that
it is traditional.

If they are going to regulate and
codify this “tradition”’—even to the
extent of specifying what color shirts
you can wear with a tie—conven-
tional dress won’t be much more
than a military uniform.

It could be the tradition is dying.
And if it is, the alternatives that
W&L students are faced with are
(1) giving up now and doing away
with the whole thing, (2) codifying
the “tradition” and for the sake of
honesty call it a rule instead, or (3)
trying to convey something of the
spirit of conventional dress—why it’s
worthwhile, why a man of Lee’s
calibre ever started it in the first
place .

Of course a positive approach
would be hard to effect and would
call for some serious critical thought
on conventional dress. Maybe that’s
too much to ask.

There’s the possibility, of course,
that a positive approach wouldn’t
work. But there’s a chance it would,
and this, it seems to me, justifies
trying.

I would like a concerted effort
made to inculcate the spirit of con-
ventional dress into entering stu-
dents. More explicitly, I’d like to
see reasons—specific ones—given as
to why it is a good thing. The mark
of distinction it lends to the campus,
the heightened formality of the
classroom atmosphere resulting from
the coat and tie, and, most import-
antly, the spirit of gentlemmanliness
which conventional dress symbolizes
are a few of the things that should
be stressed.

It might help, also, if the benefiits
of dressing as one pleases were
pointed out. Just what would the
campus be gaining by abolishing
conventional dress, as opposed to
what would be lost?

My guess is that it would be made
evident that the benefits of conven-
tional dress far outweight those of
free dress.

At any rate, I like the tradition
and believe there is a lot to be said
in its defense, and more to be ac-
complished by selling it to fresh-
men than by forcing it on them.

Tigers Narrowly Upset W&L's

2 Long Drives In

Closing Minutes}

Help H-S Humble 5-Star Generals

Two long fourth-quarter drives, highlighted by the passing

of Hampden-Sydney’s Whitey

Lapscomb and a disallowed

W&L inerception gave the Tigers a close 12-11 victory over

the visiting Generals Saturday,
two games. *

The disputed pass-play came with
Washington and Lee leading, 11-6,
late in the fourth quarter; Lipscomb,
who had engineering the first H-SC
scoring drive in that period, lofted
a long pass intended for Tiger end,
Kent Carter. Wé&lL’s defence ace,
Bill David, covering Carter, outleap-
ed his man and apparently came
down with a drive-stopping inter-
ception. The refree, however, gave
the pigskin to Carter who had fallen
on David and wrapped his arms
around the ball also.

Tigers Score Clincher

Five plays later the Tigers scored
the decisive TD on the quarterback’s
plunge from the one. A two point
conversion pass attempt was over-
shot, but the Generals’ final race
against the clock was unsuccessful,
as Coach McLaughlin’s charges suf-
fered their second loss in five games.

Hampden-Sydney received the
the kickoff and marched for six
quick first downs before the Gen-
eral defenses got adjusted and stop-
ped the drive. From that point the
game became somewhat of a defen-
sive contest. W&L initiated the scor-
ing as a result of a recovered fum-
ble by Henry Sackett on H-SC’s
34-yard line. Washington and Lee
then marched to the Tiger ten where
they were stopped, and after several
losing plays, Jim Crothers came in
to split the uprights with a 27-yard
field goal to give the Generals a
3-0 second quarter lead.

The W&L harriers continued their
winning ways at home with a 19-43
victory over Catholic University
Saturday before a fine Parents’
Weekend crowd.

 

Captain Andy Kilpatrick overcame | |
a 200-yard lead at the two-mile |'

mark and captured first place with a
time of 24:55 minutes. This was the
best time run this year, and only
about 15 second off the record set
by Mike Shanks two years ago.

Sophomore Rif O’Connor ran sec-
ond for the Generals with freshman
Bill Wildrick, sophomore Lee John-
son, and junior Bob Patton taking
the next three places. Over-all the
times were below par because of the
unusually hot, dry, October day.

Coach Miller commented that he
was pleased with the good team
performance and that sophomores
Scott Kennedy and Clyde Fochee,
who had been given a rest last week
because of injuries would be running
again this Saturday as the cross-
country men face American Univer-

By TOM CARPENTER
Tuesday Sports Writer
Time is a precious commodity,
and the Washington and Lee soccer
team will agree with the old adage
as ten minutes made all the differ-
ence in the world to them. The Gen-
erals scored two goals in the two
five-minutes overtimes to take a
5-3 come-from-behind victory over
King College here Saturday before
the largest crowd ever to see a W&L
home soccer game.

King College scored first with 14
minutes left in the first quarter
when there was a mix-up in sig-
nals between goalie Tom Green and
one of the fullbacks. Green called
for the fullback to let the ball go,
but he did not and muffed the
kick. Jack Brown alertly recovered
the poor kick and booted it into the
nets .

Generals Tie It Up

W&L tied it up with 6:30 left in
the same period on the first of two
goals by the “Great Dane,” Preben
Berthelsen. He kicked it from the
left into the right corner. Wes Hor-
ner, Bruce Jackson and Tim Henry
did nice jobs in getting the ball to
him for the shot.

Midway in the second quarter
Green made a g”eat save as he slap-
ped the ball away from the goal,
but unfortunately for Green it gave
the losers a corner kick. Green had
no other alternative than to make
the save that way. Sam McCoy
kicked from the corner, and Brian
Walter headed it in with 10:22 left.

The Generals tied it with 1:30 left
in the half when Chris Clarke drove
in a penalty kick from 10 yards out.

The winners lost a goal in the third
period when King fullback Howard
Bivens made a great play on a direct
kick from 13 yards when the goalie
was caught out of position.

Freshman Soccer
Team Bows, 3-1

By MARC WINSTON
Tuesday Sports Writer

Yesterday afternoon the W&L
freshman soccer team journeyed to
Charlottesville only to meet defeat
at the hands of the Cavayearlings by
a score of three to one.

Virginia led at halftime, one to
nothing, by virture of a_ penalty
goal. A W&L player had been guilty
of using his hands in the penalty
area. In the third period U.Va. in-
creased their lead to two to nothing.
The score came when U. Va. was
awarded a penalty kick because a
W&L player had shielded the goalie.
W&L broke into the scoring column
in the third period on a goal by
McGehee with an assist from Brad
Schinkel. U. Va. added a goal in
the fourth period and that ended the
scoring.

There were two major factors in
the U.Va. victory. One was the W&L
defensive mistakes which resulted in
the two Virginia penalty shots. The
other was the superior overall speed

goal. He headed it in from the left
corner.

W&L lost another goal before ty-
ing the game. Henry’s head shot hit
the bar at the top of the nets after
Berthelsen had set him up with a
perfect pass. But Berthelsen was not
discouraged. With 7:44 left the Great
Dane gave Dave Kirkpatrick a per-
fect pass directly in front of the
goal and the little sparkplug booted
it by goalie John Neill.

The Generals had two more
chances to win before the overtime,
but luck wasn’t with them. Hor-
ner’s shot hit the top of the goal,
and Jackson’s shot just missed
catching the corner of the nets.

The winners wasted little time in
the overtime as Jackson scored with
55 seconds left in the first period
from 15 yards. Jackson got his goal
when he gained control of a loose
bounding ball directly in front of
the nets. They almost got another
before the end of the period s
Neill made a great save on Pete
Preston’s attempt. Neill batted the
sinking ball over the goal.

Berthelsen added an insurance
score with 5:11 left in the second
overtime on a penalty shot.

Light Brigade
Drubs Eagles;
Defense Good

By GORDON GAY
Tuesday Sports Writer

Led by quarterback Bryant Ken-
drick and a determined defensive
unit, the freshman Brigadier Gen-
erals defeated Bridgewater JV, 14-0,
last Friday on Wilson Field.

A large crowd of parents and
Turkey-trotting freshmen saw a
close, hard-hitting game, filled with
fumbles by both teams. The first
Washington and Lee score came in
the second period on a 20-yard pass
from Kendrick to Hank Hendrick-
son in the end zone. The play was
set up by an eleven-yard pickup
on a quarterback sneak by Ken-
drick on a third-and eight situation.
Bob Reading added the extra point
and the score was 7-0.

Fine Defense

In the second half the fine defen-
sive play of Warren Stuart, Bob
Reading and Logie, Bullitt, defen-
sive tackles, plus the efforts of line-
backers Bill Sledge and Chuck
Staples, allowed only one first down
and 30 yards for a game total of
44 yards total offense by Bridge-
water.

The final score was set up by a
40 yard punt return by Phil Claxton
to the Bridgewater 14-yard line,
where John Bogart bulled his way
to the one. Kendrick then scored
on a quarterback sneak. After a
penalty nullified the first extra point
try, Reading calmly booted another
extra point from the 17-yard line.

Line Praised

Coach Swan singled out the de-
fensive line for their fine perfor-
mance as well as backs Rodger Red-
man, Jim Oram, and John Graham.
Swan said, “The team worked hard
all week in practice and it showed
up in the game.”

The Brigadiers have an open date
this week and they play Randolph-
Macon Academy on November 9.

Student Searching For Change

Finds Everything

(Continued from page 2)
izing what was before is important
to consider, especially when you
realize that (perhaps a wee tiny
bit erroneously) W&L’s reputation
in the past as a training ground for
A.A. All-Stars has been puffed up.

“After the war the boys that
came back were naturally very
serious about doing their work,
but they were hardly any better
informed than our students now,”
said the dean of admissions, In-
stead of an actual change in the
student, he seemed to feel that the
school had changed. He pointed
out that the school was harder;
it was easier to flunk out; and
once out, it was almost impossible
to get into another good school.

He felt that all these things were
impressed on the students today
and that they reacted by putting
more time into their studies. The

Later in the same period with
H-SC driving again on the General
25-yard line, fine play by Wé&L’s
defensive linemen, Jim Silvester,
John Anthony, and Buck Ogilvie
dropped the Tigers for several long
losses. With third and 29, Anthony
jarred the passer, Lipscomb, just as
he was about to throw the ball,
Ogilvie picked off the free ball and
ran untouched 50 yards to paydirt.
Sackett added the two-point conver-
sion with an end-run to give Wash-
ington and Lee an 11-0 half time
edge.

In the third quarter, the Generals
mounted several long drives but each
time failed to succeed in scoring.
Lipscomb began H-SC’s first drive
late in the third period, after having
one potential thrust thwarted when
David picked off a Tiger aerial in
the endzone and ra nit to the Gener-
al’s own 40 yard line.

curriculum is simply not allowing
“party boys” to develop.

With caution Dean Farrar added,
“Let’s not forget though, that seri-
ousnes does not necessarily mean
parking over a cup of coffee and
discussing Camus until two o’clock
in the morning.” C’est vrai.

On confronting Dr. Leyburn with
the problem, I found that he was
much in agreement with Dean Far-
rar as to this topic. He remarked
again on the seriousness of the post-
war students, but honestly felt that
the students seemed the same as
far as intellectual pursuits went.
The standard of work has improved
and accordingly, the student has im-
proved his work.

When Dr. Leyburn got around to
commenting that even the articles
and issues in the Ring-tum Phi have
not changed much with the years,
I thought it time to leave. It was
important though, to note how the
views of Dr. Leyburn and Dean
Farrar coincided on this subject.

Bill Noell complained upon be-
ing approached that his almost
three and one-half years here
hardly gave him the perspective
to discuss a topic on a changing
student body. He was not lack-
ing of thoughts on the subject
though. He said that he felt that
there was a change in the com-
plexion of Freshmen Classes the
school was getting now. This plus
the added pressure of the higher
academic standards was changing
the outlook of the whole student
body. It was a combination of the
two forces.

“I believe that pereentage wise

there are an increasingly greater
number of boys in the Freshman
Class that can carry on an intellect-
ual discussion. Of course, they may
hesitate to, but they have the abil-
ity.”
So that is how the interviews went.
I attempted to comment personally,
but remembering the hesitancy even
“the authorities” showed, I had bet-
ter get back to the intellectual bull
sessions on B.V. Becky and the
girls.

with the victory and the fine show-

it would be difficult to single out any

did mention as having played an
outstanding game were fullback
David Redmond, Jackson, Berthel-
sen, and Kirkpatrick. Others in evi-
dence were Preston and Hornor. The
Generals next take on American

mative case, the negative side
brought out their own argument.
They countered by saying that Jef-
ferson was similar to Lee. Eckes
maintained that Jefferson was re-
sponsible for the foundation of the
United States; therefore, if he were
to be tried, so would almost all
America. Clark brought out the
point that Jefferson was a peace-
maker, who had the ability to
change, and that his ideas would
be adaptable today, although Jeffer-
son would be critical of our pres-
ent system. The negative stressed
that Jefferson would be respected
and followed if he were alive today.

Stewart called “the best Parents’

ago. Last year they joined the Sen-
sations, a colored singing group
from town and began to work as one
group. Their present manager is
Roger Paine. The students in the
combo are Erik Anderson, lead sax-
ophone; Blaine Brownell, bass
guitar; Dudley Henckles, lead guitar;
Bill Ingles, rhythm guitar; and Jay
Fiedler, drums.

The Waysiders are Jim Ledbetter
and Dave Trussel. They are the
most recently formed of the groups
and only began playing together last
January. Their taste in folk music
leans toward exciting songs with a
hard driving beat. Their reportoire
is drawn most from their own re-
search, and their songs are not mere
copies of the big name _ groups.
Ledbetter has written a few of their
songs himself.

all present wives and those coming to
Hillside Terrace and Davidson Park
in the future, so that they might
have some idea of the generally ac-
cepted and most popular stores of
every category in town.

No such benefit has been offered
to incoming students’ wives in the
past and they have had to rely either
on friends already here, or on the
“hit and miss” basis, to determine
which merchants they wished to
patronize.

Mixed opinions about several
stores were one of the results of the
survey. At present, the concern is
to make any final booklet an objec-
tive and fair summary of the relative
merits of those business concerns
dealt with in the poll. Mrs. Paine
hopes that the final booklet can be
distributed through the office of Mr.
H. L. Ravenhort, who directs the
selection of housing for married stu-
dents who wish to live at Hillside
Terrace or Davidson Park.

Percentage of Failures

When a mother asked the profes-
sors what percentage of freshmen
at W&L failed the English course,
they answered it was very small. Dr.
Coulling pointed out that at a large
state university, the percentage of
failures was from 30 to 35 per cent.
Providing a good part of the comic
relief for the evening, Dr. Coulling
concluded with an anecdote from
his own teaching experience: a stu-
dent of his at a state university was
arguing with him about a point of
grammar. Dr. Coulling finally ob-
jected to the student’s argument on
the basis that he had been teaching
the course for three years, and ought
to know what was right and what
was wrong. The student merely gave
him a deadpan look and replied:
“That's nothing—I've been taking
this course for six years.”

to receive unanimous approval.
Friday’s cocktail party and dance
drew eighteen of the forty-two
freshmen polled. The cocktail party
was widely enjoyed, but the dance
received the affection of only half of
the eighteen who attend it.

A question of a more general na-
ture was asked: “Did you enjoy the
weekend as a whole?” Thirty-two
said they did, while ten were not
so pleased with it. Twenty-six of
the total felt the weekend lived up
to their expectations, and sixteen
felt it did not.

During these interviews many
freshmen expressed the feeling that
either the weekend was what one
made of it, or else it was what one’s
date made of it. Most of the fresh-
men seemed to have spent an en-
joyable weekend—those who didn’t
were explicit in describing its faults.

a shame that with such a good and exciting wrestling team only
a relatively few people ever come to the matches.
This school is the only one in the south with more than
1,000 students and no band. The pep-band is terrific, but will
probably fold for lack of enthusiasm after this year. This is
something that will have to originate mostly from the adminis-
tration, but the W&L student has shown interest in such things
as debating and singing, why not try a band too???
You could probably find someone crazy (or drunk)
enough enough to dress up as a General and be a mascot dur-
ing W&L home contests. Granted, it’s harder to be a Gen-
eral than it would be to dress like a Tiger or a Bear, but it might
be worth trying.

HOW SMALL CAN YOU GET?

Today let us address ourselves to a question that has long rocked
and roiled the academic world: Is a student better off at a small
college than at a large college?

To answer this question it is necessary first to define terms.
What, exactly, do we mean by a small college? Well sir, some
say that in order to be called truly small, a college should have
an enrollment of not more than four students.

I surely have no quarrel with this statement; a four-student
college must unequivocally be called small. Indeed, I would
even call it intime if I knew what intime meant. But I submit
there is such a thing as being too small. Take, for instance, a
recent unfortunate event at Crimscott A and M.

Crimscott A and M, situated in a pleasant valley nestled
between Philadelphia and Salt Lake City, was founded by

   

= ee

emall allesé ?
A. and M. Crimscott, two brothers who left Ireland in 1625
to escape the potato famine of 1841. As a result of their fore-
sight, the Crimscott brothers never went without potatoes for
one single day of their lives—and mighty grateful they were!
One night, full of gratitude after a wholesome meal of French
fries, cottage fries, hash browns, and au gratin, they decided
to show their appreciation to this bountiful land of potatoes
by endowing a college. But their generosity contained one
stipulation: the enrollment of the college must never exceed
four students. They felt that only by keeping the school this
small could each student be assured of the personalized atten-
tion, the camaraderie, the esprit, that is all too often lacking in
larger institutions of higher learning.

Well sir, things went along swimmingly until one Saturday
a few years ago. On this day Crimscott had a football game
scheduled against Minnesota, its traditional rival. Football,
as you can well imagine, was something of a problem at Crim-
scott, what with only four undergraduates in the entire college.
It was easy enough to muster a backfield, but to find a good
line—or even a bad line—baffled some of the most resourceful
coaching minds in the nation.

Well sir, on the morning of the big game against Minnesota,
its traditional rival, a capricious fate dealt Crimscott a cruel
blow—in fact, four cruel blows. Sigafoos, the quarterback,
woke up that morning with an impacted incisor. Wrichards,
the slotback, flunked his taxidermy exam and was declared in-
eligible. Beerbohm-Tree, the wingback-tailback, got his neck-
tie caught in his espresso machine. Yuld, the fullback, was
stolen by gypsies.

Consequently, none of the Crimscott team showed up at the
football game, and Minnesota, its traditional rival, was able to
score almost at will. Crimscott was so cross after this humiliating
defeat that they immediately broke off football relations with
Minnesota, its tradtional rival. This later became known as
the Sacco-Vanzetti Case.

So you can see how only four students might be too meagre
an enrollment. The number that I personally favor is twenty.
Why? you ask. Because, I reply, when you have twenty
students and one of them opens a pack of Marlboro Cigarettes,
there are enough to go around for everybody, and no one has
to be deprived of Marlboro’s flavor, of Marlboro’s filter, of
Marlboro’s staunch and steadfast companionship, and as a
result you have a student body that is brimming with sweet
content and amity and harmony and concord and togetherness
and soft pack and Flip-Top box.

That’s why.

chief. At left are Lt. Col. Jack P. Burch, head of the W&L ROTC Depart-
ment, and Dr. Fred C. Cole, university president.

Bronze Star Medal Awarded
To Horwedel, ROTC Instructor

Captain Alan T. Horwedel, new assistant professor of
military science, has been presented with the U.S. Army’s

Bronze Star Medal.

Colonel Raymond B. Steiner, Chief of the ROTC branch
of the Second Army, recently bestowed the Medal upon

Captain Horwedel in President

P. Burch, head of the ROTC De-
partment at W&L, were present at
the ceremony.

The medal was awarded for “mer-
itous achievement in ground opera-
tions against hostile forces in the
Republic of Vietnam.” Captain Hor-
wedel had been stationed in Vietnam
for eleven months during 1962-1963,
as the advisor to the First Battalion
of 48th Infantry Regiment of the
Vietnamese Army.

The citation that came with the
Medal stated that Captain Horwedel’s
“conduct under hostile fire and
during extreme hardships in the
field served as a continuing inspira-
tion for the soldiers he advised.”

Captain Horwedel graduated from
West Point and was commissioned
an officer in 1953. He had previously
served as an enlisted man from
1947 to 1949.

A native of Columbus, Ohio, Capt.
Horwedel is 33 years old. His eleven
months in Vietnam were from May
1962 until last April.

Capt. Horwedel came to Washing-
ton and Lee at the start of the cur-
rent academic year.

dedicates the Adrian L. Bendheim,
Jr. Physics Library.

Located in the University’s new
building for physics and biology,
the library is a gift of the family
and friends of the late Mr. Bend-
heim, a 1942 graduate of Washing-
ton and Lee.

During the brief public ceremony,
Mr. Richard Bendheim of Richmond,
on behalf of the family and friends,
will present the University with a
portrait of the late Mr. Bendheim to
hang in the library.

Also participating in the dedica-
tion will be University President
Fred C. Cole, physics department
head Dr. Edward F. Turner, Jdr.,
and University chaplain Dr. David
W. Sprunt. President Cole said he
hopes Mr. Bendheim’s former facul-
ty associates and many _ other
friends will join the Bendheim fam-
ily at the 11:30 a.m. ceremony.

Prior to his death on July 25,
1959, Mr. Bendheim was active in
alumni leadership of a fund cam-
paign to provide improved facilities
for science instruction and research
at Washington and Lee. The new
facilities realized through the cam-
paign were placed in service in 1962.

Mr. Benheim, who was 37 when
struck and killed by lightning while
fishing at Virginia Beach, was a
former president of the University’s
Richmond alumni chapter.

He was active in the real estate
business, and the Real Estate Board
of Richmond now awards the Ad-
rian Bendheim, Jr., Award annually
to the city’s outstanding real estate
salesman.

Law Freshmen
Elect Bowie
As EC Member

Freshman law class elections re-
sulted in an overwhelming vote for
Jime Bowie as Executive Commit-
teeman. Ray Vizethann was elected
president of the freshman law class.

Other new officers are W. Court
Soloff (vice-president; Sam Cole-
man, secretary; and Dave Streetman,
historian.

Bowie, a Phi Kap, is married and
has three children. He entered the
Washington and Lee Law School
during the last semester of the 1962-
63 school year. Bowie graduated
from W&L in 1956 but decided not
to continue his education at the
time and went to work for Burling-
ton Industries on a sales and ad-
ministration training program. Since
returning to Washington and Lee as
a law student in February, 1963, he
has maintained an “A” average. In
the realm of extracurricular activi-
ties he is writing for the Law Re-
view, working in McCormick Law
Library, and is in the process of
becoming a book agent for the law
school. Furthermore, Bowie has been
chosen for the Mock Trial in No-
vember. In order to supplement his
income, he has set up a concession
in the basement of Tucker Hall, and
is often found selling tickets to var-
sity games. Jim also recently be-
came a member of the legal fraterni-
ty, Phi Delta Phi.

The newly elected president of
the freshman law class, Ray Vize-
thann, was graduated from Colgate
in the class of ’59. He then entered
the Navy Officers Candidate School,
acquiring special training in under-
water demolition. After the com-
pletion of this course, he was as-
signed to the Evplosive Ordnance
Disposal Corp in Hawaii, command-
ing a team of frogmen.

The new vice-president of the
freshman law class, Court Soloff, is a
graduate of Roanoke college where
he was elected president of the stu-
dent body in his senior year. Court
was also inducted into the Blue Key
honorary society and Who’s Who in
American Colleges and Universities
while at Roanoke College. Futher-
more, Soloff was president of his
fraternity, Pi Kappa Phi, and on
the Honor Council, an organization
comparable to our Executive Com-
mittee. Soloff is from Northfield, New
Jersey, and is engaged to an Ameri-
can Airline hostess.

Independent

By DEXTER FOLLOWILL

The Independent Union, at its first
regular meeting Wednesday night,
discussed the possibility of renting
a building or a large apartment for
the purpose of providing non-fra-
ternity students a meeting place.

This meeting place would be used
as a location for social activities
also. It would furnish a recreation
hall and a study area as well as
basic kitchen appliances.

Although still in the formative
stages the idea was greeted with
almost unanimous approval. The
Student Union facilities, limited by
size and University regulations,
prove to be inadequate for the ex-
pending Independent Union. There-
fore, an investigation is planned to
provide a concrete proposal, which
will be presented for the considera-
tion of the members of the Union
at some future meeting. At that
time a proposed budget for the fur-
nishing and maintainence of the site
will also be offered.

Dean Atwood has sanctioned these
preliminary plans submitted to him
by the Steering Committee.

Another item of busines of the
meeting was the discussion of future
plans for intramural participation
in bowling, handball, and basket-
ball.

The primary purpose of the as-
sembly was the election of the mem-
bers of the Steering Committee,
the executive branch of the Union.
In order to provide proportional
representation from each of the
four classes, it was decided that
three members from the freshman
class, two from the sophomore, and
one each from the junior and senior
classes would be included on this
committee.

Those elected to represent the
freshman class were Bob Radcliffe,
Randy Nunn and Dick Masters. Lew
Davis and Neil Houghton will rep-
resent the ‘sophomore, Shannon

A short meeting of the Steering
Committee was held after the regu-
lar meeting. Plans for further ac-
tivities were formulated.

Last year’s political upheaval mo-
tivated the formation of the group
which has extended its activities in-
to the social and athletic fields of
W&L. In the Big Four election, in
addition to the freshman E.C. elec-
tion, individual candidates backed
by the Union have been suc-essful.
These candidates were supported on
the basis of their personal qualitica-
tions as opposed to their political
affiliation.

Holmes Speaks
Here Tuesday

Dr. U. T. Holmes, Kenan profes-
sor of romance philosophy at the
University of North Carolina, will
speak Tuesday (Nov. 5) at Wash-
ington and Lee for the initial pro-
gram of the 1963-64 Seminar in
Literature series.

His public talk on “French Ro-
mances as an Early Novelistic Form”
will be at 6:15 p.m. in duPont Audi-
torium. Dr. Holmes’ appearance will
mark Washington and Lee’s 46th
Seminar in Literature program. The
series was inaugurated at the Uni-
versity in the early 1950's.

A member of the UNC faculty
since 1925 and a full professor there
since 1927, Dr. Holmes was named
Kenan professor at North Carolina
in 1945. He taught at the University
of Missouri from 1923 to 1925. He
received his M.A. and Ph.D. de-
grees from Harvard University.

Fancy Dress V ice-prestdents
Are Appointed By Wootton

Randy Wootton, president
of Fancy Dress, announced his
vice-presidents last night along
with a surprise change in the
schedule of events.

The six vice-presidents are:
Jim DeYoung, Phi Kap, in charge of
decorations; A. J. Barranco, SAE,
in charge of the cocktail party; Fred
Cooper, Pi Phi, in charge of the
figure; Buck Ogilvie, Beta, in charge
of coordination, Mark Gee, Sigma
Chi, in charge of invitations; and
Ken Lane, Phi Delt.

Change in Schedule

Wootton, a Phi Delt, also an-
nounced that the concert will be
Saturday afternoon instead of Sat-
urday night. This change in the cus-
tomary schedule will prevent the
necessity of fraternities having to
start their combo parties late Sat-
urday night, Wootton commented.

The theme of Friday night’s dance
will be the Mardi Gras. The con-
cert Saturday will be presented with
“New Orleans” as the setting.

Wootton stated that he was very
pleased with the caliber of his
vice-presidents. “They represent a
good cross-section of student lead-
ers,” he remarked.

DeYoung, a junior, was a vice-
president of last year’s Fancy Dress.
He is captain of the tennis team,
president of his fraternity, a mem-
ber of the Varsity Club and of
SWMSFC, and a state chairman
for the Mock Convention.

Barranco, a senior is a dormitory
counselor, vice-president of the
Commerce Fraternity, a member of
varsity football, and a state chair-
man for the Mock Convention.

Cooper, a senior, is vice-president
of the IFC, a member of the As-
similation Committee, and a “char-
ter member of the Gauley Bridge
Hunt Club.” In addition, he is on
the ODK leadership Steering Com-
mittee, a freshman camp counselor,
and secretary-treasurer of the Uni-

 

alties,

versity party.

 

Ogilvie, a senior, is a member of
the Executive Committee, is a co-
captain of the football team, and a
dormitory counselor. He is a mem-
ber of SWMSFC and Phi Eta Sigma,
and has received an award as out-
standing MS-1 Cadet. He is a mem-
ber of ODK.

Gee, a junior, is a member of
the Glee Club, Sazeracs, SWMSFC,
assistant rush chairman of his fra-
ternity, and a member of the IFC

Lane, a senior, is editor of the
Friday Ring-tum Phi, senior class
president, president of his frater-
nity, and president of the Student
Service Society.

Entertainment

Entertainment for the dance and
concert is still tentative and an-
nouncements will be made in the
near future.

Wootton added that the costumes
will be approximately five dollars
less per person this year although
it will not be required, dates may
wear costumes also.

Freshmen Hold
Debate Tourney

By COLEMAN BRYDON

The results of last week’s Novice
Debate Tournament sponsored by
the W&L Forensic Union were an-
nounced today by Professor William
Chaffin.

Individual winners were: Bill Tor-
rey in first place with the high score
of 57 points out of a possible 75,
Harold Nase in second place with
48 points, and Rowland Greenwade
with 47 points; all debating the
proposition affirmatively. High men
debating the issue negatively were:
John Zink with 55 points, Bill Her-
man with 47 points, and Tom Leg-
gett, 45 points.

The winning team was, for the
negative, that of Zink and Herman,
who formed the only undefeated
team in the tournament, and for
the affirmative, that of Fred Bishop
and Harold Nase, who compiled a 2-1
record, losing only to Zink and
Herman.

The tournament was made up of
twelve participants, divided up into
three affirmative and three negative
teams. Others taking part were, John
V. Czyzewski and Charles R. Chit-
tum for the affirmative and Neely
Young, Richard T. Moss, and Wil-
liam S. Hummers, III, for the neg-
ative. The tournament was held
as a Round-Robin affair with each
participant having a different part-
ner for each debate. The subject
for the debate was the National
Debate Topic for this year, concern-
ing the responsibility of the feder-
al government in providing highter
education for qualified high school
graduates.

The debaters were judged on five
main points. The first of these was
their analysis of the opponents’
argument. The second was the reas-
oning in their speeches. Added to
this, however, was also the evidence
which they produced to back up
their arguments. They were graded
on how they organized their ma-
terial in their speeches, and also in
their refutations. Finally, their man-
ner of presentation was judged as
to effectiveness and organization.

Also last week, eight students
took part in a debate held at Bridge-
water College. Those who took part
were: Lin Hartin, Nauman Scott,
Bob Lohman, and Billy Cannon de-
bating the affirmative, and Mike Na-
tion, Jeff Gayor, John Hensley, and
Roy Powell composed the negative
teams. Coach Chaffiin said this week
has been the most active week in
forensic program in four years, as
far as the number of people involved
is concerned. With another pair of
teams consisting of Chuck Levy,
Allen Cohen, Michael Fowler, and
Tyree Harris (all picked because
of extensive high school experience)
going to Wake Forest this weekend,
a total of twenty-four students have
debated this week. Already, this
year, thirty-two students have been
exposed to debating, and this num-
ber will increase in the next weeks.

The Void

Tuesday’s editorial focus on the “Old Co-op” brings to
mind a very pressing need—that of an ideally located, on-
campus recreation center, something the University has lacked
ever since the campus Co-op was transferred to the Student
Union.

The present Co-op is particularly lacking in two respects.
The first is its location: it is out of the way of general traffic;
there are no parking facilities; it is far enough away from the
library and the dorms so that students would just as soon use
the freshman dorm cookie room as walk the extra distance.

Secondly, the present Co-op lacks any sort of atmosphere.
No attempt at all is made to give the place some personality,
and this explains why students prefer Doc’s and the College
Inn when they want a break.

Studnts are increasingly aware of a centrifugal pull exerted
on the W&L community. This void in our recreational facili-
ties helps to contribute to this pull. Between classes or during
idle moments, there is no suitable place to go except the fra-
ternity house. It is no wonder that alumni, on recalling the
happy hours of conversation and good fellowship at the old
Co-op, are amazed that we can exist without such a common
meeting place.

The old Co-op has not as yet been designated for any par-
ticular use. It has been suggested that both the basement and
the ground floor could be fixed up, with ping-pong and pool
tables, pin ball machines, juke box, and snack bar installed.
Such a set-up would be ideal for our needs. The cost (estimates
are at $20,000) would not exceed the amount necessary to
renovate the building for any other use. Perhaps if nothing
else avails, we can appeal to the alumni and friends in a “back

 

to the old Co-op” drive.

 

Brothel Used Symbolically :
In Genet’s “The Balcony”

By BOB MOTTLEY
Friday Columnist

Admirers of Alain Resnais (Who
directed Hiroshima, Mon Amour and
Last Year at Marienbad will be
happy to know of
his third major
mystical endeavor,
Muriel, which had
its New York pre-
miere this past
week. Critical re-
action was mixed;
like Marienbad
this film is so sub-
jective that one
takes frum it only
what one can
bring to it, not en-
tirely a bad principle.

Viewers of Genet’s The Balcony
will find themselves in a similar
quandary, particularly if they expect
raw sex. There is quite a bit of
lewdness going around, but the dirt
is cleverly buried in a heady brew
of philosophy. I strongly recommend
it for all members of the Assimila-
tion Committee, that they may veri-
ly see the effects of illusion.

The World a Brothel

A rough outline of the problems
at hand may be helpful: the first
brothel is seen by Genet to have
been a temple, Albee’s Earth Moth-
er (see Va. Woolf) was the first
deity to be worshipped by emerg-
ing homo sapiens in the person of a
sacred prostitute. (At least, they
weren't being hypocritical!) The
ritual was simple: one entered
the “temple,” paid one’s homage
in that good old fashioned way,
and received from the local rep-
resentative of Mumsey a tempor-
ary escape from the problems of
the day. Genet updates this fetching
concept by assuming (for The Bal-
cony, at least) that the world is
a great brothel operated by an eter-
nal Madam who is both Mumsey and
Irma ( La Douce—who else?)—she
sells her customers illusion for the

   

Mottley

When the check bounces—eventual-
ly—so does the customer—back into
ithe cold, cruel world.

This sort of thing obviously isn’t
approved by the League of National
Decency, but remember that we are
very much in the theater of the
Absurd, where to be decent is to be
normal, and hence—an outcast. As
The Balcony commences, society is
crumbling but prostitution is doing
a roaring business. Mumsey’s whore-
house is divided into separate cham-
bers of illusion. The first is a hall
of justice for masochists (a must for
all lawyers), the second a chapel for
the confessions of prostitutes, and
Time inimitably describes the third
as a “stable” where a milkman pur-
chases the illusion that he is a ca-
valry (not calvary) general and
prepares to mount his whorse.”

In Genet’s original play, those
rebelling against the Grand Dames
won out, and the ringleader con-
summates his marriage to the Earth
Mother by castrating himself. This
is a trifle strong even for Holly-
wood, and is so deleted in the film.
(You might keep it in mind as a
sort of comforting thought.)

Shelly Winters

Now to mundane matters of tech-
nique. Director Joseph Strick does
not, strictly speaking, confine him-
self to Genet’s erotic text. The
lines are sticky in places, but not
really as poetically gross as in the
original script. Still, not all of
Genet’s macabre mockery has been
done in, and enough remains to pro-
vide a stimulating evening. I rather
liked Shelly Winters’ performance
as the Madam: many have not. She
brings a certain dramatic “I-could-
care-less”-ness that comes after five
(or so) six-packs. If you really want
to think you understand The Bal-
cony, don’t show up sober. If you
are “there” sufficiently to notice de-
tails, the whole production may
seem a bit shaggy and frazzled. This
is because it was shot in Hollywood

 

currency of their sexual potency.

Fraternities Under Attack

 

(The Ring-tum Phi, in feeling
that the fraternity system is un-
dergoing a critical transition, has
enlisted reporter Warren Mont-
gomery to study and evaluate the
present status of fraternities in to-
days colleges and _ universities.
Following is the first in a series of
four articles.

By WARREN MONTGOMERY

“Isn’t it time that the American
university prepared a decent burial
for the traditional American college
fraternity? They have served an
historical purpose and served it well.
But we’ve given up banjo clubs and
minstrels. Now it’s time to face
courageously the task of replacing
the alumni-dominated fraternal sys-
tem.”

This remark by President Edward
D. Eddy of Chatham College typi-
fies the general attitude of many

 

of today’s educators, intellectuals,
and students on the collegiate fra-
ternity system. In colleges through-
out the nation, and especially in
the Eastern schools, fraternities are
under attack on charges including
academic failure, inadequate hous-
ing, inhumane hazing practices, gen-
eral uselessness, and racism.

Though the campaign against fra-
ternities, conducted by individual
college administrations and by stu-
dent opinion, is not very manifest,
its results are. Recent publications
have frequently commented on the
effects of this movement:

Snobbism and Hell-raising
“The traditional image of the fra-
ternity of the 1920’s, rooted in
snobbism and hell-raising, is crumb-
ling in the face of spreaded sophis-
tication and intellectual seriousness
on most U.S. campuses. Youngsters

 

are beginning to snipe at reaction-
ary leadership in the national or-
ganizations...at many schools the
actual prestige of fraternities seems
to be gradually withering.”

This same article, (Newsweek,
March 27, 1961) goes on to say that
traditions like “solemn rituals by
candlelight, heavily laced with cere-
mony...Frantic hazing calculated
to make boys into men... Whoop-
‘em-up parties designed to enhance
a sense of brotherhood...” are fad-
ing out of the fraternity scene.

Pseudo-solemnities

Other publications are more vir-
ulent. The Christian Century asks,
“What does the indignity of frater-
nity initiations do to the dignity of
man?” (One might doubt that this
writer has ever experienced an ini-
tiation, and if so, he is making rash
generalizations on the basis of his

 

 

The most recent sign of progress on campus is the restoration of the Memorial Gates at the parking lot entrance.
The gates were given in memory of those students who died during World War I. (Photo by Caro).

 

A Review

By BILL CHAPLIN
The American Way of Death. By
Jessica Mitford (New York, Si-
mon and Schuster, 1963).

Jessica Mitford’s beautifully writ-
ten, brilliantly documented, and
vivid examination of the American
funeral industry makes Evelyn
Waugh’s The Loved One, a satiri-
cal novel published in the thirties
with the same theme, seem like
Red Riding Hood in comparison to
the Wolf. Her purpose, unlike
Waugh’s, is to let the industry satir-
ize, and hopefully hang, itself by
giving it an open forum in her
book. It is a mock-forum, of course,
and one presided over by Miss Mit-
ford with consummate artistry and
sardonic detachment. She quotes
Howard C. Raether, executive sec-
retary of the National Funeral Di-
rector’s Association, for her perfa-
tory remark: neatly and hilariously
he says, “Funerals are becoming
more and more a part of the Amer-
ican way of life.”

Like other American institutions,
the funeral industry has grown to
bizzarre and disturbing propor-
tions, creating pseudo-events and
administering to needs which are
themselves artificially created; thus
it has grown, with all of its jargon
and trade publications and fake tra-
ditions, beyond the reach of satire.
I can imagine Swift confronted with
the problem of turning the meaning
of this ludicrous and deadly-serious
business back upon itself, and I can
imagine him failing. For the industry
satirizes itself, in its commercialism
and gaudy ostentation, and with its
tricks and big-time organizational
aspects. Its language (which Miss
Mitford captures with ease and dev-
astation) fills somber little trade
publications such as Casket and
Sunnyside and Concept: The Journal
of Creative Ideas for Cemeteries. It
is bald, trite, and self-incriminating:
“A funeral is not an occasion for
the display of cheapness. It is an op-
portunity for the display of a
status-symbol which, by bolstering
family pride, does much to assuage
grief,”

The reader of these journals
which Miss Mitford brings to ac-
count must also believe that other
inventions of the funeral indus-

Memory Pictures, the
Crypt, the Memorial Counselor,
and (best of all) the Grief Therap-
ist attempt to ‘assuage grief” with
a variety of mumbo-jumbo, Marble
temples, and visions of economical
beauty.

It is not, of course, economical
to be buried these days. The average
cost of the funeral of every adult in
1961 was $1,450—somewhat more
than the cost of the pine wood
casket and family burial of the last
century. A salesman for a cremator-
ium might persuade you to place
the remains of “the loved one” in
an outdoor crypt, emphasizing that
“it’s all a part of the trend toward
outdoor living.” If you still want to
be buried, though, and you live in
southern California, then you might
be accommodated in “Forest-Lawn
Memorial-Park,” “where, as Miss
Mitford explains, “each section is
zoned and named according to the
price of burial plots. Medium priced
graves range from $434.50 in Haven
of Peace to $599.50 in Triumphant
Faith to $649.50 in Ascension. The
cheapest is $308, in Brotherly Love—

be added to the price for Endow-
ment Care,” and so on. But for those
“wishing something better (such as
the Gardens of Memory, kept locked
to the public but to which the prop-
erty owner is given a Golden Key)

The amount of Miss Mitford’s
research is astonishing. One of the
most interesting and provocative
accounts which she gives con-
cerns the funeral of President
Franklin D. Roosevelt, who died
late in the century, perhaps, to
be buried as he explicitly wanted
to be—with simplicity and dignity.
She constructs a dialogue be-
tween what Roosevelt stipulated
and what an observer of the fun-
eral reported:

R: “... the body be not embalmed.”

O:“All three assistants worked
incessantly five hours to give the
president the proper appearance, and
to be certain of proper preserva-
tion...the tissues were firm, com-
plexion was fine and those who saw
him remarked, ‘He looks like his

When Freddy walked into his ad-
visor’s office last week he found,
to his great dis-
| may, that he had
one more U than
he had expected.
Angered. and
| broken up about
this nasty break,
he proceeded to
tell his advisor of
how the evil fra-
ternities had taken
up all of his time
with house work
and rallies.

After Homecomings, Openings, and
Parents Weekend are over, Freddy
Freshman realizes and remembers
what he is really here for. Every
year these same objections are heard
from the hapless pledges. Two years
ago the IFC took steps to remedy
the situation and abolish Hell Week.
Last year it was generally agreed
that things had changed. Most hous-
es had a policy of three hours a
week for housework and maybe one
rally every four or five weeks. Some
houses completely did away with all
“hell” activities.

There isn’t a student in school
who couldn’t spare three hours a
week to do something for his house.
An hour rally once every four
weeks is not too demanding either.
The good students are not going to
let pledging interfere with their
grades; they will merely cut out
three hours of time they would spend

 

 

doing something else. The weaker

Can Today’s Fraternity System Survive?

own experience). The magazine fur-
ther charges that nationals force
“ridiculous . . . pseudo-solemnities”
and “discriminatory clauses” on their
chapters.

Time, quoting Dr. Eddy again, says
that the fraternity system “has
failed to adapt itself to the de-
mands of the new student and to
a changing social pattern. The sys-
tem .. . should be replaced . .
with intellectual centers.”

Hard Work and Privacy

According to some authorities, stu-
dent participation in fraternal activi-
ty is decreasing. Dean George Grif-
fin at Georgia Tech has stated:
“We have students here who don’t
care whether they belong or not.
They have to work too hard.”

Walter Rea, Dean of Men at Mich-
igan, feels that “among students
here, there’s a growing feeling for
privacy. Fraternities are losing many
to apartment living.”

A committee of Brown University
undergraduates reports: “From with-
in the fraternities comes mounting
criticism of the process of rushing
and pressures which mold individ-
uals to the pattern of the group.”

Fraternities in Trouble

Perhaps the adverse fraternal sit-
uation depicted by recent publica-
tions can be taken with a grain of
salt, for journalism is not above
holding up one side of a picture to
the public. Nevertheless, there is no
doubt but that fraternities are deep
in trouble. Membership is dropping
off, as perhaps was demonstrated by
the results of W&L’s 1963 rush week.
Many schools, such as Brown and
Duke, regulate fraternities to school
housing—or glorified dorms—and
others have taken over the task
of feeding the entire student body.
In other institutions, such as W&L,
relatively mild action has been taken
in the form of changing Hell Week
to “Help” Week and by requiring
minimum grade standards for ini-
tiation.

“Frat-frying Williams”

The most glaring result of the
anti-fraternity trend is the total abo-
lition of the fraternity system at
Williams College. “Frat-frying Wil-
liams,” as one national fraternity
publication put it, assumed all of the
social, feeding, and housing func-
tions of its fifteen fraternities, which
were in effect liquidated. The reason
given by the Williams administration
for its action was that “Fraternities
have come to exercise a dispropor-
tionate role in undergraduate life.”

Student Apathy

Possibly the most significant as-
pect of the decline of the fraterni-
ties is that the movement has the
support, or at least the acquiescence,
of the students involved, including
the fraternity members themselves.
In places like Yale, chapters are
collapsing under the weight of sheer
apathy.

It is clear, then, that unless under-

(Continued on page 4)

Pledge Work Is Bearable,
Baur Tells The Freshmen

students will use pledging as an ex-
cuse for their own inadequacies.

Grow up Freddy. You have had
your dates bit; you have been on
both ends of a dump job; you have
gotten a few drunken parties in.
Now it is time to show what a
big boy you really are. You will
have work pile up on you in the
next three months; see close
friends fail out; have an unhappy
friend transfer. Stop your com-
plaining because you are only
hurting yourself. If you can’t be a
member of a fraternity and do
well at Washington and Lee, then
you shouldn’t be here. Now quit
alibing and get to work; at least
forty fraternity brothers and five
of your professors are pulling for
you.

Now that the Generals have lost
several games the criticism of the
schedule will probably stop. Un-
fortunately it never should have be-
gun. W&L has a good football team,
but even at our best we could not
play with highly subsidized schools
in the ACC or Southern Conference.

Any suggestion of better spirit at
games is welcome (cheerleaders,
drinking at game, band, etc.), but
any attack on either the schedule
or policy of the University can be
nothing but detremental to both the
team and the school.

F&M Boasts
‘New Look’

The injury total has reached sev-
en. This plus the fact Washington
and Lee must contend with a “re-
juvenated” Franklin and Marshall
team, could make things tough as
the Five Star Generals make their
second campaign into Pennsylvania
tomorrow.

Franklin & Marshall, hoping to
pull off the North’s biggest victory
since Gettysburg, is an old team
with a new look.

“They can’t be compared with the
same team we beat last season (Gen-
erals 57-FM 12), “said Coach Lee
McLaughlin. “Although they have
basically the same material we de-
feated last fall, they have a new
coach (George Storak) and, more
important, new enthusiasm.”

The Generals have been concen-
trating on pass defense this week.
“We'll need it. Franklin and Mar-
shall threw 42 passes last week
against Carneige Tech and com-
pleted a goodly percentage of them.
They really love to put the ball in
the air; in fact, they've almost aver-

aged two passes for every we

play they’ve executed.”

Coach Mac believes the Generals |
can stop the passing attack of F&M
with “a fast rush and some good ball
hawking in the secondary.”

The locals will not have senior
John Madison or halfback Harry
Brookby dressing. Madison was out
of last week’s game with Hampden-
Sydney. The headline proved a
bad omen as Madison pulled a ham-
string in the pregame warmup (no
offense please John!). Fullbacks
Syd Butler and John Anthony,
guards Bill Angel and Steve Daven-
port and quarterback Brice Gamber
will see only limited action.

Moving into the Generals starting
line-up, replacing Madison will be
Tersh Baker. The tough Baker
“could be the man to put the pres-
sure on the Franklin and Marshall
quarterback.” Other newcomers to
the starting team are guard Joe Mil-
ler, tackle Mike Jennings, and full-
back Dan Manson. Ball hawking
Bill David will move onto the Blue
team when F&M has the ball.

Don’t Jost Sit There; Express Yourself

By ROD COCKSHUTT
Friday Columnist

It still may be a little early to
suggest this, but things do seem to
be awfully quiet around here this
year; dull one might even say. I
mean, just last spring all sorts of
monumental issues—the quality of
food in the Commons, conventional
dress and the speaking tradition,
even the sanctity of the honor sys-
tem, once delivered to the saints—
were tossed around in heated debate.

Now all these ghosts have re-
turned to their graves for another
year, or so it seems. (There has
been some grumblings in the
ranks about the quality of enter-
tainment brought here by the
Dance Board, but from the looks
of things, that issue doesn’t have
much staying power.) Perhaps
then spring is the only time in

which young men’s fancies will
turn to something else besides
grades (not knowledge acquired),
the cost of combos, or the virgin
of the week.

Even then, though it still seems to
ingrown. As a rule, those issues and
problems which titillate the Wash-
ington and Lee Gentleman are so
relatively trivial that they are of
little or no importance or conse-
quence outside of Lexington.

Sad to say, the issues which are
determining the course of our na-
tion and our world—nuclear dis-
armament, racial problems, allied
diplomacy, the role of the federal
government in our society, the popu-
lation explosion, to name just a
few—are all too rarely discussed
in the editorial columns of the
Ring-tum Phi, or in the minute
number of letters to the respective
editors, or anywhere else, for that
matter.

As illogical and intemperate as they
may be at times, we can still admire
and be grateful for the Conservative
Society, and its organ, The South-
ern Conservative, and for the lonely
few individuals at the other end of
the political spectrum who have
enough faith in their philosophies to
write and speak about them—to try

to make us think outside the com-
fortable little worlds we've created
for ourselves here.

Perhaps we should hasten to add
that such complacency and lack
of concern seems to be the fate
of most colleges and universities
of Washington and Lee’s charac-
ter and disposition. Most of us,
both students and faculty, if we
are honest, will admit that it is all
too easy to glide merrily along,
day after day, without extraordi-
nary challenge to intellect or call
to substantial decision or commit-
ment.

Of course, this is a purely per-
sonal opinion, and as such I would
be the first to admit that it is liable
te error, prone to generalization.
But, obviously, I feel there’s a cer-
tain amount of truth in what I’ve
said as well. And it is this truth
that I find personally very discour-
agging. Do you?

GENERALS FACE FRANKLIN & MARSHALL

 

ISoccer, Cross-Country

Teams Meet

Washington and Lee soccer and
cross-country teams face tough op-
position Saturday when they travel
to American University in Wash-
ington. The harriers will compete
during half-time of the soccer game
scheduled to begin at 2:30 p.m.

Coach Howard Sorrell’s booters
take a 1-4-1 record against the Gen-
erals who have posted a 4-2 mark
this year. Saturday’s game could be
a duplicate of last year’s match
which ended in a 4-4 tie after seven
goals were scored during the last
three minutes of play.

Two of the three AU booters who
scored against the Generals last year
are back to try their luck again.
Center Ford Swartz and Wing Isaac
Heimbinder, who scored the tying
goal with 43 seconds remaining, are
definite starters for the Eagles Sat-
urday.

 

American U.

Washington and Lee will be de-
pending upon three mainstays—
seniors Jim Mell, a wing , Tom
Green, veteran goalie and Preben
Berthelsen, the Generals leading
scorer who will be a constant threat
to AU goalie Art Brodsky.

AU scoring leader Buddy Celt-
nieks will be looking for his fourth
goal of the season, after being shut
out in the Eagles 2-1 loss to How-
ard University last Saturday. AU
has now given up 11 goals in six
games, but has scored only 6 on
offense.

Coach Tom Evaul’s harriers, who
finished last in a fourway meet last
Saturday with Georgetown, William
and Mary, and St. Joseph’s will be
gunning for their third win of the
season. Fred Cheney and Ed Orem
will lead the Eagles against a fairly

' strong General lineup.

Letters To The Editor ...

 

 

Sir:

I write regarding Rod Cockshutt’s
comments in last Friday’s edition
on the ideological inconsistencies of
the right-wing.

Would that I could—with the same
blind irrationality of some in the
lunatic fringe of the rightist camp—
condemn his views as merely the
ravings of a misguided social re-
former!

However—much to the surprise of
some, I’m sure—I agree with him
at least insofar as he says there is
some inconsistency in the view
which says in the same breath that
the Supreme Court has “taken God
out of the schools’ ’and “put the

| niggers in.”

I wish only to point out here
that those people most emphatically
do not represent responsible, phil-
osophical conservatism. They are
many of us on the so-called “right-
wing” who realize quite well the
gravity of social problems like
prayer in public schools and the
rights of citizenship for Negroes.
Our quarrel with the “left-wing”
is over means—not ends.

My one direct criticism of Mr.
Cockshutt’s column is his derisive
attitude toward “America’s Chris-
tian Heritage”—“whatever that is,”
he says.

I commend to his attention the
writings of any of those great men
who helped mould the institutions
of this country. Almost to a man,
they were Christians in the broad-
est sense, even when not so in
a technical, orthodox sense. I also
suggest reflecting on our social and
economic structures, which seek
always to emphasize the primacy of
the individual.

These impel me to conclude that
our “Christian heritage” is not, af-
ter all, that hard to discern.

FACULTY ADOPTS NEW CUT PROPOSAL

‘Biedermann’ Premieres Tomorrow - 8:15

Dols, Mrs. Dickens Star
In Trcub Comic Allegory

By STEVE

COLVIN

Wednesday is opening night for the Troubadour Theatre’s
1963-64 Season. The first production will feature a comedy,

Biedermann and the Firebugs, b

y Swiss playwright Max Frisch.

Read by German classes at W&L last year, The Firebugs is a
comic allegory depicting a cowardly, rich, upper middle class

Everyman and his apathy toward*
and disbelief of the evil which
threatens to destroy him.

Tim Dols, a senior, appearing for
the first time on the Troub stage, will
play the title role of Gottlieb Bied-
ermann, Playing his wife Babette
Biedermann, is Mrs. Yvonne Dick-
ens, wife of David B. Dickens, Pro-
fessor of German. This couple un-
wittingly falls prey to the evil plans
of two arsonists who openly divulge
their intentions to burn down Bied-
ermann’s house.

Colvin, Volpe Play Bugs

Steve Colvin and Joe Volpe will
play the roles of the two arsonists.
In an allegorical sense, their parts
represent the two faces of evil:
diplomatic and the brutal. Working
as a team, they completely delude
Biedermann and turn his selfish
concern for security into a weapon
for his own destruction. Most re-
markably, they camouflage their in-
tentions to burn the town down by
simply telling the truth.

This play has been seen by many
as a warning against the menace of
Communism which, in plain print in
The Communist Manifesto, declares
not only its intention to engulf the
world, but also outlines its methods
and, theoretically, at least, does
everything “by the book.” Likewise,
Communism employs the threat of
naked force with the wisdom of
diplomacy to accomplish its aims, as
do the two firebugs.

Theatre-Oriented Play

Another aspect of this play is
the return to “open theatricality.”
This merely means that the audience
is kept constantly aware that they
are in a theatre and not sitting as
omniscent observers of real people
doing real things. Dr. Cecil Jones,
director of this production, has
added to the author’s ideas in this
direction with ideas of his own. It
is likely that the audience will be
a bit surprised to find vestiges of a
“Greek Chorus” dressed as fire-
men, and rooms without visible
walls or doors.

Included in this category is the
use of simultaneous settings side by
side of a living room and an attic, the
indication of night by the lowering
of a crescent moon, occasional ele-
ments on stage, which appear out of

Tonight At 8:15
In duPont Aud.

By HOWARD EPSTEIN
Staff Reporter

The origins of the Courtly Ro-
mances will be discussed tonight as
Dr. U. T. Holmes, Kenan professor
cf romance philology at the Uni-
versity of North Carolina speaks in
the duPont Auditorium.

The lecture, “French Romances as
an Early Novelistic Form,” will be-
gin at 8:15. It is the first of the 1963-
64 Seminar in Literature lectures,
and the 46th of the series initiated
in the early 1950's.

Dr. Holmes, an eminent Mediev-
alist, is an authority on the French
literature of the 12th century. In-
cluded in this period are such leg-
ends as King Arthur and Perceval
and the Holy Grail, which have
formed a basis for early literature.
The legends of this period affect not
only the development of French lit-
erature, but also greatly influence
English literature.

A member of the UNC faculty
since 1925 and a full professor there
since 1927, Dr. Holmes was named
Kenan professor at North Carolina
in 1945. He taught at the University
of Missouri from 1923 to 1925. He
received his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees
from Harvard University.

Dr. Holmes, a former Fulbright
lecturer at the University of Mel-
bourne in Australia, has served as a
visiting lecturer in four different
American universities. He was made
a Chevalier de la Legion d’Honneur
by the French government in 1950
and served as president of the South
Atlantic Modern Language Associa-
tion in 1941.

He is co-editor of the Works of
DuBartas, and with A. H. Schintz
he published the History of the
French Language. He also is the
author of History of Old French Lit-
erature and Daily Living in the
Twelfth Century, editor of Volume
I of the Critical Bibliography of
French Literature, managing editor
of Romance Notes, a UNC publica-
tion.

To Remain

In Effect Until February

By TRACY HARRINGTON
Tuesday Managing Editor
The faculty Monday afternoon approved a greatly liberal-
ized cut system, to go into effect next semester.
Modification of the present system, under study by faculty

months, resulted in the new
*absence regulations policy. Accord-
ing to Dean W. W. Pusey, the pres-
ent system will continue to operate
through this semester.

The main feature of the new
cut system is an increase of cuts for
upperclassmen in the 1.0 to 1.5
bracket, and 1.5 to 2.0 category.
Dean’s List students (2.0 for upper-
classmen, 2.5 for freshmen) keep
unlimited cuts under the new sys-
tem.

Freshman Rules Liberalized

First semester freshmen will be
allowed as many absences in each
course as there are class meetings
of the course per week, and second
semester freshmen will be given as
many cuts per course as there are
class meetings in a week if he makes
.60 or above first semester. Second
semester freshmen with 2.5 first se-
mester grade point ratios or above
will be given unlimiteds.

Overcutting Penalty

Since the new absence regulations
permit more cutting, the policy re-
garding overcuts has been restricted.
Whereas under the present system a
student is dropped from a course
upon the second overcut, he will be
dropped with a grade of F for one
overcut.

The body of the new cut system
passed by the faculty is as follows:

I, Absences in the following cate-
gories are free from administrative
penalties; all others are considered
unexcused and are subject to pre-
scribed penalties.

A. 1. Illness requiring a physician’s
care.

2. Participation in authorized Uni-
versity activities.

3. Absences caused by emergen-
cies, which are excused in advance
by the Dean of Students or in his
absence, by the appropriate academic
dean.

B. A student on the Dean’s List
is permitted to determine his own
class attendance.

D, and E—apply only to upperclass-

men. See G and H below for fresh-
men regulations),

Ellison’s ‘Invisible Man’ A Powerful First Novel

 

Ralph Ellison, Invisible Man. (Signet, $.75), 503 pages.

By ROGER PAINE
Note: This summary of Ellison’s Invisible Man is a
compilation of critical material which has been written
about the novel. Although many students may not
have time to read the book for themselves, it is hoped
that the following data will make it possible for a
greater number of the W&L community to appreciate
Ellison’s visit to this campus November 15. (See news
story).

Ralph Ellison is the powerful Negro author from
whom James Baldwin learned his lessons about writ-
ing. Ellison’s first novel, Invisible Man, won a Na-
tional Book Award. He begins it with a Prologue.

“I am an invisible man. No, I am not a spook like
those who haunted Edgar Allan Poe; nor am I one of
your Hollywood-movie ectoplasms. I am a man of
substance, of flesh and bone, fiber and liquids—and I
might even be said to possess a mind. I am invisible,
understand, simply because people refuse to see me.”

The story begins with its Negro protagonist be-
low ground in the basement of a building in a strict
white-rent district. He lives in the glare of 1,369 light
bulbs, whose current is supplied from the tapped line
of Monoplated Light and Power.

Ellison’s protagonist considers himself an invisible
man simply because no one will pay any attention to

him—he can walk down the street, and people pre-
tend that he is not there, that he is not a human being
as they are, An incident which rises out of others’
attitude toward him is described on the second page
of the novel, and is a typical example of the powerful
writing which persists throught its 500 pages:

“One night I accidentally bumped into a man, and
perhaps because of the near darkness he saw me and
called me an insulting name. I sprang at him, seized
his coat lapels and demanded that he apologize. He was
a tall blond man, and as my face came close to his he
looked insolently out of his blue eyes and cursed me,
his breath hot in my face as he struggled. I pulled his
chin down sharp upon the crown of my head, butting
him is I had seen the West Indians do, and I felt his
flesh tear and the blood gush out, and I yelled, ‘Apol-
ogize! Apologize!’ But he continued to curse and strug-
gle, and I butted him again and again until he went
down heavily, on his knees, profusely bleeding. I
kicked him repeatedly, in a frenzy because he still
uttered insults though his lips were frothy with blood.
Oh yes, I kicked him! And in my outrage I get out my
knife and prepared to slit his throat, right there be-
neath the lamplight in the deserted street, holding him
by the collar with one hand, and opening the knife
with my teeth—when it occurred to me that the man
had not seen me, actually; that he, as far as he knew,
was in the midst of a walking nightmare! And I stop-

ped the blade, slicing the air as I pushed him away,
letting him fall back to the street,”

This incident occurs after the protagonist has lived
through the events that are told in the rest of the
novel. The story really is concerned with showing
the reader how the Negro comes to such a state, and
how he realizes that the whites would like to consider
him an invisible being.

In the first section of the novel, the protagonist
goes to a colored college in the South. Through two
highly dramatic and violent scenes, Ellison explains the
attitude of the white South toward the Negro. In one
instance a Negro sharecropper named Trueblood is
visited. He has had an incestuous relationship with
his daughter. Because of this, he is treated as a celebri-
ty by the white people in the community. His infamy
gains him material benefits from the whites which
his hard work had never won,

Trueblood is a freak and a “typical nigger” in the
eyes of the whites, and so they build him up. True-
bloods reaction is full of irony:

“The nigguhs up at the school come down to chase
me off and that made me mad. I went to see the white
folks then and they gave me help. That’s what I don’t
understand, I done the worse thing a man could ever
do in his family and instead of chasin’ me out of the
country, they gimme more help than they ever give
any other colored man, no matter how good a nigguh

he was. Except that my wife an’ daughter won’t speak
to me, I'm better off than I ever been before. And
even if Kate won’t speak to me she took the new
clothes I bought her from up in town and now she’s
gettin’ some eyeglasses made what she been needin’
for so long, But what I don’t understand is how I done
the worse thing a man can do in his own family and
stead of things gittin’ bad, they got better. The nigguhs

up at school don’t like me, but the white folks treats
me fine.”

Later in the novel, a Negro who is a former surgeon
comes into the plot—he had been a brain surgeon, and
while in France, had performed several operations of
note. Nostalgia brought him back to the states, but he
had forgotten about the southern white bigots. The
doctor explains what happened to him:

“I returned to save a life and I was refused,” he
said. “Ten men in masks drove me out from the city
at midnight and beat me with whips for saving a hu-
man life. I was forced to the utmost degradation be-
cause I possessed skilled hands and the belief that
my knowledge could bring me dignity—not wealth,
only dignity—and other men health!” This incident,
which is Trueblood in reverse, shows how the white
South rewards genuine accomplishment.

Later, through a sermon delivered by a

Literature And Politics

We call special attention to the literature and politics
columns of this edition, published weekly on this page.
Today we are featuring in the “‘Current Literature in Re-
view” section some poetry written by students and col-
lected by Special Features Editor Bert Phillips.

Because we believe that student creative talent should
have a medium through which it can be heard, and because
we feel that The Ring-tum Phi can offer a place (if not
an entirely adequate one) for such talent, we encourage
any students who have written in the past or who have now
started to write, to submit their work to editor Phillips.

In the future, the “Current Literature in Review” sec-
tion will present critical reviews of such writers as Ayn
Rand, Lawrence Durrell, Truman Capote, and John Up-
dike, as well as broader studies of selected literary figures
of the first half of the twentieth century such as Faulkner,
Fitzgerald, Hemingway, and Cozzens.

Last week, the ‘Political Horizons” column was key-
noted by an explication of the liberal philosophy. Today
the same thing is done for the conservative philosophy.
This column will be published weekly throughout the
school year, presenting one week the liberal view and
the next week the conservative view, and centring on
specific issues.

We found it interesting to note that the two philoso-
phies, when set down on paper, seem to strike very sim-
ilar notes. Last week Tracy Harrington wrote that liberal-
ism “wishes to make possible for all individuals and groups
to have the opportunity to exercise their powers, so far
as this can be done without injury to others,” and that
liberalism believes that ‘the source of all progress lies in
the free exercise of individual energy.”

Today, Bill Braithwaite and Wyatt Durrette write,
concerning conservatism that it believes “that social struc-
ture is best which places upon the individual the oppor-
tunity and responsibility of shaping his own destinity; that
political structure is best which does for the individual
only what he cannot do for himself; that economic struc-
ture is best which allows maximum freedom in the utiliza-
tion of private property to satisfy material desires.”

In coming weeks, ‘Political Horizons” will be brought
down to more concrete issues, more definite explanation
of terms, and we hope, will help members of the student
body to understand more fully the ramifications of specific
national political issues leading up to the mock conven-
tion next spring.

Ellison’s Planned Visit

The lecture in Lee Chapel scheduled for November
15 will be a first for Washington and Lee. It will be a first
because Ralph Ellison is the first Negro speaker to be suc-
cessfully invited to come to this campus. From the stand-
point of his reputation, a better man to be the first of his
race as a speaker here could not have been chosen.

 

Ellison is a very distinguished writer, having won
with his first novel, Invisible Man, a National Book
Award. He helped James Baldwin get his start in writ-
ing. Ellison’s personal experiences, judging by his writing,
seems to be very great.

In this issue we have published a lengthy review of
Invisible Man. We wish to make it clear that this review is
inadequate in that it covers only a small part of the actual
plot of the novel. There are several lengthy quotes from
the book which, we have inserted into the review because
it is impossible to understand the force of Ellison’s prose
without going directly to it.

Extensive critical material on Invisible Man, is avail-
able in the library for interested students, and we encour-
age those who wish to hear Ellison’s lecture to familiarize
themselves with the overall content of his work. It is an
excellent novel, powerfully composed, and sensitively

felt.

Current Cinema

Past and Present Cinema
A Fallacy in Film Review

By TOM PACE

The age-old problem of youth is that we (you and I being youth-
ful) have not experienced the good old days. You know—when
Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, Bobby Jones, Jack Dempsey, and Gene Tunney
were the idols of our parents’ generation. I have thought for some
time that most likely, Mantle, Mays, Palmer, Nicklaus, Marciano,
Liston, and dozens of other athletes of our time are doubtless super-
ior to the athletes of forty years ago.

Until recently however, I had simply accepted that this premise
did not apply to films. I listened somewhat reverently to our elders
when they said that movies just aren’t what they used to be for
indeed these people had had the good fortune to see films both
then and now. But now I am convinced that they are wrong, and
that it takes little perception to illustrate that fact.

Whenever lists of the greatest films of all time are made up, the
lists always include many more films of thirty and forty years ago
than they do of more recent films. And surprisingly nearly all the
respected critics abide by this principle, i.e., “this film is the best
of its kind since . ...”

The Lonely Death

And though his heart did pound,

He primed his gun and fixed his gaze;

He fired six more and still it came;
That line of grey: but why?

Why was it that he had been sent,
To this bare place to kill,

To kill those whom two months before,
He would have helped when ill?

Was it because their Abe had said,
“Both Black and White must be
Free to find those things which God
Had planned for man to see?”

And while he thought of this and more,
The grey line still came on.

Again he fired, and beside him fell,
The best friend he had known.

Once more the question came to him?
“Why had his friend to die?”
One Black only he had known.

This one’s name was Sy.

Sy was drunk near half the time,
And he was the biggest lout.
Surely his kind was not enough

To fight a war about.

And still he searched his soul.

times as many absences in each
course as there are class meetings
of the course per week and if he
has a cumulative 1.0 on all work
attempted and if he has earned a
grade-point ratio of 1.5 with no
grade below a C on his preceding
semester report.

D. A student is permitted twice
as many absences in each course as
there are class meetings of the
course per week if he has a cumula-
tive .6 at the end of his freshman
year, .7 at the end of his sophomore
year, and 9 at the end of his junior
year, and if he has earned a grade-
point ratio of 1.0 on his preceding
semester report.

E. A student not on academic pro-
bation but failing to meet the stand-
ards above is permitted as many ab-
sences in each course as there are
class meetings of the course per
week.

F. A student on academic proba-
tion is permitted two absences in
each course if he did not exceed
the limit permitted him in any
course the preceding semester. One
absence per course is permitted in
any event.

G. A first-semester freshman is
permitted as many absences in each
course as there are class meetings
of the course per week.

H. A second semester freshman is

permitted as many absences in each
course as there are class meetings
of the course per week if he has
achieved a grade-point ratio of 6
on the work of the preceding semes-
ter. Only one cut in each course is
permitted if his grade-point ratio
is below 6.

Il. If the instructor concerned
considers that absences have con-
tributed materially to unsatisfactory
work on the part of any student in
‘tthe above categories, he may request
the appropriate dean to revoke the
student’s absence privileges in that
class. Any absences thereafter will
be considered unexcused.

Ill. Unexcused absences are sub-
ject to the following penalties. If a
student has one unexcused absence
beyond the number permitted his
eategory in I or II above, he shall
be dropped from that course with
an F. (Subject to appeal to the
Albsence Committee.)

IV. The classification of transfer

students for absence regulation pur-
poses shall be determined by the ap-
propriate committee at the time of
admission.
V. Absences before and after any
holiday are limited to Dean’s List
students or those on mid-semester
or semester Honor Roll.

The section in the University Cat-
alogue beginning “Any student...”

(P. 108), remains the same, with

the exception that reinstatement may
be made only on conditions to be
determined by the Absence Commit-
tee of the Faculty.

The portion of the new proposal
dealing with probation (catalogue,
page 105) is as follows:

1. Academic Probation—A student
is placed on academic probation if
he is re-instated after falling under
the Automatic Rule. A student on
academic probation is permitted two
absences in each course if he did not
exceed the limit permitted him in
any course during the preceding
semester. One absence per course is
permitted in any event. A student
on academic probation is not per-
mitted to own, control, or operate a
motor vehicle in or around Lexing-
ton. He may be required to withdraw
from the University at any time that
his academic work is unsatisfactory.

The sections in the catalogue deal-
ing with absence probation and final
absence probation are to be elimi-
nated.

While the new cut system was
given across the board aproval at
yesterday’s faculty meeting, Dean
Pusey indicated that “experience
may lead to modification” of any or
part of the proposed system.

While the body of the new regu-
lations have been finalized, the pre-
cise wording as it will appear in the
catalogue may be changed.

 

Political Horizons

 

Property, Tradition and Opportunity
Foundations of Conservative Doctrine

By WILLIAM BRAITHWAITE and
WYATT B. DURETTE, JR.
We emphasize at the beginning
that this is not an attempt to deli-
neate “the conservative movement”—
but only a setting forth of our view
of responsible philosophical conser-
vatism. As this philosophy—and it
is so, not just a political credo—places
primary and final importance on the
individual qua individual, neces-
sarily there will be divergent views.
We feel, however, there is a defi-
nite, albeit general, philosophical
framework within which these views
may be consistently incorporated.
To begin: we believe that God, in
creating Man, gave him the right to
life, and necessarily therefore, also
the right to those things required
for life—namely, food and shelter,
which Man acquires through the use
of property.
Initial Importance on Individual
We believe that initial importance
in any social, political or economic
structure should be placed upon
the individual; therefore, we con-
clude that society exists for the

individual, not the individual for
society. (That this latter notion
leads to many mischevious conclu-
sions we will show in later columns.)

Upon this reasoning that social
structure is best which places upon
the individual the opportunity and
responsibility of shaping his own
destiny; that political structure is
best which does for the individual
only what he cannot do for him-
self; that economic structure is best
which allows maximum freedom in
the utilization of private property
to satisfy material desires. (We de-
fine the “maximum” as that point
where one man’s freedom infringes
upon another’s.)

Tradition a Guide

We believe that history, or more
particularly, tradition, furnishes de-
pendable if not final indication which
political and economic systems best
attain these ends: specifically, a con-
stitutional republican form of gov-
ernment, and a private property,
capitalistic economy.

Tradition we view as the culmi-
nation of generations of reason and

experience, and therefore we believe
it is a valuable source of prescrip-
tive knowledge. Neither to be fol-
lowed blindly nor discarded in emo-
tional haste for change, it is rather
to be studied, prudently, in an effort
to preserve that which is wise and
relinquish that which has proved
unwise.

Freedom vs. Not-Freedom

Extending our views beyond na-
tional borders, we contend that the
world conflict today is most accur-
ately assessed as a conflict between
freedom and not-freedom—a conflict
between those seeking freedom not
only for themselves but also for
others, and those who deny freedom
to each and all.

We contend that since the United
States is the de facto leader of
those nations which represent free-
dom in varying, humanly imperfect
ways, the preservation and extension
of freedom depends upon the deter-
mination of the American people,
with whom lies the largest propor-
tion of the moral, physical and finan-
cial burdens of the struggle.

I was playing a fast game of hand-
ball in the gym today when I ran
into or rather, was run into, by
Coach Dunderbrawn. He was try-
ing to get out to the gym floor to
put his boys through their paces.
When he got through with them,
he started talking to me about the
poor physical condition of most W&L
men.

“They come here from years of
football and other such _ beneficial
activities, and then let themselves
go to pot,” he said. “If it weren't
for this compulsory P.E. class, they
would turn into vegetables.”

I asked him if he thought the
P.E. program really kept anyone
in shape. He said it probably didn’t.
“But that’s their fault—not ours.
I’ve seen boys do what they called
ten push-ups without ever pushing
their body off the floor.”

Coach Dunderbrawn continued:
“Last week I got a good example of
the attitude the boys take toward
this class—they hate it, you know.
Most of them will do anything they
can to get out of P.E. As I was say-
ing, last week a boy broke his wrist
in a class and now he is trying to
tell us that he should be excused
from classes. Lots of football players
have gone through a whole game
with worse injuries.”

I have heard that the P.E. de-
partment is rather insistent about
people with injuries taking their
courses, but at times there seems to
be a mistake in their logic.

Friday, November 1

I have a date this weekend who
says that she likes people who are
different—who aren’t afraid “to be
themselves.” While walking down
the colonnade this morning, I real-
ized that there are quite a few indi-
vidualists around here—and it’s quite
easy to spot them, because they all
have the same features: messed up
hair, sport shirts with a tie draped
around their neck, and an ill-fitting
coat. I get the impression that they
stand in front of a mirror for a half-
hour each morning, messing their
hair up to just the right degree so
that everyone will know that they
don’t give a damn.

A person defeats his own purpose
when he tries to rest his individual-
ity in his seemingly careless dress—

‘Invisible Man’

Reminiscent Of
Faulkner Style

(Continued from page 1)

 

minister at his college, the protagon-
is learns of the irony of the southern
Negro college. Its purpose is not to
enlighten, but to indoctrinate with a
myth. The minister says that the
colored race is a humble but fast-
rising people, and that they need
only adopt the white’s success for-
mula, At the close of the sermon,
the protagonist realizes that the min-
ister is blind.

Invisible Man is full of symbo-
lism, and one striking scene occurs
with the protagonist, now in New
York City, working for the Liberty
Paint Company. The company puts
him to work on a batch of paint
which is to be used on a national
monument—he must measure ten
drops of black liquid into each
bucket of “Optic White” paint, and
then stir the mixture until the
black becomes invisible. Inadvert-
ently the youth gets a refill of what
he thinks is the prescribed black
liquid from the wrong tank, and
thus dopes the white paint with
concentrated remover, making vis-
ible the black liquid within the
white.

In later experiences, the protag-
onist becomes mixed up in mass
movements, and discovers that in
working for the “Brotherhood” tc
further the cause of his race, he
is just as invisible as before, be-
cause the Brotherhood is willing tc
sacrifice the individual for the over-
all drive toward acceptance of the
race.

The novel ends with a race riot
in which most of the major conflict:
are resolved. In running from the
scene of the riot, the protagonis
meets a gang of white hoodlum:
armed with baseball bats. He jump:
into an open manhole, landings
finally in a coal cellar, where hi
can enjoy the safety of his invisi-
bility.

Falling asleep, the protagonis
dreams of being surrounded by hi:

have run his life. In one of the mos

Washington and Lee scored once

downed Franklin and Marshall Col-

a team high of 34, were outstanding
W&L players as the Generals tallied
21 first downs to F&M’s 10.

the pigskin to the Diplomats’ 28.

Soccer Team Edges American TE 2-1; 3

Kilpatrick Tops Bradford In Tennis

BY TOM CARPENTER
Tuesday Sports Writer

American University is well known for the large number
of foreigners in its student body. Only eight of 1257 students
at Washington and Lee are from foreign countries. Yet the
General’s soccer team beat American at its own game, the use

of foreigners on the team. *

The Great Dane, Preben Berthel- |
sen, led the Generals to a 2 to 1
conquest of the Eagles at American
Saturday. Berthelsen set up the
first W&L score to tie the game and
then scored the decisive goal.

The first half of the match was
scoreless, mainly because of the
fine play of the W&L halfbacks
and GideonGadebeku , the center
halfback for American, who hails
from Nigeria. Tom Green and the
Bagle goalie had an easy time for
first 44 minutes.

American scored first with 15 min-
utes remaining in the third quarter
when Schwartz took a pass from
Celtnieks and booted it into the
nets. But the hosts were destined
to score no more.

The winners tied it with 1:30 left
in the period on Chris Clarke’s goal.
Berthelsen got the winning goal
with 6 minutes left in the game on
what may be described as an ideal
play that was executed with perfec-
tion. Passes from Tim Henry to

Steve Hibbard to Berthelsen gave

him the easy shot to wrap up the
victory.
W&L controlled the ball through-

With another fine team effort, the
W&L harriers edged past American
University, 26-34, Saturday on the

«| Washington course.

The home team captured the first
two places, but W&L easily took the
next four sports. Sophomore Rif
O’Connor led the Generals, followed
closely by senior Charlie Head, with
his best time of the year, junior
Andy Kilpatrick, and freshman Bill
Wildrick. American captured the
next place, but W&L sophomores
Ed Wood and Lee Johnson took the
next two.

Times for the Generals were pret-
ty good considering the cold, dry

’ windy day and that the A.U. course

is about a mile shorter than the
W&L course.

Coach Miller was especially hap-

 

py with the team performance,
pointing out that oly 26 seconds
separated our first five men. He felt
that the A.U. course was a good one
with many similarities to our own.

Short Course

Captain Kilpatrick felt that the
team was hurt by the shortness of
the course and would have done bet-
ter on our own course. He was very
pleased with the team showing so
far this year (they are 5-1) and em-
phasized that the Generals are a
young team.

The harriers will be working very
hard this week in preparation for
the State meet in Richmond on Sat-
urday. Tough competition will be
seen from VMI, W&M, and Old Do-
minion (the only team to beat the
Generals). On the next Saturday,
W&L faces Fairmont in the final
meet of the year.

For example, last year when|
“Days of Wine and Roses” was re-|
leased, Time referred to it as the|
finest film on alcoholism since “Lost |
Weekend.” Well, Sunday night 1|
saw “Lost Weekend” and despite the |
fact that it mentioned Time maga- |
zine twice, and even dropped Henry
Luce’s name, it was a terrible movie.
Whereas the one, “Days,” was a
cemi-successful film, the other
“Weekend,’ was a sermonish and

absoluately no room for comparison.

Another example might be the
two versions of “A Star Is Born.”
The more recent 1954 version has
James Mason’s excellent perfor-
mance, Judy Garland’s singing, and
an almost honestly moving finale.
The original of the thirties is noth-
ing more than brutal testimony of
the sentimental crap that movie-
goers of that decade apparently ate
up.

made (and still is) by critics every-
where. Ridiculous. Though certain
elements in its make-up allow that
it is a fine movie, it is nonetheless
chock full of faults—melodrama,
poor acting, poor lines and a mean-
ing-destroying ending. It cannot
compare to the truly brilliant films
of the last several years.

Kurosawa’s treatment of ‘“Rash-
omon” was not nearly as cinematic
as are the treatments of “Jules and
Jim,” “Hiroshima Mon Amour,” or
“81,,” to mention only the finest
films of Truffant, Resnais, and Fel-
lini. After the first forty minutes,
“Rashomon” became a stolid, limited,
often boring film, which was much |
more literary than it was cinematic. |

The cinema is still a new art
form. Past examples are being re-
fined and improved upon. Directors
today have the advantage of the
teaching of the early models, and
the real artists of the cinema have
learned. (Much the same as James
and Tolstoy were able to learn
from the two centuries of novelists
who preceded them.)

Though there is certainly a lot of
trash released at present, this can-
not alter the fact that the great
films of the last few years are really
the best films ever made.

Ellison’s Novel Has ‘Power’

BE FREE OF ILLUSION...” And
| in this state, the protagonist feels he
is invisible no longer. Awakening
from his dream, however, he knows
that he will stay underground, in
glare of his 1,369 light bulbs, trying
to “think things out in peace.”

Invisibility in the novel is a sym-
bol for the loss of self, and the
overriding theme is that color de-
prives the Negro of his individuali-
ty. Yet, as is also implicit in the
story, all men have been deprived
of their individuality by the ma-
chine age. Ellison’s story is an af-
firmation of the worth and dignity
of the individual in the face of forces
which conspire to render him in-
visible.

Ellison balances his novel on a
line between comedy and tragedy.
The comedy is, however, a laughter-
to-keep-from-crying. The novel has
a broad sweep. going from revival
meeting to funeral sermon to gradu-
ation address to the numbers racket,
the boxing ring, the ball park, the
bar room, Harlem. The dialogue is
full of spicy jive talk and occasional
Biblical phrases. Symbolism is im-
portant—some of it overt—with a
scene, for instance, of a bartender
slicing off the white heads on the
beers he has just poured.

The style is both tight and loose—
there is not a detail wasted, and yet
many of the sentences run on in
Faulknerian style. Jazz and the blues
play an important part in the sym-
bolic elements of the story. It is
impossible to outline the entire book | *
in any depth—but it is a novel well
worth reading and it is a story which
moves quickly. It should be on
everyone's reading list, above and
beyond the fact that its author will
be here on campus November 15.

‘Firebugs’ Biting Allegory
Of Businessman’s Stereotype

Our generation was born in the time of war. We have a dark memory
of some evil shadow, but we were not immediately conscious of it. We
read about it now in textbooks and see those Chaplinesque movies about
the little man with the bug on his upper lip. But is it merely textbook
material or farce? Can we pass it off as a mistake? As something curiously
foreign in the “American Way”?

 

 

The Firebugs is a warning against such a stupid and complacent
belief. The play is a point to point allegory of an ordinary business-
man ensnared in his guilt, unable to make a moral decision, From
the beginning the allegory is clear, the conclusion inevitable. The
dramatic power of the play lies in the focus on Biedermann, his
feeble attempts to assert some belief, some decision in the opposition
to the joyful do-evilers who come to live in his house. By means
of the comic and certain dramatic devices, Frisch alienates the au-
dience from any kind of affectionate release, forcing them to make
a considered decision as opposed to the indecision of Biedermann.
In the third act, Biedermann addresses the audience asking them
what they would have done. “And when? At what time?” There is
no answer.

It is one of the high moments of the school year when the Trouba-
dours present a play. Whether provocatively modern or the classic, their
work is always technically finished and a realization of the theatrical. May
we commend Dr, Jones and all the people connected with the production
for maintaining this standard in The Firebugs.

Biedermann Played too Loosely

On the surface this appears like an easy play in terms of character
portrayal and movement; it is, in actuality, very delicate and easily mis-
handled. The characters are sharply defined and the surface action is
simple, any deviation or poor pantomime can cause considerable loss of
audience belief. We felt, for example, that Biedermann is played too
loosely. We never see the solidity, however phony, a businessman in an
economically secure position. Tim Dols does a splendid job in the scene
with the fireman and the soliloquy, but the early scenes do not establish
any background or motive force which builds to the conclusion. He
too frenetic. Certainly the most truly solid character is Sepp Schmity,
played by Joe Volpe in his first Troubadour production, and I hope we
see more of him. With an overbearing physique and exceedingly cordial
manners, Schmity delicately storms his way into Bidermann’s house, thus
setting up the inevitable. Schmity’s fellow arsonist, Willie Eisenring,
played by Steve Colvin. Dropping all pretense, Eisenring tells Biedermann
that they will burn his house—a joke to Biedermann. Colvin does a fine
job as the oily, blunt ex-headwaiter

The supporting roles, particularly the female side, are ver) ably
handled, Babette, Biedermann’s wife as played by Yvonne Dickens,
is the naive helpmate who is always asking the wrong questions,
That Frisch’s concern is universal is displayed when Babette address-
es the female membership of the audience. Betsy Letcher shows in
her role as Anna, the maidservant, that she has gained the maturity

‘Romance’ Form

Similar To Novel

Medieval French Romances as
forerunners of modern novelistic
form were discussed by Urban Tig-
|ner Holmes at the fortieth Wé&L
seminar in Literature Tuesday night.
| Holmes’ lecture, which was given
}in duPont Auditorium, was spon-
| sored by the Department of Ro-
mance Languages and by the Sem-
inars in Literature Committee.

The “ingredients of the novel as
we understand it” are present in a
great deal of 12th and 13th century
French literautre,” said Holmes, but
| he warned that the modern definition
!of a novel cannot be applied too
closely to the medieval forms.

The chief difference between mod-
ern novels and the French Romances
is thet the earlier work was done
entirely in verse, Holmes explained.
In medieval literature, however,
verse was the only natural form,
since stories were meant to be re-
cited and verse lends itself to mem-
ory. Verse was used for the same
purposes for which prose is employ-
ed today. A second contrast between
the two forms is found in the ele-
ment of the supernatural present
in the Romances.

The speaker mentioned and dis-
| cussed several points of comparison
between the medieval and modern
forms. The Romances, said Holmes,
contain characterization and charac-
ter development. They show conti-
nuity of plot, with the plot most
often unfolding a love story. In de-
tails of local color, and finally in
length, the Romances are again sim-
ilar to modern novels.

The earliest Romances, said
Holmes, were either biographical, re-
lating the entire life of a hero; or

Opinion Poll
On Cut System

By SYD LEWIS

After eight months of study, the
faculty decided to approve a new cut
system to be instituted next semes-
ter. Although in a Ring-tum Phi poll
students (95 per cent) praised the
new system as better than the ex-
isting one, there were still some
doubts that the new rules concern-
ing class attendance were everything
to be desired.

 

Grades

Probably of most concern to the
faculty is whether academic work
will suffer because of excess cutting.
Twenty-nine per cent of the stu-
dents questioned felt in the short run
the grades would fall while 70.5
per cent thought the cut system
would not be harmful to grades and
5 per cent had no opinion. On the
other hand, only 5 per cent of the
students were willing to speculate
that there would be any long range
damages to grades.

Divisions

Certainly, the four possible divi-
sions which the new cut system im-
poses on students will increase the
bookkeeping headache for the regis-
trar’s office; however, 71 per cent of
the students felt the divisions were
fair and tht the extra beekkeeping
would be justified. One per cent said
they were not familiar enough with
the new cut system to judge the
arditrary divisions while 28 per cent
said they were definitely against the
divisions .

The fact that a student who makes
|4 “A’s” and a “D” is not considered
| Dean's list because he has made
|a grade below “C” was not changeci
jin the new cut system. As a matter

of faet, such a student who has over
}a two point will not even he

| thought this was unfair.

State Chairmen Meet

At a meeting of the state chairmen
Wednesday night, members of the
Convention Steering Committee re-
ported on the progress of the Con-
vention. Sharp said that he “hopes
to announce” the identity of the key-
note speaker very soon. Negotiations
have been proceeding very satisfac-
torially, he said.

Sharp also said that the Mock
Convention has received letters from
“about fifty Representatives and
Senators since it sent copies of the
Convention brochure to all members
of Congress.”

 

Novice Debaters

At Wake Forest

By KEN McGRAW

Four W&L freshmen debating
over ‘the weekend in the Wake For-
est Novice Debate Tournament at
Winston-Salem won six debates and
lost six. The affirmative team com-
posed of Charles Levy, Alan Fow-
ler and Tyree Harris had a 4-2
record. Harris was chosen one of
the top ten speakers in the tourna-
ment out of a field of 128 debaters
representing 29 colleges and uni-
versities.

This weekend, W&L will send four
debaters to Morris Harvey in
Charleston, W. Va. Charles Reese
and John McMurray will debate for
affirmative, and William Grant and
James Stalnaker for the negative.

Students who wish to see practice
debates may do so on Tuesday after-
noons at 4:45, Wednesday nights at
9: 30, | or Thursday afternoons at 4: 30.

Not Proving Themselves

If there is one thing fraternities at W&L have learned
well, it’s the art of timing their trouble-making for when, pres-
tige-wise, they stand to lose the most. Last week proved no ex-
ception. Within forty-eight hours of the much publicized
IFC-faculty “good relations” banquet, all pandemonium broke
loose. Pleased with the apparent sincerity of fraternity leaders
at the Tuesday night assembly the faculty was almost immedi-
ately thereafter shocked by the reports that several pledge
classes were “‘encouraged” by their actives to “guard” their re-
spective houses over Halloween night. One or more fraterni-
ties sponsored for the freshmen rather lengthy scavenger hunts.
Pledges were having to engage in these activities during one of
the most critical hour-exam weeks. And as if to ascertain that
that the faculty would be aware of this nonsense, a pledge was
bound hand and foot and deposited near, of all places, the
residence of a W&L professor.

Such a fortuity of events simply brings to a head once again
a well-worn issue. Are the pledge programs of our fraternities
beyond re-examining and re-evaluating? Could it be that the
necessity of rallies, and paddle-waving reflect some shortcoming
in the instilling of the fraternity’s ideals? Is coercion merely a
resort the actives use because they don’t know any better means
of influencing a pledge’s outlook?

As long as fraternities continue to arouse these questions,
they are hurting themselves irrevocably. Is there any way the
fraternity system and what it stands for can reflect their con-
structive side to the University? In a case where their survival
itself is at stake, the fraternities can not afford to let this chal-
lenge go unheeded.

A Little Carelessness

It is our predilection, based on past record, that sometime
before the end of the year, a student of this University will
“total” his automobile. If the record holds true, at least one
person involved will die or suffer irreparable injury. The tragic
thing about this accident will be that it could have been avoided.
If there just hadn’t been that one little chance: that ‘‘one for
the road,” that attempt to pass on a solid line, the hasty trip
back home on an icy road.

If you are that student, you will never forget the details
of what happened. In a flash, you had found yourself in the
path of an oncoming car; it was too late for the brakes. What
followed was too sudden for comprehension—you only re-

call the nauseating sensation of a mouthful of blood, the|'
racking pain of a split skull. What you'll never forget is what’s |;

on the seat beside you—a limp body pinned to the dashboard,
a head obscured in the crushed windshield.

Inhuman, yes. It’s a gruesome price for just a little care-
lessness. But that’s one of the freaks of modern living—the
combination of an over-confident driver and statistical averages.
One of us in the coming months will experience such a freak.
Will this year find that it’s your turn?

Reader Questions Motives
For Inviting Ellison Here

\3

 

The Ring-tum Phi:

Quite recently the Trustees and
Administration of Sweet Briar Col-
lege have requested a court inter-
pretation of the will of its founder
to determine whether or not it may
accept for consideration the appli-
cation of a Negro applicant.

Randolph-Macon Woman's College
is trying, despite the efforts of its
many loyal alumnae, to get its Board
of Trustees to permit it to accept
a Negro applicant.

Is Washington and Lee trying to

get at least on the tail end of this
movement? Although both of the
above institutions are a bit extreme
when compared to that of Washing-
ton and Lee, one cannot help wond-
ering just what the reasoning is be-
hind the decision to invite Ralph
Ellison to speak in Lee Chapel, and
just who made the decision.
If we are simply in search of
interesting and educational persons
to speak here, why not invite a
qualified Chinese, Japanese, or Arab
to appear here? Surely there are
many others who could speak here
who would be timely and interest-
ing, and who would be available
and anxious to speak at Washington
and Lee.

Ralph Ellison can be no more
timely than Martin Luther King

the decision to have Ellison speak
principles, then it might be difficult

wondering whether or not HE is
coming for purely academic pur-
poses, no matter what the inten-
tions are of those who invited him
to appear here.

Make no mistake about the matter:
Ellison may not be one of the rabble-
rousers like Martin Luther King or
one of the legal-eagles like Thur-
good Marshall who are actively try-
ing to lead the Negro “crusade,” but
his purpose in life, or at least his
written subjects, is no more than a
subtle appeal for sympathy, money,
or anything else which will advance
the cause of the Negro, not help the

Chapters Resist Fraternities
On Racial Discrimination

(This article is the second in a
series of four articles on the gen-
eral condition of American fra-
ternities today.)

By WARREN MONTGOMERY

Washington and Lee, in its se-
cluded geographical and social posi-
tion, is usually very much out of
contact with the general trends in
other American colleges. In particu-
lar, most students here are unaware
of the widespread problem of frater-
nities and discrimination, both racial
and religious.

At least half of today’s fraternity
crises is accountable to uncertainty
about discrimination on the local
and national levels. Traditionally,
fraternity membership has _ been
based on the foundation of White
Anglo-Saxon Protestiantism. Since
the middle 50’s, however, the princi-

 

ple movement in domestic American
life has been one of liberalization of
old our social and moral beliefs con-
cerning race and religion.

Stronghold of Tradition

Fraternities, founded in a differ-
ent age, have been the college
strongholds of the old order. Through
individual chapters’ feelings and tra-
ditional selective membership clauses
in national constitutions, the old
order has been preserved in frater-
nities. But within the last four or
five years, steps have been taken to
alter the discriminatory nature of the
fraternities.

These steps can generally be
placed into two types—the situation
where the schools involved act
against their chapters and the situa-
tion where the individual chapters

 

Tragedy Of Love Is Theme

Friday Columnist

Any considerations of social order
rest finally on the accepted concept
of man as an individual. Whether
the agreement is by legal provisions
or unwritten consent, the nature of
that philosophy is what will deter-
mine a foundation of action for the
regulating forces in 'the society. Once
this formative principle has been
established it must serve as the one
irrevocable belief of the society; it
will serve as the common reference
on which all judgments are to be
ultimately based. Any change of the
belief would concomitantly be a
change of the society.

The individual as a man has no
existence apart from a society. He
creates or realizes his being by as-
sociation with other individuals and
with his environment. Society may
thus be defined as the collective as-
sociation of all individuals, but both
society and the individual must be
defined in terms of each other. Ob-
viously, the individual is recognized
as a part of the whole, however, the
individual only achieves fullest de-
velopment in relation to his social
contact. Baron Wilhelm von Humbolt
in “The Sphere and Duties of Gov-
ernment” wrote that “the end of man
is the highest and most harmonious
development of his powers to a
complete and consistent whole.” This
whole can only be realized within
the framework of society. It is im-
possible to describe the individual
only in terms of himself.

It appears that modern conserva-
tive thought maintains that property
is the key to the individual’s de-
velopment. And since they see prop-
erty as the basis of achieving the
“consistent whole,” they naturally
regard the right of hclding proper-

 

which to construct a social order. It
follows that a government, under
such a conservative principle, would

operate solely for the preservation | ”

of this right and other allied rights
as the society became more complex.
From this arises such ideas as “that
government is best which governs
least” and government should only
“do for the individual what he can-
not do for himself,” for example,
breaking monopolies on property.

There is however, or perhaps for-
tunately, another view on the rela-
tion of the individual to society.
Liberalism incorporates the belief
that man as an individual realizes
his fullest potential and being
through his granted opportunity to
synthesize that which the society has
to offer and through hie contribu-
‘tion to society.

from environmental or social con- |

This function of government is
to provide unlimited opportunity for
expression and development. Of
course, in a modern society, the im-
plications or ramifications of Liber-
alism enters into many areas of
human endeavor. For example, the
provision of a basic standard of
living by the society through the
government may be seen as a neces-
sity to fuller development based on
the idea that individuals
hampered by economic considera-
tions are also restricted in oppor-
tunity of expression and contribu-
tion. Whether the individual chooses
to utilize these opportunities is left

Behind the play is a writer personally involved as a human like

everybody else. The play is not a dissection or a satirical attack,

but a personal plea. Biedermann’s “tragic” flaw is that he will not
become involved.

The most interesting thing technically about the play is the chorus
of firemen. They are the guardians of the community who, unfortunately,
cannot be of service until they are called. They cannot combat evil until
after the conflagation has started, if then. We would like to commend all
the members of the chorus for the patience and perseverance that must
have gone into their difficult and individually underwarding effort. The
scene with Biedermann in the second act is one of the best to pass across
the Troubadour boards.

Technical Obstacles Well-Handled

Having a split-level set and a nine man chorus, The Firebug demands a
flexible stage. Because of the lack of this at the Troubadour theater, the
chorus could not be used with maximum effectiveness. Another technical
item that is annoying to the audience is the shadows that hide the actor’s
eyes. That Mac McKinnon still presents beautifully lighted shows is so

better facilities.

We have hinted that Frisch’s concern is not so much with Hitlerism or
conformism or some other abstract-ism but with human decision. Because
of this we wish the Troubadour production had not used German names.

Side, Leonard Bernstein wrote a mu-
sical score far above the usual stand-
ards for Broadway, and Stephen
Sondheim contributed enduring ly-
ics. Jerome Robbins devised bril-
liant and novel choreography to ex-
press in terms of modern dance the
emotional restlessness of the “Jets”
and their competitors, the Puerto
Rican “Sharks.” The original musi-
cal stunned audiences with its stark
power and agonizing tragedy; the
film is an improvement of the orig-
inal and, indeed, a trumatic ex-
tension of its virtues and the pos-
sibilities of modern cinema.

A word, first, about technique.
Cameraman for the production was
Daniel C. Fapp, (who is responsible
for the excelint photography of The
Great Escape and A New Kind of
Love); working closely with him was
Jerome Robbins, who restyled his
choreography for the heightened vis-
ual demands of the Panavision lens.
The result is a fusion of sequences
that is virtually perfect, so seam-
lessly do the scenes blend from ac-
tual West Side Street to studio
sets. All of the singing is dubbed
impeccably—Marni Nixon is a really
radiant Maria and Jim Bryant a
light but intense Tony. (Neither of
these fine singing artists receive the
credit on the advertisements.)

Their visual counterparts, Natalie
Wood and Richard Beymer, are hon-
est and sincere in their roles and
mouth their “songs” convincingly.

Stunning Dance Team

The remainder of the cast is su-
perb. George Chakiris (Bernardo)
and Rita Moreno (Anita) make a
stunning dance team; Russ Tamblyn,
Tucker Smith, and Tony Mordente
lead the Jets with genuine guts and
humor. You will not recognize many
faces among the gangs, but all par-
ticipants are quite professional in
the exuberance and sincerity they
bring to their roles.

The story is simple and moving:
an American boy (Tony) falls in
love with a Puerto Rican girl
(Maria) despite the fierce antago-
nism between their respective ethnic
groups—the Jets and the Sharks.
Tony’s best friend, Riff, is the cocky
leader of the Jets; Maria’s brother
Bernado is his opposite number for
the Sharks. Subsequent events are
touched with rich humor—and, in
the end, excruciating tragedy.

The Flaws

The flaws occur in rare snatches
of dialogue that should have been
left in the cutting room. Viewers
unused to morden dance may feel
that the ballet sequences look a little
out of place on the streets of New
York, but they should remember
that every gesture, every jump,
whirl, and crouch, is the expression
of emotion and depth of character,

revolt against their respective na-
tional governments.

In all aspects of fraternal life, uni-
versity administrations are seizing
more control in an abandonment f
their previous laissez-faire position.
Not content with regulating social
and pledging affairs, feeding and
housing for the fraternities, some
administrations have recently at-
tempted to legislate chapters’ senti-
ments on membership requirements.
Such “legislation” is usually in the
form of an ultimatum to the chapters
involved, setting a deadline for the
removal of bias clauses from the
chapter’s constitutions and by-laws.
Since 1961, for instance, Washington
State University, the University of
California, all the state colleges in
Oregon, Lafayette College, Pennsyl-
vania State University, and North-
western University have imposed
such requirements on their chapters.

Houses Go Local

In the latter case, that of North-
western, it was the university’s IFC
that initiated the anti-discriminatory
proposal. The Northwestern case
cannot actually be defined as an ad-
ministration’s attempt to legislate on
personal prejudices as the school ad-
mitted that “the right of any proper-
ly accredited association to choose
its own members is undeniable.”
Northwestern simply felt that chap-
ters should be free to decide for
themselves about their membership
requirements and not be encumbered
by national restrictions. This in-
stance is by no means characteristic
of many of the membership-legislat-
ing administrations, which often ex-
pect a fraternity to pledge a colored
person or Jew to show “good faith.”

Individually, chapters are taking
the initiative upon themselves for
anti-discriminatory action. In 1961,
the ATO chapter at Stanford Uni-
versity pledged four Jewish boys in
direct defiance of a national order,
and lost its charter after a legal
hassle with ATO headquarters. In
the same year, Kappa Sigma sus-
pended its Swarthmore chapter for
trying to convince other Kappa Sig
chapters to push for a non-discrimi-
natory amendment to the fraternity
constitution.

St. A’s Charter Plane

In October, 1961, the members of
Delta Psi (otherwise known as St.
Anthony Hall) at the University of
Virginia chartered a special plane
and sent five representatives to the
Yale chapter to try to stop the ini-
tiation of a Negro pledge. The Yale
brothers listended politely and then

went right ahead with the initiation.

Two months later, Beta Theta Pi
at Dartmouth servered relations with
its national to protest racial discri-
mination. In 1963, the same step was
taken by Pi Lambda Phi at Brown
and ATO at Bowdoin. Last summer
Sigma Chi lifted the charter of its
Colgate chapter as a result of the
latter’s defiance in initiating several
Jewish pledges.

Democracy Sullied

Naturally, the press has had its
say. The opinionated Christian Cen-
tury, (referring to fraternities) de-
clares that “these snobbish student
organizations profane the word ‘fra-
ternity,’ insult the ideals of academic
community and perpetuate discrim-
ination which sullies the ideals of
American democracy.”

Newsweek is most specific in its
charges. It blames the problem on
“steady-as-you-go Old Grads” and
points at ATO, Sigma Chi, Sigma
Nu, and KA as “the most important
national fraternities with restrictive
covenanis in their chapters.”

In conclusion, it should be pointed
out that the purpose of this article
has not been to recommend a course
of action or level any accusation.
The racial and religious situation is
an important problem facing our
fraternities, and no study of present-
day American fraternities can be
complete without an objective ex-
amination of this problem.

Generals Go To Tennessee; |
Meet Undefeated Sewanee |

Recovering from successive de-
feats at the hands of Susquehanna
and Hampden-Sydney, the Generals
bounced back with a 28-6 win over
Franklin and Marshall last Satur-
day.

Tomorrow they take on the unde-
feated Tigers of Coach Shirley Ma-
jors. Sewanee has given up only
two touchdowns in its bid for the
College Athletic Conference cham-
pionship. Austin College scored in
the opener and Centre managed to
score with less than a minute left
a few weeks ago.

 

The Generals have been hampered

greatly by injuries, many stemming
as far back as the Susquehanna
game three weeks ago. Fullback Dan
Manson will be out for the re-
mainder of the season with a dis-
located shoulder. He aggravated the
injury while filling in for Syd But-
ler in the Franklin and Marshall
game. Butler will probably start of-
fense, but will forgo his defensive
chores.

Halfback Harry Brookby will sit
out this week because of a_ back
injury sustained in the Susquehanna
game. At the other halfback spot, tri-
captain Stu Yoffe will see only de-

SALUTE: BILL WHEATLEY, JR.

To forecast an annual $12 million construction budget is
a difficult job even for an experienced engineer. But Bill
Wheatley, Jr. (B.A.E., 1961), met and mastered this very
challenge soon after he joined The Chesapeake and Potomac
Telephone Company of Maryland in 1961.

To help him with the details, Bill had a staff of eight—
four of them management people. After a year, Bill's super-
visors were so impressed with his work that they selected
him to attend a special business course at Northwestern.
This was followed by a promotion to Staff Accountant

In his new job, Bill conducts public opinion and market
surveys, then carefully analyzes the results for possible ap-
plication by his company. His engineering background
is particularly valuable on the scientific sampling tech-

niques he works with.

Bill Wheatley, Jr., like many young engineers, is im-
patient to make things happen for his company and him-
self. There are few places where such restlessness is more
welcomed or rewarded than in the fast-growing telephone

Poll On New Cut System

(Continued from page 1)

might make an effort to improve
lectures in order to get more stu-
dents to class. For many years stu-
dents have complained that certain
lectures were boring and that a
liberalized cut system would place
a burden on teachers to improve
their lectures; however, only 36 per
cent of those students polled felt
that the new cut system would have
any effect at all on lectures.

Even with more interesting lec-
tures, there is some doubt whether
students will attend certain Satur-
day classes, particularly those oc-
curring during the big weekends.
Seventy-five per cent of the stu-
dents interviewed said they could
foresee certain days when there
would be virtually no one in class.
However, only 50 per cent of the
dean’s list students who have always
had the opportunity to cut more
freely felt that there would exces-
sive cuts on these weekends.

Finally, students were asked if
they thought certain teachers would
penalize students for cutting classes.
Many students stated that there
were already teachers who were af-
fected adversely by one taking one
week of cuts and no doubt the num-
ber would increase when three
weeks of cuts are allowed. An over-
whelming majority of 98.5 per cent
of those questioned thought that
there would be certain classes where

tures of a well-known character.
The origin of the word “Romance”
indicates that these tales developed
in the idom of the people rather
than in Latin. Etymologically ‘the
the words has reference to anything
written in vernacular.

Holmes was severe on those critics
who claim that the Romances are
not organic works, but merely the
ballads of wandering minstrels which
in later times were given “obessive
points of view” to make them over
as they are known today. He called
the Romances “conscious works of
art” and praised the genius of sev-
eral of their authors.

Holmes, one of the foremost au-
thorities on Old French Literature,
has written several important books
in this field. He was awarded the
honorary degree of Doctor of Let-
ters by Washington and Lee in 1948.
Holmes is Kenan Professor of Ro-
mance Philology at the University

 

of North Carolina, where he has
taught since 1925.

becomes increasingly more difficult
to delineate the actions of only priv-

The main point is that there can
be “no abridgement of rights” ‘to
establish religion, freedom of speech,
press, or association; which is clearly
reflected in our federal and state
constitutions. Liberal idealology is
summarized as a belief in a predeter-
mined legal agreement (a constitu-
tion) on the rights of expression and
government a proviso for that
opportunity.

- ‘20 A. M. --- - And Not A Parking Space In a - - - See Editorial Below

 

It is a sad thing that money
does not grow on trees, and
a sadder thing in the eyes of
the journalism department that
the Ring-tum Phi publishes
editorial comments on page
one—but today we feel that
we have a problem worthy of
front page billing. And, it
might be solved with a fairly
minimal expense to the school.
The picture above serves in the
place of any words we might
use to describe the parking
situation here at W&L—it is

deplorable.
A Definite Need

Of course many students are in
a position of being able to walk to
school without any strain—and per-
haps some students who presently
drive would do better to stretch their
legs ocassionally. But above and be-
yond the matter of physical degen-
eration of American youth due to too
much reliance on the automobile, we
have a situation which needs a so-
lution—and we think we have one.

At the right is a drawing of the
land below the Episcopal church and
the school, which fronts on Jefferson
Street. There are two parking lots
on this property—the so-called “Phi
Kap” parking lot, and the Univer-
sity parking area across from Red
Square. We propose that these two
lots be joined, and that the “Phi
Kap” lot be extended to cover
field which is now between it and
the corner of Washington Street and
Jefferson Street. Further, we pro-
pose that once this additional land
is cleared, that the whole mess be
covered with asphalt, and that park-
ing lines be painted in.

 

PLACEMENT NOTICE

Mr .Claude W. Rodgers of Arthur
Andersen & Co. will be on our cam-
pus Thursday, November 14 to inter-
view juniors and seniors interested
in professional employment oppor-
tunities in income taxation offered
by this international firm of ac-
countants and auditors. The company
has offices in the principal cities of
the United States, as well as over-
seas offices in many countries. Un-
dergraduate courses in accounting
are desired, but an accounting major
is not required.

Appointments for interviews must
be made in advance in the Placement
Office, Washington 25

FAST SERVICE

Effective Tuesday a.m. November
12, the east serving line will be
used as “a quick service line” for
those late risers or those desiring
only pastry, juice, fruit, and coffee.
Your food service committee agrees
with the dining hall management
that this arrangement will be ad-
vantageous,

The reason? Inconsiderate drivers
often use two parking spaces, the
lot in front of the school is used
by tourists quite frequently, and in
the winter, it is impossible to clear
the snow off the two present lots
because there is nothing but mud
and loose gravel below the snow.
Cars often get trapped in the snow
and mud, causing even more con-
fusion.

 

ahead with this proposal would take
away from the University’s landscape
as it is seen from Jefferson Street.
If the necessary money could be
raised, however, perhaps a hedge or
boxwood could be planted between
the Jefferson Street sidewalk and
the asphalt parking lot, thus hiding
the lot from the street.
A Long-Standing Problem
There has been a great deal of

over the past few years—and it is
a problem which The Ring-tum Phi
has discussed for almost ten years.
We understand that the Building and
Grounds Office has some plans under
consideration.

one, but we would hope that some-
thing definite could be done within

By DAVID MARCHESE
Tuesday Staff Writer

Note to the reader: the material
used in today’s article was taken
from an interview with Ralph El-

lison in the Paris Review, reprinted

in Interviews of Writers at Work,
published by Viking Press, New
York.

Born in Oklahoma City on March
1, 1914, Mr. Ellison attended Tus-
kegee Institute 1933-1936 where he
was a music major. After a summer
in New York studying sculpture he
abandoned his music studies for
writing and participation in the New
York City Writer’s Project.

Rosenwald Fellow

In 1945, he received a Rosenwald
Fellowship which permitted him to
begin work on his celebrated novel,
Invisible Man, which won the Na-
tional Book Award of 1952.

In 1955, Ellison was awarded the
Prix de Rome Fellowship by the
American Accademy of Arts and Let-
ters. Previously, he had lectured
at the Salzburg, Austra, Seminar in
American Studies. From 1957 to
1961 he was Visiting Lecturer
Literature at Bard College and two
years ago served as the Alexander
White Visiting Professor at the
University of Chicago.

| lison

Mr. Ellison is currently a Board
member of the Institute of Jazz
Studies. Since his childhood, he has
worked as a newsboy, dental assist-
ant, receptionist, jazz trumpeter,
lecturer on literature, and
professional photographer. His prin-
cipal hobby is experimental audio-

electronics.
The interview was. concerned,
among other subjects, with a few

of his ideas involving social protest,
Negro provincialism and “univer-
sality in literature” with its debt to
Negro folklore.

When asked to what degree the
highly regarded theory of social
realism influenced his writing, El-
singled out Malraux as one of
his influences. He considers him
more of a human
Marxian writers and he considers
Malraux to be the artist-revolution-
ary rather than the politician after
writing Man’s Fate.

Art, Not Injustice

He realizes that Malraux’s con-
cern for the tragie struggle of hu-
manity is unlike that of the other
social realists who were concerned
less with tragedy tha nwith injus-
tice. Ellison goes so far as to say
that he, himself, is concerned not
with injustice but with art.

cooperation with 26 professors,

have been named participants in this year’s Robert E. Lee Re-
search program. The professors with their student assistants
are working on 49 research projects, a marked increase over

*the number of projects undertaken
last year.

The Robert E. Lee Research Fund
was established in the fall of 1960
through a gift of more than a quar-
ter of a million dollars by the
late Dr. Gustavus Benz Capito, an
alumnus of the Class of 1899. Funds
are available to encourage well qual-
ified and strongly motivated stu-
dents, while still undergraduates, to
become familiar with research tools,
techniques, and methodology.

The experience is supposed to
broaden the participants’ knowledge
and understanding of how research
and original investigation are con-
ducted. If a student plans to pursue
graduate work, it provides him with
an early introduction to the kind of
research activities usually encoun-
tered for the first time at the gradu-
ate level.

Largest of Its Kind
The program is believed to be the
largest of its kind in U.S. colleges
and universities.

Projects are chiefly of two types:
the assisting of a professor in his
research, or the carrying out of a
plan of research of the undergradu-
ate under the supervision of a pro-
fessor.

A student may be nominated for
a grant by a professor with whom he
is studying. Grant recipients are
known as Robert E. Lee Research
Assistants, those who have and
maintain B averages are designated
Robert E. Lee Research Scholars.
Participation carries no academic
credit, but the grants enable a stu-
dent to earn a portion of the cost
of his education in work that has
unusual educational significance.

The professors and students and
their projects are as follows:

Debate Project

Mr. William W. Chaffin has six
students working under him. They
are Peter Straub, and Edward Fitz-
gerald whose project is “Research
and Assistance in the Debate Pro-
gram”; John Clark and Alfred

Some Praise, And A Reminder

The faculty cut proposal, adopted last week after it
was presented by the Faculty Committee on Courses and
Degrees, is a move which should come close to solving
many of the problems about which both faculty members
and students have been complaining in recent years. Two-
thirds of a year was spent considering a revision of our
present cut system, and in the past few months, a special
faculty committee, under the direction of Professor Wil-
liam M. Hinton, has been drawing up the specific pro-
posal which was published last week in this edition.

A great deal of credit for the proposal belongs to
Professor Hinton’s committee, which was composed of a
vast cross-section of faculty members who represented
every possible view on cutting. On this committee were
young members of the faculty, senior members, professors
who favor unlimited cuts for everyone, and professors
who lean toward a more strict cut system. The work
which they did to make the wording and the contents of
the proposal practical and acceptable deserves the highest
commendation.

Many other faculty members participated in the
formulation of the proposal. Professor Hinton’s commit-
tee was quite painstaking in questioning as many other
members of the faculty as possible so that they might be
able to draw up a truly representative plan. Had they not
done this, it is likely that they would not have met with
such immediate success as they did last Monday. The pro-
posal was in final form at that time, and the questions
which might have come up about it had already been
considered.

Students should note that the penalty for overcutting
under the new system is an automatic “F” for only one
overcut—not two, as in the past three years. It is felt
that since most students will be allowed many more cuts
they will want to take (or should be able to take in a prac-
tical sense), that there should be no instances of over-
cutting. When the automatic “F” for overcutting rule
was instituted in 1960, it was thought that no students
would violate it simply because it is such a severe penalty.
It is hoped that students will take especial note of this rule
under the new cut system, and by using some personal
responsibility prevent the Executive Committee of the
Faculty from having to deal with such an unpleasant
penalty.

Perhaps it is idealistic, but we think it would be a good
idea for all students to be thinking between now and
February about what the purpose of taking a cut really is.
Too often, to be sure, the purpose turns out to be an
extra hour and a half of sleep (especially when the class
is at 8:25), or an earlier start on that road trip. We cannot
eliminate these causes—but the most valid causes would
seem to be needed study time for another class, a pressing
personal problem, or complications with some extra-curri-
cular activity which demands one’s attention during class
hours.

The only real solution seems to be a resolution on the
part of professors to make their lectures an important
enough part of their class so that a student would be
committing academic suicide to cut their class too often.
On the other hand, it is a rather narrow-minded procedure
to dock a student’s grade for excessive cutting if that
particular student is performing capably on his quizzes.

A Clarification

We would like to make it clear that Negro author
Ralph Ellison has been invited to this campus by Profes-
sor Severn Duvall, Chairman of the English Department,
because Mr. Ellison is a distinguished novelist and be-
cause he happened to be in this region and available for
a speaking engagement at this particular time.

 

Gentlemen, May We Present...

Today the Tuesday Editon Features the Executive
Committee of the Student Body. The gallery should be
fairly obvious to the right. The purpose of publishing
individual pictures of each committee member and some
facts about his record is to familiarize all students (and
faculty) with exactly which men on campus make up
this powerful group.

Often a student will go through four years at W&L
without ever knowing the names of more than three or
four of the EC members. Often a student will find him-
self accused of an honor violation and brought before
this committee for a hearing, and see few, if any, familiar
faces. And so we hope that all students will take a close
look at this committee, and at the records of each member.
We intend to make a few remarks in the next few issues
which should do even more to bring the EC down to a
common ground,

In today’s issue, due to lack of space, we have printed
information about only eight of the twelve EC members.
Next week we shall complete the study with members
Bowie, Kulp, Madison, and Rowe.

New Executive Committeemen Boast
Diversity and Scholastic Excellence

By Barry Vaught, Staff Reporter

The following information has been gathered in order to
offer students an easy means by which they can become familiar
with the Executive Committee of the Student body. This is the
first of a series of articles which will explore the nature and the
powers of the Executive Committee in depth. The purpose
of this first number is simply to let students know exactly who
is on the EC, and some vital statistics about each man.

Professor and Student Comment on Negro Author

Ring-tum Phi
Lexington, Virgiina
Dear Sirs:

I certainly wonder along with Mr.
DeJarnette what the intentions are
of the men who invited Novelist
Ellison to W&L. It will be quite
interesting to have on campus a man
who might not be in complete agree-
ment with us, a man who sits on the
other side of the fence.

But then, those writers, those men
who sit on the other side of the
fence, often raise the most astonish-
ing questions, and gosh, I get all
embarrassed.

I hope, as Mr. DeJarnette does,
that Mr. Ellison will “confine him-
self” to “things academic,” because—
well—those current topics are just
more than I can bear—just bringing
them up rubs a sore spot, and
gosh—I’m awfully tender.

Perhaps I ought not to go to Mr.
Ellison’s lecture after all. I guess
I should just retreat a little further
into my shell that night—AGAIN.

Sincerely,

John Samet

Dear Sirs:

In the Friday’s Ring-tum Phi
there appeared a letter by Mr.
Jack DeJarnette which stuck me as
so clear and sensible, that I wish
to praise the author and expand
a little upon his theme.

Mr. DeJarnette suspects that the
coming of Ralph Ellison to speak
here, November 15, on “The Novel
and the American Experience,” is a
move similar to those taken by the
trustees of Sweet Briar and Ran-
dolph-Macon Woman’s College. He
says:

Randolph-Macon Woman’s Col-
lege is trying, despite the ef-
forts of its many loyal alumnae,
to get its Board of Trustees to per-

mit it to accept a Negro applicant.

In this paragraph his implied def-
inition of loyalty to a school is un-
questionably correct: it means noth-
ing but opposition to integration,
while considerations of moral re-
sponsibility, money-drawing power
and educational enrichment are of no
concern, Certainly there are some
alumnae of this nationally famous
woman’s college who favor integra-
tion; they are disloyal by definition.
Admirable semantics!

All future discussions of this
problem will be indebted to Mr.
DeJarnette for another phrase he
has invented. He calls the two
woman's colleges “a bit extreme
when compared to that of [sic|

 

 
    
  
 

time.

Henry Fonda on “That Was the Week that Was”:
“Statistics show that 19 out of every 20 babies born in the
United States are legitimate. This means that your opinion
| of your fellow man is correct only one-twentieth of the

 
  
  

Washington and Lee.” “A bit ex-
treme” works like the pharse
“somewhat massacred” and sug-
gests a whole range of phrases to
describe one’s gradual approach to
any awful prospect: “somewhat
massacred,’ “more massacred,”
and to invoke Shakespeare, “most
massacredest.” Mr. DeJarnette and
I agree that in racial problems no
action is ever anything than “a
bit extreme.”

With as much wit as intelligence,
Mr. DeJarnette continues to chal-
lenge the invitation to Ellison:
“...why not invite a qualified
Chinese, Japanese, or Arab to appear
here?” Who would not rather go
to hear a native of China, Japan, or
Saudi Arabia speak on “The Novel
and the American Experience” in
preference to an American novelist?
The idea is so charming it might
be extended to other fields. For ex-
ample Barry Goldwater might speak
on “The Nature of the Bismuth
Atom,” or Christine Keeler on
“Chasity as a Way of Life.”

Well, says Mr. DeJarnette, if we

Virginians here Saturday. For the winners it was victory num-
ber six as opposed to only two de-*
feats.

The hosts got off to a slow start
before they burst out with a flour-
ish of goals. Tim Henry accounted
for two of the scores while Preben
Berthelsen slammed in the other
two. Henry and Berthelsen were also
in evidence in setting up each others
goals,

Henry played one of his finest
games of the season. He was all over
the field and was passing with sur-
prising accuracy. He was the Roa-
noke goalie’s worst enemy.

The defensive stars were goalie
Tom Green and fullback Dave Red-
mond. Green, who has allowed only
11 goals in the eight games played,
was in his usual form. The Generals
opponents have about come to the
conclusion that facing Green in the
nets is like facing a goal filled with
concrete.

Majors, Agnew Lead Sewanee
Over Five-Star Generals, 35-6

By JAMES CROTHERS
Assistant Sports Editor

Three long fourth-quarter runs by a trio of Sewanee backs
turned what had been a tightly fought contest into somewhat
of a rout Saturday as Washington and Lee’s gridders dropped
a 35-6 CAC decision to the Tennesseans.

A costly fumble and the inability to move once inside the
*Sewanee 20-yard line led to the
Generals third loss in seven games,
as Sewanee rolled to its seventh in
a row.

 

 

After holding the home Tigers on
the first series of downs, W&L took
over, after the punt, on its on 9-yard
line A crushing tackle jarred the
pigskin loose from halfback Tom
Crenshaw’s arms on the Generals’
first play from scrimmage and Se-
wanee recovered. Three plays later
fullback Ray Tucker, plunged over
for six Tiger points and George Con-
dra added the seventh.

Before the Generals could find
themselves again, M. L. Agnew—
Sewanee’s leading ground-gainer
and scorer—had galloped around end
for 39 yards and another Tiger tally.
The Washington and Lee forward
wall settled down for the remaind-
er of the first half and contained
Agnew and Co., while the General
offense tried in vain to score.

kett, the power-running of Skip
Chase and the passing combination

The first period was scoreless but the Baby Generals gained a one to
nothing half-time lead when Jim Cogar scored from close range. Claude
Rogers was given the assist. The same duo combined for the other W&L
goal. With 5:40 left in the game Cogar scored from close range on a long

loose on the first play of the fourth period for a touchdown to start the
ball rolling for their third victory of the year, a 14-6 triumph over Ran-
dolph-Macon Academy Saturday.

With their offense working smoothly,

yards in the air. It takes a pretty
good man to do either. Redmond al-

good distance, breaking up many a

paydirt several times, each to be
stopped short by a determined de-
fense.

the Brigaders came back well
and mid-semester exams to control the

well-executed offensive maneuver.

Berthelsen and Henry are running
away with the scoring honors for the
team thus far. Berthelsen has scored
eight goals and four assists, while
Henry now has five goals and five
assists. Between them they have
accounted for one-half of the team’s
goals and almost one half of the
assists

Tuesday the Generals visit Univer-
sity of Virginia, the defending State
Champions, in the final game before
the State Tournament. A _ victory
could give the Generals the mo-
mentum to go on to the State Cham-
pionship. The prediction from the
records of participants would be
W&L for third place. W&L has lost
to Lynchburg and is not expected
to beat the Cavaliers today, but the
team seems confident that it can
handle Lynchburg in a rematch. The
game today will tell the tale of the
Generals’ chances against Virginia.
Their success in the tournament is
dependent on the offense, which has
been inconsistent thus far. The de-
fense has been consistently excel-
lent all season with Green, Redmond,
Pete Preston, and Howard Busse do-
ing their jobs in fine style. Bruce
Jackson and Wes Horner also saved
Green a lot of trouble by keeping
the ball away from shooting range.

game from the opening kickoff. The*

first touchdown came on a one-yard
run by John Bogart with a full-
back plunge.

The drive started 13 plays earlier
from the W&L 40, with Bogart car-
rying nine times.

After the kickoff to the Randolph-
Macon eleven resulted in a punting
situation three downs later, Phil
Thompson put a hard rush on the
punter and tackled him before he
got a chance to boot. The Brigade
took over on the R-M A 35 and got

rolling with some fine play from!

Bogart, Johnny Grahara and quart-
erback Bryant Kendrick.

Phil Claxton took the ball over
from the one and the extra point
made it 14-0.

R-M A received the kick and on
their first play from scrimmage a
counter netted 70 yards and their
lone TD.

Coach Swan plans to emphasize de-
fense for the Hargrave game com-
ing up this week. It is the Briga-
dier’s finale, and if they win, they
will have a 4-2 mark.

The pep band will be on hand,
and it is hoped most of the freshman
class.

W&L was succesful at taking the
baby ‘Jackets outside game, and
stoping their passing.

second by a shade, with Old Domin-

With the season closing this week
against Fairmont College, the Gen-

must have Ellison, let him speak on
a “purely academic” basis. Again
we are indebted to Mr. DeJarenette
for clarifying an important concept:
what is the “purely academic”?—Mr.
Ellison, you are a teacher of Eng-
lish, and we would like to hear you
divulge the date of the Magna
Charta; or give short plot summaries
of Shapespeare’s plays; or, and this
is a bit extreme, recite the Burns’
poem called, “A man’s a man for a’
that.” But how can any topic which
assumes a connection between art
and life be purely academic? No,
“academic” in the purest sense
denies all connections; so you must
change your topic.

Mr. DeJarnette “cannot help
wondering whether or not HE is
coming for purely academic pur-
poses, no matter what the inten-
tions are of those who invited
him to appear here.” I admit that
the author commits an indiscre-
tion by referring to Ellison with
bold-face caps when custom dic-
tates a more pious use of such
typography. (A not unfair assump-
tion is that the type-setter is in
cahoots with the “who” who in-
vited Ellison).

But the logic of Mr. DeJarnette’s
insinuation is as clear as it is con-
vincing: Ellison is undoubtedly
coming with intentions to demon-
strate the connection between art

and life viewed above as strictly un-
academic, the province of rabble-
rousers, propagandists, crusaders,
money-raisers and other frauds. The
issue is clear: Mr. DeJarnette and I
believe that only those whose lec-
tures completely disregard contem-
porary thought, events and move-
ments ought to be dignified with the
opportunity to address the academy.
This doctrine might well guide the
selection of lecture material in the
Commerce School and the Journal-
ism Department as well as lead
the Religion Department to recon-
sider its invitation to Dr. Samuel E.
Stumpf. He is to talk here, Novem-
ber 12 and 13, on “The Moral Order
and the Legal Order.” Excusible
only if the “orders” his title refers
to were in effect long ago and far
away.

American higher education is to-
day faced with unusual challenges.
One of them, a most extreme one,
is the threat of outsiders like Mar-
tin Luther King, Ralph Ellison, Rus-
sell Kirk, and the Governors Wallace
and Barnette who invade the halls of
ivy with their nasty unacademic
purposes. Confused by these men
(nearly once every two years), how
can a college student “improve his
ability to think—deliberately, crit-
ically, and analytically ...develop
develop new powers of reasoning
that enables him to arrive at sound,
defensible conclusions”? Washing-
ton and Lee Bulletin, 1963-4, p. 15).
If we continue to invite lectures
like Ellison, the University will be
stained with the “discredit or dis-
honor” of caring about contempor-
ary life. If we stop this practice
now, we may all—you and I and Mr.
DeJarnette—join in to sing about
college friendships some day soon
as the ivy slowly creeps past the
last remaining crust of red brick.

SHOULD AULD ACQUAINTANCE he
AND JAZZ LIKE THAT a

T am now an elderly gentleman, full of years and aches, but
my thoughts keep ever turning to my undergraduate days. This
is called “arrested development.”

But I cannot stop the healing tide of nostalgia that washes
over me as I recall those golden campus days, those ivy-covered
buildings (actually, at my college, there was only ivy: no bricks),
those pulse-tingling lectures on John Dryden and Cotton
Mather, the many friends I made, the many deans I bit.

I know some of you are already dreading the day when you
graduate and lose touch with all your merry classmates. It is
my pleasant task today to assure you that it need not be so;
all you have to do is join the Alumni Association and every year
you will receive a bright, newsy, chatty bulletin, chock-full of

tidings about your old buddies.

Oh, what a red-letter day it is at my house, the day the
Alumni Bulletin arrives! I cancel all my engagements, take the
phone off the hook, dismiss my resident osteopath, put the
cheetah outside, and settle down for an evening of pure pleasure
with the Bulletin and (need I add?) a good supply of Marlboro

Cigarettes.

 

 

 

 

 

Whenever I am having fun, a Marlboro makes the fun even
more fun. That filter, that flavor, that yielding soft pack, that
firm Flip Top box, never fails to heighten my pleasure whether
I am playing Double Canfield or watching the radio or knitting
an afghan or enjoying any other diverting pursuit you might
name—except, of course, spear fishing. But then, how much
spear fishing does one do in Clovis, New Mexico, where I live?

But I digress. Let us return to my Alumni Bulletin and the
fascinating news about my old friends and classmates. I quote

frem the current issue:

“Well, fellow alums, it certainly has been a wing-dinger of a
year for us old grads! Remember Mildred Cheddar and Harry
Camembert, those crazy kids who always held hands in Econ II?
Well, they’re married now and living in Clovis, New Mexico,
where Harry rents spear-fishing equipment, and Mildred has just
given birth to a lovely 28-pound daughter, her second in four
months. Nice going, Mildred and Harry!

“Remember Jethro Brie, the man we voted most likely to
succeed? Well, old Jethro is still gathering laurels! Last week
he was voted ‘Motorman of the Year’ by his fellow workers in

the Duluth streetcar system.

‘T owe it all to my brakeman,’

said Jethro in a characteristically modest acceptance speech,

Same old Jethre!

“Probably the most glamorous time had by any of us old
alums was had by Francis Macomber last year. He went on a
big game hunting safari all the way to Africa! We received many
interesting post cards from Francis until he was, alas, acci-
dentally shot and killed by his wife and white hunter. Tough

luck, Francis!

“Wilametta ‘Deadeye’ Macomber, widow of the late beloved
Francis Macomber, was married yesterday to Fred ‘Sureshot’
Sigafoos, white hunter, in a simple double-ring ceremony in
Nairobi. Many happy returns, Wilametta and Fred!

“Well, alums, that just about wraps it up for this year.

Buy bends!”

Old grads, new grads, undergrads, and non-grads all agree:
that good Richmond tobacco recipe, that clean Selectrate

Humphrey
Gives Talk

By REN MANNING

Novelist William Humphrey,
Glasgow visiting professor here
this semester for the fall term,
1963-64, gave the first of a
series of lectures he will de-

liver periodically last night in
Lee Chapel at 8 p.m. In his lecture
he differentiated between the so-
called city-slicker novelist and the
country “hick,” after which he ful-
ly expounded on the importance of
and the manner in which the latter
form of literature developed.

Mr. Humphrey is one of the more
widely acclaimed writers of his gen-
eration, having written such best-
sellers as The Last Husband, a col-
lection of short stories, and Home
From the Hill, which won for him
broad critical acclaim and which was
a success both in its original edition
and later in paperback. He has had
two recent short stories appear in
Esquire and in this September issue
of The Atlantic Monthly.

Imaginative Form of Literature

In his well-attended lecture last
night Mr. Humphrey reiterated again
the statement that the novel is, has
and always will be the only comple-
tely imaginative form of literature.
Especially writers like Hardy, Scott,
Faulkner, and Emily Bronte, whom
Mr. Humphrey classified as “hick”
writers, typify the common, non-
urban middle or lower class, to
which the majority belong. Since the
type of literature these writers create
is of the rural nature, the only
proper way to represent the novel is
through a low style, which would
accordingly, be the style of the per-
sonages. Gradually, this form of lit-
erature grew in popularity and the
possibilities for expression. In con-
clusion, Mr. Humphrey declared
that the common people are another
race entirely, just as the American
Indian for example. This situation
is the same in all countries. They
have their own culture and litera-
ture, both oral and written. It was
the novel which had the primary
step in showing this distinction.

JFK Suggested

For Nomination

Several weeks ago the Mock
Convention Steering Committee
mailed letters to all members of
Congress informing them of the
Convention, The letters were bi-
partisan in content, but Demo-
cratic congresswoman Edith Green
was somewhat surprised to hear
from the Republican student Con-
vention, The resulting story was
printed in last Sunday’s edition of
the Washington Post.

Rep. Edith Green (D-Ore.) re-
ceived a surprise call the other day
for help in promoting Washington
and Lee University’s 1964 Mock Re-
publican National Convention. Since
1908, the university’s famed student
convention have usually called the
turn for the party out of power.
Student Chairman Philip D. Sharp,
Jr., wanted next year to be no ex-
ception.

Mrs. Green, a militant Democrat,
gave the matter some thought. Her
administrative assistant, A. Wesley
Barthelmes, Jr., then sent the fol-
lowing reply:

“Mrs. Green was both startled
and pleased to receive your letter
inviting her to do ‘whatever you
can to assist us’ in assuring the suc-
cess of the 1964 Washington and
Lee Republican Mock Convention.
She also notes with interest your
record of having correctly predict-
ed the outcome of the last presi-
dential elections.

“Being a Democrat of long stand-
ing and wanting to assist you in
continuing your string of successful
predictions, Mrs. Greene suggests
you nominate John F. Kennedy.
Aside from his great abilities and
charm, he is well known by the
public, having occupied the White
House since January, 1961. The best
technique would be to elect by ac-
elamation on the first ballot. Of
course, we Democrats would insist
on first claim upon him as ‘our’
President.”

 

Law Bows

Are law and morality inde-
pendent of each other?

This is the question which
Dr. Samuel E. Stumpf, chair-
man of the Vanderbilt depart-

ment of philosophy, presented
this week in a series of lectures en-
titled, “The Moral Order and the
Legal Order.”

Dr. Stumpf spoke here last Tues-
day and Wednesday under the aus-
pices of the University Christian
Association, the department of re-
ligion and the Student Bar Associa-
tion.

“Law, as I understand it,” Stumpf
said, “is not an independent phe-
nomenon. It is a moral phenom-
enon; thus, it is impossible to con-
ceive of law divorced of moral pro-
cesses. By the time there is a sys-
tem of law, it is freighted with mor-
als.”

Stumpf quoted President Ken-
nedy from a recent speech at
Vanderbilt: “The rule of law is the
essence in our democracy but cer-
tain things in our tradition de-
mand that we take a stand on hu-
man rights. This may bring our
principles into conflict.” Stumpf
felt that our higher duty is to the
moral order, which is not neces-
sarily in conflict with the legal
order,

In order to show how the moral
order impinges on the legal order,
Stumpf divided his Tuesday night
lecture into 1.) the origin of law and
2.) the ends of law.

The philosophy professor remark-
ed that the source of law lay in the
“pathology of legal theory.” In
illustrating the Marxist viewpoint,
he stated that the Marxist may not
have separated the moral and legal
order. To the Marxist historical per-
spective, there evolves a different set
of ideas about law, morals, and re-
ligion as the “dialectic” swings from
the primitive communal society, to
the slave society, the feudal, the
capitalist, and finally in the future
to the true communist state. The
important distinction about Marx,
Stumpf stated, is his claim that all
moral and legal orders stem from
material factors, such factors, for
example ,as production.

Stumpf explained that the theory
of natural law, in direct opposition
to the Marxist theory, has been
another explanation for the origin
of law and morality. Proponents of
this theory maintained that what
governs man’s sense of right is an
innate or pre-existent law.

The interrelationship between law
and morality, Stumpf added, begins
when people start conceiving of
universal laws of behavior.

Stumpf projected what he con-
siders three such universals: 1.) that
promises should be kept; 2) that no
one should deliberately harm an-
other; 3.) that every man _ should
respect what is another’s.

In his Wednesday night lecture,
Stumpf made four comparisons be-
tween the moral and the legal order
to demonstrate that law is a moral
phenomenon. He said that what
we think of religion and morality as

lecture in duPont Auditorium. (Photo by Caro.)

To Morals

Religion Speaker Says

our duty is often bound up with
our legal duty.

First, he defferentiated the two by
stating that the legal order is con-
cerned with man’s external conduct |
as opposed to the moral order which
is concerned with a man’s internal
motives.

Second, the law is concerned with
a minimum moral standard while
morality is concerned with the
righteous man, as a whole. The
scope of law changes from one era
to the next and has recently broad-
ened its scope considerably, he said.
The law has moved in response to
the urge of morals into the field of
morality.

Third, the law is made; moral
principles are discovered. A moral |
rule is found, a law can be made
and repealed; thus, the quality
of morality is categorical and be-
yond repeal. Official recognition
changes a moral rule to a legal one.

As his fourth, differentiation,
Stumpf stated that law and morali-
ty have different degrees of obliga-
tion. The law is not the stand of
our morality. Courts and legal sys-
tems only continue when they have
moral relevance to the times. Thus,
law is a moral phenomenon, obedi-
to the law being a moral act.

Pianist Hummel
To Perform Here

Pianist Stanley Hummel will be
presented in a recital Monday at
8 p.m. in Washington and Lee Uni-
versity ’s Lee Chapel.

The Albany, N. Y., musician,
whose New York debut was made
at the age of 17, has been well
known to concert audiences since
his early childhood. His musical
training included a season’s work at
the Mozarteum in Salzburg, Aus-
tria, and a fellowship which was ex-
tended to six years at the Julliard
Graduate School, where he studied
with Josef Lhevinne.

New York critics have called
Hummel “the kind of pianist who
keeps general concert standards
high,” and “a master of technical
matters” and have described his
playing as “a display of virtuosity
such as is rarely heard.”

Monday's program will include
“Sonata, Op. 53” by Beethoven,
Schumann’s “Carnaval,” Chopin’s
“Etudes, Op. 10, Nos. 3 and 4,” “Re-
flects Dans L’Eeu” and “Fleux
D’Artifice’ by Debussy, William
Schumann's “Three-Score Set” and
“Vision Fugitive” and “Toceata” by
Prokofieff.

The recital, sponsored by Washig-
ton and Lee’s Concert Guild, will be
open to the public. The program is
the second on the University Con-
cert Guild’s 1963-64 schedule.

Ellison To Lecture Tonight
On ‘Novel And Experience’

 

Local SDX
Hosts Meetin g

The Washington and Lee chapter
of Sigma Delta Chi served as under-
graduate host chapter for the annual
convention of the national profes-
sional journalistic society held last
week in Norfolk.

More than 500 persons from pro-
fessional and undergraduate chap-
ters across the nation attended the
54th anniversary convention.

As hosts, the local group helped
the national president of the organ-
ization in a number of ways.

Members of the group also par-
ticipated in the news writing con-
test held for undergraduates.

Charles Flippen, president of the
W&L chapter, won third place in the
contest. Approximately 75 of the na-
tion’s top undergraduate journalism
students competed.

The students had to cover a talk
and press conference given by Dr.
Glenn Seaborg, chairman of the At-
tomiec Energy Commission. Dr. Sea-
borg spoke on the peaceful use of
nuclear power and also announced
that a group of Russian scientists
would tour this country’s non-mil-
itary atomic installations later this
month,

Also speaking to the delegates
were Admiral H. Page Smith, USN,
Supreme Allied Commander At-
lantic; Turner Catledge, managing
editor of The New York Times, and
Mills Godwin, Lt. Gov. of Virgiina.

Walter Cronkite of CBS news, in
a dinner address spoke on the limi-
tations of both press and broadcast
media in reporting the news and
called for closer cooperation between
the two.

Tour of Williamsburg

Among the activities of the four-
day convention were a tour of Wil-
liam and Mary College and Colonial
Williamsburg, a ferry boat tour of
the Chesapeake Bay and inspection
of the Navy atomic aircraft carrier,
the Enterprise.

The convention was held Wednes-
day through Saturday of last week.

John Watts, vice-president of the
W&L chapter, was the chapter’s offi-
cial voting delegate.

The W&L chapter of SDX was
formed in 1929.

In the near future, Flippen, the
current president of the W&L chap-
ter, hopes to be able to sponsor
speakers for public lectures.

Debate Team
Goes To WG M

Washington and Lee is entering
four teams in a _ regional debate
tournament being held this weekend
at William and Mary.

Eight students are at Williams-
burg for the Region 3 Tau Kappa
Alpha-Delta Sigma Rho Tourna-
ment. Tau Kappa Alpha and Delta
Sigma Rho are two of the nation’s

 

largest debating fraternities, and
W&L has a TKA chapter.
The region includes Virginia,

Maryland, West Virginia, Kentucky,
and the District of Columbia. Other,
strong teams at the meet will be
George Washington, American, Ken-
tucky, UVa., William and Mary,
Richmond, Maryland and West Vir-
ginia,

The four W&L teams are Jay
Clark and Jack Eure, affirmative;
Steve Smith and Tod Crowell, af-
firmative; Chuck Levy and Bill
Torrey, negative; Tabor Novak and
Roy Powell, negative. All the teams
except the first, Clark and Eure, are
debating together in a tournament
for the first time.

Debate Coach William Chaffin is
again keeping the strength of the
Washington and Lee debate team out
of the meet by holding Mike Hayslip
and Ed Fitzgerald home. Last
year at the same tournament, Chaf-
fin did not enter the same team
which won the championship two
years in a row.

Next Monday members of the
team will stage an exhibition de-
bate at Randolph-Macon Woman’s
College at Lynchburg.

UCA Introduces

Tutor Services
For Freshmen

This year the University Chris-
tian Association, under the guid-
ance of Dr. Louis Hodges, has com-
piled a list of tutors available to
W&L students.

Each year, Dr. Hodges, explains,
many students who are obviously
able to do well in their courses fail
for reasons other than lack of abil-
ity. The UCA in an attempt to curb
these failures has made up the list
of tutors who are willing to help
students with academic problems at
no cost.

From the faculty, the Association
acquired a list of students who, in
the opinion of the appropriate pro-
fessors, were able to give help in a
specific subject.

From this list the UCA selected a
number of students who were then
contacted and asked if they cared
to volunteer their services. The
names of the students who replied
affirmatively were then placed on a
list which was mimeographed and
given to freshmen, faculty advisors,
fraternity president, and the deans of
the various schools.

Dr .Hodges has pointed out that
the tutors are not only useful to
the failing students, but also to the
student who, although his grades are
not extremely low, feels that they
are definitely below what they
should be, and is willing to work
for the grades he desires.

 

Gamber, Lathrop, Named
To Athletic Committee

The Executive Committee an-
nounced Wednesday the appoint-
ment of Brice Gamber and Robert
Lathrop as student representatives
to the University Committee on
Athletics.

Brice Gamber, a senior from Bal-
timore, Maryland, is President of
the Delta Tau Delta house and a
member of the varsity football
squad. He is also captain of the
baseball team, president of the Var-
sity Club, and vice-president of the
senior class of the Commerce School.

Bob Lathrop, also a Delt, hails
from Haverford, Pennsylvania, and
is freshman soccer coach and assist-
ant varsity coach. As an undergrad-
uate, Lathrop was all-state and all-
conference in soccer. He is now at-
tending law school here.

 

Placement Notice
Wednesday, November 20

Mr. J. Edward Robertson of the
Washington office of Haskins & Sells
will be on our campus to talk to
students interested
counting careers.

in public ac-

*ment of English.

Born in Oklahoma City on March
1, 1914, Mr. Ellison attended Tusk-
gee Institute from 1933 to 1936 where
he was a music major. After a sum-
mer in New York studying sculp-
ture he abandoned his music studies
for writing and participation in the
New York City Writer’s Project.

Rosenwald Fellowship

In 1945, he received a Rosenwald
Fellowship which permitted him to
begin work on his celebrated novel,
Invisible Man, which won the Na-
tional Book Award of 1952.

In 1955, Ellison was awarded the
Prix de Rome Fellowship by the
American Academy of Arts and Let-
ters. Previously, he had lectured at
the Salzburg, Austria, Seminar in
American Studies. From 1957 to 1961
he was Visiting Lecturer in Litera-
ture at Bard College and two years
ago served as the Alexander White
Visiting Professor at the Univer-
sity of Chicago.

Jazz Board Member

Mr. Ellison is currently a Board
Member of the Institute of Jazz
Studies. Since his childhcod, he has
worked as a newsboy, dental assist-
ant, receptionist, jazz trumpeter,
world lecturer on literature and
professional photographer. His prin-
cipal hobby is experimental audio-
electronics.

In an interview by the Paris Re-
view, Ellison was questioned as to
his ideas involving social protest,
Negro provincialism and “universal-
ity in literature” with its debt to
Negro folklore.

When asked to what degree the
highly regarded theory of social
realism influenced his writing, El-
lison singled out Malraux as one
of his influences. He considers him
more of a human artist than most
Marxian writers and he considers
Malraux to be the artist-revolution-
ary rather than the policitican after
writing Man’s Fate.

Art, Not Injustice

He realizes that Malraux’s concern
for the tragic struggle of humanity
is unlike that of the other social
realists who were concerned less
with tragedy than with injustice.
Ellison goes so far as to say that he,
himself, is concerned not with in-
justice but with art.

Later in the interview, when asked
of the tendency of critics to group
novels written by Negroes as so-
called “protest novels,” Ellison
complained that these critics should
eoncern themselves more with the
lack of craftsmanship and the pro-
vineialism which is apparent in
Negro writing.

To Ellison, the much sought-after
“universal theme” in the novel is
reached only by the depiction of the
specific man in a specific circum-
stance. Ellison blames both the Negro
writer and the white reader for
critics’ attitudes toward provincial-
ism; the Negro for “drawing his
blackness too tightly around him
and the white for drawing his white-
ness around himself when he sits
down to read.”

Two Points Of View

How much control should a university have over the
standards of our personal conduct? Last week at Harvard, this
issue was brought rather prominently to the surface by a noted
educator, John Kenneth Galbraith.

A former Ambassador to India, Galbraith stated in a letter
to The Harvard Crimson, the student newspaper, that the
function of a university is not to act as a moral watchdog, but
“to provide the best teaching that can be associated with the
scientific, literary, artistic or other scholarly preoccupations of

the faculty.”

Galbraith, if we may so interpret, maintains that a university
exists for the development of the intellect, not the morality,
of its students. His apparent argument is that by restricting
a student’s freedom, the university is not being realistic. A stu-
dent, if he is to be prepared for life, must be exposed to the
freedom he will experience after he graduates from college;
above all, he must be exposed to the temptations implicit in
this freedom if he is to achieve any sort of immunity from them
when he is on his own. Such is the Galbraithian stand.

With regard to this issue of personal freedom, many stu-
dents feel that W&L presents a definite contradiction. In the
orientation speeches at the beginning of school, freshmen are
addressed as ‘“‘gentlemen.”” They are told that W&L has one
and only one rule—“be a gentleman.’ Yet, to the contrary,
what we face in actuality is quite an elaborate list of rules
and regulations: off-limits rules for girls, prohibition against
drinking on University property, compulsory class attendance,

conventional dress, etc.

Galbraith would criticize this policy. He has explained such
restrictions as the result of “the frustrated maternalism which
lurks . . . in any academic administration.”

Below, in direct contrast to Galbraith, we present a very

cogent and concise argument

analyzing and endorsing the

university’s concern over its student’s moral probity. Here
President John A. Logan of Hollins College takes a realistic
and sober approach to this question of freedom versus restric-
tion. “True freedom,” he states, “‘comes through commit-
ment... it cannot be found in aimless hedonism or irrespon-

sible drift.”

For a broadened insight of this stand, we urge you to ana-

lyze the article below.

 

Faculty Members Evaluate W&L Fraternities

By WARREN MONTGOMERY

It is felt by many students here
that generally speaking, the W&L
faculty is hostile to our fraternities
and is trying by overt or more
subtle means to limit or abolish
them altogether. However, in trying
to get a representative sampling of
professors’ opinions on fraternities,
it was impossible to find even one
who is really “anti-fraternity,”
though all had some criticisms to
make.

Three of our faculty members were
interviewed, being asked if they had
any criticisms on fraternities and if
so, should any action be taken to
correct any faults.

Dr. Spencer

Dr. Edgar W. Spencer, Professor
of Geology has this to say about
fraternities: “First of all, ask the
question, ‘What kind of school do
we want W&L to be?’ Obviously,
there are different answers. A num-
ber of people want an outstanding
academic institution. Other people
want a very elite social club.

“The people who want the school
to be outstanding academically are
generally not very happy with fra-
ternities, one of the principal criti-
cisms being that fraternities play an
extremely important role in the life
of the member, and indirectly in the
lives of non-members. Most of the
social life and extracurricular activ-
ities are controlled by fraternities.
Therefore, fraternities should assume
greater responsibility in intellectual
and academic phases of the univer-
sity. They might establish higher
academic standards for their mem-
bers and lend support to activities
that are not strictly social.

“There are two things, essential-
ly, that could be done to change
the university in the direction of
emphasizing academic life over
social. One thing that could be
done would be to modify the ex-
isting environment by changing
the fraternity system. Possibilities
here would be to institute a defer-
red rushing system or more string-
ent restrictions on fraternity ac-
tivities if the fraternities refuse
to institute reforms of their own.

 

Hollins’ President Speaks Out

Should Colleges Exert Moral Discipline?

(This being National Education
week, The Friday Ring-tum Phi
would like to focus on a major
academic issue—that of education
and morality. Followimg are ex-
cerpts from an address delivered
by President Logan of Hollins at
the institution’s commencement
last June. Editor)

By JOHN A. LOGAN, JR.
President, Hollins College

Americans as a people are given
to critical introspection, and it is
to our credit that despite frequent
public claims to perfection, we are
perpetually engaged in a tireless
analysis of our faults. On the whole
this is a healthy and sobering ex-
ercise, and there is considerable
cause for concern, both in the areas
of public and private morality, if
we survey the evidence.

Pressure To Relax Rules

On college campuses the general
moral flabbiness of our society is re-
flected in the destructive and dis-
turbing riots last spring which can
hardly be passed off as “spring
fever,” or “Vassar students’ strong
negative reaction to Miss Blanding’s
outspoken condemnation of exces-
sive drinking and sexual promis-
cuity, which she accompanied with
a threat of dismissal.” Almost every
college administration reports in-
creasing pressure from students to
relax rules and regulations on
smoking, drinking, cars, visiting
hours, and curfews, while the whole
question of how far the college
should act in loco parentis has been
the subject of heated debate on
campuses across the nation. We are
thus paradoxically confronted with
demands for more freedom in the
fact of a declining acceptance of
responsibility.

At the center of this problem is
the generally sorry condition of
the American family as a focus of
moral authority. Haunted by ill-
digested Freudian strictures against
parental repression, bedevilled by
the “progressive” cult of self-ex-
pression, urged toward permissive-
ness and beguiled by false doctrines
of family democracy, parents have
to often abdicated their responsi-
bility for setting standards of be-
havior and limitations on _ their
children’s freedom of action. Afraid
of inducing trauma, or of being
unpopular with their children or
their children’s friends, they have
yielded to demands for privileges
and liberties which are clearly

 

harmful, and for which the only
excuse is that the other parents al-
low their offspring this license. In
so doing, these adults are robbing
their children of an essential part
of their education by failing to pro-
vide clear measures of right and
wrong and values based on some-
thing firmer than the whims of the
crowd. It is an ethic which says
that because a good many people
are doing something, it is normal
and somehow, therefore, right.

Parents Turn to Schools

Under these circumstances it is
understandable that a great many
parents, aware of the dangers but
helpless to cope with the situation,
have turned to the schools to exert
the guidance and discipline they
cannot provide. I hasten to say that
this is too great a burden to place
on the schools whose main purpose
is, and must remain academic, but
in any case the schools may prove
to be a broken reed. Futhermore,
the school, or college for that mat-
ter can only build on moral foun-
dations that have been firmly laid
at home. There is no substitute for
inner controls and a strong sense
of responsibility. It must be made
clear that rules are made to pro-
tect young people from hurting
themselves, not simply to keep
them from having fun. We must
also rid ourselves of some of our
worship and indulgence of youth and
the false notion that fun is an end
in itself, rather than a by-product
of doing hard things well, or we will
transfer ourselves into a society of
adolescents.

I have been accused of old-fogey-
ism for advocating a return to the
“outmoded” coneept that “father
knows best.” Of course parents are
not infallible, but the odds are with
them. The odds are also with Miss
Blanding against the Vassar students
and no responsible college official
would disagree with her in principle.
The “right to make one’s own mis-
takes” is an absurd rallying cry.
We all make some mistakes unavoid-
ably, but what is the use of studying
the history of human society if each
generation must repeat the errors of
the past? When a mode of behavior
is proved harmful, society prohibits
it. Granted that adults misbehave,
the freedom they enjoy is still cir-
cumscribed, and such freedom as
they have is based on the assumption
of knowledge and experience suffi-
cient to exercise the privilege wisely.
Colleges, therefore, have a legal and

moral duty to parent and student
as well to act in loco parentis.

Never Complete Freedom

I am often stuck by the tendency
of the young to overestimate the
amount of freedom one enjoys as
an adult. Most of you are now pass-
ing through the freest period of
your lives. When you marry you
will enter into a web of obligation to
your husband and children and
through them to the community
that can and should be richly re-
warding, but which will be inces-
santly demanding. Those of you who
pursue careers will be bound to
the restraints of the clock and the
job, deadlines and bosses. Every
human connection imposes respon-
sibilities, real or imagined; every
society makes its demands, sets its
limits, compels its own sort of con-
formity in behavior.

Freedom Through Commitment

The point I am making is that,
paradoxical though it may seem, true
freedom comes through commit-
ment—commitment to people, to
ideas, to causes greater than one-
self. Freedom lies in being able to
choose an area of engagement and
intense interest, it cannot be found
in aimless hedonism or irresponsible
drift. The joys of freedom reside
in using one’s powers to the full
in the service of some worthy en-
terprise that commands all one’s
depth of conviction and devotion.
We are happiest when we are fully
used, and it is the boredom and
frustration of disengagement that
makes us querulous and pety and
mean,

Achieve Through Discipline

No quality is more rare or valu-
able than a capacity for decision
The human mind shrinks from hard
choices, from self-denial and ex-
posed moral positions. The notion of
duty has almost become outmoded
in the modern lexicon linked as it
frequently is with inhibitions and
guilt feelings, until one would
think a sense of obligation is in-
evitably unhealthy. All this is non-
sense, of course. Every enduring
achievement of mankind is the
product of a disciplined mind and
will and imagination. What we have
to deal with at college are the finely
wrought and noble conceptions of
that exceptional discipline we call
genius. It is a wonderful adventure,
and I wish you good fortune in your

 

quest.

change in the character of the stu-
dent body by virtue of their interest,
abilities, and motivation and _ to
eliminate those not interested in
getting as much as they can out of
their college educations.

“This process almost certainly will
take place, even without a univer-
sity policy, simply by virtue of the
inereasing number of college appli-
cants.”

Professor Gunn

Assistant Professor of Commerce
John M. Gunn commented, “First of
all, the fact of living-groups is go-
ing to exist in any residential col-
legiate institution. Now whether
these living groups are organized
formally, or how they are organ-
ized, or what values and tastes they
seek to serve are questions that are
subject to wide variations. I believe
that the particular form of organ-
ization of the American collegiate
fraternity system has enormous po-
tential for the development of col-
lege men as well as for their pleas-
ure. It is also apparent that the
potential for development is little
realized. There are also certain per-
sistant damages in the fraternity sys-
tem and possible dangers.

“Thus the task for fraternity
men is to exploit their opportuni-
ties while supressing the damag-
ing effects. The opportunities es-
pecially consist of the use of the
institution of brotherhood for the
mutual. development—construc-
tive development—of its mem-
bers — their personalities, their
characters, and their intellectual
qualities.

“The harmful effects to be es-
pecially avoided are the damages to
the men not elected by the system
and the creation of false values in
those who are, such as prestige for
prestige’s sake.

“Provided that it could be done
without coersion by the university,
either actual or implied, I would be
delighted by machinery to insure the
opportunity of fraternity member-

 

“A second approach is to admit| ship for every man who wanted it—
only those who would bring about a!

a system undertaken by the frater-
nities themselves because they rec-
ognized the benefits it would have
for the student body as a whole.
Pledge training prgrams could easi-
ly be made more constructive with
total avoidance of obscenities and of
hazardous physical hazing. (The
pledges themselves could put a stop
to such practices simply by refusing
to tolerate them. There is no frater-
nity that could make even a token
fight against pledges refusing to
be abused, especially if the pledges
were a bit organized.)

 

“IT am among those who believe
that a deferred rushing period would
be beneficial provided mechanics
could be worked out that would not
interfere too much with the aca-
demic program of ithe university.”

Dr. Coulling

Finally Dr. S. M. B. Coulling, As-
sociate Professor of English was in-

Questioned,

Trustees Present ‘Oligarchy’

By ROD COCKSHUTT

What is it that distinguishes an
independent university such as
Washington and Lee from a school
supported and controlled either by
a state or by some religious denom-
ination? This question was raised
during dinner the other evening by
Dr. Samuel E. Stumpf of Vanderbilt,
who lectured on campus this week.

Most of us present at that time
agreed that freedom was the dis-
tinguishing characteristic of the in-
dependent university: the freedom
of professors to teach their subjects
as they choose to; the freedom of
students to follow the truth
wherever and however it might lead
them; the freedom of the university
as a whole to move boldly, to ex-
periment, to play with new ideas—
always without fear of censure by
either legislature, regents, or pa-
rochial hierarchy.

It seems almost too trite to say
that freedom always entails a re-
sponsibility. That responsibility
which the independent university
has is simply to be what it claims
to be; that is, independent. It
ought to exercise constructively and
positively the freedom it enjoys.

 

Otherwise its independence exists in
name only.

Seen in this light we might well
wonder about the nature of Wash-
ington and Lee’s “independence.”
It is evident that rather than being
truly independent, this University
is ultimately and omnipotently con-
trolled by a self-perpetuating oli-
garchy we call the Board of Trus-
tees. The power of decision on all
matters of crucial importance to the
University rests finally with them.
Everything that matters here then
is really at the mercy of their own
economic, social and political views.
There is no fundamental indepen-
dence here.

For instance, when it come to in-
viting Negro leader Dr. Martin
Luther King to campus, our Board
flatly prohibited such an invitation,
despite substantial student and fac-
ulty disapproval of such action. The
University of Virginia, on the other
hand, has permitted not only Dr.
King but also Gus Hall of the Amer-
ican Communist Party, George Lin-
coln Rockwell of the Nazi Party and
other controversial personalities to
speak openly on that campus. Here

Booters Vie In State Tourney

Washington and Lee’s_booters
moved into Charlottesville this
morning with the state’s finest de-
fensive team and highest individual
scorer yet must be content to paly
the darkhorse role in the State Soc-
cer Tournament.

The Generals, ranked number
three behind Virginia and Lynch-
burg College, met  sixth-ranked
VPI this morning at 10 in the open-
ing round of the two-day tourna-
ment, which was started in 1959 by
W&L Coach Joe Lyles. The booters
swept past the Techmen 5-0 during
the regular season and are expected
to do the same today.

If the Generals beat VPI, they
must face the Hornets of Lynch-
burg College. Lynchburg stung W&L
for one of its three regular season
losses and enters the 1 p.m. game
with an 11-2-1 record. “Our boys
are raring to get at Lynchburg,” said
coach Lyles yesterday in a R-t P
interview. “They beat us in the last
four minutes of our first game 1-0.
The main problem with this game
could stem from the fact that we
have to play at 9 am. and again
at 1 p.m. This means our halfbacks
and wings will be running about
fifteen miles in a period of less than
six hours.”

The locals, who have only five
reserves, must hope for a runaway
Tech game in order to rest for the
key encounter with Lynchburg. The
Hornets are a short passing team
who try to tire their opponents.
They are led by high scoring cap-
tain Billy Howard who booted a
final minute goal Tuesday to give
LC a 1-1 tie with Roanoke College,
a team that the Generals desposed of

 

handily Saturday, 4-1.

The W&L-LC game will probably
determine who is to meet defend-
ing state champion, Virginia, in the
finals at 2:30 on Saturday. Virginia
must overcome the winner of the
Roanoke-Randolph-Macon contest.

The Washington and Lee squad,
although only 17 strong, has three
All-Staters from last year— goalie
captain Tom Green, halfback Bruce
Jackson, and center-forward Tim
Henry.

Green has been outstanding this
season allowing only 14 goals in
9 games. He will head the defen-
sive sector of the booters’ squad
which has received state-wide ac-
claim as “very tough.” Fullbacks
Howard Busse and Dave Redmond
are what coach Lyles calls the
“Key to his defense.” They have
performed particularly well making
Green’s job much easier.

Offensively, the Generals have
been helped tremendously by Pre-
ben Berthelsen, a foreign student
from Denmark. “The great Dane”
leads the state in scoring with 9
goals and has provided 5 assists.

 

 

Generals Meet Southwestern

Southwestern comes to Lexington
tomorrow to take on the revenge
seeking Generals in W&L’s final
home game of the season. Against
Sewanee last week the Generals
came out on the short end of a 35-6
decision on the Tiger’s home field.

Still not fully recovered from in-
juries, the Generals will be especial-
ly weak through the center of the

“He can move around players|

than any other player I’ve ever|
coached,” commented Lyles. “He |
not only moves well but he seems |
to have a knack of hitting the goal

Berthelsen combines with Henry
to give W&L one of the state’s
outstanding offensive combinations.
The two have combined to score
over half of the local goals.

Washington and Lee is very strong
on offense and even stronger on
defense. The Generals may decide to

line as they take on the Lynx of
Coach Jessy Johnson. Missing at
guard will be seniors Bill Angel and
Steve Davenport, junior Bo Ernest
and sophomore Tom Day. All except
Angel are expected to be in shape for
the Generals’ final game against
Washington University next week.
Filling in at guard will be senior
Mike Levin and sophomore Charlie
Mayer.

The Generals will be running
against a fairly heavy line, averaging
about 200 pounds and _ especially
strong on the ends. The W&L line
is some what lighter, with not one
man over 200 pounds.

Southwestern has a good running

 

game, but excels in its passing.

Quarterback Bert Chafin has three
prime targets, halfback Scott Halford
and Bill Harwood, and end Vince
Kouns. Chafin is also a fine runner
and will be deadly on the pass-run
option. Harwood, who is also the
Lynx kicker, has found that he
achieves greater distance using
a soecer kick, by which the ball is
booted off the side of his foot.

In past performances Southwestern
has a 2-4-2 record this season and
2-1-1 record against W&L. They
scored 19 points against Washington
and outgained Sewanee in the first
half. But as in the Generals’ en-
counter with the Tigers, the score
was not indicative of the closeness of
the game, the Lynx losing 28-0.

 

Faculty Vs. Students

The W&L faculty will take on the
Fraternity All-Stars in a_ benefit
basketball game at 8:15, December 5.
Admission will be $1 with the pro-
ceeds going to W&L’s charter mem-
bership in the Basketball Hall of
Fame. The event is sponsored by
the Varsity Club.

Frank Parsons will serve as man-
ager of the faculty team, and is
now in the process of contracting
Dr. Keith Shillington as _ coach.
Prospective starters for the facul-
ty include Mr. Baine Fox, Dr. Jay
Cook, Dr. Charles Phillips, and Dr.
Edward Atwood.

Serving as manager of the All-
Stars will be Coach Buck Leslie with
senior law student Wyatt Durette as
the coach. The All-Star team has

Washington and Lee remain singu-
larly silent on this University’s poli-
cy concerning the admission of
Negro students. Here was another
opportunity for Washington and Lee
to demonstrate its independence by
exercising courageous leadership on
a touchy issue. And here again we
failed.

All the new dormitories, dining |
halls, science buildings and research
grants in the world cannot help
Washington and Lee to become a
great University, a force for leader-
ship in the “New South,” if the
spirit of vitality and daring is ab-
sent, as it appears to be, in that
body which possesses ultimate au-
thority over the University.

is increasingly filtering down to the
juniors. Since freshmen can’t partic-
ipate as fully in fraternity activities
as they once could, this leaves fra-
ternities pretty well dominated by
a single class, the sophomores.”

Dr. Coulling explained this de-
creasing undergraduate interest on
the grounds that many members
live in apartments because frater-
nity houses are not such attractive
places to live in as they once were;
today’s students have broader so-
cial interests which take them away
from the house; there are more uni-
versity provided activities such as
lectures, concerts, independent re-
search, and individual interests to
keep students busy; and early mar-

riages take members away from
active participation.
“Fraternities,” continues Dr.

Coulling, “clearly are not what
they once were. This can be borne
out by statistical data: the per-
centage of students who pledge
fraternities in the fall is decreas-
ing, fraternity houses are hav-
ing a more difficult time finding
tenants for all the rooms in the
houses, and I would imagine that
the percentage of really active
membership is decreasing.

‘Fraternities have to face a dual
problem—they must strengthen their
position on campus in the face of
student apathy and in the face of
nationwide _ criticism. Nationally,
fraternities are accused of being un-
democratic” and of being a distrac-
tion at W&L.

“I think that the solution to the
fraternities’ problems is for mem-
bers to mature emotionally and in-
tellectually. Childish hazing, and a
long succession of parties that lead
to satiety becoming boring. When
frantic partying every weekend be-
comes the exclusive form of diver-
sion, a social monotony occurs. At
one time, this kind of fare might
have sufficed, but an increasingly
large number of students are finding
that fraternities are not adequately

satisfying their needs. What I mean
is that the range and interests of
fraternities is limited; the social life
tends to be a monotonous succes-
sion of the same kind of activity. If
the fraternities are really to over-
come student activity, they will have
to think up something besides party
fare.

“The other side of the coin is
meeting the criticism that fraterni-
ties are distractions from what is the
primary importance of academic
life, and I think the way to meet
this criticism is for fraternities to
participate increasingly in the aca-
demic life of the University. Spe-
cifically, they can assist freshmen
in their studies rather than sending
them out on rallies. They can assist
by participating in activities out-
side the classroom, such as lectures,
research projects, and concerts which
are part of the intellectual and cul-
tural life of a university.

“And finally, through a_ variety
of means, such as dinners, recep-
tions, informal coffees, etc., the fra-
ternities can promote a closer and a
warmer relationship among stu-
dents and faculty and then bring
the entire academic community more
closely together.”

Assimilation Committee Should Be Abolished

Editor’s Note: The following let-
ter was composed by several mem-~
bers of the Assimilation Commit-
tee and the Executive Committee,
and it bears the signature of sev-
eral other students from those two
committees who have discussed it
with the originators.

To the Student Body:

It is the opinion of the under-
signed that there has arisen, over a
period of years, a pressing need for
a reappraisal of the Assimilation
Committee. The chief function of
the Committee, as is well known,
is to help preserve the traditions of
Washington and Lee— in particular
that tradition known as conventional
dress. We believe, however, that this
presents a paradox in terms. How
can conventional dress be a tradition
if, in fact, it must be enforced? The
obvious answer is that it cannct.

We are left with a rule rather
than a tradition. Thus, the purpose

 

of the Assimilation Committee may
be stated differently. The Committee
is an appointed group of students
whose duty is to enforce convention-
al dress. As it is set up, however, the
Committee merely punishes offend-
ers; the responsibility to inform the
committee of violations lies with the
student body. Therefore, it becomes
apparent that if the student body
does not support the Committee, the
Committee is an ineffectual organi-
zation, failing in its purpose.

Our opinion is that this is the
case at present. Probably less than
five per cent of the students re-
port violations with any semblance
of regularity. It is absurd to be-
lieve, then, that the student body
honestly supports the Assimilation
Committee. Why? Because they
believe, we think, that traditional
dress should be upheld as a tra-
dition, not enforced as a rule.
There is, and has been, a grow-

 

ing resentment towards the Com-
mittee and the “rule” of conven-
tional dress.

For these reasons we belive there
is a definite need for reappraisal
by the student body of the value
of this committee. As individuals we
have thoroughly considered the
problem, and as a group of individ-
uals we have come to a conclusion.

We should like to see the tradi-
tion of conventional dress establish-
ed and the rule eliminated. We be-
lieve the Assimilation Committee is
(1) unable to effectively enforce the
rule, and (2) by its existence is a
contradiction to the tradition. We
believe the Assimilation Commit-
tee should be disbanded.

We feel by doing so that gentle-
manly dress would become a tradi-
tion; that proper appearance would
become an ideal in which the stu-
dent body could take pride, rather
than a rule to which they take of-

 

fence. We believe that conventional
attire would become more meaning-
ful and certainly more respected.
Surely some might take advantage
of this new freedom were it allowed.
Yet we believe that exceptions will
be rare, if not because of desire to
abide by the tradition, because of
pure social pressure.

At the present time, the Univer-
sity of Virginia, even though it is
larger and less selective than W&L,
has conventional dress, and their
tradition is succeeding without an
enforcing body. The real fact is that
most Washington and Lee students
support the conventional dress now
because it is a tradition, and not
because it is a rule.

We believe that disbanding the
committee will eliminate com-
plaints about the rule, and help
destroy resentment towards gen-
tlemanly attire. It will leave the
tradition to stand on its own mer-

 

its to be supported by each indi-

vidual member of the student
body. If, however, the trandition
cannot stand, several facts will
have been illustrated: (1) that the
students body does not favor con-
centional dress, and (2) that the
administration, if it desires the
rule, will be responsible for en-
forcing it.

In summary, we will restate that
we do believe in gentlemanly dress
as a tradition. Proper attire is the
mark of a gentleman. It develops a
formal class atmosphere, and con-
duces to a serious attitude towards
education. It presents a pleasant,
mature appearance not only to the
students, but to the dates, parents,
alumni, and other campus visitors.
It illustrates that it is not necessary
to flout all convention in order to
keep one’s individuality.

We have studied the problem and
examined the apparent need. It is

our opinion that disbanding the
Assimilation Committee offers the
best solution. However, our main
concern is merely to express our
opinion so that you, the student
body, might be coaxed into reap-
praising the situation, and into de-
ciding for yourselves. We ask you
to make your own opinion known.

Sincerely,

Assimilation Committee; Stuart
Finestone, Freshman Member,

‘Ballad Of Jesse Neighbor’ |
Story Read By Humphrey |

By HOWARD EPSTEIN
Tuesday Staff Reporter

Novelist William Humphrey, Glas-
gow visiting professor for the fall
term, delivered his first of fcur read-
ings on this campus yesterday by
reading “The Ballad of Jesse Neigh-
bor,” one of his recent short stories.

Mr. Humphrey, author of The
Last Husband, a collection of short
stories, and Home from the Hill,
presented a reading followed by an
informal discussion of several of his
methods of writing. The program
took place in the journalism class-
room of Payne Hall at 4 p.m.

Recent Theme

At the outset of the reading Mr.
Humphrey pointed out that “The
Ballad of Jesse Neighbor” was one
of several of his recent short stories
that concern the penniless Oklahoma
farmer of the 30’s who did not be-
come an overnight millionaire when
oil was discovered in the West.
His stories picture the lives of the
people to whom oil brought tragedy
instead of happiness.

Jesse Neighbor is a son of an in-
solvent Oklahoma farmer who owns
no land. His bride-to-be is the
daughter of a more wealthy farmer
who declares that Jesse must find a
home for his future family before
marriage. To achieve this end, Jesse
and his future bride work diligently
to secure the needed home: Jesse
stops smoking and saves his tobacco
money for a mule, he finds a share-
cropper’s cabin and land, and works
almost savagely with dedicated in-
dustry.

 

“Black Gold”

At this point, the story seems to
be one of the ambitious youth who
made his fortune with sweat and
patience, but it is here that Hum-
phrey adds the irony of “black gold.”
For instead of boosting Jesse to-
wards his goal, the discovery of oil
crushes his hopes and wastes his
efforts. Like many who have just
struck oil, the father of Jesse’s
future bride, rushes to the city and
returns a new man in a new class.
Marriage is now impossible.

With Jesse’s goal destroyed, his
life follows a steady decline until,
in search of fame and wealth, he
attempts to rob a bank. Caught, he is
tried, convicted of a capital offense,
and executed.

Glasgow Lecturer

Mr. Humphrey’s stay here for the
fall semester is sponsored by the
Glasgow Endowment Program.
which, since its birth in 1955, has
seen reside here such writers as
Katherine Anne Porter, John Ciardi,
and Merle Miller, along with Ed-
ward Albee, Richard Eberhart, Rob-
ert Lowell and Howard Nemerov.

During the rest of the fall term,
along with his lectures, Mr. Hum-
phrey has scheduled three more
readings: November 25, December
2, and 16. All of the readings will
be in the journalism classroom of
Payne Hall at 4 p.m.

Humphrey, a native of Texas, was
born in 1924. He taught at Bard
College for eight years. Since early
1961, Humphrey and his wife have
been living in Europe.

Negro Author
Packs Chapel

By ROGER PAINE
Editor-in-Chief
Ralph Ellison, author of
Invisible Man, delivered a
lengthy, discursive lecture on

Friday night to an audience
which almost filled the pews in Lee
Chapel. His topics ranged from child-
hood memories of friends named af-
ter Lee and Washington to a discus-
sion of sociology of early America,
to a final encomium for the late
William Faulkner.

No High Point

There was no center of attention
for Ellison’s talk—he dealt with
American literature in general, but
he mentioned very few authors by
name. In deed, although he alluded
to The Red Badge of Courage, to
Hemingway, and to Faulkner, most
often he left it up to the audience
to determine exactly what or whom
he was talking about.

Ellison said that the American ex-
perience, as he called it, began in a
land mass with plenty of room for
expansion. The framers of the consti-
tution had said exactly what sort
of nation they wanted, but their
ideals were to run up against the
irrevocable past. Speaking without
notes, Ellison said that America
found that she could postpone fac-
ing up to certain contradictions be-
tween her ideals as stated in the
constitution and the actual way of
life in the new states because the
country was expanding.

White Minstrels, Black Faces

Wandering to the development of
the “American” as opposed to the
“English” language, Ellison mem-
tioned the white minstrels of the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,
who absorbed the Negro way of us-
ing the language, the Negro songs,
etc. The mixture of black and white
started with white minstrels paint-
ing their faces black, and adopting
black mannerisms for their perfor-
mances, and the black minstrels
dressed like Uncle Sam.

Naming the nineteenth century as
the period in which American writ-
ers first began to try to define the
American ways of life—to “create
ourselves,” Ellison said that the
early novelists, while drawn into the
American ideal, were also insisting
| that the nation face up to certain re-
| alities, certain contradictions in her
way of life.

The Civil War

These contradictions came to a
| head in the War Between the States.
| Suddenly, said Ellison, Americans
who were committed to making a
more human way of life found that
they could not continue without
| warfare. When the clash occurred, it
| Was perahps the novelist who un-
derstood best what was happening.
“Glorious warfare” had come to an
end—“total warfare’ was the new
look. Both the poet and the novelist
saw this, and wrote about it.

The Civil War forced Americans
to face a problem which they could

The EC: Too Much Power?

This week, the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi completes its
introduction of current Executive Committeemen. We
should like also to glance briefly at the powers and func-
tions of the EC itself, and to comment upon those powers.

Actually, the EC is student government at Washing-
ton and Lee. It has absolute control, first of all, over the
execution of the Honor System. In addition to deciding
what a violation of the system is, and deciding as well
whether or not a particular incident constitutes a violation,
the EC has sole control over Honor System procedure—
thus it not only defends the system, but defines it.

Committees Controlled

Every student committee with any real governmental
powers is appointed by the 12 men on the Executive
Committee; furthermore, any decision of one of these
committees (Assimilation, Cold Check, Student Control
and Library), is subject to the EC’s veto. Also, the various
committees have no ultimate means of dealing with of-
fenders except turning them over to the EC.

(The only really functioning student committee not
appointed by the EC is the Publications Board, composed
of editors and business managers of campus publications
and two faculty members. But even here the EC has ulti-
mate authority. They can, if they so decide, oust any editor
or business manager appointed by the Publications

Board.)
No Structural Checks

Structurally, the EC has no checks on it whatsoever.
Press representation at meetings, while nominally allowed,
really is controlled by the Committee. At any time, the
Committee can decide to go into “executive session,”
which means any outsiders must be expelled from EC
chambers.

While certain instances would appear to warrant pri-
vate meetings, the EC has to give no reasons, no explana-
tions for executive session, and could theoretically de-
clare every meeting closed.

‘Its Own Authority’

Let’s view for a moment what we have just observed.
The Executive Committee has absolute authority in every
realm of student government. It is executive, in that it
enforces rules and regulations; it is legislative, in that it
creates committees and defines rules of behavior; and it
is judicial, in that it judges violations and interprets regu-
lations.

It is its own source of authority, its own source of
control—the EC defines its own scope of influence, and
decides what controls should be exercised over it; thereby
controlling the potential “controls” over it.

These 12 men, then, have for all practical purposes
the power to manipulate as they so choose the whole of
student governmental activity.

Who are they, how are they chosen, and do they
really represent the student body?

Candidate Selection

The Executive Committee candidates are chosen by
the party cliques — Progressive and University; this
amounts to nine fraternity representatives in each party,
in one evening’s political dealings, coming up with a slate
of candidates. The student body is then allowed to elect
“representatives” from the candidates that the two bodies
of nine men have selected for them. At least three of the
EC members—the law school representatives—are not di-
rectly attached to the student body and among the three
of them represent 100 law students, many of whom were
not at W&L as undergraduates. On the present commit-
tee, two of the three law representatives did not spend
their undergraduate careers here.

It appears from the above that what we have is not a
representative student government at all. We put in the
hands of a select few men absolute authority over us.

Power Distribution Necessary

Our criticism here is not with the committee members;
they, we feel sure, live up to their responsibilities as con-
scientiously as possible. Our criticism is, rather, with the
structure—we feel that too much power is in the hands of
too few students; we feel that there are more than 12
qualified leaders at Washington and Lee; we feel that a
distribution of powers would serve to democratize student
government, provide necessary checks on the EC, and re-
vitalize student interest in that it would give them the
opportunity for political activity and expression they are
denied now.

Next week, we shall amplify just what we mean by

“distribution of powers,” suggesting some concrete pos-
sibilities for modifying the present system.

Conservatives Evaluate New Bill
In Light of State Voting Rights

By WILLIAM BRAITHWAITE
and WAYTT D. DURETTE, JR.

We were asked to comment this
week on the Civil Rights Bill.

Let us specify at the beginning
what we argue about: it is not the
morality or immorality of any kind
of discrimination on the basis of
race, but rather the way the law
shall deal, if at all, with such dis-
crimination. It is, in a word, the
means, and not the ends, of which
we speak.

Unconstitutional

We believe the bill would be an
unconstitutional assumption by the
federal government of the states’
power to determine voter qualifica-
tions, that it would wrongly invoke
the 14th amendment, and that it
would distort even further the al-
ready topsy-turvy interpretation of
the commerce clause.

And perhaps most important, by
opening to federal regulation areas
of heretofore private activity, it
would undermine the fundamental
human right to own and control
private property.

(Space limits us to commenting on
only those two of the bill’s seven
titles which we consider crucial.)

Voting Rights

Title I—Voting Rights—lays down
federal standards for use of state
literacy tests, and further provides,
arbitrarily, that any person com-
pleting the sixth grade shall be

deemed to have “sufficient literacy,
comprehension and intelligence to
vote in any federal election.”

Our objection: from Article I of
the Constitution and the several
amendments relating to voting (12,
15, 17, 19), it is plain that the voter
qualifications are to be set by the
states, subject only to the restric-
tions of the amendments cited.

The Civil Rights bill in setting a
federal standard of voter qualifica-
tion, is therefore a clear violation
of the Constitution.

Public Accommodations

Title II—Public Accommodations—
Invoking the 14th amendment and
the commerce clause, this section
prohibits discriminatory practices
which “take on the character of
action by the States,” or which are
practiced by business a substantial
portion of whose goods have moved
in interstate commerce.

Our objection: first, the 14th
amendment provides “No _ state
shall....” The bill reasons that if
the state licenses or protects a busi-
ness through laws or ordinances,
then the business’s actions “take on
the character” of state action.

This reasoning, which makes a
state agency of every business from
hotdog stands to General Motors,
destroys the traditional distinction
between private property and pub-
lic agency. We categorically deny
that this was, or is, within the in-
tended ambit of the 14th amendment.

Four More Outstanding E.C. Representatives

 

JOHN M. MADISON, JR.

John Madison is a senior repre-
sentative from the undergraduate
school. His grade point ratio last
semester was 2.2. He is currently
the head dermitery counselor in the
freshman dorm, a tri-captain of the
varsity football team, a member of
the Steering Committee for the Mock
Convention, and secretary of Beta
Theta Pi Fraternity. John hopes to
take up law at Louisiana State Uni-
versity after graduation.

 

CHARLES B. ROWE

“Jim” Rowe is the senior Repre-
sentative from the law school. He
did his undergraduate work at Ran-
dolph-Macon College in Ashland,
Virginia. Jim is an associate editor
of the Law Review, a member of
the Steering Committee for the
Mock Convention, a member of Phi
Beta Kappa, Omicron Delta Kappa,
and he is a dormitory counselor.

Rowe has represented the law
school on the E.C. for two years.

Complsion to Buy?

Second, invoking the commerce
clause, the bill extends to nearly
every business the “compulsion to
sell,” rule heretofore limited to pub-
lic utilities. Why not, as logically, a
compulsion to buy?

For example, ten whites boycott
a store compelled by injunction to
serve a Negro; does not their action
have ten times the “substantial ef-
fect on interstate commerce” as the
serving of one Negro? (Such a re-
sult is easily possible in many
Southern cities.) Under the logic of
this bill, why not compel the ten
whites to resume trading at that
store?

Absurd? Yes, that’s what we think.

Right to Discriminate

We do not defend racial ciscrimi-
nation. We do urge, and strenously,
that the right to discriminate is the
sine qua non of individual liberty.

Our views on this point, which we
regard as the crucial one, are best
expressed in this recent comment
by a noted author and lecturer:

“The American system does not
rest upon some ‘right to be right,’
as some legislative majority may de-
fine what is ‘right.’ It rests solidly
upon the individual’s right to be
wrong—upon his right in his person-
onal life to be capricious, arbitrary,
prejudiced, biased, opinionated, un-
reasonable—upon his right to act as
a free man in a free society.”

JAMES E. KULP

Jim Kulp is the intermediate law
school representative to the Execu-
tive Committee. His undergraduate
work was completed at Hampden-
Sydney College. At Hampden-
Sydney Jim was a member of Chi

Omicron Delta Kappa.

Last Spring Kulp was the Univer-
sity Party candidate for vice-presi-
dent of the student body. He was
defeated by a narrow margin.

Tuesday, November 12

I have been amused by the recent
conversations I have heard about sex
around the campus. Now that Gal-
braith has cleared the air for us, the
moral fervor of our guardians takes
on a rather pathetic quality—but no
less pathetic is the fervent theorizing
of my freshman friends when their
actual experience is brought to
light. Most of the people I know are
too reflective to make good Don
Juans, and talk about sex too much
to know anything about it.

Wednesday, November 13

This winter has been so mild that
it seems to have thrown the
student body into a fit of anxiety.
Usually the switch from summer
clothing to Harris Tweed is a clear-
cut thing, a matter of a weekend
sufficing to effect a complete change-
over. But with the weather we have
been having, no one knows where he
stands. Now it is cold, and out come
the topcoats; the next day will see
a flush of madras. If you misjudge
the weather in the morning, noon
will be sure to bring your complete
humiliation as you in your parka
pass a cordon of sun bathers. The
times are troubled, and there has
been a sudden run on _ guidance
counselors.

Friday, November 15

After an appropriate build-up in
the press, Negro author Ralph El-
lison visited our campus and gave
his lecture: “The Novel and the
American Experience.” It was very
disappointing.

Perhaps those who came were ex-
pecting a more exciting fare—but
Ellison’s talk, which rambled on for
almost an hour and a half, said little
more than one could cull out of the
pages of a College Outline Series n
American literature.

Saturday, November 16

Today we had the last of the foot-
ball weekends. Overheard at a fra-
ternity house: a social chairman ex-
horting the freshmen to “put on a
good show. At least look like you’re
having a good time. It looks bad
when people’ aren’t partying
enough.” If a house is having trouble
with its parties, maybe it could hire
professionals, mercenaries as it were,
to liven things up, and then every-
one else could sit back and not have
to worry about it. I have nothing
against combos, but this combined
effort to produce forced fun leaves
me cold.

Sackett Scores Sixteen Points
As W&L Whips Lynx, 36-12

By JIM CROTHERS

Tuesday Sports Editor
Not only did W&L halfback Henry Sackett win the Ty
Rauber Homecoming Award at halftime for his outstanding
play against Centre several weeks ago, the Lynchburg senior
also led the Generals to a 36-12 swamping of Southwestern

Saturday in a CAC contest.

Sackett carred 15 times for 117
yards (that’s 7.8 yards per carry) in
his final W&L home game, scoring
16 points to increase his seasonal

        

d

Yoffe Sackett
total to 46 points. Fourtcen of these
tallies came in the second quarter
when the Generals scored all but
8 of their points.

Washington and Lee recovered a
first period Lynx fumble and Stuart
Yoffe began the scoring with a 28-
yard gallop to paydirt;Sackett add-
ing the two extra points. South-
western came right back however,
with Bert Chafin tossing to end Ray
Baker for the visitor’s first six-
pointer and Chafin’s try for the two
pointer failed, giving W&L an 8-6
first period lead.

Fullback Sid Butler led the
Washington and Lee second quarter
onslaught with an eight-yard plunge
for the Generals’ second tally. Soon
afterwards, Sackett, too, found run-
ning room up-the-middle and gal-
loped 60 yards for the touchdown
making the score 20-6.

A 47-yard pass from Quarterback
John McDaniel to Tri-Captain end
Buck Ogilvie set up the fourth W&L
TD, and Sackett skirted end for
the final two yards. Butler then
made the score 28-6 with a success-
ful two-pointer. The red team was
not to be outdone, however, and
came back to score just as the half
ended on a 15-yard aerial from A.
J. Barranco to halfback Bill David.
This same passing combination,
which accounted for three of the
four General completions, worked
on the two-point conversion attempt
to give the Minks a 36-6 half-time
margin .

The same Chafin-to-Baker com-
bination accounted for Southwest-
ern’s final points and the lone
second-half score. This win brings
the Generals’ season mark to 5-3, as-
suring them of their fourth straight
winning campaign, with the final
game to be played against Wash-
ington University of St. Louis.

The “Battling Bears” met with
their first defeat last week at Se-
wanee, 14-13, but up until that
time were ranked as the 11th best
small college football team in the
U.S. By virtue of Sewanee’s victory
last Saturday, they won the CAC
title and next Saturday’s W&L vs.
Washington U. contest will be a bat-
tle for the runner-up position.

struck in an unexpected place as| #

the Washington and Lee soccer team
finished a disappointing fourth in
the Virginia State Tournament at

the University of Virginia Friday and | *

Saturday.

After an opening game victory
over VPI, 4-0, the Generals dropped
a tough one to Lynchburg by the
same score as their regular season
defeat, 1-0. In the battle for third
and fourth they were upset by Roa-
noke, 2-0; Roanoke had succumbed
to the Generals, 4-1, seven days be-
fore.

Virginia went on to defeat Lynch-
burg in the finals and retain their
championship. The game was tied 1-1
at the end of regulation play, and
neither team was able to score in
two five-minute overtimes. Virginia
was given the victory by virtue of
having had more corner kicks dur-
ing the overtime period. VPI whip-
ped Randolph-Macon for fifth place.

The Generals coasted to victory
in the opener with Preben Berthel-
sen and goalie Tom Green leading
the way. Bethelsen scored two goals
and assisted on another, while Green
blanked the Gobblers. The Tech-
men almost averted the shutout on
a penalty kick, but Green made a
great save to protect his whitewash
job. Jim Mell and Steve Hibbard
accounted for the other two goals,
while Hibbard and Tim Henry pick-
ed up assists.

Lynchburg was lucky to get away
with a victory against W&L. The
winners’ one goal was knocked in
by a W&L player when his head shot
of a corner kick went astray and
got by General goalie Green. It
was one of many tough breaks to go
against them during the tournament.

The Roanoke defeat was probably

Light Brigade
Hands Defeat

Lo Hargrave

By MARC WINSTON
Tuesday Sports Writer

Friday afternoon the Light Brigade
came through with a big win over
Hargrave Military Academy which
gave them the first winning record in
several years of W&L freshman
football. The score was a convincing
22-6 for the Baby Generals who won
their last four straight games after
dropping their initial two contests.

W&L opened the scoring in the
first period. After recovering a
fumble on the Hargrave thirty yard
line, John Bogart burst through the
line and went the rest of the way
for the score. Rob Reading converted
to make it 7-0. W&L got its second
score of the afternoon when Phil
Claxton took a punt on his own
forty yard line and sprinted all the
way for six. Again Reading success-
fully converted and the Baby Gen-
erals left the field at half-time with
a 14-0 lead.

Hargrave came back for a score in
the third period. The touchdown
came when Riddle gathered in a pass
and eluded several members of the
W&L secondary on a play that
covered twenty yards. The conver-
sion attempt failed. The Baby Gen-
erals sewed up the victory in the
fourth period when Bryant Ken-
drick threw twenty yards to Hank
Hendrickson for the third W&L
score. Bogart ran the extra point
to make the final total 22-6.

(Head Paces X-Country Win;
Kilpatrick, O’ Connor Picked

Not only did Charlie Head set a new Washington and Lee
cross-country course record of 24:10 minutes in Saturday’s
overwhelming 18-45 victory over Fairmont College (W. Va.),
but that win gave the General harriers a 6-1 season record, the
best in the history of W&L cross-country.

The swift senior runner bested the old record, set by Mike
* Shank, by a full ten seconds, and

was followed closely in this last
meet by season standouts Riff
O’Connor, Andy Kilpatrick, and Bill
Wildrick. Because of their consis-

tancy and hard work, Kilpatrick, a
a junior, and O’Connor, a sophomore,
were elected last night as next
year’s cross-country captains.

This season’s 6-1 mark bettered the
6-2 mark gained in both ’61 and ’62,
and gives Washington and Lee an
overall record since 1921 in fall
running of 80-86-2.

Harrier Coach Dick Miller noted
that the lack of one exceptionally
fast man hurt the Generals in the
state meet. But he also felt that the
strength of the team in dual meets
stemmed largely from the depth
and closeness of the times.

Prospects for next season look
bright with only Head graduating
and several good freshmen, Bob
Brown, John and Clint Morse, and
Dick Robinson returning to take
up the slack. Other harriers return-
ing include: Robin Dyer, Clyde
Foshee, Gene Hatfield, Lee Johnson,
Scott Kennedy, Bob Patton, Chuck
Walker, and Ed Wood.

Ellison Talks Of Continuing ‘Civil War’

(Continued from page 1)
not solve, Ellison continued, and so
after the North had won, it turned
away from any forthright concern
with what the war had been about.
It was, therefore, a moral defeat.
This is pointed out in Stephen
Crane’s Red Badge of Courage, in
which there is not a single reference
to the issues over which the war was
fought. The whole story, as Ellison
pointed out, is about an individual
and his search to find himself and
stay alive in a struggle he had not
made and did not understand.
Crane’s novel showed, better than
anything else, “the civil war Amer-
ica had become after the Civil War.”

The Modern Writers

From this point, Ellison went on
to talk about the development of
American rhetoric, especially where
the lost generation after World War
I was concerned. Hemingway was
mentioned only insofar as he stayed
away from the central conflict be-
tween the northern and southern
states. Faulkner, on the other hand,
decided he could not forget what
the war had been about. “The South

had never forgotten the war, the
North had never remembered it—but
Faulkner remembered it, a1.d knew
how to deal with it.”

The remainder of Ellison’s lecture
was devoted to praise for Faulkner.
He put the novel back on the track
it had left after the Civil War. Be-
cause of Faulkner’s influence, the
novel struck once again at reality,
it hit through the stereotype to the
reality of human life.

 

Ending with a challenge, Ellison
said that the American novelist must
have the courage to “tell the truth,
whatever the truth might be, pas-
sionately and eloquently.” The nov-
elist must present the complexities
of human life in their most human
form. Faulkner wrestled with time,
memory, and human passion, and
made form and art out of these
things. At least, said Ellison, we had
him.

 

Soccermen Place
(Continued from page 3)

caused by a letdown more than any-
thing else. The Generals were so
disappointed by their fluke defeat at
the hands of Lynchburg that they
couldn’t get up much enthusiasm for
the game. It was rather a lackluster
affair. To add to this problem, the
Generals also had a long list of in-
juries from the preceding games.

Coach Joe Lyles had laudatory

remarks about his defense. He com-
mented on the fine play of his full-
backs, Redmond, Pete Preston, and
Howard Busse. He also applauded
the play of Green, which was hardly
unusual. Hibbard and Wes Horner
also received the coach’s compli-
ments.
For the season the Generals fin-
ished with a 7 and 5 record. They
outscored their opponents, 31-17, but
were unable to win many of the
close ones. Berthelsen finished as
the team scoring leader by a wide
margin. He tallied 11 goals and five
assists for 16 points. The nearest man
to him was Henry with nine points.
Lyles next year will be to find a
replacement for Green. Lyles can-
not expect to come up with a goalie
of Green’s calibre, but he may have
trouble finding even a suitable sub-
stitute. Sophomore Bob Larus is the
heir apparent to the job, but he is
of unknown quality because of his
lack of varsity game competition.

Other members who will be leav-
ing the club are Mell and Berthelsen,
two of the main cogs in the attact.
The loss of these two is particularly
upsetting to Lyles because he had a
shortage of wings to begin this sea-

son. There is also some question as
to the eligibility of Chris Clarke for
next season. Clarke will be a second
semester senior then and may not be
allowed to play. Although Lyles
would like to have Clark back, he
does have Charlie Sweet in reserve.
Still, the big task will be replacing
Green.

The Executive Committee of the
Student Body did something two
weeks ago which struck me as a
very good idea: they published for
the benefit of the students a mimeo-
graphed sheet containing the pro-
cedure which is followed in the in-
vestigation and trial of an honor vio-
lation. These sheets are available in
the Student Union on the first
floor—sitting on a table on the left
side of the UCA room. They have
not been paid the attention which
they deserve.

PRESIDENT ASSASSINATED IN DALLAS

 

Faculty Opinion Divided
On Assimilation Committee

By SYD LEWIS

Will Washington and Lee’s con- |

ventional dress be able to stand the)

powerful forces toward change in|

the 1960’s? Since World War II

dress at Washington and Lee has |
become increasingly lax.

Not too many years ago it was
considered improper to be seen |
without a vest; however, starting |
after the war with the innovation
of khaki’s and continuing into the
sixties with the levi fad, conven-
tional dress has deteriorated sub-
stantially. The lack of enthusiasm
for the enforcement of this old tra-
dition was demonstrated in the Tues-
day Ring-tum Phi in a letter signed
by members of the EC and assimila-
tion committee asking for the abol-
ishment of the assimilation commit-
tee—the one organization on campus
devoted to re-enforcing conventional
dress.

In an interview of ten  pro-
fessors, 50 per cent favored the
abolition of the Assimilation Com-
mittee. Seventy per cent thought
that dress would become more casual
than it already is and 90 per cent felt
that the alumni would be against the
proposal.

Many of those professors who
favored the abolishment of the as-
similation committee thought that
students would not take advantage
of the added freedom to any great
degree and that conventional dress
would really become the tradition
that it is heralded to be while
others felt that tradition was out-
dated and ought to be forgotten if
students did not support it.

It was mentioned that Washington
and Lee’s prestige is not due at all
to the manner of dress and other
Eastern universities probably had no
idea that the tradition was still in
existence at W&L.

Those who were not in favor of
the abandonment of the committee
had derogatory comments about the
letter in the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
and about the committee members.
One professor remarked that the As-
similation Committee was enforcing
a tradition of sorts not a rule, for
an analogy can be made beteen con-
ventional dress and the honor sys-
tem. Both need enforcing commit-
tees although they both should be
considered a tradition.

Furthermore, faculty members
felt that anyone who was against
the committee certainly had no
business on the Assimilation Com-
mittee and should resign imme-
diately if he signed the recent let-
ter. Also, there was some doubt
about certain signers of the letter
who said in the letter their only
motive in abolishing the Assimila-
tion Committee was to stop arbi-
trary enforcement while what they
really wanted was to abolish con-
ventional dress altogether.

 

In brief, there is a growing dis-

satisfaction about how conventional
dress is enforced. There are also
students who would like to do away
with coat and tie attire altogether;
however, there still remain many
students and certainly a large ma-

| jority of alumni who would not like

| to, in any way, make dress stand-
ards any less formal than they are
now.

Even those who are in favor of
conventional dress and want it con-
tinued as a tradition agree that
there are basic defficiencies in the
Assimilation Committee. What is the
solution? Probably this question has
no answer; however, it seems that
total abolishment of the Assimila-
tion Committee might be a bad rish
to take at this time.

Noted Critic
Hugh Kenner
Speaks Dec. 5

By RANDY FINGLAND

Hugh Kenner, a noted critic of
modern literature, will speak in du-
Pont Auditorium on December 5,
at 8:15. His talk will be sponsored
by the Seminars in Literature Com-
mittee.

Mr. Kenner, born in Peterborough,
Ontario, on January 7, 1923, attended
the University of Tronto where he
was a gold medalist in English in
1945. After obtaining his M.A. in
1946, he taught for two years at
Assumption College, Windsor, On-
tario. He worked on his Ph.D. at

The world was alarmed today by the sudden assasination of
President Kennedy at 1:25 in Dallas. Taken to the hospital in
critical condition, the Chief Executive died at 2:00 EST.

Vice-President Johnson, who was three cars behind Ken-
nedy in the motor parade, has been sworn into office as Ken-
nedy’s successor. John McCormick, president pro tempore of
the Senate, would have become president had Johnson been

killed also.

Police in Dallas have seized both 24-year-old Lee H. Os-
wald and a 30-year-old unidentified man as suspects.

 

Boorman To Talk
On Red Bloc Split

Tonight at 8 o'clock Howard L.
Boorman, a research specialist at
Columbia University, will speak in
duPont Auditorium. The subject of
his lecture will be “The Sino-Soviet
Conflict: A Retrospective Survey.”
The lecture is being sponsored by
the W&L department of history in
cooperation with the University cen-
ter in Virginia.

Tonight’s talk is the last in a series
of lectures in Virginia schools un-
der the University Center program.
He has spoken this week at Ran-
dolph-Macon, Mary Baldwin, the
University of Virginia and Mary
Washington.

Boorman is director of Columbia’s
Research Project on Men and Poli-
tics in Modern China. Educated at
the University of Wisconsin and
Yale, Boorman was an officer of the
United States Foreign Service from
1947 to 1955. He was serving at
Peking when the Chinese Commun-
ist entered that city in 1949, and
later spent four years on the staff
of the American Consulate General
in Hong Kong.

In 1945-55 he was awarded a
Rockefeller Public Service Award.

Is The W&L Fraternity System

By Warren Montgomery

When one reads or hears
something about fraternities,
it is almost always disparaging.
In almost any controversial is-

sue, the fraternal point of
view is seldom discussed while
the anti-fraternity aspects of the
issues are usually considered in de-
tail. As a result,
the public image
of the national

tional control, scholarship, feeding
and housing facilities, and _ social
snobbery.

 

Discrimination vs. Rights

The subject of racial and relig-
ious discrimination is particularly
loaded; within the last five years,
numerous institution-chapter and
national-chapter splits have occurred
over it. No fraternity will go so
far as to state that discrimination
on the basis of presumed White-
Protestant superiority is that or-
ganization’ss membership policy.
Nevertheless, most fraternal groups
maintain, with reason, that as pri-
vate social organizations, they have
an inherent right to elect to mem-
bership those whom they please, no
matter what the reason. No univer-
sity has the right to legislate on
whom its students will like and
take as friends.

Rallies

Pledging activities, especially those
involving unconstructive “hell-rais-
ing,’ are also under severe criti-
cism. Viewed impersonally, this sort
of activity is unjustifiable because
of the loss of study time and sleep
to the pledge. To many fraternity
men, though, their respective or-

 

ganizations mean a great deal more
to them than just an eating club.

Because they greatly value their
membership, they do not want to
confer it on anyone lightly. A

time and sleep to become a mem-

al staffs are hidebound, national or-
ganizations are basically democratic,
and national action usually reflects
undergraduate will. Then too, a fra-
ternity must have a coherent nation-
al bond if it is to preserve the uni-
formity in ideals and ritual which
make it a fraternal rather than so-
cial organization.
Fraternities vs. Grades

The time-honored precept that
fraternity men are poor scholars can
no longer be accepted. On many
campuses, as on ours, the all-frater-
nity average is above the all-men’s
average, indicating that fraternity
men make better grades than inde-
pendents. In a survey of the eigh-
teen fraternities at W&L, it was
found that sixteen of the national
organizations have scholarship pro-
grams of some sort. These programs,
along with academic requirements
for initiation and individual chapter
scholarship programs, do much to
keep fraternity academic ratings
high.

Clark Named
Top Debater

Jay Clark, captain of the W&L
debate team was chosen best speak-
er in the Delta Sigma Rho-Tau
Kappa Alpha District 3 debate tour-
nament held last week-end at Wil-
liam and Mary in Williamsburg. He
was named first out of fifty-six de-
baters, representing ten Virginia and
District of Columbia colleges and
universities.

Clark also won first place as the
best affirmative team in the tourna-
ment debating with Jack Eure of
Suffolk, Virginia. They won first
place by winning three out of four
debates on the national debate ques-
tion. Eure tied for second place in
the speaker ratings, finishing one
point behind Clark.

Senior Debaters

Both Clark and Eure are senior
debaters. As a freshman debater
in 1960-61, Clark won more debate
awards than anyone else at W&lL.
He was a member of the State
Championship Debate Team both in
1960 and 1961.

On the negative side of the tour-
nament, Tabor Novak and Roy Pow-
ell, also won three out of four de-
bates, but finished behind a nega-
tive team from George Washington
that had a perfect record of four
out of four.

Steve Smith, one of four other de-
baters from W&L participating in
the tournament, was elected secre-
tary of the mid-Atlantic debating
organization. He is one of three Tau
Kappa Alpha-Delta Sigma Rho of-
ficers in region 3,

Kennedy slumped face-down into

not hurt, jumped up, grabbed him,
and tried to hold up his head. Mrs.

the chest and the head. The Pres-
ident died at 2 p.m. Eastern Stand-

Police immediately spread a drag-
net around Dallas in search for the
assassin. At least one suspect was
reported to have been apprehended.

First Report of Death

First word of the President’s
death came from the two priests
who had been summoned to give
the last rites. Acting White House
News Secretary Malcolm Kilduff
released official confirmation and
stated that Kennedy had died of a
gunshot wound in the brain.

Vice president Johnson was rid-
ing three cars behind the President.
Reports that he was also wounded
were denied and soon after the
President’s death Johnson left the
hospital.

After the shooting pandemonium
broke loose at the scene. Secret
Service agents waved the motorcade
to the nearby Parkland Hospital but
it took five minutes to reach the
emergency entrance.

Several witnesses have said that
Kennedy was fired on from an up-

ginia polities.” This discussion will
be held in Room 8 of Newcomb Hall,
and all interested students are in-
vited to attend.

Mr. McDowell is a nationally syn-
dicated columnist, particularly well-
known for his work on the Rich-
mond Times-Dispatch. His column
deals primarily with politics from a
humorous point of view. In 1960, Mr.

 

McDowell received the National
Headliners’ Award for the most hu-
morous column.

Besides his newspaper work, Mr.
McDowell has had two collections
of his columns published in book
form. The first was One Thing After
Another, published in 1960, and the
second, What Did You Have in
Mind?, published in 1963.

Mr. McDowell’s father is a Profes-
sor of Law at W&L, and Mr. Mc-
Dowell himself is a W&L graduate.
He attended W&L immediately fol-
lowing the close of World War II,
and his freshman year, began writ-
ing for The Columns, the Wé&l.
newspaper at that time. His soph-
omore year, he became editor of
this publication. When the Ring-
tum Phi came back into existence
his junior year, he wrote a column
on this publication also. This same
year, he worked on the Calyx staff,
was an executive Committee mem-
ber, and wrote for the Southern
Collegian. Mr. McDowell, in his sen-
ior year was elected president of
the Publications Board. He was also
a member of the Washington Liter-
ary Society, and of the Editorial
Board.

Mr. McDowell’s talk is being
jointly sponsored by Colonel Gil-
liam of VMI, and Dr. Colvin of
W&L, through the auspices of the
NCEP, the National Committee for
Edueation in Politics. This is a non-

THE RING-TUM PHI

Being Realistic

Should we get rid of the Assimilation Committee? Last
Tuesday a letter signed by several students and published in
the Ring-tum Phi indicated that this is what we should do to
strengthen conventional dress. Perhaps the authors of the
letter were merely trying to shock us, perhaps they were per-
fectly sincere. At any rate, the campus opinion overall seems
to be that to abolish the Assimilation Committee would be to
abolish conventional dress.

Why, we inquired of a number of students, would the
abolition of the Committee be that drastic a step? The general
reply: we are too lazy (too “human”) to put on a coat and
tie every day without having some authority that says we have
to. As one student commented, ‘Once a few students begin to
get away with wearing whatever they want to, without being
penalized, then everyone is going to say ‘What the heck’ and
start breaking down.”

This sort of feeling does not mean we don’t want the
tradition. Students on the whole like the idea of conventional
dress, but they lack the necessary self-discipline to observe it
faithfully under their own steam. It’s a very realistic approach:
we as individuals are not always able to “generate’”’ our own mo-
tivation to do what we know we ought to. There is constantly
the need for some outside force or pressure to keep us going.
This principle holds true not just for the Assimilation Commit-
tee, but for grades, limited cuts, the E.C. judiciary, etc. Ideally
there should be no need for any of these. In reality, if we get
rid of them, we get rid of what they have been instituted to

enforce.

Reader Questions Cockshutt
On College Independence

Dear Sir,

The column by Mr. Rod Cockshutt
in the Friday, November 15, edition
has raised some interesting ques-
tions.

Mr. Cockshutt asserted that an
independent university was primar-
ily distinguished by its “freedom,”
which he defines, as “the freedom of
professors to teach their subjects as
they choose to; the freedom of stu-
dents to follow the truth wherever
and however it might lead them; the
freedom of the university as a whole
to move boldly, to experiment, to
play with new ideas—...”

He then concluded that for var-
ious reasons—which apparently
condense to the Board of Trustees’
failure to do what Mr. Cockshutt
thought they ought to do—Wash-
ington and Lee was not truly inde-
pendent, being governed instead
by “a self-perpetuating oligarchy.”

But obviously a university cannot
function in a vacuum — someone
must bear the ultimate responsibility
for the decisions: what courses will
be taught, who will teach them, who
will be fired for not teaching them
properly, to whom will the univer-
sity make available its facilities,
etc. If not the Board of Trustees,
whom?

Mr. Cockshutt is concerned that
“everything that matters here then
is really at the mercy of their (Board
of Trustees) economic, social and po-
litical views.” At the mercy of whose
views should it be? A faculty com-
mittee? The University President?
A club of fifteen twenty-year-old
students? Or Mr. Cockshutt?

Mr. Cockshutt seems to be of the
opinion that a university is to al-
low its facilities to be used by
anyone and everyone to whom
some group of students extends an
invitation? Maybe the Board was
wrong in its refusal to allow Mar-
tin Luther King to speak, but
does it follow that it should allow
anyone to speak? Assuming that
our society, and thus our educa-
tional institutions, advance with
time and learn from the lessons
of history, shouldn’t our educa-

 

tion—in and out of the classroom—
be guided by this experience?

Surely Washington and Lee would
not hire an English professor who
refused to include William Shakes-
peare in an English course. But
would it compel him to include some
lesser light? And why should a uni-
versity open its doors to any con-
temporary figure because of the
fancy of some curious students?
Need our facilities be made available
to one—such as George Lincoln
Rockwell—who obviously has noth-
ing to offer to serious study?

It seems too obvious for contra~-
diction that in the pursuit of know-
ledge a student has to be guided to
some degree, by the “economic, so-
cial, and political views” of some-
body.

What seems to bother Mr. Cock-
shutt is not the fact that the Board
of Trustees decides, but what it de-
cides. One gets the impression that
Mr. Cockshutt would be gloriously
happy if the Board of Trustees, in
a flurry of enlightenment, allowed
Martin Luther King, George Lincoln
Rockwell, and Gus Hall to speak at
the University to an integrated au-
dience of Washington and Lee stu-
dents.

Maybe they should. But the de-
cision is not to be mine or Mr.
Cockshutt’s, but rather is reserved
to those possessed of superior wis-
dom and experience. If not the
Board of Trustees, then certainly
the Board of Somebody.

A university which is “free” and
“independent” of State or religious
control must still operate within a
framework that is fashioned in some
manner short of student anarchy—
the results of which can be observed
in the chaotic conditions at the Uni-
versity of Caracas in Venezuela or
at the Sorbonne in Paris. Though we
may quarrel with the policy, and
even with those designated to de-
termine it, we should not be so ir-
rational as to argue that there should
be none.

GOP Nomination Is Within Reach
Of Swelling Goldwater Supporters

Editor’s Note: This article is
the first of a series on Republican
presidential _ possibilities. | Next
spring Washington and Lee will
nominate its own Republican can-
didate for the White House, the
W&L Mock Convention preceding
that of the professionals in San
Francisco by several months.

By STEVE SMITH
Managing Editor

Although Gov. Rockefeller has now
jumped off to a commanding lead
in speech-making and hand-shaking,
Sen. Barry Goldwater maintains
what may be an unbeatable lead in
pledged votes for the Republican
presidential nomination.

Leaders of the drive to draft Sen.
Goldwater for the nomination now
claim 500 of the 655 votes needed
to nominate at the convention. Still
Goldwater, the only candidate be-
ing actively supported by a W&L
student organization, refuses to de-
clare his candidacy.

Perhaps he’s waiting until the Na-
tional Draft Goldwater Committee
can promise him all 655 votes he
needs. Indications from all over the
country are that even this is not
out of the question.

 

 

A 13-State Rally

A meeting two weeks ago of
Southern GOP leaders was convinc-
ing proof of the Goldwater claim to
a “solid South” at the party’s con-
vention. Supposedly a Republican
leadership conference, the meeting
in Charleston, South Carolina, was
actually a 13-state Goldwater rally.
These 13 states— the 11 deep South
states plus Kentucky and West Vir-
ginia—have 317 of the 655 votes
Goldwater will need to be nominat-
ed. The unquestionable loyalty of the
South is the starting point for the
Goldwater boom.

Mr. Conservative can also, ap-
parently, count on nearly all the
Southwestern votes at the con-
vention. From the one big south-
western state, Texas, Sen. John
Tower is attempting to lead a rush
to Goldwater (just as Goldwater
helped Tower to be elected Sena-
tor). Texas Republican Chairman
Peter O’Donnell heads the Nation-
al Draft Goldwater movement. If
the Southwest can be pulled in,
and this is probable, then the
nomination could be clinched by
votes from the Midwest GOP,
the ancient stronghold of another

 

Mr. Conservative, Robert Taft.

Even though Goldwater conserva-
tism is a little extreme for many
midwest conservatives, he stands to
draw their votes because of their
fear of the very liberal Gov. Rocke-
feller. Still, Goldwater is on shaky
ground in such states as Ohio and
Michigan, where his espousal of
right-to-work laws promises to unite
the all-powerful labor unions against
him. Goldwater has also alienated
many midwestern farmers by his
opposition to the continuation of
farm subsidies.

Only a Bandwagon?

Obviously Goldwater will enter
the convention next July with an
excellent chance of receiving the
requisite number of votes. Is the
strength he now shows deep-rooted,
or is it a mere bandwagon display
being put on by a few enthusiasts?
In the South, and probably in the
Southwest, Goldwater’s strength is
unshakable. But unlooked-for set-
backs or the availability of a com-
promise candidate such as Nixon
might cost Goldwater most of his
more moderate support.

In the event of a convention dead-
lock with Rockefeller, Goldwater

Part Four: The Fraternity System

 

Fraternities’ Viewpoint Expressed

(Continued from page 1)

University Meddling
Many institutions are dissatisfied
with fraternity housing and feeding
facilities, and some resort to such
devices as housing fraternities in
dormitory sections and requiring
payment by students for institution-
al food provided by the university
or by a contracted catering corpor-
ation. In doing so, a university ig-
nores two facts: its business is the
education of young men—not the
regulation of their daily lives; and
most students would prefer to eat
and live at the fraternity house,
where they can have more and better
food and live away from the direct

influence of the university.

Fraternities are accused of social
snobbery on the grounds that they
exclude some students who would
like to belong. This situation is one
of the most regrettable things about
the fraternity system, but there is
no way to change it without de-
stroying the fraternity as a group
of congenial people voluntarily as-
sociated with one another. Most
fraternity members feel that the
idea of a fraternity as a group of
friends instead of an impersonal or-
ganization is more important than
trying to include everyone. Open
parties and social membership are
well meaning attempts of the fra-
ternities to improve this situation.

Rushing

Two more criticisms that are level-
ed at fraternities are that they play
a “disproportionate role in under-
graduate life” and that they do not
give an incoming freshman enough
time to consider pledging before
starting rush week. For these two
things, fraternities can only offer
practical (but not idealistic) ex-
cuses. They play such a large role
in undergraduate life because they
want power and respectability, both
of which may be obtained by grasp-
ing control of campus organizations.
A desire to remain financially solv-
ent prompts the immediate rushing
system used here and elsewhere.

 

So far, this article has simply
tried to give the fraternity answer
to various aspects of the attack
against the system. There are, how-
ever, several very commendable
qualities of fraternities that are in-
dependent of the criticisms. In the
first place, fraternities provide a
valuable form of social life. Universi-
ties are unable to supply anything
more than mass social events. They
cannot, for instance, provide small,
more intimate parties as can frater-
nities, and they cannot or will not
provide them in the same quantities.
Nor are they able to provide trans-
portation and arranging of dates. The
fraternities can fulfill the social
needs of the students much more
adequately than the university could
ever hope to.

Character Development

Fraternities are a great character-
building influence too. In the words
of Julia Mott Hodge from an edi-
torial appearing in the Alpha Phi
Quarterly of 1897: “...in spite of
the inspiration university life affords
to broad thinking, there is often a
temptation to narrow living...
Absorbed in books, burdened, prob-
ably, with an excess of work, it is
easy for the conscientious student
to shut himself out from the hearts
and lives of his fellows, to live self-
ishly, and thus, in his own life, to
defeat the very end for which he
is studying so zealously.

“Fraternity life is useful in ob-
viating this danger. The constant
intercourse between the different
members, the possession of com-
mon interests, and the working
toward a common end, the mutual
demands for sympathy and aid, the
daily friction caused by clashing
interests and difference of dispo-
sition, the constant necessity of
continual forbearance and love, the
‘bearing one another’s burdens’
and the sharing of one another’s
joys, the giving up of individual
desires for the sake of others and
the society in general—all these
form but few of the many ways in

 

 

which fraternity life
deepens, enriches.”

broadens,

Finally, there is the matter of
brotherhood. Despite the pattern of
today’s social behavior which does
not admit sentiment and affection,
the normal freshman is left with a
great gap caused by the removal of
his family and friends. A fraternity,
through its associations which are
stronger than casual friendship, gives
the student a home, a sense of be-
longing, and the assurance that his
life is a matter of interest to others,
his fraternity brothers.

 

would be hard pressed to hold his
midwestern votes against Nixon or
a similarly moderate candidate, who
could attract support from indus-
trial elements but who could also
be supported by the conservatives.

Far West Doubtful

Goldwater support from other re-
gions is even more doubtful. In
California former Sen. William
Knowland is beating the conservative
drums and a powerful Rightest ele-
ment looks upon Goldwater as the
candidate who comes closest to its
views; but Goldwater will have to
concede millions of industrial and
urban votes in California and the
state GOP knows it. Knowland will
not be able to control the huge Cal-
ifornia delegation all the way.

In Oregon, popular liberal Gov.
Mark Hatfield can be expected to
cast a heavy weight against Gold-
water.

In the East there is scattered
Goldwater backing, but much of it
will succumb to the Rockefeller
wave which is only now starting to
roll after the turmoil over his di-
vorce and re-marriage. Goldwater
could, though, cramp Rocky’s style
painfully if he holds his present
lead in New Hampshire long enough
to win the opening round primary
in that state. New Hampshire Sen.
Morris Cotton is fighting a delaying
action against the vigorous Rocke-
feller backers until Goldwater gets
around to formally opening his own
campaign.

The sheer impetus of the Gold-
water drive will make it hard to
stop, but there is also the danger
that the conservative forces have
started too early and that their ef-
fort may “peak” long before the
convention. This possibility may be
what keeps Goldwater from an-
nouncing himself as a candidate.

A Magnetic Personality

Once the Arizonan does enter the
campaign, the strength of his per-
sonality could be all the extra push
needed by the conservative forces
already active. He has pre-empted
the image of the Old Frontiersman—
and remember that a coonskin cap
almost nominated Estes Kefauver in
1952.

It’s almost impossible not to like
Barry personally. He is magnetic
before a crowd. He has an elec-
tronic flagpole that raises the
American flag every day at sun-
rise. He is a Major General in
the U.S. Air Force Reserves.

In addition to the intangible as-
sets of personality, the Goldwater
steamroller is crammed with money
from conservatives who haven’t
really had anybody to give it to
in the last few campaigns. His or-
ganization is permanently entrench-
ed in the South and Southwest and
is moving into other areas in force.
The press has recently given him
more than enough publicity, al-
though it hasn’t all been favorable
by any means.

Nobody could be much surprised
if Goldwater sweeps into the July
convention, overcomes Rockefeller’s
liberal wing of the GOP, and Nixon
and Eisenhower’s me-too wing of
the party, and emerges as the next
opponent of the fearsome Kennedy
machine.

Views On

By BOB POTTS

Friday Columnist
In Birmingham, Alabama city
codes prohibit any restaurant to
serve whites and negroes in the
same room unless
they are separated
by a partition of
at least seven feet.
Durham, North
Carolina specifies
that such a wall
shall be “con-
structed of wood,

plaster, or brick

or like material,

and shall reach

Potts from floor to the
ceiling.

This concept of equ-wall but

separate has recently been defend-
ed by Thomas Jefferson Hoggs, the
noted antiquarian who finds two
main sanctions in American social
codes to support his case.

First, Hoggs recalls the passage
in Robert Frost’s “Mending Wall,”
Good fences make good neighbors
T. J. Hoggs dismissed the next lines,
Why do they make good neighbors?

Isn’t it
Where there are cows?

 

Defends
Constitution

Is irrelevant because there are no
cows, only Negroes. A salient point,
however, is that the North Carolina
law only specifies plaster or brick
with no mention of New England
field stone.

“Raise Clause”

From this, he moves to his second
supporting point, the Federal Con-
stitution. In Article I, section 8, the
“raise clause” appears. By this the
Federal Government is delegated
the power to raise armies, leaving,
obviously, the power to raise other
things, such as walls, to reside with-
in the states and their cities.

Also, Article IV, section 2 de-
clares, “The Citizens of each State
shall be entitled to all Privileges
and Immunities of Citizens in the
several States.” Hoggs interprets
this to mean that citizens are guar-
anteed immunity by law. He cites as
precedent the many state laws en-
forcing small pox innoculations and
extrapolites that walls provide im-
munization, thus are constitutional.

In summary, T. J. Hoggs finds the
Omnibus Civil Rights Bill, and es-
pecially the Public Accommodations
clause “a damnable piece of free-
masonery, Sir,!”

Generals To Meet Washington U. In Final

By LES GRANDIS

Tomorrow the Generals travel to
St. Louis to meet Washington Uni-
versity in W&L’s last game of the
season. On paper it seems that the
Generals will need somewhat more
than simply improved morale due to
an easy 36-12 victory over South-
western last week, to overcome the
Battlin‘ Bears of Coach Dave Pud-
dington.

Washington has just about every-
thing that allows a football coach
to sleep soundly the night before
a game. They are one of the biggest
teams the Generals play this year,
with the line averaging well over

 

200 pounds. Outstanding linemen

include tackle Rich Charlton (240
lbs.) and center Mike Thompson,
who goes both ways for the Bears.

Coach Puddington uses the three
platoon system similar to that of
W&L Coach Lee McLaughlin. The
Bears were undefeated until they
lost to Illinois and Sewanee the
past two weekends. Before the Se-
wanee game they were rated
eleventh in the nation among small
college teams.

Washington uses a strong “I” of-
fense, similar to that of Southern
Cal, based around quarterback
Claude Frazier, who doesn’t throw
often, but has completed 75 per
cent. In the Sewanee game he com-

 

pleted 9 out of ten. Frazier is also
a fine runner and utilizes the pass-
run option well. His prime target
is halfback Jon Mars, who is not
only a good receiver but is also one
of the fastest runners who will be
on the field. The Generals will also
be on the watch for power runner
Jim Powers, who can start at either
halfback or fullback.

W&L will be weak along the line
with guard Bill Angel and tackle
Bob Henley out with injuries.
Quarterback Brice Gamber, end
Starke Sydnor, and fullback Dan
Manson will also be sidelined be-
cause of injuries.

The Generals may have to resort

Booters Pick Jackson, Preston

By BILLY CANNON

Soccer Coach Joe Lyles announced
today that Bruce Jackson and Pete
Preston will be the co-captains of
next year’s booters.

Jackson, a Delt from Newington,
Conn., and Preston, a Phi Psi from
Chevy Chase, Md., are both juniors
with three years experience. Jackson
was an All-Stater last year while
playing his left halfback position.
Preston plays center halfback. Coach
Lyles explained, “under our three
deep system Pete is actually a full-
back.”

“Both boys have been outstand-
ing in the past three years,’ com-
mented Lyles. “I’m sure they’ll do
well next fall.”

There is no word as of yet on who
was chosen on the All-State team
this season. It is known that both
Jackson and Preston will be given
a long look when the “top 11”
is picked. They will be joined by

to the short pass as this appears to
be the only offense against which
Washington is weak. In fact, unless
our backs can find some way to
get through the big Bear line, the
aerial may be our only hope.

An interesting point was made in
this morning’s Richmond Times Dis-
patch: the Generals’ blue team half-
backs Henry Sackett and Stu Yoffe
have provided nearly 60 per cent of
the teams total rushing this season,
in carrying the ball 1,039 yards.

Sackett has gained 633 yards in
102 carries—the most for any Gen-
eral since Walt Michaels gained 712
in 1950 during W&L’s big time era.
Providing the other half of the Gen-
erals’ punch, Yoffe has gained 503
yards rushing while scoring 40
points. Sackett has scored 46 points
and was awarded the Ty Rauber
Homecoming Award for his out-
standing performance in the Centre
game October 12.

Swimmers To Begin Season

The Washington and Lee swim-
ming team is now in the process
of daily practices in order to get in
shape for its first meet, December3.
Although graduation last year took
nine men from his squad, Coach
Norris Eastman stated that he was
looking forward to an excellent sea-
son because of the overall depth of
his present squad, and the fine crop
of freshmen out for the team this
year.

Coach Eastman will rely heavily
this season upon his nine returning
lettermen. Senior co-captains Jim
Wallenstein and Walt McManus head
this list which also includes divers
Bruce Houghton and Dave Geer,
juniors John Wolfe, Bill Broaddus,

Larry Donat (B.S.E.E., 1960) is presently a marketing
representative in the special services section of Ohio Bell’s
Cleveland office. Larry must plan communications systems
which allow business machines to talk to each other in
their own language. No wonder he finds the job so in-
teresting and challenging.

He moved to his present assignment after a three-month
course in five basic aspects of data — business machines,
systems analyses, computers, switching and marketing.

Larry was well prepared for his most recent promotion.

It is hoped that Lifter who has been
unable to attend practice because of
a mild case of hepatitis will be
able to start again following the
Thanksgiving break.

Freshmen who drew praise from
Coach Eastman for pre-season per-
formances were Gary Bokinsky, Bart
Taylor, Steve Lester, Bill Wildrick,
and Steve Lundy. In their only
trial so far the swimmers performed
well againt VMI.

He started off as an assistant engineer in the central office
equipment group, where he was responsible for maintain-
ing the operating efficiency of intricate switching equip-
ment. More time was spent in traffic, training, plant,
commercial and various schools, giving him a well-rounded

background in communications.

Larry Donat, like many young engineers, is impatient
to make things happen for his company and himself. There
are few places where such restlessness is more welcomed
or rewarded than in the fast-growing telephone business.

Glee Club

With Miss Virginia

By FRED BISHOP

Doreas Campbell, this year’s Miss
Virginia, and the Washington and
Lee Glee Club, under the direction
of Mr. Robert Stewart, traveled to
Clifton Forge last night to present
a program before the Clifton Forge-
Covington Concert Guild.

The program consisted of two
parts, covering a wide variety of mu-
sic. Among the opening selections
were “College Friendships” Bach’s
“Now Let Every Tongue Adore
Thee,” Vivaldi’s “Domine Deus,” and
Handel’s “Hallelujah Amen.”

The Glee Club continued in a
lighter vein with the musical ver-
sion of e. e. cummings’ poem “sam
was a man,” and another contempor-
ary song “On an Island.”

Soloists Philip Booth and John
Baker followed with “Ten Thousand
Miles Away,” “This Ol’ Hammer,”
and “Without a Song.”

The spotlight next turned to Miss
Campbell, who sang selections from
My Fair Lady, “Romance” from
Romber’s Desert Song, and “Mueset-
ta’s Waltz Song” from Puccini’s La
Boheme. At the piano was Warren
Hopkins.

To conclude the first part of the
program, the Wé&L Brass Choir play-
ed several selections.

The second part of the program |
was launched with songs from musi- |
cal shows. Miss Campbell and John
Baker did a medley of songs from
West Side Story, which included
“Tonight,” “Maria,” “I Feel Pretty,”
They were backed by the Glee Club.
The program was closed with the
“W&L Swing.”

After the concert, the Glee Club,
Brass Choir, and Miss Campbell
were guests at a reception at the

President Kennedy Assassinated In Dallas Motorcade Today

(Continued from page 1)

The text of the speech which the
President was to deliver at a lunch-
eon today onl a short distance from
the hospital where he died, ironical-
ly asks Americans to stop paying so
much attention to the purveyors of
doom and the prophets of defeat.

Dr. Boorman

 

Speaks On Communist Rift

| “The notion that this nation is head-
ed for defeat through deficits or that
strength is but a matter of slogans
is nothing but just plain nonsense,”
reads the speech.
| A 30-30 rifie was apparently the

weapon used by the assassin.

Information was available concern-

 

ing a man being sought by the po-
lice. He is about 30 years old,
white, medium build, weighs about
165 pounds. Time of the slaying was
1:30 ETD.

Conally underwent chest surgery
at 2:30 EST. Doctors said he is not
out of danger but that signs of re-
covery are good.

At word of the assassination the

nation’s stock exchanges were
closed.
President Kennedy arrived in

Texas yesterday to the warm wel-
come of 300,000 people. He entered
Houston on a leg of his tour through
Texas during which he hoped to
settle factional feuding among var-

1ious Texas Democrats. He was at-
| tempting to steady the politically

shaky state which holds a crucial
26 electorial votes.

He opened his tour of Texas with
a strong defense of his space pro-
gram. Speaking in San Antonio, he
helped dedicate the six-million dol-
lar facility at Brooks Air Force
Base.

Last night in Houston, he was the
main speaker at a dinner in honor
of Rep. Albert Thomas. Tonight, the
President was supposed to have
been the guest of honor at a re-
ception given by Governor John
Connally.

With the President yesterday and
today were the Vice President,
Governor Connally, and Mrs. Ken-
nedy. President Kennedy was mak-
ing every effort to place himself
in front of the voters. President
Kennedy carried the state of Texas
by only a slight margin over Rich-

ard Nixon in the last Presidential
election.

President Kennedy and his wife
were to be the guests tonight of
Vice President and Mrs. Johnson
at their ranch near Johnson City.
The presidential party was to return
to Washington tomorrow.

Fact or Empty Words?

Kennedy’s speech in Dallas al-
ready had been released to news-
men. In his prepared remarks he
lashed out at the critics whom he
said confuse rhetoric with reality.

He said that ignorance and mis-
information, if allowed to prevail in
foreign police handicaps this coun-
try’s security.

Kennedy also took a jibe at critics
of his economic and financial poli-
cies. He said that they fear hordes
of civil servants more than they do
hordes of opposing armies.

Fort Worth Address

The president also did some cam-
paigning in the rain in Fort Worth.
Addressing a gathering of about
1,000 in a parking lot, he said there
was no faint hearts among those who
had turned out in the early morn-
ing rainfall. Referring to the first
lady, he said she wasn’t present
‘because it took her longer to get
organized in the morning. He added:
“But of course she looks better than
we do.”

Chancellor Gaines Speaks
At ODK Lap Assembly

By HUBIE YOUNG

Dr. Francis Pendleton Gaines, Chancellor of the Univer-
sity has been selected to speak at the 49th Annual ODK Tap
Day Assembly. Don Partington, president of Washington
and Lee’s ODK chapter, has announced that the assembly will |

be held on December 17 at 12 o’clock noon in Doremus Gym.- ||
nasium and will be followed by a*

banquet in Evans Hall for both old
and newly-tapped members.

Dr. Gaines, noted as one of the
South’s greatest orators, received his
A.B. degree from the University of
Richmond, his A.M. from the Uni-
versity of Chicago, his Ph.D. from
Columbia, and his Litt.D. from Duke
and Columbia. In 1930 he accepted
the presidency of Washington and
Lee and held that office until 1959.
Upon his retirement he was made
Chancellor of the University. In ad-
dition, he has received honorary
degrees from the following schools:
Baylor, Furman, Mercer, Richmond,
Wake Forest, William Jewell, Se-
wanee, University of Chattanooga,
University of North Carolina,
Waynesburg College, Hampden-Syd-
ney, Rollins, and Washington and
Lee.

An ODK member himself, Dr.
Gaines has served as president of
the Woodrow Wilson Birthplace
Foundation, director of the George
C. Marshall Foundation, and presi-
dent of the Cooperative Education
Association of Virginia. He is also
the author of three books, The
Southern Plantation, Lee—The Final
Achievement, and Southern Oratory.

Forty-Ninth Assembly

The assembly will be the forty-
ninth in which ODK taps new mem-
bers from the student body, the
faculty, and the alumni. New mem-
bers are selected by old members
on the basis of leadership and cit-
izenship in various aspects of uni-
versity life, and all student members
must be in the upper 35 per cent
of their class in scholastic standing.

Goals of ODK

Omicron Delta Kappa is an honor-
ary leadership fraternity founded at
Washington and Lee in 1914 for the
purpose of “bringing together cam-
pus leaders in a more relaxed at-
mosphere.” In the past forty-nine
years chapters or circles have been
established in more than ninety col-
leges and _ universities located
throughout the country. ODK today
is dedicated to recognizing superior
citizenship and leadership among
students, faculty members, and
alumni. Washington and Lee’s chap-
ter dedicates itself to fulfilling three

 

 

goals: 1) Recognizing men who have
attained efficiency in collegiate ac-
tivities; 2) Bringing together the
most representative men in_ all
phases of college life; 3) Collecting
members of the faculty and student
body on a basis of mutual interest
and understanding.

Due to this assembly, Dean Pusey
has announced that there will be
short classes on Tuesday, Decem-
ber 17. Classes will begin at 8:25
a.m., and will run for forty minutes,
ending at 11:45 am. The assembly
will begin at noon.

mocracy and is author of Freedom
of Thought in the Old South, A
History of the Old South, A History
of the Southern Confederacy, A
Brief Biography of Henry Clay and
The Growth of Southern Civiliza-
tion,

A native of North Carolina, he

ed as head of the Department of
History of Lafayette College before
joining the faculty of the University
of Kentucky, where he has served

He was a Guggenheim Fellow in
1945-46 and was elected Distin-
guished Professor of the Year at

East-West Differences
Emphasized By Nagy

By JOHN SHARP

Mr. Ferenc Nagy, Hungarian po-
litical leader, spoke on “The States-
man in the Free World and in
Communism,” last night at VMI.

Mr. Nagy was co-founder and
President of the Independent Small-
holder’s Party and the Hungarian
Peasants’ Association; Hungarian
Minister of Reconstruction, President
of the Parliament in 1945, and Prime
Minister of Hungary in 1946 and
1947. When his government was
averthrown by the Communists, Mr.
Nagy went into exile. He has since
served as Chairman of the Assembly
of Captive Nations, has traveled ex-
tensively, and has written a book,
Struggle Behind the Iron Curtain.

Mr. Nagy pointed out the differ-
ence in the attitudes and actions
of democratic and communist states-
men. Showing great admiration for
the West, he remarked that he would
leave the similarities of the two
camps to be shown by someone
less well acquainted with Commun-
ism than he. Using parallel state-
ments, Mr. Nagy discussed contrasts
in methods of coming to power, the
role of the people in government,
forcign relations, personal character-
istics of statesmen, attitudes toward
the preservation of peace, and the
role of economics in Free World and
Communist states.

As one would expect, both the
U.S.S.R. and Red China were severe-
ly criticized in Mr. Nagy’s talk. Many
examples used to drive points home

were the forceful result of first-
hand observations. The duplicity of
Stalin was clearly shown by the

citing of Stalin’s personal guarantee

of Hungary’s independence, given
only one year before a Russian-
backed revolution overthrew the

Nagy government in 1947.

In a question and answer period,
Mr. Nagy continued to phrase his
opinions in strong terms. He said
that the Hungarian Revolution of
1956 neither expected nor needed
Western military aid. He expressed
little fear that Russia would out-
strip the West in production, in

 

spite of their emphasis on heavy
industry, and, due to his personal
experiences with the Soviets, placed
little faith in the durability of the
recent test-ban treaty.

In summary, the man himself was
of almost as much interest as his
talk, which was founded on per-
sonal experience and national hard-
ship.

 

NOTICE
The only placement interview un-
til Thursday, December 12, was to
be that of the representative of

the Stanford University Graduate
School.

* convention in which Washington and
Lee students will attempt to predict
the Republican presidential candi-
date in the 1964 election.

The announcement of Dr. Judd as
the 1964 speaker was made by Philip
D. Sharp, Jr., senior law student
from Richmond who is chairman of
the 1964 Republican Mock Conven-
tion.

Sharp said members of the conven-
tion’s student steering committee are
delighted at Dr. Judd’s acceptance
of their invitation.

“We are very fortunate to obtain
the same man the Republican Party
itself chose in 1960 to keynote its
national convention in Chicago,”
Sharp said. “Dr. Judd is one of
America’s foremost orators and I’m
confident his address to our conven-
tion will set the tone for one of our
most challenging of all mock con-
ventions.”

Was Medical Missionary

A former medical missionary to
China, where he survived attacks
from malaria and Communist ban-
dits, Dr. Judd was elected to Con-
gress from Minnesota’s Fifth District
in Minneapolis in 1942. He subse-
quently served ten terms in the
House before being defeated in 1962.

Dr. Judd is a nationally recog-
nized authority on United States
foreign policy. He served 16 years
as a member of the Committee on
Foreign Affairs, and he played im-
portant roles in establishing Amer-
ican relief, recovery, re-armament
and economic development programs
for the United States allies abroad.

When the Republican Party an-
nounced him as its choice for the
1960 convention keynote address,
Time magazine described him as
“one of the most remarkable men in
Congress.”

Twenty universities and colleges
have conferred on Dr. Judd honor-
ary degrees. In a Congressional
poll in 1962 he was voted by his
colleagues in the House one of its
five most influential members, the
only one so named from the mi-
nority party. He was selected by
his Republican colleagues as the
Congressman they “most admired.”
The New York Times has said of
him: “Among his greatest assets is
a reputation for absolute integri-
——

Since 1908, Washington and Lee
students have sought to name the
candidate for the party out of power,
and in seven of eleven previous
mock conventions they have success-
fully forecast the choice of the
national party balloting. Not since
they chose Arthur Vandenburg in-
stead of Thomas Dewey in 1948 have
W&L students been wrong.

Outstanding party spokesmen tra-
ditionally keynote the event. In 1960,
former President Harry S. Truman
addressed a Democratic mock con-
vention, and in 1956, Senator Alben
W. Barkley, Truman’s former vice-
president, was nearing the end of
his keynote oration when he col-
lapsed and died of a heart attack
before nearly 2,000 persons in Wash-
ington and Lee’s Doremus Gym-
nasium.

Washington and Lee students
pride themselves on the authenticity
of their mock conventions, and per-
sonal preferences do not influence
their balloting.

Student planners have been busy
since mid-summer setting up a po-
litical intelligence system which they
hope will reflect accurately the
strength of various GOP candidates
in the fifty states and overseas ter-
ritories.

A Good Choice For ’64 Keynoter

It is the boast of past Washington and Lee Mock Con-
ventions that they have been the most authentic, most realistic,
of all mock conventions. The presence of Dr. Walter Judd at
the 1964 Mock Convention will go a long way toward achiev-
ing the authenticity which has always made the W&L Conven-

large percentage of the letters to
the editor have concerned the “tra-
dition” of conventional dress.

There seems to be a large (or at
least articulate) number of students
here who feel that being forced to
wear coat and tie to class is an af-
front to their human dignity and an
attempt to squash their individuality.
Usually these people send in letters
urging the total abolishment of the
“tradition” so they can be individuals

tion stand out from the others. Dr. Judd is generally recog-
nized as one of the several gifted political orators of today,
and of course there is no better recommendation for a speaker
than for him to have delivered the keynote address at one of
his party’s conventions. To obtain as W&L keynoter the man
who served in this capacity at the last Republican Convention
is a fine beginning for Phil Sharp and the Steering Committee.

Judd’s great 1960 keynote address has been much publi-
cized, but a fact less known is that at the Chicago convention
he was also called upon to nominate Henry Cabot Lodge as
Republican candidate for vice president. At this second appear-
ance before the Convention, Dr. Judd was honored with a
lengthy standing ovation before he could even begin his speech.
Once again his address demonstrated rare ability, and when he
finished the Convention again erupted with tremendous ap-
plause and with floor demonstrations. Dr. Judd indeed ex-
hibited the skill of a master political speechmaker, one adept
not only at ripping into the opposition, but also at presenting
issues clearly.

The Minnesotan’s abilities go father than platform ora-
tory—he is also noted as a valuable legislater. During 20 years
of service in Congress he became a leading member of the
House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Dr. Judd was fittingly
introduced to the 1960 Convention as “a man—a leader—of
courage, of wisdom and of no thought of self.” The Ring-tum
Phi seconds the statement made by Phil Sharp: The delegates
to the Convention will have a chance to hear a truly great
American, and I am sure his address will set the tone for a most

adamant

successful Convention.”

Cockshutt Stresses Need For
More Interested Electorate

By ROD COCKSHUTT

“J need your help. I cannot do it
alone.”
President Lyndon Johnson ad-
dressing Joint session of Con-
gress, November 27, 1963

If you’re like us, your response to
this dramatic plea by our new Presi-
dent was two sided. On the one hand
there was a very real feeling of
eagerness to be of service to the
nation in a dark hour. But at the
same time there was a kind of crip-
pling uncertainty about just what
it is we are to do.

Far removed, as we seem to be,
from the powerful political mechan-
ism that keeps this country moving,
we are faced with a feeling of
frustrating impotence when it comes
to the matter of our personal influ-
ence on the course this nation fol-
lows in national and international
affairs. What can we as student-
citizens do to help in this era of
seemingly unending crisis? There are
several things.

First, those of us who are able
to can register to vote. A repre-
sentative government such as ours
depends on an informed and active
electorate which willingly exer-
cises its privilege of franchise. Stu-
dents from Kentucky and Georgia
can vote at the age of 18; the rest
of us at 21. A trip to the county or
parish Board of Elections over the
Christmas vacation would be one
way in which many of our eligible,
but still unregistered, students
could serve this country in a very
fundamental manner.

Of course, whether we are to vote
or not, we must be better informed
than we are. Perhaps if more of us
realized that next year this time
we could be carrying a rifle in the

 

jungles of South Viet Nam or at the
Berlin Wall, the day to day news

would take on a greater significance.
What happens today anywhere in
the world can affect us tomorrow,
and there is no escaping that fact.
It would seem we have a responsi-
bility to become more conversant
on the crucial domestic and foreign
issues we as a nation, and as indi-
viduals, must face.

Thirdly, we can become better ac-
quainted with our senators and con-
gressman—who they are and what
they stand for. We can and should
follow their voting records on major
issues and voice approval or disap-
proval as the situation warrants it.
Otherwise, we have little cause for
complaint.

Finally, more of us can think
seriously about serving the nation
in a more specifically vocational
sense. There are exciting and re-
warding opportunities for service
in governmental agencies, the for-
eign service, the Peace Corps and
a host of other areas. Nor should
we overlook the possibility of
elected office. If politics is “dirty,”
it is up to those members of the
citizenry with the appropriate per-
sonal and intellectual talents to do
something about it.

Indeed, there is much to be done,
and all of us who care about this
country are involved. To quote Pres-
ident Johnson once again: “ A great
leader is dead, a nation must move
on. Yesterday is not ours to recover,
but tomorrow is ours to win or to
lose.” That “ours” includes all of us.

all of the students, except for a

handful of malcontents (probably
socialists), love to wear coat and
tie everywhere and would feel de-
nuded without them.

In the midst of all this controver-
sy, no one has bothered to consult
the student body as to its felings
about “tradition.” By the very defi-
nition of a tradition as a “belief,” it
must be voluntarily perpetuated by
those whom it directly concerns. Ac-
tually, no one can say with certain-
ty what the student body believes in
this matter of conventional dress.

And after all, whether to retain
conventional dress or not is a de-
cision to be made only by the stu-
dents...they are the ones whom
the “tradition” affects.

Our Reputation Unaffected

To say that the abolishment of
conventional dress would weaken the
students’ moral fibre or alienate our
benefactors is absurd. The main pur-
pose of this school is the spread-
ing of knowledge—not having the
students run around in coat and tie.
Moreover, whether we keep con-
ventional dress or not does not af-
fect our national reputation a bit;
W&L is known for its academic
excellence and not for the neatly
dressed students who attend.

If the student body is really in-
terested in finally coming to a deci-
sion on conventional dress, it could
easily do so by a simple vote—a
plebiscite. Such a plebiscite could be
readily set up by the Executive
Committee in the same fashion as
the yearly elections. A vote could
be held by ballot in the Student
Union on a set date as to whether
enforced conventional dress should
be continued or not. Such a plebis-
cite could even be made an annual
affair in order to register the chang-
ing popular sentiment.

If the people are interested, a de-
cision of this sort could be reached
and put into effect by the semester’s
end. All that is required to set a
plebiscite on conventional dress into
motion is an executive decision by
the EC, the only body on campus
with the necessary authority.

John Osborne’s new play, Luther

merits Kenneth Tynan’s praise of
it as “the most eloquent piece of

Tapestries On Display
Tonight In duPont Hall

A public exhibition of tapestries
and woven forms by Lenore Tawney
will be on display tonight in the
duPont Hall gallery.

The exhibition which is in its
fifth day of showing, consists of 23
pieces, some of which are 15 feet
in height. It is the first Virginia
showing of the work of Miss Tawney,
whose “woven forms” incorporate
techniques that art critics have de-
scribed as unique.

Included in the display will be
Miss Tawney’s 81 - square - foot
“Sight,” “The Moment,” “The House
of the Square Foot,’ and Primal
Garment,” all of a three-dimensional
concept in natural black linen.

The exhibition is sponsored by

only on pages,” and that the printed
page was the best, most uncompro-
mising medium for the eye’s exper-
ience in the Newtonian world.

Before Miss Moore, several writers
had attempted accurate descriptions.
Kenner cited Wordsworth’s “West-
minster Bridge,’ a description of
London in the early morning, and
Ruskin’s description of a fir tree as
examples. Though Wordsworth
succeeded only in making an inven-
tory of what he saw, it was a start.
Ruskin carried the tradition a bit
farther when he described the fir
tree as having outstretched arms
which hold flat tables of leaves
spread over like shields and spread-
ing out like hands.

This is the tradition which Miss
Moore has inherited and enriched,
a tradition of strict translation
from the purely visible to the
type-written page. She does this
not only by the abundant use of
comparisons, but also by the ar-
rangement of the lines on the page
itself, so that the shape of the
poem serves to convey some of her
intentions.

The poems are justified, according
to Kenner, not in the satisfaction
derived from them by the poet, but
only in the homage they pay to the
subject.

Several volumes of Miss Moore’s
poetry have been published during
the last 50 years. A revised edition
of her first volume received the
Dial Award in 1925. She has re-
ceived a succession of awards for her
poetry, in 1932, 1935, 1944, and 1951.
These were culminated in 1952 when

Since only $512 was made from the

There has been word that the
game is being investigated by the
N.C.A.A. as the unofficial score book
differs greatly from the official
seoreboard. The unofficial score
placed the all-stars on top 38-24.

Leading the all-stars, coached by
John Heinzerling, Gordon Gay and
Bob Barclay, was Steve Henry

3 from the foul line. Next for the
all-stars were Tom Burton (Beta),
Fred Schaeffer (DTD), Mike Mich-

(Phi Psi) scored three while Randy
Poore (Kappa Sig), Bret Thackston

Dr. Kozak and Nichols both had
perfect nights at the foul line. Dr.
Kozak was three for three; Nichols
two for two.

The all-stars utilized a four pla-

equal chance to participate. Repre-
senting the other fraternities were
George Miller (PEP), Tabor Novak

Generals Open;
Wrestle UNC

Last night, preceding the faculty-
fraternity game, General fans saw a
preview of Washington and Lee’s
1963-64 wrestling team.

The team, termed by coach Dick
Miller “the best balanced squad I
have ever had,” opens its season
Saturday at home against North Car-
olina. The Tar Heels are the Gener-
als’ customary first opponent.

Coach Miller’s big problem has
been to pick his starters from the
available talent. Although he lost
three of last year’s regulars—Dave
Montgomery (130), Dick Albert
(167), and Jud Babcock (heavy-
weight)—who helped the team to an
8-2 record, Miller should have ample
replacements.

Freshman Dick Musick, in the 130
pound class, has not lost a match
since his freshman year in high

Henry Makes Team

Tim Henry of W&L was awarded
for the second straight year a berth
on the All-State soccer team
Wednesday at the Interscholastic
Soccer Association Banquet in Char-
lottesville.

Henry was the Generals’ only first
team selection, although five players
received honorable mention—Bruce
Jackson, Howard Busse, Wes Hor-
ner, and Chris Clark.

The V.LS.A. chose Paul Saylor of
Virginia as the most valuable over-
all player. Randolph-Macon’s Woody
Stokes was named the most valuable
offensive player, and Glenn Taylor
of Lynchburg the most valuable de-
fensive player.

Coach Joe Lyles said he felt the
judges leaned too heavily in their
decisions on the tournament play

 

I-M

Defending basketball champ SAE
won its first game, 67-26, defeating
Sigma Chi. Fred Ridolphi and Gene
Pearce each scored 16 for the vic-
tors. SAE’s next three opponents—
Law, Delt, and ZBT, who downed
Law, 28-19, in its opener. Stu Yoffe
and company kept Law outside with
a pressing defense, and led all the
way.

PiKA upset Kappa Sig, 28-27, but
a protest has been lodged. The
claim—ref Art Broaddus erred. Sig-
ma Nu downed Pi Phi, 27-23, de-
spite Bill Manley (16 points, 20 re-
bounds). Phi Delt, under “coach
Lou Paterno, opened up a 22-0 lead
on NFU, hung on to win 59-27.

The best: 1. SAE, 1-0; 2. Sigma
Nu, 1-0; 3. ZBT, 1-0.

In handball, Beta, champ last year,
beat PEP, 5-0. PiKA, second last
year, beat Sigma Nu, 4-1. In other
matches: Law forfeited to SAE; Phi
Gam edged Lambda Chi, 3-2; SPE
beat Phi Kappa Sig, 4-1; and Delt
downed Phi Psi, 5-0. The best: Beta,
1-0, 2. Delt, 1-0; 3. PiKA, 1-0.

A strong ZBT team downed a weak
KA team in bowling, with Arthur
Sher scoring a 200 game. In other
matches, Beta featured a well-bal-
anced team in defeating SPE, 2173-
2098; and Phi Phi beat PEP by 200
pins. Top game of the week—202,
by Pi Phi’s Steve Millard.

The best: 1. Kappa Sig, 2-0; 2.
Phi Psi, 2-0; 3. Phi Kappa Sig, 1-0.

Phi Gam looked like the best in
wrestling as they ran over SAE,
While KA was edging Delt, 18-12.

Generals Begin Basketball;
Meet Old Dominion There

Washington and Lee’s basketball quintet is in for what
could be a rough night in tomorrow’s clash with the Monarchs

of Old Dominion College.

The shooters of Coach Bob McHenry will be meeting a
team with more height and experience when they venture into

Norfolk. In this, the Generals’

first outing, they will have to

 

stop a high scoring team that almost*
upset Loyola of Baltimore last week
before dropping the contest, 79-75.

In two games this week, Old Do-
minion lost to Atlantic Christian,
96-89, and beat Pembroke State, 83-
65.

“We're going to have to really
scrap if we want to win this one,”
commented McHenry. “It’s hard to
say how good we are without play-
ing anyone, but the loss of a guy
like Bip Fauber must hurt you.”

In a full scrimmage Tuesday, the
varsity defeated the freshmen, 76-
48. The freshman team opened their
season this afternoon at Augusta
Military.

With four lettermen returning,
W&L’s strong point is their back-
court. There Lou Paterno and Don
Wallis, if he can shake a cold, will

 

start. Captain Tom Supak can move
in to fill Wallis’ spot if necessary.

The forward position shapes up as
a family squabble with ZBT’s Supak,
Steve Sweitzer, and Fred Mindel
fighting for the starting spots. Howie
Martin will open at center, but he
is being pushed by 6-5 Bob Spes-
sard.

Seven of W&L’s 12 varsity players
come from the sophomore and fresh-
man classes. Experience could defi-
nitely be a liability in early games.
but the main problem facing coach
McHenry will be the team’s lack of
height. With the exception of Martin
and Spessard, the Generals are with-
out a player over 6-2.

McHenry said, “We're going to
have to slow down and take the

Chaplin Reviews ‘Luther’

(Continued from page 2) |

on a privy and releasing, from the
top of the painting, the souls of the
damned.
Luther’s Devil

Osborne has taken up this image
of filth and excrement and given it|
to Luther’s own vision of the Devil,
thus amplifying the view that the
Protestant Reformation began on the
privy. For Luther’s physical seizure
is a result of constipation, and he is
known to have said that the words
“Justice of God” came to him to have
the meaning of “salvation by faith”
while he himself sat on the privy.
For this reason, Osborne’s attention
to this aspect of Luther’s conception
of the world is not exaggerated. If
anything, it helps to crystalize Luth-
er’s feeling that the world is owned
by the Devil, and that we live in
the land of sin and filth. In this act,
Luther is engaged in an interesting
dialogue with the Vicar General of
the Augustine Order, Father Stem-
patz. A few lines will serve to illus-
trate Luther’s feelings.

L: “Tell me, Father, have you

 

never felt humiliated to find that
you belong to a world that’s dy-
ing?”

S: “No, I don’t think I have.” |

L: “Surely, this must be the last
age of time we're living in. There |
can’t be any more left but the
black bottom of the bucket.”

S: “Do you mean the Last Judg-
ment?”

L: “No, I don’t mean that. The
Last Judgment isn’t to come. It’s
here and now.”

S: “Good. That’s a little better,
anyway.”

L: “I’m like a ripe stool in the
world’s straining anus, and at any
moment we're about to let each

Luther is sickened by the stench
of the Devil which surrounds him.
It is this stench which directs his
agony in the working out his own
salvation; it is this stench that is
the agony of living.

While act three recedes in dra-
matic intensity and presents a para-
doxical, and inconclusive, portrait
of Luther’s position regarding the
peasants’ uprising, which came as a
result of what he had preached, and
from which he disassociated himself
to condemn the action, it gives a
fine picture of him before the Diet
of Worms, and ends _ successfully |
with him at home with his wife and
son, where he is hopeful of his son’s
future, and hopeful for the struggle
of humanity to gain and regain the

“Our matches with them are always

a 23-6-1 margin in their series with
the Tar Heels, and won last year,

Miller’s charges have compiled an

Hymns, Readings To Be Highlight
Of Christmas Candlelight Service

By Howard Epstein

With plans already in the final
stages, the University Christian As-
sociation announced yesterday the
format of their annual University
Christmas Candlelight Service.

The service, patterned after those
produced yearly by the Kings Col-
lege in England and broadcast over
B.B.C., will be held in the Robert
E. Lee Memorial Church at 10 p.m.
Thursday, December 19.

This year’s program is similar to
that of previous years. The cere-
monies will open with carols by the
John A. Graham Brass Choir led by
Prof. Robert Stewart, followed by
the processional hymn, “Adeste Fe-
deles,” and the invocation by Dr.
David Sprunt. Then in an alternat-
ing fashion, nine lessons will be
read interspaced between carols led
by the Glee Club.

Each of the lessons will be read by

a different person: Frank J. Gilliam,
Dean Emeritus; Dr. James G. Ley-
burn; Dr. Fitzgerald Flournoy; Dr.
Louis W. Hodges; Prof. John K. Jen-
nings; Dr. Cecil D. Jones; Dr. James
K. Shillington; Dr. George F. Drake;
and Bill Noell, President of the Stu-
dent Body.

Between the sixth and seventh
lessons, the U.C.A. will present its
annual offering to the Rockbridge
County Welfare Department. Fol-
lowing the lessons, Dr. Sprunt will
deliver the benediction. The cere-
monies will then conclude with the
recessional, “Joy to the World,” and
a fanfare by the Brass Choir.

It is also pointed out by Robin
Kell, chairman of the Worship Com-
mittee, that the services were not
held in Lee Chapel this year due
to fire regulations. However, he ex-
pressed hope that in future years the

Topic Unannounced

Student Leaders 'To Discuss
Conventional Dress Problem

 

|

 

The topic of Grenier’s speech has not yet been
announced, but it will probably deal with the profes-
sional party men who are in the background of every
election. This is the role that Grenier has assumed in
the Republican Party. The speech will be non-partisan
and is being set up as a part of the pre-convention
activities symposium to inform W&L students of the
structure of the Republican Party.

As one of the original members in the draft-Gold-
water movement, Grenier is one of the top leaders in
the Goldwater campaign.

Reception After Speech

After his speech Mr. Grenier will attend a recep-
tion at the Kappa Sigma House. Anyone interested in
talking to Mr. Grenier is urged to attend this recep-
tion where partisan subjects may be discussed.

Blaine Brownell, chairman of the Alabama dele-
gation for the Mock Convention, has announced that
Grenier hopes to attend the Mock Convention in the
Spring as a guest of the Alabama Delegation.

the Assimilation Committee, ROTC,
the Glee Club, the UCA, SWMSFC,

Since the last dinner of this na-
ture, held on October 9, a steering
committee has been debating the
future role of the Forum. A four-
man sub-committee was chosen to
draft a constitution, which it did.
This first effort was voted down by
the committee as a whole, and re-
vised constitution will be submitted
to the entire Forum for its approval
tonight.

As the constitution now stands,
the Forum would have the right of
making resolutions—in effect recom-
mendations—vis-a-vis problems on
campus. It would have no actual
power insofar as the passage of real
legislation is concerned.

A graduate of the University of |

his Ph. D. Degree from Harvard
University. He was a Guggenheim
Fellow in 1945-46, and was elected
Distinguished Professor of the Year
at Kentucky in 1956. He also served

Debate Breaks
Even At NYU

Debating at the New York Uni-
versity debate tournament in New
York City this past weekend, the
Washington and Lee debate team

| compiled a five and five record, dis-

playing major wins over Yale and
Columbia, as well as host NYU. They
defeated also City College of New
York and Carnegie Institute of
Technology.

University of Maine was the sharp-
est thorn as they defeated both W&L
affirmative and negative teams. Cor-
nell, Fordham, and Connecticut
Southern served the other defeats.

Debating the affirmative with a
final 3-2 posting were John Mc-
Murry and Sam Frazier, while a
with reversed 2-3 record, for the
negative, were Bill Grant and Bill
Cannon.

Of the 29 schools entered, debate
coach Chaffin estimates that Wash-
ington and Lee finished somewhere
near the middle, but could not be
definite the tournament calcu-
lated only the first few places, the
first being won by Georgetown Uni-
versity of Washington, D.C.

Mike Hayslip and Ed Fitzgerald,
who had earlier this year compiled
a 2-3 record at Duquesne Invita-
tional tournament in Pittsburgh, will
debate both affirmative and nega-
tive positions at the Wake Forest
tournament at Winston-Salem this
weekend.

The national topic for the year is,
“Resolved: that the Federal Govern-
ment should guarantee to every high
school graduate the opportunity for
higher education,”

as

 

“cultivated the art of being a gentle-
man.” The emphasis of southern gen-
tility was on versatility and good
manners. Dr. Eaton further pointed
out the deep appreciation of the
value of the family, and the sense of
chivalry which was so much a part
of southern virtue.

Balanced Government

“The concept of a balanced gov-
ernment,” Dr. Eaton continued,
“was the basis of southern political
feeling.” He underscored the value
of vitality in local government as
the source of the strongest patrio-
tism . In addition to these Dr. Eaton
cites the “cherished martial virtues”
and the high sense of honor as re-
flecting the true southern environ-
ment. “The essence of the Old
South” was summarized by Dr.
Eaton as “an unusual sense of his-
tory—almost the burden of history.”

In excerpts from his soon-to-be-
published book From the Mind of
the Old South, Dr. Eaton spoke on
the life of William L. Yancy of Ala-
bama, the orator of secession. Dr.
Eaton described Yancey as the “ster-
eotype of a southern gentleman,”
and yet a high spirited and impet-
uous man. It was unfortunate, ac-
cording to Dr. Eaton, that Yancey
came to the forefront at a time when
he was able to sway the southern
moderate to secession by his power
of oratory.

Discusses His Novel

Yancey’s role in politics, both na-
tional and local, was discussed at
length by Dr. Eaton. From his law
practice in Alabama to his eventual
rise to Congress, Dr. Eaton sees in
Yancey the elements of radical po-
litical zeal. His “sectional bent” and
his support of the so called “Ala-
bama Platform” dealing with the
Texas question illustrate in Dr.
Eaton’s words, “Yancey’s obsession
with southern rights.”

Dr. Eaton pointed to the tremen-
dous appeal of Yancey’s oratory in
the southern environment. Yancey
used the technique of the “camp
meeting,” according to Dr. Eaton,
he followed the tradition of great

orators by “speaking the truth as
truth.”
Dr. Eaton concluded his lecture

by turning to the origins of the col-
lapse of the Union. He attributed it
primarily to the fear of most South-
erners of an uncertain future. The
southerner realized the frantic de-
termination of the North to change
his way of life, and in the opinion of

Dr. Eaton yielded to the voice of his |

own radical element. Thus in the
1950’s “the voice of emotion had pre-
vailed in the South,”

FD Costumes
Offer Variety
Of Disguises

By MIKE HASH
Assistant News Editor

Steve Hibbard, vice-president of
the Dance Board, announced today
that costumes for the Fancy Dress
Ball are on sale. They were sold
from the Student Union this after-
noon beginning at 2; sales closed at
3 p.m.

Mardi Gras

A large variety of costumes are
available for the February weekend.
As the theme for the Fancy Dress
Ball will be “Mardi Gras,” the pos-
sibilities are unlimited. Available are
animal suits, pirate outfits, Old South
costumes, Greek and Roman citizens
and soldiers, Spanish motifs, clowns,
Indians, Roaring Twenties, Dutch,
and full dress.

The unusually extensive inven-
tory is due in part to the recent
purchases by the Oak Hill Rental
Service in Roanoke of the Triple
A Costume Shop in Atlanta. This
move has made Oak Hill the largest
costume distributor in the South,
and it is particularly well-stocked
with costumes for a “Mardi Gras”
theme.

Prices Low

Costumes for the girls may also be
obtained. Students may make their
own costumes, in fact, as long as
they are “within reason.” The price
is down again this year—$8.00. They
go on sale again tomorrow: 9:30 to
1:00 and 2 to 5. Costumes should be
ordered early despite the wide var-
iety, because size may still be a
problem.

W&L Given
Old Papers

A special exhibit of newspapers
relating to the assassinations of
President Lincoln and Garfield are
on exhibition in the display case in
the library of the Department of
Journalism and Communications in
Payne Hall.

The newspapers are a gift of Earle
Palmer Brown, 44, of Washington,
D.C., to the archives of the Depart-
ment. One is a copy of the New York
Herald for Wednesday, April 26,
1865, describing funeral ceremonies
for Abraham Lincoln in New York
City.

The other is a copy of the Brook-
lyn Daily Eagle for Tuesday, Sept.
20, 1881, and gives an account of the
death of James A. Garfield at the
Elberon Hotel in Long Branch, N. J.,
with accounts of reactions in the
nation and abroad.

 

Albright to Manage
Evans Dining Hall

William G. Albright has assumed
his new duties as manager of the
Slater Food Service at Evans Dining
Hall.

Mr. Albright succeeds Merle
Campbell Bartley who has held the
position since the dining hall was
opened in 1958. Mr. Bartley now
manages one of the Slater-served
cafeterias at North Carolina State.

Although a native of Georgia, Mr.
Albright calls Florida his home. He
graduated from the St. Petersburg
high school and is a graduate of
Florida State University, majoring in
restaurant and hotel management.
While doing graduate work at Flor-
ida State, he was a partner in a
restaurant business in Tallahassee.

Following this, Mr. Albright serv-

ed as director of food service at
the Bainbridge Air Base in Georgia
and later with the Dobbs House

chain, serving as manager of a coffee
shop at the Atlanta Municipal Air-
port and manager of an _ airport
restaurant in Birmingham, Ala.
| Other Caferteria management work
| has been at Tennessee State College
and the University of Alabama.

Mr. Albright is married and has
| two sons, aged eight and eleven. He
| plans to move his family to Lexing-
| ton during the Christmas holidays.

EC’s Hold On The Press—
Should It Be Tolerated?

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT FIRES EDITOR OF
NEW YORK HERALD.TRIBUNE

Preposterous? Yes. But here on our quiet little campus,
the Executive Committee of the Student Body can fire
either or both of the editors of The Ring-tum Phi. If any-
thing in our constitution should be omitted or changed, it
is Article V, Section G: “It (the Executive Committee)
shall have jurisdiction of the Publications Board and
Dance Board, and may after notice and hearing, and upon
two-thirds vote of the entire Committee at two succes-
sive meetings, reverse any order of either Board.”

Governmental control of the press is certainly a flaw
in any system which purports to be democratic—so why
hasn’t the point been brought to the attention of the stu-
dent body previously? A glance at the gallery of Ring-tum
Phi Editors over the past years provides the answer: last
year, one editor was also an EC member; the year before,
one editor was also an EC member; the year before that,
one editor was also an EC member; and the year before
that, (1959-60), neither editor was a member of the rul-
ing class. A stupid oversight. But the year before that—
1958-59—one editor was on the EC, and the other was his
fraternity brother.

EC Should Be Most Criticized

Is it strange, therefore, that the history of W&L re-
veals very little criticism of the EC? Yet, of all the organ-
izations at W&L, the Executive Committee should be the
most criticized. Considering its power, it should be open
to inspection by any interested student. ‘“‘Why isn’t it?”
Asks E. Martin Flurb, Class of ’65. Well—whenever the
EC makes a small—or large “boo boo,” it tells—oops—
advises the Ring-tum Phi not to say anything about it.

Added to this is the fact that members of the student
press don’t get a chance to know about very many mis-
takes which the EC makes, because that committee won’t
let members of the newspaper staffs into their meetings
when anything of real consequence is being discussed.
We hasten to point out that several members of the EC
would like full press coverage of all meetings, and thus the
entire committee should not be blamed for the ostrich
complex which a few of its members seem to have.

 

More Coverage Needed

We've been rather flippant in telling this sad tale and
our mood has been purposeful. We happen to think that
the student body has a right to know what the EC is
doing—all the time; what it is thinking about matters
which concern us. How it is going about solving our prob-
lems—or if it is even considering the problems about
which we are most concerned. All we want to do is publish
what the EC is doing each week—every student has a right
to know—and then at least we’ll have had a chance to
form an opinion about our student leadership, or decide
that we don’t really care.

President Bill Noell has said, before many witnesses,
that he believes student government should be a mutual
thing, not something determined by a small minority of
the student body. Yet we have reason to believe that a
small minority of that small minority called the EC is run-
ing our student government. We would like to see a Stu-
dent Senate with a veto power over the EC; we believe the
present constitution needs revision in several places; we
believe that Bill Noell should show that he believes what
he said about mutual government.

Or are we fired?

Open Criticism A Must

A very perceptive student who has been at W&L for
a long time said that he hates to see the Executive Com-
mittee criticized. His reason is a good one: this commit-
tee is vested with the responsibility of deciding the guilt or
innocence of fellow students charged with an honor vio-
lation. The task they have is an awesome one—it is no
fun to have to tell a student he must leave Washington and
Lee, with no chance for parole.

It follows, then, that criticism directed at the EC takes
something away from the respect which they must have in
order to carry out their job successfully. It is in this very
point, however, that the great weakness of our present
system shows itself. The EC is responsible not only for
judicial decisions, but for executive and legislative matters
as well. And certainly these latter two departments should
be subject to criticism. That is what we have chosen to do
in the above editorial.

It is our firm belief that the students responsible for
decision in honor cases should be charged with that par-
ticular task, and no other. But since that is not the case,
we have no choice but to criticize a committee which we
feel has too much to do. The integrity of the members of
this year’s EC is beyond question as far as we’re con-
cerned—it is the approach which some of its members
have been taking on several debatable issues that we do

question.

John Updike, Rabbit, Run. (Crest

Reviewed by BERT PHILLIPS

Looking at Rabbit, Run after hav-
ing been away from it for some time,
I first recalled the image of a rath-
er stupid, washed-out basketball
player in bed with an ugly, pudgy
whore. In another image, I could
see the same man in a second-hand
car, zooming into the winter night,
listening to every rock ’n roll song
popular in 1960; more interested in
Connie Francis, Duane Eddy, and
“Stagger Lee” than his pregnant
wife and young son whom he had
deserted.

Too Much Ado

I also recollected a friend’s remark
that the individuals involved in the
lengthy sex scenes in Rabbit, Run
seemed to feel only animal pleasures,
and that there was no spiritual in-
volvement whatsoever. I finally re-
called a remark Updike made about
Salinger’s Franny and Zooey: “It is
just too much verbal ado about not
quite enough.” My reaction was that
people who live in glass houses
shouldn’t throw stones.

John Updike has bared the mind,
heart and soul of a disjointed sim-
pleton—Harry (Rabbit) Angstrom.
Rabbit’s one claim to fame was his
high school basketball career at a
small town Pennsylvania high school.

lofty position as a door-to-door
salesman of a useless kitchen gad-
get). Rabbit also is obsessed by sex-
ual intercorse.

For a time, Rabbit’s wife, Janice,
is equal to his obsession. She was his
high school sweetheart; after their
marriage she began to drink heavily
and to watch the “Mickey Mouse
Club.” There is one child in the
marriage, with another on the way.
One day Rabbit becomes unbear-
ably repulsed by and bored with his
situation as father, lover, and Mag-
ipeel salesman, so he takes off. He
turns first to his old coach, Tothero
(a stab by Updike at the “dear
coach” image) through whom Rab-
bit meets Ruth, an _ unattractive,
lardy lady, who slowly but surely
becomes a prostitute.

The first night Rabbit pays; but
from then on, he and Ruth just live
together. She pretends to be nothing
she is not, realizing that Rabbit is
no great prize, but that neither is
she .Everything is fine until a young,
ineffectual Episcopal minister ap-
pears and convinces Rabbit that his
desertion is morally wrong.

Tragedy Strikes

When Rabbit returns to his wife,
just as she is having their second
child, tragedy is just around the
corner. After the event, Rabbit
leaves home for good, attempts in
vain to go back to Ruth, whom he
discovers is pregnant and consider-
ing abortion; Ruth, contemptuous of

the confused Rabbit, will have noth-
ing to do with him.

The whole tissue of Rabbit's life
offers him nothing, and he offers
nothing in return. Painfully accept-
ing this, he performs one of the few
creditable acts of his life; he becomes
true to himself and takes off for
good. He runs, and Updike seems to
say he will run forever.

No Likable Characters

In trying to evaluate the book,
perhaps the first impression that one
gets is that Updike has written a
novel which does not contain a
single “likable” person. Our distaste
for the characters can be explained
by the fact that they are all too
weak, too “average,” and especially
in Rabbit and Janice’s case, too
stupid. Updike’s description of the
final tragedy which compels Rabbit
to leave home for good is almost un-
bearable. One can feel the author’s
intense hate of human stupidity in
the reading of this passage.

At times Updike seems to write at
his characters, challenging them to
face their situations and do someth-
ing about it. The trouble is, and Up-
dike is in fact telling us, that there
are no answers for Rabbit and the
others, that their problems are
brought to them by the state of
America today. Rabbit may run, but
where? Although Updike never
comes out and declares that these
people are representative of Mr. and

Political Horizons

 

Liberal Supports Kennedy ‘Rights’ Bill,
Defends Public Accomodations Section

By LAMAR LAMB

This article is an attempt to show the liberal point of
view on the currently debated Civil Rights Bill.

One of the primary criticisms leveled at the bill from
certain camps is that the monstrous federal government,
in an attempt to insure equal rights for all citizens, might
be overstepping its legal bounds. Voting rights, it is
pointed out, are specifically an area of state power as
is stated in Article I of the Constitution.

This is true enough, but if one reads further in the
Constitution to the 14th Amendment, it will be dis-
covered that this amendment provides that no state
shall deny to any person the equal protection of laws.
In the light of their argument, those who make the
“voting rights” criticism of the Civil Rights Bill no doubt
oppose that amendment to the Constitution which allows
women to vote.

In an area where states were obviously, even openly
discriminating against certain groups of their citizens,
the federal government has had to move in to protect
individual rights—surely something conservatives should
favor. I agree, it is regrettable that such action is neces-
sary, but that it is necessary there can be no doubt.
And, that the federal government has the legal right to
to do so, there can also be no doubt.

In regards to the Public Accommodations section of
the Civil Rights Bill, grave doubts as to the legality of
the proposed legislation are often expressed. In questions
of constitutionality such as these, one must look to just
what the Supreme Court would decide were a case
brought to them. There can be little doubt that were
the Supreme Court to hear such a case, it would rule
Congress completely within its power in passing this
legislation.

Interestingly enough, however, opponents of the bill
make no mention of the Supreme Court or any previous
decisions, they instead content themselves with what
they consider specific loopholes in the Administration’s
justification for the law. Their criticism can, I think, be
refuted were there sufficient time, space, and patience,
but that is really not needed. Congress would obviously
be completely within its rights to pass such a bill be-
cause of the Commerce Clause of the Constitution which

authorizes Congress to regulate commerce among the
several states.

There can can be little doubt that the public ac-
commodations section of the bill applies only to those
businesses which actively engage in inter-state com-
merce in that they buy and sell across state lines, and
openly encourage business with inter-state travelers.

But according to the old maximum, great issues are
seldom discussed in the light of the real principles in-
volved. This must certainly be true of the civil rights
legislation of this and previous years. Opposers to the
bill state that they do not defend racial discrimination,
merely individual liberty, i.e., the right to discriminate.

Of course, in light of the present situation they are in
fact defending racial discrimination whether they want
to admit it or not. This right to discriminate is based
on title property, something they evidently consider
the ultimate value in our society. If title property were
the only principle with which our government concerned
itself, then they might be justified in their argument.

But, fortunately, that is not the only prinicple in-
volved, else the right of eminent domain would also be
unconstitutional. Another principle our government con-
cerns itself with is that all men are created equal and as
such cannot legally be discriminated against.

It is interesting to speculate just which individual’s
liberty conservatives concern themselves with. It is ob-
viously the bigoted property owners. Naturally it is true
that anyone has a legal right to hold just about any
conceivable bias he wants, but right to act on that bias
stops when it interferes with another man’s freedom.

This is, I submit, the real issue at stake: it is not
some desperate clinging to the straws of justification for
hate, a justification of ends by means, but rather whether
a person can allow his prejudice to restrict his neighbor’s
freedom.

Let those people who are concerned with individual
liberty consider whether a citizen of this country should,
among other things, have an equal opportunity to vote,
or have the liberty to eat and sleep on an extended trip.
When they do that, they will favor the passing of the
Civil Rights Bill.

‘Specialization’
Limits Students

By GARETH ADEN

Last week a statement was made
in one of my classes which startled
me. It concerns something which
should be worthy the consideration
of any college student.

It was remarked that there was
little common ground any more be-
tween the man of the humanties and
the man of science. I feel, especially
after a year and a half here, that
there is a good deal of truth in
this statement. Furthermore I feel
this lack of common ground be-
tween the arts and the sciences is
due more to a fallacy in current edu-
cational theory than anything else.

Too Much Specialization

It appears that the idea of special-
ization in undergraduate school has
become overly stressed. No one lets
the student forget that he is living in
the Age of Science, more specifically,
the Age of Specialization. I would
not really deny the scientific age, nor
would I deny the need for special-
ized men in a complex world. What
I would question, though is the time
when a man should begin to special-
ize—the difference being the mere
margin between a “man” and a
“machine.”

Modern educational theory and
the “Race for Space” seem to have
panicked the college undergraduate
into the belief that if he doesn’t
learn everyaring about his chosen
field as a nundergraduate, he will be
left at the gate by the man who has
specialized. This is ridiculous.

Stress on Graduate Work

Fifteen years ago this concept
might have been a little nearer the
truth than it is today. Then fewer
people went to graduate school and
thus they had to rely more on their
undergraduate education for a job.
Today no one who is going into a
truly specialized field can do with-
out graduate school; therefore, what
today’s students are doing by nar-
rowing their field of interest before
graduation is simply the act of de-
priving themselves of a true educa-
tion,

No successful doctor, lawyer, or
scientist will stand by the idea of
complete specialization in college.
Most of these professional men will,
on the contrary, urge as much diver-
sification in undergraduate work as
graduate school requirements will
allow. The reason for this is quite
simple: these men understand the
value of a liberal education which
makes for a broad mind instead of
a narrow one. They know that a
doctor who can carry on an intel-
ligent conversation about something
other than medicine or write a pre-
sentable letter will be more success-
ful than a court lawyer who knows
nothing about psychology.

Diversification Is Goal

Looking at the question from a
more theoretical point of view, what
good is education that limits the
capabilities of the mind? College
curricula have so much to offer
that it is a waste to see a student
obtain knowledge in only one sub-
ject. The tendency among students
has been more and more to use elec-
tives in the field of their specialty,
where they feel comfortably “most
at home.” Such action boils down
to irrationally building walls around
oneself. History has always seen the
well-rounded individual rise above
the others simply because he can
draw from many fields the knowl-
edge and skills to attack his specific
problem.

Undergraduate education should
therefore be basically a prepara-
tion for specialization and not spec-
ialization itself. A certain amount of
focus in one’s schedule is admittedly
good and necessary, but at the
present this “focus” is being over-
played. This is why the humanities
and the sciences are finding it in-
creasingly difficult to communicate
with one another. Their scope is no
longer broad enough to stretch into
fields other than their own,

System Needs Change

This inability of the man of sci-
ense to speak meaningfully to the
man of the humanities has already
made its claim as one of the most
pressing problems of our time. One
field needs to be tempered by the
other and is bound to become dan-
gerous or meaningless if inter-com-
munication is impossible. Education
can solve this problem by putting
undergraduate college education
back on its original footing of diver-
sification rather than specialization.

Four returning three-year veter-
ans and a bumper crop of under-
classmen give Washington and Lee’s
basketball Generals a good chance
of recording their first winning sea-
son in recent campaigns this year.

W&L’s success, however, depends
on how well the Generals realize the
considerable potential they have ex-
hibited in past seasons. All four of
the veteran mainstays—guards Don

ingston, with freshman Jeff Twardy
also in the running for the position.

Three of the veterans are seniors.
Wallis, a 5-9 guard, has been the
leading playmaker for the Generals
in practice scrimmages and should
bolster the offensive attack with his
long jump shots and driving lay-ups.
A native of Indiana, he transferred
to W&L as a sophomore and has
been a regular since. Forward Su-
pack, 6-2, also a transfer, is consid-
ered one of the best drivers in area
small college basketball. He also
commands an accurate jump shot
and can play both forward and guard
positions. Martin, the team’s third
senior, is at 6-5 its leading rebound-

 

Tarheels, 16-14.

In the first match for both teams, the University of North

Carolina took an early lead and
9-1 in the 157-pound class last year,*
pinned the visitor’s Bill Woodall
midway through the final period to
give the Generals a 13-8 lead.
Jansen then decisioned UNC’s
Elliott Dorwin, 5-2, in the 167-pound
contest to give the Minks a com-
manding 16-8 advantage with only
two matches remaining. General
captain, Herb Smith, then lost a
hard-fought match in the 177 class,
8-5, to make the overall score 16-11.
Smith seemed to tire in the third
and final period of his match as he
battled a much heavier opponent.
Musick was very impressive in his
first match at W&L as he pinned his

foe in 2:40 of the first period. This
put the Generals ahead, 5-3, after
freshman Bruce Builder lost the
initial contest of the evening to

was pinned by North Carolina grap-

ODC Beats Cagers, 86-63
Spessard and Wallis Lead;
Initial Home Tilt Tonight

The W&L basketball team started
its season on a sour note as it suc-
cumed to Old Dominion Saturday on
the winner’s home court, 86-63. The
Monarchs piled up an early lead and
then sent in the reserves as they
coasted to victory.

Tonight the Generals are host to
Bridgewater at 8:00 for their first
home contest of the season. Bridge-
water has its best team in several
seasons as demonstrated by its con-
vincing win of Randolph-Macon last
week. Macon had the best team in
the state last year and has most of its
men returning this year.

The Generals got into foul
troubles early in the first half of
their losing cause with the Monarchs
shooting “one and one” on the free-
throw line with only five minutes
gone in the game. ODC took advant-
age of this break by hitting on 22 of
29 charity tosses, while the Minks
could only sink 21 of 35 foul shots.

The high scorers for the winners
were Randy Leddy with 16, Wayne
Parks with 14, Ronnie Byrd with 12
and Jerry Nichols with 10. The
Blue and White were paced by Bob
Spessard with 12 and Don Wallis
with 10 points. The Generals made
21 of 58 shots from the floor for a
poor average of 36 per cent.

 

picking David and Crenshaw.

David is well-known for his pass
receiving and alert pass defense and
was so impressive this season that
McLaughlin has hinted at opening
up the General offense next year to
take full advantage of this halfback’s
amazing hands.

The 5-10, 180-pounder KA, a na-
tive of Harwinton, Connecticut led
the College Athletic Conference in
pass reception with 20 grabs good
for 222 yards and 4 TDs. David also
led the team and was among the
conference leaders with 5 intercep-
tions for 30 yards and was a feared
punt return specialist.

Chenshaw, who depends more on
his ferocious running and fine back-
field blocking, is a 5-8, 178-pound
Delt from Henderson, N. Y. He saw
only limited action this season, but
was very impressive when operating
at full capacity. McLaughlin stated
that “even though injuries kept
Crenshaw sidelined much of the
year, the boys recognized his leader-
ship ability.”

It was also felt that Crenshaw’s
hard running would give the Gen-
erals another steady ground game
from the halfback position that
Yoffe vacated, the new co-captain’s
rushing average of 4.7 yards-per-
carry this season supports this pre-
diction.

Tom Supak and center Howard Mar-
tin—were frequent double-figure
scorers last season but seemed un-
able to group their efforts consistent-
ly and as a result Washington and
Lee finished with a disappointing 6-
13 record.

Coach Bob McHenry is expected
to rely on this quartet as a nucleus
of the Generals’ starting team. The
fifth starter is likely to be Fred
Mindel, Steve Sweitzer or Dick Liv-

 

siderable production. Both Supak
and Martin hail from the Norfolk-
Virginia Beach area.

Junior Lou Paterno broke into the
Washington and Lee line up as a
freshman. He is probably the stead-
iest performer on the team and re-
lies heavily on a deadly jumper for
his points. Paterno is a shade under
6-0, plays both guard and ocassional-
ly forward, and lives in South

*TIS THE SEASON TO BE JOLLY

If you have been reading this column—and I hope you have; I
mean I genuinely hope so; I mean it does not profit me one
penny whether you read this column or not; I mean I am paid
every week by the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes and my
emolument is not affected in any way by the number of people
who read or fail to read this column—an act of generosity
perfectly characteristic of the makers of Marlboro, you would
say if you knew them as I do; I mean here are tobacconists gray
at the temples and full of honors who approach their art as
eagerly, as dewy-eyed as the youngest of practitioners; I mean
the purpose of the Marlboro makers is simply to put the best of
all possible filters behind the best of all possible tobaccos and
then go, heads high, into the market place with their wares,
confident that the inborn sense of right and wrong, of good and
bad, of worthy and unworthy, which is the natural instinct of
every American, will result in a modest return to themselves
for their long hours and dedicated labors—not, let me hasten to
add, that money is of first importance to the makers of Marlboro;
all these simple men require is plain, wholesome food, plenty of
Marlboros, and the knowledge that they have scattered a bit of
sunshine into the lives of smokers everywhere; if, I say, you
have been reading this column, you may remember that last
week we started to discuss Christmas gifts.

1o Wo Wow Someone whe t3itheresfed te Americar History?

We agreed, of course, to give cartons of Marlboro to all our
friends and also to as many total strangers as possible. Today
let us look into some other welcome gifts.

Do you know someone who is interested in American history?
If so, he will surely appreciate a statuette of Millard Fillmore
with a clock in the stomach. (Mr. Fillmore, incidentally, was
the only American president with a clock in the stomach.
James K. Polk had a stem-winder in his head, and William
Henry Harrison chimed the quarter-hour, but only Mr. Fillmore,
of all our chief executives, had a clock in the stomach. Franklin
Pierce had a sweep second hand and Zachary Taylor had
seventeen jewels, but, I repeat, Mr. Fillmore and Mr. Fillmore
alone had a clock in the stomach. Some say that Mr. Fillmore
was also the first president with power steering, but most
historians assign this distinction to Chester A. Arthur. How-

ever, it has been established beyond doubt that Mr. Fillmore
was the first president with a thermostat. Small wonder they
called him Old Hickory!)

But I digress. To get back to weleome and unusual Christmas
gifts, here’s one that’s sure to please—a gift certificate from the
Ameriean Chiropractic Society. Accompanying each certificate
is this winsome little poem:

Merry Christmas, Happy New Year,
Joyous sacro-iliac!

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Producer Is Praised For Movie

(Continued from page 2)

Weld are several of the most beau-
tiful scenes of this year.

Gleason wants something from
supplies, McQueen gives it to him.
McQueen is harassed and bullied
by the M.P.’s, so Gleason beats
hell out of them. They have only
one running disagreement. Mc-
Queen wants to get out of the
Army, and with Gleason, make a
million dollars. Gleason has found
a home in the army, and refuses
to leave. The manner in which this
problem is resolved results in a
beautiful and poignant scene.

William Goldman wrote the novel
and much credit must be given to
him. Nearly as much may be given
to Blake Edwards who adapted the
novel to the screen. Edwards has se-
lected his scenes carefully and de-
pended upon his talented actors to
bring out the full meaning of Gold-
man’s book. Ralph Nelson, the di-
rector, has seen to it that the actors
did accomplish what was expected of
them. He has cut what might have
been extraneous filler. He has pared
the film down so that each sequence
is essential to the whole.

Criticism of the film will be that
it is disjointed, that it lacks depth,
exposition, and motivation. When
first viewing it, the film will seem
disjointed; but it seems so in a re-
markable and pleasing way. And
later, in retrospect, the film be-
comes a carefully, tightly con-
structed film. Its seeming disjoint-
edness becomes actually well-con-
sidered and is one of the film’s
major virtues. As to its lacking
depth and exposition, that is simp-
ly up to the individual viewer.
Although the film is not a 1, 2, 3,
4, 5 progression, it is 1, 3, 5. Nel-
son allows one to fill in for
himself, he asks one to judge

wether what Nelson is show-
ing us is both probable and real,
and rather than insist that he give
simple explanations for everything,
he asks one to accept what he pre-
sents and evaluate it as it is,

I believe he is justified in all this,
and I believe he has succeeded ad-
mirably. “Solder in the Rain” is the
finest American film I have seen this
year and gives one a little more
faith in the American cinema.

 

Updike’s Rabbit, Run Has

‘No Likable Characters’
(Continued from page 2)

Mrs. Average American, 1960, he
obviously intends that Rabbit’s story
is to be read as Everyman’s story.
Another complaint which many
have made about the novel is that
Updike goes beyond the line of
“good taste,” that Rabbit, Run, is
entirely too vulgar. One critic re-
marks that parts of the novel “out
Molly Bloome’s Molly Bloome.”
What can one say to this except to
reply that sex cannot be honestly
described as beautiful if it does
not seem beautiful to those involved.
But perhaps the ultimate weak-
ness of the book is Rabbit’s own.
There are few men, no matter how
desperate, who are as lacking of
inner resources. Rabbit, Run would
have been a bigger book if Rabbit
had been a bigger man.

wild and woolly, decision to the Tar-

three points gained were not enough |
however, for UNC, who needed the
five for a pin to give them a tie in
the match, and Washington and Lee
scored their first win of the 1963-64
wrestling season.

JV Wrestlers Lose Close Match

The Washington and Lee junior
varsity wrestling team lost a close
contest to North Carolina’s frosh
Saturday, 19-15, in a prelim to the
varsity match between these same
two schools.

It took until the final match, the
unlimited division, before the win-
ner of the match could be de-
termined when General Tom Cren-
shaw got trapped and pinned by
UNC’s Bill Johnson to give the
Baby Tarheels the victory.

The Generals came from behind
and with pins by Kemble White,
Jamie Andrew, and Jim Tyler, took
the lead 15-14, before the final
heavyweight match. Along with

Crenshaw, the other General grap-
plers who lost hard-fought decisions
were Butch West, Graeme Banner-
man, and Duncan LaMonte.

Leadership Qualities:
Topic Of Gaines’ Talk

“Credentials for Leader-
ship” will be the topic of Dr.
Francis Pendleton Gaines’

speech at the 49th Annual
ODK Tap Day Assembly. Don

Partington, president of Wash-
ington and Lee’s ODK chapter, has
announced that the assembly will be
held on December 17 at 12 o’clock
noon in Doremus Gymnasium. A
banquet for both old and newly-
tapped members will be held in
Evans Hall following the address by
the Chancellor of the University.

Dr. Gaines, noted as one of the
South’s greatest orators, received his
AB. degree from the University of
Richmond, his A.M. from the Uni-
versity of Chicago, his Ph.D. from
Columbia, and his Litt.D. from Duke
and Columbia. In 1930 he accepted
the presidency of Washington and
Lee and held that office until 1959.
Upon his retirement he was made
Chancellor of the University. In ad-
dition, he has received honorary
degrees from the following schools:
Baylor, Furman, Mercer, Richmond,
Wake Forest, William Jewell, Se-
wanee, University of Chattanooga,
University of North Carolina,
Waynesburg College, Hampden-Syd-
ney, Rollins, and Washington and
Lee.

An ODK member himself, Dr.
Gaines has served as president of
the Woodrow Wilson Birthplace
Foundation, director of the George
C. Marshall Foundation, and presi-
dent of the Cooperative Education
Association of Virginia. He is also
the author of three books, The
Southern Plantation, Lee—The Final
Achievement and Southern Oratory.

Forty-Ninth Assembly

The assembly will be the forty-

ninth in which ODK taps new mem-

bers from the student body, the
faculty, and the alumni. New mem-
bers are selected by old members

on the basis of leadership and cit-
izenship in various aspects of uni-
versity life, and all student members
must be in the upper 35 per cent
of their class in scholastic standing.
Goals of ODK

Omicron Delta Kappa is an honor-
ary leadership fraternity founded at
Washington and Lee in 1914 for the
purpose ol together cam-

“bringing

pus leaders in a more relaxed at-

leges and universities

‘CoP Speaker
Sponsored Here
By Convention

The chairman of the Draft Gold-
water drive in the South will speak
at Washington and Lee Monday
night under the sponsorship of the
Mock Republican Convention.

John E. Grenier, a Birmingham
attorney who is chairman of the
Alabama Republican Party as well
as being one of the top men in the
Goldwater drive, will appear in du-
Pont Auditorium at 8:00 p.m. He will
talk on the Republican Party in
the South and on the role of young
professional men such as himself in
reviving the southern GOP.

Grenier has earned a reputation
as one of the most effective of the

}] young Republican politicians who are

bucking Democrats in the Solid
The National Observer said
of him last month that “more than

‘| any other man, he has brought Ala-

bama to the brink of two-party

|| Grenier’s

talk is the first of a
series of events planned by the Mock

Convention Steering Committee to

prepare the student body for effec-
tive participation in the spring con-
vention. Although Grenier is one of
the most important members of the
committee to draft Senator Gold-
water ,his talk will be non-partisan
as concerns the candidacy.

Announce Appointments

Eight students have been ap-
pointed to administration jobs in the
Mock Convention. Jim Rowe, assist-
ant chairman of the convention and
director of finances, named Don
Huffman and John Huss as co-
chairmen of the finance committee.
Huss, who is charged with national
fund-raising for the convention, is
also Treasurer for the convention.
Huffman is responsible for fund-
raising at the local level.

nounced the appointment of three

It is the responsibility of each student to know the time and place of

meeting of each of his examinations.

The hours for examinations are 9:00-

12:00 and 2:00-5:00. Any student more than five minutes late must present
a satisfactory reason for his lateness to be allowed to take the examina-

tion.

The omission by a student of any regular examination causes him to for-
feit his place in the class and to receive grade F for the semester, unless he

The dance will begin at nine p.m.

Croft stated that the gospel-singers
will perform around 11 o’clock.
“While adding color to the theme of
the ball,” Croft remarked, “the
scheduling of both the band and
the gospel-singers should provide an
appealing variety in the entertain-

Stan Rubin’s Dixieland section, the
“Tiger Town Five,” will back the

The Fund is directed by the Parents’

nual appeal to all parents of students
for support. In Mr. Holden’s letter to
the parents he states in part, “I am

been instrumental in popularizing
gospel-singing. Originating in Phila-

formed in nightclubs throughout the
eastern seaboard.

In commenting on this new musi-
cal trend, Croft stated that “since
folk-singing is starting on the de-
cline, gospel-singing has begun to
emerge as a sign of a new taste in
popular music. According to critics,
this type of music will continue gain-
ing a wide and popular appeal in the
near future.”

In defining popular gospel-singing,

 

Time stated: “It’s a little bit of rhy-
thm and blues, a little bit of soul
jazz, and a lot of oldtime religion.”

Favorably reviewed in magazines
such as Down Beat and Playboy,
gospel music is commonly played
in the Newport Jazz Festivals and
the Hootenanny shows. It combines
somewhat jazz and rock and roll, and
among the former gospel-singers are
celebrities such as James Brown,
Ray Charles, and The Shirelles.

The concert was instituted after
the success of the midnight concert
at last year’s Ball by Stan Ruben’s
Tigertown Five.

William Humphrey, Washington
and Lee’s writer-in-residence, spoke
in Lee Chapel Wednesday night on
| “Flaubert and Tolstoy: Carthage and
Moscow.”

Humphrey, who is the Glasgow
| Visiting Professor for the Fall term,
| begon his talk with a general con-
| demination of what he termed “hy-
phenated novels,” that is, works such
as historical novels and_ political
novels. These, he claimed, are detri-
mental to history as well as to fic-
tion, because of an idealization of
characters and events of the past
which not only causes an unobjective
view of history, but often tends to
overshadow the literary value of the
work.
“Looking Backward”

Humphrey stated that good writers
such as Hemingway, Melville, Balzac,
and Conrad, as well as bad writers,
have been guilty of “looking back-
ward” into history to find character-
istics which they believed lacking
in their own times.

The talk centered on two histori-
cal novels, Flaubert’s Salammbo and
Tolstoy’s War and Peace. The for-

 

mer is a typically unsuccessful his-

 

Is the Assimilation Committee
necessary for the preservation of
conventional dress? Is it carrying
out its function effectively?

The newly formed Student Lead-
ership Forum included these points
in its discussion of the problems of
conventional dress and the role of
the Assimilation Committee. The
Forum chose this topic for debate as
the result of a letter appearing in
the Ring-tum Phi advocating the
abolishment of the Assimilation
Committee.

Held in conjunction with a sup-
per, the discussion took place in the
Letitia Pate Evans Dining Hall in
the first meeting of the Forum since
its formation on October 9.

Senior Jud Reis,
Leadership Forum, moderated the
meeting. Reis announced that the
voting on the recently written pro-
posed constitution for the Forum
would be postponed.

The discussion was initiated by
two brief speeches giving opposing
viewpoints on the Assimilation Com-

Historical Novels Panned
For Idealizing Past Glory

torical novel, and the
uniquely successful one.
The reason for Flaubert’s failure,
Humphrey pointed out, was his mo-
tive for returning to the past. The
French novelist was in search of a
time when people had an energy and
passion which Flaubert believed his
contemporaries to lack. On his por-
trayal of ancient Carthage, which is
the setting for Salammbo, Flaubert
made the unfortunate error of letting
his own decor swamp the drama of
the novel. The result was a book of
idealized and unreal characters.

Sought Universal Truth

Tolstoy, in contrast to Flaubert,
turned to history to find universal
truth. War and Peace was written
with the idea that the greater the
man in history, the further he is
removed from it. The description of
French soldiers in the chaos in the
batlefield, without the guidance of
generals, is analogous to Tolstoy’s
idea that history moves impervious
to great men. This historical argu-
ment, Humphrey stated, released the
creativity in the novel.

Heroics, which are a great fault
of most historical novels, are not
present in War and Peace, since
Tolstoy despised glory and denied it
to the past. The conclusion of the
novel, which sets it apart from
other historical novels, is that men
are essentially the same now as they
have been in the past.

Clearing Up Some Misgivings

The debate over the Assimilation Committee at the Univer-
sity Leadership Conference last Tuesday is indicative of the
rising concern over W&L’s conventional dress. We, therefore,
feel this to be an opportune time to clear up some of the mis-

givings that a number of students might have toward this issue.
We hope that the following may shed some light.

IS CONVENTIONAL DRESS A RULE OR A

TRADITION?

Students argue that if conventional dress is a rule, it should
be explicitly defined and the specific provisions be made public
to the student body. If, on the other hand, it is a tradition,
it should not be externally imposed in any manner; adherence
to it should be spontaneous and voluntary.

We feel, however, that the issue should not be presented
in such black and white terms, that conventional dress is some-

where between a “rule” and a ‘

‘tradition.” Just to give it some

category, we shall state that conventional dress is a mutually-
agreed-upon practice, the perpetuation of which is insured
through a mutually-agreed-upon means of enforcement.

HOW IS CONVENTIONAL DRESS ENFORCED?

By the students themselves. They alone have the power of
enforcement; contrary to popular belief, the Assimilation
Committee is simply a medium by which this power can oper-
ate. For it is the individual student who brings up the charge
against a presumed violator; the Assimilation Committee acts
only as the intermediary body between the accused and the
accuser to see that the charge is valid and is equitably handled.

SHOULDN’T WE DEFINE CONVENTIONAL DRESS?

To define conventional dress with its innumerable excep-
tions would be virtually impossible, and would at the same time
destroy the spirit under which the practice has traditionally
been fostered. However, we do need some qualifications to
the statement that ‘“‘conventional dress is required at all times
on University property and within the town of Lexington.”
We should certainly qualify “at all times.”

WHEN SHOULD WE PERMIT EXCEPTIONS?

To answer this question, we must first examine the pur-
pose of conventional dress. The principle behind it is that
good appearance is one of the ways a student can help promote
a favorable reflection of his University. It is assumed for this
reason that conventional dress will be observed at all times,
except when it is inappropriate to do so. For example, a stu-
dent is not expected to wear a coat and tie on his way to the gym
for a workout. The same is true for students driving out of
town to Goshen, etc. This matter of appropriateness is left
up to the sincere judgment of the student.

IS CONVENTIONAL DRESS WORTH KEEPING?

As it was brought out at the Leadership Conference, con-
ventional dress has been a basic part of the W&L personality.
Even more significant, it is a part of our personality which has
been widely praised, and in turn provides an added source of
pride in our University. This observation is confirmed con-
stantly by the compliments and recognition we receive from
visitors and students’ parents. In this and many other ways,
the continuance of conventional dress has been justified over
and over again, and any way that we can insure its preservation
merits our full consideration and endorsement.

 

 

| Letters To The Editor...

 

 

Mr. Lamar Lamb
Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
Sir:

A few random notes and observa-
tions on your sloppy “attempt to
show the liberal point of view on
the currently debated Civil Rights
Bill.”

It is interesting to note in passing
that you use “there is no doubt” or
some variant assertion several times
in your article. Less of this ex
cathedra dagmatism and more calm
logic would have served you better.

(1) You say “if one (presumably
meaning one of us “bigoted property
owners” who oppose the bill?) “reads
further in the Constitution,” he will
“discover” the equal protection
clause. If you read further, you
would “discover” the equal protec-
tion clause applies to existing laws,
not as a justification for further
legislation.

(2) Your suggestion “those who
make the ‘voting rights’ criticism”
of the bill might also oppose woman
suffrage is rather cute. I might point
out that this amendment was en-
acted through the constitutionally
provided process; the states thus ob-
viously acquiesced in ceding that
area of voting rights—but as yet, no
other—to the federal government.

(3) You assert the federal gov-
ernment has had to move in to pro-
tect individual rights. Not so. Ad-
mittedly, where existing and ade-
quate state voting laws are dis-
criminatorily enforced, those dis-

 

criminated against have legitimate
recourse to federal courts. This,
however, is a separate matter from
new federal legislation.

(4) You say “one must look to just
what the Supreme Court would (my
emphasis) decide....” This test of
constitutionality is, as far as I know,
unique Anglo-American jurispru-
dence. A few—nay, most—in fact,
all—constitutional law authorities
would say you look instead to what
the Court has decided. In a word, our
system is one of precedent, not pre-
diction.

(5) You say opponents of the bill
are “defending racial discrimination
whether they want to admit it or
not.” Not so. I oppose the bill, and
I strenuously condemn, personally,
racial discrimination. Just as strenu-
ously, however, I defend the right
of every citizen, of whatever color,
to be free from laws saying he can-
not, in his private life, discriminate.

(6) You accuse conservatives of
concerning themselves only with the
liberty of “bigoted property own-
ers.” I’m not sure what you have
against the concept of private prop-
erty, engrained in our legal system
through 800 years of development.
But I must admonish you to reflect
how much “human rights” (the fav-
orite fetish of the left) would be
worth without the right to own and
control private property.

Solid South For Goldwater Concept Gone;
All Bets Are Off For Confused Republicans

By STEVE SMITH

Last year at this time Nelson

but what is certain is that the Re-

from an apparent Goldwater land-

The accession of President Johnson
is tearing into the Goldwater cam-
paign just as events essentially re-
moved from politics, divorce and re-
marriage, earlier tore into the Rocke-

are momentarily bewildered, and

Montgomery Questions W&L Democracy;
Advocates Formation Of Student Senate

(The following does not neces-
sarily represent the editorial posi-
tion of this paper. Editor)

By WARREN MONTGOMERY
Associate Editor

What do you think about such im-
portant student matters as conven-
tional dress, school
supported dances,
the honor system,
» cuts, and_ school
control over fra-
ternities? Actual-
ly it does not mat-
ter what you think
| about these issues,
or any others. De-
fm cisions on all

" student affairs are
made by a mere
ney handful of people.

Do you think that our student
government operates on a system of
democracy? If so, you are wrong...
unless you think “democracy” is be-
ing told once a year by your fra-
ternity or group to vote for a series
of candidates who will have abso-
lute control over you for the next
year.

 

Minority Rule

Are you content to remain impas-
sive to whatever decisions are made
for you or to continue to be im-
potent, irrelevant, and useless in the
government of the body of which
you are an equal member? Are you
satisfied to let the ruling junta keep
secret from you the proceedings
which affect you the most and to
allow it the power of censorship
over the student press? If you are
not, then part of the Tuesday edi-
tion’s revealing and forthright edi-
torial might interest you. “...we
have reason to believe that a small
minority of that small minority
called the EC is running our stu-
dent government. We would like to
see a Student Senate with a veto
power over the EC...”

A student senate is not a revo-
lutionary, new, or untried idea. On
a great many American campuses,
it is the established form of student
government. Most student bodies
will not put up with an elective oli-
garchy, which is an apt description
of the Executive Committee.

Benefits of Student Senate

What would be the benefits of a
W&L Student Senate? Obviously,
and most important, it would let
each individual member of the stu-
dent body have some influence in his
school government. the W&L stu-
dent is an intelligent and thoughtful
person, certainly capable of taking
part in the direction of his own af-
fairs. Why then should the student
government be dictated by a cabal
of people no more capable than he?

Next, a student senate would do
much to clean up our eynical and
corrupt campus politics. As it is now,
a party can gain influence only if

 

its fraternities present a solid front—
which means that the individual
member is faced with voting party
despite his own feelings or betraying
his fraternity. With a student legis-
lature, however, the entire political
scene would no longer be a matter
of the election of party candidates—
each fraternity would have an equal
influence on student questions and
would not have to grasp and claw
for power through election of frater-
nity brothers.

Eliminate Inaction

A student congress would elimi-
nate the inaction and procrastination
so often exhibited by the EC. In a
student congress, any representa-
tive could bring an issue up for a
decision at any time, and a definite
ruling would be made then and
there.

Finally, a student senate would
help nullify much of the bitterness
felt by many students toward what
they consider, rightfully, an archaic,
reactionary, and oppressive school
government. A student who is fairly
represented has no grounds for com-
plaint on how the school is run.

Why Not?

Why shouldn’t we have a senate?
“Well, for one thing,” the typical
complacent, apathetic, steady-as-
you-goer might say, “we have de-
mocracy here because we get to
choose our leaders according to their
beliefs.” Not at all. We have a choice
between two tickets which are cho-
sen by political manipulation within
small inter-fraternity cliques. The
student has no say on who is to run.
Furthermore, the two candidates,
can and usually do evade any real
problems and issues that might stir
up controversy. Our elections are
usually Tweedle-Dum and Tweedle-
Dee affairs, full of sound and fury,
signifying nothing. Also, once in, a
candidate does not have to do any-
thing, for he is utterly out of the
reach of the student body.

“But a student congress would be
a very complex thing to create and
operate,” says the indifferent stu-
dent. Wrong again. It could simply
be a monthly meeting of elected rep-
resentatives from each fraternity,
the Independent Union, and each
class. We could even turn the IFC
into a student senate, with slight
modification. All a senate would need
is power to initiate legislation, and
the right to approve all EC propo-
sals. Give these powers to the IFC,
and we have a student senate.

Methods of Reform

“Well,” admits the now thoroughly
convinced student, “a student senate
would be a great thing, but the EC
has complete authority over every-
thing. They don’t have to listen to

student demands unless they want
to, and they obviously don’t. What
can I do all by myself?”

In the first place, you can write

 

 

*

letters to the paper. The Ring-tum
Phi welcomes and prints almost all
the letters sent to it. Even EC
members must read the paper.

If the EC fails to see any signifi-
cance in letters, stronger measures
can be taken. Petitioning for a stu-
dent congress would surely give the
EC some inkling of what is going on.

And finally, if despite student
pressure, the EC still refuses to
budge from its authoritarian clutch
on the campus, students could cram
reform right down its throat. Any
organization, especially the IFC, could
draw up a new constitution and pre-
sent it to the student body for a
vote. Upon passage, such a constitu-
tion would be legally operative. The
EC derives its powers from the stu-

(Continued on page 4)

 

convention votes, now they may be
left holding the bag. The concept
of a solid South for Goldwater at
the Convention and in the electoral
college must be completely junked.
This is not to say that the Arizona
Senator is not still a strong candi-
date, but that his candidacy must
find a new base if it is to continue. It
is by no means certain that Gold-
water will even declare his candi-
dacy,, since the plan of defeating
Kennedy can’t work against Johnson.
Until the assassination it seemed that
1964 offered the perfect opportunity
for the conservatives to make a
showing; and Goldwater was the ob-
vious choice to contrast with the
New Frontier. Now that this contrast
has been somewhat blurred, will
Goldwater commit the conservatives
to the contest?

Against His Will

With a southerner in the White
House, the Goldwater South has col-
lapsed; with Kennedy gone, the
chance for the conservatives to win
a clear victory over the liberals is
gone. For Goldwater anything but a
decisive election victory over a
liberal champion, must be unsatis-
factory; and a contest between him-
self and Johnson doesn’t fill the bill
right now. Will Goldwater enter the
race under these changed circum-
stances? The answer is that he may
not like it, but that he may be forced
into it. The Draft Goldwater move-
ment has reached the point where
it is difficult for its supporters to
back out gracefully. If Goldwater re-
fuses to run he will not only disap-
point many people but he will an-
tagonize many others.

One reason Goldwater backers
couldn’t swallow a_ conservative
withdrawal, even a tactical one, is
that so many of them, are not
party professionals, but amateurs
who are in the game for the sole
purpose of electing the Arizona
senator. While this fact could
drag Goldwater into an unwilling
race, it has a happier aspect for
him if he makes a go of it. It en-
sures that he will retain his sup-
port even if the party strategists
decide that he can’t win. Gold-
water actually has grass roots
backing which won’t quit.

Amid all this speculation, Gold-
water has taken refuge for 15 days
in the Air Force Reserves for his
annual tour of service. He has stated
that he believes his support has re-
mained steady despite the change
in the White House, and commented
very favorably on President John-
son. His high estimation of Johnson
is indicative of Goldwater’s reluc-
tance to tangle with a man whom the

Call For ‘Pioneer Spirit’

said, “Many hard

Of planning...
our nation has just

to extend our

er field.” John

Kennedy had this
same sense of im-
mediate purpose
and Washington reflected an aura of
urgency in revitalizing American
politics and American life.

Kennedy’s dynamism was manifest
to a certain degree in the bills that
Congress passed during the 1961-1962
session including the area redevel-
opment act, public works accelera-
tion, increase of the minimum wage,
manpower training to give new
skills to the unemployed, expansion
of social security benefits, extension
of Civil Rights Commission, revision
of public welfare programs, housing

trol, and expanded college student

Thermadorian Reaction

Yet the second American Revolu-
tion which began with the New Deal
and which was being carried on by
the New Frontier, is having its Ther-
madorian reaction as expressed by
conservative Southern Democrats
and Goldwater Republicans. The
clear-cut needs of Roosevelt’s time
are perhaps not as clear, not as
striking. Thus many no longer feel
the necessity for a public-spirited
drive along the lines of economic

 

programing and _ social legislation.
Ask a conservative what he would
do with the problems in West Vir-
ginia. If he doesn’t say, “Sell it to
the Russians”; he’ll declare that a
group should go off in a corner to
study the situation.

Fortunately, such men as John
Kennedy, or labor leaders, or many
college professors recognize that we
are still working on the frontier to
the solution of complex social and
economic problems, and that it is a
frontier which we must approach
with a pioneer spirit; not with a
“Nobody gets something for nothing
in this world, Pal” attitude.

Actually, we have only to look
around us to see erying need for
action. The mental hospital at Staun-
ton is not very far removed from
the snake-pit hospitals that Charles
Dickens described on visiting the
U.S. in the 1800’s. The whole area
which relies mainly on one industry
and the unemployed who stand in
line behind the bus depot for their
dole of “commodity rations” is re-
flected in similar communities across
the country.

Need in Unemployment

And on a national scale, the un-
employment is hovering around 5.5
per cent of the total working popu-
lation and acording to Columbia
University’s Bureau of Applied So-
cial Research, “the rate of unem-
ployment will double by 1970 if the
imbalances of the fifties persist.”
Some of these imbalances are the
result of automation, a relatively re-
cent force that does not always op-
erate for the general welfare. The
rising national productivity, high
profit margins and lack of increased
consumer demand has led in many
cases to stagnation and unemploy-

Generals Win Two; Play Centre Saturday
Four Grid-Men Named to All-CAC Squad

B-Ballers Down Lynchburg, '58-54)

Edge Bridgewater 66-62 in Upset

By LES G

RANDIS

Tomorrow night the Generals risk their 2-1 record against
Centre College, one of the tallest teams in the College Athletic

Conference.

This past week has been one of close contests for the Gen-
erals. On Tuesday they edged Bridgewater 66-62, and yester-

day narrowly beat Lynchburg 58-54.*
In yesterday’s game, Washington
and Lee got off to a slow start and
at one time in the first half were
down 24-7. But they came alive to
close the gap to 34-27 at halftime.

Lynchburg just barely outshot
the Generals from the floor, hitting
13 of 29 to W&L’s 12 of 28.

The second half saw the Gener-
als pick up where they left off, con-
tinuing to close the gap. With
Lynchburg ahead 44-41 and 10 min-
utes on the clock, forward Dick
Livingston tossed in three straight
field goals to put Washington and
Lee ahead for the first time, 47-45.

Lynchburg tied it up, but for-
ward Steve Sweitzer dropped in five
straight points to put the Generals
ahead 52-47.

W&L scored again but with four
minutes left Lynchburg captain
Jimmy Jones put in two free throws
to tie it up.

For three minutes W&L tried to
set up one last shot, but Livings-
ton was fouled. With 0:53 remaining
he put in two free throws to put
W&L ahead for the last time.

Lynchburg got the ball, but quick-
ly lost it. In the remaining seconds
gaurds Lou Paterno and Don Wallis
were fouled, each making one free
throw to clinch the victory.

Paterno led the Generals in scor-
ing with 16 points, and in rebounds
with nine. Fred Mindel was next
with nine points, followed by Liv-
ingston with eight, and captain Tom
Supak and Sweitzer with seven.
Center Bob Spessard was second in
rebounds with eight.

In the second half the Generals
made 12 of 31 from the floor for an
overall percentage of 40.72.

Leading scorer for Lynchburg
was Jones with 14, followed by Clark
and Dave Layman with seven. Lay-
man was also Lynchburg’s leading
rebounder with ten.

Although the score was just as
close, W&L’s game against Bridge-
water Tuesday night did not have
the same excitement of a come-
from-behind win.

Throughout most of the game the
Generals were on top, getting off to
a quick start and a 37-32 halftime
lead. Bridgewater had just defeated

W&L Swimmers
Lose To UVa.

By TIM O'KEEFE

Although the W&L swimming
team lost 62-33 Wednesday to the
University of Virginia, coach Norris
Eastman said the Generals perform-
ed better than the score indicates.

“We did our best time ever in
the 400-yard medley relay, but Vir-
ginia won it anyway,” Eastman said.

UVa. won 10 of the 11 events, giv-
ing W&L its first defeat against one
victory.

The Generals will have a chance
to move ahead again tomorrow when
they go against Loyola College here
at 2:30 p.m.

“Our boys swam well, but the
Cavaliers just had too good a team
for us,’ Eastman said.

Eastman said Bill Broaddus prob-
ably gave the best performance of
the team in the 200-yard back-
stroke, but he came in second.

“We have a young team this year,
and it may very well turn out to be
one of the best we have had as far
as time goes. Unfortunately, the
score doesn’t always show this,”
Eastman said.

W&L took its only event in the
400-yard freestyle relay with a time
of 3:47.8. Steve Lester, Hal Chase,
Walt McManus and Bart Taylor
brought in the winning time for the
Generals.

At least one General placed in
all the events except for the medley
relay. McManus and John Wolfe
came in second and third in the 200-
yard freestyle while Blaire Brown
came in third in the 200-yard indi-
vidual medley.

Both Bart Taylor and Chase placed

I-M

By TOM WHITE

Top game of the week in basket-
ball found a tough Delt team up-
setting strong ZBT, 48-40. Both teams
had figured to be among the tops
in the league. Delt still must face
Sigma Chi, Law, and defending
champ SAE, who did not play this
week.

Favored Sigma Nu, last year’s sec-
ond place finishers, notched victory
number two of the season with a
35-24 victory over KA. Sigma Nu
figures to be one of the leading con-
tenders for SAE’s crown.

Beta beat Lambda Chi 45 to 23,
but, in their second game of the
week, Lambda Chi shot back with
47-23 victory over SPE. PEP’S hopes
for the season were dashed with two
losses... 35-23 to Phi Psi, and 43
to 31 to Phi Kappa Sig.

The best: 1. SAE, 1-0; 2. Sigma
Nu, 2-0; 3. Delt, 1-0. Top game of
next week: SAE against Law. Prob-
able winner: SAE.

In handball, defending champ Beta
picked up victory number two the
easy way...a forfeit win over NFU,
who also forfeited to Sigma Chi.
Strong Phi Delt downed Kappa Sig
and shut out Phi Phi, 5-0. PiKA top-
ped Phi Gam, while Law forfeited
for the second time to give KA the
victory.

No change apparent in this week’s
ratings. The best: 1. Beta, 2-0; 2.
Delt, 1-0; 3. PiKA, 2-0.

Defending champion Phi Kappa
Sig picked up victory number two
of the bowling season this week with
a win over PiKA. In the week’s
other matches DU won their first
match of the season as they downed
PEP, who now have a 0-3 record;
and Phi Delt also won their first
match as they tripped once beaten
Lambda Chi, 3-1.

The best: 1. Kappa Sig, 2-0; 2.
Phi Psi, 2-0; 3. Phi Kappa Sig, 2-0.

Last year’s champ, Phi Psi evened
their record at 1-1 by downing ZBT
in wrestling. Phi Phi forfeited their
second match of the season... this
one to DU, who now sports a 2-0
record. In the week’s remaining
matches, Beta downed Phi Kappa
Sig, 25-13, and a strong Delt team
won over Kappa Sig.

No change from last week’s rat-
ings. The best: 1. Phi Gam, 2-0, 2.
Phi Delt, 1-0; 3. KA, 2-0.

*Agnew Leads Squad;

Sewanee Places Four

College Athletic Conference cham-
pion Sewanee and runner-up Wash-
ington and Lee each placed four
men on the 1963 All-CAC football
team.

Sewanee’s Little All-American tail-
back M. L. Agnew led the 13-man
team picked by the conference’s five
coaches. Agnew is a repeater from
last year, along with Sewanee’s end
Bob Davis and Southwestern’s tackle
Challice McMillin.

The Generals placed end Buck

Ogilvie, fullback Henry Sackett,
tackle Jim Sylvester, and guard
George Gossman on the squad.

Tie votes at two positions—guard
and tackle—resulted in the confer-
ence’s second straight 13-man team.

Rounding out the squad were
guard Bob Rice and tackle Jim
Stewart of Sewanee, halfback Jon
Mars, Washington, quarterback Bert
Chafin and guard Bill Edington of
Southwestern, and center Tom Tay-
lor, of Centre.

Agnew and Davis were the only
unanimous choices. Five players got
three of the four votes possible (a
coach cannot vote for his own play-
ers). They were Sackett, Mars, Cha-
fin, Rice, and Stewart. Junior Jim
Stewart and sophomore Chafin were
the only underclassmen to make the
team.

Agnew practically rewrote the
conference record books in 1963, set-
ting new marks for rushing (835
yards), total offense (1,342 yards),
and scoring (60 points).

He is joined in the backfield by
Sackett (633 yards rushing), Chafin
(895 yards passing), and Mars, who

Catholic on Tuesday

Next Tuesday Washington and Lee’s basketball team will
meet the school that Coach Bob McHenry calls our toughest
regular season opponent. Catholic University will travel here
from Washington, hoping to repeat last year’s 65-41 victory.

This year’s Catholic team has only a 3-2 record thus far.
Their two defeats were by four points to Providence, last year’s
NIT champion and winner of 15 straight, and by two points
in overtime to Seton Hall, who has back last year’s leading
scorer, Mike Werkman.

McHenry said first team center Howie Martin, suffering
from a mild concussion, will not be able to play again until
after Christmas.

 

Sackett, Ogilvie, Sylvester Honored

Washington and Lee joined Hampden-Sydney and Emory
and Henry in placing three men on the AP’s Virginia small-
college football team, announced Tuesday. Fullback Henry
Sackett, end Buck Ogilvie, and tackle Jim Sylvester drew hon-
ors for the Generals.

Hampden-Sydney sophomore quarterback Whitey Lips-
comb was named captain of the team. His backfield was round-
ed out by E&H’s Earl Hawkins and C. A. Burton. Other mem-
bers of the team: end George Ueilig (H-S), tackle Purvis
Edwards (Frederick), guards Bill Bryant (E&H) and Sid
Druen (H-S), and center Billy Webster (Randolph-Macon).

 

Notice

Coach McHenry announces that any lacrosse player who
would like to obtain a copy of the 1964 Lacrosse Guide should
see him immediately.

(Continued from page 3)

Randolph-Macon, rated as the best
in Virginia small college basketball.

Several times Bridgewater caught
up, but in the end W&L held out
for a 66-62 victory. Leading the
General scoring was Paterno with
22, followed by Spessard with 12,
and Mindel with 11. Spessard also
led in rebounds with 17, while
freshman starter Jeff Twardy had 11
and Mindel 8.

Bridgewater’s Browder was the
game’s high scorer, with 23 points.

With many lettermen returning
Centre will be tough this year. In
their last two outings the Colonels
have scored over 90 points. Employ-
ing a strong offense, they like a fast
break.

Outstanding are last year’s all
CAC Tournament choices, center
Hal Smith and Guard Bel Borland.
Their leading scorer this year is
sophomore forward Mike Marks,
who would have made all tourna-
ment team had he not been a fresh-
man.Marks is 64”, and with 675”
sophomore Renny Waltz at the other
forward, the Colonels should not
have much trouble off the boards.

In last year’s game the Generals
got off to a quick start, gaining a
10 point lead at half-time, but Centre
fought back in the second half to
win 82-78.

W&L may be forced to shoot more
than it likes because of the Colonels’
pressing defense. The Generals will
be hurt on rebounds with starting
center Howard Martin still out,
but Coach Bob McHenry expects
him to be back in shape right after
the Christmas break.

Tuesday the Generals take on the
toughest opponent of the year, here
at W&L. Catholic University was
number two in the NIT tournament
last year. This year they lost to
Providence, last year’s NIT cham-
pion, by four points. In last year’s

Only 140 Dance Costumes
Sold—Resale To Be Held

Dance Board vice-president Steve
Hibbard announced that 140 Fancy
Dress costumes were sold during
this week’s two-day sale.

The costumes are being rented out
for the Mardi Gras ball on Friday
night of Fancy Dress. The rental
is handled by the Oak Hill Com-
pany of Roanoke.

Hibbard stated that in response to
a number of requests, another one-
day sale will be held after Christmas
vacation.

The cost of rental is $8.00, a de-
crease of $4.50 from last year. Cos-
tumes rental in pairs are $14.00.

“They are to be of the nature of
a ball room setting in contrast to
the street scene motif,’ Hibbard
commented. We hope that students
will take advantage of the wide var-
iety and high quality of costumes
that Oak Hall is offering.”

The date of the costumes sale in
January will be announced later,
Hibbard stated.

tive.”

But while Goldwater waits and
reassesses the new situation, time
for his planning a campaign for the
New Hampshire primary grows
shorter and shorter. The Rockefeller
campaign is becoming consolidated
in New Hampshire, and if Goldwater
tries to enter the race at a late date
he may find himself losing a state he
ought to win if early polls are to be
believed. Rockefeller has been cam-
paigning for a month, and campaign-
ing thoroughly.

And while both Rockefeller and
Goldwater forces wait out the pro-
litical moratorium honoring John
F. Kennedy, the “darkhorses” come
into more and more prominence.
Cabot Lodge manages to get pub-
licity all the way from South Viet
Nam, perhaps due to the influence
of General Eisenhower. Pennsyl-
vania Gover Scranton is boosted as
the Republican hope to appropri-
ate the old Kennedy image of
youth and vigor. Richard Nixon,
who lost to President Kennedy by
a hair, looks much stronger against
Johnson than he did against Ken-
nedy.

However, these are conditions that
are not outside our control, they do
not work through some mysterious
means. If we are to determine the
course of our future and not allow
our future to be determined by fac-
tors inconsistent with our goals, we
need only, to a large extent, recog-
nize the interrelated nature of many
social and economic problems; and
set the course of action along such
interrelated lines. Labor’s Economic
Review has recently published ar-

ticles which offer that “meeting
America’s social needs (public
schools, housing, urban renewal,

community facilities, hospitals) will
meet America’s job needs.” Much of

accept a change imposed on it by
that body.

Of course, such unfortunate con-
troversy could easily be prevented
by the EC itself if that group would
only publicize its proceedings and
voluntarily open a discussion on the
rightfulness of its powers. We would
like to see the EC show that it
believes that school government
should be a “mutual thing.”

sions built up by unemployment
which has generally hit the Negro
harder than any one group.
Amplifying TVA Plan

We have in the past moved for-
ward to solve connecting needs by
formulating concrete and significant
planning. TVA is perhaps the best
example of a successful program
that moved into a depressed area not
with limited designs on improve-
ment but with a general assessment
of the situation. While the ideas
of TVA have been avidly studied by
other nations and implemented in
such countries as Ceylon, Parkistan,
and India, we have failed to make
full use of this valuable concept of
“a corporation clothed with the pow-
er of government but possessed with
the flexibility and initiative of priv-
ate enterprise.”—Franklin Roosevelt.

We must finally come to recognize
that if American democracy is to
have meaning in the Twentieth Cen-
tury both domestically and to the
newer nations of the Afro-Asian
Bloc, we must combine the power of
the Federal government to meet the
power of modern problems and ac-
tivate the tradition of American
imagination to meet the dilemma of
modern society.

H.M.A. Leads New Probe
Of Current Combo Prices

By STIRLING LATHROP

The House Managers’ Association
has begun an inquiry into the com-
parative prices of combos hired at
W&L as opposed to the prices the
same bands charge at other nearby
schools. This investigation is part of
a general strengthening of the As-
sociation’s current functions and an
enlarging of its responsibility.

Hansley Fills
Info Position

Gene B. Hansley of Altavista, Va.,
has been named assistant director of
information services for the Univer-
sity.

Hansley, 27, will assume his new
duties Dec. 26, succeeding A. Pres-
cott Rowe who resigned to take a
public relations position with the
Reynolds Metals Company of Rich-
mond.

Hansley was formerly employed
by the Lynchburg News where for
two years he was religious editor
and feature editor. Previously he
worked three years as an advertis-
ing copywriter in the advertising
department of the publishing agen-
cy of the Southern Baptist Conven-
tion in Nashville, Tenn.

Hansley is a 1956 B.A. graduate of
the University of Richmond. He also
has studied public relations at the
University of Tennessee’s Nashville
Extension, and he has studied at the
University of North Carolina sum-
mer session.

His Washington and Lee work will
involve him in general public re-
lations, with emphasis on relations
between the university and repre-
sentatives of the press, radio, and
television media.

 

 

Jim Slay, president of the Asso-
ciation, said that there has long
been a belief that W&L is being
unaccountably overcharged by some
of the combos which play here for
fraternity parties. A committee has
been formed to inquire about combo
prices at other schools, giving due
consideration for traveling expenses
which would alleviate the price of
any combo somewhat.

Schools Being Contacted

Numerous schools are being con-
tacted in this survey. Some are the
University of North Carolina, the
University of Virginia, the Univer-
sity of Richmond. If the findings
show that W&L is being over-
charged, the committee will recom-
mend a solution. Student recommen-
dations will be invited.

The project of regulation of com-
bo prices has formerly been one of
the tasks of the Executive Commit-
tee. When the committee reported
that it did not have time to con-
sider the matter, it was turned over
to the House Managers’ Association.
This current study is actually the
first serious study of the problem to
date.

Employment Roster

Another matter which the H.M.A.
is handling is fraternity house hired
help. Duke Terrell and Doug
Hagestad, vice president and secre-
tary respectively, have established
a file committee which will set up
an employment roster. The commit-
tee will contact, interview, and
screen the help which is available
in the area. Then a list will be
compiled and referred to each fra-
ternity house. According to Slay, it
will not be a “black list,” but merely
a means of facilitating the hiring of
help when it is needed.

Politics ----‘Buttons And Baloney’

 

Dr. Leyburn Accompanist

 

WREL Slates Taped Concert

Radio Washington and Lee will
present an hour-long program of
taped music at 8 p.m. Thursday,
preceding the University Christ-
mas service.

The program, first of its kind for
Radio Washington and Lee, consists
of a balanced hour of songs sung by
W&L baritone John Baker and Mrs.
Delores Jones, local mezzo-soprano.
Baker and Mrs. Jones are accom-
panied by Dr. James G. Leyburn,
head of W&L’s sociology department,
and an accomplished pianist.

Baker, an SAE senior from Suf-
folk, Va. has been singing “for
years” and has been a member of
the Glee Club and Sazeracs while
here.

Lylburn Downing, has been trained

Memorial Episcopal Church choir.
The taped program begins with
three songs by Hugo Wolfe, sung
by Mrs. Jones, three old English
songs and Schubert’s Omnipotence,
by Baker, and a duet from Mozart's
Don Giovanna with both soloists.

Mrs. Jones sings some Christmas
spirituals, and Baker does two sea-
sonal songs. Perhaps the high point
of the recording is the portion the
two soloists sing from Porgy and
Bess; “I got Plenty of Nothing,”
Baker; “Summertime,” Jones; and
“Bess, You Is My Woman Now,”
Jones and Baker.

The project was planned and in-
directly supervised by John K. Jen-
nings for the Department of Jour-
nalism, although program selection
was left entirely to the soloists.
Dr. Leyburn, who worked with the
two from the beginning, is respon-
sible for the musical discipline of
their performances.

Dr. Edward Turner taped the con-
cert in the Lee Chapel with pro-
fessional recording equipment. The
taped concert evoked unusual praise
from both students and faculty.
Bob Mottley, W&L senior and long
a student of “good music,” said that
“Anyone who can appreciate good,
all-round singing must hear this
tape. While Baker and Jones are in-
dividually excellent, they are marve-
lously effective in the duets from
Giovanni and Porgy and Bess.”

Journalism professor Mr. Jennings
said that “Delores Jones singing of
Summertime is beautiful and mov-
ing, and John Baker has one of the
finest non-profession male singing
voices I’ve ever heard.”

 

Grenier Reviews Party Structure
Avoids Topic Of Partisan Issues

By CHARLES NEWMAN
News Editor
Last night in duPont Auditorium John E. Grenier spoke
on the structure of the Republican Party. Grenier, after his
talk, was present at a reception at the Kappa Sigma House,
where partisan subjects were discussed.
Partisan subjects were not a part of his speech due to the

moratorium which has been de-*

clared by the Republican Party in
respect for the late John F. Kennedy.

Grenier opened his talk by stating
that politics are a business and that
it offers vast opportunities for par-
ticipation in political process on all
levels. He stated that there are two
chief aims of political parties: to
present a consensus of the views of
the members of the party and to
nominate a candidate to articulate
their views.

Party Has Short Life

The Republican Party exists only
for three or four days a year ac-
cording to Grenier. This is the time
of the National Convention during
which measures are adopted to con-
trol the Party for the next four
years.

The National Committee is the
group which lays the groundwork
for the Republican Party. This com-
mittee is composed of two represen-
tatives from each of the fifty states—
one man and one woman.

State Level

On the state level there are also
committees. Grenier used Alabama
as an example of the state set up:
in that state each county sends rep-
resentatives who are apportioned
according to the percentage of the
vote in each county cast for the Re-
publican candidate in the last presi-

 

 

dential election. From this conven-
tion a state committee is elected
which oversees the political activities
in the state for the next four years.

Making of a Candidate

Grenier brought out four points
which he felt must be followed to
have a_ successful candidate. The
party must have a good candidate,
issues, organization, and money. The
candidate must be careful not to say
anything that will turn people
against him—candidates lose votes by
saying the wrong things rather than
gain votes by saying the right things.

Button, Balloons, and Baloney

The political organization is guid-
ed by what Grenier calls “buttons,
balloons and baloney.” The organi-
zation has to make people get out to
vote and to vote for their party.
Grenier stated that only 45 per cent
of those who can register do so, and
that only 65 per cent of those that
register vote. He repeatedly empha-
sized the importance of the “block
man” in the political organization—
the man who knocks on doors.

Grenier’s speech was arranged by
the Steering Committee of the 1964
Mock Convention to acquaint stu-
dents with the structure of the Re-
publican Party as a background for
the Mock Convention to be held this
Spring.

‘Absolute Power Corrupts

Absolutely’—But At W&L?

Some people won’t be happy with this editorial. We
aren’t very happy with it ourselves because it implies that
something is wrong with our student government. We
said last Tuesday that we believe a small minority of the
Executive Committee controls our student affairs. The
incidents upon which we based this statement are cited
below. Perhaps they don’t offer real proof; we don’t claim
them as proof. We simply feel they open the door for
doubt as to the quality of our system of government.

Neither of the incidents we shall describe were re-
ported to you, the student. Since both stories would have
affected you had they not been swept under the carpet,
we feel it is not our right to hold back the facts we know.
We do not choose to support one side or the other in
either matter; we do think you have the right to know
when a decision is made in our student government. We
thus offer you the following two incidents, just as they
should have appeared in the page one news columns.

Assimilation Proposal Squelched

At the beginning of this semester, the Assimilation
Committee worked for some time on a proposal which it
felt would improve the belabored conventional dress sit-
uation. The plan: coats and ties would be worn by all
students at least until 10:30 weeknights, and 1 p.m. Sat-
urdays. Dress after these hours would be such “‘as benefits
a gentleman.” When the proposal was taken to the EC,
it was approved by a 7-3 vote. Bill Noell, president, did not
vote. Against the proposal were law students Jim Rowe
and Jim Kulp, and sophomore representative Chuck
Walker.

In the week following this meeting, Jim Maffit, Assi-
milation Committee Chairman, was grilled by several peo-
ple. EC members whose votes had been “‘yes’’ also were
questioned. The newspaper was told to keep the pro-
posal’s acceptance out of print. By the time of the next
EC meeting, seven days later, Mafhit withdrew his commit-
tee’s proposal and the EC’s acceptance of it was “rescind-
ed.” That is one incident.

Forum Constitution Defeated

The Steering Committee of the Leadership Forum,
composed of twelve students, designated by a four-man
subcommittee to draft a constitution for the entire Forum.
This was done, and a meeting of the full committee to
discuss and vote on the constitution was called. The sub-
committee felt that a majority of the members of the full
committee would accept their constitution. Their plan
would, in effect, make the Student Forum (which is com-
posed of the leaders of all campus organizations) into a
legislative body. The Student Forum would have a gen-
uine say in the supervision of student body affairs.

The Thursday-night meeting was suddenly—even
mysteriously called off. At least one of the members of
the committee did not even know it had been postponed.
A meeting was re-called five days later, at which some
members of the full committee talked disparagingly of
the new constitution which had been written. The consti-
tution was defeated by a decivise vote—7 to 4 (one mem-
ber of the committee being absent).

Draw Your Own Conclusions—We Have

You draw your own conclusions about these two
events. Perhaps there is nothing to them. We think there
is. In the first instance, it is obvious that the opinion of a
strong majority of the EC was in favor of the Assimila-
tion Committee’s proposal. The vote was recorded. One
week later the proposal was withdrawn. The issue was
buried. It seems to us that the minority which opposed
the proposal must have exerted some stiff pressure to get
the proposal withdrawn. It was a plan into which the As-
similation Committtee had put a considerable amount of
time and thought. It would seem that the students who
conceived the idea could not be convinced easily that
they were totally wrong—wrong enough to withdraw
their idea from debate.

In the second instance we have a subcommittee which
was writing a constitution. Why should they spend their
time writing one which they felt would not pass the full
Steering Committee, and then the forum itself? Members
of the subcommittee have indicated they believe in their
constitution and felt it would pass. But it did not—indeed,
it was soundly defeated. It was defeated after a sudden,
still unexplained postponement of the meeting at which
the constitution was to be discussed and voted upon.

Persuasive Tactics Used: Right or Wrong?

Was the original meeting postponed to give oppon-
ents of the constitution time to apply pressure in the right
places? Only a few people can be sure—and they cer-
tainly won’t talk. But one of the four students who helped
write the original constitution cast his vote against it at the
re-called meeting. We wonder. ..

Nothing is wrong with the power of legitimate per-
suasion. But it is possible some of the persuasive tactics
used by some of the “‘powers-that-be” in our student gov-
ernment are not so legitimate? We can’t say yes or no.

What do you think?

   
 

Pigeon Feathers and Other Stories.
John Updike, Crest, 1962, 50c.
Before we praise or mutilate Pi-

geon Feathers, as the fancy takes us,

a few words might be said about

such activities in general and this

column in particular.

The idea that I could have any-
thing of worthwhile critical value to
say about this or any other book is
ridiculous. It is simply a game. Not
that my reaction is not valid— it is
at least mine and you are entitled to
one, too; everyone, hopefully, learns
to criticize, to weigh, and repect or
accept.

But literary criticism is a ser-
ious matter and ninety percent of
the people who try it don’t know
what they are talking about. Lit-
erature is the highest product of
an animal who can write, and a
good judge must know a lot more
about life and literature in gener-
al to provide a sound judgment
and an understanding that goes
beyond “liking” and “disliking.”
On this level, as I said, it’s a
game—and as long as we don’t for-
get that, it can be a good one.

Readers who enjoyed Rabbit, Run
could do worse than pursue Updike’s
latest collection of stories. At his
lowest level, he is what is often re-
ferred to as a “craftsman”: that is to
say, he has a good sense of taste and
balance. He is frequently much more
than this.

Most of the stories are concerned
with marriage. Marriage that has
gone stale, not dramatically but
slowly and sickeningly. Updike is
very sensitive to the ways people
in these situations play games and
the ways in which they hurt each
other. The characters live in their
little worlds, unable to break outside
or to establish contact within their
marriage.

this with his wife. Her answer is
final and characteristic: “Eat your
egg.”

This is the same theme that Up-
dike explores more fully in his
novel. I know nothing of Updike’s
personal situation nor do I care
to, for these stories are more than
a personal statement. In a society
that puts less and less emphasis
on family, one might well wonder
what the purpose of marriage is—
especially when it twists people

into the shape of Updike’s char-
acters. Only once do they make it,
in one of the best stories, “Wife-
Wooing.”

The title story is concerned with
a young boy’s initiation into relig-
ious doubt; it is well-done, but too
neatly resolved for my taste. Per-
haps we would rather have our
doubts remain? The stories about
high-school are very fine, the best
I have ever read; Updike’s latest
novel, Centaur, is about high-school
but I haven’t read it.

The stock objection to Updike is
that he is “New Yorker through
and through.” This is true, if it
means anything. This magazine
tends to groom favored writers
and force them into a mold so
that they write only stories that
fit a certain “formula.” Some time
ago this was described as “like
writing for any other magazine
and then cutting off the last two
paragraphs,” This is no longer an
accurate description, but if “fine
writing,” innuendo, and an aware-
ness of America’s hard-to-define-
but-present social structure were
added, it might come close.

What does this mean? I feel that
the New Yorker ruined J. D, Saling-
er. It doesn’t follow that everyone
who writes for this magazine is sup-
erficial and worthless. Shakespeare
wrote for a “formula.” Virgil wrote
for a “formula.” The accusation is
strictly neutral. It is evident that
Updike has something that he wants
to say—the last two stories, written
in a sort of Proustian recherchee
fashion that is pleasantly experi-
mental, point this out to my satisfac-
tion—and there are not enough good
writers around today to toss one out
with such a superficial objection.

‘Certain Topics ... Were Taboo’

The halls were deserted, but under
the sills of various of the cubicles
could be seen a light. Voices could
be heard also, some in monotones,
some very highly pitched—some al-
most a whisper. At the end of the
corridor, where the gate was, stood
a man, tall, well built, very alert.
It was Christmas season.

From the outside, it was a large
solid brick building, recently con-
structed. It had no outstanding fea-
tures, nothing to attract the eye, four
people walking by it always stopped
a minute to look, before they con-
tinued to go about their normal busi-
ness.

It was referred to in two ways.
Those inside spoke of it as “it,” or
“here.” On the outside it was hardly
referred to, or else it was simply
termed “there.”

Certain parts of it had no stranger
appearance than that of a well-kept,

second-class hotel. Downstairs was
partitioned. One half resembled a
large, barren recreation room. In the
center was a library table, covered
with magazines and newspapers.
There were chairs around the table
and situated strategically through-
out the room. The other half of the
downstairs contained equipment.
About thirty people were assembled
in the room, all separate, some talk-
ing, some quiet, none listening.

One sat in a corner, tearing a
newspaper, absently, as though it
had no significance. At the back of
the room a woman recited, in a mon-
otone, the Communist Manifesto, In
the center of the group stood a tall,
skinny boy, gesticulating wildly, who
was shouting his allegiance to the
Nazi party. Two people were seated
in armchairs, facing each other—one
explaining the world situation to the
other—the latter giving a lecture on

advanced physics.

Eleven sat on the floor, silent ex-
cept for an occasional motion.

The second floor, which was a
large gallery circumnavigating the
recreation room, adjoining to a series
of corridors, had chairs permanent-
ly assigned around the gallery, and
in some of these, white coated men
with serious expressions watched the
scenes going on below.

In one of a set of offices on the
top floor, a soft-spoken man listen-
ed to one of the inmates.

Through an open door the voices
of two doctors talked about one of
the schizophrenics.

“If we could only get her to talk—
to express an opinion—about any-
thing.”

At the other end of town—at a
holiday cocktail party, 21 assembled
couples talked cheerfully. Certain
topics, of course, were taboo.

Professor Gives Advice to Freshman Son
On Basic Aspects of Carreer in College

By DR. JOHN ADEN

Advice is something everyone
has, but which few people can give
well. In an open letter to his son
last year, English Professor John
M. Aden gave advice worth the
attention of freshmen and upper-
classmen alike.

Dear Son,

Advice is an incorrigible vice of
parenthood, and you can only take
consolation (or chagrin) in the fact
that you will yourself suecumb to it
in the fullness of time. But let me try
to bring it all together once more—
just once more—and I will promise
to try to do better in the future.

I sent you to the school you are
attending because I thought it
good, because I thought it offered
you the most versitile possibilities
of a rounded education, that I
could ascertain. Whether I mis-
judged must await the test, but
that is what I strove for—a com-
prehensive opportunity for qual-
ity of every kind. What do I
expect of you in return? Nothing,
I hope, that you would not want,
or that it would not profit you, to
give.

Of course I want, and expect, you
to study. I would like to see you
make good grades, the Dean’s List,
Phi Eta Sigma, and eventually Phi

Beta Kappa. This means hitting the
books, with steadiness, purpose, and
resolve. It means doing the “night
work,” preparing the assignments,
boning for the tests, with the min-
imum of beer breaks commensurate
with sanity.

But I hope I have already indi-
cated to you that while old-fash-
ioned, hard study goes a long way
in this business of getting educated,
it by no means achieves that end of
itself merely. Almost anyone who
puts his back into it can become a
bookworm and a blockhead. How to
avoid such doom, without scuttling
study, is what I want to be sure
you understand and act upon.

For one thing, you will not (like
some of your professors, possibly)
mistake your textbook for the uni-
versity. You will study it, but you
will read beyond it—not just “paral-
lel” stuff, but books, good books,
hard books, strange books, big books,
little books, old books, new books.
You will, in short, cut loose in the
stacks (which, don’t forget, are
open) or in some dorm-mate’s book
shelf or some professor’s or chap-
lain’s study, or wherever, and find
something that you want to read, or,
baiting that, just something to read,
something to fill up your still half-
empty head, something to exercise
the grey matter, something to ballast
the lecture notes, something to edu-

cate you or quicken your imagina-
tion.

And you will talk, if not in class
(it isn’t always possible), then with
profs on the wing or among your
cronies, in the hangout, over a beer,
across the bed, at table, or over the
back seat returning from Sweetbriar
(where you might have tried
talking a little with her). But you
won’t do all the talking though some
of it, and a lot of listening; and you'll
pick brains and suffer yours to be
picked trying, with your fellows, to
learn something from someone who
knows more than you do, or some-
thing other than you do. And you
will be willing to argue, over things
that are arguable. You will, in
short, exercise the intellect you are
building.

We've already been over the busi-
ness of courses, and I think we were
right to plan for scope instead of
narrowsness. Graduate school is time
enough to specialize, just now we
want to furnish your mind gener-
ously and to set it free.

They talk about Washington and
Lee as a party school, but you and
I know that is precisely one reason
why we chose it. We weren't, after
all, looking for a monastery, but
for a place where your total man-
hood could be brought into play
and tested. That is why I expect

Coun Syuire :

By ADDISON BROCKENBROUGH

December 9, 1963
Monday

I had an interesting talk today
with a student who plans to enter
seminary next year. He visited a
well-known northern theological
school over Thanksgiving, and there
the Dean told him of the role that
seminary’s students play in national
affairs.

The Dean spoke with pride about
the students from his school who had
been thrown in Mississippi jails. The
seminary had taken no cetion until
one of its professors was also jailed.
It was a matter of pride to this par-
ticular Dean that his students had
stood up for what they believed.

I couldn’t help but think that had
Washington and Lee students been
jailed in Mississippi, they probably
would have been placed on conduct
probation for the rest of their stay
here. Perhaps they would have been
thrown out of school altogether.

December 10, 1963
Tuesday

As I understand it, a political con-
servative is opposed to a concen-
tration of powers in government. It
seems funny, therefore, that when
the Tuesday Edition of the paper
proposes that the campus press be
taken out from under the control of
the student government, the oppon-
ents of the proposal are the so-called
political conservatives. And the stu-
dents who are making the proposal
are labeled liberals—even “radicals.”
Someone is being inconsistent.

December 11, 1963
Wednesday

A rather sickening discovery: over
Thanksgiving here in Lexington, the
lights went out for quite some time.
The stores were open, and most of
them lost quite a bit of merchandise.
Apparently the food stores suffered
most—one in particular had its meat
counter completely stripped. And a
couple identified as a Washington
and Lee student with his wife were
seen leaving this same store, he with
his overcoat loaded with goods, and
she carrying everything she could
handle. The cosmetic counter also
had been stripped in that particular
store.

December 12, 1963
Thursday

Why should the physical education
department be allowed to fail a
student who misses eight classes
(whether he’s on the Dean’s List or
not). Especially when there is no
such thing as an “excused absence”
in P.E. Those eight cuts are theoret-
ically to be used when one is not
feeling well, or when one is going to
be out of town (even on school bus-
iness).

December 13, 1963
Friday

A word about the Friday Edition’s
unrealistic editorial: I don’t believe
conventional dress is a “mutually
agreed-upon practice.” And the let-
ter which appeared in this edition,
endorsing the abolition of the As-
similation Committee, signed by half
of that came committee and a few
EC members, indicates to me that
the “means of enforcement” is not
“mutually agreed-upon,” as the edi-
torial states.

Conventional dress is a “tradi-
tional rule” in my opinion, and as
such it should have some of the ves-
tiges of a rule, as well as the appear-
ance of a tradition. Or it will die.

much more than I can say for a vast
majority of my student colleagues.
I got a brief insight into the reason
why last night: a forlorn fraternity
man, engaged in that post-party rit-
ual which I indelicately refer to as
the “rite of barf.” Some day, he too
will see the light.

Hoopsters Lose;

Play C.U. Next

By TOM CARPENTER
Tuesday Sports Writer

The prospects for a Washington
and Lee basketball championship in
the CAC tournament seem small
as the Generals have already found
one team in the eonference that is
stronger than they are. Saturday’s
game with Centre College provided
evidence for this statement as the
Colonels rolled to an easy 86-70 vic-
tory over the Generals at Centre.

W&L is now even for four games
but plays host to tough Catholic
University tonight at 8:00. Catholic
is led by veterans Bill Lehay and
Charlie Boylan. The visitors bring
with them a record of 4-3 and a
recent victory over Roanoke Col-
lege, one of the more highly re-
garded teams in Virginia.

The Colonels took the lead for
keeps about midway through the
first half and coasted from there.
The first half shooting percentages
tell the story as the winners hit on
60 per cent of their shots while
W&L could make only 25 per cent of
their attempts.

The Generals also were defeated
by their own sloppy ball handling
and Centre’s complete control of the
boards. The losers lost the ball 20
times on bad passes and steals.

Louie Paterno, W&L’s star guard,
was the leading scorer for the game
with 20 points, while Don Wallis
contributed 12 and Fred Mindel

Miller’s matmen meet an un-
*defeated West Virginia University
team who walloped VMI Saturday,
19-9. This is expected to be one of
the year’s most exciting matches,
pitting two of the area’s top wrest-
ling teams and some of the South’s
finest individual matches in the “bat-
tle of the unbeatens.”

In the two matches this weekend,
W&lL first met Hartwick College and
pins by Pete Winfield and Steward
led the Generals to an easy, 21-8
victory. General leader Smith, who
crushed his opponent easily, 18-0, Ed
Jansen and Stover all gained de-
cisions to help the winning cause.
Dick Musick, in the 130-pound class,
contributed two points by gaining a
draw.

Oneonta State College provided
much stiffer competition, and the
Generals needed pins by Steward—
his second in three matches—and
Musick for a 19-13 decision. Smith
and Stover both added their second
victories, and 137-pounder Don Pat-
terson gained his first win of the
season, 5-2, to account for the ad-
ditional team tallies,

Part II—‘Who To Watch This Winter’

Tankmen Eye Good Year;
Depth Brings 2-1 Record

By GEORGE BOKINSKY

The W&L swimming team, coached by NORRIS EASTMAN, has pro-
duced a 2 and 1 record so far this season. Returning members of last
year’s squad, along with a strong group of freshmen, present a promising
outlook for the remaining meets of the season.

Victorious in its first meet of the season over Roanoke College, then
bowing to a strong UVa. team, W&L bounced back with a win over
Loyola of Baltimore. Traveling to Washington on Wednesday the tank-
men will swim Catholic University in the last contest before the Christmas
break. Practices this week indicated that the team will be in good shape
for the meet.

With the unusual depth of the team, Coach Eastman is able to juggle
his swimmers from event to event. JIM WALLENSTEIN, co-captain, is
performing well in the breaststroke, with the other captain, WALT Mc-
MANUS, doing well in both the butterfly and 200-yard freestyle. McManus
was on the record-setting freestyle relay in the Loyola meet.

Among the junior lettermen returning from last year’s squad is BILL
BRODDUS—a backstroker who set a school record in that event against
Loyola. Broaddus was also on the opening medley relay team that holds
a W&L school mark. SKIP CHASE, who swam mainly breaststroke last
season, now takes on an additional race in the 50-yard freestyle. JOHN
WOLFE, a returning record-holder, is proficient in almost all the freestyle
races.

Only two sophomore letermen are returning from last year’s Varsity.
JOHN LIFTER, former holder of backstroke mark, now is a member of the
record-holding medley relay. Lifter is able to swim the individual medley,
breaststroke, backstroke, 500-yard frestyle, as wel las the relay. GEORGE
BOKINSKY, individual medley and butterfly records, swims in the individ-
ual medley, butterfly, breaststroke, or medley relay.

In the diving event two starters from last season’s team have returned.
BRUCE HOUGHTON and DAVE GREER have performed well in that
event this year. Against Loyola, Houghton and Greer took the top two
places.

Promising members of last year’s “B” squad are vieing for positions.
STEVE CASE is rapidly improving in the 500 freestyle as is HOWARD
BUSSE who, in addition, can swim the butterfly. NELSON WILLIAMS
participates in several events, but concentrates mainly on the freestyle
races.

A member of both record-setting relays, STEVE LESTER is near the
school mark in the 100-yard free. Lester is capable of swimming the
breaststroke and individual medley in addition. Also close to a record
is BART TAYLOR—on the record freestyle relay. Taylor swims the 50 and
100 freestyle. GARY BOKINSKY, another member of the record-holding
relay, concentrates on the 200 and 500-yard freestyle and on the individ-
ual medley.

BILL WILDRICK swam the butterfly leg of the record-breaking relay.
Wildrick can swim a variety of events with proficiency. He is able to
swim in the relay, butterfly, individual medley, and several freestyles.
BLAIR BROWN has done well in the individual medley. STEVE LUNDE
is showing a great deal of promise in the backstroke, losing to Broaddus by
only a touch in the event.

The added depth of the team also increases the competition for starting
positions. This competition will result in the better efforts that will lead
to a winning season.

Generals Take Five ‘Firsts,’
Wolfe, Broaddus Set Marks

By SKIP CHASE
Tuesday Sports Writer
The Generals of Norris Eastman ruled the waves Saturday
afternoon in nipping Loyola of Baltimore, 49-46. Bringing

their seasonal mark to 2-1, the “Big Blue” was lead by John
Wolfe, Bill Broaddus, Bruce Houton, Pete Taylor, and Jim

Wallenstein, all of whom took cru-*
tial firsts.

W&L won the medley relay, the

 

50-yard freestyle, placed first and
second in the diving, and first and
second in the 200-yard breaststroke.
School records were set by Wolfe,
the 500-yard free; Broaddus, the
200-yard back; and the medley relay.
Eclipsing a pool record set by the
University of Maryland, W&L’s un-
official freestyle relay of Lester,
Gary Bokinsky, McManus and Tay-
lor capped a good day and a close
meet.

(Author of “Rally Round the Flag, Boys!”
and “Barefoot Boy With Cheek’’.)

DECK THE HALLS

The time has come to think of Christmas shopping, for the
Yuletide will be upon us quicker than you can say Jack Robin-
son. (Have you ever wondered, incidentally, about the origin
of this interesting phrase “Quicker than you can say Jack
Robinson”? Well sir, the original saying was French—“Plus
vite que de dire Jacques Robespierre.” Jack Robinson is, as every-
one knows, an Anglicization of Jacques Robespierre who was,
as everyone knows, the famous figure from the French Revolu-
tion who, as everyone knows, got murdered in his bath by
Danton, Murat, Caligula, and Al Capone.

(The reason people started saying “Quicker than you can
say Jacques Robespierre’’—or Jack Robinson, as he is called in
English-speaking countries like England, the U.S., and Cleve-
land—is quite an interesting little story. It seems that Robes-
pierre’s wife, Georges Sand, got word of the plot to murder
her husband in his bath. All she had to do to save his life was
call his name and warn him. But, alas, quicker than she could
say Jacques Robespierre, she received a telegram from her old
friend Frederie Chopin who was down in Majorca setting lyrics

    
 

ee ne

as | ie rte A me om a :
Al 4he bad to co 03 call Ws name

to his immortal “Warsaw Concerto.” Chopin said he needed

Georges Sand’s help desperately because he could not find a

rhyme for “Warsaw.” Naturally, Georges could not refuse

such an urgent request.

(Well sir, off to Majorca went Georges, but before she left,
she told her little daughter Walter that some bad men were
coming to murder Daddy in his bath. She instructed Walter
to shout Robespierre’s name the moment the bad men arrived.
But Walter, alas, had been sea-bathing that morning on the
Riviera, and she had come home with a big bag of salt water
taffy, and when the bad men arrived to murder Robespierre,
Walter, alas, was chewing a wad of taffy and could not get her
mouth unstuck in time to shout a warning. Robespierre, alas,
was murdered quicker than you could say Jacques Robespierre
—or Jack Robinson, as he is called in English-speaking countries.

(There is, I am pleased to report, one small note of cheer
in this grisly tale. When Georges Sand got to Majorca, she did
succeed in helping Chopin find a rhyme for “Warsaw” as every-
one knows who has heard those haunting lyrics:

In the fair town of Warsaw,
Which Napoleon’s horse saw,
Singing cockles and mussels, alive alive o!)

But I digress.

We were speaking of Christmas gifts. What we all try to
find at Christmas is, of course, unusual and distinctive gifts for
our friends. May I suggest then a carton of Marlboro Cigarettes?

What? You are astonished? You had not thought of Marlboros

 

as unusual? You had regarded them as familiar, reliable smokes
whose excellence varied not one jot nor tittle from year to year?
True. All true. But all the same, Marlboros are unusual be-

cause every time you try one, it’s like the first time. The flavor
never palls, the filter never gets hackneyed, the soft pack is

ever a new delight, and so is the Flip Top box. Each Marlboro
is a fresh and pristine pleasure, and if you want all your friends
to clap their hands and cry, “Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa
Claus!” you will see that their stockings are filled with Marl-

boros on Christmas morn. ® 1963 Max Shulman

* * *

The holiday season or any other season is the season to be
jolly—if Marlboro is your brand, You'll find Marlboros wher-
ever cigarettes are sold in all fifty states of the Union. You
get a lot to like in Marlboro Country.

H.M.A. Screens Applicants

For Fraternity Positions
(Continued from page 1)

The proposal that the fraternities
coordinate food purchases in order
to obtain discount through volume
was not passed in the H.M.A., as
the idea would require a salaried
overseer and whatever discount to
be gained would be lost to his salary.

Fraternity Service

In the past H.M.A. has been all
but inactive, and seeks to take a
greater role as a service to the col-
lege. Composed of the house manag-
ers and house treasurers, the H.M.A.
is working with the Executive Com-
mittee, the Interfraternity Council,
and the faculty to develop itself as a
functional, purposeful organization
orientated around fraternity serv-
ice. It has in the past seen to the
assistance with house staffs, house
maintenance, and procurement, and
sees to special pest control as well
as the annual pest protection.

 

 

Sound Advice Given By Dr. Aden

you to join a frat, raise a certain
amount of hell, and practice the
fine art of smoking, drinking, and
girl watching—not for the hell of
it merely, but for the heaven of it
too; not to grovel in any of it, but
to grow by it in—yes—just plain
experience, but ultimately in depth
of understanding, wisdom of
choice in temperance and refine-
ment, and in generosity and con-
sideration, both for yourself and
for others (including that sweet
little thing from Sweetbriar). I
cannot praise a fugitive and clois-
tered virtue either. I don’t really
think there is any such thing.

I want you to ride off in many
directions, to involve yourself as
diversely as you can without fall-
ing into the gulf of mere super-
ficiality, to study, converse, extra-
curricular it, learn the superiority
of Scotch over Bourbon, the stupidi-
ty of smoking, the absurdity of bob-
bed hair, the excitement of good
drama, art and music (which will
include Dixieland, but not country
music), the joy and friendship and

‘Ariel’ Enters
Second Year

By BILL CHAPLIN

The autumn issue of Ariel, which
was delayed at the printer's during
December, is now on sale at the Co-
op and at the Book Shop. This issue
is the first of three issues to be pub-
lished this year, the next two issues
coming in March and in May.

The present issue is an expanded
and radically revamped version of
the attempts last year to publish
a worthwhile student literary mag-
azine. The new issue is fifty pages
long, and contains short stories,
poetry, and book reviews. Four of
the works came from Hollins, Ran-
dolph-Macon, and Mary Baldwin,
and editor Bill Kinsey hopes to con-
tinue the trend, begun last year, to
publish contributions from nearby
schools. Ariel remains, however, a
W&L literary magazine.

The response to calls for manu-
scripts early in the fall was sur-
prisingly good, and a number of
fine works could not be published

several short stories were submitted
that were fully drawn even while
they were not so long as to domi-
nate an entire issue ,and six of these
were selected for this issue. Their
range in style and subject matter is
broad.

Steve Henry’s At Six on a Sun-..
day Morning is a funny story, told
with an ironic realistic description
that cloaks the absurdity of his
main character, who is naked in
a public phone booth near a lake
out of which he has brought two
mallard ducks. Robert Mac Rives’
Slippery Hips is lyrical and Joyce-
an and relies much on fantasy for
its effectiveness. Sarah Gordon's
story is wildly impresisonistic. Tom
Goar, Susie McGown, Bill Kinsey
and Anton Devreau_ contribute
stories whose style is more tradi-
tional.

There is also a wide range of
poetry, some of it serious in its treat-
ment of subjects, and some of it
comic or ironic, contributed by Bill
Chaplin, Rod Cockshutt, Dina Coe,
Theodore Hirschfield, Bill Kinsey,
and Rodney Stump. The reviews by
Rod Cockshutt and Llewellyn Smith
are of two recent and important
books by Cleanth Brooks and Jean
Genet.

Ariel hopes to find among its con-
tributions for the next issue (dead-
line for submitting manuscripts is
February 15) outstanding essays,
which published, would be of inter-
est to the liberal arts student. This
would expand the scope of the mag-
azine to include both imaginative fic-
tion and imaginative essays of more
than routine interest.

In this way, Ariel hopes to fulfill
a need, to bridge the gap between
Shenandoah, whose function is to
publish professional writing and
criticism, and the Southern Colle-
gian.

Humphrey Finishes Fall Series
With Analysis Of Southerners

By WARREN MONTGOMERY

Last night in Lee Chapel,
William Humphrey gave his
fourth and concluding speech
as this term’s Glasgow Visiting
Professor.

Mr. Humphrey did not lec-
ture on a literary topic. “I have been
straining myself,” he explained, “as
a literary critic, which I am not.”

Instead, he read part one of his
forthcoming novel, Look Away, Look
Away, a study of Southern psychol-
ogy in novel form. In part one, en-
titled “In a Country Churchyard,”
Mr. Humphrey attempts to explain
the Southerner’s preoccupation with
the past, particularly in regard to the
War Between the States. He illus-
trates this preoccupation by creat-
ing the character of a Southerner
raised in a rural community and by
having him tell of his experiences as
a small boy in the first person.

The locality in which Look Away,
Look Away is set is a fictitious town
in East Texas. The town, Clarkville,

 

Lukacs Discusses

Cold Warfare

John Lukacs, a leading authority
on Eastern Europe, the Cold War,
and publie opinion, will speak at
Washington and Lee University
Thursday, January 16, on the sub-
ject, “From Cold War to Cold
Peace—the End of Ideology?

Appearing under the auspices of
the Department of Journalism and
Communications, Lukacs will address
the class in Psychological Warfare
and Propaganda, in which one of
his books, “A History of the Cold
War,” has been required reading.
The class meets at 11:10 a.m. in the
Journalism Lecture Room, Payne
Hall 6. The meeting is open to the
public.

Lukaes, who has degrees from
Cambridge and Budapest universi-
ties ,has been professor of history
at Chestnut Hill College, Philadel-
phia, since 1947; visiting professor at
La Salle College since 1949; visiting
professor, Columbia University, 1954-
55; Honors’ Examiner at Swarthmore
College, 1963; and will be visiting
professor at the University of Penn-
sylvania in 1964.

His three published books are
“The Great Powers and Eastern
Europe,” an edition of Tocqueville’s
papers, and a “History of the Cold
War,” which has also appeared in
German, French, Spanish, and Ital-
ian translations. Two new books,
“Historical Thinking,” and “The
Question of Europe,” will appear in
1964. He is the author of numerous
articles published in American and
English historical and literary jour-
nals, including “Poker and Amer-
ican Character” in the current issue
of Horizon magazine.

Lukaes was born in Hungary and
came to the United States in 1946.

his son in a remodeled old school-'

house in Chester County, Pa.

is in a region where the land and
climate make it a part of the South
rather than the West. Clarksville is
a typical Southern county seat, with
its locally impressive courthouse, set
in a square in the center of town,
and surmounted by a statue of a
Confederate soldier.

“Graveworking Day”

The narrator talks of himself as a
small boy growing up in this small
Southern town and of the annual
family reunions on “graveworking
day.” Customarily, this is the day
when all the clan gathers to tend
the ancestral graves and reverently
recount cherished anecdotes of its
deceased ancestors. In the narrator’s
family, long dead predecessors are
kept alive in spirit in the memories
of their living successors. The nar-
rator repeats the stories, good and
bad, with great devotion and pride
even for those ancient relatives that
he never knew.

Identity With the Past

In this attachment to forefathers
and kin lies the explanation for the
chronological backwardness of the
South, contended Mr. Humphrey in
summary. “We Southerners are ac-
cused of living in the past—What
can we do? The past lives in us.”
The influence of ancestors prevails
with Southerners because they have

 

an innate feeling of identity with

their dead. This sense of identity is
the source of most of the distinctly
Southern characteristics: legalism,
disrespect for the law (which is
imposed by a conqueror), resistence
to change, veneration of old age, re-
ligious feelings, ties of kinship, etc.

Civil War Still Vital

The war Between the States still
has a vital and vivid meaning to
the Southerner, says Mr. Humprey.
The Southerner is conscious of the
fact that the blood flowing in his
veins is the same blood that was
spilled at Shiloh. He thinks of the
Battle of Bull Run not in terms of
a great Southern victory but in
terms of the place where his great-
grandfather fought.

War For the Dead?

According to Mr. Humphrey, the
average Southerner went to war in
1861 not for a cause, as did the
Notherner, but for the few acres of
land constituting the resting place
of the family dead. He did not fight
to preserve slavery, which he de-
spised, or for his country, which
was only a few months old and a
“union of disunion.”

Mr. Humphrey’s narrative style is
gripping and brilliant. The reader is
quickly led to identify with the nar-
rator, and the series of anecdotes
is fascinating in the characters they
portray.

 

This winter’s Fancy Dress Ball
promises to be one of the gayest and
most colorful in recent years, due to
the Mardi Gras theme and the ap-
pearance of Stan Rubin’s dance or-
chestra and the two gospel singing
groups: the Grandison Singers and
the Sweet Chariot Singers.

The Ball has always been a cos-
tume affair, and this one will be no
exception. Although the number of
costumes sold to date is low, many
students are expected to make their
own. This originality is encouraged,
provided that the costumes are com-
patable with the formal ballroom at-
mosphere of the dance, but the dance
officials wish to stress that the set-
ting is not that of a street dance,
and that sloppy or overly suggestive
costumes will not be permitted, nor
will tuxedoes, but that full dress
(white tie and tails) will be accept-
able in the old tradition of the Mardi
Gras Ball, one of the most formal
social events in the South.

Steve Hibbard, Vice-president of
the Dance Board, has announced
that costumes, including full dress,
will be on sale for the last time on
Monday, January 13, from 9:30 to
5:00, except during the lunch hour,

 

 

The price of a single costume is $8, |
and a pair for a student and his date |
will cost $14.

These prices represent a_ saving |
of over $4 from last year, and|

i that many of them will also be in|

which the two gospel groups will

Gaines Dies

At 71; Last Rites
Held In Chapel

By STEVE BRAUER
Dr. Francis Pendleton Gaines, Chancellor and past presi-
dent of Washington and Lee University, died of an apparent
heart attack at his home December 31. Exactly two weeks
prior to his death, Dr. Gaines addressed the student body at an
ODK Tap Day ceremony where he received standing ovations

 

Scholarship Aids
Hit Record High

The amount of financial aid Wash-
ington and Lee University awards
undergraduates has climbed to a new
high in the current 1963-64 session.

Dean Lewis John, Director of Fi-
nancial Aid at Washington and Lee,
reports 246 students are receiving
$191,365 in assistance.

This total compares with $154,119
awarded 200 students in the 1960-61
session—the first year of the univer-
sity’s expanded financial aid pro-
gram whose purpose is to make
Washington and Lee education avail-
able to all qualified high school stu-
dents, regardless of their financial
limitations.

The program gives assistance in
the form of a scholarship, loan,
campus job or any combination of
the three. Dean John says a majority
of students receiving aid this year
are being helped through a scholar-
ship-loan combination.

Repayment of loans does not begin
until a student graduates, enabling
him to pay part of the cost of his
college education when his earning
power is established. All loans are
from university sources.

Washington and Lee students also
earn part of the expense of their
education through campus jobs as
dining hall workers, dormitory
counselors or helpers in the office
of academic departments and ad-
ministration officials.

The two top financial aid awards
Washington and Lee gives are the
George F. Baker Scholarships and
the Robert E. Lee Scholarships.

Dates From 1960

A gift from the George F. Baker
Trust of New York City established
the Baker Scholarships at Washing-
ton and Lee in 1960. In the current
sesison, six freshmen and 10 upper-
classmen are sharing $16,800.

The Robert E. Lee Scholarship
Fund was established in 1955 with
a $200,000 gift from an anonymous
donor. Including four freshmen, a
total of 21 undergraduates are re-
ceiving $13,600 from the fund this
year.

Financial aid given by Washing-
ton and Lee is awarded on the basis
of merit and need. In considering a
student for financial assistance, Dean
John says a boy’s academic record
and potential for development are
considered along with his need for
assistance in meeting expenses.

The actual amount of aid given
is determined by procedures adopted
by 516 institutions participating in
the College Scholarship Service. This
includes consideration of a family’s
income, assets, number of depen-
dents, debts and all unusual ex-
penses.

Gaines’ Education

Dr. Gaines’ career as the outstand-
ing Southern educator, orator, and
scholar of his day began in Due
West, South Carolina, where Dr.
Gaines was born on April 21, 1892,
the son of a Baptist minister. Fol-
lowing his graduation from Fork
Union Military Academy in 1909, he
received his A.B. from the Univer-
sity of Richmond, his A.M. from
the University of Chicago and his
Ph.D. from Columbia University.

At Mississippi State College, where
Dr. Gaines was a professor of Eng-
lish, he met and married Miss Sadie
duVergne Robert, the daughter of
the dean. In 1927, following pro-
fessorships at Furman and the Uni-
versity of Virginia, he became pres-
ident of Wake Forest College. Three
years later, he assumed the presi-
dency of Washington and Lee at
the age of 38.

Presidency of W&L

During the 29 years that Dr.
Gaines spent as president of W&L,
the University’s assets grew from
$3,290,000 to over $16,000,000 and the
alumni fund from $3,750 to $100,000.
Financial achievements were but a
small part of Dr. Gaines’ additions
to the University. Tucker Hall, Mc-
Cormick Library, the Student Union
Building, and duPont Hall were all
added during his tenure. During his
retirement Dr. Gaines spearheaded
the campaign to raise $2,000,000 for
new science and journalism facilities
for the University.

A non-subsidized athletic program,
which has become highly successful,
was put into effect during Dr.
Gaines’ administration.

State and National Positions

Outside of the University, Dr.
Gaines held positions of great im-
portance in state and national edu-
cation. He was president of the
Southern University Conference in
1939-1940 and president of the Asso-
ciation of American Colleges in 1944-
45. As well, Dr. Gaines headed the
Virginia Foundation for Independent
Colleges from its foundation in
1953 until 1955. In 1957 he was
awarded jury chairman of the Free-
dom Foundation in Valley Forge,
Penn. From 1941 to 1959 he was
chairman of the Virginia State Com-
mittee for War Bonds for which he
was decorated by Great Britain with
the King’s Medal for Services.

Dr. Gaines was also a trustee of
the Carnegie Foundation for Inter-
national peace from 1931 to 1951, and
held the chairmanships of the Fed-
eral Emergency Relief Administra-
tion for Virginia and the Virginia
State Planning Board.

As a writer, Dr. Gaines enjoyed
considerable success with his two
major works, Lee — The Final
Achievement, an account of Gen-
eral Lee’s accomplishments as pres-
ident of Washington College, and
The Southern Plantation.

Dr. Gaines received honorary de-
grees from fifteen colleges and uni-
versities, including Duke, Baylor,
the University of North Carolina,
Washington and Lee, and the Uni-
versity of the South.

Surviving Dr. Gaines are his wife,
Mrs. Sadie duVergne Robert Gaines;
three sons: Dr. Francis P. Gaines, Jr.
and Dr. Edwin Metcalf Gaines, both
of Tuscon, Arizona, and William R.
Gaines, New York; and seven grand-
children.

Funeral Services were held in Lee
Chapel Friday, January 31, at eleven
o clock.

Dr. Gaines: He Rode With Lee

The following editorial, written shortly after Dr. Gaines death
is reprinted from the Ledger-Star (Norfolk).

 

His first public recitation, we are told, was ‘The Sword
of Lee,” delivered at Memorial Day services at Wytheville
cemetary when he was only seven. Dead now, three score and
four years later, his life demonstrates the significance in this.

For Dr. Francis Pendleton Gaines, president of Washing-
ton and Lee University for 29 years until his retirement in
1959, made General Lee his personal hero, the Civil War a
subject of his research, and the school at Lexington and its im-
provement his career, and his success owes, in large part, to
the oratorical skills that he began developing that morning at

Wytheville.

Fairly short of stature, he was stocky and his jaw was
squared-off and heavy, like a reference book. His silver hair,
and thick hand that would swing through the air to emphasize a
point, added authority to what he had to say As a politician, he
would have been, perhaps, of the Bryan mold; as a preacher,
probably a Sockman or Fosdick; as an entertainer, the Will
Rogers type, intelligent and full of good humor. As an educa-
tor, Dr. Gaines himself set the pattern. A university president,
he was no ivory-tower scholar; he was not even mainly an
administrator. He became education’s emissary to the outside
world, pleading for its larger, voluntary support.

He spoke of the ‘“‘new seriousness” in American education
and abolished heavily-subsidized athletics at Washington and
Lee. He stressed the importance of a top faculty and recruited
more holders of the doctoral degree for Washington and Lee
than any other school of comparable size but one; he won
salary increases for his faculty and saw national polls rank
Washington and Lee among the top ten small men’s colleges
in the nation. One of his last services was to lead a fund drive
for an improved physical plant.

When he was inaugurated president in 1930, Washington
and Lee’s assets totaled $3 million and at his retirement they
came to $16 million. Alumni giving had increased from
$3000 annually to more than $100,000 and the school’s en-
dowment had increased ten fold.

But more important even than this spectacular record for
Washington and Lee, was the trend which Dr. Gaines helped
set for voluntary business support of private colleges. His in-
fluence here was tremendous, especially in Virginia through
the Virginia Foundation for Independent Colleges, but else-
where through the country as well.

In his Lee—The Final Achievement Dr. Gaines tells of
the General’s last five years, how he rejected lucrative busi-
ness offers to take over a small college named for Washington,
a man whom he immensely admired, its candle nearly snuffed
out by the Civil War, how he understood that education would
be one of the South’s most pressing needs in the difficult years
ahead and how he set out to build a really fine school.

Although the contributions of both General Lee and Dr.
Gaines extend beyond the university, the educator would prob-
ably consider it his highest tribute if he were recognized as hav-
ing helped the General achieve this goal. If so, the tribute be-
longs to him.

He Saw In Washington & Lee An Ideal

By LARRY MEEKS

(Editor’s note: The following
article, compiled from AP news
releases and University files is a
review of Dr. Gaines’ career, a
career that has earned recognition
for him as one of Virginia’s great-
est educators and one of the lead-
ing educators of the South. This
page is dedicated to the memory
of Dr. Gaines and is especially
written for those students that
enrolled at W&L since his retire-
ment from the presidency and
had only a limited contact with
him.)

Dr. Francis P. Gaines served for
29 years as president of Washington
and Lee, and during that time his
attitude toward the purposes of a
university changed little from the
statement he made during his in-
augural assembly held in Lee Chapel
in October of 1930. At that time, he
said, “To think of Washington and
Lee is to believe in an ideal...To
think of this ideal is to believe that
still it has power...Its power is...
to deposit in the life of a boy some-
thing a little finer than culture, a
little rarer than competence, a little
nobler than success; to quicken a
dream in the young brain... to fur-
nish young personality with potency
and poise.”

most of his boyhood near Wythe-
ville. In 1909 he graduated from Fork

Born the son of a Baptist minister

 

 

Dr. Gaines in his Washington Hall office shortly before his retirement

 

received his A.M. degree from the
University of Chicago two years lat-
er, and in 1924, he received his Ph.D.
degree from Columbia University.

After one year as principal of the
Green Bay (Va.) High School, he ac-
cepted a position at Mississippi State.
There he met and married Miss Sadie
duVergne Robert, the daughter of
the dean. Before becoming president
of Wake Forest in 1927, Dr. Gaines
held professorships at Furman Uni-
versity and at the University of
Virginia.

In 1930, Dr. Gaines became presi-
dent of Washington and Lee. Shortly
after his inauguration he told a stu-
dent reporter, “I want to live just as
close to the students as I can, and
I'm going to get into every activity
in which they'll have me.” During
his years here he tried to main-
tain this close contact, but the
changing role of the college presi-
dent prevented him from being as
close to the students as he would
have liked to be.

President’s Duties

In an interview at the time of his
retirement he recalled, “When I came
here the administrative staff consist-
ed of only the president, the dean,
the treasurer, and the registrar. With
the dean, I was the admissions com-
mittee, the discipline committee, to

S speeches Stressed Character

(Editor’s note: During his career, Dr. Gaines earned a reputation
as an outstanding and eloquent orator. Below are printed several excerpts
from speeches over the years.)

Youth and the Modern World

If I had mastery of the pictorial art of contrast, a touch of the talent
of Velasques, I should attempt a painting to be called “The Horizon of
Tomorrow.” The entire background would be heavy, black skies; against
that background would be the face of an American youth; and the face
would be full of fight.

* EJ *

The phase of character is the primary duty of all agencies that endeavor
to prepare youth. It should be the sacrificial concern of the home, the
ultimate procedure of the school, the heavenly interpretation of the
church, I confess to little sympathy with any home life or school program
that seeks a detour around the disciplines, the hardships, even the severity
from which great character is perfected. The modern world invites youth to
a nobler purpose, born of the very difficulties of our age. That youth
must know the full assurance of those who have achieved a “contempt
for softness.”

* * ok

We must tell these young people again how great is the heritage we
have brought them, how easily they may toss it aside. It is the heritage
of the moral concept, first delivered on Sinai, then enlarged and made
beautiful on the immortal mount of the sermon by Christ; it is the heritage
of the Athenian culture, the deathless dream of beauty; it is the heritage
of the Romans who, after bloody blundering, came to a crystallization
in the legal codes of Justinian; it is the heritage of the Anglo-Saxon faith
and daring in behalf of personal liberty, from Magna Carta to the Declara-
tion of Independence. The summations of all that is best in human history
we offer this young generation, to preserve or, if they will, to despoil.

How great is that heritage! How imperative the responsibility of these
legacies! How incalculable the loss if they be neglected! How command-
ing is the obligation of the centuries!

“Follow Your Patron Saints”

There is another verse in St. Pau! that I commend to you, gentlemen.

 

Development and Heritage

I see it sometimes as though it were on a parchment and a strange and
holy light behind it. I know of no verse on earth that could be more
significant to you. St. Paul says “Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever
things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of
good report,’—what about these?—“think of these things.” Pick your minds
up and put them on these things. You can do that; no one else can do it for
you, but you can get help.

Not long after I got here a man made a little speech. He said a very
simple thing, and it didn’t tremendously impress me at the time. And yet
across the years, I’ve realized that I haven’t heard a much more inspiring
suggestion. He said that somewhere in England, in the British Isles there
is a college with an entrance arch, and on that entrance arch, there were
four words engraved, or inscribed. And those four words were simply
these: “Follow your patron saints.” And then he said that if there is a
college in the world in which young men should heed that advice, it’s
Washington and Lee.

Follow your patron saints, and you will find the true and honest and the
just and the pure and the lovely. Follow them not merely because they
are notable figures in history. Remember that each one of them had his
moments like yours. Perhaps the greatness of Washington is at Valley
Forge, and the majesty of Lee is at Appomattox, but they went through
their Valley Forges and their Appomattoxes controlling always their own
thinking. They went through it and found, as I pray you will find, the
God who was their strength and their reward.

“The Stream of Consciousness”

It flows like a river, sometimes tranquilly when you lie on the campus
in the spring and watch the Lexington dogs, and sometimes when a prob-
lem has disturbed you it churns up furiously, but it flows. It’s subject to
strange emotional tributaries; like a river, particularly subject. You are
thinking of nothing in the world and you look upon an unhappy picture,
and your stream of consciousness is muddied and you wish you hadn't
seen that picture. I walked down a street not so long ago, this spring,
and from some shrub I could not see, I got the fragrance of lilacs, and 60
years were gone, and I was back in my mother’s little garden and she was
saying to me, “Son, the 21st of April is your birthday, and I hope the
lilacs are in bloom by that day.” I hope they bloom in eternity.

 

 

Here he is making his final speech, an address to the ODK assembly
on December 2 on “Credentials for Leadership.” (Borthwick)

He is pictured here with Dr. Cole shortly before his retirement after
29 years as W&L president.

The Generals have a record of 40-
31-2 in previous games against next
year’s opponents. As for 1964, Coach
Lee McLaughlin says, “We’re faced

Kem White (top) wrestles Dick
Musick in practice.

Miller said of the team’s 3-1 rec-
ord, “I think we’re wrestling up to
our capabilities. Some of the teams
we beat badly last year are greatly
improved.”

The wrestlers have beaten North
Carolina (16-14), Oneonta Teachers
(19-13), and Hartwick College (21-
8).

Musick is the only man still un-
beaten. The freshman has a 3-0-1
record, with two pins. Stover, at 3-1,
is the only other wrestler over the
.500 mark.

Speaking of the .500 mark, Wash-
ington and Lee’s basketball team will
be trying to get past that obstacle
for the first time this season. They
will meet Richmond Professional
Institute in Richmond.

The Generals, who defeated Penn-
sylvania Military College, 75-48, in
their final game before Christmas,
carry a 3-3 slate into the contest.

Coach Bob McHenry says of RPI,
who is 3-7, that “despite its record,
RPI is a good club. It has a pair
of top notch performers in C. G.
Winston and George Shaheen.”

Winston and Shaheen led the Rams

(Games through Wednesday)

As tournament time approaches in
basketball this week, Bob Stauffer
and Andy Kilpatrick scored 30 points
between them, led a strong PiKA
squad to a 53-33 victory over an
aggressive but cold-shooting Phi Psi
outfit. Beta looked like a winner in
their league, Bob Lohman pacing
them to victory over NFU,45-22.
Lohman scored 22 points to tie for
the week’s scoring honors. Beta must
beat only SPE (1-1) next week to
gain a spot in the finals.

SAE met their strongest challenge
yet Wednesday night against Delt.
For a change, a referee (namely
Robin Kell) called fouls, and four
foul shots by Henry Sackett late in
the first half enabled SAE to take a
two-point lead at the break. Sackett

_| closed with 19 points, as SAE pulled
-| away in the second half to win, 46-
i | 33.

In other games, Lambda Chi took
the lead from Phi Delt with five
minutes to play, hung on to win a
thriller, 40-35. Phi Delt had earlier
forfeited to SPE. Kappa Sig defeated
Phi Kap 49-33 despite Kiah Ford’s

-|22-point contribution to a losing

cause. With Mike Bowerman scor-
ing 18, Delt preceded their loss to
SAE with a 53-25 victory over Sig-
ma Chi. DU gained a forfeit win over
KA.

The best: 1. SAE, 3-0, 2. Sigma
Nu, 3-0; 3. PiKA, 3-0.

Phi Gam extended their unbeaten
string to three in wrestling by beat-
ing Pi Phi, 23-13. Phi Gam was far
enough ahead after six matches to
forfeit the last two weight classes,
otherwise lost only one decision. For
Pi Phi, it was their second loss of
the week—they had earlier been
beaten by SAE, 20-15.

KA needed five pins to stave off
SPE, 25-15, and extend their record
to 4-0. Undefeated in their league,
KA has clinched a playoff spot. Beta
also earned the finals when they

defeated PiKA, 23-10. The match
gave Beta a 2-0-1 record against
PiKA’s 2-1.

The best: 1. Phi Gam, 3-0; 2. KA,
4-0; 3. Delt, 2-1.

The top three in bowling all ex-
tended unbeaten records this week.
Kappa Sig did it without picking

fourth in a row. SAE had it tougher,
needed twin 199 games by Fred
Ridolphi and Dick Musick to fight
off a surprising NFU squad, 2335 pins
to 2227.

Craig Blackstock bowled high
game of the week, a 245, for Sigma
Chi, but to no avail as defending
champion Phi Kap swept to a 4-0
victory. All three victors have un-
beaten opponents yet to face—ZBT
(1-0) for Phi Kap, Beta (2-0) for
Kappa Sig, and Phi Delt (1-0) for
SAE. The fourth championship will
probably be decided next week when
Pi Phi (3-0) faces Phi Psi (2-0)

The best: 1. Pi Kap, 3-0; 2. SAE,
3-0; 3. Kappa Sig, 3-0.

A busy week of handball saw KA
and Delt continue their winning
ways. KA crushed Phi Kap, forfeit
victor over Law earlier in the week,
by a score of 5-0. Johnny McDaniels
led Delt to a 4-1 win over Pi Phi,
loser also to Kappa Sig by the same
ssore. Sigma Nu took two, 4-1 over
ZBT, and 3-2 over Phi Gam. PEP
did likewise, beating DU 3-2 and
NFU by a forfeit to close out a
winning 3-1 season.

The best: 1. Beta, 2-0; 2. Delt,
3-0; 3. KA, 3-0.

By GUY UNANGST
Friday Sports Editor

Beta or Delt will win the intra-
mural handball championship this
year.

Beta is defending school champion.
Neither they nor Delt has as yet
been beaten, and neither will be,
except by the other.

In 1958, a team of faculty members
won the handball championship. As
of 1959, they no longer entered a
team. The reason—the fraternities’
loss of the championship trophy.

Article IV, section E of the Consti-
tution and By-Laws of the Depart-
ment of Intramural Athletics, as
published in the present (1960) edi-
tion of The Guide to Intramural
Athletics at Washington and Lee,
states: “The Faculty Club may enter
a team in any intramural sport pro-
vided the two-thirds of the frater-
nity representatives do not object
at the orientation meeting of the
sport.”

The faculty did not make the
handball schedule in 1959, because
the fraternities chose to invoke the
“two-thirds” rule.

Frank A. Parsons, at that time the
Faculty Handball Manager, para-
phrased the rule—“The faculty can
participate, as long as it doesn’t win.”
He said that to his knowledge Phi
Psi was the only fraternity to vote
in favor of allowing the faculty to
play. Phi Psi finished second to the
faculty in 1958,

In a letter to the Ring-tum Phi
at the time of the blackball, Par-
sons said, “The faculty bowling team
was also challenged, but when it was
learned that this team was no threat
to the championship, its participation

was condoned, even welcomed.”

The Washington Post and Times-
Herald ran a story on the ruling,
headlining it, “If You Can’t Beat
‘Em, Ban Them.” The Ring-tum Phi
ran an editorial, saying, “The stu-
dents have certainly demonstrated
that they are poor losers,”

The faculty handball team swept
through the regular 1958 season and
the playoffs without a loss. They lost
but one individual match, and that
in the finals with a professor who
had never before played handball.
They lost perhaps half a dozen in-
dividual games.

Coach Dick Miller said, “I don’t
think any one fraternity has the
men to beat the faculty.” He cited
Norm Lord and Joe Lyles as the best
in the athletic department.

Parsons said the faculty is “eager
to play any time the fraternities
are willing.” He said the faculty
would even be willing to play an
all-star team—for the handball
trophy. The best outside the gym—
President Fred C. Cole, accounting
professor Jay Cook, geology profes-
sor Ed Spencer, Dean Ed Atwood,
proctor Bob Murray, and Parsons.

Perhaps the fraternities are ready
now to place the handball trophy
on the line. Delt athletic manager
Gordon Gay says, “If the Delt
team wins the intramural champion-
ship, we would be happy to meet
the best of the faculty.”

The Generals, victims of a chal-

lenging schedule, hold a 2-2 record.
One of these victories cames over
powerful Loyola of Baltimore in
what coach Eastman terms a “pleas-
ant surprise.”
Bruce Houghton, the team’s div-
ing specialist, leads the squad in
total points followed closely by Brad
Taylor, a freshman sprinter. Diving
and breast stroke must be consid-
ered the Generals’ best events. Co-
captain Jim Wallenstein and Skip

Dr. Gaines: He Saw An Ideal

(Continued from page 2)

mittee, and what today we call the
development committee.” In these
varied capacities he was indeed con-
nected with every phase of the col-
lege’s activity, but through the
years, the widening responsibilities
of a college president began to take
him away from the everyday busi-
ness of ee and Lee.

In his words, “I think the presi-
dent’s duties eed when the
college recognized its need for varied
and generous cooperation from those
other than its immediate family. It
became necessary to take the cole
lege to the supporting publics, not
wait for them to come to it.”

Accomplishment

During his administration he
helped build an excellent faculty,
and among schools of comparable
size and general academic charac-
ter, only one college can list more
professors with Ph.D. degrees, a
study taken near the time of his re-
tirement showed.

Three years before he retired, a

| nationwide survey of educators, con- |

ducted by the Chicago Tribune,
ranked Washington and Lee as one
of the ten best men’s colleges in the
United States.

Also under Dr. Gaines’ direction,
the physical plant of the university
was enlarged quite considerably. The
additions include Tucker Hall, Mc-
Cormick Library, an enlarged facil-
ity using the shell of the old Car-
negie Library for its stack area, a
new student union building, and du-
Pont Hall. The month of his resig-

nation the new dining hall, Baker
and Davis dormitories and the sup-
ply store were put into service.

There were also times of crisis and
difficulty during his years here.
There were the days of World War
II in which he faced the prospect
of a college with empty classrooms,
but he saw a way out and wrote,
“To the government, we do not say
‘Save the colleges.’ Rather we say
‘Use the colleges’.”

The government did use the col-
leges and from 1942 to 1946, Wash-
ington and Lee was home to the
Army School for Special Services,
and more than 25,000 army per-
sonnel attended the _ specialized
courses offered here.

Athletics

Dr.
the battle in the cause of non-sub-
sidized athletics. When the college
elected to abandon a big-time foot-
ball program in 1954, there were
threats of non-support from im-
portant alumni groups and predic-
tions of ruin for Washington and
Lee. Under President Gaines’ lead-
ership, however, the college cham-
pioned a cause aimed at placing
sports in proper perspective for a
small, liberal arts college.

“No man could ask for a finer privi-

single disappointment, except in my
own performance. I have only hap-
py and grateful feelings for all those
who have supported me—the trus-
tees, the faculty, my staff, the stu-
dents, and many other good friends
of this university.”

Shortly after his retirement, Dr.
Gaines was made chancellor of the
University and he retained this post
until his death December 31. Fun-
eral services were held for him in
Lee Chapel where he was inaugu-
rated as W&L president and where

Tour Continent
For Only $269

Sabena Belgian World Airlines in|
cooperation with Arthur Frommer’s |
“$5-A-Day Tours, Inc.,” has worked
out a European tour program for |
students which features 30-day bus.
tours of Europe and the continent for
$269 plus cost of the air fare. |

Frommer, author of the best-sell- |
ing pocket book, “Europe on Five
Dollars A Day,” has set up the tours
to take advantage of a new vehicle |
known as the “Minibus” which seats
groups of 12 or 21. The “Minibus” |
carries camping equipment including |
tents; sleeping bags; stoves; air mat- |
tresses; cooking and eating utensils. |

Leisurely Pace |

“Student travelers only have to
bring clothing and personal sup-
plies,” Frommer said. “The tours will
cover ground at a very leisurely
pace with never more than five

‘hours on the road in a single day.

More important points will be given
comparatively more time. And, each
group will have a_ professional
guide,” he added.

Designed primarily for American
students of 17 to 25 years of age,
the tours starting April 1 will de-
part at two-week intervals through
September 15. In addition, two 30-
day itineraries can be combined and
the 60-day rate comes to $509. One
tour covers Belgium, Holland, Ger-
many, Austria, Switzerland, and
Italy ending up in Rome. The second
tour starts in Rome and covers ma-
jor points in France, Andorra, Spain,
back to France, Belgium and Eng-
land.

Occasional Hotel Stops

Mixed in with the camping will
be occasional stops at hotels and
restaurants. Eleven or more students
may work out their own itinerary if
they choose and leave from Brussels
at any time for approximately nine
dollars a day. Moreover any campus
eager beaver can pick up a free
ticket by booking 15 other students
and all they pay is the regular fare
(or get 10 students at regular fare
and pay half fare.

Details may be obtained through
the Publicity Department, Sabena
World Airlines, Sabena Building,
New York.

 

Notice

Calyx Queen Contest

For some reason the response to
the notice of the Calyx queen con-
test has been quite limited. Less than
10 pictures have been entered. All
students interested in entering the
contest are therefore urged to notify
Syd butler, SAE, or Dick Coplan,
ZBT, at once.

Photos should be black and white,
and of sufficient size and quality.
With very few entries to date, the
chanees of having your picture
printed are much greater, for in
addition to the Calyx queen, six to
eight other girls are selected in the
Calyx Court. Pictures are guaranteed
to be returned in the same condition
as they are received. The deadline
for turning in photos is January 15.

College President Advocates
Five-Year College Program

The undergraduate program in col-
leges of arts and sciences should be
extended to five years and special-
ization by “majors” in these colleges
should be dropped, where possible,
Dr. Francis H. Horn, University of
Rhode Island president, stated re-
cently.

The job of bringing “more wisdom
into the affairs of man and of na-
tions” and in coping with the explo-
sion of knowledge can “no longer be
done ...in the traditional four years,
increasingly being compressed into
three,” he said. Claiming that he
was “not so naive to discount the
importance of specialized knowledge
and professional preparation,” Dr.
Horn said, that nevertheless society’s
need for breadth of knowledge, criti-
cal judgment, and power to reason
are just as significant.

While suggesting that “as much
specialization as posisble be post-
poned to the graduate school, he
also decried the tendency “to mold
the college of arts and sciences in-

 

to a lower-level copy of the grad-
uate school.”

The impetus to re-shape the col-
lege of arts and sciences, he declared,
will not come from the faculty of
this college, since its members con-
stitute a stronghold of conservatism
and are resistant to change. “Real
educational reform will depend upon
the sort of leadership academic ad-
ministrators—deans and presidents—
give to the task,” he added.

After noting that colleges of arts
and sciences will be called upon
to accommodate the largest per-
centage of the booming student
population, Dr. Horn said there is
a trend “to separate sciences from
the humanities and the social sci-
ences.”

If an actual separation does not
take place, some sort of division will
probably be developed to handle
“administrative problems of such a
large segment of the student body
and faculty.”

Fan Mail Slows
‘Humour’ Mag:
Preview Of FD

Progress to date on the anticipated
Fancy Dress Issue of The Southern
Collegian could be measured in an
eye-dropper. Tain Tompkins, Edi-
tor of the humor magazine, claims
his staff has been delayed in its
work because it has had to spend
so much time answering its mail
as a result of the first issue.

This mail comes in two major
categories, according to Tompkins.
One category is the mail demand-
ing that the magazine be banned
from publication. The other cate-
gory is that mail requesting sub-
scription blanks. So far the letters
asking that the magazine be ban-
ned are in the lead, 1 to 0.

At this time, several articles are
ready to be set. One of these is a
donation from Hollins College en-
titled “Guide To Blind Dating at
W&L.” Tompkins has no comment
on it at this time. The issue will
feature a prep sheet for English
comprehensive examinations. A few
parodies of well-known English
bards can be expected in this sec-
tion.

The photographers moved a little
further west this issue (last time
they only got as far as Buena Vis-
ta), and took some shots of Sweet
Briar’s offerings. In addition to
the photography, the usual crea-
tive art work can be expected.

Last but not least, the Collegian
intends to feature its advertisements.
The usual ones will be available for
perusal, in addition to—perhaps—a
Homestead ad.

 

Combos Signed

over the Fancy Dress Weekend. Such
popuar entertaining groups as the
Delacardos, Maurice Williams and
the Zodiacs, Martha and the Van-
dellas, Dr. Feelgood and the Interns,
and The Thornton Sisters will be on
campus .Following is a complete list-
ing.

of Fancy Dress weekend.

Dakota, “one of the most dynamic
new personalities to have joined the
ranks of top commercial jazz artists,”
has just completed a cross-country
tour including appearances at Car-
negie Hall, the Copa Club, and the
Newport Jazz Festival.

Although the concert is usually
held on Saturday evening, Croft
cited two reasons for the after-
noon scheduling. “An afternoon
convert creates a more receptive
audience for a sophisticated artist
like Dakota Staton, while it gives
fraternities a completely free eve-
ning for combo parties.” The
Dance Board also announced that
conventional dress will be worn at
the concert.

Miss Staton’s distinctive vocal
stylings are sometimes blues—like
with an unusual misty quality, some-
times swinging with a light, refresh-
ing beat. In each performance the
Staton sound reputedly creates new
meaning for familiar lyrics, turning
old favorite into “fresh and exciting
musical experiences.”

Miss Staton was born in Pitts-
burg, Pennsylvania, June, 1931
and began her career at seven,
singing with two sisters. When her
sisters married and the trio dis-
solved, she went on as a “single”
attending high school by day and
performing in a Pittsburgh night
club in the evenings. This was the
beginning of a long series of night
club engagements, theatre dates,
and cross-country concert tours.
To mention but a few, she has ap-
peared at Basin Street East and
the Village Vanguard in New York,
and the New Frontier Hotel in Las
Vegas.

After securing a contract with
Capital Records, Miss Staton had
two hits with her first record “What
D’You Know About Love,” and “You
Are My Heart’s Delight,” and the
same year she received the Down
Beat Award for “The Most Promis-
ing Newcomer of the Year.” On her
first album, “The Late, Late Show,”
Miss Staton is accompanied by such
soloists as Hank Jones, piano, and
Jonah Jones, trumpet, and the back-
ground to this album was conceived
and conducted by Van Alexander
with an assist by Hank Jones.

Variety gave the following review
of Miss Staton. “In ballad and rhy-
thm, Miss Staton is in complete
charge of all values and has no
trouble getting the audience on her
side.” Besides her numerous club
engagements, she has performed on
many television shows including, The
Today Show and the Playboy Pent-
house Show.

 

Glee Club Makes Plans
For Coming Spring Tour

Jim Mell, president of the W&L
Glee Club, has announced that his
organization is planning a spring tour
this year in Philadelphia on March
6, 7, and 8.

Although exact engagements have
not yet all been confirmed for the
tour, Mell said last year’s Glee Club
traveled to Attlanta, Georgia, for
concerts at Agnes Scott Women’s
College, the Atlanta Veteran’s Hos-
pital, and the Atlanta Federal Prison.

Other Glee Club concerts an-
nounced by Mell are a joint Easter
concert to be given on the W&L
campus with Randolph-Macon Col-
lege and a concert on April 30 to
be held in conjunction with the
Southern Interscholastic Press As-
sociation Convention which will be
held at W&L.

The Value Of An Opinion
When Taken To The Poll

Quizzes and papers scheduled for this last week are
eating up everyone’s time, and with exams looming closer,
it’s hard to write editoriallk—and even harder than ever,
we suspect, to read them. So we'll be brief.

 

We have tried to demonstrate during this past semes-
ter that the Executive Committee operates too much of
the machinery which composes our student government.
It is executive, legislative, and judicial in its function. It
is a perfect example of the concentration of power in a
small group of people.

Our suggestion has been offered in the spirit of conser-
vatism—and if these suggestions have escaped you, rest
assured we shall present them in detail in the coming
months. Our questions are these: Should the responsibility
for judging accused honor violators be vested in a com-
mittee which has many other responsibilities (as is now
the case), or should this awesome task be the duty of one,
single committee—a Judiciary Council? Should the execu-
tive and legislative aspects of student government then be
made the business of a Student Senate? Would such a
governmental structure be better than the one we now
have? Is change, in short, really needed?

The answers rest with you, the W&L student. A
thousand editorials do not have the power of your opin-
ion and your vote. What we want most is that in the com-
ing semester you care—care enough to have an opinion,
to voice that opinion, and to take that opinion to the polls
should the opportunity arise.

Since this request of ours is indisputably aligned with
the American ideal, we fervently hope our critics will see
fit to relax their jaws and put down their quills during
the coming intermission.

Current Cinema
British Director Forbes
Succeeds With ‘L-Room’

By TOM PACE

“The L-shaped Room” is one of those rare films from which,
hopefully, one may learn. If it falls short of greatness, as it does, it
is simply because its writer-director, Bryan Forbes, is a less creative
and less experienced director than writer. For certainly the worthiest
aspect of the film is its story.

Leslie Caron is a 27-year-old French girl who has broken away
from her parents and come to London to claim her freedom. She
wastes little time. At a peaceful resort spot, somewhere in England,
she loses her now stale virginity. And becomes pregnant. And de-
cides she wants it. (It meaning the baby, not meaning to be harsh
towards the kid, but because that is the way the people in the movie
refer to it.

She moves into a low rent flat in a boarding house full of
what might be described as colorful characters: a Negro horn-
blower, a would-be but probably never will-be writer, a kindly
old woman who in her younger days was an entertainer, an
actress, and a lesbian; two whores, one very outgoing, the other
very ingoing; and a nasty landlady who has some man living
with her who I didn’t think was her husband.

Leslie attracts the young writer. After a rather persistent bit
of courting on his part, she becomes attracted to him. They fall
in love, or at least say they do. They sleep together. Then he learns
that she is pregnant. He rebukes her. Thy make up and he indicates
he would like her to get rid of it. A doctor assumes she wants to get
rid of it. The kindly old lady downstairs thinks she should get rid
of it. She wants to get rid of it. And, inevitably, she tries to do just
that.

Luckily, or unluckily, depending on how you think, she fails. She
and the writer become closer. Then, on Christmas morning, he tells
her that the love is gone, after she has given him his Christmas
present. She has the baby and it becomes a she. The writer visits
her in the hospital and gives her a story he has written about them.
She tells him she is going home. She returns his story and does go
home. The movie ends.

And this is indeed the way love (or its reasonable fac-
simile) so often is. There is a pleasant acquaintanceship, fol-
lowed by a period of passion, and then a realization that per-
haps this isn’t all it should be. Forbes seems to imply that re-
lationships are not simply hot or cold, but that they are often
warm. The writer was good for her because she needed some-
one during this lonely period of trial; and she for him because
he had just lost a girl with whom he says he was very much in
love. The film, because of this, might be judged a happy one.
Yet I would disagree. It is sad that their relationship must be-
come only a memory. It is sad that they are unwilling to try to
make it more than that. I think Forbes is making a statement
on the tragedy of human relationships. We must have it hot
or cold. When the heat loses its intensity, we have to let go
entirely.

What he says is true, and because of its truth it is a fine film.
Forbes has written an excellent screenplay. And he has got some
splendid performance. Leslie Caron received the British Academy
Award for her portrayal. Tom Bell, as the writer, deserves equal
credit. And the supporting players were all appropriately cast, and
each quite good in his or her role. Forbes and producer Richard
Attenbrough are a good pair and will doubtless make some fine
films in the future.

The Winter of Our Discontent, by
John Steinbeck. (Bantam, $ .75.)

In The Winter of Our Discontent,
John Steinbeck has written a confus-
ing story framed in the manner
of a modern tragedy: a man, all
alone, fighting his battle against de-
spair. Ethan Hawley is an idealist
who begins to change because he is
ashamed of his economic and social
circumstances. He wants Mary, his
wife, to be able to hold up her head
with pride. He wants to get a car
for his family, and he wants to own
a TV set. His own daughter, Ellen,
has hit him time and again with
the question: “When are we going
to be rich?”

Ethan is a clerk in a local grocery
store, and he himself must admit
that if it weren’t for the discount on
food which he received, his salary
wouldn’t cover the family expenses,
low as they were. Ethan’s son, Allen,
in his early teens, has already be-
come disillusioned with life; while
the father, Ethan, is an idealist, the
son, Allen, is comparatively world-
wise.

Battle for Idealism

The bulk of the novel centers on
Ethan’s inner conflict: should he
sacrifice his ideals and go through

with what seems a sure-fire plan to
get easy (and dishonest) money?
The more certain the plan becomes
in Ethan’s mind, the more inclined
he is to carry it through; at a crucial
moment, however, fate prevents him
from his plan, only to place him on
the road to another means to quick
cash. This second plan, easier than
the first, is more despicable, and thus
requires the sacrifice of even more
of Ethan’s fast-dwindling idealism.

In the meantime, Ethan’s son is
planning to enter the “I Love Amer-
ica” essay contest, in which he hopes
to pick up some easy money of his
own. Allen has no scruples about the
acquisition of wealth; he intends to
win the contest regardless of the
tactics he must employ to do so. In
the framework of Ethan fighting
against his ideals and Allen giving
such airy things no thought at all,
the two have a talk about money.
Ethan tries to explain to his son that
something-for-nothing is only a
myth, that “it doesn’t hurt the money
to get it that way but it hurts the
one who gets it.” Allen, callous and
calculating, becomes a foil to his
father by replying: “It’s all dough,
no matter how you get it.” Later
Allen wins the contest and Ethan

 
     

catches him rehearsing his accept-
ance speech in front of his mother’s
mirror with mascara on his eyes.

“Well, when the bunting and tin-
sel come down, I’m going to need
your help.’”

“How do you mean?’”

“‘T told you before, to help me in
the store.’”

“IT couldn’t do that,’ he said, and
he inspected his teeth in the hand-
mirror.”

Completely repulsed by his son,
Ethan tells us: “I got out fast and
closed the door and in my bathroom
I ran the water cold and iced my
skin and let the cold penetrate deep
to control my shaking rage.”

Life or Death Climax

The novel builds toward a power-
ful climax involving life and death.
Ethan becomes convinced he is doing
no one much good. He is about to go
out for a walk one night when his
daughter rushes up to him and says:

“Take me with you.”

“Silly, I can’t. But if you will come
in the kitchen, I’ll wash your face.”

Ethan is torn between the convic-
tion that he is “carrying a light” for
his little daughter, and the defeating

Recent Student Poll Reveals...

 

Opinions on Student Government

By GARETH ADEN
Feature Editor

Due to an apparent interest in re-
forming the student government
which was shown before Christmas
by a number of students, the edi-
torial staff of the Tuesday Bdition
of The Ring-tum Phi decided at that
time to conduct a poll of student
opinion on the matter. The poll was
begun before Christmas, and it has
been completed in the past eight
days. While we do not claim the re-
sults as absolutely representative, we
have made every effort to be ob-
jective, and feel it reflects at least
a part of the opinion currently held
by students.

Questions were asked of one hun-
dred students who were divided al-
most equally among the four un-
dergraduate classes. Questions cen-
tered around a suggested re-shaping
of the student government into 1) a
Student Senate for legislative and
executive work and 2) an Honor
Council solely for the purpose of
trying honor violations. The propo-
sal was vague, and it was left that
way in order to get an unbiased
student opinion on their government.

66 Favor Change

In regard to the proposal that
student government here take the
form of a Senate and judicial board,
66 students favored it while 34 dis-
sented.

It is interesting to note the way
the polling went by classes: among

the seniors opinion was evenly di-
vided, while it was slightly in favor
of the proposal among the juniors.
However, in the sophomore and
freshman classes it was clearly in
favor of the proposed change.

It would be hard to determine
whether the split opinion in the sen-
ior class toward the proposal is a
sign of greater knowledge or merely
cynicism towards student govern-
ment.

EC Has Too Much Power

Those students who favored the
change gave various reasons, which
came down to about four main
points. First, most of them seemed to
feel that the Executive Committee
had too much power for so small a
body (12 men). As one student
graphically put it, “Let’s not put all
our eggs in one basket.” Others felt
that the EC had too much to do and
that, although it is an honor to be
elected to that committee, it may be
a liabiliy to one’s scholastic record.
There was a great deal of contradic-
tion as to how much EC members
actually have to do, however.

Many students felt that the stu-
dent government ought to be more
representative so as to give more
people a chance to take part in
student government and also to en-
sure better communication with the
student body. There was a general
feeling that W&L has many good
men who are not given a real chance
to participate in student government.

Finally, some people said they fav-
ored the proposal because they felt
that the jobs of judging honor cases
and legislating required two differ-
ent types of people, and should be
divided.

No Reason To Change

In true debating style, the stu-
dents who were not in favor of the
proposal argued that there was no
reason to change the present system.
Many seemed sure that there was
not that much work for EC mem-
bers to create a real burden. Some
said simply that the student gov-
ernment, they felt, had worked well
in the past under this set-up and
would continue to do so.

Upperclassmen especially felt that
a Student Senate, since it would be
larger than the EC, would be inef-
fective and sluggish in getting things
done. It would simply be “too big to
handle.” One student said he favored
leaving government in the hands of
the faily small EC because, “There
simply aren’t enough competent peo-
ple around to fill a larger group.”

Dissatisfied With EC

Rather surprisingly, many students
who were not in favor of the pro-
posed splitting of responsibility in
government when asked if they were
satisfied with the EC answered no.
One said that he was satisfied but
felt that the student government
could be much better. Some thought
the whole question was ridiculous

Former Student Reports on African Life
As a Member of the Peace Corps Team

Dear Dr. Colvin,

Merry Christmas! One year ago
I hardly thought I would be sending
you Christmas greetings from Africa;
but now that I am settled down
here, it doesn’t seem so strange after
all.

It all started last March when I
learned that I had been accepted by
the Peace Corps. After a ten-week
training program at Cornell Uni-
versity, where we learned every-
thing from Sierra Leone history to
how to deliver a baby, I and about
60 other Volunteers flew to Sierra
Leone and received our assignments.

Sierra Leone is a small country
on the southern coast of West
Africa. It was one of the first areas
in West Africa to be explored by
the Europeans and by the 18th
century, Sierra Leone was doing a
thriving business in the gold and
slave trade. After becoming a
British colony she developed
steadily and the country finally
gained its independence in 1961.
During the years Sierra Leone has
built up a fine road system, and she
takes particular pride in her edu-
cational system. Fourah Bay Col-
ledge, in the capital city of Free-
town, was the first educational
institution of its kind in West Afri-

ca and has often been called the
“Harvard of West Africa.”

I am presently living in a small
village called Jimmi Bagbo, This
quiet place of about 700 Sierra
Leoneons and five Peace Corps Vol-
unteers could’t have given us a
warmer welcome. The Peace Corps
is well respected in the community,
and we equally return this respect.
We have found the people willing
to participate in anything we have
planned and in like manner are
eager to join in their activities. This
mutual cooperation will be more
than idle words during the Christmas
holidays when the Peace Corps
Volunteers in Sierra Leone will work
with the people of Jimmi to build a
library for the town’s primary
school. Instead of finding the many
obstacles which have blocked the
way of Volunteers in other countries
and in Sierra Leone, we have found
it hard to keep up with the enthus-
iasm of the people we are working
with.

While all of this is enjoyable, I
still feel my main job here is to
teach. This I find interesting and
rewarding. I am teaching French
and history to about eighty-five
boys for twenty-one hours out of
the week. The rest of the time is

spent giving medical care to the
students, coaching a debating team
and various other duties.

Perhaps what has impressed me
most about the students is the ser-
iousness with which they regard
their education. To them an educa-
tion is a valuable possession and
not one to be lightly thought of. Of
course, not all of the students feel
this way, and I find the same range
of personalities that one might find
in school back home. However, one
of the most striking things is their
eagerness to learn about anything
now. In the last few weeks conver-
sations in and outside of class have
ranged over subjects such as com-
munications satellites, Berlin, Eng-
lish idioms, current fads and civil
rights.

As Christmas rolls around in Jim-
mi Bagbo, we don’t find Sauta Claus-
es, crowded department stores and
street decorations to remind us of
the season; but perhaps we here have
an even better reminder, a living re-
minder that a little understanding
can help to bring us closer to the
goal of peace on earth and good will
to men.

Merry Christmas and a Happy
New year|

‘Tun Squire:

By ADDISON BROCKENBROUGH

Following are scattered notes
made since the last column on De-
cember 17.

December 20, 1963
Friday

One of Washington and Lee’s most
interesting traditions is the stag
Christmas party, held ordinarily on
the night before everyone goes home.
The gifts usually involve some very
clever and well-worked-out atroci-
ties. The festivities include poems
composed in the spirit of brotherly
affection, and a revised sing of “The
Twelve Days of Christmas.”

This sort of activity often helps
to clear everyone’s addled brains—
with one exception last month. As a
fraternity man opened his formid-
able present, donated anonymously,
he found a very stiff, very dead
skunk.

January 9, 1964
Thursday

The incident of stealing from a
local store during the Thanksgiving
blackout has apparently been re-
solved—the store now claims an
older man, not a W&L student and
his wife, was responsible.

I defend my source for the original
report. The fact is that some towns-
people believed one month ago that
a W&L student had been involved
in the Thanksgiving thefts. It was
already a public matter before I
mentioned it in this column. I felt
that in order to clear the air, it
needed to be even more public. That
the original story has been shown as
untrue is something for which we
all can be grateful. Who started the
original story would be impossible
to determine. The important thing is
that what purported to be a stairi
on W&L has been erased... erased,
indeed, as a direct result of this
column.

January 10, 1964
Friday

Barry Goldwater’s candidacy has
stirred interest, but his refusal to
debate Governor Rockefeller is dis-
appointing. I agree with columnist
Roscoe Drummond, who points out
that Goldwater has twice accused

Cancellation Explained

Sir:

As president of the Student Lead-
ership Forum, and Chairman of its
Steering Committee, I feel I must
comment on the editorial which ap-
peared in the December 17th Tues-
day edition of the Ring-tum Phi.

I can not understand how you got
the idea that the meeting at which
the Forum’s Constitution was to be
= upon “was mysteriously called
oO i”

What in fact happened is as fol-
lows.

Two nights before the scheduled
meeting of the full Steering Commit-
tee I met with the subcommittee re-
sponsible for drafting a Constitu-
tion. In the interim between these
two meetings there was a death in
the family of one of the committee
members and this person was called
home. Knowing that this person was
largely responsible for writing the
constitution and was also one of its
most ardent supporters, in fairness
to him I postponed the meeting of
the full committee until he had re-
turned to Lexington. The mere post-
ponement of a committee meeting
is hardly newsworthy and thus did
not appear “in the page one news
columns” as you feel it should have.

In the future, if you have any
questions about the Student Leader-
ship Forum I shall be happy to an-
swer them. One of the main purposes
of the Forum is to provide an ef-
fective medium for the exchange of
ideas between students. We are not
the “mysterious” organization you
make us out to be.

Respectfully submitted,
JUDSON P. REIS

the members of the sub-committee
Thanks for clearing up the “mys-
tery.” —Editor.

Hoopsters Lose

As Wallis Stars

By TOM CARPENTER
Tuesday Sports Writer

The Washington and Lee basket-
ball team continues to be a home
court club. The Generals are three
and one at home, but dropped their
third consecutive game in as many
tries on the road Saturday night at
Richmond Professional Institute, 87-
see

Tonight W&L travels to Bridge-
water to play one of the hottest
teams in the state. The Eagles drop-
ped their game with W&L here early
in December by a small margin, but
they are especially tough on their
home court. They have beaten Old
Dominion and Randolph-Macon, two
of the better small college teams
in the state, and lost a close one to
Hampden-Sydney. The Eagles are
not a tall team, but have a good
shooting club. It will take a top ef-
fort by the Generals to beat them on
their court.

Wallis Scores 23

Don Wallis was the Generals’ lead-
ing scorer with 23 points. Coach Bob
McHenry said that Wallis played his
best game of the year. Steve Sweitzer
had 14 points, while big Bob Spes-
sard added 11 before fouling out.
Unfortunately for the Generals their
leading scorer Lou Paterno was as
cold as the weather. Paterno was
able to score only three points, a
total far below his average.

Coach McHenry was disappointed
with the defensive showing of his
club. He commented, “The boys
played like a team that hadn’t played
for three weeks,’ which describes
the situation well in that the Gen-
erals hadn’t played since their vic-
tory over PMC three weeks ago.

 

Riflemen Lose To

Richmond, UV a.

By JIM BARBER
Tuesday Sports Writer

In a tri-meet between W&L, the
University of Richmond, and the
University of Virginia, the Generals
lost to the larger schools in the rifle
match held Saturday. The Universi-
ty of Virginia took first place with
a team high of 1411 points, with the
University of Richmond and Wash-
ington and Lee close behind with
scores of 1384 and 1356 respective-
ly.

General rifle coach Sgt. James
McSheffrey pointed out that UVa.
shot much better than they usual-
ly do, but noted that W&L had
two outstanding scores as Jones, with
a personal total of 278, and Klick
with a score of 266 led the Generals
on the range.

Coach McSheffrey also noted that
Washington and Lee was out of prac-
tice after the Christmas holidays
and did not do as well in the stand-
ing position. The last General match
before exams takes place this Sat-
urday, and pits the Minks against
the strong military powers, VPI and
VML.

Aside from Steward’s redeeming
pin in 1:42 of the first period in
the heavyweight class, the only other
fall of the evening occurred when
Tom Stover injured his shoulder
early in his 147-pound match and
was pinned by Pfeiffer’s Chris Cordi.
Grappler coach Dick Miller indi-
cated that Stover’s injury was not
extremely serious, but will probably
keep him out of action until the
second semester.

First Matches Close

In the first two matches of the
meet, the Generals were defeated by
the clock both times as Butch West
and Dick Musick both lost because
of the one Pfeiffer point gained on
time advantage. West lost to Dave
Crawford, 3-2, while Pfeiffer Col-
lege’s captain, Art Merrion downed
Musick for his first loss of the year,
7-6.

W&L’s Kimbel White came back,
however, to make the score 6-3, by
outpointing his opponent, Steve
Zimmerman, before Stover’s unfor-
tunate match gave the North Caro-
lina college an 11-3 advantage.

Smith and Winfield

Pete Winfield and Herb Smith,
wrestling at 157 and 177 respective-
ly, both decisioned their men. Win-
field shut out Boyd Stokes, 4-0,
while Smith overwhelmed Doug Mc-
Kenzie, 6-1. Before General Captain
Smith outpointed his opponent, how-
ever, Ed Jansen was defeated by
Pfeiffer’s Bob Hand, 4-1.

Wrestle RPI Next

The tie gained at Pfeiffer brings
the W&L wrestling season record to
3-1-1, with one match remaining
before exams with RPI. That match
with Richmond Professional Institute
will take place at W&L, January
18 at 8:00 p.m.

Football Rules Changed

Coach McLaughlin Lauds
New Substituticn Ruling

By JIM CROTHERS
Tuesday Sports Editor

In keeping with the great majority of the nation’s football
coaches, Washington and Lee’s head football mentor, Lee
McLaughlin, today expressed “‘satisfaction” in the changing of
the substitution rules. The General coach pointed out that the
new rule, as he understands it now, will allow more individuals
a chance to play and will reduce to a minimum the headaches
caused by the past complicated rule.

 

 

The new rule, as reported by several of the area’s news-
papers, now allows free substitution whenever the clock is stop-
ped and also permits the entry of two players on any down
even if the clock is running. This is a simplification of the 1963
rule that was so complicated that many of the nation’s colleges
ignored it altogether.

Coach Mac stated that the change will, if anything, help
W&L football hopes for next year. Besides allowing more play-
ers to compete and lessening his paperwork, McLaughlin will
now be able to communicate more directly with his quarterback
and send in directions and/or plays and players immediately
as they are needed instead of waiting, as was the case this year,
until time is out.

One of the main reasons for the NCAA Rule’s Committee’s
stand against unlimited substitution is their argument that they
are endeavoring to create the “all-around” football player.
W&L’s coach implied that in order to do that, (i.e., create an
“all-around” player) maybe every man should be required to
take a turn at playing quarterback to make him more well-
rounded.

The football mentor added that the Rules Committee is
against unlimited substitution also because it wishes to “protect
the smaller schools with limited participation.” But the General
coach pointed out that it was the initially smaller schools them-
selves who were guilty of disregarding the 1963 rule and re-
turning, on their own, to free substitution.

Generals Nip Deacons, 50-45
As Wolfe, Relay Set Records

By SKIP CHASE
Tuesday Sports Writer
A good team effort by the Generals with record times by
John Wolfe and the freestyle relay team of Gary Bokinsky,
Steve Lexter, Bart Taylor, and Bill Wildrick boosted the W&L

swimmers to a 50-45 triumph over the Wake Forest Deacons

 

Saturday evening and upped the*
Washington and Lee seasonal record
to three wins and two losses.

Heralded as a “touch and go” meet
by tank coach Norris Eastman, and
a cruical one concerning a winning
season, the swimmers, led by cap-
tains Walt McManus and Jim Wal-
lenstein (who turned in an excellent
winning performance in the 200-yard
breaststroke with a time of 2:26.1)
won the opening medley relay and
continued to ward off the determined
Deacons.

Deacons Close Gap

Following the medley relay, Wake
Forest rebounded with a Ist and
2nd in the 200-yard freestyle to
close the point gap to 6-3. However,
the North Carolinians saw their
hopes dim as W&L led by Taylor
and George Bokinsky, took first and

second in both the 50 free and 200

Wake Forest gained only one point
in the diving as Greer and Stevens
took second and third, but the Dea-
cons continued to gain as they cap-
tured firsts in the 200-yard butter-
fly, the 200-yard backstroke, and
the 500 freestyle. However, lack of
depth kept Wake Forest from trying

Rockefeller of being a Democrat.
Yet, Goldwater’s reason for not de-

not wish to injure the party by de-

As Drummond continues to point
out, if Goldwater is going to accuse
a member of his own party of not
being fit to be a part of that party,
he ought to make the accusation
face to face. If Republicans are go-
ing to have to choose between these
two men, something should be done
to make it clear what ground the
two of them stand on.

|] stant warnings and ridicule from the

ranks of smoking abstainers.

The attack most commonly used
by the smoking antagonists (who,
whether they realize it or not, have
intruded on our American Consti-
tutional right to smoke in peace) is
that we smokers are shortening our
lives every time we light a cigarette.

I would like to answer this by
saying that possibly this criticism
is justifled. Assuming we smokers
will die sooner than the non-
smokers though, I hope these ab-
stainers have noticed the many who
refuse to quit in the midst of all
odds. In fact, most of the non-
smoker’s friends are probably smok-
ers.

For this reason, it is obvious that
we at Washington and Lee should
not quit smoking; in fact, all those
who have not begun smoking should
definitely begin! What fun would
it be if you had to live in the world
when all your friends had died ten
years before you?

Considering the fact that it is
easier to start smoking than to stop
I urge all non-smokers who value
their friends to start smoking. Let’s
all do our share to make this world
a more happy, enjoyable place in
which to live. A world that plays
together should die together.

belief that his son is a loss, his
daughter is intuitive enough to get
along with him, and his wife is
“tough as a boot, unmoving, unyield-
ing, and safe.” The prescription for
this latter belief—“there comes a
time for decent, honorable retire-
ment, not dramatic, not punishment
of self or family—just goodby, a
warm bath and an opened vein, a
warm sea and a razor blade.” This
struggle occupies Ethan’s thoughts
in the closing pages of the novel.

Style Is Incomparable

To say that critics have been mys-
tified by this recent novel by Stein-
beck is an understatement. In my
opinion, though, the novel is an
engaging one, written in an incom-
parable style. Indeed, style is the
novel’s strongest point. I think this
is where Steinbeck’s genius has
shown most consistently, and it is
certainly the most worthwhile aspect
of The Winter of Our Discontent.
Word usage is quick and fresh; de-
scriptive passages are sharp and
vivid. The story flows smoothly,
reads easily.

Behind the style is Steinbeck’s
message, if there is one. He seems to
tion represents the last of the ideal-
ists, and that they are bound to de-
spair. The new generation, disil-
lusioned from childhood, will not fall
victim to the old ideals, but will
make its way in the world by hook
or by crook.

and others had not thought about it
at all.

Perhaps the wisest statement made
during the survey was, “The idea
sounds good but I simply need to
know more about the _ situation.”
How much work does the EC do
now? Is this work a burden to the
members? How many people would
make up the proposed Student Sen-
ate and would its powers clash with
the proposed Honor Council? These
are just a few of the questions asked
by students.

In conclusion, it appears that
many,—at least half—of the student
body is uneasy about the status quo
in student government. The major-
ity of these have only nebulous ideas
as to what they would actually do
with the student government and
seem to feel that they need to know
more facts about the situation.

CLUB &
| CAMPUS
ue FASHIONS

BY 0. E. SCHOEFFLER, ESQuire’s FASHION DIRECTOR

If you'll excuse us while we misquote the Post Office motto, “Neither
rain nor snow.nor cold of day can keep us from our appointed
rounds!” Right now, we’re going to tell you about the latest in outer-
wear for the campus, so that rain, src.” and cold of day won’t have
any effect on your appointed—ari fashionable—rounds!

      

-~y JHE LONG AND SHORT OF IT tells the jacket
24°°f" story this fall. Latest lengths range from 34” to
-\ 38”—the better to keep those wintry blasts at
i bay! They’re available in a variety of fabricp—

yy i warm wool fleeces, practical polyester-and-cot-

fee | ton combinations, or newly-revived corduroys

aR 4 oA —styled in standard, single-breasted models.

i -§\< "5° The more traditional waist-length jacket, either

“ = 1 with zip-front or button closure, is still a stand-

‘\:1.. by, especially in gabardine weaves. Most of these

* “models have hoods—attached or zip-on-and-off
—for added convenience and protection.

   

YOUR LOVE CAN KEEP YOU WARM — but linings do it better!

And there’s lots of latitude for you to choose from, both in color
and type of lining. Pile fabrics are very big indeed, ranging from the
natural-fiber, natural-color (tan and brown tones) alpaca pile to
acrylic fiber piles in blazing colors—reds, blues and gold shades.
Plaid wool linings are popular, particularly when they’re back-
grounded or accented with brilliant color—any color, as long as it’s
red! Quilted linings get their quota of votes, too, usually in colors to
contrast with the jacket. And many of these linings spill over onto
the collar facing for a bright exterior accent.

SWEATERED SUEDES are making news. Confusing? Not at all—

these are simply suede jackets with knitted sleeves and back, for
smartness, comfort and flexibility. The knit portions of these campus
cover-ups are often bonded to foam backing—extra insurance
against the cold.

BANK ON BULK — Bulky knits will add new

dimensions to your sweater wardrobe. The real
smashers this season are rough and ready rib-
knits and sweaters with a textured tweed look.
Cardigans are candidates for re-election to top
office, both in button-front shawl-collar models,
and in smart, border-striped styles. Look espe-
cially for the new cardigans zipped and border-
striped up the front and leather-patched on the
sleeves. Pullovers with crew or outsize turtle
necks are knitted of soft, Shetland wools—bulk-
ily, of course!

 

TOPFLIGHT TWEEDS TRANSLATE into topcoats, as well as into

the suits and sport jackets that are making their mark this season.
Look for rugged overcheck and herringbone patterns, styled with
slash pockets and raglan sleeves. If you’re in the market for a more
formal topcoat, why not consider an adaptation of the famous
British Warm? It’s double-breasted, with set-in sleeves, and often
comes with leather button closure. They’re usually found in herring-
bone or heather-mixture tweeds with a somewhat smoother finish.

YOU DON’T HAVE TO BE MAD TO BE HATTED — even on cam-

pus! And you'll be headed in the right direction if you choose one of
the new rough-textured felts, or a sport hat made of corduroy or
tweed. Colorful tweed caps are also making a comeback, to.add a
jaunty, country-squire look to your casual outfits.

WILD HORSES CAN BE SHOD—ana so

should you! Leave your dirty sneakers in the

=@ locker, and try on a pair of sturdy brogues for
yO size—and for a change. Well-polished slip-ons
y in a moccasin design make a nice alternative, as

Ee do brushed or grained leather hi-risers and
boots. And when it’s time for sloshing around in the slush, remember
that the flapping, wide-open overshoe that was a trademark of the
Twenties is now a thing of the past! The current crop are handsome,
sturdy boots, zip-fronted for easy access—a real must for protecting
your leather footgear.

   

So much for this appointed round. Next month, a Command Per-
formance—a run-down on the formal dress that almost reaches
uniform status during the holidays. We'll be there in plenty of time
for you to get it organized. See you then,

Rubin’s Band Highlights
1963-64 Fancy Dress Bal

By WARREN MONTGOMERY
The Fancy Dress Ball tonight will be highlighted by Stan Rubin and his thirteen-piece or- |

chestra. The Ball will begin at 9 p.m. at Evans Dining Hall.
Rubin’s nationally known Dance Orchestra has made previous appearances at Washington

and Lee. A contingent of his
FD Ball.

With the “Mardi Gras” theme as
its setting, the dance will also fea-
ture the traditional Figure, follow-
ed at 10:30 by a special concert of
popular gospel singing.

The Cocktail Party

The Faney Dress Weekend was
launched this afternoon by the IFC
Cocktail Party, which featured the
Essex. The party was given at the
Moose Lodge at 4 o’clock. The three-
member Essex group gave a two
and a half hour performance. They
became famous as recording stars
with their two hits “Walking Mir-
acle” and “Easier Said Than Done.”

Following the Cocktail Party is a
banquet for the members of the
Figure and of the Faculty Social
Functions Committee at the Robert
E. Lee Hotel. The banquet is given

in honor of FD president, Randy:

Wootton.

Dance Board president Ed Croft
reminds students that appropriate
costumes are required at the Ball
tonight. Students in tuxedos will not
be admitted.

New Orleans Decorations

The main event of the weekend, the
Fancy Dress Ball itself, will begin
at 9:00 tonight in Evans Hall. The
theme of the Ball is, of course,
Mardi Gras, and this theme will be
borne out as fully as possible. Evans
Dining Hall will be virtually turned
into a New Orleans street scene for
the occasion. Eight-foot carnival
masks will line the walls, and a 28-
foot-wide backdrop will be behind
the bandstand. The backdrop, a mur-
al embellished with lanterns, will
give the effect of actually being on a
festive New Orleans street during

k i

 

Mardi Gras. Additional local color
will be furnished by a colonnade
through the hall, picket fences, and
a grass plot with a fountain in the
center.

The costumes worn by those at-
tending will present an unlimited
array of types. In fact, the purpose
of the Mardi Gras theme is to spice
up the Ball with variety, to en-
courage originality, and to make it
easy for everyone to come up with
a costume. The only limiting require-
ment is that real costumes be worn.
Street clothes, tuxedos and distaste-
ful or shoddy apparel will not be
considered costumes. Dates must
wear costumes or formal gowns, and
white tie and tails is acceptable for
men.

Evans Hall will be opened at 8:00
p.m., and the Figure will begin
the festivities at 9. The Figure, a
formal presentation of the dance set
officialdom, will include President
of the Dance Board Ed Croft, Vice-
president Steve Hibbard, Fancy
Dress President Randy Wootton,
Wootton’s six vice-presidents, and
the presidents of the eighteen frater-
nities.

Jazz and Gospel

Stan Rubin and his orchestra will
open the dance itself with a suite
to W&L, composed by Mr. Rubin and
based on the melody of the Washing-
ton and Lee Alma Mater.

At 10:30, two gospel groups will
give a brief concert. The first group
will be the Sweet Chariot Singers,
the nucleus of the Sweet Chariot
Club in New York. They will be
followed by the Grandison Singers,
one of the original pop gospel groups.
After the concert, Stan Rubin and

orchestra will continue

Dakota Staton at Concert

Tomorrow, the main event will be
the traditional concert in Doremus
gymnasium. This year, the concert
is in the afternoon, from 2:30 to
4:30 It will feature Dakota Staton
and her trio. Miss Staton is des-
cribed as jazz singer, emphasizing
blues.

The official part of the FD Dance
set will end with the concert, but
of course the weekend will be kept
going with fraternity combos, booze,
and brunches until the girls go back
to their respective schools and we
start a new semester.

‘Hell Week?
Almost Erased

In recent years fraternities across
the nation have been subject to
severe criticism concerning the se-
lective practices and hazing tradi-
tions of such groups. At Washing-
ton and Lee, the practice of being
selective remains; however, pledg-
ing might be losing some of its
active support. Art Broadus, presi-
dent of the Interfraternity Council,
stated that there could not be any
concentrated pledging activities. This
includes “hell week,” but whether
it is meant to include “hell night” is
somewhat unclear.

Eight fraternities have been ques-
tioned as to whether they retain
“hell night” by the Ring-tum Phi in
an effort to determine what the con-
census on this matter was.

Four of the fraternities stated
that they had no hell night at all,
while four fraternities replied that
they still retained hell night even
though one fraternity president
thought that his fraternity was
against the practice.

Those who supported the event
gave such reasons as it was fun or
that it helped bring unity in the
freshman class and gave the pledges
a feeling that they had really done
something to become a_ fraternity
brother. Opponents of hell night
said that it was useless, detrimental
to the pledges, a waste of time, and
that members of the fraternity did
not have time to show up for the
event.

Shenandoah Publication

Professor James Boatwright, fac-
ulty editor to the Shenandoah, has
announced that the new issue of the
Shenandoah, is due to come out some
time at the end of this month.

Appearing in the issue will be
works by George Garrett, Carolyn
Kizer and Oswald Le Winter as well
as poems by James Dickey, an essay |
by Wallace Stevens, and numerous |
reviews. Also there
translations from Apollinaire.

Student’s Article
On Houston
Is Recognized

An article by W&L sophomore
Maurice Fliess has been reprinted
in the Congressional Record by Sen-
ator A. Willis Robertson of Vir-
ginia.

Fliess may be the youngest person
in history to have had a news story
published in the Record. His article
concerns the Gen. Sam Houston
Commemorative Stamp, issued in
December in honor of the Rock-
bridge County native.

Fliess’ story first appeared in the
16 edition of the Roanoke
Times, and was subsequently re-
printed in the Lexington News-Ga-
zette on Dec. 18. On Dec. 20 Senator
Robertson asked the Senate to have
the article on Houston printed in
the Record.

The story as printed consumes
more than a column and a half in
the appendix of the Record. Sen.
Robertson later wrote to Fliess,
“You have written a fine thumb-
nail sketch of a great Virginian for
whom I always have had the great-
est admiration.”

 

Normally, newspaper reprints in
the Record are exclusively editorials
taken from metropolitan publications
and written by veteran journalists.

A Potent Display

To alumni, friends, mavericks, freeloaders, and, above all,
to those of you of the fairer sex, we extend a most cordial wel-

come to the 1964 Washington

and Lee Fancy Dress. We trust

that these three days of bacchanalian madness will provide for
you a pleasant refuge from the problems and tensions of a

tempestuous world outside.

We salute this occasion more than for its escapism, how-
ever; it offers a much-needed reassurance in the face of tomor-

row’s anxieties. For the events

that await you are a display of

energy and power that can transform a world; we are witnessing
amidst our revelry and high spirits a new generation on re-
view, with a show of animation that few nations of the world

can boast of.

To all who are pessimistic,

then, we present living proof

that all our fears are unfounded: concentrated in Shenandoah
Valley this weekend is the latent power that is more than
sufficient to win the Cold War, launch rockets to the moon, and
set our wobbling world back on its axis. Thus comforted, we
join our fellow celebrants in a toast of victory—Challengers of
the future, look on this weekend and beware!

 

Despite Claim of “Polls,”
E. C. Respected by Majority

By DREW BAUR

In spite of claims by certain ques-
tionable polls, there seems to be a
notable change in
the attitude of the
student body to-
ward the Execu-
tive Committee
this semester. Last
year there was an
outspoken fear of
Executive Com-
mittee powers and
at year’s end there
was a fairly size-
able minority of
students who were
in favor of Lamar Lamb’s revisions.
This year, despite the efforts of
certain individuals to change the
EC or discredit it, there can be no
doubt that the Executive Commit-
tee has the support of the vast ma-
jority of the student body.

It is difficult to say what is the
reason for this. Perhaps it is the
fact that the three officers are un-
dergraduates. Among many under-
graduates, especially freshmen and
sophomores, there is a feeling that
the law student body is rather re-
moved from the rest of the school.
Undoubtedly trial by peers is some-
what comforting to many students.
Perhaps the reason is just a general
apathy on the part of the student
body. Perhaps it has been the fact
that fewer people have been asked
to leave this year.

Whatever the reason, this year the

 

Baur

| EC is no longer a feared, but a re-
i spected institution. This is what it
was intended to be, a group working
in the best interests of the student
body. It has finally succeeded in
gaining the confidence of the student
body as a court, not a police force.
Hopefully this trend will continue
further than June, 1964.

Miscellaneous

While the changed EC attitude is
the major positive change this se-
mester, other plaudits should be
given out. The new cut system, the
tremendous job done on Openings
at both concert and cocktail party,
the new assumption of responsibility
by the IFC, the continued excel-
lence of the debate team in inter-
collegiate debate, the Homecoming
football win all contributed to a sig-
nificant rise in school spirit:

BEST BETS FOR THE WEEK-
END: Nelson Rockefeller and Liz
Taylor, Va. Tech to win by 10, big
team at the Stevesville Motel, the
end of exam flick teams, and artil-
lery punch over Sem.

 

Notice

Fraternity freshmen are requested
to eat the evening meal of January
31 in their respective houses and
not the Evans Dining Hall because
of Fancy Dress preparations.

Also, if anybody wants to rent a
Fancy Dress costume, please contact
Steve Hibbard. No tuxedos or inap-
propriate dress will be allowed.

 

 

 

Miss Dakota Staton

“Ball Masque” of 1907
Origin of Fancy Dress

Fancy Dress has come a long way
since it was introduced at Washing-
ton and Lee 57 years ago. In fact,
the 1907 crowd of 20 couples has
been increased to well over a
thousand in the last few years, and
the cost of the dance has spiraled
from $44 to $8,000.

Simple Beginnings

In 1907, Annie Jo White, Presi-
dent of the Dramatic Club, pre-
sented a “Ball Masque” as a re-
ward for the successful actors of
the group. More than half of those
attending were first-classmen at
VMI, and a meager crowd of 40
danced in the old gymnasium, on
the site of the present chemistry
building. The $44 cost was paid
from the Dramatic Club’s profits.

Today, W&L launches an $8,000
extravaganza including a ball, con-
cert, cocktail party, and featuring
Stan Rubin and Orchestra, the Sweet
Chariot Singers, the Grandison Sing-
ers, and Dakota Staton and her Trio.
Fancy Dress has had an interesting
history—a history which has includ-
ed almost every theme imaginable
and most of the nation’s big name
bands.

There have been constant changes
in the organization and method of
presentation of Fancy Dress.

For instance, it was not until 1929
that a student president of the danc-
ing set directed the affair. In that
year, the California Ramblers enter-
tained the partying gentlemen. The
Ramblers came from exotic, far-off

 

Farmville, Va.

But after 1929, the orchestras of
some of the more popular groups
journeyed to Lexington for the oc-
casion. In 1936 Professor Kay Key-
ser of the College of Musical
Knowledge arrived. He was fol-
lowed by Eddie Duchin, Hal Kemp,
Benny Goodman, and Woody Her-
man. Recently we have danced to
the Dorsey Brothers and Les El-
gart.

Publicity-wise, Fancy Dress has
achieved national notice on several
occasions and finally has been titled
what the vice-president for publicity
perennially calls “The South’s Out-
standing College Event.” In 1932,

Walter Winchell came to Fancy,

Dress from Broadway and _ intro-
duced the dance set to the country
in a special radio broadcast. And
almost every year, until several
years ago, Roanoke radio and tele-
vision stations rebroadcast tapes and
films of the ball.

Best Known in South

Fancy Dress has indeed had a
long and colorful history, but there
are still anomalies about its orgins.
Some say that Annie Jo White was
a librarian here in 1907 and that the
Ball started, not in the old gymna-
sium, but in a room above what
is now McCrums, at a party Miss
White gave for her friends. But re-
gardless of how it started, Fancy
Dress has changed in every manner
to become the most liked and talked-
about social event among the col-
leges of the South.

 

Ideologies Lose Significance

With New Era Of Cold Peace

By CHARLIE FLIPPEN |
The Cold War has slowly

become a cold peace and ide-
ologies are gradually ending, a
history professor said here in a

recent lecture.

John Lukacs, a professor at Chest- |
nut Hill College and author of the
book, A History of the Cold War dis-
cussed these ideas on Thursday,
January 16, before the Propaganda
and Psychological Warfare class in
a talk entitled “From Cold War to
Cold Peace: The End of Ideology?”

During the first part of the talk,
Lukaes developed his thesis that the
Cold War has gradually turned into
a cold peace. This has been happen-
ing since 1956, he said.

He listed four major causes for this
change.

1. In 1956 when the United States
did not help the Hungarian revolu-
tionists, Khrushchev became con-
vinced that we would not risk a
war to help free Eastern Europe.

2. Khrushchev has come to realize,
as he has said, that war is no longer
possible as a way of revolution. Thus,
peaceful coexistence has come into
being.

3. The Sino-Soviet quarrel. “I am
convinced that this quarrel will con-
tinue,’ Lukacs said. Russia cannot
afford a divided front. Thus, she
must turn more to Europe and to
better relations with the West.

 

4. Europe has now recovered from |

the war. Therefore, she will no long-
er be as dependent on the United
States as she has been in recent
history, he said. As the European
countries find themselves freer of the
United States, America will be
forced into better relations with the
Soviet Union.

The resulting peace will not be
friendly, however, he said. “It will
be a cold, unfriendly peace.”

This cold peace does not “mean
that the two ideologies will merge,”
Lukaes said.

Rather, as he sees it, the two
ideologies are slowly coming to an
end anyway.

In developing this second major
theme of his talk, the historian
pointed out that ideologies actually
began in the late 18th century.

Religion was then decreasing in
importance, men turned to poli-
tics to solve their problems, he said.

The 1920’s and 30’s were the high
mark of ideological theories. Young
men flocked to the isms as the wave
of the future. Today almost nobody
in Europe and America expects the
ideologies to solve the world’s prob-
lems, he said.

“This does not mean that ideas are
not important any longer,” Lukacs
said. They move slower and are
sometimes not so evident, but they
are vital.

“Ideas are history,” he said.

Lukacs appeared here under the
auspices of the Department of Jour-
nalism and Communications.

 

On October 14 this reporter at-}
tended a meeting of that organization |
which pleases to style itself as
Washington and Lee’s student gov-|
vernment. This body, the EC, this}
Cabal against the life of the Uni-|
versity, met last night shrouded in|
mysterious deep-dark secrecy as
usual, but ‘this time they had a re-|
porter to contend with who was
more persevering than your ordi-|
nary run-of-the-mill reporter.

Three times I was thrown out of |

the meeting by the black-robed and

hooded conspirators, but the fourth ,

time I came in wielding the jaw-,

bone of an ass and gained permanent
entry.

Impending Doom of Editors

The first order of business was not
the reading of minutes, since this
top-secret committee dares not keep
any records. The first business was,
rather, the discussion of a secret list
of conscriptions, made up of edi-
tors of the Ring-tum Phi who have
crossed the will of the all-powerful
clique.

The discussion concerned not how
to depose the guilty editors, but in-
stead, how to punish them. The

punishment decreed was that the

 

 

guilty be run through their presses

and printed with their own editor-
ials.
The next item on the EC’s agenda

was a report of some uneasy feeling ||

among the student body regarding
the condition of student government.
The crafty president of the EC dis-
missed these rumors as “absurd
falsehoods” and ended the discus-
sion abruptly by inviting the com-
mittee to his apartment for drinks.
This move was completely obvious
to myself as a mere strategem to
elude the people’s press correspon-
dent. I followed hard on the heels
of the furtive EC members, who

States Survey

(Since W&L is going coed this
weekend, we of the Ring-tum Phi
staff are entering into the spirit of
things with the following survey
on the differences between the
male and his better half. All we
can say is, Vive la difference! Ed.)

The difference between men and
women is even greater than you
may think.

By examining any one of the
body’s approximately 30 trillion cells,
a scientists can tell if it belongs to
a man or a woman.

A man’s brain is slightly heavier
than a woman’s, and the average
red-blooded American male has 10
per cent more red blood cells than
his feminine counterpart. A woman’s
heart beats eight to ten more times
per minute than that of her current
heart-throb; if both live average
life spans, she’s ticked off some
300,000,000 more heartbeats than he
will!

Females Knock-Kneed

“Straight from the shoulder” is
a male attitude. A man’s arms do
hang that way; in women, there’s a
definite bend at the elbow so that
the lower arm extends outward at an
angle. Similarly, a man’s thighs and
legs are in a straight line while a
woman by comparison, seems
knock-kneed her legs bend inward
at the knee.

Relative to a man, a woman has
a longer head, but a shorter neck;
shorter limbs, but a longer trunk;
a seated woman is relatively taller
than a seated man. Her thumb is
shorter, her index finger longer, and
her wrist swivels with more ease—
explaining why women excel at del-
icate manual work.

Though a man’s vocal cords are
longer and thicker than a woman’s,
she apparently gets in not only the

On The Sexes

last word, but the first one, too. Girl
babies tend to speak a little earlier
than boys, and to utter words more
comprehensible to their doting par-
ents. Studying children in the same
social brackets, psychologists found
that little girls use longer sentences
than little boys! Speech therapists
say that stuttering is two to ten times
as common in males as in females.

Here’s an interesting fact to re-
member next time you get involved
in an argument with your sweet-
heart: each sex tends to hear its
own voice better! A woman’s hear-
ing is keener than a man’s in the
higher frequency ranges, while men’s
ears pick up low notes more readily.

Color blindness affects one man in
every 25, but only one woman in
250. Even as tiny babies, females are
apparently more color-conscious; in
tests made on infants aged five and
a half months to 24 months, more
girls than boys grabbed for the
brightly colored discs in preference
to the gray ones.

So far, there’s no conclusive evi-
dence as to which sex has the keener
sense of smell. Both sexes enjoy
fragrance of the right type: accord-
to researchers for the Shulton Com-
pany, makers of men’s and women’s
toiletries, men use a surprising $44
million worth of scented after-shave
lotion each year. Shulton also esti-
mates that more than half the per-
fume worn by women is bought for
them by men as gifts.

The Grandison Singers To Appear At Ball
Page 3

 

By TOM WHITE

The wrap-up of the intramural
wrestling season highlighted an
otherwise light sports schedule the
last week before exams. Kappa Sig
downed Sigma Nu in this week’s
first match, Sigma Nu closing the
season at 0-4, and Kappa Sig at
1-2-1. In the week’s other match,
twice beaten SAE picked up win
number two the easy way... a for-
feiture over PEP, who closed the
season 0-3-1.

With the only wrestling matches
still remaining to be played, post-
ponements, only one team has
clinched a berth in the playoffs...
unbeaten KA who took their division
title with a 4-0 record.

After nine weeks the best: 1. Phi
Gam, 3-0; 2. KA, 4-0; 3. Delt, 2-1.

Handball

Beta moved to within just one
game of wrapping up their divisional
handball league championship, with
a 5-0 victory over DU. Beta, who
still remains undefeated needs only
to down Sigma Chi following exams
to make the playoffs. Sigma Nu re-
mained in contention for their di-
vision’s championship by winding up
the season with a 5-0 win over win-
less Lambda Chi. Sigma Nu finished
the season with a 3-1 record, while
Lambda Chi has an 0-2 record with
two games yet to go. Best chance to
take over first from Sigma Nu:
PiKA, thus far unbeaten in two
starts. In the week’s final match,
Law closed up the season the same
way they started it...with a for-
feiture. Winning the match was SPE
who thus closed up the season with
a 3-1 record, and a chance for the
playoffs—if un-beaten KA stumbles
in its last match against SAE. The
best: 1. Beta, 3-0; Delt, 3-0; 5. KA,
3-0.

Bowling

Beta closed up their bowling sea-
son unbeaten, by virtue of their
victory over previously once beaten
Phi Gam. Beta makes it into the
playoffs with a 4-0 record and
champs in their division. Phi Gam
now sports a 1-2 record. Previous-
ly unbeaten Pi Phi was handed their
first loss of the season by still un-
beaten Phi Psi. Phi Psi moves into
first place in their division with
a 3-0 record, while Pi Phi closed
out the season at 3-1.

In the final week’s match, ZBT
stayed unbeaten with a 3-1 victory
over PiKA. ZBT moved into a two-
way tie for first with Phi Kap after
the victory, with both showing 2-0
records. PiKA’s record now stands
at 1-2.

After the week’s matches, these
look like the best: 1. Phi Kap, 3-0; 2.
SAE, 3-0; 3. Kappa Sig, 3-0.

Exams played the dominant role
in basketball, with no games sched-
uled. So no change from last week’s
ratings. The best: 1. SAE, 3-0, 2.
Sigma Nu, 3-0; 3. PiKA, 3-0.

With a heavy spring intramural
schedule coming up, the Friday
sports staff will endeavor to continue
to bring its readers the top intra-
mural news.

Home Sweet Home for Basketball Team;
But Too Bad, Generals Forced to Travel

Can a Washington and Lee basket-
ball team win on the road?

The Generals lay their three-
season 2-18 “there” record on the
line next Thursday at Bristol, Ten-
nessee, where they will play King
College.

Thus far this year, W&L is zero for
four on the road, but fans can find
solace in that this record is better
than that of 1961-62, when they were
0-8.

King College won last year in
Lexington by a 62-58 score in over-
time. But then last year W&L op-
ponents even won here (the Gen-
erals were 2-6 both at home and on
the road in regular season games
last year).

Coach Bob McHenry said of the
home court phenomenon, “In basket-
ball more than any other sport, the
home team has a great advantage.
All baskets are a little bit different.”

Statistics Revealing

In four home games this year, at
press time, W&L has hit 42.4 per
cent of their field goal attempts, the
lowest percentage being 39.7 against
Bridgewater. Away, the Generals
have only a 38.2 percentage, the
worst being 35.7 against R.P.I.

Three and one at home, the team
has outscored its opponents by seven
points a game. On the road, 0-4, they
have been beaten by more than
thirteen points a game.

McHenry noted that the W&L
team is always young. Of five
starters this year, three are soph-
omores, only one a senior. He said,
“A young team always suffers on
the road. We’ve never done well on
the road.”

On the fact that the opposition
has scored more than 87 points a
game in away games, McHenry said
that the team wasn’t able to play a
pressing man-to-man, and that it
would switch to a zone defense.

Bad Years

In 1961-62, when the Generals were
6-11 overall, they lost all eight road
games, and won six of nine home
games. Last year, 5-14 overall, they
were 2-6 both at home and away in
regular season games.

Add those figures to this year,
and Washington and Lee has a
slightly better than .500 (11-10)
record at home. This can be attri-
buted to the enthusiastic and loyal
support given them by student fans.

McHenry noted that King College
is a taller team, but said he would
not be able to scout them. Thus far
this year playing against taller
squads, the Generals nonetheless

have the rebound edge.

He said that this season’s record
on the road was due to a team let-
down. He said, “The whole team is
worse on the road.”

Last year, W&L defeated Bridge-
water and Pennsylvania Military
College away from home. They also
won against Southwestern in the
College Athletic Conference tourna-
ment, but then the site was neutral.

 

W&L To Enter In VMI Relays;
Lord Predicts Good Showing

Fancy Dress weekend holds some-
thing extra for 14 members of the
Washington and Lee winter track
team.

The annual VMI Winter Relay
meet gets underway at 4:30 Saturday
(February 1) at the VMI fieldhouse
with the Generals represented in all
but two events. Only the shot put
and the two mile relay will be with-
out General participants.

The W&L squad has entered four
relay events, with Chris Kell, Rob-
ert Bingham, Bill Jarrett and Gordon
Gay opening the evening at 6:45
in the sprint shuttle event. This re-
lay is composed of four 60-yard
dashes, run alternately.

Co-captain Skip Essex joins Kell,
Bingham and Jarrett in the 880 re-
lay. Essex is also entered in the four
mile relay along with Andy Kilpat-
rick, Riff O’Connor and Charles
Head.

The final General relay event is
the sprint medley, composed of a
440, two 220’s and an 880. W&L has
entered the team of Jarrett, Kell,
Bingham and Essex.

Leading the individual entrants is
another co-captain, Robin Kell. He
is entered in the triple jump, the

first event on the agenda at 4:30,
and the high jump.

Walter Nicklin is the Generals’
representative in the 70-yard high
hurdles, and Chris Kell is entered in
the 60-yard dash.

Other W&L entrants include David
Myers in the broad jump, John Gra-
ham in the pole vault and Brad
Shinkle and John Laimbeer in the
two-mile run.

Track coach Norm Lord is optimis-
tic about the Generals’ chances in
the meet. “The teams are placed in
their relay sections by the size of
the schools. Therefore, we will not
be running in the same heats as
Maryland, Navy, Dike and some of
the other big schools.

“There will be top class competi-
tion there, but I think we will make
a good showing,” he stated.

‘Jocks’ Meet

Stiff Weekend Challenge

By BILLY CANNON

f Washington and Lee’s sport-

|ing teams, the Friday staff of the Ring-tum Phi feels it both
necessary and proper to report on one of the University’s
oldest and certainly greatest teams—the party team.

In accordance with the University’s changing policies, this

 

once nationally renowned team has*

the past few semesters. Academics no
longer make it possible for these
gallant “minks” to schedule events
from Wednesday afternoon to Mon-
day morning. Instead their activities
have been confined to Thursday
through Sunday.

The Party Team, along with its
shortened schedule, has been forced
to restrict its opponents from the
the outstanding teams on the East-
ern seaboard—UNC, Pennsylvania
and Miami University—to less chal-
lenging teams as the University of
Virginia. Fancy Dress has for many
years been the team’s biggest week-
end—you might call it W&L’s win-
ter tournament. This tournament
promises to be no exception.

According to team captain, Steve
“Bear” Walsh, “We'll be shooting
for the ‘moon’.” As the men tighten
their straps, loosen their belts, and
make the annual post-exam jour-
ney to the “Mount,” the exam
cram will cease and the partying
begin. The quiet streets of Lex-
ington will again rise to the oc-
casion as the wettest town per
capita in the country

Some say this great W&lL. tradition
is fading, but the “Bear” contends
that with men like Mike Sheffey,
Hobbie Morrison and Dick Krietler
our team seems to have a solid
backbone. Veteran Brett Thackston,
although he has slowed down some,
can also be counted on to give
a strong performance.

Aside from the stars of old days
the Generals look to be in pretty
good shape with such sophomore
talent as Bobby Culpepper and Tom
Day. The freshman class is not up
to the team’s standards but look to
men like Barney Starr to carry his

I still have hope that they will not

I have high hopes that I will be
able to further expose the EC’s plot
against the student body next week.
If you do not hear from my pen
again, it will mean that I have been
silenced by the student government
authorities—a student martyr to the
search for trustworthiness, loyalty,
helpfulness, friendliness, courteous-
ness, kindness, obedience, cheerful-
ness, thriftiness, bravery, cleanli-
ness, and reverence in student gov-
ernment.

This liquidation would be nothing
unusual, since our poll of exactly
one hundred students reveals that
this has indeed been the fate of
over 66 per cent of them; but it
would be a tragedy for the free
press and its duty of comforting
you the afflicted.

However, one of the oldest and most
respected groups will not make an

their bodies with different scents,
and even went so far as to perfume
pet animals.

One thing hasn’t changed much:
early Greek men clung to their
beards as symbols of masculinity and
pitied clean-shaven tribes, imagin-
ing they had been struck by some
disease that turned them into wo-
men. Today’s men bewail shaving as
a nuisance, but Al Anderson, a sales
consultant for Shulton, doesn’t think
they’d give it up if they could. Says
Mr. Anderson:

“In a survey cited by Vance Pack-
ard a few years back, a group of
men were asked this question: sup-
pcse science developed an inexpen-
sive “miracle” cream that in only
three applications would rid you
of your bothersome beard forever.
Would you buy it?

Less than 3 per cent of them
showed the slightest interest; one
man who did said ‘It would be okay
because I have hair on my chest.’”

Psychological Differences
Differences in male-female psy-
chology showed up interestingly on a
multiple-choice word-association test
administered to a test group by psy-

lutes those students who will not be

chologists Lewis M. Terman and
Catherine Cox Miles. It was found
that the word “closet” reminded
most male subjects of “door,” most
women of “clothes.” “Charm” tended
to make women think of “beauty”
and men of “snake!” When the word
“home” was mentioned, women
thought sentimentally of “happy,”
men prosaically of “house.”

Which sex is really smarter? In
general intelligence, men and wo-
men seem about equal, according to
those who have studied results of
modern IQ tests. However, more
men than women seem to be found
at either intellectual extreme. More
males fall into the “feeble-minded”
category. But in a survey of ex-
ceptionally gifted children (1Q’s of
132 and over) psychologist Terman
found about 120 boys for every 100
girls that met the minimum re-
quirement.

Women, according to Dr. Justus J.
Schifferes in the Family Medical En-
cyclopedia, are more easily hypno-
tized than men. They are somewhat
more apt to suffer from migraine
headaches. A typical migraine victim,
according to Dr. Schifferes, is a little
woman with fine hair, a smooth
complexion—and perfectionist ten-
dencies! Women are sick about 20
per cent more often than men, yet
at any age, the female death rate
is at least 25 per cent lower than
the male’s!

Is it ever a man’s world? Yes—few
people realize that 105 boys are born
for every 100 girls.

SALUTE: JESSE YOWELL, JR.

During 1962, The Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Com-
pany of Virginia assigned Jesse Yowell, Jr. (B.S.E.E.,
1959) to the Operating Engineers Training Program at
Bell Labs. On finishing his study there, he’ll return to his
company and the increased opportunities that await him.

Jesse earned this honor by showing what he could do
while a Staff Assistant in the General Engineering Depart-
ment. In that job, he made decisions that involved thou-

sands of dollars. He also established a solid reputation
among company engineers for troubleshooting circuit-
damaging transmission problems such as corrosion.

Jesse Yowell, Jr., like many young engineers, is im-
patient to make things happen for his company and him-
self. There are few places where such restlessness is more
welcomed or rewarded than in the fast-growing telephone

business.

Pace Elected
Party Leader

Tom Pace was elected chairman of |. 7

the Progressive Party last night, suc-
ceeding retiring chairman
Woodward. Woodward’s retirement
from the party of which he had
been chairman since its birth last
spring, had been expected for some

time. He had guided the Progressives |.
through their first election with un-| J

canny success, winning well over
two-thirds of the races for class and
student body offices.

After the clique meeting and
Pace’s election, Woodward stated: “I
resigned for non-political, personal
reasons.”

Pace, the new chairman, is also a
successful politician on campus. He
is a senior class officer and has
steered his fraternity, Kappa Sig, in-
to more class offices than any other
house on campus.

Pace had no comment on his elec-
tion other than to say that he is
“pleased to be elected.” The Pro-
gressive Party, he indicated, will
continue under the same organiza-
tion, makeup, and philosophy as it
has since its formation last spring.

A Kappa Sig senior, Pace is the
holder of a Hugh B. Sproul Scholar-
ship. He is a member of the Assimi-
lation Committee and is Film Editor
of the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi. Pace
is from Casper, Wyoming.

Members of the Progressive Party
are the following fraternities: Kap-
pa Sigma, Pi Kappa Alpha, Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, Sigma Nu, Sigma Phi
Epsilon, Zeta Beta Tau, Delta Tau
Delta, Phi Gamma Delia, and Phi
Kappa Psi.

 

Fail-outs Number 22;
Shows Decline In Rate

By HUBIE YOUNG

Dean W. W. Pusey announced to-
day that twenty-two students had
been removed from the University
after the first semester according to
the Automatic Rule. Dean Pusey,
however, stated that this number is
less than in the past two years, and
he stated a strong desire that such
a trend continue.

According to an official University
report, eleven freshmen, ten sopho-
mores, and one upperclassman were
forced to sever their connections
with Washington and Lee. In addi-
tion, Dean Pusey stated that an un-
published number of students had

Fitzgerald Flournoy Dies;
English Teacher Was 65

By LARRY MEEKS

Dr. Fitzgerald Flournoy, 65, died
Wednesday, January 29 in Univer-
sity Hospital, Charlottesville. Dr.
Flournoy had been on the University
faculty for some thirty-eight years
including some two decades as co-
chairman of the English Department.

Dr. Flournoy, who joined the Uni-
versity faculty in 1926, was perhaps

Dr. Fitzgerald Flournoy

known for his teaching and
reading of Shakespeare. Among
other courses he taught the two se-
mesters of Shakespeare, one being
histories and comedies and the other
being tragedies.

His familiarity with Shakespeare’s
works and his readings from Shake-
speare’s plays brought him into other
campus activities. Twice when
Fancy Dress Ball featured a Shake-

best

mond, Virginia, January 18,

 

 

spearian theme, Dr. Flournoy por-
trayed Shakespeare, reading lines
from the Bard’s plays to introduce
the members of the figure.

On one of these occasions, when
Life magazine was covering the Ball
it ran a picture of Dr. Flournoy
during one of his readings.

On another occasion, he read se-
lections from King Lear over Radio
W&L.

Dr. Flournoy was born in Rich-
1899,
the son of Mrs. Boyd Flournoy of
Lexington and the late William
Cabell Flournoy.

He received his B.A. degree from
W&L in 1921 and an M.A. a year
later. As an undergraduate here, he

'| was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, ODK,

Delta Sigma Rho, and was a member
of Phi Kappa Psi.

Dr. Flournoy was the second
Washington and Lee alumnus to win
a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford.
There he was awarded a B.A. degree
with honors in 1924 and in 1928, he
was awarded a Master’s degree.

He received his Ph.D. degree from
Yale in 1936.

He taught at Stanford University
during the 1925-26 academic year
and then returned to W&L and was
made full professor of English in
1937.

Dr. Flournoy was a past president
of Gamma Chapter of Virginia, Phi
Beta Kappa, a former member of
the Virginia Committee of Selection,
Rhodes Scholarships, and a member
of the Modern Language Association.

He had articles published in the
Review of English Studies and the
Virginia Magazine on History and
Biography. He was also a frequent
contributor of poetry to magazines
and journals.

Asia, part of his work was in diplo-
macy.

A native of North Carolina, Dr.
Behrman attended Davidson College
and UCLA. He received his Ph.D.
from Princeton University.

A specialist in international in-
vestment, international patent ar-
rangements and international licens-
in agreements, Dr. Behrman is cur-
rently the number three man in the
Department of Commerce behind
Secretary Hodges and the deputy
secretary.

Among his previous positions, the
economist was a professor of eco-
nomics at the University of Delaware
and an associate professor of eco-
nomics at W&L from 1952 to 1957.
| He is the co-author of Survey of
| United States International Finan-
| ces—1950 and Survey of United
States International Finances—1951
and the textbook International Eco-
nomics.

Dr. Talbot studied at Aligarh Mus-
lim University in India and the
School of Oriental and African
Studies at the University of London.

He has ten years of residence and
travel in Asia as a student, naval
officer, foreign correspondent and
writer.

The speakers will appear here un-
der the sponsorship of the School of
Commerce. Their lectures will be
open to students, faculty and towns-
people.

“The purpose of International Re-
lations Week is to bring to the cam-
pus distinguished scholars and men
in public life whose field is foreign
affairs,’ Dr. Milton Colvin, associate
professor of political science, said.

 

 

This program was begun by for-
mer W&L professor Harvey Wheeler.

Hollins Talk |
Is Attack On
W&L Weekend

Are we getting the most out of
our weekend social life, or is there
a need for change?

A W&L student posed this ques-
tion before the Hollins student body
in a talk given last Wednesday night
at the Hollins Chapel. In his ten-
minute speech, senior Ken Lane dis-
cussed problems of communication
created by the stereotype atmosphere
of the weekend combo parties.

Lane compared the relationship of
W&L and Hollins to the movie David
and Lisa, the story of a boy and a
girl who “could not communicate
with each other or to others except
on a very superficial level.” Lane
stated that W&L and Hollins suf-
fered a similar lack of communica-
tion.

One major problem, Lane ex-
plained, was that “combo parties are
so institutionalized that they have

The Mock Convention, now in its
ninth month of planning, is moving
faster and faster toward a success-
ful realization, according to reports
from members of the convention's
Steering Committee.

Announcements from the Mock
Convention this week include a
new brochure, a beauty queen, and
the possibility of an elephant for
the pre-convention parade,

Walter Judd, national keynoter for
the Republican Party in 1960, will
deliver the 1964 address in Lexing-
ton. According to convention publi-
city director Steve Smith, the for-
mer Congressman from Minnesota is
“now being pushed strongly as a
favorite son and also as Republican
Senatorial nominee from Minnesota.”
As Mr. Judd’s prestige rises in the
light of national affairs, so will the
importance of the convention here.

In keeping with Judd’s selection
as the keynoter will be the issu-
anee of a new convention brochure
which will have his picture on the
cover. The brochure will contain
much the same material as found
in the old brochure but will have

a few sections revised to “bring it
up-to-date.” The new pamphlet
will be off the press February 12
and may be picked up by State
Chairmen on February 13,

Debaters On TV

In Pennsylvania

Next week a W&L debate team
composed of Ed Fitzgerald and John
McMurray will debate at Dartmouth
College in one of the top tourna-
ments in the nation. In route to
Dartmouth they will stop over in
Philadelphia to debate the University
of Pennsylvania on TV.

The program will be telecast by
Philadelphia’s channel 12, and the
subject of the debate is “Resolved,
That the U.S. and Russia should
enter into a defensive alliance against
Red China.” This program, coming
from Philadelphia, will be seen in
all of Eastern Pennsylvania, Dela-
ware, New Jersey, and parts of New
York and Maryland.

This weekend a W&L team com-
posed of Ed Norton and Sam Fra-
zier is at Wilkes-Barre, Pennsyl-
vania for another tournament,

Last weekend a W&L debate team
of John McMurray and Claude Rod-
gers participated in the John Hop-
kins’ 14 Invitational Debate Tourna-
ment in Baltimore. Out of six de-
bates they won three and lost three.

McMurray, the only major de-

record in a tournament, was debat-
ing for the first time on the nega-
tive side this year. Rodgers, a
novice in his first major tourna-
ment was debating for the first
time on the affirmative side.

 

All of the 57 teams representing
52 American colleges debated three
rounds on the affirmative side and
three rounds on the negative side.

i To Conduct
Two-day Seminar

Religion and sociology will be related by Dr. Y. Ephram
Fischoff, a man currently working in both fields, in a two-day
Seminar in Religion on February 11 and 12.

Speaking at public lectures will be Dr. Fischoff of Lynch-
burg, Va., rabbi of Congregation Agudath Sholom and pro-

fessor of humanities and social science at Lynchburg College.
*

“Sociology and Religion” will be
the subject of his first lecture Tues-
day and Wednesday he will use as
his topic, “Religion and Contempor-
ary Social Order.”

Both lectures begin at 7:30 p.m.
in the university’s duPont Auditor-
ium.

Since 1961, three two-day Semi-
nars in Religion have been held dur-
ing the academic year at Washing-
ton and Lee, replacing a once-a-
year Religious Emphasis Week.

These seminars, planned to show
religion’s relevance to other academ-
ic subjects, are sponsored by the
University Christian Association in
cooperation with the academic de-
partment representing the particular
subject under discussion.

Dr. Fischoff’s appearance at Wash-
ington and Lee is being sponsored
by the University Christian Asso-
ciation and the Department of Re-
ligion.

In addition to his lectures, he will
speak in several religion classes and
be available for individual confer-
ences and meetings with small
groups of students.

Besides his religious and academ-
ic work, Dr. Fischoff takes an active
role in community affairs in Lynch-
burg. He has served as chairman of

John Madison, Convention Parade
Chairman, said yesterday that he had
approached the Town Council of
Lexington to proclaim May as “Po-

ton.” Aside from W&L’s convention,
the dedication of VMI’s George Mar-
shall Library will take place in Lex-
ington. Presidents Truman and Eis-
enhower will be in town for this
dedication; there is also a possibility
that Lyndon B. Johnson will leave
the White House to make the trip. In
any case Lexington promises to be
swamped with more prominent po-
litical figures than in any time in
its colonial history.

 

Madison also announced plans
to bring a live elephant to the

A Student Senate?!?

Many students have asked us if the Tuesday edition was
really serious about the idea of a student senate. Unfortunate-
ly, they seem to be and we have no answer to the frequently
asked question, why can’t they be far-sighted enough to see
that such an organization would be unwieldly. Perhaps they
are not practical-minded enough to see that legislation even of
the smallest significance would be seriously stymied by debate
and discussion. The only conceivable advantage we could ever
derive from this structure would be that we would once and for
all discover the frustration and waste that results from bureau-
cracy, when too many people try to get in the act.

The students we elect to represent us in the Executive Com-
mittee are extremely well-qualified and have shown every con-
cern for basing their legislative decisions on student body feel-
ing. What we suggest for the Tuesday edition or any other EC
critics is that rather than painting a rosy picture of some utop-
ian government for W&L, you might be more effective in your
sabotage if you could cite instances where the EC has passed
or failed to pass legislation in direct contradiction to the will or
sentiment of the students as a whole. We also would like to
plead on behalf of our EC that above all you base your criti-
cisms on valid grounds and avoid the false implications (which
to save you embarrassment we shall not cite unless you ask us
to) that you have presented in your editorializing thus far.

Our New Responsibility

With the institution of the new liberalized cut system, this

 

semester represents an experiment in freedom. The spirit be- |)

hind last spring’s student petition, which was the initiating
factor of the new system, was that now the W&L student is ma-

ture enough to assume more individual responsibility. Thus, in |
accepting this greater freedom, we have the duty of living ||

up to our side of the contract by not abusing the privileges that
the faculty in all good faith has given to us.

All students should get a copy of the new absence rules and
read them over very carefully. There are some fine points in
these changes which if you overlook, you can easily fall into
trouble. Also, these added cuts are to be used constructively;
a week’s vacation in Nassau would defeat the whole purpose
of the system. They have been given to us only to provide
greater leeway in our academic pursuits and we are expected
to use them accordingly.

Several years ago, an experiment in liberalized cuts was
conducted with the senior class and it flopped. Unless we accept
these concessions in the spirit with which they were petitioned,
we shall meet the same fate. Our new freedom, if utilized, can
promote greater development and richer fulfillment but if
abused, it is self-defeating and we will have to wait like Moses
and the wandering Israelites for “forty years in the wilderness”
to be given another chance.

The Reign Of The Combo Party

At an IFC-faculty discussion held last fall, among the sub-
jects that fraternity leaders and teachers analyzed was the mat-
ter of combo parties. Almost unanimously, the students ex-
pressed dissatisfaction at the way combo parties were being
overdone, that they were not providing a sufficiently gratifying
or constructive outlet. But when they focused on the possibility
of some alternative activities, discussions came to a halt. There
simply was no other means of entertainment that a fraternity
could join in on as a whole. So the IFC let the problem ride.

Last Wednesday, we had the rewarding experience of talk-
ing with a large number of Hollins girls who were likewise con-
cerned with this weekend problem of finding alternatives to
getting ploughed and nursing hangovers. They seemed to indi-
cate that combo parties and such are all right in their places,
but they should not dominate the whole weekend. What appar-
ently the Hollins girls regret most about our present social
life is that they never in the course of a weekend or Saturday
night get to know their dates.

Well, if neither W&L nor Hollins is really content with
our weekend set-up, who is going to take the initiative to change
it? Here the prospect is grim. Because who, after all, is going
to have the nerve to suggest something different and spontan-
eous? Who would be stupid enough to think that there could
ever be any other meeting ground between us and the girls
colleges than the combo party? Intercollegiate retreats? Panel
discussions? Living room Hootnanies? Seminar sessions?
Weekend softball games? No. How could we ever think of such
things?

‘Sundays And Cybele’ Praised;
Kruger Compared To Olivier

By BOB MOTTLEY |
Sundays and Cybele was an exqui-
site experience for those who could
appreciate it, although I suspect it
would have been
even more effec-
tive in the French
with English sub-
titles. The young
girl, Patricia Goz-
zi, was mature be-
yond her years,
while Hardy Kru-
ger bids fair to
becoming the
Olivier of France.
Cybele was a
definite improve-
ment over his last cinema role—
chasing rhinoceroses in Hatari with
John Wayne.

Laurels in New York are going
to Dr. Strangelove and Tom Jones.
Two films suffered disastrous prem-
ieres: Samuel Bronston’s The Fall
Of The Roman Empire (a dull thud)
and the hideously pornographic
Flaming Creatures that raised a
well-deserved stink in Belgium last
year.

Nine Hours to Rama is_ best
avoided unless one wants to see an
Indian version of The Untouch-
ables. The great Gandhi deserved
more than this from Hollywood.
(Hindus die as they live, calmly,
with imperturable grace, often in
tense misery. Only the last of these
qualifications applies to this

Mottley

 

wretched film. However, by going,

one may at least see unsurpas-
sed comedy sequences from those
long-gone days when humor did
not have to be vulgar and-or
sophisticated.

Judgment At Nuremberg, opening
Sunday at the Lyric, is a distin-
guished film in spite of several minor
flaws. It is better seen as an under-
scoring of Nazi cruelty and sadism
than a comprehensive indictment
of the German nation for its concep-
tual role in World War II. Most of
the film is anti-Nazi; one wishes
that the subcurrent of Germanopho-
bia had been left in the cutting room.
On the first track, the performances
of Spencer Tracy, Marlene Dietrich,
and Judy Garlard are beyond eavil.
A particularly brilliant contribution
is made by Montgomery Clift (of all
people) as a young Jew castrated by
the Nazis. Richard Widmark and
Burt Lancaster rub in the national
guilt approach with an exaggera-
tion that quickly becomes embarras-
sing melodrama. Somewhere be-
tween these extremes is the impas-
sioned defense of Maximillian
Schell—who suffers, albeit brilliant-
ly, from Osear-in-mouth disease or
verbal diarrhea. For me, the finest
sections of the film come when Diet-
rich tries to convince Tracy that not
all of German culture went into a
cesspool with the hegemony of Hit-
ler. Obviously meaning what she
says, Miss Dietrich succeeds admir-
ably. In short, one of the better
Stanley Kramer films.

 

Reinstatement Pressure Over;

Gradin g System Criticized

By DREW BAUR
The end of every semester always
is synonomous with the problem of
reinstatement and failing out. Who
to do what to, or
with is the chief

it gives masters
the leeway of ar-
bitration in grad-
ing, a straight let- |
ter grade, most
students would
agree, gives a mis- |
representation of

problem. Although |

 

 

their work.

Undoubtedly this
has been suggest-
ed before, but if anything is to be}
done about the Washington and Lee |
grading system, there should be)
carefully considered pros and cons|
heard from both students and fac-
ulty.

For a beginning, all final grades!
should be computed in a numerical
average. In some courses with cer-|
tain professors this would be easy;
in others, with professors accustom-
ed to the letter grade, it would pos-
sibly deprive them of the degree of
arbitration which they now enjoy.
However, if a student has a B- av-
erage, the professor would be able
to adjust his grade anywhere be-
tween 80 and 83. At any rate, there
is still some leeway remaining,

In this system any grade of 90 or
better would be considered superior
work. A total average of 85 or bet-
ter would be Honor Roll work, and
80 or better would be Dean’s List.
Work in the 70’s would be satisfac-
tory, with three weeks of cuts given
to men whose total average is better
than 75 and two weeks of cuts given
for averages between 70 and 75. Any

Baur

lower than 60 would mean condi-
tional reinstatement, pending a 75
or better average the following se-
mester. Any average under 60 would
be automatic removal from school.
All graduating students should have
a four year average of 70 or better.

Such a system would do away
with the unfair case of a student
receiving a B in one course and a
C in another for the same numerical
average in each. It would also do
away with the failing out of a man
who may have above a 70 average,
yet was removed because he had
three D’s and two C’s. Finally, it
would ease the job of the reinstate-
ment committee and decrease the

 

sometimes bitter attitudes of those
who were not reinstated.

Perhaps, the above suggested sys- |
tem is not the best one, but there
must be another alternative from)

Due at the Lyric in next two
weeks: Mondo Cane, Jules and Jim,
The Young Philadelphians, Lord of
the Flies, The Magnificent Seven,
This Sporting Life, and Phaedra.

Irate Reader Complains
About Lack of White Space

Dear Sir:

I have no quarrel with Negro en-
tertainers per se, but I do find it
utterly and extremely objectionable
to find pictures of same carried on
front page of your paper—for too
many issues this year! Personally it
makes me want to throw up!

Uncashed Check Prompts
Hot Check Committee Idea

Dear Sir:

“A Gentleman does not lie.” I was
told that a W&L student could cash
a check at any store in Lexington
by identifying himself as such a stu-
dent. However, I couldn’t cash a
check at the flick, the R. E. Lee
Hotel, a drug store, and a restau-
rent (although, at this restaurant
I had previously cashed a check),
Are the owners of these establish-
ments being ungentlemanly by not
living up to their duties, or have
W&L students established such a
reputation among the merchants that
they check themselves when ap-
proached by Washington and Lee
“gentlemen?”

Therefore, I propose that a hot
check committee be set up to assure
that this situation shall not continue
unchecked.

Yours in exile,

EDITOR’S NOTE: The Friday
Edition of the Ring-tum Phi en-
courages all comments from readers
concerning this paper, the school,
and the school’s institutions. When
space permits all letters will be
published without alterations. Let-
ters should be addressed to the
Ring-tum Phi, Friday Edition.

 

In the last issue of the Ring-tum
Phi a courageous expose of the W&L
government was begun by Addison
Brockenrecord. Due to circumstan-
ces beyond his control, Mr. Broken-
record’s pen is now silent, a victim
of the absolute power the EC wields
over student publications. Truly the
good die young.

But the struggle for truth, justice,
and the American way will not end.
This week, I, Addison Brokenup, will
begin a new series to give the
public a blow-by-blow account of
this struggle against the tryanny of
the EC.

We will not be outliberaled, out-
libeled, outcrusaded, nor outshouted
by puppets of the Establishment
writing for other publications. We
will fight in the Commons, we will
fight in the Student Union, we will
fight in the Liquid, we will fight in
the Paramount, we will never sur-
render.

The EC met secretly to prepare a
forthcoming directive to W&L stu-
dents on the subject of continued
smoking: it is to be encouraged no
matter what the cost. This is a
calculated move on the part of the
EC, not only to gain in popularity,
but also to ensure the continuation
of a tradition without which the EC
could not hope to maintain its
strangle-hold on the campus—the

Changes In Absence Rules
Go Into Effect This Year

Several changes have been made in
the absence regulations of the uni-
versity which will go into effect this
semester.

An upperclassman is permitted
three times as many cuts in each
course as there are class meetings
of the course per week if he has a
cumulative grade-point ratio of 1.5
with no grade below C, on his pre-
ceding semester report.

If an upperclass has a cumula-
tive grade-point ratio of .60 at
the end of his sophomore year, of
90 at the end of his junior year,
and if he earned a grade-point ratio
of 1.00 on his preceding semester
report, he is permitted twice as
many absences in each course as
there are class meetings per week.

A second-semester freshman is
permitted as many absences in each
course as there are class meetings of
the course per week if he has
achieved a grade-point ratio of .60
on the work of the preceding se-
mester. Only one cut in each course
is permitted if his grade-point ratio
is below .60.

Finalists in Two Sports Set;
Winter Sports Nearly Over

By TOM

Intramural action through

WHITE
Wednesday of this week has

just about decided the finalists in two of the four winter sports.

In basketball, it looks very much like SAE and Sigma Nu
will meet in the championship game. This should be the game
of the season, pitting offense against defense. Defending cham-
pion SAE has the leading intramural offense, averaging 50

points a game, Sigma Nu, the run-*
ner-up last year, the top defense.
The Sigma Nus have given up but
20.3 points per game.

Upset-minded

Looking for the upset in the bas-
ketball tournament will be Beta and
PiKA. Of the four contenders, Beta
(4-0) is the only one to have al-
ready clinched its division title,
though the others’ remaining game
apiece should not change their un-
beaten marks.

Beta won its league by virtue of
a 44-39 victory over SPE, who had
better luck in its other game this
week, whipping NFU, 64-43. Roy
Stallings led the winners with 16
points. SPE ended the season with a
2-2 record, while NFU was winless,
losing their fourth game to Lambda
Chi, 38-36. NFU had led 36-35 with
less than a minute left, but Lambda
Chi broke the stall and won. Richard
Drew netted 16 points for the win-
ners, who closed out the season at
3-1.

Should ZBT upset SAE, that
league would be thrown into a three-
way tie between ZBT, SAE, and
Delt, who upped its record to 3-1
with a 29-16 victory over Law, 1-3
for the season. ZBT collected a for-
feiture from Sigma Chi to set up the
possibility.

 

 

Boggs is Hero

DU retained a rather unlikely pos-
sibility of topping Sigma Nu in its
league by virtue of an overtime 42-
40 win against Pi Phi. The winners’
Charlie Boggs, who scored 20, sent
the game into overtime with a last
second half-court shot. Pi Phi’s Bill
Manley, with 22, outscored Boggs,
and later hit 14 in a 32-25 victory
over KA, DU remained, at 2-0, un-
defeated, while KA dropped to 0-3.
Pi Phi closed out the season at 2-2.

Kpapa Sig posted a 54-31 victory
over Phi Psi, George Madison pacing
them with 15. Dave Britt, scoring 14,
led the losers, who dropped to 1-2
with a later loss to Phi Kappa Sig,
40-20. Kappa Sig is 2-1; Phi Kappa
Sig closed the season at 2-2.

The best: 1. SAE, 3-0; 2. Sigma
Nu, 3-0; 3. PiKA, 3-0.

Handball

Beta, Delt, KA and PiKA all
clinched handball championships
and spots in the playoffs this week.

Beta reached the finals by defeat-
ing Sigma Chi 4-1. Beta closed at
4-0, Sigma Chi at 2-2. Sigma Chi had
earlier taken a forfeit win over DU,
who closed the season with a 1-3
record.

Phi Delt forfeited to Delt to give

Matmen to Meet N.C. State, Duke

The wrestlers met North Carolina
State this afternoon, and will wrestle
Duke tomorrow. Both teams are
studded with sophomores, and the
Generals will be seeking to repeat
last year’s victories.

In its last match, Washington and
Lee pinned all eight of Richmond
Professional Institute’s wrestlers,
winning 40-0. Coach Dick Miller said
the exam break had hurt the team,
and a week of practices was not
enough to bring it up to that pre-
exam edge.

He said, however, that this week-
end’s two opponents would be in
much the same situation. W&L beat
North Carolina State 19-9 last year,
and defeated the Durham school,
27-5.

Jamie Andrews will wrestle at
147, replacing Tom Stover, a victim

of the automatic rule. The regulars
will wrestle in each of the other
classes.

The junior varsity will wrestle
both opponents prior to the varsity
matches. The Generals thus far this
year have a 4-1-1 overall record.

Miller said of the upcoming sched-
ule, which includes Franklin and
Marshall, Old Dominion, and Vir-
ginia, “Some of our tougher oppon-
ents are coming up.”

By JOHNNY GRAHAM

Come rain or sleet or snow or dark
of night...

The motto of the Post Office De-
partment might just as well apply
to the Washington and Lee football
team’s annual spring practice ses-
sions.

“We're hoping for good weather,
but we never seem to get any,” said
General head coach Lee MeLaughlin
“In past years we've practiced out-
side in snow and the players haven’t
objected to it.”

The spring schedule calls for the
start of practice on February 12.
The session culminates with a full
scale game against the alumni on
February 29, Last season’s seniors
are eligible to play for the alumni,
and if a large enough team can not
be fielded by the old grads, the
varsity will lend them a few from
the regular squad.

About 55 prospects are expected to
show up for the practice, including
about 25 members of last season’s
freshmen team.

The Generals appear to have their
work cut out for them. Sixteen let-
termen were lost from last season’s
squad, including 11 first stringers.

Coach Mac has issued the call for
all players, regardless of whether
they played last year.

“Tm also asking that they be in
pretty good shape. We'll be doing
some scrimmaging every day,” he
said.

The schedule calls for three days

Spring Football Practice To Begin
Despite Traditional Bad Weather

of practice the first week, with
Saturday off. Practice runs Monday
through Thursday the following
week, with no sessions on the 21st
or the 22nd. The following week
there are sessions scheduled for
every day with the spring game
on Saturday. This gives a total of
13 practice days, well below the
maximum of 20 allowed by the
NCAA.

The purpose of having the spring
practice so early is to avoid interfer-
ence with the spring sport seasons.
Unlike bigger schools, a larger por-
tion of W&L’s football players also
participate in spring sports. Players

 

who are out for winter sports which
conflict with the practice schedule
are excused from practice until the
end of the winter sport season.

After suffering the loss of so many
lettermen, the Generals must find
help from underclassmen to fill the
places. Coach McLaughlin is look-
ing to rising juniors Joe Miller,
Tersh Baker, Starke Sydnor, Harry
Brookby and Larry Craig to join
with cocaptains Bill David and Tom
Crenshaw and rising senior Dan
Manson as the nucleus of next sea-
son's team.

W&L Basketballers
Meet R-M Saturday

In their first game since the semes-
ter break, the Generals were romped
by a strong King College team, 77-
59, Thursday night in Bristol, Ten-
essee, in a non-conference game.

Washington and Lee’s cagers face
their toughest test of the season Sat-
urday night when they entertain
Randolph-Macon’s Yellow Jackets at
Doremus Gymnasium.

The Yellow Jackets, Virginia’s
number one small college outfit, are
one of the two best teams on the
W&L schedule, according to Coach
Bob McHenry.

“We figured Catholic and Ran-
dolph-Macon would be our most
rugged games,” McHenry - said.
Catholic beat us, 79-70, and Ran-
dolph-Macon whipped Catholic by
six or seven points. We will have
a tough assignment Saturday.”

Coach Paul Webb’s veteran R-MC
club features a fast-break offense
and the accurate shooting of 6-6
Frank Kaminski and 6-1 Irv Sentz.

“Kaminski is good inside or out-
side,’ McHenry said. “Randolph-
Macon likes to work him in close
so he can get the easy shots. He’s
a top notch rebounder too. In fact,
he could play for almost any college
around.”

Sentz, a junior who “jumps like
a boy 6-5,” aids Kaminski in the re-
bounding department and is deadly
from long range.

schedule coming up, McHenry hopes
his charges can shake their pre-
exam weariness which was a “con-
tributing factor” in five straight loss-
es to RPI, Bridgewater, Western
Maryland, Old Dominion and King
College.

“In order to defeat Randolph-
Macon,” McHenry said, “we will
have to keep them from scoring more
than 60 or 70 points, stay on the
boards, and hit a good percentage of
our shots.”

The Generals have been hitting a
good percentage of their field goal
attempts, but in their four losses be-
fore exams their defense and re-
bounding faltered.

Guard Louie Paterno, who is aver-
aging 18.5 points per game, paces the
Generals’ attack. Guard Don Wallis
with a 10.0 mark and center Bob
Spessard with a 9.5 average back
up Paterno in scoring.

Space Age Industrial Problems Ciacunad At W&L

Kenneth Remington, who has
worked in the government’s Apollo
program to land a man on the moon,
spoke at W&L Tuesday night on the
topic, “Problems in a Technologically
Advanced Industry: Industry in the
Service of Government.”

Remington, director of Technical
Programing, Apollo Engineering
Space and Information Systems Di-
vision of North American Aviation,
Inc., discussed the problems which
industry must face in the era of ex-
panding government purchases.

Primarily, he said that industry
must meet the evolution of govern-
ment needs and that this is most
evident in the aerospace indusry of
which he is a part. To meet this
need, he emphasized that corpora-
tions must reinvest profits in re-
search to keep up with the chang-
ing times.

Using charts of his own company’s
profits, Remington stated that al-

though net profits were rising on the
whole, the per cent of profits was
falling in many industries which
rely entirely on government orders,
which, although large in quantity,
require that a company work on
minimum profits. Remington con-
tinued by noticing that rising costs
had only augmented this problem.
Finally, Remington concluded by
elaborating on the = specialization
which big corporations have in order
to procure government orders. The
actual act of bidding for the gov-
ernment orders has become so com-
plicated, that he said the actual pro-
curement of the order was as diffi-
cult as the production of the final
product.

a date for the weekend has become |
just a part of this institution, he|
added.

Combo parties are perpetuated for
two reasons, Lane commented. First,
we are trapped by the fraternity
image, where individual fraternities
compete for prestige by having wild-
er and more extravagant parties.
Secondly, “there is nothing else to
do.” Because of the lack of cultur-
al advantages in our locale, there is
little variety of activities that can
give the two colleges a common
meeting ground.

Lane concluded by stating that the
problem must be regarded by both
Hollins and W&L as mutual re-
sponsibility. He pointed out that the
solution will come through relating
to each other on a more personal
basis.

(Author of ‘Rally Round the Flag, Boys!”
and ‘‘Barefoot Boy With Cheek’’.)

ARF!

Benjamin Franklin (or The Louisville Slugger, as he is better
known as) said, “A penny saved is a penny earned,” and we,
the college population of America, have taken to heart this sage
advice. We spend prudently; we budget diligently. Yet, despite
our wise precautions, we are always running short. Why? Be-
cause there is one item of expense that we consistently under-
estimate—the cost of travelling home for weekends.

Let us take the typical case of Basil Metabolism, a sophomore
at UCLA majoring in avocados. Basil, a resident of Bangor,
Maine, loved to go home each weekend to play with his faithful
dog, Spot. What joy, what wreathed smiles, when Basil and
Spot were re-united! Basil would leap into his dogeart, and
Spot, a genuine Alaskan husky, would pull Basil all over Bangor,
Maine—Basil calling cheery halloos to the townfolk, Spot
wagging his curly tail.

,

But the cost, alas, of travelling from UCLA to Bangor, Maine,
ran to $400 a week, and Basil’s father, alas, earned only a
meagre salary as a meter-reader for the Bangor water depart-
ment. So, alas, after six months Basil’s father told Basil he
could raise no more money; he had already sold everything he
owned, including the flashlight he used to read meters.

Basil returned to California to ponder his dilemma. One
solution occurred to him—to ship Spot to UCLA and keep him
in his room—but Basil had to abandon the notion because of
his roommate, G, Fred Sigafoos, who was, alas, allergic to dog
hair.

Then another idea came to Basil—a stroke of genius, you
might call it. He would buy a Mexican hairless chihuahua!
Thus he would have a dog to pull him around, and G. Fred’s
allergy would be undisturbed,

The results, alas, were not all Basil had hoped. The chihua-
hua, alas, was unable to pull Basil in the dogeart, no matter
how energetically he beat the animal.

Defeated again, Basil sat down with G. Fred, his roommate,
to smoke a Marlboro Cigarette and seek a new answer to the
problem. Together they smoked and thought and—Eureka!—
an answer quickly appeared, (I do not suggest, mark you, that
Marlboro Cigarettes are an aid to cerebration. All I say about
Marlboros is that they taste good and are made of fine tobaccos
and pure white filters and come in soft pack or Flip Top box.)

Well, sir, Basil and G. Fred got a great idea, Actually, the
idea was G, Fred’s, who happened to be majoring in genetics.
Why not, said G. Fred, cross-breed the chihuahua with a Great
Dane and thus produce an animal sturdy enough to pull a dog-
cart?

It was, alas, another plan doomed to failure. The cross-breed-
ing was done, but the result (this is very difficult to explain) was
@ raccoon.

But there is, I am pleased to report, a happy ending to this
heart-rending tale. It seems that Basil’s mother (this is also very
difficult to explain) is a glamorous blond aged 19 years. One
day she was spotted by a talent scout in Bangor, Maine, and
was signed to a fabulous movie contract, and the entire family
moved to California and bought Bel Air, and today one of the
most endearing sights to be seen on the entire Pacific Coast is
Spot pulling Basil down Sunset Boulevard —Basil cheering and
Spot wagging. Basil’s mother is also happy, making glamorous
movies all day long, and Basil’s father is likewise content, sit-
ting at home and reading the water meter.

Low Comedy

An important part of the play will
be more lighthearted in nature than
the tragical pursuits of Faustus. This
part includes the roles of low com-

Featured in these low comic roles
will be Lockhart Handley who will
play both roles of the Clown and
Robin; Joe Volpe who will play an
Elizabethan Pope; and Lew Davis
who will play Rafe, a mischievous
cohort of Robin’s.

Also in the cast are Jody Luck,
Steve Millard, Guy Glenn, and Bill
O’Neal who will round out the cast
of 23 as the Good and Evil Angels
and sundry vicious devils.

Directing the play is Dr. Cecil

| quarterly, was entitled “Disposition
| of Physical Exhibits Used in Crimi-
| nal Cases,” and it was written from
| an idea suggested to Partington by
| Professor Wilfred J. Ritz of the Law
| School.

| The situation which Partington re-
| searched and wrote about is the
number of convicted criminals who
appeal for retrial from their prison
cells. The points on which these
| men make their appeals are varied—
and in some instances their cases do
come up for retrial—but it may be
years after their conviction. As
Partington points out in his article,
“the question arises as to whether
it is ever safe to destroy or other-
wise dispose of evidence, at least,
until a prisoner has died or been
released from incarceration.”

Keep the Exhibits?

Partington cites cases which have
come up for retrial more than twenty
years after the original conviction
in which the criminals have been
set free because of a lack of evidence
in the new trial. Partington predicts
that there will be more and more
new trials in the future, and that the
problem of preserving the exhibits
used as evidence in the original
trials is becoming more and more of
a necessity, however much a prob-
lem it is.

In researching the problem, Part-
ington sent one hundred and thirty-
five letters to clerks of courts, prose-
cuting attorneys, and others in all
fifty states of the union. Seventy-
six replies were received from forty-
six states, the Alttorney Generals of
the United States and military of-
ficers. There is no uniform statute as
to how long physical evidence must
be kept—and some states have no
statutes at all to this effect.

A [pproach To Desegregation
Topic of Mixed Discussion

By ROGER PAINE
Editor-in-Chief
Desegregation at Washington and Lee was the topic of a
discussion Saturday night at the home Rev. John Fletcher,
Rector of the Robert E. Lee Episcopal Church. A delegation
of students from all-Negro Hampton Institute, Hampton, Va.,

a Negro clergyman, a Negro profes-*
sor, and several W&L students and
faculty members took part in the
discussion.

Jenks and Piney Keynote

Dr. William A. Jenks, Professor of
History, and Dr. Edward L. Pinney,
Associate Professor of Political Sci-
ence, keynoted the discussion. Dr.
Jenks, who was assigned the task of
explaining the position of the W&L
faculty on integration of the school,
explained that it was impossible to
arrive at any solid conclusions as to
W&L’'s position. As far as he knew,
no definite statement had been made
by the Board of Trustees either for
or against integration of the student
body.

Dr. Jenks expressed his own per-
sonal surprise that three schools
which he thought Washington and
Lee would lead in the problem of
integration—Mercer, Stetson, and
Wake Forest—had already made the
advance, leaving W&L as one of the
few leading southern colleges re-
maining segregated. He concluded |

 

possible that it is already too late for |

W&L to do more than respond to}

the inexorable social movement

in the United States with a kind of |

tokenism?
No Negro Applications

Dr. Pinney followed these remarks |

 

line of discussion, saying he felt it
should not be the Negro’s responsi-
bility to take the first step in the
W&L problem. Washington and Lee
should make the first move, he said—
the Negro high school student can
not be expected to apply to a college
which he feels sure would turn
him down because of his color.
Moreover, it was assumed that no
W&L catalogues are sent to Negro
high schools, nor are any of W&L’s
other methods of “sales procedure”
directed toward any Negro secondary
schools. It was pointed out that as
a result, few high school graduates
of the Negro race have a chance to
know anything about W&L.

W&L Silence

A further development from this,
mentioned by a W&L student, was
the statement that W&L’s silence on
the integration issue speaks louder
than any words—until W&L makes
an actual statement of policy, saying
that it will not discriminate against
applicants on the basis of race, no
qualified Negroes can be expected to
apply.

One Negro student expressed im-
patience with the general view of
white people regarding integration:
he said they generally feel that inte-
gration is a “one-way street,” and
that it is only the Negro who is

The Chief of Police of Daytona
Beach, Florida, in an effort to lower
the number of arrests made annually
during Spring Vacation, has released
a list of rules to all prospective
collegians contemplating taking their
coming rest period where the girls
are:

1. Do not drink intoxicating bev-
erages on the streets or sidewalks

2. Do not have intoxicating bev-
erages in your possession if you are
under 21 years of age or attempt to
obtain any by use of false identifi-
cation.

3. Do not start fires on the beach
or any other public property.

4. Do not mark your car with any
writings, designs, figures or pictures
that could be considered obscene
or indecent or dress in a manner that
could be so considered.

5. Do net trespass on private prop-
erty such as motels or hotels with-

 

Brown of R. E. Lee when they met
at a conference in New York spon-
sored by the MHpiscopal Church.
“One of the basic problems in race
relations today is the lack of com-
munication between whites and Ne-
groes,” Rev. Brown commented, “and
we hoped this weekend would help
to alleviate this.”

In order to give the visitors a
well-rounded view of W&L, Brown
asked the administration if they
might attend classes. Permission was
granted, and the individual profes-
sors concerned were asked, in ac-
cordance with the administration’s
wishes, if they had any objections.
Plans were made for the visitors to
stay at the homes of members of
R. E. Lee Episcopal Church.

The weekend started with a dinner
and an informal discussion at the
home of Rev. Brown on Friday
night. In addition to the group from
Hampton, W&L students Rick Bel-
ser, Joel Bennett, Rod Cockshutt,
and Jim Ledbetter attended. The
conversation centered around the
various Negro movements today and
the ways in which they are attempt-
ing to achieve racial equality.

Attended Classes

The W&L students escorted the
visitors to their classes on Saturday
morning. The Roanoke Times com-
mented that it was the first time
since the late Eighteenth Century
that Negroes had attended classes at
Washington and Lee.

The groups met for lunch at the
Robert E. Lee Hotel, and the visitors
were given a tour of the campus on
Saturday afternoon. After supper at
Rev. John Fletcher’s, discussion was
led by Dr. Jenks and Professor Pin-
ney of the Washington and Lee fac-
ulty, which was attended by a large
group of interested students and fac-
ulty members.

Plans are being made to recipro-
cate the visit early in March. Every-
one concerned reported that the
weekend was an unqualified success.
Rev. Brown said that “The discus-
sions and the experiences we had to-
gether were beyond our expecta-
tions.” One of the W&L students
commented that “Many insights were
gained on both sides, many doubts
and fears were dispelled, and many
friends were made.”

We Shall Overcome

You may agree or disagree with the aims and impli-
cations of the current upheaval in civil rights, but we
will guarantee you one thing: you cannot remain silent,
nor can you remain neutral about this issue. The Negro
has asked the nation for his basic rights as an American.
No one can avoid being influenced by his plea. Now is
the time to be counted, and every individual, every
group, and every institution must make a decision for or
against the rights of the Negro. Prolonged silence speaks
louder than any words.

 

It is time for Washington and Lee to take a
stand on the civil rights issue. We feel that two
basic considerations should determine the Univer-
sity’s decision: its duty to its student body, and its
duty to the area which it serves.

The first consideration—W&L’s responsibility to its
students—is a pragmatic one: an education should in-
crease a student’s ability to participate in the present-day
world, Washington and Lee graduates will find themselves
working with Negroes in whatever vocation they may
choose. In business, law, medicine, education, and the arts,
Negroes are finding places as highly skilled and competent
contributors in their own right. Well-trained Negroes are
beginning to compete successfully with white men when
applying for important posts.

It is thus important for white men and women to learn
to work with Negroes without being conscious of the dif-
ference in race. A white lawyer will have to be able to
work with a Negro lawyer on a professional level, and to
do that he will have to be able to look upon his colleague
as a person life himself, educated in his own field, and
not merely as a Negro. Here at Washington and Lee we
as students are being hurt when we allow the University
to postpone this important phase of our education.
Whether we like it or not, the Negro has asserted himself
as capable of contributing in many crucial areas in the
life of our society—the time has come for men of both
races to join forces.

Our Deans take pride in the fact that W&L’s
geographical distribution is diverse. But this is im-
pressive only on the surface: the broad, benevol-
ent hand of our admissions Committee seemingly
must skip over any high school students (how-
ever qualified) whose skin is dark. If Washington
and Lee is ever to be great, it must cease being so
superficial,

W&L will have to make this step soon if it doesn’t
want to be swept through the door at the last moment.
Many schools of our type and in our general area have al-
ready made their decision: Mercer, Stetson, Wake Forest,
Randolph-Macon, Duke, and Sewanee, to name but a
few. With each passing month W&L’s silence is looking
more antiquated, more bigoted, and more embarrassing.
While we have long since lost our chance to be the South’s
first champion of the rights of all men, let us at least
prevent ourselves from looking like the South’s last
sewer of prejudice.

Integration is not a one-way street—we have
as much to gain by drawing Negro students as we
hope they could gain by taking their education
here. W&XL can no longer afford to throw up the
“freedom of association” argument—its super-
ficiality has been pegged and cast aside by greater
institutions than we are. The Negro in this coun-
try has earned his own place in the history, in the
literature, in the past, and in the future of the
United States. We hope that 1964 marks Jim
Crow’s funeral. We hope that in 1964 the Wash-
ington and Lee Board of Trustees will assure the
qualified Negro that he does have a place here. We
hope the Trustees will do this for their own sake,
for the sake of the Negro and for the sake of the
whole University community.

‘Charade’ Highly Praised

For Actors’ Performances

By TOM PACE

“Charade”—a fast moving suspense-comedy starring Audrey Hep-
burn and Cary Grant, with Walter Matthau and James Coburn
featured as co-stars. It is directed by Stanley Donen. The music is
written by Henry Mancini.

The story—Audrey Hepburn is on vacation in Switzerland from
Paris and her husband. She meets Cary Grant, with whom she re-
fuses to become acquainted, as she already knows too many people.
She returns to Paris. Her husband has been murdered. She now
has time for Cary Grant. And for the C.1A., the Paris police, and
three old friends of her husband whom she has never seen before.

Her husband was killed because he had a great deal of money.
His old friends now believe Audrey to have it. And thus the meat
of the story—who has the money and who wants it most—is cluttered
up by a series of delightful murders and bewildering charades. The
climax and the finale are both quite suspenseful, and it is amusing to
try and figure out who is playing what charade.

" The story alone should provide enough interest to entertain most

Keith Wheeler: Peaceable Lane (Sig-
net, $.75).

Peaceable Lane is a dead-end
suburb street near New York’s
Westchester County. Eleven homes
are located on the lane, all priced
around $30,000, all aimed at attract-
ing the middle-income families
whose breadwinners work in New
York City and who want to buy and
settle down. Peaceable Lane’s eleven
families range from doctors and law-
yers to union vice president and a
radio commentator. Three of these
families are Jewish.

At the center of the story is west-
erner Matt Jones, a success in the
New York advertising business,
happy with his wife and his elemen-
tary school aged son. The families
who live on Peaceable Lane do not
have much in common with one
another, so the only thing that binds
any of them together as a neighbor-
hood is their mutual problem with
crab grass. Suddenly their relaxed
world of charcoal-broiled steaks and
car-pools for the kids explodes: one
of the owners on the lane plans to
sell his house to a Negro.

 

Current Literature in Review

 

 

‘Peaceable Lane’ Explores
Limits Of White Prejudice

Reviewed by Roger Paine

Forceful and Exciting

From this point onward, Peaceful
Lane becomes a forceful and excit-
ing novel. Practically every episode
is packed with tension; violence
breaks out often; the people of
Peaceful Lane demonstrate every
facet of prejudice, from being loud-
mouthed bigots to being constrained
non-bigots. The novel itself was a
December choice in 1960 of the
Book-of-the-Month Club, and its au-
thor, Keith Wheeler, is an associate
editor of Life Magazine.

Wheeler's intent is patently didac-
tic—as Time said: Peaceful Lane “is
on somewhat distant terms with lit-
erature, and breathlessly intimate
with today’s headlines.” It is decid-
edly a “topical” novel, and its char-
acters are types. None of the people
in the story actually develop as the
story unfolds—their reactions are
predictable from the start. But de-
spite the stereotypes, the characters
are expertly drawn, offer good range
to the plot, and they are well-
handled through all the explosive
scenes that are a part of the novel.

Negro as Neighbor

Without giving away any import-

ant revelations of the plot, here is
the problem which confronted the
homeowners on Peaceful Lane: one
of their neighbors—a man with
whom none of them had ever gotten
along — is selling his house to
the highest bidder. This bidder hap-
pens to be a rich Negro who wants
to get out of his New York City
apartment with his wife and child.
The people on the lane are disturbed
by the possibility that their homes
may drop as much as $10,000 in their
value if a Negro moves in, They
meet to decide what should be done.

For Matt Jones, the decision be-
comes a particularly painful one, for
he learns the Negro buyer is an
artist named Lamar Winter, whom
he has known and worked with for
seven years in his advertising busi-
ness. Winter himself iis a stereotype:
handsome, arrogant, devoted to his
wife (who is beautiful), father of a
child who is obviously intelligent
and talented. Matt’s problem is how
to cope with the opposing lines of
tension—his friendship to Winter,
and the furor on Peaceful Lane (plus
the very real possibility of a loss

The ‘Nighthawk’ of the Campus

There is no harder man to find
on the Hill—at night—and yet they
say he is always there. The late
studier will catch a glimpse of him
now and then, walking behind the
colonnade or checking the rooms
in Robinson. He never stays long,
disappearing as quietly as he comes.

Those students who do not know
Palmer Eugene Armstrong, W&L’s
trusty night-watchman, have
missed something. To many he is
known affectionately and appro-
priately as “Omni.” That is short
for “omnipresent,” and at times it
seems this name is not far from
right. In his own words: “I get
around,”

Palmer is a rather short, stocky
fellow with two front teeth missing
and a well-chewed Roi-Tan cigar
thrust into the gap. He is seldom
seen without his green hunting
jacket and his old hunting cap.

To my knowledge, he has only

Born in Collierstown, “out Route
No. Two by the reservior,” Palmer
lived there until he joined the
armed services. Since his father
died when Palmer was just eight,
he went to school only through
the sixth grade. He joined the
army at eighteen and served four
years in England. I asked him one
night if he had been a hero in
World War II. He answered simply

“no” and then added with a smile,
“I got out of that; I had a good
doctor.”

As Palmer tells it, he returned to
Rockbridge County after the service,
married, and began work in the
print shop of a Lexington firm.
After several years the firm closed
and on June 8, 1954 (he remembers
the date perfectly) Palmer began his
work for the University. He now
lives with his wife in their home
on Randolph St.

Evaluation of New Hampshire Pollings
Reveals Goldwater Still the Frontrunner

By WYATT B. DURRETTE, JR.

In the realm of politics, as in most
things, prediction is a dangerous
business—even for professionals. For
. an amateur its
_ treacherous: intel-
» lectual suicide you
might say.

With this in
mind I shall still
attempt to exam-
ine activities in
New Hampshire
where  Republi-
can hopefuls and
unhopefuls are
tramping about in
sub-zero weather
in an effort to capture the nation’s
first primary.

In an AP poll released last week
Arizona’s Senator Barry Goldwater
remained unchanged since Decem-
ber as the clear choice of those 26
New Hampshire county committee
members who replied. Thirty-three
were polled.

To the question—“‘whom do you

 

Durrette

consider the strongest GOP candi-
date against President Johnson
now?”—the replies were as follows:
Goldwater — 14; Rockefeller — 3;
Goldwater-Rockefeller even — 2;
Lodge—2; Nixon—1; undecided—4.

Who Will Be Nominated?

A second question—‘who will be
nominated in July?” — produced
these results: Goldwater—7; Nixon—
3; Lodge—2; Rockefeller—1; Scran-
ton—1; undecided—12. These find-
ings support those of Bruce Mac-
Donald, State Chairman of New
Hampshire for the Mock Convention,
who reports that Goldwater main-
tains his position as frontrunner.

But for every poll which says yes,
you can, if you search, find one
which says no—politics is no excep-
tion. So when workers for Gold-
water and Rockefeller plumbed the
N. H. depths last month only to find
that Lodge was the fair haired one,
no one was surprised except guess
who? Yep. Barry and Rocky and no
wonder—he’s working for the Dem-
ocrats.

Divided Allegience

Prominent N. H. Political figures
have divided their alligence. For-
mer Governor Robert Blood and
former U.S. Sen. Robert Upton are
counted in Rockefeller’s corner:
while former Governor Lane Dwinell
and U.S. Sen. Norris Cotton sup-
port Goldwater.

In declaring for Goldwater Dwinell
remarked, “I can support Barry
Goldwater because my experience
as Assistant Sec. of State (under
Eisenhower) convinces me of the
soundness of his approach to our na-
tion’s foreign affairs.” Dwinell was
an Eisenhower delegate to the con-
vention of 1952 and 1956.

Rough Edges

Senator Goldwater’s campaign was
initially disappointing to some of his
supporters, but as the rough edges
became tempered by experience
some of the misgivings departed. One
thing was clear: despite many re-
ports to the contrary the Senator had
not been building his campaign ma-

Racial Parley
Examines
Rights Issue

(Editor’s Note: This weekend
three Washington and Lee students
and a_ professor attended “The
Second American Revolution”
Conference at Bryn Mawr and
Haverford colleges in Pennsyl-
vania. The conference was a three-
day examinations of the current
civil rights movement, and the fol-
lowing is the first in a series of
articles about the conference and
the light it shed on the civil rights
movement.)

By TRACY HARRINGTON
Managing Editor

Over 500 students from colleges
throughout the country gathered at
Bryn Mawr and Haverford colleges
this past weekend
to study the efforts
now being made to
improve the Ne-
gro’s position in
society and to
consider the ef-
fects of these ef-
forts on the whole
of American so-
ciety.

Sponsored joint-
ly by Byrn Mawr
and Haverford, the
conference boasted an impressive
line-up of speakers. The leaders of
nearly all the major civil rights
groups were there, speaking before
the delegation of Negroes, whites,
and orientals.

Dr. John Hope Franklin, chairman
of the history department at Brook-
lyn College, keynoted the conference
Friday afternoon when he spoke on
“The Civil Rights Revolution: His-
torical Setting.” Dr. Franklin, often
considered the leading Negro edu-
cator in the United States, empha-
sized what he called the “intellec-
tual ingredients” which are neces-
sary for any social change and which
he felt prevailed in the current revo-
lution for Negro rights.

Two panel discussions followed
Franklin’s speech, the first of which
was of particular interest to those of
us who were from the South. The
National Director of CORE (Con-
gues on Racial Equality) James Far-
mer debated with Kilpatrick, editor
of the Richmond News-Leader and
author of The Case for Segregation
in the South. Kilpatrick attempted to
defend the Southern position, while
Farmer concentrated his efforts
largely on refuting Kilpatrick’s
claims of racial inferiority and the
property rights argument against
legislative action.

Sympathies of the delegation were
obviously not with Kilpatrick, who
lost his temper a number of times
and faired rather badly in argument
with the more articulate Farmer.

The most thought-provoking por-
tion of the conference, to me, occured
during the second panel discussion
when William Worthy, a spokesman
for the Freedom, Now Party and
correspondent for Afro-American
debated Rev. C. Tindale Vivian,
leader of the Southern Conference
Educational Fund (SCEF), which led
the activities in Birmingham and has
been intimately involved in rights
agitation in the South.

Worthy is an embittered, disillu-
sioned Negro intellectual who sees
no hope for the American Negro
until a complete national economic
and political revamp occurs. He is
essentially a marxist, has visited
Cuba and Red China in spite of gov-
ernment travel bans, and proposes
that Negroes accept the assistance of
Moa Tse Tung in their battle for
freedom. Worthy has lost all faith in
what he called the “bourgeois” ori-
entation of current civil rights
groups; indeed, he has lost all faith
in America itself.

Vivian, on the other hand, is
very much an optimist. He has seen
results (so he claims), and denies
emphatically Worthy’s charge that
civil rights groups don’t appeal to
the rank and file of American Ne-
gros. What Vivian asserts is that the
issues must be pushed, that the civil
rights battle can be won only if
the Negros base their fight on civil
justice for all and do not emphasize
their “Negro-ness.” He is avidly
anti-Black nationalism.

The two men found no common
ground of agreement, for they are on
opposing ends of the civil rights
movement,

Saturday morning was taken up by
a third panel discussion. James
Forman, Executive Secretary of the
Student Nonviolent Coordination
Committee (called SNCC, pronounc-
ed “snick”) joined with NAACP
Labor Secretary Herbert Hill and
William Higgs, Congressional Ad-
visor on Civil Rights Legislation. A
representative of the justice depart-
ment also participated.

Generals To Build N ew Athletic Facilities

New Gymnasium Planned;
Where, When Not Known

By JIM CROTHERS

Tuesday Sports Editor
President cole affirmed today in an exclusive interview with
the Tuesday Sports Editor that there are plans for new athletic
facilities at Washington and Lee. However, Dr. Cole also re-
vealed that no definite plans have been reached as to where
the new gym would be located, when construction would be

 

K

initiated, or even what the new plant*
would consist of.

“The only thing definitely decided
at this point,’ the President con-
tinued, “is that the Board of Trustees
has consented to allow certain speci-
fications to be submitted to an archi-
tect.” Dr. Cole, well-known as a
sports enthusiast himself, said that
several things are needed on campus
and a new gymnasium is definitely
one of these.

It has been know nthat the W&L
Physical Education department has,
for several weeks, been compiling
facts and figures about what they
would like to have incorporated in a
new gymnasium. President Cole as-
serted that plans for new facilities
were not secret, but that little has
been said simply because little is
known at the present, except that
Washington and Lee will, in the not-
too- distant f future, have a new gym.

Coach McHenry
Resigns Post

Will Coach LVC

Varsity basketball and_ lacrosse
coach, Bob McHenry, announced to-
day his tentative resignation from
the Washington and Lee athletic de-
partment in order to accept a similar
position at the Lebanon Valley Col-
lege in Pennsylvania.

McHenry, whose brother is athletic
director and football coach at Leb-
anon Valley, stated that it would be
“hard to leave” W&lL, but that his
resignation, which will become ef-
fective in June, was to “see if I could
really coach.”

Washington and Lee athletic direc-
tor, E. P. “Cy” Twombly said that
the Generals are in the process of
looking for a replacement, but that
so far, no decision has been reached
as to McHenry’s successor.

A graduate of W&L in 1956, Mc-
Henry returned to Lexington in
1958 after serving as _ assistant
basketball coach at Swarthmore Col-
lege and freshman coach at the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania. While play-
ing for the Generals, McHenry let-
tered in both lacrosse and basketball,
co-captained the 1954-55 cage team
and was named Most Valuable Play-
er by his teammates in 1955-56.

 

Mynttinen Sets Rifle Mark

John Mynttinen, sophomore rifle
ace, broke the Washington and Lee
school record for the prone position
with a score of 100-8x as the Gen-
eral shooters tied William and Mary
College 1356-1356 in a rifle match
held December 14 on the W&L firing
range.

Hoopsters Lose

To RMC, 103-57

By TOM CARPENTER
Tuesday Sports Writer

One record was broken and one
tied as the Randolph-Macon Yellow
Jackets cruised to a 103-57 victory
over Washington and Lee Saturday
on the losers’ court. For the Gener-
als it was the worst performance of
the year.

Frank Kaminski, the Macon center,
scored 27 points to set a new stand-
ard at Randolph-Macon for points
scored in a four-year career. He
has totaled 1,743 points since he be-
gan his playing days at the Ashland,
Va., school. Also, the victor’s 103
points tied the record for number
of points in Doremus Gymnasium.

The Yellow Jackets moved ahead
6-4 early in the game and were
never headed after that. In the sec-
ond half they substituted freely

after taking a 59-22 advantage to

the locker room at halftime.
Kaminski was high scorer for

either team and would have had

more had he remained in the game.
At half time his total was 22. Irv
Sentz had 20 and Stan Trimble added
19. Lou Paterno paced the Generals
with 19.

The shooting percentages give one
reason for the lopsided score. Macon
hit on almost 50 per cent of its shots,
while the Generals were successful
on only 22.5 percent.

Tonight the Generals entertain
Roanoke College here at 8:00. Roa-
noke, led by sharpshooting guard
Monty Creggar, will be heavily fav-
ored to add another victory to its
11-4 record.

 

Frosh Cagers Down AMA;
Morrison Scores 25 As
Powell And Ogilvy Shine

In a wild, fast-breaking game yes-
terday, Washington and Lee’s fresh-
men basketballers downed Augusta
Military Academy, 87-79. The high
scoring contest saw both teams ripple
the cords in W&L’s Doremus Gym-
nasium, as the Generals grabbed
their sixth win in eight contests.

Tom Ramie of AMA led all scorers
with 37 points; Frank Morirson
scored 25 tallies to lead the home
victors as Roy Powell and Dave
Ogilvy, both with 20 points, followed
him closely in the individual scor-
ing. The Generals’ Mike Saunders
tallied 11 points, but was also out-
standing as a playmaker and team
leader.

‘W&L Bows To NC State

Then Beats Duke, 21-13

Too many exams and too much Fancy Dress took its toll
on the General wrestlers this weekend as the grapplers split
matches with North Carolina State and Duke, losing to the
Wolfpack before downing the Blue Devils on Saturday.

In the first match of the weekend trip, pins by Dick
Musick and Pete Winfield, and a 5-0 decision by Butch West

JV Wrestlers
Suffer Setbacks

By DICK DeWAUGH
Tuesday Sports Writer

While the varsity wrestlers were
gaining a split in their matches with
North Carolina State and Duke, the
junior varsity grapplers gained little
more than experience in dropping
matches 29-3 to Duke and 31-3 to
N. C. State.

Jim Burton was the only JV win-
ner in the State match as he edged
his 130-pound opponent, 7-6. Bruce
Builder, in the 123 pound class, lost
his match in the third period on
riding time, by the close score, 11-10.

Graeme Bannerman and Jim Tyler,
in the 147 and 167 pound classes re-
spectively, both lost close matches.
Bannerman lost 10-8 as his oppon-
ent put on a third period surge
to down the W&L man, while Tyler
battled his man to an 11-7 score

before getting caught and pinned in|

the second period.

In the Duke match, Bannerman
gained Washington and Lee’s only
victory by outpointing his oppon-
ent, 5-1. Tom Crenshaw, General
heavyweight fought a good match
and was leading 5-4, before getting
pinned,

Although his junior varsity prote-
ges did not fare too well on this
trip, Coach Miller pointed out that
the match experience will actually
be of more importance to many of
his freshmen than the score.

| State, but the men from Raleigh
gained 13 points in the three re-
maining bouts to capture the match,
19-13.

With only a week of practice since
exams, the W&L wrestlers seemed
to suffer from lack of conditioning.
Musick and Winfield were particu-
larly impressive, however, as Musick
pinned his opponent in 36 seconds
and Winfield built up a 14-3 point
advantage before gaining the fall
in his 157 pound bout.

From State the Washington and
Lee team journeyed to nearby Duke
(who had recently beaten N. C.
State) where Coach Dick Miller’s
crew came alive and trounced the
favored Blue Devils, 21-13.

Before Duke could gain a decision,
W&L amassed 13 points with West,
in the 123 pound class, gaining a
7-4 win, Musick a forfeit, and Kem-
ble White, a much improved 137
pounder, a second period pin.

Jamie Andrew then lost his 147
pound match to Duke’s Bob Holder,
but Winfield came back to win his
seventh match of the season, 9-3.
Captain Herb Smith added five more
match points in his 177 pound match
by pinning Warren Seagreaves in the
first period.

Students Confer

(Continued from page 2)

Each of the four men involved
dealt with their special areas of the
civil rights issue: Forman with non-
violent action, Hill with the employ-
ment dilemma among Negros, Higgs
with the civil rights bill, and the
justice department representative
with the problem of judicial involve-
ment in Southern disputes.

Delegates Saturday afternoon par-
ticipated in small seminars on var-
ious areas of civil rights, including
education, non-violence, prejudice,
and the role of the federal govern-
ment.

The conference closed Sunday
morning with a rather disjointed and
poorly organized delivery by Howard
Zinn, Southern Historian and leader
of SNCC.

The singularly most important

of real estate value, which none of
the homeowners on the lane can
financially afford).

Blockbuster Activities
As the Atlantic said of Matt Jones,

his “impulsiveness, his hitting out, |

and later his self-doubts and renun-
ciation are what give this books its
integrity.” The story moves through
the trials which all the families on
the lane must face, the abuse which
Winter must take, and the nefarious
activities of the blockbuster—in this
case, a Negro who tries to convince
the homeowners on the lane to sell
at cheap prices so that he may in
turn sell the homes to Negroes at
an immense profit.

Peaceful Lane is a tense, violent
novel—far from great, but highly
interesting. It does not bring any
new message to the fore—it leaves
the problem of the Negroes mixing
in “exclusive” white neighborhoods
right where it is now. But it opens
up the problem very well and gives
it a needed airing—and the reactions
which the people on Peaceable Lane
have are probably realistically sug-
guested. As Zack Gold, Matt’s next
door neighbor ruefully remarked in
the novel: “The thing I hate to re-
member is that it opened up the
weakness and meanness in all of us.”

anymore.”

I have found that the best way
(possibly the only way) to get to
know “Omni” is to ask him about
his experiences as a night-watchman.
At first he may seem reluctant to
talk about them, but soon he can
be coaxed into some great tales.
One of the best is about the night
he caught some students painting
“Old George” on top of Washington
Hall. Then there was the night he
caught some townies looting cars
parked around the campus. I asked
him if they put up much of a fight.
He thought for a minute and an-
swered, “I don’t really know. I just
got the license number and the po-
lice brought them in. They didn’t
even thank me for it either.”

Then there was the night Palmer
caught them painting “Old Cypress,”
as he calls the well-known statute.
The best of his stories unfortunately
can not be printed here. There is
one about the VMI cadet and his
date who....But then, you had bet-
ter ask Palmer himself.

thing about the conference was that
it revealed just how big and intense
is the civil rights movement. The
dedication o fie people involved in
the various organizations borders
on—and, indeed often becomes—
fanaticism.

I came away convinced that the
American Negro simply is not going
to tolerate the indignation of dis-
crimination much longer. Their pa-
tience seems to be runing short, and
their militancy is increasing. Some
of the graups such as the NAACP,
CORE, and SCEF are struggling to
remove inequality and discriminatory
practices within the framework of
the American Structure. Others—
such as Worthy’s Freedom, Now Par-
ty and the Black Muslims des-
paired of the white man’s callous-
ness and are turning increasingly
to more radical channels of expres-
sion,

The upheavals of the last year,
especially, will get worse before they |
get better. At present, most Negro
leaders seem to have asserred the
situation and are aware of the com-
plexities of social change. Most of
them, in fact, are working with the
white community to realize the
American ideal of equality. Others—
and their numbers are growing—
have withdrawn from a harsh reality
and are themselves contributing de-
structively to the whole dilemma of
racial relations.

In the next few weeks I shall at-
tempt to explore the position of the
various groups involved in the civil
rights movement and to analyze the
essential issues which are to be con-
fronted.

He, and those advising him, have
made mistakes which probably cost
him some support. A question which
the taciturn Granite Staters are yet
unwilling to answer is: has the per-
sonal exposure to the Senator’s
views—especially his hard line for-
eign policy—turned them from him?

Many argue, however, that this
same candor wihch endears him to
many voters causes others to react
increduously. For Barry Gold-
wate—like him or not—is demand-
ing of Americans something which
other presidential aspirants have
preferred we not do: think.

His dynamic conservatism is chal-
lenging the root assumptions of
contemporary political thought—as-
sumptions which have remained
clothed in a sacred shroud since
the 1930’s. To a people who have
become accustomed to the vargaries
and evasions of modern politicians
this is a large order.

rector were not satisfied with a
bare outline. Rather they have filled
the film with clever, interesting, and
amusing scenes—some of which are
integral to the plot and others which
are not, but are simply too good to
leave out.

There are also many superb lines.

Grant into coming into her room,
and he is refusing, she says “You

plies “Nothing.”

demic interest without the pressure
of white racists.

This brought the conversation
around full-scale to Dr. Jenk’s orig-
inal question: is it possible for there
to be any more than token integra-
tion at Washington and Lee? Will
we not be falling in with the inev-
itable stream of the 1960’s when we
do announce the falling of the race
barrier here?

regional warehouse exclusively for
the storage of criminal exhibits or
the use of more photographs are
possible solutions,” Partington sug-
gested in his article. It is obvious
that if the exhibits are not kept,
“an unmerited acquittal may well
result.” Partington added that if ex-
hibits are not kept, there must at
least be uniform statutes placing a
limitation on the length of time after
after a trial that an appeal could be
made.

‘Charade’ Drawn To Suit
Personalities Of The Stars

burn. Their personalities carry the
film in that the film seems to have
been drawn to fit them. Here, in
“Charade,” is one of those rare times
when a star can be superior to an
actor.

This is not to decry the others
who have come together for this ef-
fort. Indeed, the direction is fast
and lively and leads one into a feel-
ing of light suspense. The support-
ing actors are each excellent in their
parts. And the music is by Mancini.
Perhaps the best one can say about
the film is that, finally, a movie
has been made in which Mancini’s
music is not the best thing.

Also coming this week is “Winter

which I haven’t seen. But I will see
it and I imagine I am safe in recom-
mending it to you.

Stewart, led Duke’s Luke Sharpe,
4-1, before getting caught and pin-
ned by the 6-6, 245 pounder. Stew-
art had “Big Look from Dook” in
a cradle hold and came very close
to pinning Sharpe, but the W&L
wrestler’s lack of size hampered him
and allowed the bigger man to
escape.

The split in these two matches
gives the Mink grapplers a 5-2-1
seasonal record with several im-
portant matches remaining. This sat-
urday W&L meets Franklin and
Marshall College in Doremus Gym-
nasium at 8:00 in a match that could
prove very exciting since F&M pro-
vided one of the General’s two

CLUB &
CAMPUS

BY 0. E. SCHOEFFLER, ESQUIRE'S Fashion Director

By now you're back at the salt mines after the holidays—and quite
likely in the mid-season doldrums! Your wardrobe’s probably in the
doldrums, too—standing in the need of replenishment. Here are
some suggestions for putting a little new life and color into that closet!

   

BREATHES THERE A MAN —with
soul so dead he really thinks he’s got
enough sweaters? Well, if you’re among the
‘sweatered souls who are very much alive
to the need, you might consider a camel
hair (or camel color) cardigan—guaran-
teed to go-with-everything! Or you might
' like to turn turtle, in one of the new flat-
knit (jersey-textured) sweaters with the
popular oversize turtle neck. Or perhaps
you'd prefer a bulky ski-type pullover pat-
terned with Norwegian designs — great
even if you never get nearer the slopes than
the Student Union! Any one of these would
give you a lift!

 

THE VEST’S THE BEST—way to revitalize a suit or sport-
jacket-and-slacks you’ve grown tired of. Color is your cue here, with
a wide range of bright flannel vests that will blend or contrast—vivid
reds, brilliant yellow or gold, rich mossy green and—stop me if
you’ve heard this!—the ever-present camel! A colorful Tattersall
check vest is an even more versatile addition to the weary wardrobe,
as it combines well with a variety of colors and fabrics for a smart,
sporting look.

MUFFLED UP TO THE EYES— is a good way to be this sea-
son—if it’s one of those 5-foot knitted mufflers! New they’re not—
we cribbed them from the inmates of English colleges and “public
schools,” where they’ve been worn since the days of Dickens. Ribbed
or flat-knit in soft Shetland wool, these mufflers are often wide-
striped—usually in school colors—though they’re available in solids
as well. Worn without a topcoat—weather permitting—is the British
way, with the long end thrown carelessly over the left shoulder. For
more conservative occasions, think about a soft cashmere muffler in
muted tones, or an authentic tartan to go with your topcoat,

YOU'LL GET A BELT—maybe two—out of the latest! Because
the latest is the reversible fabric belt, solid-color twill on one side,
striped on the other. Or you can add color to your mid-section with
a bright tartan belt, leather-backed to wear well. And bold, blazer
stripes will be running rings around your waist, too, in combinations
like scarlet and white on an olive twill background.

WILD AND WOOLY — is the Word on winter shirts! They may
be either all-wool or a practical blend of polyester fibers and wool
for the warmth you may need during the wintry weeks ahead. They're
styled exactly like your dress shirts—complete to the button-down
collar bit. Look for them in wild, punchy colors and tartans (authen-
tic or otherwise) and jazz.up those bleak, January days!

 

 

 

 

 

AND SO TO BED—or to bull session. Whatever your after-
hours activities, you’ve probably already discovered that those drafty
dormitory corridors can be quite a shock when you're unprepared!
But you can beat the draft if you’ve got a warm flannel robe. Stand-
ard, conservative styling is best—perhaps with contrasting piping—
in practical, dark shades or bright tartan plaids. Barefoot in the halls
—cold and uncarpeted as they are—will lead only to amputation!
Slippers are a better idea, preferably plain, moccasin-style slip-ons.
And if you’re really in the northern latitudes, consider slippers lined
with shearling to fight the frostbite!

Next month we'll keep you in style for active sports—North and

 

South, from ski to shining sea—and intermediate stops. See you then!

Campaign managers for the seven
major GOP hopefuls were an-
nounced today by the Steering Com-
mittee of Washington and Lee’s Mock
Convention.

They are Bill Burke, Senator
Goldwater; Steve Hibbard, Gover-
nor Rockefeller; Jack Yarbrough,
Richard Nixon; Jud Reis, Governor
Romney; George Craddock, Margaret
Chase Smith; Doug McDowell, Gov-
ernor Scranton; and Walter Bennett,
Henry Cabot Lodge.

The student campaign managers
will be campus contacts for the na-
tional headquarters of each of the
candidates, and will make sure that
each of the possibilities comes fully
to the attention of the student body.
Convention chairman Phil Sharp
pointed out that the presidential
candidates may take more than usual
interest in the W&L convention as
an indicator, due to the muddled
situation in the upcoming primaries.

The W&L convention, Sharp said,
will be especially significant as a
prediction because the large number
of candidates entering the primaries
will prevent their being decisive
tests.

In an interview with the Friday
Ring-tum Phi the new campaign
managers discussed the chances of
their candidates to be picked as

 

FRIDAY

W&L’s choice for the eventual nom-
ination by the GOP.

Burke Claims Lead

‘From all indications we have
excellent support from the student
body and throughout the country,”
commented Burke, speaking of Sen.
Goldwater’s campaign. “In a_ poll
taken last week, Goldwater con-
trolled 82 per cent of the GOP lead-
ers.”

Burke is chairman of the Arizona
delegation to the Mock Convention.
The campaign committee under his
direction gives every indication that
the Arizona Senator will receive
the same enthusiastic support in
Lexington which he has obtained all
over the country. Burke said that
two floats have been planned. One
will carry posters and statues of
the Senator; the other will be full
of girls, one of whom may be Gold-
water’s daughter, Peggy.

Burke, who has talked with Gold-
water twice already, said he plans
to go to Washington next week to
speak further with the leading can-
didate.

On the committee controlling
Goldwater’s campaign in Lexington
are John Heinzerling, Art Broadus,
Bob Henley, Jere Cravens, Jim
Culp, Leyburn Mosby and J. D.
Humphries.

 

“We can expect to carry the South
and most of the West. However, Cal-
ifornia is the key state in the race.
At the moment its delegation
votes are split between Goldwater
Rockefeller and Nixon. With a vic-
tory here we will carry the North-
west.”

Hibbard Booms Rocky

Steve Hibbard agreed, but believes
the New York Governor’s chances
“are equal now and will get better.”

“He is far from being overshadow-
ed, as evident by the greater recep-
tion he received from the USS.
Chamber of Commerce last week
when he addressed that body.” Gold-
water had spoken to the group a
week earlier.

“We're in constant touch with the
Rockefeller Headquarters and I plan
to speak with the Governor in the
next few weeks. We would like to
have him down for the convention
but everything depends on his cam-
paign schedule.”

Brice Gamber is the Vice-chair-
man of the Rockefeller-for-President
committee and he is being assisted
by Dick Krietler.

The third key figure in the vital
California race is former Vice-Pres-
ident Richard Nixon. His campaign
manager, Jack Yarbough, was not
available for comment.

Will Confer With Scranton.

Another often-mentioned
date Pennsylvania’s Governor
Seranton. However, Doug McDowell,
his local manager and chairman of
the Pennsylvania delegation to the
convention, said
he is not an announced candidate,
but has said he would
honest and sincere draft. He has
given no official support to his cam-
paign, but this has not discouraged
his many supporters. I intend to talk
with him on the 22nd of February,

Romney has not an-

ager, is almost as indefinite as the
Governor.

“T have no formal campaign plans,
however, you can be assured that
if Governor Romney announces his
intention to seek the nomination,
he will receive a vigorous campaign
at the Mock Convention.”

Mrs. Smith’s Campaign Informal

Senator Margaret Chase Smith is
the first woman who has ever made
a serious attempt for the presidency.

George Craddock, has taken the

same informal manner which has
characterized his candidate.

“Senator Smith threw her petti-
coat into the ring a little over two
weeks ago and pledged herself to
a campaign based on her previous
record, without the use of buttons
stickers, posters, etc. One real asset
I see in her is a woman’s ability
to haggle at a Summit conference.
Even a cool man like Mr. K. will be
swayed by her tears.”

When asked if Mrs. Smith might

Craddock answered, “We're running

An Unjust Attack

We congratulate the Tuesday Edition’s unpopular and
hence courageous stand on integration, but at the same time
would like to correct some misgivings which it presented in
its editorial. First of all, it was entirely unfair in its charge
that the W&L Admissions Committee ‘must skip over any
high school students (however qualified) whose skin is dark.”
The truth of the matter is that no Negro has ever submitted
a completed application for admission to this University. (A
Negro student did begin the process of applying to W&L|_
at one time, but did not go through with his application, and the |ff
Admissions Office heard nothing else of him.) Thus, theoret- |j
ically at least, we have no evidence that W&L is a segregated

institution.
Secondly, we question why

to W&L. If he should matriculate at the University, more
than likely there would be no serious repercussions within the
student body or faculty. However, the Negro himself would
find the going tough. For example, he could scarcely expect
to find any favorable degree of social acceptance. Because of
the restrictive clauses of many of the national fraternities, he
would be unable to rush the majority of houses; needless to
say his dating life would be severely limited; he would have

difficulty in establishing many

outside the academic sphere would be extremely restrictive and

ungratifying.

What would happen if a Negro should apply? Dean At-
wood states that in all probability the application of a Negro
student would be duly processed by the Office of Admissions,
and if the student were academically qualified, the case would
be referred to President Cole or the Board of Trustees. But
as it stands now, there is no reason to believe that any qualified

applicant would be turned away

a Negro would want to apply |!

close friends; in general, life

from W&L on the basis of race.

 

Filet Mignon In

The annual freshman griping about the food in the Com-
mons has been conspicuous by its absence. Of late there has
been an unusual scarcity of complaints about the fare served
up by the W&L Slater System. Why? The answer is a dual
one: a new administration in the Commons, and the effective
functioning of a student ““Food Committee.”

Since the arrival in December of William Albright as man-
ager of the Commons, there has been a very noticeable im-
provement in the quality of the food, the care given to its
preparation, and the willingness of the staff to please the diners.
Perhaps most important is the novel availability of all the milk
you can drink. Another gesture was Mr. Albright’s opening
the dining hall nightly during exam period to serve free coffee.
And in the pre-Albert days, what was so rare as a hot roll? It

is almost unbelievable that a

make so much difference; we hope the improvement will con-

tinue.

Mr. Albright has been kept

complaints by a four-man committee headed by dorm counselor
Bob Henley. The Food Committee, formed last year as a sop
to freshman rioting, has been meeting regularly and has worked
very well to initiate needed changes in food and service.

The end result is that the freshmen can still be counted on
to throw food on occasion; but the quality of the food being
thrown is much better, and there is less (if any) cause to

throw it.

‘Ivy Revolutionaries’ Stage Protest

By DREW BAUR

Under the ominous shadow of a
hill, the Ivy Camouflaged Revolu-
tionaries held their
first meeting of
the year. Mr. Ivy
had called this
special meeting
beeause they had
run out of revolt-
ing topics and
needed new ma-
terial. He opened
the meeting with
the prologue to
Mein Kampf.

Following the
invocation, Racy Ivy was the first
to speak. He was a_ professional
rebel who had been frustrated in
the power struggle involving the
building of a drinking fountain in
the Liberty Hall Library. Now he
had hit upon a sensational thought—

an attack upon motherhood because |
it did not give him a freedom of

choice with regard to the color of

him to rise up and shoot his mother
because she was obviously biased
to white-eyed children. Having
spoken, Racy took his seat, dreamily
thinking of bloodshot eyes and the
large amount of parking space be-
hind the gym.

Chosen to second his proposal was
the mysterious Addison Ivy. Addie,
as he was affectionately called by his
fellow Friars, had been thwarted by
a strong central government which
had obviously been malicious and
unmerciful in all of its actions. Ad-
dison mentioned that, although he
was not quite sure why he objected
to motherhood, Racy’s words were
good enough for him,

Mr. Ivy wholeheartedly agreed
with the suggestion and decided that
motherhood was a prejudiced organ-
ization which should be suppressed.
He ended the meeting by leading
his subsidized revolters in the un-

 

constitutional school prayer.

Editor-in-Chief

One of the most explosive issues
in our society since the impact of
World War II has'|
been the pub-
lication of the fa-
mous “Kinsey re-
ports.” An exten-
sive study by Dr.
Alfred Kinsey and
his associates of
the Institute for
Sex Research at
Indiana Universi-
ty, this two-vol-
ume research rep-
resented quite an
eye-opener on American sexual be-
havior.
Among the more shocking discov-
eries of the Kinsey team were that
85 per cent of the total male popu-
lation had had premarital inter-
course; an estimated 50 per cent

of married males had had extra-

Sexual Revolution—Part I

 

marital intercourse; some 70 per cent
of males had had relations with pros-
titutes.

In addition, the survey revealed
that 64 per cent of the female popu-
lation had “responded to orgasm by
one means or another prior to mar-
riage;” 45 per cent had had premari-
tal intercourse; among college gradu-
ates, the number of wives who ad-
mitted to extramarital intercourse
was 29 per cent.

The publication of these statistics
in 1953 merely authenticated what
many observers had already de-
tected in our society’s undercur-
rents, that is, we were experienc-
ing a critical transition later to be
labelled the “Sexual Revolution.”
Partly due to the impact of the
War, partly to the growing skep-
ticism of liberalized education, we
have over the past two decades
very decidedly dispelled the Puri-
tanical hangover that so long has
pervaded the American outlook.
Traditional Christian morality has
been deemed unrealistic, totally
out of tune with the facts of hu-
man behavior. In its place is the
more liberal philosophy that each
person first know himself, and only
on the basis of this self-awareness
can he validly set up rules of per-
sonal conduct.

In this modern search for man as
he really is, it is found that one of
the most powerful of human desires
is, indeed, the sex desire. Under its
influence, men developed keenness of
imagination, courage, persistence,
and creative ability, unknown
to them at other times. Under its
influence, civilizations have risen to
great heights of achievement.

 

Throughout Western history, for ex-

ample, those societies which have
offered the strongest enlightenment,
the most advanced cultures, have
fostered sexual activity as one of its
basic activating stimuli. This gener-
alization is true with Egypt, Babylo-
nia, Greece, Rome, Renaissance Italy,
and Romantic England. On the other
hand, those societies in which sex-
ual behavior has been subject to
extreme repression have been mark-
ed by striking cultural sterility. Ex-
amples of the latter are Medieval
Europe and Victorian England.
Since the sex urge exerts such a
powerful infiuence over individual
and social activities its undue repres-
sion can conversely deprive us of
any full realization of our creative
potential. It is understandable, then,
that one of the most salient criticisms
against our society is that we, in fact,
are constrained by the many relig-
ious taboos on sex. These taboos
have passed on perfunctorily from
generation to generation in our cul-
tural heritage. They have persisted
chiefly because of the conservatism
of the church, which up until recent-
ly has been regarded as a final au-
thority. Now it is openly admitted
that, as William Graham Cole, pro-
fessor of religion at Williams College
stated, “there can be no quarrel with
the secular world at this point. It is
right and the church has_ been
wrong. Sex is natural and good....”

As the result of a more realistic
approach, theologians and church
leaders are waking up to the evils
of religiously inspired suppression
of sexual behavior. Professor
Roger Shinn of New York’s Union
Theological Seminary calls such
suppression a “Christian heresy.”
Protestant theologian Dr. Seward

New Philosophy Defies Religious Taboos

Hiltner remarked that since man
is “a whole or total being, sex is
good if it serves the fulfillment of
man as a total being.” Summing up
the contemporary switch in atti-
tudes on sex, Dr. George Morrison
Carstairs, professor of psychologi-
cal medicine at Edinburg Univer-
sity, speaks of a “new concept”
emerging, “of sexual relations as
a source of pleasure, but also as
a mutual encountering of person-
alities, in which each explores the
other and at the same time discov-
ers new depths in himself or her-
self.”

Hugh Hefner, editor of Playboy
and spokesman for the move for
liberalized sexual behavior, warns
that the new philosophy is directly
opposed to purely selfish sex, the
type of relationship that takes all
and gives nothing in return. What
it expresses, rather, is the need for
a greater “enlightened self-interest”
in society. “Too many people today
live their entire existence in a group,
of a group and for a group—never
attempting ‘to explore their own in-
dividuality, never discovering who
or what they are, or might be.
Searching out one’s own _ identity
and purpose, taking real pleasure in
being a person, establishing a basis
for true self-respect—these are the
essence of living.”

Such a philosophy, then, does not
advocate license or promiscuity, for
this would lead to the cheapening of
sex. Rather, it is a direct attack on
the shallowness toward this subject
that we have for so long been guilty
of in our blind acceptance of tra-
ditional religious taboos—it is thus
a stand for less superficiality and

The first Mock Convention, held in
the Spring of 1908, set the precedent
for the enthusiasm that was to play
such an important part in the future
Washington and Lee Mock Conven-
tions. The Lexington Gazette re-
ported in its May 6, 1908, edition:
“The young gentlemen entered into
the meeting with the zest of seasoned
politicians plus the enthusiasm of col-
legians.” This was quite an under-
statement; fist fights broke out
among the delegates on the conven-
tion-hall floor.

The first mock convention was
held as a result of the enthusiasm
aroused by William Jennings Bryan's
visit to Lexington in the spring of
1908. He was unanimously nomi-
nated. In the same year the Demo-
crats published the W&L Democrat.
In 1916 it was decided that the party
out of office would be the party of
the convention, and the Republican
convention of that year published
the Clarion.

One of the most colorful and en-
thusiastic conventions was the last
Democratic Convention held on May
2-3, 1960. Former President Harry
S. Truman delivered the Keynote
Address with Senator Henry A. Jack-
son of Washington state following
up in the evening.

1960 Parade

One of the most spectacular events
is the parade which precedes the main
events. In 1960 an estimated 20,000
spectators watched _ seventy-five

along with fifteen bands. The group
paraded along a route which wound
for over a mile through the streets
of Lexington.

Harry Truman rode in the last
Dusenberg convertible made, which
was contributed to the Mock Con-
vention parade by the Museum of
Motoring Memories at Natural
Bridge, Virginia. Miss Linda Lee
Meade, 1960 Miss America was on
hand for the ceremonies, riding with
the New Jersey delegation.

In the 1960 convention the Florida
delegation threw a thousand oranges
from their float. (Juice and seeds
splashed all over cars, spectators,
and floats.) A Rhode Island tele-
phone booth from their headquarters
display tumbled from a float in front
of the Varsity Billiard Academy,
injuring one of the genteel of Lex-
ington. The Virginia delegation float
of a replica of the Merrimac, com-
plete with guns, smokestack, etc.,
caught fire in the midst of the
parade.

Truman Gives Keynote Address

Following the parade, 1700 people
crowded into the gymnasium (thou-
sands more listened outside to rig-
ged-up speakers) to hear Truman’s
keynote address. In it he cut up the
entire Republican administration,
with special emphasis on its foreign
policy with his usual “vivacity.” At
the end of his speech he dedicated
the Memorial Plaque in memory of
the late Senator Alben W. Barkley
who died of a heart attack during
his address at the preceding conven-
tion,

That evening ‘the activities contin-
ued as Senator Henry A. (Scoop)
Jackson of Washington state deliver-
ed the message. Following that were
the nominations and roll call for the
President of the United States.

The following morning at 9:30 the
balloting for the Presidential nomi-
nations in the Democratic party be-
gan and continued until Senator
John Kennedy was nominated unan-
imously and confirmed. It had been
expected that there would be five
main candidates: Kennedy, Hubert
Humphrey, Stuart Symington, Lyn-
don Johnson, and Adlai Stevenson.
It was thought that Kennedy would
emerge as the Democratic nominee
for President within about three bal-
lots. Actually he was selected on the
sixth ballot over Lyndon Johnson.

Again the W&L Mock Convention
turned out to be a foresight and in-
dicator of National feeling: Kennedy
was nominated by the National Dem-
ocratic Convention during the sum-
mer. Only once has the W&L Mock
Convention Democratic Presidential
nominee differed from that of the
National Convention. This was in
1912 when the Mock Convention
nominated Judson Harmon. The Na-
tional Democratic Convention even-
tually nominated Woodrow Wilson,
who went on to be elected President.

With the 1964 Mock Convention
coming in May, there has already
been much discussion and specula-
tion on who will be the Republican
standard-bearer in the 1964 elee-
tions.

Former WGL Great Dies

Albert Felix Pierotti, ’23, died
yesterday in Revere, Massachusetts
at the age of 68. A funeral service
will be held here Monday.

Pierotti, in his years at Washing-
ton and Lee, and those after, com-
piled a record that will not soon be
forgotten.

As a professional football player,
he is tied with Jim Thorpe for the
greatest number of games played.
As a baseball player, he pitched
against Lou Gehrig in Gehrig’s pro-
fessional debut. In 1933 he wrestled
Jim Landos for the championship of
the world.

In his freshman year at W&L he
lettered in four sports, As a center
on the 1916 football team he was
chosen All-American. He captained
two sports. He was a member of
O.D.K. and the Monogram Club.

Until his retirement in 1962, Pier-
otti taught and coached baseball at

Pierotti
Chelsea High School in Massa-
chusetts. He was president of the
Chelsea teachers’ association and

secretary of the Everett, Massa-
chusetts Elk Lodge.

At Washington and Lee he played
in the days of H. K. “Cy” Young,
a great football player and outstand-
ing W&L basketball coach.

In 1916 he played center on the
football team that beat Randolph-
Macon 8-0 and Navy 10-0, tied Rut-
gers and Georgia Tech, and lost to
Army by only 13-7. The team, an-
chored by Pierotti at center, was
said to have the “strongest tackle to

tackle line in the country.” The
Boston Post named Pierotti an All-
American.

That year he started at guard on
the basketball team, which was un-
beaten in 13 games. He was a star
pitcher on the baseball team, and
ran on the General track team.

As a graduate, he was one of the
first men to embark on the “pro-
fessional football circuit.” He was
coach and captain of teams from
Cleveland and Milwaukee.

In twelve years of competition he
played in 267 games, a_ record
equalled only by Jim Thorpe. He re-
ceived a lifetime pass to all National
Football League games.

illness seems to be getting chronic as the Generals dropped

On September 20, 1920, he pitched
the Boston Braves to a 3-2 victory ,
over the New York Giants, a defeat
which cost the Giants the pennant. |
The following year he won 27 and!
lost 4 as a pitcher in the Eastern
League. He pitched the game in|
which Lou Gehrig made his first |
professional appearance.

He taught in Chelsea from 1927
until 1962. During that time he also |
coached football and baseball.

His interest in Washington and
Lee continued long after his gradua-
tion. As late as 1950 he wrote to
Young to tell him of a prospect who |
was“ a very good end and an ex-|
cellent basketball player and a fine
baseball player.”

Pierotti was unable to attend the
1958 Homecomings’ Game, to which

Bad Night

In the Tuesday game, the locals,
who have not won since they beat
Pennsylvania Military before Christ-
mas, had to hustle to keep the score
from reaching triple figures for the
second successive night.

On the other hand, Roanoke hit for
a nifty 48 per cent to win their
eighth in a row and 12th in 16. The
Generals are now 3-11.

Morris Creger did nothing to hurt
his state scoring lead as he netted
26 to lead Roanoke. Creger is now
averging 23.5. He got help from
Steve Baker and Paul Dotson, who
contributed 18 apiece.

Fred Mindell, playing one of the
finest games of his career, scored
18 and topped the Generals’ re-
bounding effort. Lou Paterno hit for
12 and Bob Spessard sank 10.

Rebounds Lacking

The Generals met their defeat un-
der the boards. The locals pulled
down one offensive rebound in the
first half. They hit for 38 per cent
from the floor.

Washington and Lee’s two big
centers—6-5 Bob Spessard and 6-4

bounds apiece.

All five of coach Joe Lyles’ starters
fouled out before the last ten min-

Dave Ogilvy was the high scorer

Every starter had accumulated at
least three personals by half-time,
when G.M.A. led 51-36.

Beta and PiKA clinched playoff berths in basketball last

night with both teams defeating opponents played earlier this
season. The reason for the replays—protests by SPE and Kap-

pa Sig.

Beta, taking advantage of their rebound advantage, came

back from a 14-9 halftime deficit to down SPE 31-26. PikKA

had ‘to overcome Randy Poore’s 16*

point output in order to beat Kappa
Sig, 37-28. The big difference—re-
bounding again as PiK( controlled

contest.

The championship looks like this:

Beta, PiKA, Sigma Nu, and SAE all
competing for the crown won last
year by SAE. Sigma Nu and SAE
shape up as favorites for the play-
offs, which begin Monday.
SAE sported the best offense in the
season just ended, averaging 50 a
game, while Sigma Nu featured the
stingest defense, giving up little
more than 20 per game. PiKA pins
its hopes for an upset victory on
Bob Stauffer, while Beta hopes for
the championship will depend pretty
much on their demonstrated ability
to control the boards.

Swimmers Lose;

Face Toughies

Two pool records were broken as
W&L swimmers were dealt a stern
56-39 defeat by American Univer-
sity in the team’s last home meet.

Old Dominion and powerful Mary-
land face the team this weekend.
The Generals swam this afternoon in
Norfolk and meet Maryland away
tomorrow.

The jayvee swimmers lost yester-
day to Massanutten, 54-41.

In the Tuesday meet, freshman
Bill Wildrick set a new pool record
in the butterfly, swimming 200 yards
in 2:05.1. A.U.’s Lavenstein cut 4
of a second from the 500 yard free-
style event.

Maryland is one of ‘the nation’s
best ten swimming teams, and should
have little trouble from the Gen-
erals. They have beaten such teams
as Navy and their swimmers hold
four W&L pool records.

Rau Rebellard and Don Dumphy
lead the team. Rebellard holds the
200 yard freestyle record in Dore-
mus, Dumphy the individual medley
mark,

Old Dominion, although they lost
to American by only three points,
did not face A.U.’s best. The Norfolk
team has been hampered by losses
through transfer and marriage.

The Generals opened the Amer-
ican meet with a medley relay vic-
tory. The medley team, which Coach
Norris Eastman calls his “best ever,”

In This Saturday’s Contests

By GUY UNANGST

The Franklin and Marshall wrest-
ling team, Georgetown rifle squad,
and Virginia college track teams will
converge in Lexington tomorrow.

The VMI Fieldhouse will be the
scene of the 1964 Virginia State
Indoor Track Meet, featuring all the
Big Five and Little Eight.

In wrestling, F&M will meet the
Generals in Doremus at 7:30 p.m.,
while the rifle team faces George-
town at the VMI range at 2:30 p.m.

Virginia, VMI, William and Mary
and VPI will all be represented in
the State Meet. According to W&L
coach Norm Lord, the competition
looks plenty stiff.

He said the best chance for a first
would be in the high jump with
Robin Kell, who placed third in the
VMI Relays, held earlier this month.
Kell’s best indoor jump is 6-1.

Other events in which the var-
sity might place high, he said,
were the 500 yard run, with Skipp
Essex; the two mile run, with
Ralph O'Connor; and the mile re-
lay.

 

Brad Shinkle has a chance in the
freshman two mile run, his best
time being about 10:55. In the fresh-
man pole vault event, Lord cited
Johnny Graham, who may not enter
because of a pulled muscle. Graham
does about 12 feet.

The afternoon events begin at 2
p.m., and include mostly prelimi-
naries and freshman events. The
evening session starts at 6:30, clos-
ing with the mile relay at 9:15.

The Generals have but one more
event scheduled, a dual meet against
Bridgewater, February 26.

Franklin and Marshall, one of the
two teams to beat the W&L wrest-
lers last year, entered Saturday’s
meet with a 2-5 overall record.

F&M plays a_ stiffer sched-
ule than the Generals. Their two vic-
tories have come in matches against
Brown and Bucknell.

Paul Martin will wrestle 157 for
F&M. He defeated Tom Stover last
year in the 137 pound class. Steve
Dubner, the only other returnee, will
wrestle 177. Pete Winfield pinned

Braithwaite Replies To Rights Conference Evaluation

Editor
Friday Ring-tum Phi
Sir:

I wish to comment briefly on the
story by Tracy Harrington in last
Tuesday’s edition on the Bryn Mawr
Civil Rights Conference. There were
errors in it which should be correct-
ed.

First, the editor’s note preceding
the story said three students and a
professor attended. (Besides Har-
rington, there were Bob Potts, Lamar
Lamb, and Dr. Hodges.) The politi-
cal colors of these four are well-
known here.

I also attended the conference, and
as a conservative resent being omit-
ted from the note because of the
implication (also often manifest in
the public press, I might add) that
these “liberals” were the only ones
here interested enough to go.

Second, tthe exchange between Mr.

 

Kilpatrick and Mr. Farmer was not
a debate. Had it been, Mr. Kilpat-
rick clearly would have won. It was |
rather a statement of opposed posi-'

tions and an exchange of views on
specific issues.

Third, it is a gross distortion of
the truth that Kilpatrick “lost his
temper a number of times and fared
rather badly in argument with more
articulate Farmer.” Mr. Kilpatrick
argued with zeal and vigor, was
forceful, yes, admittedly even rude
on occasion, but he did NOT lose
his “temper a number of times.” As
for his faring “rather badly,” Mr.
Harrington obviously never has at-
tended a real debate, else he would
be able to distinguish emotional
rhetoric and ad hominem arguments
(Farmer) from clear, cogent reason-
ing (Kilpatrick), One may have dis-
agreed with Mr. Kilpatrick’s argu-
ment, and Harrington correctly
points out that almost all the dele-
gates did, but any judge of de-
bate would undisputably have found
the Richmond editor a winner.

Kinsey reports conclusively show
that sexual morality is undergoing
revolutionary changes and that we
are no longer accepting many of
these taboos (the prohibitions against

In the face of such change, liberal

sex out in the open, to discuss it
freely without embarrassment or re-
straint, and if the result of honest
searching is a contradiction to tra-
ditional mores, not to be afraid to

ommittee On Fraternities W1
Newly - Proposed IFC Constitution T

By ART BROADUS
President, Interfraternity Council

In the next few weeks, the proposed Constitution will come
to the floor of the IFC. We feel an obligation to present, in
explicit form, some of the thoughts which prompted the new
measures, so that the school community might understand.

In the following article, we shall discuss why we feel that
change is necessary, and then we will relate several of the spe-
cific proposals.

The rather dynamic clashes between varying fraternity
systems and school administration across the nation in the last
decade are indicative of a mood not altogether lacking at
Washington and Lee. The mood also permeates the town of
Lexington. The public image of fraternities has declined stead-
ily over the years. The blame for this must and should lie with
the fraternities.

Public Image of Fraternities
An alarming number of people view the fraternity simply

Review

his Friday

as a volcanic structure which erupts blatantly on the weekend
and grumbles noisily throughout the remainder of the week.
It is an easy matter to say that this opinion is both narrow and
shallow as it obviously is. But the fraternities have made little
effort to erect any other public image of themselves, having
adopted, for the most part, a withdrawn and reactionary policy.

The IFC Charity Fund of this year is painful evidence of
the policy in operation. It seems that a significant number of
fraternity members feel that the townspeople should be con-
tent with the financial benefits which they reap from the fra-
ternities and should keep their noses to themselves, their lips
set in a mercenary smile. This opinion is no more creditable
than the one above which we termed narrow and shallow.

Academic and Social Issues

The major issues contested between the Washington and
Lee faculty and the fraternities are academic and social. Both
problems are dynamic and multi-faceted and defy concise des-
cription. It is difficult to argue the academic question in either

direction, for studies appear to be predominantly an individual
matter. The immature student will find simple means of dis-
traction under any conditions.

The same argument may be maintained as regards social
behavior, but here it is somewhat less defensible. Fraternity
parties are almost invariably linked with the use of differing
quantities of alcohol, and here lies the real problem. The dif-
ference between right and wrong becomes hazier in arithmetic

progress from drink to drink, both finally joining hands in
stumbling oblivion.
Duty of Legitimate

It is superfluous to add that the problems noted in the
preceding paragraphs are harly restricted to fraternities. But
we must remember that the fraternities are in the spotlight.
A legitimate Interfraternity Council should recognize all of
these trouble areas and should attempt to legislate them to
the best of its ability. This is not so easily done.

Origins G Failure Of Act
Discussed By Dr. Behrman

By HOWARD EPSTEIN
Associate Editor
Speaking last night to a filled Lee Chapel, Dr. Jack N.
Behrman, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Domestic and
International Affairs, described the Trade Expansion Act of

 

1962 from its origin to its present affects and its future im-
*

plications.

Beginning his lecture, he pointed
out the causes and the needs for the
act, which he broke into four dis-
tinct groupings: First, the need for
a continuation of the Reciprocal
Trade Agreement that recently ex-
pired. Dr. Behrman mentioned that
although trade would continue after
the expiration of the agreement, no
expansion or revision was possible.

Second, the need for trade ex-
pansion with the European Common
Market. Third, expansion with the
European Free Trade Association
(EFTA). And fourth, the need for
greater trade with less developed
nations.

Policy Discussions

With these purposes in mind, poli-
cy discussions with the departments
of Labor, Agriculture, Commerce,
and State were started in the middle
of 1961 and rushed into form. The
proposed bill that emerged called
for radical changes in U.S. trade
policy.

The first provision called for the
delegation of authority to the Presi-
dent to be able to cut tariffs by
50 per cent, including across-the-
board slashes. Added to this was
the authority to cut tariffs to the
Common Market to zero on those
items in which either US. or the

Common Market dominated the
world market.
The bill further demanded the

abolition of the Nuisance Tariffs (less
than 5 per cent) and the special at-
tention to tropical products coming
from Latin countries. A section was
provided for agricultural agreements
and the nullification of the Peril-

Peace Corps Placement Exams

Given To Minks And Cadets

By STIRLING LATHROP

On February 14 placement exams
were administered to Peace Corps |
applicants at VMI, with four Wash- |
ington and Lee students and three
cadets participating. Performance on
the tests, personal information, and
consulted references are the factors
considered in making the final de-
cisions concerning applicants, and
where they would be best suited for
a Peace Corps’ project.

The tests themselves are non-
competitive, and are not marked

for passing or failing grades, but
assist mainly in helping the Peace
Corps assign applicants to an area
of Peace Corps work. In general

the tests are administered at the

Post Office from every six weeks

ly be given again in May.

Unsung, Un

Perform Backstage Roles

By KEN McGRAW

Behind the scenes in every sense
of the phrase are the backstage
workers at the Troubadour Theater.
They rank with the nightwatchman
and the postman in respect to the
unsung, unnoticed work they per-
form. The necessity of their work is
apparent but often is taken for
granted.

For the upcoming play, Dr. Faust-
us, there will be some thirty odd
students playing key roles in the
production who will never go on
stage. These are the technicians, car-
penters, makeup artists, prop men,
and members of the business staff.

Dr. Cecil Jones, Director of the
Troub Theater, cited all these stu-
dents for the importance of their
work but particularly those working
as supervisors and crew heads.

The Stage Manager for Dr.
Faustus is Don Lineback. His job
is to coordinate and supervice the
work of all the backstage crews. The
seasonal stage manager for the
Troubs is Dan Friedman who, for
this production, has been put in
charge of all the technical work.
Friedman works along with Kim

supervisor of the set crews, respon-
sible for all the permanent construc-
tion. For Faustus this consists in a
reproduction of the Elizabethan
stage.

The lighting for Faustus is ex-
tremely important to the effect of the
play and comes under the responsi-
bility of Wink McKinnon, master
electrician. Lighting changes in some
places constitute scene changes and
are also important in creating the
mood. The final student supervisor
for the upeoming production is Kirk
Griffin who is production supervi-
sor. He will be in charge during the
performances.

The movable props are the re-
sponsibility of property master Cary
Williams. Bruce Whelihan, sound

master carpenter, as joint |

seen Heroes

, engineer, is in charge of all the sound
effects and music. Jerry Koffman is
the make-up artist and Drew Baur
is in charge of the box office. These
last four are the crew heads, and
each has a number of students work-
ing with them.

Debaters Tally |
Winning Record
At Tournament

By STIRLING LATHROP

Representing the University for
the first time at the Dartmouth In-
vitational Debate Tournament this
past weekend, a Washington and Lee
debate team composed of two soph-
omores, Ed Fitzgerald and John Mc-
Murray defeated Cornell, Norwich,
Penn. State, St. John’s and South-
western Missouri, while losing to
Wayne State, Northwestern § and
Fordham.

The Dartmouth Tournament is al-
ways one of the two or three finest
in the nation, and the results posted
by the W&L team here were the
best ever recorded by a W&L team
in the northeast during the last 10
years.

Dual Meet Coming Up

This coming Wednesday, February
19, a Washington and Lee debate
team will participate in a dual meet
with Roanoke and VPI at VPI in
Blacksburg. Debate coach, Dr. Chaf-
fin, will send Allen Cohen, Claude
Rogers, and Billy Want, and is as
yet undecided about the fourth.

Again, on Saturday, two teams
will represent W&L at the second
Richmond Invitational Tournament.
A novice and varsity team will de-
bate both sides of this year’s re-
solve in six rounds of debate. Rick
Kneipper and Jack Eure will com-
prise the varsity squad with Bill
Grant and Claude Rogers forming
the novice team.

Norton and Frazier Win

Two weeks ago, on February 7th
and 8th, a W&L team of Sam Frazier
and Ed Norton posted a 4-2 record
at the King’s Tournament, sponsored
by King College in Wilkes-Barre,
Penn. With Norton, a senior, coming
out of retirement, the pair lost their
first two contests, then came back to
capture the last four. Debating for
the first time together, they repre-
sented W&L against thirty-one
teams from thirty colleges.

Notice

The Tuesday Edition of the Ring-
tum Phi will hold a staff meeting in
Room 23 of the Student Union on
Friday at 5 p.m.

 

ANECDOTE OF THE WEEK

Greeting on former president
Eisenhower’s door mat: “Ah, ah,
er, ah, ahh—Welcome.”

Kence.

CORE director James Farmer par-
ticipated with James Kilpatrick, edi-
tor of the Richmond News-Leader
and author of The Case for Segre-
gation in the South in a panel dis-
cussion.

While each man was ostensibly
to present his own position, the
“panel discussion” quickly became a
debate over the most hotly discussed
points in the civil rights movement:
Negro inferiority and property rights.

Kilpatrick contended that Ne-
groes are, in fact, inherently in-
ferior as a race to whites. He
pointed to what he called “flimsy”
contributions of Negroes through-
out history in areas of ethics, cul-
ture, and politics—and further in-
dicated that anthropoligical evi-
dence proving Negro inferiority
“has been shamefully suppressed.”

Moving to the area of legal ac-
tion, Kilpatrick said he felt laws
enforcing segregation or integration
wrong; he asserted his belief in
limited government, and said that
this principle was seriously threaten-
ed by federal intervention in current
civil rights controversy.

The first human right, Kilpatrick
insisted, “is the right of property;
unless property rights are secure,
Americans’ freedom is not secure.”
Citing both the fourth and four-
teenth Constitutional Amendments
as guarantees of property rights,
Kilpatrick said that while Negroes
want the right to buy, “we want the
right not to sell.”

Farmer took issue, as was to be
expected, with Kilpatrick’s assertion
of Negro inferiority.

He first cited several sources
which, he said, established the fact
that Negroes had produced highly
complex civilizations—lost cities
in Africa, He further quoted the
American Society of Anthropology
in its statement that “There are
no scientific grounds for assuming
either inferiority or superiority of
one race over another.”

After having made his case against
racial inequality, Farmer declared
the whole question irrelevant. “All
science could establish would be an
average man,” he said. “The Amer-
ican Dream is based on individual
rights, not the idea of an average
man,”

“Suppose science could establish
‘Negro’ inferiority— would I then be
disallowed to pursue my own indi-
vidual potentialities?”

Farmer attempted to answer Kil-
patrick’s limited government argu-
ment by saying that “laws are im-
portant, not to change men’s views,
but to regulate their actions so as
not ‘to interfere with other men.”

As for property rights, Farmer
held that when an individual runs

A Journalistic Milestone

We heartily applaud the latest example of the Friday
Edition’s perceptive and well-expressed editorial policy.
While we cannot hope to match its facility of expression or
its depth of thought, we at least can concur with what
they say. Surely no one can disagree with us in our praise
for that hallmark of editorial comment, ‘Filet Mignon In
The Commons?”

But...

You First! No, You First!

With a singular and remarkable consistency, the Fri-
day Edition has once again missed the point in an issue
of major importance. Their coup de grace of last week,
“An Unjust Attack,” plumbed new depths of irrelevance.
It saddens us to note that in their zeal to “correct some
misgivings” in our paper, the Friday editors demonstrated
their inability to understand the crux of the W&L inte-
gration problem.

As usual, the Friday editor was claiming his editorial
as the exponent of the real truth. His revelation was that
no Negro has ever submitted a completed application to
W&L. In last Tuesday’s paper, this truth can be found
on page one, about two inches from the bottom in column
three.

All White Student Body ‘No Coincidence’

“An Unjust Attack” then suggests that in theory there
is no evidence that W&L is segregated. We suggest that
the Friday editor glance around for a day or two at his
fellow students. We submit that it is no mere coincidence,
theory or no theory, that they are all white.

We admit that there has been no real test, in the form
of an application from a Negro, to show conclusively
what W&L’s policy might be. We stated last Tuesday
that the Admissions Committee “seemingly must skip
over” Negro applications. The Friday editor quoted that
same statement, leaving out the first word. We did not
mean to sound as positive as the Friday editor thought;
rather, we wanted to convey the ambiguity of the entire
situation.

No Movement Intended—Just An Opinion

No one knows what the University would do—that is
true—but the general impression is that the Trustees have
a negative opinion vis-a-vis integrating W&L. We are not
attempting to start a movement to force the Trustees to
an immediate decision; we merely think it is time that some
students’ opinions started going down on record.

Our position is that W&L should not expect the
Negro to go all the way in the solving of our problem,
and submit an application to an all-white University which
has remained silent on the integration issue. A student
from Hampton Institute put it this way: if a student wants
to join a fraternity, but that fraternity has shown no signs
of interest in him, the student does not write a letter to
the fraternity asking to be considered for membership.
The first move is up to the fraternity.

Position Should Be Declared

This analogy can be applied in part to W&L. Our part
of the bargain should be to declare, simply, that we will
not refuse a qualified applicant because of his race. Is that
too much to ask, especially in terms of what so many other
public and private southern institutions have done al-
ready?

On one side, there ar« the Trustees who choose to al-
low W&L’s position to remain ambiguous. On the other
side are Negro high school graduates, who seem hesitant
to apply to a college in W&L’s category: all white and
undeclared on the race issue. W&L has lost the chance to
be a good leader; why not be a good follower? Or do we
wait until some organization tries to break the stalemate
by pushing a Negro through the barrier of our indecision,
with all the unpleasantness which would accompany such
an attempt?

Negro Social Situation Poses No Problem

Although the Friday editor’s questions about Negroes
wanting to come here, and about their probable social
status once here, are absolutely irrelevant to the issue at
hand, we want to say this: we have talked to Negroes
who would apply to W&L were the school officially open-
ed to them; we are sure they would have no more prob-
lems with dating than any other W&L man has; and, we
have enough confidence in the W&L student body to say
that they would have as many close friends, if not more,
as any other student here.

 

We Were Wondering .. .
Why the Executive Committee, after exterminat-
ing Addison Brokenrecord (as the Friday Edition
claims) overlooked Drew Baur in the process.

 

 

 

   

I would like to devote this
column to a review of five books,
all of them available in paperback,
which I have read and enjoyed
recently and which I’d like to pass
on to you.

The first book is entitled Excel-
lence: Can we be equal and excel-
lent too? Written by John W. Gard-
ner, President of the Carnegie Foun-
dation for the Advancement of
teaching, the book explores the con-
ditions under which excellence is
possible in American society today.
The concept of equality is also ex-
amined as the author seeks “the
kinds of equality that can and must
be honored, and the kinds that can-
not be forced.”

What difficulties does a democracy
encounter in pursuing excellence?
Is there a way out of these difficul-
ties? How equal do we really want
to be? It would seem that in the
light of the debates now going
on over the national purposes, civil
rights, and social welfare, a book
which deals with these crucial ques-
tions ought to be at the top of every-
one’s reading list.

Five Controversial Books
Suggested for Extra Reading

Reviewed by Rod Cockshutt

For the New Intellectual

The second book I’d like to recom-
mend is Ayn Rand’s For the New
Intellectual. Here, in one book, are
the fundamentals of her interesting
philosophy, “objectivism.” The theor-
ies are laid down in a series of orig-
inal essays, as well as selected ex-
cerpts from her already published
fictional works. And while many
will find Miss Rand’s ethical and
“humanitarian” theories personally

repugnant, we cannot deny that
what she says is both fascinating and
thought-provoking.

Dostoevsky

Next is Russian philosopher and
theologian Nicholas Berdyaev’s com-
pelling study, Dostoevsky. The book
attempts to look into the great Rus-
sian author’s spiritual side. As Berd
yaev himself says: “I want to ex-
plore in depth the way in which he
apprehended the universe and intui-
tively to reconstruct out of these
elements his whole world vision.”
This is difficult reading but by no
means unintelligible, and definitely
worth the effort.

Fourth is Michael Harrington’s dis-

turbing essay on poverty in the
United States today, The Other
America, The author’s claim is that
there are close to fifty million Amer-
icans living today without adequate
food, housing, education and medi-
cal care. Harrington fears that the
image of America given us by Madi-
son Avenue and other believers in
the “affluent society” is dulling our
conscience and making us unaware
of the situation that a sizeable por-
tion of our population must live in.

Finally, I'd like to recommend
The Predicament of the Democratic
Man by Dr. Edmond Cahn, Profes-
sor of Law at New York University.
The book examines the whole idea of
civic responsibility, both collective
and individual, in a democracy, and
helps to define what levels of partic-
ipation in government the democratic
man can and should attain.

All five of these books are contro-
versial in one way or another, All
are full of ideas which we are free
to accept or reject. But I believe
that all of them are timely and speak
boldly to each of us, no matter what
our special interest or areas of
specialization.

Jules and Jim’...Latest Truffaut Hit

By TOM PACE
“Jules and Jim’—a film by
Francois Truffaut. With Jean

Moreau, Oskar Werner, and Henri
Serre. Written by Truffaut, with
music by George Delerue. “Jules
and Jim” opens at the Lyric Wed-
nesday.

“The Prize’—a film starring Paul
Newman. With Elke Sommer, Diane
Baker, and Edward G. Robinson.
Directed by Mark Robson. Written
by Ernest Lehman, based on a
novel by Irving Wallace. “The Prize”
begins Sunday at the State.

“Jules and Jim” is Francios Tru-
ffaut’s finest film to dite Truffaut
and Alain Resnais (“Last Year at
Marienbad”) are the two most
exciting, and probably the two best
foreign directors working at pres-
ent. It follows then, that “Jules
and Jim” is one of the great films
of the last few years.

The Story—Jules, a German, goes
to Paris, where he meets Jim with
whom he becomes fast friends. They
are very happy in their relationship.
Jules and Jim meet Catherine. She
only to be parted by World War I.
The war also splits up the two men.
During the war, Catherine has a
child.

The War ends and the two men
begin to correspond again. Jim comes
to visit Jules and his wife. He
notices a strain between the two.

Seeing that Catherine is about to
abandon Jules, Jim, with Jules’
urging, steps in and begins an af-
fair with her. As a result the house
becomes serene, content, and happy
once more. (For though Catherine
shares a bed with Jim, Jules is
made happy merely by her pres-
ence.)

Catherine grows tired of Jim
and rejects him. Later she asks
him back, but he refuses. Several
months after this Jules and Cath-
erine meet Jim, accidentally, at a
movie house. The three go off for
an afternoon of conversation and
and lemonade. Catherine asks Jim
to go for a ride with her in the
car. She drives them off a bridge
which had been bombed in the
war, and they are drowned. Jules
then goes threugh the ordeal of
their cremation and interment; the
last seene shows him walking
down the hill away from the cem-
etery.

Truffaut is dealing with many
things. As the title suggests, he is
dealing with the value of a full and
real friendship between two men.
Nonetheless, he seems more interest-
ed in the character of Catherine, and
the way in which she embodies the
characteristics of his concept of love.
He shows so honestly, through her,
the essence of love; it is gay and
pleasant, harmful and frightening,
inconsistent, conconstant, and im-

pure. But it is the most, the best
we have.

His style and treatment coincide
with his theme. “Jules and Jim” has
a continuity of real motion, motion
provided by expert use of the cam-
era. The film flows, halts, walks,
and runs. It is this motion that dis-
tinguishes Truffaut from other di-
rectors. It is this which makes his

films delightful and musical.

One particular scene, the “village
idiot” scene, exemplifies his genius
best. It involves revolving the
camera around one person, and
then another in rapid fire motion;
then stepping back quickly to view
the whole action, and then into the
fray again, moving and revolving
from person to person. His camera
is constantly moving—in an air-
plane, in his unsteady hand, in a
circular motion, in brilliant jarring
closeups, and in a slow, smooth
traversing movement. Truffaut is
also the master of the quick cut,
as evidenced in the presentation
of titles, or when Jean Moreau
first appears,

This is not to suggest his film is
devoid of faults. There are several
scenes which do not come off quite
right. There are even some which are
dull. Also I don’t believe that Tru-
ffaut delivers the impact that he
wants; for I feel too little sympathy
for his characters. (A fault which

Goldwater’s Position on ICBM’s, Cuba,
Atlantic Alliance Makes Voters Think

Editor’s Note: “Political Horiz-
ons” is an open column, and we
welcome any qualified student or
faculty member to present views
which differ from those expressed
by Mr. Durrette. If interested,
contact Roger Paine, HO 3-4015,
by Thursday of the week before
the paper is published.

By WYATT B. DURRETTE, JR.

Att the time he announced his can-
didaey, Barry Goldwater clearly set
— tne tone of his

~ campaign by tell-
' ing the American
people he intend-
ed to offer us “a
choice, not an
echo.” He has.
_ Consequently, the
. smug and confi-
dent defenders of
the status quo, the
practioners of that
hallowed _ ortho-
doxy which has
for 30 years remained beyond re-
proach, have stepped up to the firing
line. Target? Goldwater.

In the areas of defense and foreign
policy the Senator is particularly
controversial. Since beginning his
campaign he has told us that: (1)
our ICBM’s are not dependable; (2)
he favored granting authority to the
Supreme Commander of NATO to

 

Durrette

use tactical nuclear weapons in the
event of hostilities in Burope; (3)
he would have ordered U.S. Marines
to cut back on our water outside of
“Gitmo”; (4) he would use Amer-
ican warships to prevent trade with
communist Cuba by friend or foe.

Reaction to Goldwater

Immediately the cries reverber-
ated: “unreasonable”; “relaxation of
tensions”; “unrealistic”; “invitation
to annihilation”; “endangering sensi-
tive negotiations”; ete.; ad infinitum,
ad nauseam. The voices of paralysis,
of negativism, of compromise, nego-
tiate, and retreat that have dominat-
ed U.S. policy since World War II
have risen from the wastelands to
engage the harbinger from Arizona.

Unrealistic? In 1961 before a Sen-
ate subcommittee Secretary MeNa-
mara testified regarding his doubts
as to the hardness of our missle sites.
Goldwater does this and he’s “irre-
sponsible.” Under ideal conditions
30 per cent of our ICBM’s have failed
to leave the launching pad. We do
not know what effect a high yield
atmospheric nuclear explosion may
have on the electronic guidance sys-
tem of our missles.

These doubts are shared by mem-
bers of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, par-
ticular Gen. Curtis LeMay, as well
as Dr. Teller and Gen. Powers.

Unrealistic? On the day the Sena-

tor made the statement a nuclear
submarine test fired 3 Polaris mis-
sles—2 failed to get out of the water!
The answers to the doubts Barry
Goldwater has raised lie sealed in-
definitely beneath the strictures of
the Treaty of Moscow.

Add to this the fact that our pres-
ent defense policy, as I understand
it, anticipates no future develop-
ments in manned bombers which
means as the Senator once said that
“all our eggs are in the missle bas-
ket.” Since to a man military wit-
nesses testified that the Test Ban
Treaty was militarily disadvantag-
eous to the U.S., what is unrealistic
about suggesting that we should test
the strength of the “weave” of the
“basket?”

Trouble in Atlantic Alliance

Unreasonable? Without a doubt
the Atlantic Alliance is in trouble.
Lord Hume’s “bussing” with Castro,
DeGaulle’s recognition of Mao’s Red
Terror and failure to sign the Mos-
cow Treaty, the Skybolt cancellation,
the Suez incident, out attitude over
Angola and Mozabique have, among
other things, contributed towards a
weaking of the ties among the 15
member NATO alliance.

Goldwater wrote in an article for
Life magazine:

Percy Novel
[ nvestigates

Deep Reality

By BERT PHILLIPS
Walker Percy: The Moviegoer—
(Popular Library, $1.50)
the specific character of despair is
precisely this:
it is unaware of being despair
—Soren Kierkegaard,
The Sickness Unto Death

“For years I have had no friends.
I spend my entire time working,
making money,
going to the mov-
ies and_ seeking
company of wo-
men... .” So be-
gins the story of
Binx Bolling, cen-
tral character in

 

Walter Percy’s
first novel, The
Moviegoer,.

Binx is just

short of 30, of good
family, a veteran
of the Korean War and a securities
salesman with an ability for calling
the turns in his trade. His surface
trouble is that life seems like a
chronic sickness; his fear is of de-
feat by “everydayness.” Life around
him seems fat, genial, kindly—and
stupid.

“Men are dead, dead, dead; and
the malaise has settled like a fall-
out and what people really fear
is not that the bomb will fall but
that the bomb will not fall....”
Comfortable, well heeled Binx
habitually sleeps with his secre-
taries and finds that the movies
are a deeper reality than the life
around him.

But sex and movies are not
enough, and always vaguely he is
engaged in a search for a deeper
reality, some card of identity that
will get him through better doors
than the ones his pocketful of credit
cards enable him to pass through.

A reviewer for Time remarked:
“Author Percy appears, his first time
out, clothed in originality, intelli-
gence and a fierce regard for Man’s
fate. In The Moviegoer, he writes
about New Orleans and the sur-
rounding countryside as though he
had created it, but that is almost the
least of his virtues. The main fact
is that his theme—the despair that
attacks the numberless people in
their inmost minds—is handled with
just the right degree of seriousness
and humor, of rancor and indiffer-
ence... Percy, a natural writer, has
a rare talent for making his people,
Negro, Jew, or Southern aristocrat,
look and sound as though they were
being seen and heard for the first
time by anyone,”

The Moviegoer was awarded the
following citation for being named
winner of the 1962 National Book
Award for Fiction: The Moviegoer,
in intimation rather than a statement
of morality and the inevitable of
that condition, is a truthful novel
with shocks of recognition and
spasms of nostalgia for every—or
nearly every—American. Mr. Percy,
with compassion and without senti-
mentality or the mannerisms of the
clinic, examines the delusions and
hallucinations and the daydreams
and the dreams that afflict those who
abstain from the customary ways of
making do,”

Mermen Down Old Dominion, Lose To Md.
Wrestlers Overwhelmed By E &M 19-9

Wolfe, Relay Team Set New’
Records At Old Dominion

By SKIP CHASE
Tuesday Sports Writer

The Generals of Norris Eastman kept their seasonal rec-

ord above .500 by beating Old

ing to the powerful Terps of Maryland. The weekend trip left

the swim team, 5-4, with only strong East Carolina College
*left on the slate.

in last week’s two games,

Cagers Beaten
Up Loss Skein

By TOM CARPENTER

The Washington and Lee basket-
ball team had another unsuccessful
road trip over the weekend, despite
two players setting career scoring
highs. Howard Martin scored 20
points against Baltimore University,
but the Generals succumbed, 97-81,
Friday night. In Saturday’s game
Fred Mindel tallied 21 points, but
Lebanon Valley came out on top, 96-
75.

Baltimore used its height advant-
age as best as possible and were
still fortunate to come out ahead.
The Marylanders got off 94 shots,
the most taken against the Generals
this season. Using their two six foot-
five inch inside men, the winners
completely controlled the back-
boards, which allowed them to take
all those shots. The Generals shot
84 per cent but were able to get off
only 64 shots.

Paterno Scores 27

Lou Paterno was high scorer for
W&L with 27 points. Martin, be-
sides scoring 20 points, was the
only man for the losers who was able
to contest the bigger host team play-
on the boards.

Lebanon Valley had little trouble
in coasting to victory. Paterno had
16 points and Martin had 12. Mindel
was high with his personal record
breaking performance. The Dutch-
men’s victory dropped the Generals’
record to three wins and 12 losses.

RPI brings the Generals’ regular
season to a close here tonight at
8. The Richmonders won an earlier
contest between the two clubs. To-
night also marks the end of Coach
Bob McHenry’s tenure at Washing-
ton and Lee on his home court,
where he starred in many a game
during his years here as an under-
graduate.

At Old Dominion, W&L dominated
the meet and set pool records in
both the 500-yard freestyle (by John
Wolfe in 5:59.8) and the 400-yard
freestyle relay team of Bart Taylor,
Skip Chase, Walt McManus and Bill
Wildrick. Firsts were also taken
in the medley relay, 50-yard free-
style, diving by David Geer, individ-
ual medley by George Bokinsky, 200-
yard backstroke by Bill Broaddus,
and in the 20-yard butterfly and
200-yard breaststroke by co-captains
McManus and Jim Wallenstein.

Maryland Meet

At College Park the following af-
ternoon, the Generals seemed rattled
by the large crowd which saw the
home Terrapins take nine of eleven
firsts and shatter the pool record of
Navy for the 400-yard freestyle
relay in 3:19.6. Signs of travel fatigue
seemed evident in the times made by
the Generals which did not match
those of the day before. Maryland
swept all firsts and seconds through
the diving, but then let up by swim-
ming some of their entries unoffi-
| cially. Under these conditions, Wolfe
and Wallenstein took firsts in the
500-yard freestyle and 200-yard
breaststroke respectively.

Seconds were taken by Steve
Lunde in the 200-yard backstroke,
Wildrick in the 200-yard butterfly
and by Taylor in the 100-yard free-
style. The final score was 67-28 as
the University of Maryland stretched
its undefeated record to 11-0.

Kell took first in the triple jump,
and a second in the high jump for

Goldwater’s Thrust ‘Unavoidable’

(Continued from page 2)

the failure of the Democratic
administration since 1960 to provide
for the full participation of our al-
lies in the planning and deployment
of the most modern weapons sys-
tems, including appropriate nuclear
weapons.
The Democrats’ Isolationism

In this, the Democratic administra-
tion has been pursuing the most po-
tentionally disastrous course of iso-

Suggesting that tactical nuclear
weapons be made available to NATO,
Goldwater further said that, “so
long as Europeans feel that the U.S.
can veto the defense of their homes
by most modern weapons, they will
have reason to view the NATO al-
liance half in hope and half in fear.”

tactics of the name-caller is not
only intellectually dishonest, but a
fraud on the American people as
well.

A cancerous growth on a tiny
island in the Carribean is threaten-
ing daily to stretch its tenacles fur-
ther into Latin America while the
colossus of the North bumbles, fum-
bles, and fawns before the fuzzy-
faced Castro. We have no Cuban pol-
icy—at least no visible one. And our
Latin American policy makers are
mesmerized by their own grand-
iloquence while their Alliance for
Progress with all its nobility of pur-
pose offers too little, too late to a
fomenting continent.

Perceiving what he considers to
be a dire threat to this hemisphere,
as well as a terrific detriment to
our prestige that could be damag-
ing throughout the world, Senator
Goldwater has made some progres-
sive, affirmative suggestions that de-
serve our consideration.

Risk in Inaction

Of course, there is risk in action,

but so is there in inaction as to
which World War II is a bitter me-
morial. The negative policy of inac-
tion and compromise which we have
pursued with rare exceptions since
World War II has throughout history
resulted in either war or surrender.
In an effort to avoid this final choice
Barry Goldwater is challenging us
to think, to question, and to ponder
the policy and thus the future of the
West.
As is historically true with any
great or controversial figure many
sincerely disagree with him; many
abhor him; many do not understand
him; and many eagerly support him.
Honest men in all categories should
face the issues and ponder the
alternatives, not merely turn aside
with a shrug and a phrase to other
things.

Chris Kell were also members of the
Generals’ scoring relay team. Coach
Lord expressed satisfaction in the
track team’s showing since the Gen-
erals were competing against such
track powers as VMI, Virginia VPI
and William and Mary.

In the freshman competition, the
Baby Generals gained five points in
the meet for an overall team stand-
ing of ninth out of the thirteen other
freshman squads. John Graham led
the freshmen with a third place in
the pole vaulting event, while W&L’s
other two points came as Brian
Kendrich, Barry Vaught, Bob Big-
ham and Don Rogers combined to
bring Washington and Lee a fourth
place in the mile relay.

IFC Constitution Discussed

(Continued from page 1)

Fraternity allegiance makes the average house officer
slow to realize that the sum is greater than its parts, that more
is at stake than his particular chapter. Even more disconcerting
are the demanding, pseudo-democratic political parties. These
factors were responsible for the IFC breakdown in the mid-
1950’s. Presently fraternities are the only student activities
responsible to direct faculty control, excluding, of course,

scholarship.

Judicial Board Proposed
It would seem that the fraternity system can boast of little
if it can’t even govern itself. The proposed IFC Constitution

is a large step, but only a step,
terest is the ney Judicial Board

in this direction. Of major in-
with jurisdiction over rushing,

pledging, depledging, initiation and social functions of the
houses. Elaborate steps have been taken to circumvent the
problems of fraternity allegiance and politics.

The findings of the Judicial Board are subject to the ap-
proval of the Faculty Committee on Fraternities, as, indeed, is
the entire Constitution. In operation, the Judicial Board would
probably hand out a greater number of short-time penalties,

thus, hopefully, lessening the

incidence of severe penalties.

Similar bodies function efficiently and responsibly on many
other campuses in the nation. The Judicial Board concept is an
attempt at synthesizing the best from several of these systems

Much of the remainder of

the Constitution is concerned

with the mechanics of the IFC and would not make for pro-
vocative reading. Suffice it to say that public relations, academ-
ics, and social behavior are all dealt with, along with a multitude
of lesser problems. We are not attempting to say that our docu-
ment is a cure-all for the fraternity system. But it is a construc-
tive beginning upon which can be built a stronger and more

responsible system.

Failings of the New Act
Dr.
how the new act has failed to
achieve its expectations. In the first
round of negotiations with France,
the French proposed to lop off the
high tariffs. This was disadvantag-
eous to the US. since its tariffs re-
semble a wave, whereas the French
tariffs vary little. The U.S. pro-
posed that the low tariffs should be
raised to the average to compensate
for the lowered high tariffs, but it
was rejected by the French. Conse-
quently, negotiations will begin again
in May, and will probably continue
for several years.

a bowling alley, restaurant, etc.,
he is not concerned with private
property; “it is public property,
licensed by the public—and Ne-
groes are a part of the public.”

Kilpatrick, in his closing remarks
before a question-answer period be-
gan, told the conference he thought
Farmer’s side would win the strug-
gle.

“He’s going to win. But what are
you going to lose? A loss of separa-
tion of power, states’ rights, and
property rights.”

Farmer countered with the com-
ment that “no one will lose but the
bigots.”

Both Kilpatrick and Farmer are
educated men, well-versed in cur-
rent affairs and highly respected.
Both are convinced of the truth of
their respective positions on civil
rights, and neither is likely to be
dissuaded.

If what Kilpatrick says—that the
Negroes will “win”’—is true, then
Americans are faced with what ap-
pears to be an insurmountable di-
lemma. Approximately one million
Americans hold the views of Mr.
Kilpatrick, and many of these may
lack his rationality and plain good
sense in coping with increased agi-
tation for racial integration.

derives from his over-concern for
Catherine,) However, this is, per-
haps, the finest real effort to com-
bine all the aspects of the cinema
into a truly full movie. Truffaut may
well be the cinema’s best artist.

I haven’t meant to slight “The
Prize,” but it simply cannot be com-
pared with “Jules and Jim.” How-
ever, it is quite entertaining, and
probably the equal of “Charade” in
its own way. It is an incredible sus-
pense drama, filled with amusing
scenes. Paul Newman _ illustrates
here that he is capable of light
comedy as well as heavy drama. And
Elke Sommer and Diane Baker pro-
vide the most beautiful twosome I
have seen in a single film. I recom-
mend this excellent action and ad-
venture drama to all those who go
to films simply for “entertainment.”

Lord of the Flies” comes to the
Lryic the same day that “The
Prize” opens at the State. I think
it might prove interesting to those
who have not read the Golding
novel, | am certain that it won’t
to those who have.

Top New Academic Listing

For the third consecutive semes-
ter Zeta Beta Tau has taken top
academic honors on campus. Finish-
ing with a 1.613 grade-point aver-
age, they were followed by Sigma
Phi Epsilon (1.579), Non Fraternity
Men (1.563), Delta Tau Delta (1.530),
and Pi Kappa Alpha (1.500).

Outstanding in their improvement
were the PiKA’s who advanced from
twelfth at the end of last year to
fourth this semester; the KA’s who
advanced from fifteenth to sixth;
and the Betas who came up from

 
 

 

eighteenth to eight. The DU’s,
however, reversed the trend and
fell from third to sixteenth.

Translation

By Dr. Barret
Is Praised

Dr. L. L. Barrett, professor of ro-
mance languages, has translated a
Brazilian author’s book comparing
the histories and cultures of the
United States and Brazil. The book
is Bandeirantes and Pioneers writ-
ten by Vianna Moog in Portugese.

Critic’s Opinion

Reviewing it in the Washington
Post, Roberto de Oliverira Campos
said: “Its English translation, in-
trinsically difficult by reason of the
elaborate style in which the original
was written, has been masterfully
done by L. L. Barrett.”

‘Campos, who recently returned to
the Brazilian Embassy in Washing-
ton, called the book “a comprehen-
sive and attention-holding X-raying
of the comparative histories of the
United States of American and
Brazil.”

More Praise

Writing in The New York Times
Book Review, William L. Gossman,
a New York University professor,
judged the book as “an informative
and stimulating exercise in cultural
analysis.”

Charles Wagley, director of the
Institute of Latin American Studies
at Columbia University, termed the
book, “One of the most important
and thoughtful books coming from
Latin America in my generation.”

James Jackson Kilpatrick
James Kilpoarick, editor of the Richmond News Leader, is a well-
known spokesman both for political conservatism and the Southern posi-
tion on civil rights.

Kilpatrick of ‘News Leader’
To Speak Here on March 18

By STIRLING LATHROP

James Jackson Kilpatrick editor of the Richmond News-
Leader will address Washington and Lee students at 8 p.m.
March 18, in duPont. As of yet, he is undecided as to the
topic but in a telephone interview, said he will concern himself
generally with the world and its changes in the next 20-30

years brought about by governmen-*

tal policies and population explo-
sion, and with conservative policies,
responsibility, and principles applied
to the problems of change.

Recently, he has discussed the
problems of and his views on the
race problem with CORE director
James Farmer, and, on television,
with Negro rights leader Martin
Luther King.

On this campus his arguments
have been both attacked and sup-
ported in Ring-tum Phi letters, edi-
torials, and articles. He is noted for
his representation of the segrega-
tionist South, and as opposed to Fed-
eral intervention in state affairs.

Native of Oklahoma

Kilpatrick was born in Oklahoma
City in 1920, attended elementary
and high school there, and gradu-
ated from the University of Missouri
in 1941 with a Bachelor of Journal-
ism degree.

In the same year he began work-
ing for the News-Leader, covering
State and Federal courts and offices.
In 1949, under Dr. Douglass South-
all Freeman, Kilpoarick became as-
sociate editor of the News-Leader,
and in June of that year he became
editor upon Freeman’s retirement.

He has been honored by the Uni-
versity of Missouri for distinguished

New Yorker Writes Up
Nine-Y ear-Old David Wise

David Wise, who appeared at
Washington and Lee under the
sponsorship of ReVue, has attained
more national recognition for his
films. He was interviewed by the
New Yorker for the February 15
issue of the magazine. The article
stated that the editors of the New
Yorker had learned of Wise from
his lecture delivered on this campus
last semester.

New Yorker’s article discussed
Wise’s interests in the art of the
production of films. Wise showed
them his film, “Short Cireuit,” which
is his most recent effort.

Seemingly partial to monsters and
creatures of that variety, Wise, busy
making a new film entitled “Triple
Spice,” has just turned 9 this month.
He is not confining himself to movies
alone: monster comics have become
a part of his talents.

The place from which all of this
work comes is Wise’s basement
workshop. This basement room
reflected in his films and drawings,
acording to the New Yorker, It
is fittingly wild, unkempt, and mons-
ter-like.

‘Distinguished Editorial’ Award
For an editorial campaign in sup-
port of the doctrine of interposition,
the honorary journalism fraternity
Sigma Delta Chi, awarded him its
annual prize for distinguished edi-
torial writing, in 1956. In 1955-56 he
served as chairman for the National
Conference of Editorial Writers. In
1958, Governor Almond appointed
him a member of Virginia’s Commis-
sion on Constitutional Government.
His books are: The Soverign States
(1957), with co-editor, Louis D.
Rubin, Jr.; The Lasting South (1957),
a book on the history of obscenity
censorship and the modern porno-
graphy racket, published in 1960;
and his latest work, The Southern
Case for School Segregation (1962).

Limits & Power Defined;
Judicial Board Established

The new Interfraternity Council constitution has been ap-
proved by the Faculty Committee on Fraternities and ratified

by the IFC itself by a vote of

16-1, with one abstention. The

Faculty Committee was ‘‘very enthusiastic”’ about the new con-
stitution according to Dean Atwood, chairman of the com-

 

Class-Free Day

To Be Dropped
In The Future

Washington and Lee observed the
birthday of one of its namesakes
Saturday by suspending classes.

Although no formal convocation
is held, the university halts opera-
tions to honor George Washington
who gave Liberty Hall Academy
(now Washington and Lee) in 1776
James River Canal stock valued at
$50,000.

This was the first such gift of se-
curities to a college in this country
and Washington and Lee still de-
rives income from the gift.

By recent vote of the faculty,
Saturday was the last time classes
will not meet on Washington’s birth-
day. Instead the free day will be
given just before May Examinations
begin to meet a student request for
a pre-exam “reading day.”

The new plan starts in the 1964-
65 session.

 

Turner Cites
Essay Rules

Applications may now be obtained
for entrance in the Cincinnati and
Colonial Dame Societies essay con-
tests, from Dr. C. W. Turner in 1
duPont Hall.

The Cincinnati Society awards
$50.00 for the best essay. This award
was won by Bob Mottley of W&L
last year. Patton Adams won the
Virginia Colonial Dames contest last
year, which is $200.00 for the best
essay submitted from Virginia col-
leges.

The essays must be 4,000 words or
more and on an original subject in
Virginia colonial and military his-
tory. The essays must be submitted
to the respective committees by May
20, 1964. One essay may be submit-
ted for both contests.

A list of possible subjects may be
obtained from Dr. Turner’s office.

Dr. Turner’s office is located in

 

the basement of duPont Hall.

Judicial Board

The major change contained in
the new constitution is the Judicial
Board. This Board will be composed
of students from the IFC and will
deal with infractions of IFC rules.
Although the Faculty Committee on
Fraternities will have final review
on all cases judged by the Judicial
Board, this is a return ‘to the sys-
tem in which students judge stu-
dents. Any appeal to a decision must
be placed with the Faculty Commit-
tee.

Penalties

In accordance with the Judicial
Board the constitution defines the
jurisdiction of the IFC and clearly
outlines the rules by which the fra-
ternities must abide. The penalties
which will be imposed by the Board
range from a warning, to a fine, to a
suspension, to a recommendation
for removal of the offending frater-
nity’s charter. In giving this added
power to the IFC tthe constitution
contains a great deal of mechanics
in order to insure the smooth op-
eration of the new system.

Other Features

Other features of the new consti-
tution include several measures to
exclude politics from the elections
of IFC officers. Among these are a
committee for making nominations
and a waiting period of a week be-
fore newly elected officers are in-
stalled.

With the ratification of the new
constitution Monday night came the
first amendment which was _ that
freshmen can be initiated with a
1.5 grade point ratio at mid-semester
of the second semester. The constitu-
tion still requires a 1.0 for initiation
at the end of the first semester.

Plans for Rush Week

The new constitution does not
make any changes in Rush Week,
but the IFC is discussing some
changes in the present format for
Rush Week. These new ideas will
be presented in the next month or
so.

The constitution will be put into
effect as soon as Justices can be
elected to form the Judicial Board.
These elections will take place at
the next meeting of the IFC which
will be next Monday.

Occupancy To Be This Summer

 

Reid’s Renovation On Schedule

The remodeling of Reid Hall as
a new home for Washington and Lee
University’s Department of Journal-
ism and Communications is more
than half finished.

D. E. Brady, Jr., the university's
Superintendent of Buildings and
Grounds, said the construction work
is on schedule. Plans call for the
renovation to be completed in late
spring with the department mov-
ing into its new quarters during the
summer.

The facilities will go into use at
the beginning of the 1964-65 aca-
demic year.

Formerly Physics Department

Reid Hall was constructed in 1904.
The physics department formerly
occupied the structure until mov-
ing into the new science building
last year.

Renovation of Reid Hall for the
journalism department began in Oc-

tober, 1963. When completed it will |

provide modern and complete facil-
ities for the academic program of
the department as well as for lab-

advertising, radio and _ television,
photography, public relations and
motion picture production.

partment of Journalism and Com-|

 

munications, said instruction in the
department puts major emphasis on
academic study of the subject, re-
flecting the university’s liberal arts
tradition. He said the heart of the
department’s new facilities will be
the second floor of Reid Hall which
will contain classrooms, library, sem-
inar room and offices.

A classroom seating approximately
100 students will take up one side
of the second floor. Seats will be
arranged on elevated tiers facing a
lecture platform. A projection booth
is being installed in the rear.

A special sound system will permit
radio programs produced in third
floor studios to be piped into the
classroom or lectures given in the
room can be recorded in a control
booth on the third floor.

The library on the second floor
will house the department’s collec-
tion of books, periodicals and news-
papers, as well as historical and
other archive material.

 

Other second floor facilities will |
include faculty offices, a seminar)

: ‘ |room, a student lounge, and a film)
oratories for newspaper procedures, |

storage and editing room.

Riegel said the department also)
recognizes students need practical
experience in journalism and com-|

| munications and pointed out the first |

and third floors are being equipped |

to meet this requirement. |

Edition,

Broadcasting Studio

Three sound-proofed, air-condi-
tioned broadcasting studios will take
up half of the third floor. They mea-
sure 35 by 21, 16 by 21 and seven
by nine feet respectively. One con-
trol room will serve all three studios
and have windows looking into each
of them.

A room patterned after a news-
paper news room will occupy the
other side of the third floor. It will
be equipped with typewriter desks
and a semi-circular copy desk.

Students interested in newspaper
writing and editing will use these
facilities.

Two Associated Press teletypes
will be installed in a separate room
nearby to serve both the news room
and the broadcasting studios.

Other third floor facilities will in-
clude a tape storage and editing
room, a phonograph record stor-
age room, a news room for Home
an advertising laboratory
and drafting room and faculty of-
fices.

Up under the eaves of the fourth

| floor will be a photographic labora-

tory with separate rooms for de-
veloping and printing.

The first floor of Reid Hall will
house the Journalism Laboratory
press now in a small separate build-
ing on campus,

A Bout With Boxing

Romans watched Christians eaten by lions, English
gentlemen baited bears. Thankfully, our civilization has
reached a point where such inhumanities are unthinkable,
and even laughable.

You think so? Watch the contest tonight for the
world’s heavyweight boxing title. Without attempting
rash predictions, we would not be at all surprised if Cas-
sius Clay were killed in the first round.

Boxing is primarily a sport that people watch because
they like to see people hurt. Many appreciate fine points
of technique, but the basic desire to see someone beat
up, knocked out, mauled and perhaps destroyed, is always
there. This is an indictment of boxing in general; but there
are much mote serious objections about the sport as it
stands today. The fighters are not trained well enough;
they do not know how to defend themselves; the princi-
pals involved are actually pawns in a much larger game
that works for profit, and the result is that what should
be a sport played for its own sake becomes a desperate
fight for survival. Most important, it kills people, people
who really have no control over the situation, it damages
their minds if they manage to live—all to satisfy the
screaming crowd. It just isn’t worth it.

Sports writers are agreed that Cassius Clay is not at all
prepared to fight tonight. A few days ago he was knocked
groggy by one of his sparring partners. Anyone who has
seen Sonny Liston box knows what easily could happen.
If Clay becomes another Davy Moore, every supporter
of organized boxing must be ready to accpet a part of the
blame.

 

Overcuts And F’s

A freshman in the undergraduate school has been
dropped from a course with an F for overcutting.

Under the old cut system, a student was permitted
one overcut before being dropped with an F on a second
overcut. Even on the second overcut, it was often pos-
sible for a student to avoid being dropped from a course
by petitioning the faculty committee on absences.

Such is NOT the case under the new system. The
absence regulations instituted this semester state that “If
a student has one unexcused absence beyond the num-
ber of absences permitted... he shall be dropped from
that course with grade F.” Futhermore, the administra-
tion has adopted a policy of strict enforcement of the
overcutting regulation. Only under extreme situations
would petioning the faculty committee get a student’s
F removed.

Washington and Lee students have been complaining
for years about the school’s cut system. Now that a more
liberal policy has been adopted, it would seem that it is
the duty of the student body to prove that they’ve always
been saying—that they are mature enough to accept the
responsibility of more cuts.

The absence regulations have been printed and copies
are available in the Registrar’s Office. Since the new sys-
tem includes a number of rather complicated particulars,
it is extremely important that all students be familiar with
the regulations. So far, few students have bothered to
pick up a copy of the cut system. We join with Dean
Atwood in urging everyone to get a copy, to read it thor-
oughly, and to demonstrate the maturity the new system
assumes.

"Tom Jones’ Rated Down
Despite Critics’ A pproval

By TOM PACE

This past weekend, and perhaps on weekends in the future,
many of you went, or will go, to the big city to enjoy yourself,
a lot more than you are often able to do in Lexington. If you did,
or do, you might have found, or might find, that the only things
you will be able to afford is a film. When this happens I imagine
many will want to see “Tom Jones,” a film which has received a
great deal of favorable critical comment, and which, most probably,
will receive this year’s Academy Award, having already got the
equally infamous New York film critics annual award.

Perhaps then I may say something concerning “Tom Jones” which
you have not heard. I saw it in New York on Thanksgiving Day,
after having stood in line for over an hour, and having missed
the only decent, and free, meal I would have had over the holidays.
But I was hopeful that it would be worth all that. I, apparently
alone, didn’t think it was. “Tom Jones” strikes me as the most over-
rated film of the last several years. After a person has read the novel,
one of the finest and funniest in the English language, I find it dif-
ficult to believe they could honestly consider the film the masterpiece
so many of them seem to think it is.

The film is awfully vulgar in many spots, though admittedly
awfully funny. I choose the adverb “awfully” for it seems sad to
me that raw vulgarity can be as amusing as it sometimes is. I say
“sometimes” because more often, in the film “Tom Jones,” vulgarity
is simply vulgar, and not funny at all. Many critics have reported
on the film’s savage satire, or its biting social comment, which has
no doubt pleased its director, Tony Richardson. But in reality he
fails at both because of his approach. Henry Fielding, in his master-
ful novel, succeeds at both through the use of cleverly written in-
troductions to each of the book’s chapters. The reader laughs at the
way he makes his point and sympathizes with the position he takes.

The Blacks: A Clown Show—by
Jean Genet. Grove Press paper-
back—$1.75.

“One evening an actor asked me
to write a play for an all-black cast.
But what exactly is a black? First of
all, what’s his color?”

So begins Genet’s exceptionally
long one-act play, The Blacks. An
equally appropriate question might
be asked—what exactly is Jean
Genet? He is a sort of modern-day
Villon and Verlaine rolled into one,
and has wandered throughout Eu-
rope as a thief, pimp, beggar, and
homocexual. He has spent a good
part of his life in various prisons,
where he first began writing serious-
ly. After beginning with poetry, he
soon started turning out long prose
narratives, the best known of which,
Our Lady of the Flowers, only re-
cently has been translated from the
French and published in the United
States. Aippearing hand in hand
last year with Our Lady of the
Flowers was a long overdue trans-
lation of Jean-Paul Sartre’s Saint
Genet, a sort of existential hand-
book (800 pages) to an understand-
ing of Genet’s life and actions. In
Saint Genet Sartre has canonized
this poete-voleur for the simple rea-
son that he has set the perfect ex-

ample of making the existential
“free-choice” by picking thievery
as his way of life and sticking to it.
Genet Rises to Objectivity

Genet has progressed from poetry
to prose and drama, and Martin
Esslin in his critical Theater of the
Absurd stresses that this represents
an important change from extremely
subjective to objective writing. To-
day Genet writes only plays, and
the best known of these outside
France is probably The Blacks,
which has ben playing off-Broadway
at St. Mark’s Playhouse since 1961.

Audience Is Symbolic

The Blacks is a_play-within-a-
play. The all-Negro cast is divided
into two groups, one of which per-
forms a ritual of the murder of a
white person. The other group,
whose players wear white masks,
represents a colonial jury of white
dignitaries waiting to pass judgment
on the murdering Negros. There-
fore the Negros performing the mur-
der ritual on the stage are trapped
between the whites in the audience
and the white-masked jury. Thus, if
the play were performed before an
all-black audience it would lose
its symbolic force. To insure there
will always be a white audience to
play for, Genet suggests that each

 
    

  

 

evening a white person should be in-
vited to the theater. “But what if
no white persons accept? Then let
white masks be distributed to the
black spectators. If the blacks re-
fuse the masks, then let a white
dummy be used.” So the trapped
Negroes on the stage are symbols of
the plight of all blacks everywhere
But, as Esslin points out, this is not
a play dealing primarily with the
difference between Negroes and
whites: The Blacks “stand above all,
for Jean Genet himself,”

Intended for Stage

The Blacks has been labeled “as
startling on the printed page as it
is on the stage.” In this I disagree.
Somehow this seems to be a play
which was meant to be seen per-
formed on stage and not to be read.
The quietness of the music of the
colonial waltzes, the grotesqueness
of the white masks, or, in short, the
wierd beauty of the entire play for
some reason cannot be conveyed
powerfully in print. I would suggest
that instead of spending $1.75 for
the book, you should save up an
additional $1.75 and see The Blacks
performed live. Who knows—you
might even be the one white person
in the audience who gives the play
its meaning.

The Spirit of Liberalism

 

R. E. Lee’s Example of Intelligent Stand
Has Vanished Into Petty, Narrow Fears

By LAMAR LAMB

It was June of 1865 in Richmond,
just two months after the close of
a long and devas-
tating war. The
humilitation of
| defeat made the
air tense. In St.
Paul’s Church,
many of the
prominent people
of the city—in-
deed, of the South
—chose to wor-
ship on commun-
ion Sunday. But a
startling thing

 

not unusual day in Richmond’s his-
tory. At the close of the sermon
by Dr. Minnegerade, the first man to
come forward to receive the holy
communion was a Negro. As it is
reported by Colonel T. L. Broun,
who was present on that day, he
was “tall, well-dressed, and black.”
The congregation, not to mention the
good Dr. Minnegerade, was shocked,
humiliated, and confused.
Interestingly enough, General
Robert E. Lee, the leader of a re-
cently vanquished army and beloved
spokesman of the defeated South,
was in the congregation. “General
Robert E. Lee,” according to Colonel

 

and self-possessed manner, walked
up the aisle to the chanal rail, and
reverently knelt down to partake
of the communion, and not far from
the Negro.”

General Lee took this opportunity
to show the people of the South
the way they would have to go in
order to re-establish a peaceful and
successful society. Nor was this an
isolated instance. According to the
noted historian Douglas Southall
Freeman, General Lee freed his own
slaves long before the war began—
a time when a certain U. S. Grant
himself possessed slaves.

In fact, as we look at the charac-

 

LETTERS

Dear Sir:

I would like to extend my thanks
and congratulations to you and your
staff for making this year’s edition of
the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi consist-
ently good reading. I appreciate the
diversity of your articles: on politics,
on current films and literature, on
sports, on campus news; and I ad-
mire the skill of your writers.

Especially rewarding are your
cogent editorials which proceed with
wit and precision to expose the rel-
evant issues of the problems of the
Assimilation Committee, excessive
Executive Committee power, and the
integration of Washington and Lee.

Concerning this last problem, I,
for one, have decided to withhold
further contributions to my Alma
Mater until a less ambiguous and
more realistic stand on the issue has
been taken.

Sincerely,

(P.S. **Pardon the sloppiness of
this letter. It is to remind you that
your most serious and consistent
fault is negligent proofreading.)

Editor,
Tuesday Edition of the
Ring-tum Phi

I was shocked to read of the high-
ly informative exclusive interview
with President Cole regarding the
nearly completed blueprints for the
new gymnasium. As a member of
the “new breed” of undergraduate
students, I see no reason why the
school should consider wasting its
money in an attempt to meet the
standards of the high school from
which I came.

After all, why should we try to
improve upon the state’s finest four
lane, 23 yard pool, the combination
squash-handball courts, always in
the pink of condition with the most
effective lighting system available,
and a gym which finds other schools
engaged in a virtual dogfight to beat
off one another for a spot on our
schedule, and an efficient well-run
locker room inviting student partici-
pation,

I feel that the money currently
set aside for the new gymnasium
could serve a much more worth-
while cause—perhaps paying for an
unlimited supply of stamped assimi-
lation and cold check postcards, new
robes for the E.C., subscriptions to
Sports Illustrated and Ebony for the
library, or, better yet, a new resting
place for Traveller.

A STUDENT

To the editor,

It is a sad state of affairs when
the treasury of Washington and Lee
University cannot appropriate suf-
ficient funds to provide our campus
with adequate sidewalk railing.
Surely it is far better to have none
at all than to have such cheap wood-
en poles which not only look ter-
ribly unattractive but also are in dis-
repair most of the time anyway.

Generals Downed 85-68 In CAC Tourney
Wrestlers Kill H-S, 37-0; Lose To ODC

 

Warren Stewart, wrestling at 177

pounds for the Generals, puts pres-
sure on his pinning “cradle” hold in W&L’s match with ODC, Saturday.

White, Winfield, Smith Pin
W &L Loses ToODC, 15-13

By JIM CROTHERS
Tuesday Sports Editor

After shutting out Hampden-Sydney, 37-0, last Wednes-
day, the General wrestlers lost a heartbreaker Saturday night to

Old Dominion College, 15-13.
In the Hampden-Sydney

match, Kemble White, Peter

Winfield, and Herb Smith all copped pins, with Winfield lead-
ing the way by defeating his opponent in only one minute and
*

twenty-nine seconds.

Butch West and Dick Musick led
the way for the W&L grapplers by
decisioning their foes, 6-1 and 10-1
respectively to give Washington and
Lee a quick match lead of 6-0.
White then downed his opponent in

1:43 at the 137-pound level raising |§

the W&L advantage to 11-0.

Since nine matches were wrestled |,
in this match (instead of the usual

eight) Coach Dick Miller inserted
Graeme Bannerman, a_ freshman
standout, into the lineup at 147
pounds, and Bannerman promptly
secured his first varsity victory by
downing Madison Cummings,

class, easily decisioned his oppon-
ent, 8-1, giving the Generals a com-
manding 17-0 lead when Winfield
gained his pin in the fast time of
1:29 in the first period.

Captain Herb Smith, after gain-
ing a 15-0 lead in his 177-pound
match, finally caught and pinned
Buzz Younte in the second period.
Wrestling for the first time this sea-
son, Dick Daesner had an easy time
of it when Hampden-Sydney for-
feited the heavyweight class. War-
ren Stewart, wrestling in the insert-
ed 191 pound bracket also scored
easily when his match was forfeited
too, giving the Generals the final
advantage, 37-0.

ODC Match

Several very close matches and
two upsets proved costly to the
Generals Saturday, when they were
edged, 15-13, by a strong ODC team.
After falling behind 9-3 and then,
12-8, W&L had pins each time by
Peter Winfield and Warren Stewart
to give them a slight 13-12 advantage
before the final heavyweight match.

In the decisive unlimited division
match, Dick Daesner had trouble
with Jeff Hall, whose size advantage
proved too much, and was decision-
ed9-3, to give the visiting Mon-
archs the 15-13 victory.

After Butch West easily decisioned

SWIMMING FLASH!!!

It was announced yesterday after-
noon that juniors Skip Chase and
Bill Broaddus had been chosen to
captain next year’s swimming team.

 

East Carolina dominated the Gen-
eral’s final meet by sweeping 10
of 11 firsts. John Wolfe took W&L’s
only first in the 500-yard freestyle,
while Bart Taylor took two seconds
in the 50-yard and 100-yard free-
style. However, the Generals swept
all thirds making the meet score
57-38. This gave the swimming team
a 5-5 season.

“I figured that if we broke even
we would have a good season.” So

said swim coach Norris Eastman in
view of the fact that most of the
Generals’ competition is heavily
scholarship dominated. An early loss
to UVa. was dissappointing, but up-
sets over Loyola and Wake Forest
proved the team’s ability, coach
Eastman said.

School records continued to be
broken with freshman Bill Wildrick
setting one each in the 200-yard
butterfly and the 500-yard freestyle.

Backfield, Linebackers Strongest Positions

Spring Football Underway Now;
Generals Face Rebuilding Task

By W&L Information Service
Despite the loss of 16 seniors including his entire first team, W&L’s foot-
ball boss, Lee McLaughlin is not conceding an inch to his 1964 opponents.

“Anytime you lose an entire first team, you have to say you come
down in quality,’ McLaughlin said as he sent his 56-man squad through
spring practice drills.

In team depth Washington and Lee may be better off than last year,
barring injuries. The Generals should be a strong three-deep at every po-
sition except quaterback if the large crop of “promising” freshmen de-
velop fast as sophomores.

The Generals lost three signal callers to graduation, leaving the quarter-
backing chores to rising junior Larry Craig and a rising sophomore Bryant
Kendricks.

“We were real pleased with the way Craig came on at the end of
the season in both leadership and football ability,’ McLaughlin said. “He
has played enough not to be green and we think he can handle the job
adequately.”

 

!

Generals To Open Up Air Attack

Craig showed good passing ability as a freshman and may be called
on to take the airways more and more next fall. “We have realized that
we will have to give up the idea that passing is undignified,” McLaughlin
said. “This fall we are going to throw the ball even if we do not complete
it. We have to open up the opponents’ defenses so our running game can
be more effective.”

“It would be a natural for Bill David,’ McLaughlin said, :“but we are
still thinking about it. Even if we do not use a pro-set we will use more
sets off our Go-T.

David, the Generals leading pass receiver and the co-leader of the
College Athletic Conference last year with 20 receptions for 222 yards and
four touchdowns, has presented McLaughlin with a pleasant dilemma.

David and Tom Crenshaw, the Generals’ co-captains, both play right
halfback, but McLaughlin wants to put both of them in the starting lineup.

Despite the loss of stars Henry Sackett (633 yards rushing) and Stuart
Yoffe (403 yards), the Generals ‘backfield should be strong again this fall.

Joining David, Crenshaw, and Craig are a quartet of top quality left
halfbacks (Skip Chase, Harry Brookby, and Mike Goode) and a trio of
fullbacks (Dan Manson, John Anthony, John Bogart, and Tom Sparks).

Linebacker Position Strong
Only at defensive linebacker do the Generals appear overly endowed
in the line, since most of last year’s first string up-front men have gradu
ated.

But with Joe Miller, Jeff Novinger, Jamie Andrew, and rising soph-
omores Bogart, Chuck Staples, Bill Jeffries and Sparks, McLaughlin is
looking for linebacker to be the strongest spot since the days of Little
All-American Terry Fohs (1958-61).

Tackle will have more overall depth than usual with Starke Sydnor,
shifted from end, returnees Bill Skinner, Jack Kelly, Jerry Croston, Joe
Priddy, and Charles Mayer plus four promising sophomores—Warren

Guard is the Generals’ weakest line spot but Miller, Tom Day, Bo
Earnest, Wickey Stuart, and Curt Jernigan, who is moving from end,
should take up some of the slack created by the loss of the top three men
to graduation.

Bob Barclay and Tersh Baker along with Greg Sharkey and Bob Stauf-
fer give the Generals a capable but relatively inexperienced end corps.
Most promising sophomores are John Miller and Hank Hendrickson.

Center should be improved both in depth and talent with Novinger,
Jim Crothers, Charles Long, and Ben Gambill, all vieing for the wide
open pivot position.

Centre Hands W&L Defeat
As Southwestern Cops Title

BY TOM CARPENTER
Tuesday Sports Writer
Coach Bob McHenry ended his tenure as head coach of
the Washington and Lee basketball team on a sour note as
the Generals dropped an 85-68 decision to Centre College of
Kentucky in the College Athletic Conference Tournament.
It was the Generals second defeat at the hands of the Colonels.

Southwestern surprised by winning the title. In the semi-
finals Centre walloped favored*
Washington, while Southwestern
whipped Sewanee. In the finals the
Tennessee club upset Centre for the
championship. The winners entered
with a 7-12 record.

The Generals played an excellent
game against the Colonels, except
for the fact that they seemed slug-
gish at times. They were just over-

 

powered by a better club. W&L hit
28 of 68 shots from the floor for a
percentage of 41.2, but Centre was
successful on 34 of 69 attempts for
a percentage of 49.3. The Generals
made 12 of 13 free throws, while
the winners connected on 17 of 21.
Centre had a nine-rebound edge.

Atwood’s Cold, Coulling Isn’t

(Continued from page 2)

Coulling never is. He knows why
people take Jolly Ollie courses. He
hates ROTC. He reads most of his
French in translation. He’s made up
stories about Coach Lyles. He'll
borrow your soap at the gym. He
will lend you a dime at the Co-op
even if he doesn’t know you. He’s
read Coacher in the Rye. He is a
mystery to himself or at least he
likes to think so. He’s cryed before.
At college. Slog is really a lot like
you.

But what makes Slog different—
he thinks this but actually it makes
him more like you than the real
you—is that he is tired of being “one
of ’em.” But haven’t you heard it
before? He’s nothing new. But he
said the difference was that he was
tired of it all and guys like him
use to never get tired of it. I won-
der. They probably did. What this
place needs is a kick in the butt
and he said it is finally happening.
He said the freshmen are too damn
cocky and secure. He told me that
fraternities are on the way out.

Old Dominion’s Robert Hogue, 5-1,
W&L lost the next three matches in
very close contests. Dick Musick
upset, 5-3, Kemble White was tied-
up and edged 3-0, and Jamie An-
drew was beaten by ODC’s captain,
Robert Gutterman, by the close
score, 5-4.

With Washington and Lee behind
9-3 in the match, Winfield pinned
his opponent in 2:40 to make the
score 9-8. W&L captain, Herb Shith,
was then upset by Richard Harris
of Old Dominion, 5-2, to make the
overall match score 12-8.

Wrestling for the first time this
season, Stewart showed fine form in
pinning Tom MeMillan in two min-
utes with a devastating cradle hold.

 

Chase, Broaddus Elected
(Continued from page 3)

Junior Wolfe had lower his 500
freestyle time before Wildrick’s ef-
fort and his record in the 200-yard
freestyle stil Istands. Co-captain-
elect Bill Broaddus and freshman
John Lunde are co-holders of the
200-yard backstroke and freshmen
Wildrick, Gary Bokinsky, Steve Les-
ter, and Taylor hold the record in
the 400-yard freestyle.

Continuing his interview, Coach
Eastman stated that, discounting
losses from next year’s team, the
1964-65 swimming team should be
his strongest to date. Freshman
Wildrick, Lunde, Taylor, Bokinsky;
sophomores, George Bokinsky, John
Lifter; and juniors Broaddus, David
Geer and Skip Chase give W&L
depth and first place potential.

I wonder...what did happen to
hell week? And we never have wo-
man above the first floor any more.
And the new housemother doesn’t
drink. The Hot Nuts will never re-
turn...at least Atwood says so.
And I know a guy who is staying
here during spring vacation to write
a paper. Can you imagine? He told
me tonight that we were seeing the
beginning of the end. He’s even
glad. He said integration was com-
ing, despite the no-nigger-clause.
He said the basketball team could
use a couple of big ones. He re-
minded me that the Negro students
from Hampton hardly caused com-
ment. What’s happening anyway?
What’s going on here, Mongolian
Minks? What’s become of happy
hour and the “shows”? And what's
the Golly Bridge Hunt Club up to?
Slog is apparently suffering an
identity crisis. He’s not taking notes
any more. He is wondering if you
really are happy when the bell rings
at one o'clock on Saturday. He won-
ders if there is such a thing as
intellectual responsibility. He said
he’s sick of the creeping code of
“greatguyism” which prevades this
place. He laughed at initiation.
But why should I tell you all this?
I'm graduating. I listened to him af-
ter everyone left the dining room to-
night. He didn’t each much supper.
He say’s he sick of the whole mess.
Seems like he means it too, but then
it's the middle of February. Be
spring pretty soon. Macon and the
Blueridge Parkway. Anyway, he had
probably been to the Liquid before
supper. But he said you are on the
way out. You and your goddam big

know, and really, I don’t care too
much. You see, I’m graduating.

THE SLOW RUSH

Illustrated below is the membership pin of a brand-new na-
tional fraternity called Signa Phi Nothing. To join Signa Phi
Nothing and get this hideous membership pin absolutely free,
simply take a pair of scissors, cut out the illustration, and paste
it on your chest.

Let me hasten to state that I do not recommend your joining
Signa Phi Nothing. The only thing I recommend in this column
is Marlboro Cigarettes, as any honest man would who likes
good tobacco and a good filter, whose heart is quickened by a
choice of soft pack or Flip-Top Box, and who gets paid every
week for writing this column.

Tam frankly hard put to think of any reason why you should
join Signa Phi Nothing. Some people, of course, are joiners by
nature; if you are one such, I am bound to tell you there are
any number of better organizations for you to join—the Cosa
Nostra, for example, or the Society for the Placing of Water
Troughs in Front of Equestrian Statues.

Ge

 

Cutd cut at Cele it ot vor lest

But if you insist on joining Signa Phi Nothing, let me give
you several warnings. First off, it is the only fraternity which
admits girls. Second, there is no pledge period; each new mem-
ber immediately goes active. Perhaps “inactive” is a more ac-
curate word: there are no meetings, no drives, no campaigns,
no sports, no games, no dues, no grip, and no house.

The only thing Signa Phi Nothing has in common with other
fraternities is a fraternity hymn. In fact, two hymns were sub-
mitted to a recent meeting of the national board of directors
(none of whom attended). The first hymn goes;

Signa Phi Nothing,
Shining star,

How we wonder

Tf you are.

The second hymn, rather more poetic in content, is to be

sung to the tune of Also Sprach Zarathustra:
A Guernsey's a cow,
A road ts a lane,
When you're eating chow,
Remember the mein.

Pending the next meeting of the national board of directors
(which will never be held) members are authorized to sing
either hymn. Or, for that matter, Frenesi.

Perhaps you are wondering why there should be such a fra-
ternity as Signa Phi Nothing. I can give you an answer—an
answer with which you cannot possibly disagree: Signa Phi
Nothing fills a well-needed gap.

Are you suffering from mental health? Is logic distorting
your thinking? Is ambition encroaching on your native sloth?
Is your long-cherished misinformation retreating before a sea
of facts? In short, has education caught up with you?

If so, congratulations. But spring is upon us and the sap is
rising, and the mind looks back with poignant longing to the
days when it was a puddle of unreason.

If—just for a moment—you want to recapture those care-
less vaporings, that warm, squishy confusion, then join Signa
Phi Nothing and renew your acquaintance with fecklessness.
We promise nothing, and, by George, we deliver it!

(Continued from page 2)

ter of the leader of the Confederate
military effort, we see that in many
ways he was very advanced fer his
times. He lived in a time when dis-
crimination against Negroes was an
accepted fact. Even Abraham Lin-
coln, in his inaugural address, said,
“I have no purpose...to interfere
with the institution of Slavery...
I believe I have no right to do so;
and I have no inclination to do so.”
Yet, General Lee had seen fit to
free his own slaves long before Lin-
coln was elected President. And at
a time when Grant still had slaves,
General Lee was kneeling with a
Negro before a chanal rail in rec-
ognition of the equality of all men
before God. It is partially because
of his forward-looking nature that
Robert E. Lee is still honored as
not only a great general, but a
great man.

We at Washington and Lee are
fortunate in having this man as one
of the contributors to our school
and tradition. Through the years,
his contribution has been singled out
as probably the most significant
and certainly the most dear. But we
at Washington and Lee have certain-
ly forsaken at least some of the tra-
dition of this great man. He sought
to make this institution one which
would lead the South and the nation
in all phases of education. But we

‘We Have Forsaken Traditions’

, have been unable to follow his lead.
We find ourselves, not in a posi-
tion of leadership, but of backward-
ness. We have not taken a stand
recognizing the equality of men, we
have not endeavored to lead our
society in the Christian tradition.
These were things dear to the heart
of Lee, as is evidenced by his tak-
ing stands which were far ahead
of his time. But we have grown
small. We have let pettiness re-
place greatness. We have replaced
wisdom with ignorance, and prog-
ress with stagnation. We have for-
saken the tradition which Lee, in
supreme sublimity, established.

There are those who say, “I think
that Negroes should get a break but
I think they’re going about it the
wrong way.” Let these people show
that they are sincere, that they are
willing to act on their beliefs. Let
them act in the tradition of Lee, a
man who could take an intelligent
and courageous stand.

It has been said that our tradi-
tions are falling. I do not know if
this is true. But I can see that one
tradition is dead. It has been killed
by pettiness and fear. Let those who
moan the passing of the Old South
in the worst sense of the word con-
sider the entombment of some of the
Old South in the best sense of the
word. We see tradition forsaken,

 

and truly we should mourn,

to the smallest detail, so you’ll be

ready for any and all invitations to greet this gala season!

YOU CAN PLAY IT COOL—no matter how perspiration-prone
you are! Paradoxical as it may seem, the addition of synthetic
fibers has subtracted an incredible amount of weight from the
standard worsted-and-mohair blends of dress suitings! Those man-
made miracle fibers will do you another favor when it comes to

spic-and-span crispness that has

nothing to do with old-fashioned, suit-of-armor starch! And some-
thing else your shirts should shun is the old-fashioned riverboat
gambler look. That fancy shirt-front with the lace and ruffles
should be worn only for a TV guest shot—flat, pristine pleats are
the order of the day in smart circles!

ILS—ALWAYS DETAILS!

Exactly. For instance, studs and cufflinks
should be dark—black pear! or something
in the same spectrum, and as simple as
possible. No Maharaja of Baroda effects
allowed (unless, of course, you’re the
Maharaja of Baroda!). The wearing of

And look for a revival of the more gener-

Goldwyn, Jr.
To Talk Here

By SAM McCHESNEY

Next Thursday at 7:30 Samuel
Goldwyn, Jr., son of one of the most
celebrated producers in film history,
will speak here on the modern pic-
ture industry.

Mr. Goldwyn has recently com-
pleted producing and directing his
first motion picture, “The Young
Lovers,” starring Peter Fonda, Nick
Adams, Sharon Hugueny, and De-
borah Wally.

Speaks Friday Morning

Under the auspices of Journalism
Professor O. W. Riegel, he will
speak Thursday evening in the
Journalism Lecture Room on “The
Motion Picture Today.” The next
morning at 9:30 in Payne 6, he will
address Mr. Riegel’s Introduction to
the Motion Picture class. The subject
of this lecture will be the production
problems of his not yet relezsed
film.

A graduate of the University of
Virginia, he began his career as a
producer-director of documentary
films for N.A.T.O. One of these pro- |
ductions received first prize in the’
documentary class at the Edinburg
Film Festival of 1952.

Independent Producer

After his work with documentary
films, Goldwyn returned to the
United States and began producing
and directing live television in New
York. Recently he returned to Hol-
lywood as an independent motion
picture producer.

Some of the films he has produced
are: “Proud Rebel,” “Huckleberry
Finn,” “The Shark Fighter,” and
“Man with a Gun.” Presently he is
planning an adaption of Howard
Fast’s novel April Morning.

 

Student Concert Society
Sponsors Organist Taylor

On Sunday, March 1, George Tay-
lor will give an organ recital in
Lee Chapel at 4:15. This recital is
being presented by the newly form-
ed Student Concert Society, an or-
ganization created to encourage in-
dividual talent to perform on this
campus. It will attempt to hold a
variety of concerts including both
popular and classical music to give
all those that are interested a chance
to participate.

This first concert by Taylor will
be of particular interest to those
who appreciate good org organists
and organ music, according to a
member of the Concert Society. Es-
pecially of interest will be the re-
cently restored organ to be used
in the Chapel for the Concert.

Baker, Booth, and Supon

The second concert planned will
present three vocalists who have
already distinguished themselves
through the Glee Club. John Bak-
er, Philip Booth, and Bill Supon will
be on the program Sunday afternoon
at 4 p.m. April 12, This program
will include popular as well as clas-
sical selections.

It is hoped that a third concert
can be held on Friday, April 24,
devoted entirely to jazz and popular
singing by students ensembles.

‘Dr. Faustus’ To Open
Next Thursday Night

By CHARLIE FLIPPEN

Dr. Faustus, the Troubadour Thea-
tre’s second production of this sea-
son, opens next week.

The play will run Thursday through
Sunday. Curtain time is 8:15 p.m.

This year is the 400th anniversary
of the birth of Christopher Marlowe,
author of Faustus. Dr. Cecil Jones, di-
rector of the production, chose this
play, in part, to help commemorate
the event.

Faustus is an Elizabethan play in
the tradition of high tragedy. It con-
cerns the struggle of a young Ger-
man scholar learned in philosophy,
medicine, mathematics and theology,
whose consuming pride and thirst for
knowledge lead him to engage in sor-
cery and magic.

When the play opens Faustus is se-
curing some books on magic from two
of his comrades. Valdes and Cornelius.
With their urging he goes alone into a
grave to conjure.

To Faustus’ delight his incantations
cause Mephistophilis, a devil from hell,
to appear. Amazed with his own suc-
cess, Faustus promises to give Meph-
istophilis his soul in return for
Mephistophilis acting as his servant
and for 24 years of super-human pow-
er.
Mephistophilis returns to hell to dis-
cuss this bargain with Lucifer. Faus-
tus meanwhile listens to the argu-
ments of the Good and Evil Angels.
He decides to make the agreement.

The contract made Faustus begins

Glee Club Leaves On Tour;

Will Sing I

The W&L glee club departs next
Friday morning, March 6, for the
Philadelphia area and its spring tour.
On the agenda are three singing
engagements.

The first is scheduled for Friday
afternoon at the Shriners Hospital
for crippled children. That evening
the glee club travels to the Tatnall
School in Wilmington, Delaware for
a performance. The high-spot of the
weekend is the Saturday night con-
cert with Beaver College, a girls
school in Philadelphia.

The glee club will present a wide
variety of selections, including re-
ligious pieces by Martin Shaw, Bach
and Handel, folk songs by H. Willan
and J. W. Work, two unusual con-
temporary pieces by V. Persichetti, a
humorous number by C. W. Cadman
and some familiar show tunes by
Kern, Poter and Bernstein.

Baritone John Baker will be the
soloist on a medley from the West
Side Story. Sophomore baritone Rob
Vaughan will have his first solo with
the glee club in “Climb Every
Mountain.” A musical burlesque,

Philadelphia

“Conceited,” soloists will be tenors
Dan Manson and Jim Mell, bass Phil
Booth and baritone Baker. Baker
and Booth will also solo in a number
of folk song selections.

The tours are intended to foster
alumni interest as well as publicize
Washington and Lee to prospective
students. Last year’s tours were to
Wilmington, Delaware, and Atlanta,
Georgia.

Sunday morning the glee club will
sing at the Lexington Presbyterian
Church. This is an annual engage-
ment. This year the group will sing
a number by Bach, “Now Let Every
Tongue Adore Thee” as well as sing-
ing the amens and participating in
congregational singing.

Scheduled for later this spring
are performances with Randolph-
Macon and Longwood college.

Currently being prepared is the

At the opening session of the convention the afternoon of

May 4, Rep. Poff will welcome dele-*

gates to the convention on behalf of
Virginia Republicans. The congress-
man also has been asked to introduce
the keynote speaker of the conven-
tion, Dr. Walter Judd, former con-
gressman from Minnesota who key-
noted the 1960 Republican National
Convention.

Poff will ride with Dr. Judd in the
mile-long parade through Lexington
which proceeds the opening session of
the Mock Convention.

12 Years In Congress

Poff first was elected to Congress
in 1952 and has served continuously
ever since. He is the third ranking Re-
publican member of the House Ju-
diciary Committee, and serves on the
Joint Senate-House Immigration Pol-
ity Committee.

He is the only Southerner and
youngest man to be elected secretary
of the Republican Conference in the
House of Representatives.

Poff was selected one of the 15
outstanding young men in American
politics in 1958 and was chosen by the
Junior Chamber of Commerce Vir-
ginia’s Outstanding Young Man of
1954.

He is a graduate of Roanoke Col-
lege and the University of Virginia
Law School and has practiced law in
the Radford, Va., firm of Dalton, Poff
and Turk of which he is now senior
partner,

Convention Chairman Phil Sharp
expressed the gratitude of the Steer-
ing Committee for the opportunity to
have the prominent young Republican
present at the convention.

Student Service
Elects Memkers

On Tuesday night, February 25, the
Student Service Society elected six
new members to fill the positions va-
cated at the end of the first semester.
Out of the students interviewed, two
juniors and four sophomores were
elected.

The two juniors chosen were Jon
Supak and Jim DeYoung. Supak, the
newly-elected president of the ZBT
house, is from Virginia Beach, Vir-
ginia. DeYoung, a Phi Kap from Ken-
ilworth, Illinois, is also the president
of his house.

The four sophomores selected were
George Bokinsky, Gene Hatfield, Jos-
eph Richmond, and Ken McGraw.
Bokinsky, who is on both the swim-
ming and track teams, is a Phi Kap
from Petersburg, Virginia. Hatfield, a
Sig Ep from Chattanooga, Tennessee
is the Publicity Director for the Glee
Club.

McGraw, Assistant News Editor for
the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi, is a Phi
Gam from Memphis, Tennessee. Rich-
mond is a Beta from Charlottesville,
Virginia.

The Student Service Society was
formed for the purpose of assisting the
University administration in the field
of public relations.

The chief function of the Society is
the introduction of prospective Wash-
ington and Lee students to life on
this campus from a student’s point of
view. The prospective freshman as
well as applicants for scholarships are
given a tour of the campus with a de-
tailed explanation of Washington and
Lee traditions and _ institutions.

The SSS also aids the administration
in various ways on Parents’ Weekend,
Alumni Weekend, and SIPA Week-
end.

The present officers include Ken
Lane, president, a Phi Delt senior
from Richmond, and Dick Kreitler, a

EC Appoints
Hetnzerling
To Committee

Tuesday night the Executive Com-
mittee appointed senior John Hein-
zerling to the Student Control Com-
mittee, filling a vacancy created by
the February graduation of an old
committee member.

Heinzerling, an SAE from Texas,
is a member-at-large on the Control
Committee. The man whose place he
is taking is Kemp Morton, who fin-
ished law school last month. With
Heinzerling’s appointment the com-
mittee is again at its full strength of
nine members.

President Bill Noell, in announc-
ing the appointment to the Ring-
tum Phi, praised Heinzerling’s qual-
ifications to be a member of the
important committee. Heinzerling
has been on the swimming team
four years, is a Texas chairman for
the Mock Convention, and is imme-
diate past president of the SAE
house.

Heinzerling is also working as
assistant campaign manager for
Goldwater in the convention, is a
member of the intramural board,
and has served his fraternity as
vice-president and rush chairman.
He is a Dean’s List student.

The Student Control Committee,
now in only its second year, handles
matters of student discipline. Sub-
ject to review by the faculty Ad-
ministrative Committee, the student
committee is empowered to inflict
serious punitive measures in cases
of student misconduct.

A Resurrected IFC?

“A ‘do-nothing organization”
whims of ‘The Hill”... ‘‘reeking with apathy and indiffer-
ence.” These are excerpts from editorial attacks of recent
years against W&L’s Interfraternity Council. Such criticisms | ?°
had been rightfully made ever since a decade ago when the
IFC, because it was abusing its authority, had to surrender to
the faculty all its judicial powers over fraternities. This loss
of power had marked the beginning of the end of the IFC
as an influential body.

Last Monday night, the council took a first giant stride
toward regaining its former status. A constitution was ratified
that will place under IFC jurisdiction disciplinary control over
W&L’s eighteen fraternities. This control will be embodied in
a Judicial Board, which will be assuming a great deal of the
prerogatives formerly held by the Faculty Committee on Fra-
ternities.

What restored the faith of the faculty in the IFC that it
should grant this concession? Due credit should be given to
the council’s president Art Broadus and his officers. They
worked long hours during the fall semester to produce a sound
and well-stated constitution. With unusual skill and diplomacy
they overcame their biggest obstacle, that of winning the ap-
proval of the Faculty Committee and fraternity leaders.

The success of Broadus and his officers is a promising move
toward a revived IFC. The competence with which the Judicial
Board, which will be formed next week, will exercise its au-
thority is to be a decisive testing-ground for whether the council
can continue its forward stride. The IFC for the last ten years
has been sharply criticized for its many shortcomings in the
face of unbounded potentiality. Perhaps last Monday was the
starting point for a healthier realization of this potential.

Our Own Kildare:
Hippocrites Hamperman

When raging fever first grew high

And men fell out, they knew not why,

When bodies were racked with terrible pain
And fear of death over all did reign,

A voice above all the tumult rang loud

And in a tone more humble than proud
Proclaimed to all that the end was near,
(For the victims or disease we could not hear.)
The great Doctor Hamperman is at hand

To rid you the pestilence from all the land.

 

Then O great Hippocrites give us your song
Tell us kind sir why you do no wrong

O great Hamperman sing us your song
Dictate to us and we'll go along.

Hippocrites is it the flu that’s so rageous?

How can it be, quoth he, when it’s not contageous.
Then it is pneumonia that causes such treason
“Absolutely not,” and he gave no reason.

Harken to me my wandering fold

It is the simple matter of the common cold.

Then O great Hippocrites etc.

Off my lad and be on your way,

Two aspirin take you every day,

And if by chance you are not better

Your tongue is black and your face is redder
Take four more, and if you’re worse

Don’t call me, call the hearse.

For I am the magnificent Hamperman

Hair so red and face so tan.

Tell to me all of your woes

And Ill diagnose you from head to toe.

Then O great Hippocrites etc.

O wonderful unerring physician

Relieve me of my miserable condition

My stomach throbs, my bowels are sore

Say you can help me, tell me no more.

Hippocrites hesitates, and after much consideration,
Diagnoses the symptoms as constipation.

If a laxative instead of a scapel were used

To rid one of appendecting blues

Instead of being engulfed in the darkness of night.

Then O great Hippocrites etc.

And then there was your famous diagnosis

Of calling it tonsilitis when mononucleosis.

Sir Edward Jenner would give you hard knocks

For saying poison oak when it was small pox.

Vesalius, Vicary, and Galen are dead

Now the title “Prince of Physics” lies on your head.

But the ducks on your pond go “Quack, quack, quack.”

Sexual Revolution—Part II

 

Motives—A Measure of New Morality

By KEN LANE

In our first installment, we dis-
cussed the emerging triumph of
contemporary philosophers over the
traditional negativism toward sex.
This triumph is evidenced in the

popular rejection of extreme sexual
repression as an unhealthy outlook
toward a “good and natural” expres-
sion. This “revolution,” of morals,
however, has left us with a void and
we must presently concern ourselves
with a more positive and meaning-
ful approach that will accompany
our break with the past.

Perhaps the most significant
problem in our redefining of val-
ues is the question of premarital
sexual intercourse. It involves one
of the strictest taboos of our moral
heritage, i.e., that sexual inter-
course not performed for the pur-
pose of procreation is evil. From
the traditional viewpoint, a couple
had always to consider the pos-
sibility of childbirth in the indul-
gence of intercourse. A male and
female not prepared or willing to
accept the responsibility for the
consequences of their act were

LETTERS

EpitroR

Editor, Ring-tum Phi

Having read so many interesting
articles of late concerning integra-
tion at Washington and Lee, I
thought I would get off of my lacka-
daisical duff and draw up a work-

 

 

_|able plan for integrating this hor-

rible, bigoted Institution. I hope my
ten point program will arouse some
interest in the student body.

1. Elect members of the student
body to select qualified Negroes to
come visit the University—good
choices for this committee would
be men such as Lamar Lamb, Rod
Cockshutt, Tracy Harrington, Roger
Paine, Jim Ledbetter, and Tom Su-
pak.

2. Bring these “choice” Negroes to
W&L and let them see if they like
our system—let them visit Lee
Chapel and a typical fraternity
house—the Kappa Alpha _ house
would probably extend many cour-
tesies.

3. Get these prospective students

dates at neighboring girls’ schools f

and take them to a combo party.

(The combo should be integrated ot

so no one will be offended.)

4, Require all Washington and Lee| |

students to wear be-bop hats, com-
bo shoes, pegged pants and a red
ear coat so our visitors will feel at
home.

5. Paint one-half of Lee’s marble
statue black so that our visitors
will not seem discriminated against
by one of our founders.

6. Require each student owning

committing a social wrong. Hence,
the fulfillment that an unmarried
couple enjoyed in intercourse was
offset by their anxiety over the
misfortune, the evil, that might
result,

What has pulled the rug from un-
der the feet of the traditional moral-
ist, however, is the improved ef-
fectiveness of contraceptives. “With
modern contraceptives and medical
advice readily available at the near-
est drugstore, or at least a family
physician,” stated a biology profes-
sor at the University of Illinois,

 

 

“there is no valid reason why sexual
intercourse should not be condoned
among those sufficiently mature to
engage in it without social conse-
quences and without violating their
own codes of morality and ethics.”

This advanced technology has not
only removed the basis of the tra-
ditional taboo against premarital
sexual intercourse, it has accentu-
ated the possibility of a second func-
tion, a sacramental function, that
makes more real and personal the
relationship between a male and
female. For the sharing together of

 

this powerful experience may serve
to reinforce the communion of mu-
tual love and devotion that exists
between mature, sincere individuals.

This alternative role of sexual
intercourse runs us into a very
basic problem in the treatment of
morality as a whole—the problem
of motives. It is true, is it not,
that in the final analysis we place
moral judgment of individuals
not on the basis of actions in
themselves, but of the motives be-
hind them. We can condemn no
one unless we know his underly-
ing intentions. Thus, in judging
the rightness or wrongness of an
act such as premarital intercourse,
we can not divorce ourselves from
a consideration of the spirit, the
attitudes, with which the act is
committed, The traditional moral-
ist, whose value systems are so
arbitrarily delineated, failed to
recognize the essentiality of this
added aspect.

It is for this reason that tradi-
tional morality, and in particular
traditional sexual morality, can not
survive in a society of free-thinking,
rational individuals. Such a society
rebels against the idea of having
our decisions predetermined by pre-
scribed rules and conventions. We
reject the purely stimuli-and-re-
sponse existence in which our con-
duct is automatic, unthinking, so-
ciety-conditioned. Consequently, our
future promises a greater freedom
for the individual, in sex and all
of human behavior, to exercise his
reasoning faculties and achieve
fulfillment. The test for our gener-
ration is, are we ready for such
freedom.

Party Picks

Dark-Horses As Candidates

By DREW BAUR

With Mock Convention just a
swallow away, political pros in West
Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Mary-
land anxiously await the formal can-
didate endorsement of the influen-
tial Cro-Faun-Jo Party.

Right now the party is having
a great deal of trouble deciding
between four pop-
ular, well-known,
and well-qualified
candidates, Wil-
liam  Knowland,
Louis Lefckowitz,
Mike Ditka, and
Sherman Adams.
Although the con-
vention is at pres-
ent deadlocked on
the 69th ballot,
side reports say a
compromise can-
didate is about to be decided upon.
Some speculators are mumbling
that this candidate might be clear
thinking, Byron De La Beckwith.
Whoever the party nominee is, this
decision will affect the nominations
of these important states.

Party spokesman Tom Fauntle-
roy commented, “Within the month,
we expect to have unanimous agree-
ment concerning our candidate and
the campaign wheels will begin roll-
ing within minutes after the candi-
date is announced.”

 

Springs
So far the list of combos for
Springs Weekend is among the
most impressive ever seen on any
college campus. The Crystals, Chif-

 

fons, Orlons, 5 Royals, Maurice Wil-
liams and the Zodiacs, and Dr. Feel-
good are among those already antic-
ipated. This weekend seems to be
rapidly overtaking Fancy Dress as
the highlight of the W&L social

season,
Fights
We certainly hope the wily editor
of the famed boxing pamphlet, the
Ring something or other, will let the
boxing public know about how Son-
ny threw the fight, unless he is too
busy hiding Clay’s casket under the
print shop.

BEST BETS FOR THE WEEKEND:

JFK. Right now, of course, Johnson
does have fantastic national support—
but this can’t last longer than his new-
ness in office and the sharp memory
of the assasination in Dallas.

Gallup and Harris Polls show that
Nixon—with his nemesis Kennedy no
longer on the scene—has the backing
of substantially more Republican Par-
ty members than any of the active
candidates, The fact that he has been
the consistent front-runner in polls of
the rank-and-file is illustrative of the
tremendous advantage he has over
any other noncandidate: a national
name and personality.

Nixon’s years of service in Wash-
ington give him more experience in
foreign policy than any other Repub-
lican candidate—and more than
President Johnson. Nixon’s _ trips
abroad since 1960 haven’t hurt him at
all in this respect, and he is planning
more travelling before long.

If Rockefeller and Goldwater cancel
each other out in the primaries, or if
each proves too extreme for nomina-
tion by the convention, Nixon, obvi-
ously, will be available. If he should
happen to receive an unusually large
write-in vote in the New Hampshire
primary, his position as the compro-
mise candidate would be immeasur-
ably strengthened. And the upcoming
test is not the first New Hampshire
primary in which Nixon has had to
rely on write-in votes; he also was

 

pushed in a write-in campaign in the
1956 New Hampshire primary.

It all adds up to the fact that Nixon
is, almost unbelievably, in great shape
and could win the nomination if he
plays his cards well. He has been do-
ing just that in a series of speeches
that make the other GOP candidates
look like inepts, and it’s no more than
could be expected from the man who
almost beat Kennedy in 1960 and who
is now probably the best of our na-
tional campaigners.

This despite the fact that in a “nor-
mal” presidential year Dick Nixon
wouldn’t draw any attention to speak
of. As a two-time loser, perhaps he
could count himself lucky if he land-
ed a job helping Ike once again and
they worked together as_ television
commentators for the national con-
ventions.

But nobody is taking Goldwater and
Rocky seriously, and nobody will un-
less one of them comes out of the
primaries with a bag full of victories.
Of Nixon’s fellow noncandidates, the
most serious, Scranton, may face even
greater disadvantages than Nixon
himself seemingly faces.

Scranton lacks any definite national
character, and he lacks experience in
politics and in government. He would
make a poorer showing against John-
son, as the polls show.

For these reasons, Scranton must

Journalism Department Presents

By BOB MOTTLEY
The Department of Journalism is
presenting Robert Flaherty’s Louis-

p.m. in Payne Hall.
This is one of the

best American
films ever produc-
ed; it describes

the life of a Cajun
family in the bay-
ous of Louisiana
through unobtru-
sive and_ poet-
ic photography.
Made in _ 1949,
this film has be-
come a major
classic in its gen-
re; Virgil Thompson composed for its
soundtrack the finest original score
for any American movie.

Locally, Kings of the Sun and
The Magnificent Seven are show-
ing at the State and Lyric. The
first should be avoided unless one
can enjoy (at this stage of his
maturity) a particularly inept re-
tread of the swords & shields &
frigid princess syndrome. The
second is an old friend to most of

so inclined to drive 52 miles to
see it, it has been cut to a running

further comparison is possible. One

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Varsity to Play Alumni;
Fohs, Gummey Return

By JOHNNY GRAHAM
Friday Sports Writer

Washington and Lee’s first football weekend of 1964
gets underway tomorrow at 2:30 on Wilson practice field.

The varsity football squad,

which has been working out

since February 12, takes on a tough alumni team in the third

renewal of the annual varsity-alum-*
ni rivalry.

The record stands at 1-0-1 in favor
of the varsity. Last year’s game was
a 28-0 rout. The teams tied 8-8
in 1962. Before that time, the spring
game was an intrasquad affair.

Coach Mac has still not decided
upon the starting team, but prom-
ises that everyone will see action.

The alumni team is coached by
law student Bob Payne, a 1963 grad-
uate, and boasts 11 returning alum-
ni to go with 13 seniors from the
1963 team.

Two Little All-Americans will
spark the alumni’s ranks, as well
as seven members of the 1961 un-
defeated, untied team. Terry Fohs,
a linebacker, and Charlie Gummey,
a 215-pound halfback, are the Little
All-American returnees.

Seniors from the 1961 team in ad-
dition to Fohs are center Jerry
Hyatt, quarterback Robin Wood,
halfbacks Jim Hickey, a 9.7 100-yard
dash man, 215-pound Dave Tharp
and Richard Mosby, and tackle Tom
Budd.

The two captains from the once-
tied 1960 team will also be back.
They are Bobby Funkhouser, now a
coach at Collegiate School in Rich-
mond, and center Courtney Mauzy.

Payne, who will play tackle in
addition to his coaching duties, is
assisted by Raymond Raedy, a law
student from Notre Dame. Raedy will
handle the defense.

Seniors from last year’s squad
include ends Buck Ogilvie, John
Madison and Mike Jenkins, tackles
Bob Henley and Jimmie Sylvester,
guards Bill Gossman, Bill Angel and
Steve Davenport, centers Mike Shef-
fey and Dan Flournoy, quarterback
A. J. Barranco, and halfbacks Henry
Sackett and Stuart Yoffe.

Coach Mac looks for a personal
duel developing between Yoffe and
Bill David, whom he calls “as fine a
pass receiver as W&L has ever had.”
Yoffe has sworn to guard David
man-for-man.

Quite a game is in store, says
Payne. “We're short on conditioning
but long on experience, talent and
desire. We also have added some
new wrinkles to the Go-T in order
to take advantage of our speed and
size in the backfield.”

The game promises to be a fitting
kickoff for the Generals’ 1964 season.

Riflemen Shoot
In NRA Meet

With three losses this week be-
hind it, the Washington and Lee
Rifle team shoots tomorrow at Fort
Lee in the National Rifle Associa-
tion Sectionals.

Six schools, including favored
VMI and VPI, will shoot in the
N.R.A. meet. With Virginia, William
and Mary, and Richmond the rest of
the opposition, Coach Jim McSheffrey
feels the Generals have a _ good
chance of finishing third.

The riflemen lost matches held
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday
after beating George Washington last

Young Defense

e J

Spells ‘Maybe

By BRUCE GARRETT
Friday Sports Writer

Washington and Lee lacrosse pros-
pects are the best ever—maybe.

So far defense is Coach Bob Mc-
Henry’s only apparent worry on
an otherwise solid team. Bill Goss-
man is the sole returning defensive
letterman.

W&L faces its usual tough sche-
dule this year and has added two
new teams, Williams and Villanova.
McHenry sees Virginia, Williams
and Washington (Mo.) as the three
hardest games on the schedule.

The Generals open their regular
season March 26 at home against
Williams. Two days before, Swarth-
more will be here for a full-scale,
preseason scrimmage.

The attack positions are manned
by veterans Carroll Klingelhofer,
Randy Wootton, and Mike Michaeles.
The midfield has three returning let-
termen in John McDaniel, Syd But-
ler, and Jay Bowersox. Goalie Pete
Noonan is a two-year veteran.

McHenry also sees excellent fresh-
man prospects in Duncan Lamont
on attack, Bob Frost and Bob Os-
troff in the midfield, and Lance Ben-
dann and Teddy Leach at defence.

One of the unknowns of _ this
year’s team will be depth. It is still
uncertain whether the reserves and
freshmen can come through in the
way necessary for a winning sea-
son.

All in all it appears that Mc-
Henry has a team which is more
solid in both talent and experience
than any other in recent W&L his-
tory. It should make a _ significant
improvement over last year’s 3-7
record.

The Generals’ attack game will
still be nothing to rave about, but
should be a vast improvement over
recent seasons. The midfield appears
both strong and experienced enough
to more than competently carry its
share.

Season prospects—an improved
team with an mproved record, which
means a bit better than .500.

The Schedule: March 26, Williams; | ¥

March 28, at Hofstra; April 11, at
Duke; April 18, Villanova; April
25, North Carolina; May 1, Wash-
ington (Mo.); May 7, at Loyola
(Baltimore); May 9, Towson; May
14, Virginia.

SAE has captured the school basket-
ball championship, while KA’s
vaunted handball team fell before
Beta to throw that sport into a
three-way tie.

As the basketball season drew to
a close last night, SAE, as expected,
proved their supremacy, though not
without a scare.

PiKA’s Joe Framptom and Bob
Stauffer teamed up to lead PiKA to
a 21-19 halftime lead. Midway
through the second half the school
champ, for the second consecutive
year, came on to take the lead and
eventually win, 50-44.

For SAE it was their seventh
straight victory this year. Beta
captured second place on Randy
Offutt’s twisting layup with 15
seconds remaining in last night's
game against Sigma Nu. Beta won
46-44 to extend their record to 6-1.

In other tournament games played
this week and last, SAE beat Sigma
Nu 32-22, and Beta 41-32. Sigma
Nu ran away from PiKA 69-39, and
Beta did the same, 43-23. The best:
1. SAE, 7-0; 2. Beta, 6-1; 3. Sigma
Nu, 5-2; 4. PiKA, 4-3; 5. Delt, 3-1.

The General’s basketball team un-

The 5-10 West Virginia junior led
the team’s offense this season, aver-
aging just short of twenty points
a game. His 19.9 per game mark
placed him eighth among the state’s
high scorers.

Coach Bob McHenry made the
announcement yesterday, although

‘Matmen to Meet Old Foe,
Wrestle Cavaliers in Finale

By LES GRANDIS
Assistant Sports Editor

the year, the General wrestlers

are assured of another winning season.
The team takes its 6-4-1 record to Charlottesville to meet

team Saturday night.
* The Generals are hoping to avenge
their disappointing 19-8 showing
against virtually the same team last
year. Then the closest match was be-
tween 157-pounder Pete Winfield and
Alex Wells. Winfield is hoping for a
reversal of last year’s 2-1 decision.

The Cavaliers will be hurt by the
loss of their captain Jeff Boehm, who
will miss the rest of the season be-
cause of an illness, and Lance
Schaeffer at 177, because of a leg
injury.

Cavaliers Have Slumped

After a fast start, Coach Meb
Turner’s Virginia wrestlers have
been in a slump since their semes-
ter break, winning only one of their
last three matches.

W&L captain Herb Smith, who
wrestles at 167, will lead the Gen-

team. Also wrestling tomorrow will
be Butch West (123), Dick Musick
(130), Kemble White (137), Graeme
Bannerman (147), Winfield (157),
Warren Stewart (177) and Dick
Daesner (heavyweight).

The probable starters for the Wa-
hoos are Peyton McCrary (123),
Hal Clark (130), Bill Patten (137),
Dick Tucker (147), Wells (157),

3 Gary Stewart (167), older brother of

W&L wrestler Warren Stewart, Jim
Meighen (177), and Bob Bokelman
(heavywegiht).

Thus far the Cavaliers have had
a good season and the only school
against which both teams wrestled,
North Carolina State, was too pow-
erful for either.

With the national championships
almost a month away, Coach Dick
Miller doesn’t expect any Generals
to want to go. It would require a
month of hard work after a long
season, at a time when many boys
would be interested in spring sports.

 

Twombly Hedges On Job

Washington and Lee Athletic Di-
rector E. P. “Cy” Twombly said

He said that, contrary to rumors,

by Tim OKeefe

Cassius Clay has always claimed

he would “upset the world,” and
Tuesday night he did just that.
There have been charges that the
fight was fixed, but these grumblings
can probably be dismissed as only
inane comments from disgruntled
Liston supporters. Liston’s legend
of invincibility is forever shattered.

In the sports pages of the daily
Papers, most columnists and writ-
ers are falling all over themselves
trying to find out where they were
wrong in picking Liston.

In__ pre-fight = articles, there
wasn’t a single sports editor who
gave Clay a chance. Liston will
murder him in three, they said—at
least by the sixth.

But everyone was forgetting Cas-
sius Clay and what he had been
rather loudly saying. Clay had pick-
ed round eight to make him great.
Instead it was round seven which
sent him to heaven.

Many have been wondering about
Liston’s shoulder injury. The con-
sensus is that Liston could not have
hurt it in the first round, as he
claims, and still do as good a job
as he did. Still, this isn’t saying
much. Liston missed more punches
in that fight than most fighters do
in a career.

It did take some of the glamor
away to find that Clay did win be-
cause of Liston’s shoulder injury.
Until the seventh round both fight-
ers were tied according to the offi-
cials’ score cards, and the way things
were going, it probably wouldn’t
have been much longer before Clay
ran away with the fight.

Liston seemed like a big, clum-
sy bear chasing a youthful, taunt-
ing opponent. If Clay couldn’t see
during most of the fifth round, as
he claims, and if Liston was pour-
ing out everything he had—let’s
face it. The man with the loud
mouth did just as he said he was
going to do. He made a lot of
wild claims and backed up every
one of them.

It didn’t turn out to be a lion-
eat-Christian affair as a few mem-
bers of the campus press had
feared it would. Nor did this mem-
orable piece of journalistic non-
sense come about: “Without at-
tempting rash _ predictions, we
would not be at all surprised if
Cassius Clay were killed in the
first round... the fighters are not
trained well enough... they don’t
know how to defend them-
selves...it just isn’t worth it.”

In the handball tournament there
was no such clear-cut decision. No
fewer than three of the four league
champions tied for the top spot with
2-1 tournament records.

Beta, Delt, and surprising KA all
came up with identical marks. PiKA,
meanwhile, lost all three matches.

It all came about this way. Delt
beat Beta, 4-1; KA then beat Delt,
4-1, making KA the favorite; then
Beta came back and upset KA, 3-2.
Meanwhile, KA and Beta were both
downing PiKA. And then last night
Delt downed PiKA throwing the
tournament into a three-way tie.
As a result, the handball tourna-
ment will continue again next week,
with God only knows what results.

In bowling, matters are only
slightly less confusing. The regular

Only it didn’t come out that way.
They tied, 2 games apiece, with Phi
Kap having the edge on pins, 2249-
2233. Now both clubs have identical
3-0-1 records and must meet again
to determine the winner.

Kappa Sig earned their tourna-

sist from Tom Pace who rolled a
blistering 615 series on games of

SAE won their tournament spot
the easy way, when Phi Delt for-
feited. And Phi Psi had a close call
before clinching the final position,
by virtue of a 2-2 tie with DU. Phi
Psi, with a 3-0-1 record, finished just
half a game ahead of Pi Phi, who
closed at 3-1.

was Phi Gam’s only one in four out-
ings.

know that this isn’t his year. If he
wants to be president he must bide his
time.He would be foolhardy to risk
a brilliant career now, whereas Nixon
now has absolutely nothing to lose.
If Scranton really doesn’t want to be
president, as he claims, then he will
continue to ignore his backers until
it is too late. In that case, Nixon will
have to be the favorite to try one
more time for the Grand Old Party.

Freshman Swimming

Led by Joe Houston, Rick Chit-
tum and Howard Busse, each of
whom was instrumental in two
Washington and Lee victories, the
W&L freshman swimming team
easily downed Lynchburg’s frosh
last Friday, 61-33.

Houston won both the 100 and 50-
yard freestyle events with his best
times this year, while Chittum, after
swimming a stint with the winning
W&L medley relay team, copped a
first place in the 200-yard breast-
stroke event. Busse was also a mem-
ber of the General’s victorious re-
lay team and later on in the meet
was a winner in his speciality, the
200-yard butterfly.

A well planned wardrobe is the only real guarantee of a well-
dressed appearance. A common mistake made by young men is to
buy clothes that attract them without considering how they’ll fit
in with the clothes they already own. ‘Wardrobe buying” doesn’t
mean bankrupting yourself buying matched sets of everything at
once, but the suits, shirts, ties, shoes and hats you buy this Fall
must coordinate and complement each other. Let’s take a look at
your new wardrobe for Fall.

NATURAL SHOULDER, NATURALLY—

The natural shoulder silhouette remains
the outstanding fashion favorite among
young men this Fall, cut on straight-hang-
ing lines, with center-vented jackcts,
flapped pockets and narrow, medium
length lapels. Generally they’ll be seen in
three button models, but the influence of
vigahrous New Frontier styling has oc-
casioned some trend toward two button
jackets. Trousers are tapered and pleat-
less.

THE RISING HAIRLINE... isn’t a per-

sonal grooming problem you have to face
yet, but an indication of the big rise in
popularity for hairline stripings in young
men’s suits this Fall. You’ll see them
against every color background, but par-
ticularly gray. Gray, seen in a wide range
of tones from light chalky grays to dark
combinations with blue, black and olive,
is the fashion-first color in natural shoul-
der tailored apparel this Fall. Of course,
the blue suit is always with us, and a good
bet for your basic dress-up suit is a dark
blue or blue-gray worsted. And, in both
blues and grays, fashion excitement for’
Fall is generated by large muted glen
plaids. Blues, grays and olives all get to-
gether in new olive and olive-blue casts in
all-wool, worsted and polyester blended
fibers.

SEMI-DRESS STRIPES ... describes the
wide range of big wide stripes in dress
shirts this Fall. These stripes, for high-
interest contrast with your solid color
suits, are bigger and wider than ever, and
fit into the semi-dress, less-than-big-date
category. Red and white is the front-run-
ning favorite, but check out the wide blue
and white and olive and white combina-
tions, Definitely dressier are the plain
white and solid color oxfords in soft
shades to coordinate with the new hair-
line stripes. Widespread collars won’t go
with your natural shoulder suit. Choose
a medium spread button-down or a snap-
tab collar.

TIEING THE KNOT. ..on your fashion package doesn’t simply end
with matching neckwear colors to your suit. Not only color, but
pattern must be balanced with your suit and shirt. Natural shoulder
styling calls for regimental neckwear, and regimental stripes are
getting bolder and bigger to match new wide stripings on shirts.
For a change of pace, and still in step with your natural shoulder
suits, take a look at the muted dark tones in new printed figures on
silk foulard or wool challis ties.

FROM THE GROUND UP ... is the way to build anything, includ-

ing a well-dressed appearance. To coordinate with all your natu-
rally tailored apparel, your basic shoe wardrobe should include a
pair of dark red-brown cordovans or cordovan color calfskin laced-
fronts, and a pair of black slip-ons or laced-front models in either
plain toe or moccasin design. Stick to plain ribbed socks in matching
and coordinating colors.

TOPPING IT OFF ...is best done with a hat, not with a wild thatch

of wind-blown hair. You'll complete the slim, natural look of your
wardrobe with a narrow, snap-brim hat, underscored slightly by a
tapered crown. And you'll find both raw edged brims and welt
edges on the newest headwear. Both gray-brown and olive with
black bands will coordinate with your new gray or olive natural
shoulder suit.

OUTERWEAR, FORIAAL ViEAR, SKI WEAR... and much more

.are all coming up in the months ahead. Outerwear next time.
See you then.

EC To Pick
Recipient
Of Award

By MIKE HASH
Assistant News Editor

Established last February by the
Executive Committee, the Dean
Frank J. Gilliam Award is given
annually to the one student who is
considered by the EC as_ having
made a valuable contribution to stu-
dent affairs. It is not necessary that
the student make this contribution
through any office or organization,
and the achievement may take the
form of outstanding work in one or
several fields.

The award consists of $200 to the
recipient, and $150 to be given to
some organization or department
within the University as designated
by the recipient and approved by
the BC. The money
from the student bedy fund.

March 23 Deadline

Nominations for the award are
presently being received by the EC
from any member of the student
body or faculty. The nominations
must be submitted no later than
Monday, March 23 to the President
of the student body.

Announcement of the recipient
will be made by the EC in early
spring. A permanent plaque placed
in the Student Union is engraved
with the name of each winner. Any
student in the University is con-
sidered as a possible recipient of
the award.

First Recipient

The perpetual scholarship was first
awarded to Tom Rains, 1963 gradu-
ate, who received the award on
the basis of his work as chairman
of the Student Control Committee.
Rains designated part of the Award
for use in the Moffatt Seminar
Room.

Given solely on the basis of serv-
ice to the school, rather than in
consideration of need, the Gilliam
Award recognizes the many years of
outstanding service which Dean Gil-
liam has given to the University.
The award also emphasizes an area
not previously recognized by the
faculty or student body.

Samuel Goldwyn, je. Io Speak :
To W&L Audience On Thursday

A man with one of the famous
names in the motion picture indus-

try will lecture at Washington and |
Lee at 7:30 p.m. Thursday in Payne |

Hall.

He is Samuel Goldwyn, Jr., son of
one of the most celebrated producers
in film history and now a producer-
director in his own right.

Goldwyn will speak Thursday on
“The Motion Picture Today.”

He will also speak to students
taking the Journalism Department’s
course, “An Introduction to the Mo-
tion Picture,” at 9:20 am. Friday.
O. W. Riegel, chairman of the Jour-
nalism Department and instructor of
the motion picture course under
whose auspices Goldwyn is appear-
ing, said visitors will be welcome
at the class meeting.

In the Friday morning class Gold-
wyn will discuss his recently com-
pleted but unreleased film, The

 

Young Lovers. He is making his de-
but as a producer-director with this
film which is set in a large, modern
university and stars Peter Fonda,
Nick Adams, Sharon Nugueny and
Deborah Walley.

Goldwyn grew up in Hollywood
and then graduated from the Uni-
versity of Virginia in 1957. He began
his film-making career as a produc-
er-director of documentary films for
NATO. One of these received first
prize in the documentary class at
the Edinburg Film Festival in 1952
and he was awarded a special com-
mendation by President Eisenhower.

After spending some time as a
producer-director of live television
in New York, Goldwyn returned
to Hollywood as an independent mo-
tion picture producer.

Among his films are Proud Rebel,
Huckleberry Finn, The Shark Fight-
ers and Man With a Gun,

COLVIN

The Troubadour Theatre will present The Tragical History
of Dr. Faustus Thursday through Sunday nights, March 5-8.
This, the second play of the season, will celebrate the 400th
anniversary of the birth of its author, Christopher Marlowe.

This famous play involves the plight of Faustus, a scholar

 

learned in law, medicine and theol-*
ogy, who takes up the study of magic
to feed his pride. To satisfy his
burning thirst for knowledge and
power, he agrees to sell his soul to
the devil Mephistophilis, for twenty-
four years of super-human power.
From this point on, his career is
marked by a great waste of his gen-
ius upon cheap trickery in the lavish
courts of the Emperor, Carolus V,
and the Pope of Rome.

Morton Heads Cast

Heading the cast of 25 is Tim Mor-
ton in the role of Dr. Faustus. Re-
membered for his roles in Othello,
Zoo Story, and Inherit the Wind,
Morton will make his first appear-
ance of the season. Accompanying
Morton will be Steve Colvin who

Concert Series Slates
Strauss Opera Here

The Canadian Opera Company of
Toronto, Canada, will appear in
Lexington this week. The appear-
ance will be the second event of the
Rockbridge Concert-Theatre Series.

This group, Canada’s premiere
professional operatic repretory com-
pany will present their production
of John Strauss’ Die Fledermaus at
Waddell School on Wednesday,
March 4, at 8:15 p.m.

Makes Annual Tour
Organized in 1950, the Canadian
Company formed a charter opera
division in 1958 which has annually
toured the eastern United States as
well as Canada.

 

Members of the Company appear-
ing here in Strauss’ comic opera are
Alan Crofoot as Alfred, Sheila Pier-
cey as Adele, Constance Fisher as
Rosalinda and Cornelius Opthof as
Baron Bisentein,

Other Actors and Roles

Joseph Macko will play Dr. Blind
and Ivan; Peter Van Ginkel will
play Dr. Falke; and William Cope-
land will sing the role of Frank,
the prison warden. Phil Starke sings
Prince Orlofsky.

The musical direetor and pianist
for this production is W. James
Craig and the general director is
Herman Geiger-Torel. The Opera
will be sung in English.

 

will play Mephistophilis, the devil
agent of hell. He has acted in Othel-
lo, Krapp’s Last Tape, and most re-
cently as Eisenring in Biedermann
and the Firebugs.

Also to be seen in one of his rare
appearances is Dr. Keith Shillington,
Associate Professor of Chemistry at
W&L. Dr. Shillington will play the
role of Gluttony, one of the Seven
Deadly Sins.

Female Roles Filled

Faustus will feature two Lexing-
ton High School students, Kendall
Jamison and Betsy Letcher. Miss
Jamison will play the part of Helen
of Troy whom Faustus conjures up
to be his lover. Miss Letcher will
play two parts, following the Eliza-
bethan custom of doubling roles. She
will first appear as one of the Seven
Deadly Sins who come from hell to
delight Faustus with tales of them-
selves, and later as the beauteous
paramour of Alexander the Great.
Both girls have been active in Trou-
badour and L.H.S. productions.

Low Comic Roles

To add some fun to an evening
of high tragedy several actors, will
appear in low comic roles, which
were included to please the cruder
tastes of Elizabethan audiences. Joe
Volpe, seen last Fall as Schmitz in
Biedermann, will play two roles:
first as the hapless Horsecoarser
who is doubly outwitted by crafty
Faustus, and secondly as the not-so-
pious Pope whom Faustus taunts
at his court in Rome.

Lockhart Handley will double as
the Clown and Robin, both of whom
find that fooling with magic can
have unpleasantly surprising results.
No less surprised are Rafe, a mis-
chievous cohort of Robin’s played
by Lew Davis, and the incredulous
Vinter, played by Sid Parham. Their
anties are contrasted to the sincerity
of such a figure as the Old Man,
portrayed by Starke Syndor.

Additional Cast Members

Adding splendor to the spectacle
are Pete Stelling in the role of Em-
peror Carolus V, Gay Reading and
John Moore, who double as the sor-
cerers Valdes and Cornelius, and
later as Lucifer and Beelzebub, and
the Seven Deadly Sins, played by

and Lee Chapter was established in
1911.

Membership in the Society is an
honor conferred in recognition of
scholarly attainment in the liberal
arts and sciences. In electing new
members the Society considers but
two criteria—scholarship and char-
acter.

 

UCA Expands ‘Pulpit Program’
To Supply 3 Pastors in March

The University Christian Asso-
ciation, under the leadership of Beta
Chuck Long and Dr. Louis Hodges,
has expanded its program of supply
pastor work.

Throughout recent years, members
of the UCA have filled pulpits in
the Rockbridge County area which
have been vacant. This month W&L
students will conduct services and
deliver sermons in three Methodist
churches in Fairfield, Buchanan, and
Buena Vista.

Leadership Forum will meet to-

, have found it impossible to take care
of all the churches in their circuit.
In one ease, a Methodist minister
has six churches in his circuit. The
UCA will supply three of these
churehes each Sunday in March,
while the minister himself serves
the other three, on a rotating basis.

This system has made it possible
for most pulpits in Rockbridge
County to be filled every Sunday.

About ten W&L students are in-
volved in UCA weekend activities
regularly, and more than ten in
addition make contributions to the
program once every two weeks. The
| UCA’s normal activities include the
| handling of church services at Clark
| Mountain Church, aid and instruc-
; tion to patients of Western State,
| and the tutoring and maintenance of
| a Boy Scout troop at the Boys’ Home
| in Covington.

Workers Of The School—Arise
Now Is The Hour Of Need

No W&L student, however apathetic, could possibly
overlook the vigor with which the Buildings and Grounds
people have attacked two of W&L’s persisting local prob-
lems: what to do with the “old co-op,” and how to provide
the University community with more convenient parking
space. The nature of the “‘attack”’ suggests that somebody
up there doesn’t think any problem exists.

Therefore, (not wanting to be critical, mind you),
we must ruefully observe that not only is Washington and
Lee’s foreign policy antiquated (e.g., refusal to recognize
the Negro race), but the University’s domestic policies
are also at a standstill. It’s possible that potential legisla-
tion is being tied up by the Rules Committee; or, it’s pos-
sible that the imaginations of those responsible for build-
ings and grounds are still in neutral.

We think that it’s time this school got moving again!
The challenge of the ’60’s must be answered! The Old
Co-op Bill and the Parking Bill aren’t so controversial that
they couldn’t be aired in this session—then at least we’d
know that some action might be taken by 1974. And the
fact that most of our allies (Sewanee, Randolph-Macon,
Duke, Wake Forest) have recognized the Negro race
ought to make us think about that problem too.

If W&L’s battalion of leaf-rakers, snow-shovelers,
and manure-spreaders would lift their heads out of the
ground they’re supposed to keep green, and put in an
eight-hour instead of four-hour day, perhaps we could
anticipate a campus this spring as beautiful as we've all
been told our campus is. Perhaps the grass would actually
be green. Perhaps the unsightly, over-filled trench which
has scarred the front campus for the past few months
would be graded and reseeded.

Remember, Buildings and Grounds Dep’t: the times
are too grave, the challenge too urgent, and the stakes too
high—to permit the customary passions of three-hour

lunch breaks.

 

Current Cinema

Nominations for Awards
Point up Cinema Polttics

By TOM PACE

What price, Norton? I wonder what some people mean when
they talk about romantic irony. I am beginning to have reservations
about recommending “Soldiers in the Rain,” but there is so much
good in it that one can easily overlook the bad. Why is everybody
so down on “Cleopatra”? It seems that you have to climb to one
side or the other, when, in fact, it is better to ride the fence. “Cleo-
patra” has some nice things in it.

The story isn’t bad. And contrary to what appears to be general
opiinon, Richard Burton is quite good as Mare Antony. Admittedly
it is overlong—way overlong—and Blizabeth Taylor is not well cast
nonetheless, judgment has been too hasty. Whether or not to go
depends on what you would do with the three and a half hours
if you didn’t go than on anything else. There is no reason to be
bitter simply because the movie isn’t the best ever made. Only
three or four of those are made each year.

The More Deserving?

The Academy Award nominations this year have proved, more
conclusively than ever before, that they are worthless judgments
of merit. “Tom Jones” was not the best movie of the year, but the
Academy has cleverly arranged it so that “Tom Jones” will get the
award by nominating much lesser films against it. Why ignore “Hud,”
“The Great Escape,” “The L-Shaped Room,” “This Sporting Life,”
“814.” “The Victors,’ “The Wrong Arm of the Law,” “Soldiers in
the Rain,” “Charade,” and “The Prize,” some of which were not the
best, but all of which were superior to that sloppy, little “Lilies of
the Field,” that sloppy, big “How the West Was Won,” and the
controversial “Cleo.” Why nominate Rex Harrison, Albert Finney
(who might well have won for “Saturday Night and Sunday Morn-
ing,” but not for “Tom Jones”), and Sidney Poitier, only to ignore
Steve McQueen, Marcello Mastroianni, and Jackie Gleason, to name
a few more deserving?

The answer is very simple. Because the Academy must pay hom-
age to the money-wielding producers and the New York film critics,
all of whom deserve much less. There is really no festival which
gives noteworthy honors, with the possible exception of the Lon-
don Film Festival. You must be satisfied with giving your own rec-
ognition which, sadly, the receivers cannot appreciate.

Strangelove

Once in a long while, however, a film does come along which both
merits and receives praise. Such a film is “Dr. Strangelove: or How
I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.” And if “Strange-
love” is ignored next year by the award-givers, it will more than
make up for this by being one of the biggest box-office successes
for the last five years. This is a movie that may be recommended
with only one qualification; if your father or uncle is a general you
may be hurt.

The one film in town this week really worth seeing is playing
for the last time tonight. It is “This Sporting Life,” and is at the
Lyric. Coming soon to the Lyric is “La Notte,” the second of An-
tonioni’s trilogy, and perhaps the finest film which will come to
Lexington this Spring.

Tony Walker is perhaps the campus’s most proli-

scripts that is by no means thin, infused with his own
personal, yet effective, imagery and language. I have
picked these two pieces because thy show his charac-
teristic concern with death and life in the senses
coupled with his experimental style and diction.

Though some unthought chasm will inhale

All this life, our frail existence:

Brown, cinnabar, earth red; colors of the mood,
Soundless tones on chords of cool autumn air.

And the crescent moon,

Leaving behind the night of some other land,
Fills one moment-point in all the black-hood of cold

With musty light golden.

Has come into the sky as the guardian

Of fountain, spring, and hunter.

Has thrown warm beams down the hallway

From dome, ‘to corridor and passage

Into ‘the winter, severed from autumn
The moon has undergone the exchange

From crescent to the cold facade

And is blown in cirrus waves

Across the empty square, its streets, into the dark wake

Of buildings, vacant and awaiting my steps.

The white dove’s still flight has come to rest in the eves
Of a tavern. From over the casement flees

Their silhouettes bent in narrow umbras across the floor

And, thus startled, the bird who passes
Through my dark portrait into the future

Agree or Disagree -It’s on the Way

By ROD COCKSHUTT

Although it may not look like it
now, it’s inevitable. No matter how
strongly we may
feel about the
whole thing we
can be certain it
is coming to
Washington and
Lee in the very
» near future, just
| as it is coming to
the rest of Amer-
ica.

Consequently, it
would seem irrel-
evant and unnec-
essary to argue about whether we
want it or not, or whether we're
ready for it or not. It’s coming.
That’s final.

In the light of all this, then, it

seems to me that this ought to
be a time of honest soul-searching

and preparation. What can we as
students at Washington and Lee do
to make the transition easier, for
adjustments will surely have to
be made.

We must ask ourselves how the
fraternities will react, for instance.
What changes will be made in the
social life of the students? How will
the athletic teams take it? I predict
that some of them will disband for
a while, but that others will cer-
tainly take their place. Some stu-
dents will come to class less than
they have been, but that’s to be
expected. I feel certain, however,
that not a single student will drop
out of school because of it all. Stu-
dents at Washington and Lee are
bound to be above that kind of ac-
tion.

But we do have to face it. The
whole appearance of the University
will be changed by this single event.

I personally believe that it will be
an improvement, and ‘that the school
and the town, will be more pleas-
ant to be in when it happens. But
then you may disagree with me.

To all those who still adamant-
ly believe it will never come to
Washington and Lee, and to those
who are unalterably opposed to
it we can offer little consolation.
The issue has been settled and
I feel certain that the trustees and
Administration are reconciled to it
as well. Some of them may even
be anxious for it. It is therefore
our responsibility as students to
try to face up to this as educated
men and without undue emotion-
alism. In the end it is bound to
bring more pleasure than pain,
and more warmth and beauty to
to the University.

Yes, to be sure, it is coming. Spring
is coming soon.

 

The Revolution Of ’63

 

HaveSouthern Negroes Really Changed?
The “Myth’and the New Negro Outlook

Editor’s Note: The following ar-
ticle was written by Dr. Louis
Hodges, W&L Department of Re-
ligion, for the Waynesboro News-
Virginian. It is the first of a series
of articles under the general
heading, “The Revolution of ’63.

By LOUIS W. HODGES

The events of last summer have
prompted the apt label, “The Revo-
lution of ’63.” Bloody demonstra-
tions in Birmingham have caught the
eye of the nation. Atlanta road-
blocks, Danville protests, Washing-
ton marches, federalized National
Guard at the University of Alabama,
bombs in churches, funerals for four
young Negro girls, fire hoses, paddy
wagons, protest posters— these are
the tangible symbols of the revo-
lution.

Negro Behaves Differently

But what does the revolution it-
self symbolize? What is new in ’63,
something not fully present in ear-
lier decades? Above all else the new
ingredient is the changed Negro.
The Negro of the 60’s is radically

different from the Negro of the
50’s in one essential respect: he has
found new power and determination
to press for his rights. He behaves
differently. This simple but deeply
important fact has prompted a wag
to read N.A.A.C.P., “Niggers Ain’t
Acting like Colored People.”
There must be no mistake about
it; the Negro has no new desires or
needs. He has always been restless,
and the South has always been dim-
ly aware, though not fully conscious,
of that fact. We have tried to forget
the powder keg beneath. Toward
that end we have devised special
myths to give ourselves assurance.

The Southern Myth

One of the most comforting myths
handed me as a boy in Mississippi
went something like this: “Our Nig-
gers are happy like they are. They
don’t want to mix with white folks.
Eleanor Roosevelt is just trying to
make trouble among our Niggers.
They know their place and are hap-
py to stay in it.”

The Negro was glad to have the

white power structure believe this
myth. He was anxious to play the
role of “Uncle Tom,” to be the
“good Nigger.” To have done other-
wise would have brought down the
wrath of the white, maybe in mild
form and maybe in the form of a
lynching. The Negro tried to appear
happier than he actually was, and
for good reason.

Revolution Has Begun
Things have changed. The Negro
is not so helpless as before, and he
knows it. He no longer plays the
role of “Uncle Tom.” The revolu-
tion is on. Self-deception becomes
increasingly difficult for the white.
The Klan, the Councils, and the
noose are proving ineffective, and
the white feels helpless without

these time-honored methods.

In the future we may expect fur-
ther outbreaks of violence in a futile
attempt to put the Negro “back in
his place.” These will not work; we
are dealing with a new Negro. Here-
in lies the root of the revolution of
63.

  
    

Coun Syuire :
By ADDISON BROCKENBROUGH

“Addison Goes to Sem”

Last Saturday evening, the 29th
of February, our roving commenta-
tor, Addison Brockenbrough, was
among the merry-makers at the an-
nual Winter Formal at the Southern
Seminary School.

The fete was held on the institu-
tion’s beautiful campus, atop a
wooded hill overlooking the com-
munity of Buena Vista. Addison
and companions arrived at the
school promptly at 8 o’clock from
an all-afternoon pre-dance cocktail
party. The company was in high
spirits.

The campus was alive with ar-
riving dates, porters, and cab
drivers—a_ scintillating scene! At
the door we were met by two
gracious doormen in white jackets
who ushered us into the main
waiting room. This spacious hall,
so beloved to those who frequent
it, was bedecked with festive dec-
orations and given a homey touch
by a giant gas log in the fireplace
at the end of the foyer. While
dates were being summoned, Ad-
dison made light conversation with
the beautiful and gracious chap-
erones who filtered among the
guests with the greatest of ease.

Not a few of the young gallants
gasped when the ladies began to
descend the staircase into the wait-
ing room! Lovely and breathtaking
in their white, red, and pink chif-
fons (so much in the vogue at pres-
ent) ‘the young ladies looked like
angels. The hall began to fill with
revelers, and soon it was OFF TO
THE DANCE!!

The ball was held in the school
gymnasium which had been decor-
ated especially for the occasion. Ad-
dison and group were thrilled with
the streamer and crepe-paper dec-
orations that bedecked both the main
dance floor and the surrounding
portico. The crowning touch was
provided by two grand canopies
suspended above the floor which
were sources of constant attention
to dancers because of their amazing
ability to seem constantly ready to
fall. Daring conversation pieces!

Dancers swirled to the music of
the well-known Freddy Lee Or-
chestra, Freddy and band, (ob-
viously primed for the occasion),
not only played for dancing, but
also delighted guests and dates
with feature jazzy numbers which
were quite good. Off to the side of
the band at the end of the dance
floor was a quaintly-lit parlor
where distinctly non-alcoholic re-
freshments were served to the
weary dancers throughout the
evening.

All agreed that the high point of
the gay evening was the beautiful
and well-planned figure. As the or-
chestra played soft music, the “belles
of the ball” and their handsome
escorts paraded along the floor. The
girls all had on full-length, white,
formals—generally of the plunging,
strapless variety. Addison and com-
panions looked on in delight. Notable
among the figure escorts were local
socialites Timothy Henry and Har-

Jimmy Sylvester (74) try in vain to block the pass for the Grads.

 

In another action shot of the Varsity-Alumni football game, Buck

just grabbed a short Alumni pass.

Barranco Tosses Three For Grads;
McLaughlin ‘Satisfied’ With Game

Three touchdown passes by
proved decisive Saturday as the

the Alumni’s A. J. Barranco,

“old men” trounced the Var-

sity, 20-0, in the annual windup game for Spring football

practice.

Barranco’s aerials connected with Buck Ogilvie, Henry
Sackett, and Stuart Yoffe, while Sackett ran for a two-pointer

 

after the second TD for the tallies.*

Although the varsity gridders
were less than impressive, General
Coach Lee MeLaughlin felt that
since he was “interested mainly in
giving everybody a chance to play
and seeing how they would hit,” the
outcome of the game does not neces-
sarily mean curtains for next year’s
football hopes.

W&L’s head mentor added that
“by and large, we were pleased
with Spring Practice and the im-
provement throughout the two-week
span.” McLaughlin pointed out that
the Alumni had virtually all of
last year’s starting offensive team
playing Saturday, and that, in ad-
dition, had such stalwarts as Jerry
Hyatt, Terry Fohs, Bob Paine, and
Charlie Gummey.

Coach Mac said that the results
of the game show “that we have our
work cut out for us, but,” he con-
tinued, “we have a number of dedi-
eated hard-working boys who will
hit,” and with coaching and work
he expects to be able to field a
“representative” team next fall.

Joe Miller and Jeff Novinger
were praised for their outstanding
defensive play, while Skip Chase
received the coaches plaudits for
offense. On the whole, the coach
said, he was also very pleased with
the offensive fullback play.
OUTLOOK FOR NEXT YEAR:

Coach McLaughlin pointed out
that every offensive position would
have to be re-filled due to the
graduation of 17 Seniors, How-
ever, the General boss felt that
W&L might have a chance for a
500 season, provided “the boys
meet the challenge and are will-

ing to work.”

Frosh Hoopsters
End 9-3 Season

By DICK DeWAUGH
Tuesday Sports Writer
With victories in four of their last
five games, the Washington and Lee
freshman basketball team finished
with a 9-3 seasonal record, one of
the best frosh team records ever
compiled at W&L according to cage
coach Joe Lyles.

Coach Lyles attributed the suc-
cess to simply “hard work and team
play.” The frosh boss pointed that
the freshman success is even more
impressive considering the loss of
two starters, Jack Fisher and How-
ard Gordy, after the first semester
due to grades.

“They realized that they had to
work and they did,” the coach con-
tinued, “and the main portion of
success comes from the team’s carry-
over of 100 per cent hustle from
practice to games.”

Lyles cited Frank Morrison, with
a 19.3 scoring average for the twelve
game season, Mike Saunders, Dave
Ogilvie, Roy Powell, and Marc
Winston for their play throughout
the season. The Baby Generals’
mentor added that Francis Jones
also did a fine job as number six
man on the squad with his heads-
up play.

“This was one of the finest fresh-
man teams I’ve ever coached,” said
Lyles, and he remarked that he was
looking forward to seeing them on
the varsity next year.

Coach Lyles Cites Catching As Problem

Baseball Outlook Bright

By TOM CARPENTER

The success of Washington and Lee’s baseball team appears to hinge
on one position, catching. Give the Generals a solid defensive catcher,
and they should win a few games this season.

The Generals lost four of last year’s starters, two unexpectedly. Third
baseman and captain Chuck Lane and shortstop Buck Rose graduated, but
the loss of outfielders Eric Sisler and Bob Taylor came as an unexpected
blow to Coach Joe Lyles’ plans for this season. Taylor supplied many a
clutch hit last year and was the Generals’ best defensive outfielder.
Sisler was the leading hitter with an average over .400. He also was the
College Athletic Conference All-Star leftfielder.

The pitching looks pretty solid with star lefthanders Chris Wigert and
Brice Gamber returning. Coach Lyles would like another righthander.
Mason McGown, the number one righthander last season, was lost early
with a bad shoulder, and Lyles is uncertain as of yet if the shoulder has
healed. Other possibilities are catcher Deug Davis and versatile Lou
Paterno. Five rookies will also be hoping for hill spots. Roy Powell, lanky
righthander, appears to be the best prospect. He has poise and is a control
pitcher. Others are Terry Herman, Jim Cooper, Pete Heumanns, and soph-
omore Scott Lavery.

The number one catcher from last year is Davis, although he can ex-
pect competition from Tom Crenshaw, and freshman Ward Briggs. Heu-
manns is another possibility. Lyles admits that he will be willing to sac-
rifice hitting for a good defensive catcher.

The infield has two assured starters, but where they will play is the
question. Lou Flanagan, a co-captain with Gamber, will be at second or

Score Tied After Five Events;
W&L Loses On Close Matches

CHASE

Tuesday Sports Writer
Traveling to Charlottesville, the wrestling Generals of
Coach Dick Miller wanted nothing more than a victory over

f the first five matches the score

stood at 8-8, but winning only one of the final three heavier
ok

weights gave the wrestlers the short
end of a 16-13 result and a final
6-5-1 seasonal record.

The match began with Butch
West having to settle for a 3-3
tie after a disputed decision for
stalling in the crucial third period.
Then Dick Musick shut out his
opposing Wahoos, 5-0, to give W&L
a 5-2 lead.

In the “match we needed to
win,” as Coach Miller said, Kem
White saw his near pin in the first
period go for naught as his com-
petition squeezed out a 7-6 win on
the one point given for riding time.

Prospects brightened, though as

_| Jamie Andrew, in the 147 pound

class, taking over for ineligible Tom
Stover, beat his opponent, 4-2, in
a close, come from behind, victory.

Winfield Wrestles Wells

In the most exciting match of
the evening, Pete Winfield tangled
with his arch foe and acting Vir-
ginia captain Alex Wells. With re-
verses dominating the first two
periods, Winfield was behind, 8-4.
However, Winfield, in fine shape,
came back with 5 points and al-
most a pin in the third period.
Unable to hold down his larger op-
ponent, Winfield fell victim to an
escape coupled with riding time
that spelled his defeat, 11-8.

With the match now tied, Gen-
eral captain Herb Smith saw his
first two period advantage vanish
in the final third period when Cary
Stewart, bother of W&L’s Warren
Stewart, used a reverse and near
pin to take a 7-4 decision.

third, and Paterno will be at first, third, or short. John Lackey is a veteran
who can play first base, as is Howie Martin, but Martin is probably going
to pass up playing this season. Dave Kirkpatrick could work his way into
the third base or shotstop jobs. He is fast and handles his glove well.
Cooper is a third base prospect, while Mike Saunders may find his way
into one of the starting positions.

The outfield has been depleted by player losses. Besides Taylor and
Sisler it seems that Dick Brown has decided to play this season, That
leaves only three veterans, Pete Candler, Ashley Allen, and Jim Crothers.
Crothers also plays first, and Allen may not be able to help the team
because of labs, which will cause him to miss practice quite frequently.
Wigert, who led the team in RBI’s last year while playing in more than
half of the games, will probably play in the outfield against righthanded
pitchers when he is not pitching. Freshman Gene Gillespie stands a good
chance to win a spot in this undermanned position.

Coach Lyles summed up his needs which he seems to think are many,
in one sentence. He is looking for a catcher, a third baseman, a shortstop,
and two outfielders. He also wants another right handed pitcher.

Lyles also seems upset at the fact that the team must play seven games
in eight days on the Spring Trip. He hopes to have his pitching staff ready
by then.

He also commented that anyone who is interested in a tryout may still
come out. The team will work out in the gym from 4 to 6 p.m. Monday
through Friday until he feels that they are ready to go out onto the field.
As of now, there are only 25 men on the roster.

Mr. MeDowell’s father is a Pro-
fessor of Law at W&L, and Mr.
McDowell himself is a graduate of
W&L. He attended W&L imme-
diately following the close of World
War II, and in his freshman year
began writing for The Columns, the
W&L newspaper at that time. His
sophomore year, he became editor
of this publication. When the Ring-
tum Phi came back into existence
his junior year, he wrote a column
on this publication also. This same

 

year, he worked on the Calyx staff,
was an Executive Committee mem-
ber, and wrote for the Southern
Collegian. Mr. McDowell, in his sen-
ior year was elected president of
the Publication Board. He was also
a member of the Washington and
Lee Literary Society, and of the Edi-
torial Board.

After attending Columbia School
of Journalism, Mr. McDowell joined
the Times Dispatch as a reporter
and in 1956, he was given a column.
As a reporter, he toured the country
with Khrushchev and also covered
the national political conventions.

Mr. McDowell’s talk is being joint-
ly sponsored by Colonel Gilliam of
VMI, and Dr. Colvin of W&L, under
the auspices of the NCEP, the Na-
tional Committee for Education in
Politics. This is a nonpartisan or-
ganization supported by a Ford
Foundation grant, the purpose of
which is to interest students in
practical polities.

Mr. McDowell was scheduled to
speak at W&L last November 25,
but because of the President’s as-
sassination his lecture was postponed.

Debaters Lose
In Navy Meet

The Washington and Lee Debate
Team suffered defeat last week
at the Annapolis Tournament, spon-
sored by the U.S. Naval Academy.
The team composed of sophomore
Sam Frazier and freshman Bill
Grant won victories over the Uni-
versity of Maryland and St. Joseph’s
while losing to the universities of
Georgia and South Carolina, St.
John’s, and Eastern Nazarine.

The Annapolis Tournament is
the 13th this year for the Debate
Team. Forty-one students have
participated in these tournaments
this year, and 40-50 more have
taken part in practice dual de-
bates with other Virginia colleges,
marking the greatest number of
W&L students to participate in
forensic activities in recent years.

 

There are about four more tour-
naments remaining this school year.
Today Ed Fitzgerald, John McMurry,
Alan Cohen, and Tabor Novak left
for the Georgetown Invitational
Tournament in Washington.

Despite the losing record suffered
by the team in its tournament last
wekend, Director of Forensics Wil-
liam C. Chaffin pointed out, the
debate team is enjoying another
winning season.

In addition to a successful over-
all average, the debaters have won
several meets outright, as well as
earning a number of individual
awards. The record is especially
bright in consideration of the fact
that many freshmen were used.

Sam Goldwyn
Talks At WGL,
Shows New Film

By SYDNEY LEWIS

University of Virginia graduate
Samuel Goldwyn, Jr., and Cavalier
English professor, Dr. Garret spoke
before a movie-going Washington
and Lee audience Thursday night.

Goldwyn, son of ithe famous direc-
tor-producer, Samuel Goldwyn, Sr.,
started his career as a producer of
documentary films for NATO; how-
ever, in recent years he has followed

film, The Young Lovers, was shown
at the State Theatre late Thursday
night.

Goldwyn’s lecture centered around
his new film which is a love episode
involving college students.
wyn stated that in this movie he

a responsible person, not the usual
beatnik, pervert, or  lackadasical
person he is usually depicted as.
Moreover, Goldwyn mentioned that
he tried to distinguish the difference
between love and sex in his new
cinema.

Goldwyn revealed that the movie
is based on a poor novel adapted
for the screen by Dr. Garrett, and
its theme, that “love cannot totally
exist without self commitment,” re-
mains the underlying theme of the
movie. The novel was unacceptable
in its original version because of its
lack of action and poor dramatiza-
tion. However, Garrett, whom Gold-
wyn first became acquainted with
after reading his book, King on the
Mountain, was able to convert the
book into workable flick.

Goldwyn said that his major prob-
lem after beginning to rewrite the
novel was to find acceptable actors
to portray the characters. After see-
ing Peter Fonda in a movie in New
York, Fonda was signed; however,
the role of the lover opposite Fonda
presented a more formidable prob-
lem and finally an unknown star
was caste.

After the lecture, Goldwyn ac-
cepted questions from the audience.
In his answers he stated such facts
that even an inexpensive movie
costs around $750,000, and also tried
to explain the difference between
American and European color in
films.

Also, he was questioned on the
function of a producer and explained
that a movie to him was like a book
to an author and that he must be
absolute manager of the film to feel
that he has produced a work of his
own.

This morning, Goldwyn spoke at
the 9:20 Journalism course, “An In-
troduction ‘to the Motion Picture.”
The class was essentially a question
and answer session with the topic
of discussion being The Young
Lovers.

National Science Foundation Grants

12-Inch Reflecting Telescope To Physics

By TOM DAVIS

Last year two money grants were
made to the Washington and Lee
University Department of Physics
to provide new laboratory equip-
ment,

A grant of $15,000 from the Atomic
Energy Commission has enabled the
Physics Department to purchase
radio-active isotopes and _ several
laboratory instruments used in radi-
ation experiments. The new equip-
ment is now being used by students
enrolled in Nuelear Physics 212, a
course that is new this year to the
curriculum,

In addition to instruments that de-
tect and count atomic emissions, the
Nuclear Physics Lab is equiped with
a neutron accelerator called a Neu-
tron Howitzer. The Neutron How-
itzer is used to radio-activate thin
strips of metal foil which are needed
in radiation experiments. It con-
sists of a large tank of water in the
center of which is placed a core of
radioactive material; this radioactive
source emits neutrons traveling at
high speeds.

The neutrons must be slowed
down in order for them to activate
the metal foils. For that reason the
neutrons are directed through the
water which tends to retard their

speed. In some experiments the
Howitzer operator may wish to di-
rect a beam of fast moving neu-
trons in which case he adjusts the
instrument so that the neutrons are
projected through an empty tublar
channel instead of through water.

Mr. William Barlow Newbolt, a
graduate of Berea College in Ken-
tucky and instructor of Nuclear
Physics 212, says that careful pre-
cautions must be taken in the lab-
oratory to guard oneself against
harmful radiation. The laboratory
is equipped with blocks of lead
which are used to sheild the obser-
ver from his experiment.

A generous grant frora the Na-
tional Science Foundation has en-
abled the Physics Department to
purchase a twelve inch Newtonian-
Cassegrain reflecting telescope.

In October the telescope was in-
stalled under the astro-dome on
top of the New Science Building.
Dr. Edward Turner, Professor of
Physics who teaches the astronomy
courses at W&L, Physics 202, says
that the new telescope replaces a
five inch reflector made by a former
proefssor here.

The old scope was cumbersome
and had no permanent mounting.
When it was used it had to be car-

 

ried by two men through an open
window onto the roof of Reid Hall
where it was placed upon a tripoid.
The new twelve inch reflector has a
permanent equatorial mounting.

The telescope is driven by a mor-
tor on the mounting so that it com-
pensates for apparent star movement
and keeps an observed object with-
in it field view at all times. The
New Science Buidlding observatory
is also equipped with two refractor
finder scopes which are used to
locate objects for the main scope,
and a guide telescope which is used
to keep the ‘twelve inch reflector ac-
curately on target when lengthy
time photographs are being taken
through it.

Now on display in the New Sci-
ence Building is a series of photo-
graphs showing several stages in
the lunar eclipse of last December.
Dr. Turner used the twelve inch
reflector to take the photographs.

It is important when making as-
tronomical observations to note the
accurate time of one’s observations.
Dr. Turner reports that the Physics
Department will soon install a short
wave radio to receive time signals
from station WWV in Washington,
D.C., and will also install a pendulum
clock to check time measurements.

Application For 1964
Records New High

By HARRY KUHNER

The Committee of Aidmissions is
now in the process of considering
for acceptance the largest number
of freshman applications ever sub-
mitted.

As of February 15, reported Dean
James Farrar, 1450 completed ap-
plications had been submitted, ap-
proximately 200 more than last year.
Dean Farrar also stated that be-
tween 550 and 600 will be offered ac-
ceptances for the 330-member fresh-
man class and that notification of
acceptance will be sent out starting
now, and continuing through the
spring until the deadline for the
candidate’s reply date, May 1. No
potential freshman is required to
inform the University of his ac-
ceptance until that time.

According to Dean Lewis John,
Director of Financial Aid, approx-
imately 250 of the 1450 applicants
have asked for financial assistance.
Of this 250, 120 have already been
offered acceptances. Dean John
stated, however, that not all of these
will need financial aid.

Dean John said that Scholarship
Weekend will determine the recipi-
ents of the Robert E. Lee and George
F. Baker scholarships. About 30
semi-finalists for these scholarships
will be interviewed on March 20
and 21 by two separate committees.
The Faculty Committee on Schol-
arships will interview all applicants
on Friday, March 20, and the fol-
lowing day, a three-man committee
from the Board of Trustees will in-
terview the semi-finalists for the
Baker scholarships. The finalists for
the Baker scholarships will be
chosen directly by this committee,
but the Lee scholarship finalists will
be determined by the Faculty Com-
mittee on the basis of these inter-
views.

The group of potential freshmen is
felt to be an extremely strong one
in respect to qualifications. Dean
Farrar feels that this is due to the
fact that college guidance in the

inations for this year’s recipient of

bution to the University in an ex-
tracurricular activity.

no later than March 23,

NATIONAL DEFENSE GRANTS

The new booklet containing a
listing of National Defense Grad-
uate Fellowships for 1964-65 is
now available for consultation
in Dean Pusey’s office. Students
interested in obtaining a doctorate
for an academic career of teach-
ing at higher institutions are giv-
en preference.

The Fellowships, which are com-
petitive, are available in such
fields as English, foreign lan-
guages, philosophy, area studies,
economics, history, political sci-
ence, sociology, psychology, natur-
al sciences, and mathematics.

high and preparatory schools has
been improving so as to persuade the
prospective freshman to apply to a
school suitable to his capacity as a
student. He also stressed the point
that the competition is becoming
keener.

He feels that there are two phases
of this competition: first, the student
that applies to W&L has, on the
average, applied to three other col-
leges; and second, the University
itself is striving to seek a degree of
excellence which forces its appli-
cants to be better prepared for col-
lege. This competition, coupled with
the fact that the number of college
applications is increasing each year,
will provide a better academic en-
vironment at W&L in the years to
come, he stated.

Richmond Editor
To Speak Here.

James Kilpatrick, editor of the
Richmond News Leader, will speak
at Washington and Lee under the
sponsorship of the Department of
Journalism on March 18 at 8 p.m.
in duPont Auditorium.

He will concern himself with po-
tential problems of the next twenty
or thirty years brought about by
governmental policies and the pop-
ulation explosion, conservative pol-
icies, responsibility, and principles
applying to the problems of change.

Recently, he has discussed racial
problems and his views on them
with CORE director James Farmer,
and on television, with Negro rights
leader Martin Luther King.

On this campus his arguments
have been both attacked and sup-
ported in the Ring-tum Phi through
letters, editorials, and articles. He
is noted for his representation of
the segregationalist South, and his
opposition to Federal intervention in
state affairs.

Kilpatrick was born in Oklahoma
City in 1920, attended both elemen-
tary and high school there, and gra-
duated from the University of Min-
nesota in 1941 with a Bachelor of
Journalism degree.

In the same year he began work-
ing for the News Leader, covering
State and Federal courts and offices.
In 1949, under Dr. Douglass South-
all Freeman, Kilpatrick became asso-
ciate editor of the News Leader, and
in June of the same year he be-
came editor upon Freeman’s retire-
ment.

He has been honored by the Uni-
versity of Missouri for distinguished
service in Journalism, as a_ result
of an editorial campaign to release
a Negro mistakenly convicted and
sentenced to life for murder.

For an editorial campaign in sup-
port of the doctrine of interposition,
the honorary journalism fraternity
Sigma Delta Chi awarded him its
annual prize for distinguished edi-
torial writing in 1956. In 1955-56

The appointment of six vice pres-
idents for Spring Dances was an-
nounced today by Steve Smith,
president of the dance set. It was
also announced that Dr. Feelgood
and the Interns will appear at the
Springs Cocktail Party which will
open the weekend on Friday, April
Lf,

The vice presidents, all juniors,
are Andy Carothers, Walter Bennett,
Brooks Brown, Bill Price, Jim Slay,
and Duke Terrell.

Carothers, an SAE, is vice presi-
dent of publicity for the dance set.
He is vice president of his fraternity
and a member of the Mongolian
Minks, WSCF, and the Advisory
Council.

Bennett is a Sigma Nu and will be

4in charge of the figure. He is a

Dean’s List student, Robert E. Lee
Research Scholar, chairman of the
Massachusetts delegation for the
Mock Convention, and is a member
of the Library Committee.

Brown, a Kappa Sig, will handle
the cocktail party. He is vice pres-
ident of his fraternity, secretary of
the junior class, secretary of the
International Relations Club, and a
member o fthe Dance Board Ad-
visory Committee. Brown also was
sophomore class secretary, Out-
standing Freshman his first year,
and played varsity baseball.

Price, an SAE, is vice president
in charge of invitations to the dance
set. He is a member of the “Thir-
teen” Club, the Student Service So-
ciety, and the varsity lacrosse team.

Slay is a Delt and will handle
decorations in the gym for the week-
end. President of his fraternity, as
well as of the House Managers’
Association, Slay is also a member
of the Cold Check Committee, the
Dance Board Advisory Committee,
and the lacrosse team.

Terrell, KA, is vice president in
charge of coordination of the var-
ious phases of the dance set. He is
house manager-treasurer of his fra-
ternity, played varsity soccer, and
holds a McElwee Grant Scholarship.

Smith also stated that last year’s
format for the Spring weekend
would be used again. Last year, for
the first time, the old formula of a
dance and a concert was replaced by
two concerts, both held in Doremus
Gym.

The dates of the two concerts are
April 17 and 18. Both concerts are
expected to be held in the evening.
Music for the two nights will in-
clude jazz and rock and roll, ac-
cording to the Springs president.

The cocktail party will be an out-
side affair, but the location is un-
determined as yet. In case of rain
the Moose Lodge will be the alter-
nate location of the cocktail party.

Dr. Feelgood and the Interns, who
will entertain at the cocktail party,
have been one of the most popular
groups at Washington and Lee for
several years and have established
a national reputation for their hit
records as well as for their campus
appearances.

Assimilation Committee
Defines Policy on Dress

In order to clarify several mis-
conceptions of what is and what is
not conventional dress, the Assimi-
lation Committee publishes the fol-
lowing guidelines, which are elect-
ed examples and certainly not all
inclusive ones.

Conventional dress includes: Sport
or suit coats and ties, slacks, W&L
monogram cardigans, shirts of sub-
dued colors, sweaters and vests, pro-
vided coats and ties are still worn.

Conventional dress does not in-
clude: Sport shirts, such as madras

.or plaid, sneakers, jeans of any
color, winter coats (overcoats, ski
parkas, ete.) in place of sport or
sult coats.

Inasmuch as the above are only
guidelines, the decision of what con-
stitutes conventional dress, or, per-

haps a better term, dress befitting
a gentleman, and when it should be
worn, can sensibly be left only to

judgment of the Assimilation

Student Lashes Out At Flournoy’s ‘Humorous’ Letter

I just want to congratulate Dan

Sexual Revolution—Part Ill

 

Flaws Cited In ‘Playboy’ Sex Philosophy

In the true style of Ellery Queen
and Alfred Hitchcock, we have
embodied our third and final “epi-
sode” with a bit of a surprise
ending. The position we are taking
in our concluding remarks below
are in direct contradistinction to
the sand which our first two in-
stallments presented. Our policy
so far has been to affirm to the
readers at large exactly what they
wanted to hear; thus, the “free
love” philosophy and the Playboy
credo have been merely a subter-
fuge to attract attention to a per-
tinent and critical issue. Having
enticed the herd with this sugar-
coated surface, we now, however,
shall disclose some of the bitter
realities about our topic sex.

By KEN LANE
Editor-in-Chief

In its demogogic manner , the
Playboy philosophy of Hugh Hefner
eee , and disciples has
m | challenged college

students to bring
|| the subject of sex
', unabashedly _ into
the open. It has
done so by ridi-
culing the absurd
extremes to which
conservative fac-
‘tions such as the
church have gone
in their effort to
suppress anything
at all associated with sexual be-
havior. On tthe other hand, these
philosophers have followed up their
iconoclasm by jumping to an oppo-
site and equally perverted extreme—
that of dissolving sex taboos alto-
gether.

Lane

The Playboy credo is not neces-
sarily antimoral; to the contrary, it
in many ways fills a gap that the
ivory tower moralist has overlooked.
For it directs society not to con-
form to morality merely for the sake
of morality or for fear of public
censure, but to be open-minded and
free-thinking. It rebels against out-
dated social rules and sentiments
which limit our freedom ‘to be in-
diivduals. It challenges us to look
beyond mores and folkways, em-
ploying the question “Why?” as a
tool for deeper probing.

Where Playboy poses its great-
est threat is not in its antimoral-
ism, but in its antisexuality. Com-
menting on this flaw, critic Harvey
Cox in the journal Christianity
and Crises, states that Playboy
and its imitators “dilute and dis-

sipate authentic sexuality by re-
ducing it to an accessory, by keep-
ing at a safe distance....We must
see in Playboy the latest and
slickest episode in man’s continu-
ing refusal to be fully human,”
For in its “idealism” toward sex,
the Playboy philosophy has run into

several fallacies. First of all, in much |

the same way that we have done in

our previous installments, Hefner
is projecting in his philosophy intel-
lectual arguments in support of what
the masses want to hear, and this in
large part explains the basis of his
popularity. In a society of perfect,
rational persons, the freedom Hef-
ner advocates is plausible. But there
is a difference between using free-
dom to lead better lives and free-
dom to justify the life one wants to
lead, and men commonly and con-
veniently confuse this distinction.

 

Secondly, by its emphasis on
spontaneity as opposed to self-re-
straint, the Playboy philosophy as-
sumes a precarious foundation. If
we make every decision in favor of
our natural inclinations, this would
mean going to the movies or tzavel-
ing “down the road” whenever the
impulse hits us. As rational indivi-
duals, we inevitably confront sit-
uations that demand self-control, our
self-denial of the “natural,” the
spontaneous, for what will in the

 

end mean more to us. If we didn’t
act this way, we would not be free;
we would be slaves to our every
whim and desire.

Would repression of our sex
drive lead to frustration and per-
version? The psychologist says no.
By a process called sublimation,
our sex-derived energies can be
constructively channeled in aven-
ues other than physical expression.
There are any number of gen-

Student’s Inquiry Clears Doctor’s Name

By N. E. Personne

A few days ago, it was my mis-
fortune to overhear some malcontent
refer to our beloved campus physi-
cian as a “quack vetenarian.” As be-
fitting any high-minded man and
citizen, I was outraged and indig-
nant at this insidious insult to the
professional felicity of our noble
doctor, this paragon of medical
knowledge, this tireless worker who
has never once been known to ab-
sent himself from the environs of
the school infirmary. My patriotic
duty as a gentleman and scholar
called—I immediately began an in-
vestigation to clear forever any
shadow of disrepute surrounding the
name of our learned doctor. The
results, manifestedly successful, are
recorded below.

Faith Confirmed

I was first granted the honor of
an audience with the great man
himself. Entering the physician’s of-
fice, I was ushered into his presence
after a wait of only five hours. The

 

doctor was enshrined between an
ornately carved and painted mask
and some rattles on one side, and a
great boiling cauldron on the other.
On the desk before the throne were
two learned medical treatises: Golf
Made Easy and How to Succeed in
Business Without Really Trying.

The kindly doctor was gracious
enough to immediately confirm my
unwavering belief that he is in-
deed one of the world’s foremost
authorities in the medical profes-
sion. With this unimpeachable
first-hand testimony, there was
obviously no need for further en-
quiry, but knowing the depraved
opinions of many so-called stu-
dents at W&L, I persisted.

The doctor was so kind as to
show me his renowned preventative
and cure for all diseases known to
man or beast—Prof. Barnum’s Pe-
troleum Snake Oil. Right on the
label of this wonderful bottle of es-
sence was authoritatively listed just
a few of the ailments instantly

 

cured by the contents: poison ivy,
the common cold, hypochondria, hy-

drophobia, diarrhea, pneumonia,
constipation, measles, hoof and
mouth disease, tapeworms, and

housemaid’s knee.

To forever shatter the malignant
rumor that he is a graduate of the
third-rate Abbsynia Institute of
Medicine, the physician showed me
his diploma from the Mount Zion
School of Pharmaceutics and Faith
Healing.

Mental Acuteness Revealed

Our school physician’s great psy-
chological acuteness in ferreting out
hypochondriacs was brilliantly dem-
onstrated the other day. Another
student, obviously of a deceitful and
sneaky character, informed the doc-
tor that he had lost twenty pounds
in two week, and that he had a med-
ical history of critical kidney dis-
orders. Immediately penetrating this
disgraceful sham, the great healer
exposed the student for trying to

Impressions Of Student Body Expressed By Dr. Duvall

Editor’s note: The following article by
Dr. Severn P. C. Duvall is based on a
speech he gave before a meeting of the
Lynchburg alumni on February 19.

As for our students—I find them on the
average a very good lot, well up the scale of
ability even if our college board scores show
us to be below the level of our
peer institutions northeast and
midwest. In my own area of
} competence I have found their
work — their themes—to be
generally as good as those of
freshmen elsewhere. I gave no
more A’s before than I do
here and about the same per-
centage of C’s. I am delighted
to find myself back in a re-
spected and operative honor system embraced
by the students and run by them. I am pleased
also by their manners, by their engaging
friendliness, and by their responsiveness in
personal contact. I think I have never known,
personally, as many undergraduates as I know
here after only two years, and these associa-
tions are invariably satisfying.

   

Duvall

Yet I have other responses which are
somewhat more critical. They come from the
accumulated experience of two years only, a
fact which may diminish their reliability. But
take them for what they are; they too are im-
pressions.

Homogeneous Student Body

I find the undergraduate body too homo-

geneous, too bland—not a real beatnik in the
lot, no leaven to the mass. I suspect our un-
dergraduates do not easily tolerate, let alone
encourage, a cellist or a poet, a fact inevitably
reaching outward to determine our admissions
profile. Individuality is expressed chiefly in
its social outburst. I find them, from my per-
spective, too conservative. | do not mean this
in its political sense (though the distinctively
conservative bias to their political remarks
may be a factor in the larger view) but in its
intellectual sense. They seem to be, for ex-
ample, lecture-oriented, surely able to repeat
on examination the data fed into them from
textbook and podium. What I miss is the clash
of their opinions, among themselves and with
their instructors. College is their chance, prob-
ably their first and perhaps their last, to test
the radical possibilities of life.

Radical Nature of Youth To Be Expected

Youth is radical by nature—it should be
radical. We older folks timidly watch and
worry at its outbreak in various phases: inde-
pendence in finances, the discoveries of sex
and liquor. We should rather remember the
currents of life, and channel these currents
productively. Where is a better place, when
is a better time, for the plunge into the world’s
body? When and where better to challenge
the world, to boast to the world of one’s self?
Here they may confront undiluted and pure
the concepts on which their physical and cul-
tural lives depend; here they may meet with
men of varying age who, ever young in the

degree of their own continuing challenge, treat
with them as equal selves to explore and dis-
cover. For this reason I sometimes wonder if
we as faculty do not abdicate our true respon-
sibility by standing as we sometimes seem to
so closely in loco parentis—though I suppose
this is a role thrust upon us by some parents
who perhaps conceive of the liberal arts col-
lege as a ‘finishing’ school rather than a “be-
ginning.”

I want my students at W&L to be aware
of the values of the alien world, to grasp the
being of otherness as well as the values of
self. I believe they must confront the world
as individuals, self-dependent, not fraternity—
or family—or tradition-bound to respond in
ways others have prepared and trampled for
them. I want them to face the perils, the risks
of freedom with alert, self-dependent minds
disciplined by their contact with the broad ex-
perience available to them in college. In
talking as an English professor now, for I
mean the broad experience given man in his
literature and history and philosophy. But I
would insist also on the discoveries of the
laboratory as equally releasing. And if I seem
here to contradict myself, if you argue that
such experience must be seen as itself an ac-
cumulated and traditional body of knowl-
edge, I would simply reply to the contrary
that even this is reevaluated from age to age—
provisional at best—for each age must ques-
tion its received traditions in its own present
terms, from its own peculiar perspective. And
those who seem best to survive that question,

in literature at least, are those like Shakes-
peare who represent the world as it is in its
fullest complexity and ambiguity, where ab-
solutes are always shadowed by time.

Responsibility Is in Part To Subvert

As an English teacher I naturally play
with words; remember this when I say that
I feel my responsibility is in part to subvert
or currupt your sons, in the sense of breaking
up the set and inherited ways for reexamina-
tion; and all we can offer them in return are
provisional possibilities. As educators we lead
them out—out of what? Out of the embraces
of protective devices which left unexamined
will inevitably strangle them. We offer them
liberation in a liberal arts college.

And what is our ultimate role—ours,
meaning both mine and yours? We must ac-
cept and encourage their plunge, their dis-
coveries, even at the risk of losing them—ac-
cept it with pride to the ultimate end of their
grace.

Rewards Come Even From the Worst

One is always rewarded as a teacher even
by the worst students I suppose, for one shares
in each discovery. What a life-giving sense it
brings! Always the pride of seeing the mind
make its own break upward and out. In a free
theme from my freshmen last semester I re-
member two impressive examples (neither of
which, I should note, took their immediate
departure from reading assignments in the

In Review

 

Winter Sports Turn in
Poor Seasonal Record

By GUY UNANGST
Friday Sports Editor
All in all, winter sports were pretty much of a flop.
In basketball, wrestling, swimming and rifle, Washington
and Lee’s varsity teams compiled an ignominious 16-30-2 rec-

ord. None were able to win

more than half their games,

 

matches, meets, or what-have you.*

Perhaps the brightest spot during
the long winter was the performance
of coach Joe Lyles’ freshman basket-
ball team. Lyles regards it as one
of the finest he has coached.

The freshmen finished with a 9-3
mark, winning four of their last five
games. The defeat was 84-76 to
Greenbrier Military, in a game
which the freshmen fouled enough
to give their opponents 56 free
throws.

These last five games the team
was without two first semester
starters, Jack Fisher and Howard
Gordy, who had a bit of grade
trouble. Frank Morrison was a
freshman spark plug, averaging 19.3
points a game.

Wrestlers Dissapoint

Along about November, everyone
(well, almost everyone) was talking
about how the wrestling team was
the best ever, might go undefeated
and might (Ye Gads) beat Virginia.
The wrestlers ended up 6-5-1.

Well, they did win half their
matches. and vaunted freshman Dick
Musick did win most of his matches

Halfway through the season, Tom
Stover, one of next’s year’s tri-
captains, had a little bit of grade
trouble (or a whole lot depending
on how you look at it) and was
replaced by Jamie Andrews.

Stover has an overall record of
22-4, Andrews proceeded to win but
two of six matches.

Wrestling fans should console
themselves with the Generals’ 40-0
victory over RPI, and their 37-0
rout of Hampden-Sydney. Oh, inci-
dentally, they didn’t beat Virginia.

Swimmers Split

The W&L swimming team, or
“mermen,” as one edition puts it,
managed to break even, winning
five of their 10 meets.

Coach Norris Eastman said one
week he would be “relying heavily
on nine returning lettermen,” and
then, after Virginia (them again)
beat W&L 62-33, had to blame it
on a “young team.”

The Tuesday Edition (let's come
right out and say it this time) pre-
dicted a winning season for the
swimmers in part two of their
series—“Who to Watch this Winter.”
It’s interesting to note they then
gave up the series.

Their best performance was prob-
ably earlier in the season, in a 49-
46 win over Loyola (Baltimore).
The “mermen” set school records
in the 500 yard freestyle (John
Wolfe), the backstroke (Bill Broad-
dus), the medley relay, and free-
style relay.

Eastman called his medley relay

 

team “his best ever.” They lowered
the old team record eight seconds.
Bart Taylor, Broaddus, John Lifter
and Bill Wildrick compose it.

Basketball Too

At the beginning of the season
coach Bob McHenry said height
would be his basketball team’s big-
gest problem. For more than half
the season the team rebounded as
well as their opponents, but then
height caught up with them.

In the Roanoke game, for instance,
the Generals took but one rebound
off the offensive board in the entire
first half.

McHenry Leaves
Rich Career Here

By BRUCE GARRETT
Friday Sports Writer

When basketball and__ lacrosse
coach Bob McHenry leaves here
at the end of this year, Washington
and Lee will lose a very active par-
ticipant in the sports world.

Moving to Lebanon Valley, where
he will coach the same two sports,
McHenry has been particularly not-
able in his lacrosse achievements.

A 1956 graduate of Washington
and Lee, he played basketball here
for four years and lacrosse during
his last two.

In his senior year he was selected
for honorable mention on the All-
State basketball squad. He also play-
ed on the Southern team in the
North-South All-Star lacrosse game
in Geneva, N. Y. The South won
20-10.

In 1960 he was assistant coach
for the Southern All-Star team
which won 13-12, and in 1961
moved up to head coach, bringing
home a 12-9 victory.

During the summer he joins Coach
Dana Swan and Bob Frost playing
in the major division of the Phila-
delphia Lacrosse club, as close to
professional lacrosse as there is.

When asked about his forthcom-
ing change of tenure, he remarked
that since his brother is currently
coaching at Lebanon Valley and the
school is close to his home, it seemed
an ideal choice when ‘the job of
backetball coach fell vacant.

“Not that the administration and
coaching staff have not been won-
derful to me here,” he is quick to
add, “but I feel the need of a
move, and it is easier to do when
you are still young and single.”

McHenry had no ready explana-
tion as to his interest in two so dif-
ferent sports as lacrosse and basket-
ball, but said lacrosse had probably
been kinder to him. He has been
around the world from England to
Australia and Hawaii with touring
lacrosse squads.

Even though lacrosse has given
him more honors and advantages
than basketball, his major interest
depends on which season he happens
to be in.

It is sincerely hoped the adminis-
tration can select a man able to fill
the vacant post as competently as
has McHenry over the past six years.

 

Bridge Clubs Meet Twice Weekly

By PATTON ADAMS
Friday Sports Writer

For Washington and Lee students
who have aspirations to be another
Charles Goren, the American Con-
tract Bridge Association provides
the perfect opportunity.

Under its auspices duplicate
bridge—the bridge you play for
points instead of money—is offered
from 8 p.m. to midnight each Tues-
day and Friday at the home of Mrs.
L. E. White, 2101 Forest Avenue,
Buena Vista.

The student fee is a nominal
twenty-five cents, except for “Mas-
ter Point Nights,’ when the rate
increases to fifty cents. These are
held the second Tuesday and fourth
Friday of each month.

Two Clubs

Organized in 1957, the club orig-
inally met on Tuesday nights only
but, as interest increased, another
charter was secured to establish the
Friday club. Today the Tuesday club
is known as the Rockbridge Dupli-
cate bridge club and the Friday or-
ganization is called simply the Fri-
day Evening Bridge club.

Mrs. White in an interview stress-
ed that both clubs are “open,” and
that students are welcome to come
either or both nights whenever they
wish.

Usually four to six tables are
played, but Mrs. White hopes to in-
crease the size to eight or ten so
that more Master points can be

awarded. Currently both clubs play
under the Hoyle duplicate method
which awards the winner a fraction
of a Master point, determined by a
formula involving the number of
tables played.

There must be at least three and
one-half tables for anyone to score
Master points, according to the rules
of the American contract Bridge As-
sociation. If six tables are played the
winner receives .30 point. If, on the
other hand, only five tables are
played, the winner receives .25 point.
Second place receives half the
amount of first place, and _ third
place one-third.

Life Masters

A number of Life Masters from
Lynchburg often play in Buena Vis-
ta. To become a Life Master one
must have 300 registered Master
points. Mrs. White has 150.

Several members of ‘the club also
hold good tournament records, Mrs.
White explained. The competition
is, thus, quite rugged.

When asked for a tip to playing,
Mrs. White replied, “The most im-
portant thing for the duplicate
bridge player is to try to figure out
what everybody else has in his
hand.”

IM WEEK

By TOM WHITE
Friday Sports Writer

KA stands today as intramural
wrestling champion for 1963-64. With
only one more tournament match
to be held, it looks as if Sigma Chi
will take second, DU third, and Beta
fourth.

KA picked up the title by virtue
of a 3-0 record. They opened with
a 26-10 victory over Sigma Chi,
and followed up with a 25-12 win
over DU. Then, last night, they
clinched the top spot by overwhelm-
ing Beta, 23-5.

Sigma Chi needs only a victory
in their match Monday with
Beta to clinch the number two po-
sition. While if Beta should win,
there would be a three-way tie for
second place.

In the other tournament matches
held, it was this way:

DU over Beta, 20-11; and Sigma Chi
over DU, 25-15.
* He *

In handball, the mess created by
the three-way tie between KA, Beta,
and Delt has yet to be unscrambled.
In the only game played during
the past week, KA rebounded from
their earlier tournament loss to Beta
and came up the winner.

Still left on the KA _ schedule:
Delt, whom KA defeated earlier in
the tournament competition, 4-1. A
KA victory here would give them
the title, while a Delt win would
probably assure them of the top
spot.

In bowling, tournament action got
underway this past week, with Kap-
pa Sig and Phi Kap coming up the
winners in the opening round.

Kappa Sig took advantage of Tom
Pace’s 203 to topple SAE, 2508-
2288. Phi Kap had a slightly easier
time of it as they defeated Phi Psi,
2374-1815.

Giving the Phi Kap cause a big
boost were Jim Bussart and Bill
Tedards who bowled identical
202 games in the third set.

Next week’s action will find Kap-
pa Sig favored to beat Phi Psi, and

SAE rated a toss up against Phi Kap.

Lacrosse ‘B’

Squad Begins

Thirty candidates for “B” squad
lacrosse appeared Tuesday night at
an arganizational meeting called by
coach Dana Swan.

Swan said he was pleased with
the turn-out but would welcome
any others who wished to play. The
team will play four games this year,
opening April 16 against Augusta
Military.

Most of those signing up for the
team have not had previous lacrosse
experience, but Swan pointed to
the varsity’s co-captains Syd Butler
and Johnny McDaniel, both of whom
learned the sport while playing for
the “B” squad. McDaniel is a strong
candidate for All-American honors
this year.

The team finished last season with
a 3-3 record. The full schedule:
April 16, at A.M.A.; April 24, Wood-
berry Forest; April 30, Virginia
freshmen; May 6 A.M.A.

One change has been made in the
varsity schedule announced last Fri-
day. The site of the May 14 game
against Virginia has been changed
from Lexington to Charlottesville.

 

Interviews Continue

As Twombly Seeks Coach

Two men have been interviewed
concerning coach Bob McHenry’s
vacated job as basketball and la-
crosse coach.

Athletic director E. P. “Cy” Twom-
bly said the interviews were con-
tinuing. He declined to divulge the
candidates’ names.

The athletic committee will inter-
view a number of men concerning
the job before making any decision.
Twombly said tthey are primarily
interested in finding a_ basketball
coach. He said the lacrosse vacancy
could probably be filled within the
department.

McHenry filed his resignation, ef-
fective at the end of the school year,
several weeks ago.

 

Rifle Closes Season 1-7-1

Stifled by snow clogged roads,
the Washington and Lee rifle team
was unable to compete in last
wekend’s National Rifle Association
sectionals at Fort Lee. The team
closed its season with a 1-7-1 record.

The 1963-64 ROTC rifle team rib-
bon was presented to 11 shooters.
Captain Dick Coplan won his third
award, Harold Head and Bob Ken-
nedy their second.

Coach Jim McSheffrey had felt
the team could win third place in
the N.R.A. meet, behind VMI and
Virginia Tech.

 

Mets Make It Difficult

By ASSOCIATED PRESS
The New York Mets, known for
doing things the hard way, came up
with an unusual method of getting
a batter out in an exhibition game

the other day against the Detroit |

Tigers.

The Tiger batter popped high to-
wards first base, but Mets first base-
man Bill Hass missed the ball. Third
baseman Wilbur Huckle came over,
grabbed the ball and fired to second
baseman Larry Burright, who was
covering first. Burright tagged the
baserunner, who had taken a wide
turn. It was a first to third to sec-
ond out.

= _ ==
by Tim OKeefe

If the coaching staff's recommen-
dations for the proposed gym ma-
terialize, Washington and Lee will
really have something of which to
be proud.

I wasn’t too enthused when plans
for anew gym were announced sev-
eral weeks ago.
As soon as I heard
of them, I imme-
diately thought of
one thing we need
more—a good stu-
dent union.

But it seems the
coaches took this
into consideration
when they drew
up _ their _iist.
They’re planning a
combination gym
and student union. What they have
come up with sounds terrific.

(Before reading any farther, re-
member their recommendations
must be approved by the board of

Tiny Tim

trustees. And then there is_ the
small matter of money).
First, there would be eight

bowling alleys, several pool and
billiard tables and a_ concession
area. Also included would be six
handball and six squash courts,
a rifle range, a basketball court
seating 2,500-3,000, a much larger
swimming pool and an asphalt
practice area.

Athletic Director E. P. “Cy”
Twombly said the gym would be
as functional as possible. “We can
turn the six squash courts into
handball courts any time. The as-
phalt area could be used for tennis,
lacrosse or track any time of the
year—we would no longer be limited
by the weather.”

W&L certainly can use the 12
handball courts. Ideally, they would
be on floor level. Part of the back
partition would be of glass so inter-
ested persons could watch.

The swimming pool would be 25
yards wide—quite an improvement
when you consider the present pool
is not quite 24 yards long.

The athletic department would be
self-sustaining with the new gym.
No longer would we have to use
the VMI riflle range or the town’s
bowling alley.

Twombly believes the new facili-
ties would act as an incentive to
students and faculty. “When they
see the new equipment they will
just naturally want to use it. There
should be something for everyone.”

What are the chances of these
plans being accepted by the board
of trustees? Twombly naturally
would not give a positive answer
to the question,

His comment was, it doesn’t hurt
to try to go first class.”

Maybe the day of miracles hasn’t
passed after all.

THE RING-TUM PHI

Rewarding Discoveries Even Among C Students

(Continued from page 2)

course). One was the essay of a southern boy
who came to grips with the issues of segrega-
tion. I wish I could say he revised his attitudes,
but I can’t. Yet the paper revealed remarkable
honesty and candor, for he recognized in him-
self inherited prejudices for what they were
and in struggling todeal with them against op-
posing arguments admitted the logical futili-
ty and inhumanity of his position.

The Student Confronts a New World

The other student projected his growing
awareness of significant shifts in the patterns
of social relationship and dependency—speci-
fically, the shift from vertical structures, typi-

and taste. Both

of life? Since

fied by the family wherein generations are
closely tied against the outside world, to a hor-
izontal plane of peers who have dissolved their
ties to the past and prefer the unity of time

men were confronting a world

out of tune with regional beliefs but both
faced their own conclusions.

What are these but particular examples of
the crucial fact of human awareness:
knowledge of good and evil, the tragic sense

the

by God’s will we must leave,

we should leave the Eden of our childhood

a sense of loss,

bravely and with purpose. Inevitably we face

a fear of the future: these are

human conditions. But if our students face
them with courage, flexibility, and grace, we
will have done the utmost education can do.

 

Lane Criticizes Playboy Philosophy

(Continued from page 2)

iuses who have found creativity
independent of an active “sex”
life. Among these are artists such
as Da Vinci and Michelangelo;
writers such as Shakespeare and
Hugo; humanists such as St. Paul
and Schweitzer; philosophers such
as Kierkegaard and Emerson.

Thirdly, the Playboy philosophy
tends inadvertenly to exert a de-
humanizing influence on interper-
sonal relationships. Under the guise
of “enlightened self-interest,” it
presents a rationalization for crude
egotism. The ideal “playboy” is tthe
skilled consumer, the man of dis-
criminating taste and polish, with
the savoir-faire to drain from the

 

reservoir of experience the most

gratifying pleasures. The result, ex-
plains Unitarian minister John A.
Crane, is a “universe for rather ele-
gant and refined consumers, and
girls are the grandest of all con-
sumer goods. A girl is something
like a sports car or a bottle of Scotch
or an Ivy League suit, that is meant
to be used and enjoyed by men.”
Hence, the Playboy aura threatens
to impersonalize sex. The accent of
the new ideal is on detachment and
non-involvement; the playboy stud
revolves through life in a constel-
lation all his own. The only sex he
knows is a relationship not between
persons but between egos, each seek-
ing gratification from the other.
Sex and tthe sex partner are mere
commodities in the marketplace of
life; as the skilled consumer, the
connoisseur of pleasure, the play-

escape exams and sent him packing.
Though another doctor discovered a
few days later that the student had
mononucleosis , there is still no
doubt that the student was faking—
probably by not eating for two
weeks. What lengths the vicious-
natured will go to, just to confound
the virtuous.

Finally, there is the case of the
man who was involved in a bad
car wreck, He was suffering some
pain, and went to the infirmary
where he was pronounced to be
in perfect health. Despite this sa-
gacious judgment of the school
physician, the student spitefully
insisted on being in pain, and went
so far as to be examined in Roa-
noke, where he was found to have
a brain concussion. Now some
might say that this case is an
adverse reflection on the com-
petency of our school doctor. Not
at all. Could you or I, merely
by looking at the victim, tell if
he had a brain concussion or not?
Of course not! How then, could we
expect the school doctor to see
something that even we ourselves
can’t tell?!

I certainly hope that this expose
of the machinations of our school
doctor’s imbecilic critics will help
reaffirm our universal faith and
respect for him. The position of
Doctor of Medicine entails a much
greater amount of responsibility,

Someone’s Trying To Dig Hazry’s Grave.

 

 

Randy Wootton

, KEN McGRAW
ae News Editor

Hairy’s grave is being dug. A res-
olution to withdraw University sup-
port from the Southern Collegian,
which would leave the popular pub-
lication $1200 in the red next year,
is presently before the Executive
Committee and will be acted on
shortly. The action was initiated by
Dean of Students, Edward C. At-
wood in response to alleged numer-
ous complaints from parents, alumni,
student’s dates and students.

At present, approximately one-
third of the money used to pub-
lish the Collegian comes from the
Student Activities Fee required of
all students. This is in accordance
with the constitution of the Univer-
sity which lists the Collegian as one
of the campus publications which is
to receive a part of ‘this fee.

The pending resolution is for an

 

,amendment to this constitution
which would remove the Collegian
from this list. Such action would
require a majority vote by the en-
tire student body if the E.C. ap-
proves the resolution and a two-
thirds vote if it does not. With or
without the E.C.’s approval, how-
ever, there is good reason to be-
lieve that students will be voting on
this matter sometime this spring.

Atwood’s Letter

In a letter to E.C. Chairman, Bill
Noell, Dean Atwood outlined his
opinion of the Southern Collegian.
He stated in the letter that over
the past few years he has been
asked repeatedly to justify the Uni-
versity’s sanction and financial sup-
port of the Collegian. He has found
justification impossible for this mag-
azine which serves no educational
purpose. He further points out that
“each issue is edited on a panic

 

basis and that the contents include |
materials of an off-color nature of-
ten bordering on obscenity.

Dean Attwood has made it clear,
however, that he is not seeking to
abolish the Collegian and that his
letter to the E.C. does not include
any such proposal. He has said that
he would not be against its publi-
cation as an independent student
enterprise, and his only reason for
initiating the proposed action was
that he could find no logical justifi-
eation for the use of the University’s
name in such a magazine.

Student Protest

Three weeks ago Randy Wootton,
Phi Delt senior, went before the
Publications Board with a_ similar
proposal which was independent of
the administration’s resolution. He
stated that, as a humor magazine for
the students alone, the Collegian

 

had a definite place on this campus.

Yet the Collegian is not restricted
to this campus alone but is “random-
ly distributed to whomever might
pick one up,” and thus it has a po-
tential readership much greater than
the student body.

The kind of humor enjoyed by
the majority of Wé&L students is, he
feels, offensive to a portion of its
readers who include some of the
parents of the girls who have come
here, students’ parents, and the
faculty.

The fact that the Collegian is a
sanctioned publication of the Uni-
versity reflects badly, he said on
the students here and on the admin-
istrative heads who not only sanc-
tion, but also support the Collegian’s
publication. Wootton made clear in
an interview yesterday, however,
that he is not trying to start a Puri-
tan campaign to clean up the Col-

tive or imaginative: short stories,
critical studies, one-act or longer
plays, or informal essays. An ade-
quate bibliography and footnotes
must accompany criticism.

For a prose entry, a minimum of
1500 words is required. A collection
of shorter selections can be submit-
ted to total the minimum number of
words.

Poetry entries must consist of a
minimum of approximately 30 lines

Goldwyn Talk
Offers Little

To Listeners

A Review
By TOM PACE

Sam Goldwyn, Jr., the son of a
more famous father, was at Wash-
ington and Lee last week to deliver
a lecture. Along with him came: a
print of his latest film, “The Young
Lovers,” which was shown at a
sneak preview on Thursday night
before a representative group of
freeloading students and seemingly
eager, interested townspople and
faculty; and a short, nearly bald,
witty professor of English from the
University of Virginia who had
self-admittedly, penned the screen-
play for the movie.

 

Goldwyn’s lecture offered lit-
tle that most did not already
know, but he appeared both hon-
est and sincere which made one
look hopefully toward his movie—
in vain. He wanted, so he said, to
tell, honestly, a story of the prob-
lems which faced normal, solid,
stable youths in college today.
Yet he and his writer, George
Garret, managed to riddle the plot

GOP Primaries
May Result In
Surprise Ending

Condensed from an article by
J. BRUCE WHELIHAN
The final tally of the vote in

the New Hampshire presidential
preference primary may have more

‘| effect on the five announced Re-

publican presidential hopefuls than
political observers believe.

A heavy write-in vote is expect-
ed for Ambassador Henry Cabot
Lodge and Richard M. Nixon, who
have refused to declare themselves
candidates.

Nixon and Lodge

Nixon said that he would accept

a draft at the Republican National
cceuaiiies which will be held in
July in San Francisco. Sources close
to Ambassador Lodge, who is cur-
rently in South Viet Nam, say that
he will announce his candidacy soon.

According to a recent survey, the
Ambassador is the third most popu-
lar candidate with Republican vot-
ers in the Granite State. Senator
Barry Goldwater and Governor
Nelson Rockefeller are holding
down the number one and two
spots.

Advance in Lodge Popularity

An advance in Lodge popularity
has bene particularly noticeable in
the past week. During the same
period, Nixon’s popularity also has

climbed, but he has fallen into
fourth place.
Rockefeller and Goldwater have

both declined in popularity in the
past two weeks. Statistics indicate
that Rockefeller lost more support
than Goldwater.

A strong showing today in the
number of write-ins for Lodge
would indicate that an as yet unan-
nounced candidate might easily
walk off with the Republican party
nomination. This assumption will
seem even more valid if Goldwater
and Rockefeller register near the
same number of votes.

Delegates attending Washington
and Lee’s Mock Convention will
have only the final results of the
New Hampshire and _ Illinois pri-
maries to guide them. Only Senators
Goldwater and Smith are regis-
tered for the April 14 preference
poll in the Prairie State.

The Indiana and District of Co-
lumbia primaries will be held May
5, the second day of the Mock Con-
vention, too late to influence ballot-
ing.

 

*play April 17 from 8 to 10 p.m. in

Doremus Gymnasium.

Brubeck’s world travels under the
auspices of the State Department
have carried jazz, “the American
export,” to the far corners of the
world as a symbol of American free-
dom. Appearing on the cover of
Time magazine and featured in num-
erous musical publications, Brubeck
has a universal appeal.

A look at the list of Brubeck’s
recordings makes apparent the ver-
satility of his talent. In addition to
regular albums of standard jazz
tunes, there are such original al-
bums as “Time Out” and tthe latest,
“Time Changes” which are remov-
ed from the usual jazz style.

Each member of the Dave Brubeck
Quartet has won individual recog-
nition and is a soloist in his own
right. Paul Desmond, alto sax, Joe
Morello, drums, and Eugene Wright,
bass, combined with the piano of
Brubeck, create the distinctive style
characterized by the New York
Times as “the beat heard ’round the
world.”

As an important influence in mod-
ern jazz, Brubeck’s theory of con-
temporary jazz appeared in the mag-
azine section of the New York Times
following his extensive tour abroad.
Speaking of his reception in Europe,
Brubeck states: “There is no mis-
taking its effect; it arouses a kin-
ship among peoples; it affords them
flashes of recognition of common or-
igins, because of its basic relation-
ship to folk idioms. It is grasped by
the naive and the sophisticated alike.

A typical Brubeck concert is rela-
tively sedate and sophisticated, of-
fering a wide variety of musie within
Brubeck’s frame work. He offers
each one of the musicians in his
quartet an opportunity to prove his
adeptness. Ed Croft, president of
the Dance Board, has commented
that the contrast between Brubeck’s
Friday night coneert and the rock-
and-roll show scheduled for Satur-

day night, should make for plenty
of variety in the weekend.

Che King-tum Phi

Tuesday Edition
Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

The Mock Convention

Of all the mock conventions held by various colleges
across the country, W&L’s is one of the most respected.
This respect stems from the fact that through the years,
the leaders of our conventions have made certain that
when the balloting begins, it is based not on the emotion
of the moment or the personal preferences of the students
in a particular delegation, but on the actual political in-
clination of each state.

 

And so, we pride ourselves in the authenticity
of our convention—it is a record won by sincere
leadership and a lot of plain, hard work—but it
wouldn’t take many lackadaisical state delegation
chairmen to ruin it. Unless every one of these stu-
dents makes every possible effort to assess the po-
litical bent of his states, the balloting will possibly
turn into a complete farce.

Tonight New Hampshire will give us the first real
milestone in the GOP candidates’ campaign. It won’t tell
us everything, but we should learn something about the
actual force of Goldwater’s appeal, the campaign power
of Governor Rockefeller, and the potential discontent
with both these men, as shown by write-ins for Nixon and
Lodge.

State delegation chairmen must do more than read
newspapers and watch Huntley-Brinkley, though; let-
ters should be written to W&L alumni in all states, asking
for both financial support and their political judgment.
Chairmen of key states in particular must contact every
known Republican leader in their states to ask his opinion.

To make the problem even more difficult, it
is likely that the political attitudes of many of the
50 states will be fluctuating between now and
May. It will be dangerous and inaccurate, in some
cases, to vote in May on the basis of information
compiled in March. Thus, there must be contact
with key men in all states right up until the con-
vention, and then during the balloting itself.

The 1964 Mock Convention may be up against the
greatest challenge to authenticity ever faced by one of our
conventions—the professionals themselves can’t tell just
how the wind is blowing. Because of the uncertainty of
many states’ positions, the responsibility of the members
of the Steering Committee, the delegation chairmen, and
indeed, of every student, is to do everything possible to
be sure that our balloting in May reflects the genuine
attitude of the nation at that particular time.

 

Current Cinema

Entertainment Is Praised
In ‘Love With Stranger’

By BOB SCHAEFFER

Among the current reel-romances with titillating titles, “Love
with the Proper Stranger” succeeds in spite of itself because its
lurid subject matter supplies enough warmth and humor to over-
come a fairly pedestrian plot. This romantic comedy-drama com-
bines producer Alan J. Pakula and director Robert Mulligan, (the
“To Kill a Mockingbird” team) and these two seasoned toilers trans-
form a tenement melo-drama into an unlikely but pleasing fairy
tale.

 

Natalie Wood and Steve McQueen Featured
The princess is Natalie Wood, actually a salesgirl at Macy’s and
the prince-proper stranger is Steve McQueen, a struggling, some-
time musician who also isn’t ready to make love any more than
a sometime thing. Fortunately for the fairy godmother both are
from Italian-immigrant backgrounds, but unfortunately they meet
and experiment during a weekend in the Catskills.

After this one fall from grace our heroine finds herself in a
motherly way. They meet again—this time in Rocky’s (McQueen)
union hall and not just by chance. “I’m gonna have a baby,” Angie
(Wood) announces. “Congratulations,” offers Rocky. He agrees to
help her find a doctor, is rejected by his lady-in-waiting, Edie
Adams, and begins a pursuit which eventually winds up, naturally,
with love.

Abortion Attempted

During this chase we encounter the wicked witch, a despicable
midwife who is on hand to aid the abortionist in an almost suc-
sessful attempt to rid poor Angie of her malady. But this near act of
barbarian chicancery causes Rocky to rebel, and he agrees to marry
the lady in distress. Angie balks, insists she will marry only for love,
isolates herself from Rocky in an ivory tower, and proceeds to find
the right husband. Eventually Macy’s becomes the battlefield,
Chivalry and love conquer all and prince and princess unite before
a throng of peasants on the drawbridge to West thirty-fourth Street.
And since all’s well that ends well, presumably they lived happily
ever after.

“Love with the Proper Stranger,” like so many recent Hollywood
movies, is accentuated with a theme song, one of cinema’s more
regrettable habits. This particular tune plays precariously right in
the middle of a tender scene, which makes for an episode of more
nonsense.

But there are more than enough humorous incidents. Tom Bos-
ley, Angie’s sincere but extremely awkward suitor, provokes wit
upon whimsey, for every glimpse of Natalie sends him into cumber-
some, accident-prone traumas. Edie Adams co-stars sufficiently
and enhances the dialogue tremendously. “You’re a sex mainiac,”
she purrs promiscuously as McQueen ogles her thigh. And McQueen,
after fixing an intent eye on Natalie’s decolletage, passes up the
chance for love making the way most people pass up dessert.

Talent of Actors Evident

The real essence of “Love with the Proper Stranger” is Wood and
McQueen. These two pros, starring together for the first time, carry
the film through several slow spots with their superb talent. Besides,
they are very interesting people to watch.

The fact that New York City is the homefront and sole area

(Continued on page 4)

  

  

Disregarding Time magazine’s cos-
mopolitan tradition of never really
enjoying anything (be it book, movie,
or play), I must confess I really
liked the Troubadour’s presentation
of Marlowe’s Dr. Faustus.,

The play represents the struggle
of the learned, worldly Elizabethan
man to break with the sterile, intel-
lectual traditions of the Middle Ages.
Faustus, who has mastered all
learning, is not able to control his
ambition, and in his passion for
knowledge and power sells his
soul to the devil for twenty-four
years he squanders his powers on
erude jokes and women. Near the
end he realizes his mistake and
wants to repent, but it is too late,
and Faustus is trundled off to fire
and brimstone. The tragedy lies in
the fact that he is not damned be-
cause of a basically wicked soul but
because of his excessive Renaissance
infatuation with man’s potentiality.

Morton Shines

Tim Morton, playing Faustus,
brought a true feeling for the part.
Most distinguishing in his perform-
ance were his stage presence and
impeccable diction. Morton evident-
ly understood the self-confidence
and impetuosity inherent in his
role and quite obviously had the
ability and experience to bring it off
well. His lines dragged a little to-
wards the middle of the play but he

more than recovered by the last
scene. The “But One Bare Hour”
soliloquy was superb; good enough
to scare hell out of old Lucifer him-
self.

Playing against Morton in the role
of Mephistopheles was Steve Colvin.
Here Director Cecil Jones picked
another good man. Mephistopheles is
Satan’s right-hand man who _ has
the trying job of keeping Faustus
happy during his twenty-four year
spree. Colvin has both the mencing
voice and piercing eyes for the part,
and showed the uncanny ability to
create as much of an atmosphere by
merely being present on the stage—
silent and watching—than by say-
ing anything.

Hilarious Entertainment

The comic interludes between ser-
ious scenes (with a few exceptions)
came off very well. Lock Handley
as Robin and Lew Davis as Ralph
went together like Mutt and Jeff.
The audience enjoyed Handley’s
slap-stick facial expressions im-
mensely. Jeff Williams did a com-
petent job as Wagner, the hypocrite
servant of Faustus and Joe Volpe
managed some especially farsical
scenes as the horse dealer.

Although he only appeared in two
minor roles, it is unconceivable to
overlook the performance of Dr.
Keith Shillington. “Doc” was hilar-
ious as the fifth deadly sin, glut-
tony, despite obvious type casting.

There were of course, less compe-
tent performances, but nothing bad
or important enough in this cate-
gory to injure the play as a whole.
It is always a problem with Eliza-
bethan tragidies, and _ especially
Faustus, to coordinate the comic
scenes with the more central tragic
scenes. This remained somewhat of
a problem in the Troub production.

Sandra Dee in Disguise

Both director Jones and_ stage
manager Don Lineback deserve con-
gratulations for the stage layout and
props. The prop design was striking
and versatile. This important as-
pect is often neglected in the college
theater. Costumes were generally
suitable and—heaven forbid—actual-
ly looked like they had not been
used more than five times before.
The briefs under the devil’s cos-
tumes were conspicuously obvious,
but c’est la vie. The paramour of
Alexander the Great was another
Ursula Andress and Helen of Troy
had to have been Sandra Dee in dis-
guise.

It was interesting to note that
Latin mentor, Herman Taylor had
been called in to keep the “e’s”
hard and the “v’s” soft. He did a
good job.

In conclusion it was a highly en-
enjoyable production, well worth
both time and money spent. Fine
acting in the leading parts and able
direction made the difference.

 

Political Horizons

U.S. Seeks

By WYATT DURRETTE, JR.
Political Columnist

Many critics of the Administra-
tion’s foreign policy accuse it of in-
consistency, vac-
illation, and even,
in some cases, of
lacking a cohes-
ive, purposeful
strategy.

It is my sugges-
tion that this is
not the case; that
we have a stra-
tegy—a _ _ strategy
of detente born of
the “new epoch”
in the U.S.-Soviet
relations following the Cuban missle
crisis of October 1962.

Scholarly journals have recently
carried many articles dealing with
this subject. For instance, in an
article published in the Columbia
University Forum, Fall 1963, Dr.
Zbigniew Brzazinski wrote that, “if
the quiescent phrase endures, the
Soviet Union may eventually opt out
of the revolutionary game.... [It]
is therefore incumbent upon the
United States to adopt a posture of
peaceful engagement in order to

 

 

promote change in the Communist
world.”

Although Dr. Brzezincki recog-
nizes that “the Soviets remain
committed to the ideological war,”
and that the U.S. must maintain
its “military superiority,” and re-
main aware “of the dangers inher-
ent in the test ban,” he argues vig-
orously of “peaceful engagement.”

Specifically, he proposes that we
“invite a group of Russian officials
to sessions of Congress and pro-
pose in return that a body of Amer-
ican legislators sit in a session of
the Supreme Soviet.” We might
also, he suggests, organize a “youth
festival in America, and invite many
thousands of Russians to it.”

Although these suggestions are
unorthodox, the theme of the article
expresses, I believe, the tenor of
U.S. policy. I offer in my support
excerpts from a column in The New
York Times by foreign affairs colum-
nist C. L. Sulsberger, entitled,
“How Superpowers Seek Peace”:
“Without doubt, despite grave dif-
ferences between Washington and
Moscow on flamboyant issues, Amer-
ican opinion is being deliberately

Peace — Deliberately!

cultivated by a deliberate American
government.... To produce the
gradual change required for Amer-
ican acceptance of any major accord,
it is necessary to influence news.
That may be cynical; but it is true
and inferentially desirable.”

Suggesting that Washington and
Moscow “have warily embared on
unilateral but related moves to en-
courage ‘trust by mutual example,”
Mr. Sulzberger supports his conten-
tion with the following:

“Khrushchev made reduction of
defense budgets a _ precondition
for disarmament. McNamara sub-
sequently predicted ours would
‘level off and perhaps decline,’
citing Soviet flabbiness. President
Johnson cut the budget. On the
day this was revealed, the C.LA.
said Russia was an _ economic
swamp that, by inference, couldn't
spend more to defend itself.

“Khrushchev responded by prom-
ising to slice his military budget
and perhaps reduce force levels. Mr.
Johnson proclaimed a 25 per cent
cut-back in enriched uranium pro-
duction for warheads. A few days

The Revolution Of ’63

 

The Core of the Segregationists’ Creed:
Negroes Belong To The Inferior Breed

Editor’s Note: This is the second
in a series of articles by Dr. Louis
W. Hodges. The series was origi-
nally published in more complete
form by the Waynesboro News-
Virginian.

By LOUIS W. HODGES

The heart and core to the segrega-
tionist’s argument is now and has
always been the
racial myth, the
- assumption that
the Negro is in-
_ ferior because he
is a Negro. The
myth is a simple
one. It claims that
the Negro does
not reach as high
a level of achieve-
i » ment as the white

~ ‘because the Ne-
oe, nage gro belongs to an
inferior race. The Negro is thought
to be made of inferior stuff biolog-
ically speaking.

It is a fact, of course, in our cul-
ture that the general socio-economic
level of the Negro is below that of
the white. Per 1,000 population, for
example, the Negro bears more ille-
gitimate children than does the
white; he has a higher rate of illit-
eracy; he has a greater frequency of
physical deformity; he earns a low-

 

er per capita income. The racial
myth concludes that these facts are
explained by the simple truth that
the Negro is made of inferior mater-
ial.

Lack of Opportunity

Social scientists, however, have
long since explained the fact of
low attainment in terms not of bi-
ology but of the lack of opportuni-
ty by the Negro. For example, the
white has assumed that the Negro
is incapable of holding the higher
paying jobs and has thus excluded
him from them; he has assumed
that the Negro is not fully educable
and thus has not allowed equal
schools. The Negro’s inferiority,
claim social scientists, is thus not
that he is biologically lower but
that he has not been allowed oppor-
tunity to develop

But the logic of the social scientsit
does little, if anything, to remove the
racial myth. The follower of the
myth is ordinarily not adept at log-
ic anyway, and is surely not inclined
to be convinced by mere rationality.
The myth is in a state of decay for
other logical reasons. It goes like
this: More and more fields are be-
ing opened to the Negro; he is in-
creasingly being allowed to develop
his latent talents without artificial
hindrance from his society,

The result has been that he has
come to excel: Willie Mays in ath-
letics, Marian Anderson in the arts,
Ralph Bunche in government....
When dealt with as an individual
and not as a “Nigger” the black man
has shown competence at all levels
of our society, on the business end
of a broom as behind the execu-
tive’s desk.

Success of the Negro

The myth is being weakened by
the very success of the Negro. The
myth is being undermined not
through logic—though logie too
works against it—but through the
emotions, in subconscious rather
than conscious ways. Subtle and al-
most unconscious changes are effect-
ed in baseball-loving racist, for ex-
ample, when he admires the skill
of a Negro player.

This movement tends to “snow-
ball” and to gain momentum. The
more the Negro is allowed to enter
competitively into new fields, the
more pressure there is to open oth-
ers. So it is that the racial myth is
dying a natural, if reluctant, death.
The sophisticated have long recog-
nized the flaws in the myth; the un-
sophisticated are being pulled un-
consciously toward that recognition.
This too is part of the “Revolution
of 63.”

EC Meetings
Should Be Open
To Students

By LAMAR LAMB

Since I have been at Washington
and Lee, every year there has been
some discussion of a reorganization
of our student government with
an eye toward splitting the powers
of the Executive Committee. Some
have suggested creating a Student
Senate. The principle argument
against the present system is that
the EC, because of its quasi-secret
nature, is unable to adequately ful-
fill both the legislative and judicial
functions that it now has.

I have been unable to determine
whether this criticism is justified.
From my experience I have seen
that members of the EC are gen-
uinely concerned with fulfilling all
their duties with foresight and fair-
ness. And, I think it must be agreed,
the decisions so far have been rela-
tively good and just. Of course, there
have been mistakes, but any govern-
ing body is going to make mistakes.

What I have seen that disturbs
me is that, because the multiple
functions of the EC, members have
a certain isolation from their class-
mates. Many times, the EC has
had to make decisions without suf-
ficient reference to what the student
body at large thinks. There are sev-
eral reasons for this. One, I suppose,
is that fact that even the most con-
scientious Executive Committeeman
cannot assert student opinion be-
yond a superficial level.

Student Apathy

Another, more important, reason
is an apparent lack of interest on
the students’ part in the EC’s func-
tion. In my two years on the EC,
there have been very few students
who approached me about issues we
were discussing, partly because of
an understandable apathy, and part-
ly because of a hesitancy to discuss
the EC at all with its members. The
judicial function and its necessary
secrecy has isolated the EC from
student opinion on other matters.

When members of the EC do ask
other students what they think
should be done in certain legisla-
tive matters, they can ask only a
limited number of a few acquaint-
ances. Even in a school as small as
Washington and Lee, it is not hard
to see that this severely restricts the
possibility of a truly representative
government.

‘Structural Weakness’

The problem, then, can be seen to
be one of a certain in structural
weakness— the ignorance of the stu-

Letters

To The
Editor...

An Answer to Flournoy

Dear Editor:

The letter to the editor by Dan
Flournoy in the Friday edition of
the Ring-tum Phi does not neces-
sarily reflect the faculty or student
body’s views on integration. How-
ever as editor you are responsible
to your public.

The use of the press should never
be misused to misinform the public
or to formulate public opinions. It
is difficult to conceive that in the
age of modern missiles and efforts
of man to inhabit the moon that we
still have elements of this same so-
ciety living in the dark ages.

I have always thought of Wash-
ington and Lee as a cultural and
educational center, but if these opin-
ions of a student reflect attitudes
of your student body and faculty,
then Washington and Lee hag lost
its purpose as a light in the world
for the unlearned to become learned
men, and to teach that human dig-
nity is a just right of all people re-
gardless of race, creed, and religion.

 

 

 

 

The following points are answers
to Dan Flournoy’s ten point pro-
gram,

1, Negroes are not as anxious to
enter Washington and Lee as you
fear they are. There are many high-
er ranking universities that will ac-
cept them.

2. Negroes are familiar with your
“system” and also with fraternity
and combo parties. I should like to
introduce you to the Alpha Phi Al-
pha Fraternity.

3. I doubt if these choice Negroes
would want to date the neighbor-
ing girls. This relationship should
be kept to individual taste.

4. I think Washington and Lee
students should wear be-bop hats
and pegged pants because they
would certainly look better that way
than some I have seen parading up

Part I—WGL’s Forgotten Sports

 

Many Factors Attributed To Poo

As promised, this Tuesday’s Sports page takes great
pleasure in presenting Washington and Lee’s greatest un-
sung sport, pool, and the top billiard players in the Univer-
sity. This group of dedicated, courageous and hard-work-
ing young “gentlemen” carries on a centuries old sporting
tradition by maintaining a W&L Varsity Pool Team. After
weeks of research and work, the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
presents PART I—Unsung Sports. All Photos by Bill Young

By JIM CROTHERS
Tuesday Sports Editor

For the last thirty-seven years, the Washington and Lee
varsity pocket-billiards team has gone through many brilliant
seasons, yet has gone virtually unnoticed and unpublicized
because of the 1927 faculty decision that recognition of a
pool team would destroy the “gentlemen-like” image of the
College. However, this team has been so sucecssful of late,
winning 38 consecutive team matches against the toughest
competition throughout the nation (Southern California,
Stanford, Miami, Slippery Rock, etc.) that the Tuesday sports
staff has decided to lift the censorship and feature the W&L
pool team.

This illustrious group, braving TB, (which is greatly en-
hanced by the smoke and chalk-filled ‘‘arenas” of competition)
broken thumbs and sabotaged cue-sticks has traveled many
miles week after week to further the University’s name at its
own expense (in competition, of course). In two years the
General sticksters have lost only two individual matches, both
as a result of underhandedness by the team’s opponents.

 

“Daddy Warbucks,” Louisiana Beatle,” and “Midget Wrestler, three bil-
liard team seniors sharpen their eyes for upcoming pool match.

Modestly self-acclaimed as the “‘greatest straight-pool play-
er at W&L” Hobby “Louisiana Beatle’? Morrison leads the
team as a co-captain and the leading money-winner. This KA
senior has been known to sink many unbelievable shots—those
others admittedly would not even attempt. The master of the
trick shot and his famed three-rail ‘“‘Leroy” shot, Morrison has
been acclaimed by the experts as ‘“‘the man to beat” in straight
pool.

Second to Morrison only in straight pool, Mac ‘Daddy
Warbucks’’ McNeace, is known primarily for his nine-ball and
one pocket play. As the other Co-captain of the W&L pool
squad, McNeace is known by his teammates as the expert
tactician and has been credited with winning matches with
both his cue-stick and his mouth. This shooter could, it has
been said, psyche out the Mona Lisa if she happened to have
a roll,

Tom “Cornbread Red” Corse is the most consistent mem-
ber of the team and, as a sophomore, has two more glorious
years on the team. The opposition is warned to beware of
Corse—he is one of those silent, uncomplaining types, yet
is known to be a mite sneaky, (often “forgets” to mark up

eye of both Jimmy Caras and Walter Clark, and this year

Herb ‘“‘Midget Wrestler” Smith is the most violent member
of the five-man team. Smith has been known to take out his
frustrations, when and if behind in a match, on the “arena’s”
windows. Somewhat flashy, this blonde senior often carries his

Hubbard, another senior member of the fivesome. “Ace”’ has
the position of “most valuable” on the team because of his
ability to win with either end of the cue-stick (particularly
during speedy exits). Hubbard is the master at “‘accidentially”

his devastating “Stoneface’’ stare to overcome his rival.

in Lexington. The team’s sponsors, instructors, cheerleaders,
and most avid fans are Mr. Walter Clark and his son, Dick.
Without these two W&L pool would have died-out many
years ago; and the members of the team indicated that they
base much of the squad’s success on the generosity and good-
ness of these two men .

A typical “artist of the
green cloth” has several very
essential qualities which pre-
pare him for competition. He
has an easy schedule enabling
him to practice at least six
hours a day; he has the “‘gift
of gab”; he cannot and will
not be “psyched-out’”; and,
finally, he must be either crude
and vulgar or sauve—depend-
ing on the competition. Team
members must also possess
amazing concentration which
will enable to device
new shots during even the
most interesting classes, and
all team members share the
same contempt for the “nov-
ices’ who horde the tables at

Lamb Advises Open EC Meetings

dent body as to just what the EC
is doing, and an inability of the var-
ious members of the EC to take a
poll on issues which confront them.
This is not necessarily catastrophic,
but at times it is unhealthy.

Since at times there is no practi-
cal remedy of the latter situation
(else we would have a Greek polis
and not a representative govern-
ment) perhaps something can be
done about the former.

In short, there is no reason why
legislative sessions of the EC should
not be open to all students. Two
years ago, these meetings were open-
ed to the members of the press, but
they have only sporadically sent re-
porters to the meetings. Students
still have very little idea of either
what the EC does or how well it
does it.

Matters of Interest

I have no illusions as how well at-
tended these meetings would be—
very few students would come. But

 

there are a few occasions when ser-
ious matters are being debated, and
it is at these times when both the
EC and the student body would
benefit from open meetings. People
interested in such things as the var-
ious committees’ functions, the prog-
ress of the Mock Convention, or
student body fund allocation would
greatly profit from attendance at
EC meetings. When debate on such
matters is scheduled, students could
be notified of time, so they could

come, observe, and perhaps con-
tribute from the floor.
This should in no way, however,

interfere with the secrecy of honor
trials, for obvious reasons. But there
is no reason why legislative meet-
ings should not be open to any stu-
dent who is interested in coming.
If nothing else it would help them
in knowing whom to vote for in
Spring elections—they would be
more thoroughly acquainted with
both issues and abilities and opin-
ions of members of the EC.

strategic parity would serve as a

supremacy.”
Different policy goals must

inevitably be the products of these
divergent analyses. The goal of those
who share the first and in whose
breast “hope springs eternal” is to
seek a workable relationship be-
tween communism and the free
world that will preserve peace in
a “world safe for diversity.”

Contrast the goal proceeding
from the second—victory over
communism through concerted po-
litical, economic, psychological, and
subversive efforts. A global stategy
designed to diminish the Soviet
power base and challenge com-
munist aggressions on all fronts.
To these men peace without vic-
tory is a dangerous illusion,

It is in this context that the spe-
cific proposals, or lack of them,
from aspirants for public office
from both parties take on meaning
and must be understood.

Editor Defends Collegian

The attempt to remove the school’s
support from the Collegian, however,
is expected to be unpopular with
the student body. Collegian editor,
Tain Tompkins, who, as a member
of the Publications Board, has been
aware for some time of the endang-
ered position in which the Collegian
has been put, spoke up in favor of
the publication when interviewed
yesterday.

Tompkins admitted that Dean At-
wood’s criticisms were excellent and
that Wootton had a point, but said,
“I wouldn’t undertake to edit it if
I didn’t think it was worth defend-
ing.’ He stated that he could not
disagree with some of the criticisms
but was strongly opposed to this
action which would possibly mean
the end of the Collegian.

To bring an end to the Collegian,
he said, would be bringing to an
end the most popular of the campus
publications. He pointed out that
the Collegian ranks as one of the
oldest and most famous college hu-
mor magazines, and despite present
events, is enthusiastically accepted
by the substantial majority of stu-
dents,

it a sanction to collect as it does

kins, a test of popularity.

At his lecture, someone asked Mr.
Goldwyn who was responsible for
the photography in his picture. He
said, in effect, that the final re-
sponsibility was his, but that often
such decisions were left to tthe di-
rector of photography. As the pho-
tography was really the only nice
thing about the film I feel quite
safe in assuming the credit for this
goes to the director of photography
and not to Mr. Goldwyn. Despite
his unusually good intentions, the
feeling that one has on leaving the

film is that Mr. Goldwyn lacks
imagination, talent, and insight. As
for Mr. Garrett, he should be
ashamed.

William H. Peterson, distinguished author and business book editor of
the Wall Street Journal, will speak to the W&L Conservative Society and
their guests at 3:30 p.m. Wednesday, March 11 in the Jackson Room of the
Robert E. Lee Hotel. He will talk on conservative solutions to poverty and
unemployment.

 

 

With Easter vacation already flashing the “Walk” sign, why not
decide before you go home on your number one suit and the rest of
your wardrobe. Aside from the traditional dress-up holiday, there
may be decisive interviews for either a summer job or a permanent
one if you're a graduating senior—-and the clothes you wear—plus
the way that you wear them—make the pivotal first impression.
You want it to be right at first sight, so, let’s take a run-down on
what you might well select this Spring in fashion.

YOUR NUMBER ONE SUIT for warmer

weather is next to weightless in the new lighter-
than-ever flannels and polyester/wool blends.
Color-wise, consider the more definite blues, the
new lighter greys; see the classic Glen Urquhart
or ‘glen’ plaids.

THE GIFT OF ‘GAB’ you get with the return of

natural tan gabardine. Its fine diagonal twill
weave and surface sheen make it an excellent
choice for your Number One Suit. Today’s gab-
ardines also come in lighter weight wools and
new polyester/wool blends.

 

PRIDE OF THE OUTFIT: REGIMENTAL

STRIPES ... the resurgence noted by ESQUIRE
last fall is gaining momentum for Regimental
Stripes—the traditional colors of the historic

oe British regiments. With scores of these famed
x oo regiments—like the Grenadier Guards, the
Royal Fusiliers, the Inskilling Dragoons—
there’s quite a roll-call of striking color com-
binations in pure silk repps for your selection.

DRESS SHIRTS—-SHOES—BELT . White Button Down Oxfords

are still very much de rigeur, and there are handsome variations in
narrow tape stripes of blue, grey, olive. Also, although you ‘can’t
go wrong’ with a white broadcloth tab collar dress shirt, why not
dress up with the newest pale tones of blue, olive or cream. With
suits in Blue or Grey, wear BLACK SHOES or the VERY DARK:
EST BROWNS...and RIB SOCKS are always smart and correct.
Your DRESS BELT is LEATHER with an important har ness- -type
buckle in polished metal.

AT THE SUMMIT—YOUR HAT... where the
decisions are made, it’s the narrow snap-brim
felt in brown or olive—welt edge, raw edge or
grosgrain-bound.

BIG SWEATER ON CAMPUS—THE CARDIGAN .... the button-

front coat-sweater is tops in campus popularity. Tops in favor are
the lofty Shetland and the open-knit Alpaca wool or wool blends in
solid colors or stripes.

BEACH- eounO! Should your vacation find you beached around

Ft. Lauderdale or Bermuda, say, then sports-
wear moves into number one spot. Here you'll
see a lot of TIGER—the bold, tawny color that’s
getting the roar of approval from campus men
everywhere. They pick it up in sportshirts like
this, sweaters, ties, socks. Find it in sharp, solid
tones or mixed—for example, a houndstooth
sportcoat checked in Black and Tiger... and let
them see you “burning bright” in fashion.

Lamb Advises Open EC Meetings

(Continued from page 2)
dent body as to just what the EC
is doing, and an inability of the var-
ious members of the EC to take a
poll on issues which confront them.
This is not necessarily catastrophic,
but at times it is unhealthy.

Since at times there is no practi-
cal remedy of the latter situation
(else we would have a Greek polis
and not a representative govern-
ment) perhaps something can be
done about the former.

In short, there is no reason why
legislative sessions of the EC should
not be open to all students. Two
years ago, these meetings were open-
ed to the members of the press, but
they have only sporadically sent re-
porters to the meetings. Students
still have very little idea of either
what the EC does or how well it
does it.

Matters of Interest

I have no illusions as how well at-
tended these meetings would be—
very few students would come. But

 

there are a few occasions when ser-
ious matters are being debated, and
it is at these times when both the
EC and the student body would
benefit from open meetings. People
interested in such things as the var-
ious committees’ functions, the prog-
ress of the Mock Convention, or
student body fund allocation would
greatly profit from attendance at
EC meetings. When debate on such
matters is scheduled, students could
be notified of time, so they could

come, observe, and perhaps con-
tribute from the floor.
This should in no way, however,

interfere with the secrecy of honor
trials, for obvious reasons. But there
is no reason why legislative meet-
ings should not be open to any stu-
dent who is interested in coming.
If nothing else it would help them
in knowing whom to vote for in
Spring elections—they would be
more thoroughly acquainted with
both issues and abilities and opin-
ions of members of the EC.

 

Appeasement Policies Blasted

later he offered a ‘negotiated freeze’
on delivery systems.” (Emphasis
added.)

On the other hand, we find in a
booklet published by The Center For
Strategic Studies at Georgetown
University that “the Soviet leader-
ship, both political and military, has
reached a working consensus on the
need to support a policy of detente
as a strategic course of action.”

After stating Soviet goals,
the article proceeds: “Premier

Khrushchev may regard these
goals as possible phases or incre-
mental steps in a single strategy,
whereby further economic growth

would serve as a step toward the
attainment of strategic parity, and

strategic parity would serve as a

necessary step toward strategic
supremacy.”
Different policy goals must

inevitably be the products of these
divergent analyses. The goal of those
who share the first and in whose
breast “hope springs eternal” is to
seek a workable relationship be-
tween communism and the free
world that will preserve peace in
a “world safe for diversity.”

Contrast the goal proceeding
from the second—victory over
communism through concerted po-
litical, economic, psychological, and
subversive efforts. A global stategy
designed to diminish the Soviet
power base and challenge com-
munist aggressions on all fronts.
To these men peace without vic-
tory is a dangerous illusion,

It is in this context that the spe-
cific proposals, or lack of them,
from aspirants for public office
from both parties take on meaning
and must be understood.

legian, but is only citing the detri-
ment that the publication in its
present state has been to the name
of the University and the much more
clever humor of which the students
here are capable. Blunt grossities, he
feels, are less funny than well-
written satire and subtle humor.

 

Editor Defends Collegian

The attempt to remove the school’s
support from the Collegian, however,
is expected to be unpopular with
the student body. Collegian editor,
Tain Tompkins, who, as a member
of the Publications Board, has been
aware for some time of the endang-
ered position in which the Collegian
has been put, spoke up in favor of
the publication when interviewed
yesterday.

Tompkins admitted that Dean At-
wood’s criticisms were excellent and
that Wootton had a point, but said,
“I wouldn’t undertake to edit it if
I didn’t think it was worth defend-
ing.’ He stated that he could not
disagree with some of the criticisms
but was strongly opposed to this
action which would possibly mean
the end of the Collegian.

To bring an end to the Collegian,
he said, would be bringing to an
end the most popular of the campus
publications. He pointed out that
the Collegian ranks as one of the
oldest and most famous college hu-
mor magazines, and despite present
events, is enthusiastically accepted
by the substantial majority of stu-
dents,

The Collegian is well budgeted for
the remainder of this year, but

would be forced to rely on subserip-
tion sales if the University denied
it a sanction to collect as it does
now. Whether it will survive or not
is ultimately, according to Tomp-
kins, a test of popularity.

Goldwyn’s Talk Slammed

(Continued from page 1)
with every major cliche imagin-
able—love, sex, pregnancy, abor-
tion, the draft, and some almost
dead college slang.

 

At his lecture, someone asked Mr.
Goldwyn who was responsible for
the photography in his picture. He
said, in effect, that the final re-
sponsibility was his, but that often
such decisions were left to tthe di-
rector of photography. As the pho-
tography was really the only nice
thing about the film I feel quite
safe in assuming the credit for this
goes to the director of photography
and not to Mr. Goldwyn. Despite
his unusually good intentions, the
feeling that one has on leaving the

film is that Mr. Goldwyn lacks
imagination, talent, and insight. As
for Mr. Garrett, he should be
ashamed.

entertainment. Natalie Wood is a
contender for this year’s Oscar in
the best actress category, and the
film bagged four other nominations
for Academy Awards as well.

Membership Boost

Gets IFC A

In its weekly meeting Monday
night the IFC voted to increase
membership from two to three men
per house. The motion for the in-
crease received the necessary two-
thirds vote, and passage next week
by the same margin will make it a
part of the newly adopted IFC
Constitution.

The three members to represent
each house will consist of the house
president and two other members,
elected for a full year. These two
members must not be in the same
class. This will bring the total mem-
bership of the council to fifty-four.

According to IFC President Art
Broadus, the motion was made be-
cause of the increase in number of
officers required by the new con-
stitution and also to supply more
men for committee work on various
IFC committees.

Exchange Program

Freddie Cooper, IFC vice presi-
dent, reported that he has spoken
to members of the Chamber of
Commerce concerning a program
whereby fraternity men and men
of the various Lexington organiza-
tions can meet and talk with each
other. A motion was made and
passed that the IFC sponsor an
exchange-type program with the
various clubs in order to improve
relationships between students and
local residents. In the near future
fraternity men will begin eating with
such local organizations as the Lions
Club and then men from _ these
groups will return the visits and
eat in various fraternity houses.

Blaine Brownell, a Kappa Sig
junior, was elected chairman of the
projected IFC weekend to be held
in the spring of 1965. He will be
in charge of selecting a theme and

Rockefeller Leader Speaks Here
At Meeting Of State Chairmen

By BILLY CANNON

Marshall Coleman, chairman of
Young Southerners For Rockefeller,
spoke before a meeting of the State
Chairmen of W&L’s upcoming Mock
Convention last night and empha-
sized the importance of the local
convention while dodging questions
concerning the Governor’s third
place finish in his neighboring state
of New Hampshire’s recent primary.

Coleman, a senior law student at
Virginia, has been closely connected

with the governor and has done a
great deal of campaigning for him
in the South.

“New Hampshire presented a bad
situation,” said Coleman. “The re-
sults were indecisive, but I feel it
was a_ great victory for the mod-
erate candidates of which I classify
Governor Rockefeller a member.”

Glee Club Plans Program
With R-M For March 22

By GENE HATFIELD

The Washington and Lee Glee
Club joins the Randolph-Macon
Chorus Sunday night, March 22, for
a Palm Sunday concert. The per-
formance will begin at 8 p.m. in the
Randolph-Macon auditorium.

Featured will be Johann Sebastian
Bach’s Christ Lay in Death’s Dark
Prison Cantata No. 4, performed by
both groups. In addition, the W&L
glee club will present selections
from Antonio Vivaldi’s Gloria mass,
Handel’s “Now Let Every Tongue
Adore Thee” and Bach’s “Hallelu-
jah, Amen.” Baritone Bill Supon will
be the soloist on the Gloria selec-
tion.

In preparation for the concert,
the glee club rehearses in Lynch-
burg Monday night, and Randolph-
Macon Chorus travels to Lexing-
ton for rehearsal Wednesday night.

The same program will be pre-
sented Tuesday night, March 24, at
the Lexington Presbyterian Church.

This afternoon the glee club sings
for Lexington High School in an
afternoon appearance. Still on the

agenda for the glee club this spring
are two joint concerts with the
Longwood Chorus. One will be n
the Longwood campus and one will
be the glee club’s annual perform-
ance for the Southern Interscholas-
tic Press Association. This will con-
clude the glee club’s schedule for
the year.

The glee Club has just returned
from a tour of Philadelphia and sur-
rounding area. Performances were
given at the Shriner’s Hospital for
crippled children in Philadelphia,
the Tatnall Preparatory School in
Wilmington, Delaware, and Beaver
College in Philadelphia. The latter
was a joint concert with the Beaver
Chorus.

Mr. Robert Stewart, the club’s di-
rector, expressed satisfaction over
the performance of the glee club on
the tour. Tentative arrangements
were made for a visit by the Beaver
College Chorus to Lexington next
Spring.

The trip was sponsored by the
newly-formed Philadelphia alumni
group.

 

 

“Unsubsidized ‘Collegian’ Will Fold’
Indicated In Student Opinion Survey

By WARREN MONTGOMERY

Should the Southern Collegian
continue to receive University
subsidy, or does it no longer play a
vital role in the campus life of
W&L?

A resolution to withdraw Univer-
sity support from the University
humor magazine is presently be-
fore the EC and will be acted upon
shortly. The action was initiated by
Dean Atwood, Dean of Students.

In a student survey taken this
week, the majority of those ques-
tioned seemed to feel that the Col-
legian would fold if University sup-
port is withdrawn, If the school
were to take away its subsidy, stu-
dents commented, the Southern Col-
legian would have to rely on sub-
seription for its existence, and sub-
scription might prove to be inade-
quate.

A law student pointed to the case
of UVa.’s humor magazine. This
publication was cast out of the uni-
versity fold in 1958 and collapsed
the following year of financial prob-
lems.

Many Endorsers

There is a large number of stu-
dents which endorse the Collegian
as it is and disagrees that its “off-
color” humor hurts the University

image or the magazine’s quality.

 

This group feels that a humor mag-
azine like the Collegian occupies an
important place in the University
life, and it does not feel that it is
necessary for the magazine to serve
an educational purpose to make it
a worthwhile campus institution. A
sophomore pointed out that the
Presbyterian Davidson College spon-
sors a similar magazine, Scripts and
Patches, and wondered why non-

denominational W&L should be
“more prudish” than a_ parochial
school,

A number of students were “qual-
ified” supports of the Southern Col-
legian. Some students indicated that
they personally think the magazine
amusing and so do their dates, but
they wouldn’t show it to their par-
ents. One person admitted that it
doesn’t matter to him whether the
Collegian is “clean” or not, but
“the humor should be more subtle

and varied—the article by the Hol-

lins girls was good, for instance.
Collegian Enemies

One junior that supports with-
drawal of University funds from the
magazine stated that he felt that
losing the Collegian in its present
form would be no great loss to the
student body. Another student re-
marked that the magazine would be
much better and could be more

“gross” if it were not connected
with the University.

Perhaps the foremost student sup-
porter of Dean Atwood’s proposal is
Phi Delt senior Randy Wootton. His
reasoning, and that of most of the
proposal’s supporters goes as fol-
lows:

“It is granted that the Southern
Collegian is acceptable to the ma-
jority of W&L students and to its
subscribers; however, it is generally
offensive to many dates, parents of
students and dates, and to some of
the faculty and administration staff
at Washington and Lee.

“It is felt that the gross and
shocking “humor” which makes the
magazine offensive to this latter

group is due to one main reason—
the income of the Collegian is as-
sured. The editors do not have to
strive for perfection in order to
keep the magazine going.
Offensiveness Serious

| “It is contended by those support-
ing Dean Atwood’s resolution, that
the problem of Collegian offensive-
ness is sufficiently serious to re-
quire some action.

“If the Collegian were to be taken
off school subsidy and placed on a
subscription basis, a limited number
of copies would be issued. A sub-

has been able to initiate social leg-
islation in New York while balanc-
ing the budget. The Governor has
repeatedly called for more state’s
rights and state’s responsibilities.”

“His record is striking,’ noted
Coleman, calling to attention the
Governor’s victory in New York in
1958. “He won in a large and crucial
state at a time when the Democrats
were sweeping the country by beat-
ing an incumbent by 50,000 votes.
The experts considered it impossible.

Turning to the Republican Party,
the UVa. student body president
emphasized, that “the hard core
Republicans, meeting in San Fran-
cisco ,will be looking for a candi-
date who can run a good race.
Johnson’s great strength in the
South must be offset by a man who
can win in the Northeast and in-
dustrial states.”

“As evidenced in 1960 it takes a
powerful political machine to win
the presidency. I consider Rocke-
feller’s the strongest in history with
the exception of possibly Senator
Kennedy’s.”

Burke, who threw the bulk of the
questions at Coleman, felt that “if
Rockefeller can’t win in New Hamp-
shire, where can he win?”

“Goldwater, as a foreigner to the
New England region, finished num-
ber 2,” said Burke, “I believe he’ll
receive a great deal more support
in Oregon and California.”

Local chairman Steve Hibbard, of
the Rockefeller for President cam-
paign refuted Burke saying, “From
actual appearance Rocky didn’t gain
ground in New Hampshire, but in
the fact that Goldwater talked of
getting 60 per cent of the vote and
then successively dropped his pre-
piction to as low as 35 per cent,
while finally polling 23 per cent,
Rockefeller did make substantial
gains in picking up ground on Gold-
water. It is a fallacy to say ‘What’s
going to happen if Rockefeller can’t
win next door.’ It must be realized
that Lodge was a favorite son can-
didate and New Hampshire is a
conservative state. Goldwater should
have shown strength.

“Evidence from all the pools taken
show that Lodge seriously detracted
from votes. If it had been a two-
man race, Rockefeller would have
won.”

The student _ political
agreed on three points.

1. The real test of strength will
come in the California primary June

2. Washington and Lee’s conven-
tion has taken on untold strength
since the indecisive results in New
Hampshire prove pratically noth-
ing.

3. The contest will boil down to
a two man race for the nomination
unless a third force should sweep
California.

Hibbard conceded, “Governor
Rockefeller is going to get an out-

leaders

and-out victory in California.
Rockefeller hoped to have most of
the state’s delegates pledged be-

fore the primary. He hasn't gotten
the delegates committe, but they are
against Goldwater.”

John A. Wells, New York chair-
man of the Rocky machine, told a
New York audience last week that
“the three most important victories
Governor Rockefeller needs are the
New Hampshire Primary, the Cal-
ifornia contest, and Washington and
Lee’s Mock Convention.

Rockefeller lost in New Hamp-

Peterson Speaks
On Free Economy

Last Tuesday afternoon Dr. Wil-
liam H. Peterson, distinguished au-
thor and business book editor of the
Wall Street Journal spoke to the
Conservative Society on the impor-
tance of free enterprise.

A native of Princeton, New Jersey,
Dr. Peterson wrote The Great Farm
Problem, which was published in
1959. Besides writing this book, he
has published articles in many dif-
ferent magazines and serves as an
associate professor of economics at
Princeton.

In his lecture, Dr. Peterson stated
that our Constitution is not only a
legal document but also an economic
document. He believes that free
enterprise should govern the econ-
omy exclusive of State intervention
since the purpose of the constitu-
tion is to limit and diffuse the pow-
er of the State.

Then he turned his attention to
the problem of poverty and used as
an example Harlan County, Ken-
tucky, the poorest county in Amer-
ica. In Harlan County, he stated
that a majority of the families had
cars, electricity, and other modern
conveniences in camparison with all
other countries, the conditions of
Harlan County were good.

Although by American standards
Harlan County is in poor economic
condition, he mentioned that pov-
erty is relative. He stated that Har-
lan County’s favorable comparison
with other countries is a tribute to
our free enterprise system.

Next Dr. Peterson discussed the
problem of unemployment. He
stated that unemployment was not
caused by the free market system
but on the contrary by government
intervention.

He stated that the three main
causes of unemployment are: un-
employment compensation, the min-
imum wage, and the labor union
monopolies.

In addition Dr. Peterson presented
his theory of the market place in
which the consumer is the most im-
portant. He stated that the cor-
poration is at the mercy of the
American consumer.

 

State Delegations Named

Lists of the state delegations for
the 1964 Mock Republican Con-
vention are posted on campus.
Assignments to the state delega-
tions were made on the basis of
requests by the state chairmen,
the resident state of the indiviv-
ual student, and, in an effort to
fill the delegations of those states
with new representatives in the
student body and those states with
a large number of delegates, many
asignment were made at random,

Five Named For
Wilson#A wards

Five Washington and Lee University seniors were ap-
pointed Woodrow Wilson Fellows for graduate study next fall.
In addition two students were given honorary mention although
they did not qualify as fellows. Those chosen as Fellows are

A. Kell, Edward N. Norton,
W. Wright. James W. Ramsey,

*Jr., and Meredith N. Weaver, Jr.,

received honorary mention,

The Washington and Lee winners
are among 1507 throughout the
United States and Canada selected
from 11,000 applicants. Candidates
must be nominated by faculty mem-
bers and are carefully screened by
regional and national selection com-
mittees.

Eckes, a member of LXA, has
served on the student control com-
mittee and has captained the debate
team. He is a history major and a
consistent honor roll student and
member of Phi Beta Kappa and
Omicron Delta Kappa.

Kell, also a member of Phi Beta
Kappa, has served on the Univer-
sity Christian Association, Concert
Guild, ReVue, and Graham-Lee So-
ciety. He has also been track co-
captain and an intramural official.
Kell is a philosophy major and has
frequently made the honor roll.

Edward M. Morton, SAE, has par-
ticipated on the debate team, swim-
ming team, and is now participating
in Mock Convention. He is a history
major.

Supak, ZBT, is presently vice
president of the student body and
has served on the Dance Board and
basketball team. He is a fine arts
major, has frequently appeared on
the honor roll, and has already
received the Elizabeth Barret Schol-
arship.

The final winner, Wright, current
secretary of the student body, has
also served as a dorm counselor.
He is a member of Phi Beta Kap-
pa, Omicron Delta Kappa, and Phi
Eta Sigma.

The Woodrow Wilson Fellowship
grants its fellows full tuition and
fees for the first year at the gradu-
ate school of their choice as well as
a living stipend of $1,800.

In accepting a Woodrow Wilson
Fellowship, the candidate assumes
a moral obligation to complete at
least one year of graduate studies
and to give serious thought to a
career in teaching.

A Fellow is supported for one
academic year of two semesters, two
trimester, or three quarters, even
though his graduate school requires
more time for the completion of the
M.A. degree. Traveling expenses
and books are paid for from the
Fellow’s living allowance. The
Woodrow Wilson program aims to
help students earn a doctorate as
soon as possible, and so the Fellow
assumes an obligation to make rea-
sonably sure of getting his own
support beyond the first graduate
year.

A fellow may not hold any other
fellowship at the same time as he
holds the Woodrow Wilson. While
the Foundation does not support
Fellows beyond the first year of
graduate study, it sends subventions
to graduate schools at which Wood-
row Wilson Fellows are enrolled,
and this money may be available for
the support of graduate students be-

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che King-tum Phi

Friday Edition
Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

 

: The Southern Collegian

W&L has once again joined the bandwagon. While the
nation passes judgment on the respective cases of Baker,
Hoffa, Ruby, etc., the University has spotlighted a moral issue
all its own: the Southern Collegian. Several weeks ago, under
mounting pressure of anti-Collegian criticism, the Dean of
Students appointed himself initially as the prosecutor of the
University subsidized humor magazine. In the end, neverthe-
less, it will be the student body that must decide the fate of
the publication.

The fallacy of bringing the Collegian to a student plebiscite,
however, is this: the magazine does have mass appeal, in the
same way that the idea of University-subsidized contraceptives
or women in the dorms (try bringing those to a plebiscite!)
would have mass appeal. For this reason, critics do not doubt
that the Collegian may be somewhat popular; what they con-
demn is the means to which the magazine, because of a weak
staff and lack of talent, must continually resort in order to re-
tain this popularity. Thus, if this spring we are called on to
judge the merits of the Collegian as a University publication,
some touchstone other than “‘popularity’”’ should be the basis

of the final verdict.

 

Sellers Plays US President

In Kubrick’s

By BOB MOTTLEY
Stanley Kubrick’s Dr. Strange-
love or: How I Learned To Stop
Worrying and Love the Bomb is cur-
rently showing in Lynchburg and
deserves comment

for those who
want to give an
unusually ma-

cabre twist to an
evening at Macon.
This film is a
horror - comedy
that satirizes man-
kind’s ridiculous
life-and-death af-

   

"9 fair with the

Bomb. Strange-

Rtetiiny love is a brilliant,
edifying, shatteringly hilarious

movie that will keep you roaring
until the rug is pulled up and
neatly folded at the end. Its plot
in a nutshell: a crazed U.S. Air Force
general instructs his trigger-itchy
SAC bomber crews to attack Rus-
sia, without the knowledge or per-
mission of the American President
(a pleasant loser superbly portrayed
by Peter Sellers.)

Sellers also plays Dr. Strangelove,
a former German national who is
now the U.S. weapon specialist.
(I don’t want to spoil all of the
jokes, but the general’s reason for
attacking Russia is to annihilate the
“International Communist Conspi-
racy” which he suspects of pollut-
ing the stout Birch trees of the
West with flourides, contaminating
“all of natural bodily fluids.” Also,
the chief positive thinker among the
high flying bomber pilots is a Tex-
an named Slim Pickens—just what
will be left afterwards.)

When the news of the general's
action reaches the U.S. command
post, there is a certain amount of
consternation. Everything possible
is done to recall the bombers, with
the obvious result that one plane
easily manages to slip through the
bungling. Its bombs merily drop,
and lo—the Russians have a sur-
prise up their Cossack sleeves—a
“Doomsday Device” that is timed to
to go off whenever so much as one
acre of Soviet soil is vaporized.

Since Strangelove wasn’t playing
penney-ante, there is sufficient fur
flying to set off this Fateful ma-
chine, and it gleefully commences
a series of world-crisping explo-
sions. As the movie ends, the screen
billows with thermonuclear clouds
and a seductive female voice purrs:
“We'll meet again, don't know
where, don’t know when, but I
know we'll meet again some sunny
day.”

 

‘Strangelove’

The Absurd

Stanley Kubrick has accomplish-
ed at least one very significant
thing in this film: he has enabled
us to laugh at the most absurd
fears of our generation. The danger
joked about IS real, of course, and
Dr. Strangelove might not seem so
funny after a nuclear holocaust, but
for the present it serves as a long
needed tonic to shatter the “Bomb
psychosis” of recent years. Every-
one—the President, the Air Force
General, “Slim Pickins,” the USSR
premier, is made to appear so ridic-
lous that the American government
seems to be in the hands of the
Three Stooges and the Russian gov-
ernment in the clutches of the
Marx brothers—-Groucho, Harpo,
Chico, and Karl. The moral? Nu-
clear war is patently absurd. Why
not get a good laugh out of it be-
fore (1) it happens or (2) it be-
comes a snow of yesteryear? So,
strangelovely enough, man’s most
desperate fear becomes a crackling
shuttlecock for comedy, a hand
grenade tossed from friend to foe—
until—har-de-har-har—Bang!

There is genius as well as method
in this apparent madness, and Ku-
brick deserves just about every ac-
ecolade in the book. He has made
a “hot war” so laughable that only
morons could possibly indulge in it.
This is ultimately, what worries the
viewer between guffaws. Have we
morons in High Places? Of course
not, cackle, cackle. Still considering
the bottomless human capacity for
stupidity. ...

(If you should be caught in New
York in a red alert over Spring
vacation, I suggest the following
procedure: down a_ few bloody
Marys and run (do not walk) to
the nearest showing of Dr. Strange-
love. There could be no more ironi-
cal way to bow out.)

While on the subject of stupidity,
we might note that many individuals
in America have their heads wedged
firmly, either in sand or elsewhere.
They include: Goldwaterites, racists,
Old South idolizers, film critics
who don’t know what they are talk-
in about (present company except-
ed, thank you), superpatriots, con-
servatives, Republicans in general,
users of electrical toothbrushes, cer-
tain professors better left unnamed
(you fill in your on preferences),
“great guys,’ segregationists, most
Hollywood producers, and again lo-
cally, those so obsessed with illusions
of honor that they fail to see the
shirt being ripped from their own
backs.

At first glance Lodge’s im-
pressive victory in the New
Hampshire primary (35.4 of
the votes via a write in cam-
paign) would seem to indicate
that Lodge will be a formidable

candidate at the summer conven-
tion, for the Republican primary
winner in New Hampshire has even-
tually become the presidential nom-
inee in every instance except one

 

since the turn of the century. How
ever, most Republican party leaders
are denying Lodge’s chance for
nomination and stating that Scran-
ton and Nixon are now the fore-
runners,

Lodge’s problem is somewhat anal-
ogous to that of the late Estes Ke-
fauver who won the New Hampshire
primary in 1952 but because of his
unpopularity with the party leaders
could never gain the nomination.
Republicans have complained about
Lodge’s lackadasical campaigning in

with state chairmen campaigning

didn’t feel like doing so. Moreover,
Lodge probably cannot be counted

Friday Edition
Dear Sirs:

I object to your article last week
by N. E. Personne for two reasons.
First it was not signed, and second
I do not see how that kind of hu-
mor can lead to any but harmful
results.

With regards to my first complaint,
I feel that it is quite cowardly to
attack a man publicly while hiding
behind the shield of a pen name. I
presume that the author was afraid
to put his name in print because the
doctor might strike back. The only
possible way he could hurt N. E.
is medically, and I am certain the
author would not visit the doctor.
believing him to be dangerous.

What did the author hope to gain
by this kind of slander? If there
was a deeper purpose beyond being
humorous, I imagine it was either
to increase the competence of the
doctor or to have him replaced.
Such an attack might result in the
doctor’s loss of self-confidence—
making him worse. If the object
were to fire him, I believe that the
unfairness of the article will cause
the administration to condemn the
student rather than the doctor.

If the author truly feels the doc-
tor is incompetent, and that meas-
ures should be taken to protect the
students from him, why does he
not attack the problem in an orderly
and fair manner? He should make
some real investigations and find out
if the doctor truly is a hazard. If

 

he then has some real proof, it
should be submitted to the adminis-
tration or the paper. If no reaction
results, then he might resort to
satire.

BOB FUSSELL

Deplorable Situation
Exists On Campus

Dear Sirs:

I am really surprised that after
this deplorable chain of events no
one has taken the initiative to
speak out about this matter. A sit-
uation exists right now on this
campus which presently is more
urgent than the question of inte-
gration or moral depravity.

One young man complained to
the school physician of a constant
and throbbing pain in his abdomen;
he was cursorly examined and dis-
missed with the diagnosis of
stomach gas. Realizing that this
pain was more than gas, the student
walked to the hospital and was op-
erated on within several hours for
an emergency apendectomy.

Another student complained of|
feeling weak and at times extremely
dizzy. He did not feel that he would
be able to take his exams. The school
physician again dismissed his sym-
toms as minor, and refused to ex-
cuse this individual from exams.
Following the exam period, this stu-
dent ventured home to his own
physician and was found to be suf-
fering from mononucleosis.

Letters Discuss Physician, ‘Collegian’

Yet another student suffered a
serious injury in an athletic con-
test and asked to be excused from
classes because of the unbearable
pain. He too was dismissed with
minor medication, and refused ab-
sence from classes. Venturing ‘to the
hospital on his own, this young man
was persuaded to remain as a pa-
tient for at least a week, or risk
a serious operation.

A student from a neighboring un-
iversity was badly cut in a fall here
during Fancy Dress. Taken to
Stonewall Jackson Hospital he was
bandaged by the night nurse and
urged to return the next morning
when a doctor would be on duty. On
returning, still no doctor, this gen-
tleman was urged to go to the Uni-
versity Infirmary for treatment by
the school physician. There he was
not only refused treatment by the
head nurse, but the bleeding young
man was chastised for questioning
school policy. This student was
forced to return to his own campus
for treatment and is still taking pen-
ecillin injections for the infection
which followed his unattended
wound.

These are but a few cases among
many which could be cited. The
students of this university are en-
titled to competent and reliable diag-
nosis and medical care. Under the
present situation, neither is possible.

Before further improving the
physical plant, integrating, or seek-
ing foundation grants, I suggest that
something constructive be done
about the medical staff of this uni-
versity.

Lodge Victory Hurts Barry & Rocky;
Nixon & Scranton Chances Boosted

the defeat of Rockefeller and Gold-
water seriously impair their chances
for victory. Goldwater stated that if
he procured less than 35 per cent
of the vote it would be disastrous—
he received 23 per cent of the vote.
(His campaign manager was more
conservative when he put the figure
at 30 per cent). In any case Gold-
water’s reactionary political ideology
(such as his views on social security
and “shoot from the hip” foreign
policy) proved unacceptable even to
a conservatively inclined electorate.

Rockefeller

On the other hand Rockefeller
was no more acceptable to the pub-
lic, polling 20.6 per cent of the vote.
Most agree that Lodge’s write in
vote hurt Rockefeller more than
Goldwater; however, Rockefeller’s
prime problem continues to be his
untimely divorcee and remarriage
after 30 years of matrimony. Rocke-
feller used all types of campaigns to
combat this, ranging from explana-
tory pamplets to frequently appear-
ing with his new wife; however, the
moral implications of his remarriage
could not be overwhelmed.

Nixon and Scranton

Having discounted the candidates
placing first, second, and third as
strong contenders for the nomina-
tion, Nixon and Scranton, who fin-
ished fourth and eighth respectively,
have increased their possibility of
nomination. Nixon, who managed to
receive over 49 per cent of the popu-
lar vote against Kennedy, has been
considered a strong contender ever
since Kennedy’s assassination, and in
recent months Scranton, who is con-
sidered a middle of the road politi-
cian, has been considered as a com-
promise candidate.

Nothing to Lose

Scranton, however, has been in-
sistent in claiming that he is not a
contender. His claims might very
well be true, for Scranton who is
still in his 40’s might feel he has
a better chance in a later election
than against the very popular John-
son. This leaves one man—former
vice president Nixon. Nixon has
nothing to lose and everything to
gain by running. This will probably
be his last chance to grab the nom-
ination; he has no chance for an-
other political office and will prob-
ably lose most of his popularity in
the coming years. Moreover, the
Republican party, by running Nix-
on, will not destroy a politician who
might have a_ brighter political
chance in the future.

 

Baur Itemizes
Spring Itinerary

By DREW BAUR
Friday Columnist

Truely, Rod Cockshutt, spring is
coming. Since no one else has as yet
reiterated the general happening of
spring, it may as well be now as
later.

The school anxiously awaits:
spring vacation in Nassau, Florida,
Bermuda, and Ft. Bragg; the Begin-
ing of the Goshen teams; Sunday
afternoon townie dates at Twin
Falls; the annual fun and games of
the freshman riots (Princeton out-
did us last year); the assault from
UVa. during Springs Weekend;
everyone complaining about the
Saturday quizzes of Springs Week-
end; Washington University monop-
olizing the spring CAC tournament;
attacks from rather expected and
unexpected sources on everything
from virginity to groundskeeping;
the coming of the Mock Convention
(or the second of a series of visits
by Miss Doreas Campbell); the
kegs and combos of Election Week;
full jails in Lexington and B.V,;
handing in term papers a week late;
settling down for exams; two
weeks of exams and flicks; a grin on
Ed Side’s face; a grin on another
Ed’s face; 1,000 official SIPA guides;
Finals; burying of hatchets for grad-
uation; resurrection of hatchets
when grades come out; but then
you’re home. Spring sprung.

P.E.

In addition to the joys of spring,
freshmen are quite lucky in having
the pleasure of participating in the
second physical fitness test of their
first year. It certainly is a shame
that the rest of the student body
along with faculty and alumni
could not join them in the 1964
jock rating,

Bridgewater;

Track Season Promising

BY JOHNNY GRAHAM
If Wednesday night can be used as a barometer for
coming events, the Washington and Lee 1964 track team
should have a very successful season.

The Generals took seven of

12 individual events, and used

superior depth to put out a 63- 35 win over Bridgewater College

at the VMI field house.

Once more it was the Kell sissias|
ers, Robin and Chris, who led |
way with four firsts between them.

Chris won the 60-yard dash in|
6.4 seconds, and fought a strong |
challenge in ‘the last 20 yards of the|
500-yard dash to take it in 63.8 |
seconds.

Robin won his specialty, the triple |
jump, with a leap of 41’ 3 3/4”, and |
also took the high jump at 5’ 8”. He!
moved the bar immediately to 6’ 2”
to try for the record, but failed on
three successive attempts. He also}
took second in the high hurdles.

The big victory of the evening
came in the shot put where Gay
Gasque got off a toss of 46’ 9 1/2”,
to win the event. His throw breaks
the W&L record of 45’ 8” set by A
B. Platt in 1957, but is unofficial
because it was done indoors.

The Generals’ other two firsts}
came on Johnny Graham’s 12’ jump}
to win the pole vault, and Riff
O’Connor’s victory in the 2-mile
run.

W&L added to its point total with
seconds by Andy Kilpatrick in the
mile, Jim Stalnaker in the ‘road
jump, Gordon Gay in the pole vault,
Spencer Atwater in the low hurdles |
and Jim Thompson in the 880. The
Generals also took all but two of
the third places.

Head track coach Norman Lord
is looking forward to a successful
season. Stating before ‘the season
that he needed “at least 75 bodies”
on the team, Lord now has 87 men
on the roster.

Lord handles the runners and
jumpers, while assistant coach Lee
McLaughlin takes charge of the
weight men.

The team is fairly evenly spaced
through the different events, with
a heavy concentration in the javelin
and middle distance sections.

Captains for the season are
Skip Essex, a middle distance man
who has a 49.2 quarter mile to his
credit, Robin Kell, and John Pear-
son, a hurdler who has been side-
lined all winter with a broken ankle,
and who has just begun to hit his
stride again,

With all events except the javelin,
discus and 220 run on Wednesday,
prospects for the season are high.

“We have perhaps our toughest
meet right at the start of the sea-
son, and I hope that we'll be ready
for it,’ said Lord. The Thinclads
open at home against Old Dominion
College at 3:45 on March 27.

The longest-running event of in-

The second round of the hand-

necessary a few weeks back when

Beta, Delt, and KA all came up

with identical records in the first

round, saw Delt finish on top with

an 8-7 record, KA second at 7-2,

How To Count—Intramural-Wise

The intramural scoring system is
a hodgepodge of incomprehensibility
to most people. A jumble of base
points, league points, play-off points
and raw score points, it makes little
sense to the average participant.

Each fraternity starts the year

with 100 base points, sort of a gift.
Penalties are
such as missing meetings (ten
points and turning in late entry
forms (five points).

After that,

50 participation points.
Then,
league,

get 15 points for finishing last.

Thus a fraternity can earn at least
60 points a sport just by showing

up, no matter how badly it does.

League points build up in ag-
gregates of five to reach 30 points
for a first place finish. Playoff points
work much the same way, running
from five points for fourth to 20

points for a championship finish.

Thus, in a team sport, the school
champion receives 100 points, the

In individual sports, such as

fraternity, raw  score-wise (by
NCAA scoring) receives 50 intra-

which is worth 12 points.

Under this system, the difference
between fifth place and fifteenth

All of last year’s regulars are
playing again this year for Wash-
ington and Lee’s varsity tennis team.
Practice began Monday with 17
varsity candidates trying for posi-
tions. The team will ultimately be

cut to ten men.

For the first time, the team’s
schedule will feature a spring trip,
which will be North Carolina and
other Virginia schools. The squad
will play 15 regular season matches,
seven more than last season.

Top Three Return
Number one man, captain Jim
DeYoung will lead the team which

includes numbers two and three men

ing lettermen.

Last season the team posted a 5-3
record, losing only to Hampden-
Sidney, George Washington and Vir-
ginia, all of whom the team will
meet again this year.

Fifteen Frosh Try Out

The freshman tennis team looks

has been seen thus far, according to

Last year’s freshman team com-
piled a 2-2 record defeating Vir-
ginia Episcopal and George Wash-
ington High. This season there are
fifteen candidates for the team,
which will be cut to ten men.

Washburn said, “In the freshman
squad there is some very fine prom-
ise from boys that showed up well
in the fall tournament.” Andy Kil-
patrick, a track team member, won
that event.

Among the freshman players are
Phil Thompson, Francis Grumbine,
Francis Jones and Doug Henckels.
The team opens their season April
ninth at home, against Virginia

Last week I mentioned only the
favorable aspects of the proposed
gym. Now it’s
time to look at
the other side of
the picture.

First—and most
important—where
would it be built?
The site of the
present gym
' would probably
= not be large
m enough unless

some of the park-

ing area were
used. The parking problem is bad
enough as it is, and the removal of
50 to 100 parking spaces would
create havoc.

 

O'Keefe

The next feasible site would be
the intramural field. Unfortunate-
ly this is probably too far away for
students to go back and forth be-
tween classes—unless they are
given ten minutes each way.

This would reduce the gym period
to 35 minutes. Such a span of time
could be long enough were it put
to its fullest possible use.

Athletic director E. P. “Cy”
Twombly has said he thinks the in-
tramural field would be too distant.
He suggested placing the gym at
the foot of the hill behind the
present gym. But then, out of sight,
it would not be a good show piece.

Twimbly said he favors leaving the
old gym standing. It could be used
exclusively for intramurals and
student overflow when the new
gym is filled with practice teams.

Also, the old gym would be a
perfect spot for holding dance sets.
“Those are bad enough on the floor
as it is,’ Twombly said. “The Mock
Convention will ruin it.”

Concerts could be held in the
new gym since bleachers will al-
ready be there, although if stu-
dents want to use chairs they
would have to continue to use the
present gym.

We have heard considerable doubt
expressed that the new gym would
be built within the next five to ‘ten
years as some have said it might
be.

In this matter, there is an impor-
tant fact to take into consideration.
Fred Cole is W&L’s president, and
quite a sports enthusiast.

Feddeman Answers Complaints Of Incompetence

By KEN McGRAW
Assistant News Editor

Over the past three weeks a series
of articles and letters which have
appeared in the Friday Edition have
attacked Dr. F. A. Feddeman, school
physician. Last week in an initialed
“Letter to the Editor” the first con-
crete evidence against Feddeman
was presented.

This evidence consisted of four
cases drawn from over the past six
years. In the first case, a student
sick with mononucleosis was not
excused from classes. In the second,
Dr. Feddeman failed to diagnose a
case of appendicitus. The third case
cited involved a serious athletic in-
jury which was not recognized as
such, and, in the fourth, a U. Va.

 

student was refused treatment in

the University’s infirmary.
Feddeman’s Explanation

In an interview yesterday, Dr.
Feddeman freely discussed these
four specific cases in which he was
accused of incompetency to clear up
the apparent misconception which
surround them. As for the student
sick with mononucleosis but not ex-
cused from exams, Dr. Feddeman
stated that the student had had
mono for some time and was in the
process of getting over it when he
first came to the infirmary. Labora-
tory tests were made, but the re-
sults were not immediately avail-
able.

Since the student was not in dan-

 

ger of spreading any disease which
he might have, and since he was
not running a fever, the student was
advised to finish the exams which
he had already begun. When the
lab tests came back showing that
the student was actually sick, he
had already gone home.

Injustice of Letter

The accusation that he failed to
diagnose a case of appendicitis is,
Dr. Feddeman admits, true. The
letter, however, threw this case out
of proportion. The letter does not
consider that over the twelve years
that Dr. Feddeman has been at
Washington and Lee he has had
thousands of students who have
come in with stomach aches. The

 

case cited, which occurred some six
or seven years ago, is the only
one which was not properly handled.
It was his mistake, he readily ad-
mits, but this one case does not
warrant the claims of incompetency
resulting from it.

In regard to the third case which
involved a student injured in ath-
letics, Dr. Feddeman was unable to
comment because the facts presented
in the accusation were too vague. He
could recall no case similar to this.

Student at Fault
The fourth case in question in-
volves, said Dr. Feddeman, a mis-
conception which the letter writer
seems to have of his role and cuties
as school physician and of the func-

 

tion of the school’s infirmary. The
University’s medical staff and facili-
ties, he said, are for students only
and not for students’ dates, friends,
or professors. As for this case in
which the medical staff was criti-
cized for not treating a U. Va. stu-
dent, the boy involved had lied at
the hospital. He told the nurse on
duty that he was a W&L student
and it was for this reason that he
was sent to the infirmary. He was
sent back to the hospital when he
was discovered to be lying, but was
not bleeding at the time, as was
stated in the Friday paper.

Happens Every Year

On the subject in general, Dr.
Feddeman commented that medicine

is not a perfect science. Opinions
differ in individual cases and one
cannot always be right. Also he
stated that the picture changes rap-
idly in many cases. What might
seem to be a harmless cold or
stomach ache at one point can de-
velop, in a short period of time,
symptoms of a more serious sick-
ness. In such cases the medical staff
is helpless unless the student comes
back.

Dr. Feddeman stated that he was
not overly disturbed by the recent
attacks, but naturally does not ap-
preciate them. He pointed out that
something similar to this happens
every year. Last year it was the
Slater System and two years ago
it was the Co-op.

McDowell Delivers Views
On ‘Byrd Organization’

By HOWARD EPSTEIN

Nationally syndicated columnist,
Charles McDowell, Jr., analyzed the
Byrd political organization with its
influence on state and national pol-
itics last night to a crowded Lee
Chapel.

Rejecting his original topic of
“Virginia Politics,’ McDowell limit-
ed his subject to the “Byrd Organi-
zation,” although in many cases both
terms are synonymous. Speaking in
his hometown, he turned the lecture
into a folksy talk studded with hu-
mor and wit that captivated the au-
dience,

He started by describing the head
of the organization, 76-year-old Sen-
ator Harry F. Byrd, as “delightful
and wisest in his own way.” Then,
striking the heart of his speech, he
pointed out that, contrary to most
political machines, the Byrd “organ-
ization” is not thoroughly organ-
ized; rather, the key to its success
in controlling Virginia politics for
the last 40 years has been its di-
versity of leadership, even to the
point of confusion.

The organization itself he believed
to be “good government.” McDowell
first pointed out the lack of graft,
even in the periphery of the or-
ganization. Secondly, he emphasized
great distribution of political power
among the members of the organi-
zation, by demonstrating how Sen-
ator Byrd is acute to the desires of
the conservative democrats.

Extent of Byrd Organization

Thirdly, the extent of the organi-
zation become obvious through Mc-
Dowell’s frequent reference to the
“Byrd men.” Complete with the
Speaker of the House in Virginia,
many legislators, and Governor
Harrison, along with numerous lo-
cal officials, it seemed that every
election since the 1930’s was a con-
test between the “Byrd men” and
some form of opposition.

Another of the organizations’ ad-

dents are taking part in a local pro-
duction of the Gilbert and Sullivan
operetta H.MLS, Pinafore.

Taking principle roles in the show
are Phil Booth, a Pi Phi senior, who

Vaughan, a Delt sophomore, as the

Also in the cast are John Dixon,

will play in the orchestra.

The operetta will be given March
20 and 21 at 8 pm. in the Wad-

daughter of an English naval cap-
tain, is in love with Ralph Rack-
straw a sailor. Her father is de-
termined she will marry Sir Joseph

Admiralty.

vantages is the incompetence of the
opposition. At various times different
groups have challenged the Byrds,
but never with any lasting success.
The G.O.P., until recently, had no
interest in producing a strong par-
ty; the few partymen that existed
claimed party affiliation only in
hopes of political gain if and when
republicans gained office on the na-
tional scale.
Auti-Byrd Faction

Another form of opposition came
from the group whose feelings were
for the party but against the Byrds.
Led by Robert Whitehead this group
nearly toppled the organization on
several occasions, but due to un-
trained workers and an overzealous
drive, they never succeeded.

In national affairs, the Byrds are
a constant federal bug-a-boo. Never
silent, the Virginians are always

Must Commit Themselves Soon

 

Scranton, Lodge Losing Time

By J. BRUCE WHELIHAN

Governor William Scranton of
Pennsylvania was quoted as saying
recently that the race for the pres-
idential nomination at the Repub-
lican National Convention is still
wide open. He is one of the few who
think so.

Many political analysts are say-
ing that Scranton has the best
chance of walking off with the nom-
ination at the convention, which is
to be held in San Francisco be-
ginning July 13. An almost equal
number suggest that Ambassador
Henry Cabot Lodge’s write-in vic-
tory in New Hampshire has placed
him at the head of the list of hope-
fuls.

A few writers mention former
Vice President Richard Nixon, and
most agree that Arizona’s Senator
Goldwater and New York’s Govern-
or Nelson Rockefeller are lost causes,
in that neither has supporters who
are, above all else, Republicans.

 

Those suggesting that Scranton

will eventually receive the party
nominations are quick to point to
the fact that he is the only candidate,
other than Senator Margaret Chase
Smith of Maine, who is politically
“unsearred and unscathed.”

Scranton, however, is not acting in
accord with the wishes of his back-
ers. Although he has put himself in
the position where he would have
to accept the nomination if it comes,
he has not yet announced that he
desires the nomination. He cannot
wait much longer as a non-candi-
date.

Ambassador Lodge also cannot
wait much longer either. He is in
somewhat the same position as
Seranton as he has refused to sign
an affidavit saying he will not be-
come a candidate for the party nom-
ination under any circumstances.
Such a document is required of per-
sons wishing to withdraw their name
from the list of candidates in the
Oregon presidential preference
primary.

 

Individual Ideas

& Social Reality

Topic Of R-MWC’s 1964 ‘Focus’

The second annual Focus was held |
at Randolph-Macon Woman’s Col-
lege on the weekend of March 6, 7,
and 8. A student sponsored sympo-
sium, Focus seeks to tackle a new
topic each year. This year’s theme
was stated as: Individual Ideas and
Social Reality—To Explore the Re- |
lation of Individuals to the Ameri-
can Society. Under a program of
speakers, panels, seminars, and dis-
cussion groups, Focus presents a
critical approach to specific prob-
lems of American life.

 

Aspect of Law Discussed

Names Remain on Ballot

Both the ambassador and the gov-
ernor have made token efforts to
have their names removed from the
Oregon ballot. Neither name _ has
been withdrawn. The governor has
taken the unusual step of withdraw-
ing his biography from a guide to
be issued to Oregon’s Republican
voters.

What exactly is keeping either
Lodge or Scranton from committing
himself is not clear. Scranton may
be thinking of 1968. Lodge is prob-
ably thinking of Viet-Nam.

Richard Nixon, who is also in the
position of having to accept a draft
if one comes his way, is being pretty
much neglected. Perhaps columnists
have an agreement with the former
Vice President. If you don’t talk
about me, I won’t talk about you.

Candidates Plan Trips Abroad

It is important to note that the
titular head of the Republican par-
ty has increased his staff, for po-
litieal affairs, and is planning some
travel later in the spring. His cal-
endar presently includes trips to
South America and to South Asia.
Governor Scranton is planning a trip
to the Middle East sometime after
the Pennsylvania legislature ad-
journs.

Scranton does not, at the moment,
have the organization strength that
Lodge and Nixon can boast. Lodge’s
group is headed by his son George,
with an assist, interesting enough,
from Robert Mullen. Mullen was
former President Eisenhower's press
manager during the 1952 campaign.

No Word From Eisenhower

One of the most surprising facts
to date that former President
Eisenhower is still to be heard from.
The General close friend of
Lodge, and an admirer of Scranton.
Could the silence an indication
that he already knows what the out-
come is to be? He asked Lodge to

Heart Attack
Hits Gilliam
In Cincinnati

Dean Emeritus Frank J. Gil-
liam, who suffered a_ serious
heart attack in Cincinnati, Ohio,
Friday, seems to be “responding
to treatment” as of Tuesday
morning.

Dean and Mrs. Gilliam had
been on a trip visiting alumni
and prospective W&L students
when he was struck Friday. At
the time, his condition was listed
as critical and it remained so
through Saturday.

However, doctors said then that
if he survived a 72-hour crucial
period his chances for recovery
were good. Although he has
passed through that first three-
day period, Dean Gilliam remains
in very serious condition.

According to Presidential As-
sistant James W. Whitehead,
Dean Gilliam will have to stay in
the Cincinnati hospital “for sev-
eral weeks” before he can be
moved home.

Two years ago, in March, 1961,
Dean Gilliam suffered a _pre-
vious heart attack. At the time
he had just stepped down from
Dea nof Students to Dean of Ad-
missions, from which he retired
at the end of the 1962-63 school
term to become Dean Emeritus.

Mrs. Gilliam is with Dean Gil-
liam, who is in Holmes Hospital
in Cincinnati.

Kilpatrick has been editor of the
News Leader for the past 15 years.
He joined the staff as a reporter
in 1941, after graduation from the
University of Missouri.

Books, Published

His first book, The Sovereign
States, a history of state and federal
conflicts from a States’ Righter’s
point of view, appeared in 1957. The
Smut Peddlers, a study of obscenity
censorship and the pornography
racket followed in 1959. In 1962, his
Southern Case for School Segrega-
tion was published, expounding the
position of Southerners who oppose
integration of public schools.

He has twice won national awards
for his editorial writing. One of
these, the University of Missouri's
medal for distinguished service in
journalism, was awarded him for
his two-year campaign for the re-
lease from prison of a Negro wrong-

ly sentenced to a life term for
murder.
Kilpatrick serves as vice-chair-

man of the Virginia Commission on
Constitutional Government, a state
agency charged with “putting forth
the traditional Southern doctrines
of limited government and _ strict
construction,”

Spokesman for Conservatism

One of the best known and most
highly respected spokesman for po-
litical conservatism, Kilpatrick has
debated with leaders of the civil
rights movement, lectured at various
colleges and patriotic gatherings,
and most recently joined with other
national figures at a conference on
race relations at Haverford and
Bryn Mawr Colleges.

A question and answer period
will follow his talk here, and a re-
ception for him will be held from
6-7 p.m. tonight. The reception

The Passing Of An Epoch:
Requiem For Hell Raisers

They are gone now. The hill must be glad they’re
gone. When they went, a lot of bad things went with
them, if you look at it through the eyes of someone on the
hill.

When they went,
on Sem went.

When they went, back-to-back houseparties went.

When they went, weekday down-the-road teams went.

When they went, makeshift roadblocks of the by-pass
went,

When they went, drinking and spirit at football games
went.

When they went, the Gauley Bridge Hunt Club went
with them. That was so long ago, the story gets around
only rarely now. A group of them got together in a car
and headed for the University of West Virginia for a
party weekend.

The only thing they knew for sure was to turn at
the town of Gauley Bridge, West Virginia—one of those
towns with a garage on one side of the road and a cider
stand on the other. Only by the time they crossed the
state line, they weren’t seeing too well. So they missed
Gauley Bridge, and spent the rest of the day and night
hunting for it. Never did find it.

They are gone now. The hill is surely glad they’re
gone. But with them went a lot of good things about this
place, no matter whose eyes you’re looking through.

Like the speaking tradition. That’s right—they always
spoke. No matter who was passing them—even if they
thought he was a fish. They liked the speaking tradition—
they thought it was natural. They weren’t bent over the
books all the time or sitting in front of the tube stone-
faced; they were together, down the road, or at Doc’s,
or in the living room at the house with the history cold
quizzes. So it was natural to speak; even when it wasn’t
natural, they spoke. That was the way things were done
around here.

That’s all gone now, along with them.

They didn’t worry about whether or not the Assimila-
tion Committee had the right to tell them how to dress,
either. They just wore conventional dress, that’s all. They
did because they were proud of W&L, of its reputation
for having a campus-full of hospitable, well-dressed fun-
loving guys. They wanted to keep that reputation going.

They got their hair cut too. Because they wanted to
look neat. When they were pledges their fraternities
made them get a haircut twice a month. They just kept
the habit. Probably still do.

But that’s all gone now. The hell raisers are gone.
And anybody now who thinks he’s a hell raiser is wrong.
He’s not. He’s just pretending to be. Because a hell raiser
doesn’t wear long hair and sloppy clothes; he doesn’t get
drunk and scream at the top of his lungs until he throws
up

 

the Saturday-night motorcycle raids

That wasnt the hell raisers’ style at all. They were well-
groomed, well-dressed, and they could handle their
liquor and their women in stride. They knew the right
way to raise hell, and they raised a lot of it.

They are gone now. The hill is glad they’re gone. A
lot of problems went along with them. And along with
them went most of the color that made Washington and
Lee distinct.

 

 

We Were Wondering ...

Why the library insists on keeping Lady Chatter-
ley’s Lover and Women in Love on locked reserve
when both novels can be purchased in paperback
form in any bookstore for sixty cents. Thanks, but
no thanks, for protecting our innocence.

 

 

 

 

Fair Play For Feddeman

Dr. F. A. Feddeman, W&L’s school physician, has
been attacked in several articles printed by the Friday
Edition in recent weeks. While there is some truth in the
documented attacks, the nature of these articles has been
close to libelous.

On page one today is a news article which offers stu-
dents the proverbial ‘other side” of the coin. It conclu-
sively shows that Dr. Feddeman’s so-called incompetence
has been blown all out of proportion.

Some students on campus have complaints against the
way they have been treated at the infirmary, and these
complaints may be justified. But if they are to be brought
up for public consumption, they should be objectively
stated.

We certainly deplore the anonymous attacks made in
the Friday Edition against Dr. Feddeman, especially in
terms of the hundreds of students who have always re-
ceived good care from him when they needed it.

 

 

 

“The pang of death, a famous
doctor once told me, is often less
than that of a toothache.”

—Ernest Hemingway

After Ernest Hemingway’s ap-
parent suicide almost three years
ago there was a great deal of specu-
lation as to why he shot himself, if
he did. One such speculation came
from William Faulkner, who dis-
pised Hemingway as a_ literary
artist. It was Faulkner's belief that
Hemingway's scope was extremely
limited, and that in his old age he
had run out of things to say.

Faulkner believed Hemingway
must have realized that he was un-
able to offer anything new to the
literary world, and this realization,
coupled with the fact that he was
dying of cancer, led to his suicide.
Hemingway's skill with guns pre-
cluded the possibility of an accident
in Faulkner’s views.

Hemingway Needed Active Life

In my opinion there is a deeper
reason behind Hemingway’s suicide
which Faulkner may have felt and
left unexpressed. If one looks at
Hemingway’s life, it is immediately
obvious that he was a man filled
with “joie de vie’—he was an
ardent aficionado, if you will, of the
idea of an active life. Fishing, hunt-
ing, skiing, combat, the bull fights,
and expatriate life in Paris after
World War II: all were known inti-
mately by the man Hemingway. He

‘Few Men Die Of Old Age’ -
Ernest Hemingway, Part One

Reviewed by Roger Paine

believed that life must be constantly
affirmed.

In Hemingway’s view, a man ap-
preciates life most when he has
come into close contact with death.
Such contact causes a man to re-
turn to the moments and hours and
days ahead considerably more ap-
preciative of what he has. And
Hemingway came close to death sev-
eral times in his career—when he
was wounded during the war, when
he had dysentery and was flown off
the mountainside that later became
the scene for “The Snows of Kili-
manjaro,” and when he crashed in
Africa in 1954 the world thought he
had been killed.

Action Left in Old Age

These dramatic close calls had
ended, however, in Hemingway’s
later years. He couldn’t move around
as much as he had in the past, and
so his life was becoming rather
perfunctory. To a man such as Hem-
ingway, this was the worst possible
fate. Indeed, Hemingway had tried
to cling to the things he had always
done as he entered old age. He suc-
ceeded for a time, because his body
served him well enough, and his de-
sire pushed his physical strength to
the limit.

But after a time, Hemingway’s
physical strength began to fail him
as the cancer in his body took more
and more control. His spirit still de-
manded the outdoor life of hunting,

      

fishing, and camping, but his body
could not meet the old demand.
Finally, in the last stages of his life,
even his spirit failed him. These
considerations, combined with the
fact that there had been no recent
drama in his life, might well have
driven Hemingway to contemplate
suicide.
Hemingway Broke His Code

If there is any validity to these
assumptions—and they are held by
many more knowledgeable on the
subject than me—then it is interest-
ing to compare the Hemingway
“code” as it appears in his novels
with the way he, himself, responded
in a difficult situation. By commit-
ting suicide, Hemingway was acting
out of character with everything he
ever advocated in his novels.

Hemingway broke his own code
of “holding tight” against all odds,
all pain, all despair. Jake Barnes in
The Sun Also Rises and Frederick
Henry in Farewell to Arms are clas-
sic examples of individuals who hold
tight against the most overwhelming
of circumstances; Robert Jordon in
For Whom the Bell Tolls clings to
his ideals in the face of impossible
odds.

He Couldn't “Hold Tight”

All of these Hemingway heroes
use various opiates to keep them-
selves from becoming neurotic while
they are fighting their desperate

By LOUIS W. HODGES

The “Revolution of 63” involves
God. Both the segregationist and the
desegregationist claim company with
God. Though it has
become less pop-
ular to do so, the
- Bible is still em-
ployed in an at-
| tempt to support
_ the practice of ra-
cial segregation.
This is a particu-
larly curious use
of the book, es-
pecially since
racism itself came
into being some
2500 years after the writing of the
passages usually cited. (It is not so
curious, of course, when we note
that “The Old Time Religion” has
always been that brand of Chris-
tianity which grew up from the
revivalism of the 1730’s. We like to
give our fanciful notions status by
showing their ancient lineage, as

The Revolution of ’63

 

God A Segregationist?

though mere age were proof of
authenticity.)
Biblical Support for Segregation?
The segregationists’ two pet pas-
sages are the stories of Noah’s curse
(Gen. 9:20-27) and the Tower of
Babbel (Gen. 11:1-9). (The reader
should read these passages before
continuing.) Concerning the busi-
ness about Noah, it has been claimed
that we have here the clear in-
struction of God that the Negro is
to be separated from the white. Note
some problems with this interpreta-
tion: 1) It assumes that God made
the curse. In fact, Noah did it and
was was just out of bed from a se-
vere drunk! 2) It assumes that the
descendants of the cursed party
should be segregated. In fact, the
story maintains that they should be
“servants” or “slaves.” 3) It assumes
that the original victim was a Negro
(because of a Hebrew variation on
the word “Ham,” meaning black).
In fact, the original victim was not
Ham but Ham’s son, Canaan, whose
name in no way suggests a relation
to the Negroid race.

Real Meaning of Tower Story

Likewise, note about the Tower
story that God’s intent in dividing
men seems to be not an objection

to human unity but to human pre-
sumption, the attempt to storm
Heaven via their tower. Yet this
story is taken as evidence that God
doesn’t want men of different races
to associate with each other and
speak the same language.

In matter of plain fact, the Bible
nowhere gives support to segrega-
tion. If we are to relate God to
racial troubles—and we must—we
will consult his command that we
love our fellowmen. This would
seem to mean, if it is to mean
anything, that we are to seek the
genuine well-being of our fellow-
man. Surely we cannot work to-
ward his genuine well-being by
denying him the fullest opportunity
to develop his ability. This re-
quires, for example, the most ad-
vanced and thorough education pos-
sible. And that requires our placing
of pupils in the school where cur-
ricula makes the most of their in-
dividual talents. That, surely, will
put the better students of both
races together.

So it is that God’s command that
we love our fellows means in effect
“go to school with them.” To think
otherwise would be to believe the
preposterous nonsense that no Ne-
gro child measures up to any white.

Hampton’s African Students Pro-Castro;
OnGuard Against Western Imperialism

By ROD COCKSHUTT

One of the enlightening facets of
a recent visit which I made to
Hampton Institute was the oppor-
tunity which I had to talk at some
length with two
African students
' studying at the
| Institute this year
One of the young
men is propagan~-
F) da minister of his
party in Serra Le-
one; the other is
the son of a chief
of one of the tribes
of Rhodesia. After
spending several
hours with this
pair I can readily understand why
no one in the State Department is
really anxious to take over Soapy
Williams’ job.

Anti-Western Feeling

First of all, there was a decidedly
anti-Western flavor to a majority of
the comments these two made It
seemed that both of them were all
too willing to be on guard against
the dangers of “western imperial-
ism” and “western colonialism,” and
at the same time unwilling to see
the possibilities of a similar danger

Cockshutt

at the hands of the communist
powers. When I asked how they ex-
plained the apparent popularity of
Cuba and Communist China in so
much of Africa, the Rhodesian re-
plied that “They share with us a
common heritage of exploitation by
the West. They are most concerned
that we maintain our independence.”

The racial situation in Amercia
seemed to distress them immensely
and they both agreed ‘that the prob-
lem was doing tremendous damage
to America’s image in the eyes of
most Africans. Yet when I asked
about the situation of the white man
in their own countries I was inter-
ested to learn that both nations de-
ny citizenship to anyone whose
grandfather was not an African.
When I asked if this was not the
same kind of discrimination which
they attacked in the United States
they answered that this “grandfather
clause” was to prevent the possibili-
ty of a non-African take-over of
their governments by ambitious
white “foreigners” which they felt
would lead to the eventual reestab-
lishment of colonialism.

Nkrumah—Yes!

Finally, neither one of these young
men had enough good things to say

about President Kwame Nkrumah
of Ghana. Yes, he is going to bring
about African unity—and soon. Yes,
he is the “Redeemer” he claims to
be. Yes, he is here to establish a
“new humanity” and provide for a
new future for the downtrodden
masses of Africa who have been ex-
ploited for so many centuries. When
I asked them what it was that made
them believe all of this, my friend
from Rhodesia smiled confidently
and said, “Why he has told us so,”

Racial Situation

I think I should be quick to point
out that we cannot assume that
either of these young men speaks
for all of Africa or even for his
own country. And yet I think their
view of the situation is gaining in
popularity every day. So many of
the same sentiments are expressed
in last week’s Time magazine cover
story and in other recent articles I’ve
read,

The similarities between the situa-
tion in these emerging nations and
our own newly independent colo-
nies in the America of the 18th cen-
tury are striking. Again in history
“a terrible beauty is born.” The
question is: just how terrible, just

how beautiful. :

Freshman
Looks Back
On Semester

By BARRY VAUGHT
Freshman Columnist

Every freshman who enters
Washington and Lee comes with
some pre-determined ideas and
hopes of what the University will
be like and also what he hopes to
accomplish. I arrived with as
many ideas and aspirations as any
freshman. Since Freshman Camp
many of these have been shattered,
but also many others have taken
their places.

The first aspiration was shattered
when I met other freshmen at
camp. I was not the only one with
college boards above 400 nor had I
held any more offices than most of
them in prep school. It was frighten-
ing to think all summer, “I am going
to W&L,” and to get up here and
find 300 others who are my equals.
I also learned at camp why every-
one said I should go to Freshman
Camp, but don’t expect too much.

Rush Week brought other hopes
down despite the flattery, et al. I
was lucky to get into the fraternity
I wanted. Others were not as lucky;
and that made me wonder about the
fairness of it all, especially if you
had a good friend who had gained
the dubious title of NFU.

With classes I, along with most
other freshmen, really got the
bewildered look on my face. All
this in one semester? Then came
my first quiz—it was quite a shock
to read the questions and even more
so when I got the grade. I had
studied for it like any prep school
test, and I sorrowfully found it was
not quite enough preparation.

Then the first big weekend as
a “big college man.” All the wild
tales of W&L parties were forgot-
ten when no one dropped trow’
nor did my date jump in bed. Not
many people got drunk except the
pledges and I found I could not
hold as much whiskey as I thought
I could.

A feeling of loneliness set in after
the initial rush was over. That was
when I first called home. I did not
like to admit it all, but I missed
everything I had ever looked for-
ward to getting away from. After
this I was able to shrug it off most
of the time.

The traditions I had heard sur-
rounded life at W&L seemed mostly
to be scorned by the students, and
the hallowed tradition of beanies was
only a way for all the other students
to bother us. Conventional dress was
something new to me but after a
while it was no big thing. It seemed
like the beauty of the old buildings
faded away with cold weather, But
there seemed to still be the feeling
of beautiful oldness about the cam-
pus.

The weeks quickly went by and
then Thanksgiving with my family.
I was glad to be home, but I
would not admit, nor say that I
did not really want to return to
school. Then Christmas Vacation,
and again it was hard to leave
home, dove fields, good food, and
a car, But exams came so quickly
and studying time went so fast,
all that was only a memory. I did
not find the exams to be that much
harder than high school though
there was so much more to cover.
By the time they were over I was
so glad they were finished I gave
a very little damn how I did on
them, and I was ready for my first
Fancy Dress. Dakota  Staton’s

Handball ‘All Stars’ Issue Challenge To Faculty

As Part Il of the Tuesday’s Sports page’s series, Washington *

and Lee’s greatest unsung sports, we proudly present this week
our second “Forgotten Sport”’—Handball. With the help of the
area’s handball experts, we have picked W&L’s six outstanding
competitors in this sport to compose what we believe to be an un-
beatable All-Star team. Their story and their challenge follow in

As self-appointed captain and mouthpiece of the newly
formed Washington and Lee Handball All-Stars’ Steve ‘‘Bear-
Beatle Wig” Walsh informed the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi that
he and his five cohorts hereby issue a challenge to W&L’s
academic faculty. The All-Stars letter to the faculty (repro-
duced below) failed to mention, as the “‘Bear’’ told this reporter
later, that the term ‘academic faculty” automatically disquali-
fied any member of Washington and Lee’s coaching staff.

To whom it may concern:

antagonism by certain faculty members and as a means

All-Stars May Play Virginia

This proposed match would mean re-establishment of a
tradition which ended several years ago after the faculty, with

coaches, became so overpowering. Unlike pool, handball has |’

been encouraged by school authorities, and plans may be made,
if this All-Star team survices the faculty games, grades, and
Spring Vacation, for an inter-collegiate match with the Univer-
sity of Virginia. The All-Stars have consented to allow Bob “Big

Brother is Watching” Murray play for the faculty and many]:

feel he may be the professors’ captain. Other scholastic stal-
warts might include President Cole, who has threatened not to
play, however, unless both teams join the CAC; Dean At-
wood, originator of the “pipe smoke” method for covering
stale tobacco juice smells in the courts; and Dr. Cook, who
shuns handball gloves and hits the ball with a 1929 copy of
the Wall Street Journal.

Facing this awesome array of talent, the All-Stars are led
by Seniors “Montana”? Mike Brumby and John “‘Stumper”’
McDaniel. Brumby and McDaniel both credit the other as
being the best in school with so much modesty that the other
members of the team (Walsh, Short, and Blakeslee) feel no
need to extol their own humility. “Montana” Mike is the most
consistent member of the team, yet has missed several matches
when he strayed home to count his money. “Stumper”’ is the
most athletic member of the squad, often getting sports mixed
up (bringing his lacrosse stick to handball games or calling
football signals during matches) , however, he never loses sight
of his main objective in life—to grow three inches taller.

Walsh and Kidd Are Most Interesting

Probably the most interesting members of the team are
Walsh and Wilmot “Smitzy Squid” Kidd. It is often hard for
the players in the neighboring courts to hear due to the, shall
we say, slightly “ungentlemanly like” sounds emanating from

 

*the “Bear.” One such incident occurred when match officials
informed Walsh that it was illegal to wear an empty six-pack
carton on his head while playing, and again when his Beatle
Wig was declared illegal. Smitzy is also known for his aggres-
siveness, both on and off the handball courts and has recently
been selected the ‘Best-Liked” member of the squad. Kidd
combines his fierce competitive spirit with biting cynical humor
to wear down his opponent, and sometimes likes to ask Nir-
vana for that extra measure of luck.

The Final two members of the team, Pete ‘Boom-Boom”’
Blakeslee and Lindsay ‘Fatman’ Short are both left handed
and give the “Mutt and Jeff’? appearance to the All-Stars.

 

mone - fy Oe |

t a ele game, Pete Blakeslee (right) serves to Steve Walsh and
Lindsay Short as this trio works off the “night before.”

Blakeslee, a refugee from the squash courts, is credited as
the “cockiest” member of the squad, having lost only one
match since his sophomore year (that because someone put
glue in his gloves.) The only junior member on the W&L
Handball team is Short, and this “up and comer” is learning
his moves from Walsh, who is definitely judged as the most
agile of the courtsters. Sometimes referred to on the courts as
“Pearshape,” Short is learning to overcome his adversity to
this nickname and appears to be, with a year’s practice, next
year’s team captain.

Midfield, Attack To Be Strong

Lacrosse Outlook Brighter

By TOM CARPENTER
Tuesday Sports Writer

Prospects for a successful lacrosse season seem high for the Washing-
ton and Lee stickmen. The Generals have a good crop of returning veter-
ans and several outstanding rookies and freshmen.

The only possible weak point with respect to experience is the defense
position where the Generals were nearly wiped out by graduation. BILL
GOSSMAN is the only returnee from last year’s squad. Coach BOB Mc-
HENRY has several prospects up from the B Squad and some good recruits
from the freshman ranks. CURT JERNIGAN, JO TARTT and JIM RED-
ENBAUGH are tthe upperclassmen challenging for positions, while LANCE
BENDANN, TED LEACH, and WARREN STEWART are the freshmen
hopefuls. Stewart is being moved to defense from attack, his high school
position. Another man in consideration is BO EARNEST, on last year’s B
syual. Earnest broke his wrist in Spring football practice and will come
out for lacrosse as soon as possible.

The midfield prospects are bright with JAY BOWERSOX, PAT ROB-
ERTSON, DICK DAESNER, BUTCH WEST, and DOUG MORRISON back.
Morrison is somewhat of a question mark this season because he suffered
a severe knee injury last year. McHenry is quite hopeful that Morrison
has fully recovered. West also expects to be reserve goalie. B. squad
graduates are BILLY ANDREWS, BILL PRICE, and ED WOOD. Andrews
will also play attack. JOE HORTON is also returning at midfield position.
To top it off, Co-Captains SYD BUTLER and JOHN McDANIEL will be
holding down two of the midfield spots. It appears that McHenry is pretty
well fixed in this position.

At the attack posts McHenry has three outstanding men back from
last year in RANDY WOOTTON, MIKE MICHAELS, and CARROLL
KLINGELHOFER. These three should be able to hold their own with any
three attack men. Freshman DUNCAN LaMONTE should also see quite a

Student ‘Trainers Play I mportant
Role In University Sport Program

BY DICK DeWAUGH

Four years ago Washington and Lee’s head trainer was
forced to miss several weeks of school because of an illness,
and a student took over for him during this time. From this

evolved W&L’s present Student Varsity Trainer Organization,
an integral part of sports at W&L.*
Coach Norris Eastman, the group’s

 

elected President of the Student

advisor and supervisor, explained
today that this organization is re-
sponsible for the operation and
maintainence of the training room in
the gym, and that each student
trainer is assigned to a specific var-
sity team once a year to tape, ban-
dage and take care, generally, as
far as First Aid goes.

Members of this group must serve
a minimum of five hours a week and

bit of action this season.

Last but not least is the goalie, PETE NOONAN. Noonan did a terrific
job last year and is expected to be even better in the nets this time

around. Noonan is also a “holler guy”

and has a tendency to keep the rest

of the team hustling in seemingly lost causes. He seems to instill great

team spirit in the club.

McHenry is also pleased to see BOB HANKEY, JOHN JENNINGS, and
JOHN EDDY MOORE back out this year. Hankey, who will play attack
has the potential to be great, while Jennings and Moore will probably see

a lot of action.

Last week was an exceptionally good week of practice. The team was
blessed with good weather and put out strong effort. Coach DANA SWAN
of the B squad commented on the practice of the varsity this way. “We
are farther along than ever before at this point in preparing for the season.”
Apparently the coaching staff feels that if the weather stays warm and dry,
they will be able to finish reviewing fundamentals ahead of schedule
McHenry hopes to have the team playing as a team before the opening
game on March 26, here, against Williams College. The Generals have a
scrimmage on March 24, here, with Swarthmore as a warmup for the sea-

son’s opener.

sounding off on some issue, even if it
is contradictory to their policy. An
example of this is the solid Virginia
stand in Washington against federal
aid to education, while about 10%
of the salaries of Virginia teachers
are paid by the federal government.
The legislators know this, desire it,
yet still criticize it.
Benefits of Byrd Policies

In Virginia affairs, the Byrds dom-
inate. In McDowell’s view they have
benefited the state through improve-
ments in mental hospitals, schools,
integration problems, and govern-
ment conduct. Their greatest weak-
ness lies in the tradition of the
younger generation following, with-
out question, the policies of their
predecessors. Like all things, facets
of politics change, and so must the
politicians.

Nearing the end of his speech,
McDowell quickly delved into the
history of the organization. Be-
ginning with the birth of Sen. Byrd
in 1887, the group grew slowly
until 1925 when Byrd became gov-
ernor. Finding power, he set up the
organization which has since dom-
inated Virginia politics. Becoming a
United States Senator, Byrd sup-
ported FDR until 1932 when he
broke with his policy. Since then

 

a Moral Force. The four members
were: Arthur Brown of the Peak-
land Baptist Church in Lynchburg;
Dr. Clifford Stanley, Theologian at
Virginia Theological Seminary; Eph-
riam Fischoff, Rabbi at the Agudath
Sholom Synagogue in Lynchburg;
and Rev. John F. Cronin, S.S., As-
sistant Director of the National
Catholic Welfare Conference. Dr.
Djgenerales conducted the seminar
Man’s Potential in the Cosmos,
With Drs. Livingstone and Nisbet,
and Mr. Uviller heading the seminar
on Crime and Neurosis. The last
seminar was Business Practice vs.
Business Ethics under James duPont
of the E. I. duPont deNemours Com-
pany of Delaware, and _ Robert
Lekachmen, economist.

On Sunday, Rev. Cronin spoke on
Religion in Society in the only func-
tion of the day.

 

Byrd has not supported a democratic
presidential nominee.
Plans for future

Then, scaning the future, the col-
umnist said that he couldn’t ac-
curately forecast the Virginia polit-
ical moves, but pointed out how
the Southerners were hoping to at-
tack the Civil Rights Bill, absolve
President Johnson of any associa-
tion with it, and then mutually aid
each other in the coming elections.

(Continued from page 2)

“Thank you, thank you's” will be
hard to forget.

That Monday came too quickly
but with it came a sense of belong-
ing. I had now gotten through a
semester of college life apparently
none the worse for wear. As I look
back on it I feel I have possibly
learned how to live in this world
a little better, how to deal with peo-
ple, and how to accept things as
they are and not try to change the
world. These ideas resulted from
realizing why most things were the
way they are. The traditions are be-
ginning to mean something to me al-
though I would never admit it to
anyone. The campus seems to have,
sometimes, an air of pride about it.
And home does not mean an es-
trangement from everything I like.

Maybe after only a semester up
here I have managed to grow up
a little bit and realize what life
may be like, and I cannot think
of a better place to mature and
become somewhat educated than
here, even though I will still com-
plain about everything possible.
My dreams may have been brok-
en, but they have been replaced
with some intangible feeling I
would not trade for anything.

battles against despair. Philip Young
notes the famous passage: “Religion
is the opium of the people...and
music...and sexual intercourse...
and bread is the opium of the peo-
ple.” The crux of the problem is
that Hemingway’s code held that
men should stand tight against any
odds and reaffirm their lives. Yet
he himself was incapable of holding
tight, and took the shortest way out
of life.

This week I shall examine the
dilemma of Jake Barnes in The Sun
Also Rises, and show how Heming-
way forsook the code by which he
made Jake conduct his life. Those
who have read the novel know
that Jake had been emasculated by
a wound he suffered in the war. At
the same time, Jake loves Lady
Brett Ashley, with whom he has
become associated in the expatriate
life of Paris.

Dilemma of Jake Barnes

During the course of the novel,
Jake must watch other men take
Brett to bed—men whom he realizes
are inferior to him, and undeserv-
ing of Brett’s attention. This situa-
tion places Jake under a tremen-
dous psychological strain, and
though Brett inwardly loves Jake,
she thinks it is better to avoid talk-
ing about their feelings: “Let’s not
talk. Talking’s all bilge.” Jake could
keep himself from talking about his
love for Brett, but not from think-
ing about it.

Thinking about his wound and its
effect on his life turns Jake into an
insomniac: he once slept for six
months with all the lights on in his
room. His role in life is entirely
passive: he tries to forget his di-
lemma by going fishing, playing ten-
nis, watching bull fights, listening
to others’ problems, and at times,
getting good and drunk.

Ritual Is Important

Jake insists upon conducting the
affairs of his life with extreme care:
he buys six tickets to the bull fights
when only five are needed, just in
case an unexpected guest shows up.
Everything he does must be carried
out with proprietry and neatness.
This ritualistic code helps him to
keep going in the face of his prob-
lem. Yet Hemingway, when faced
odds comparable to those he imag-
ined for Jake, could not follow his
own code, or so it seems.

Next Week: The conclusion of this
theory, with reference to A Fare-
well to Arms, For Whom the Bell
Tolls, and “Big Two-Hearted River.”

‘WELL-KNOWN FAMOUS PEOPLE: No. 1

This is the first in a series of 48 million columns examining the
careers of men who have significantly altered the world we live
in. We begin today with Max Planck.

Max Planck (or The Pearl of the Pacific, as he is often
called) gave to modern physics the law known as Planck’s
Constant. Many people when they first hear of this law, throw
up their hands and exclaim, “Golly whiskers, this is too deep
for little old me!”

(Incidentally, speaking of whiskers, I cannot help but men-
tion Personna Stainless Steel Razor Blades, Personna is the
blade for people who can’t shave after every meal. It shaves
you closely, cleanly, and more frequently than any other
stainless steel blade on the market. The makers of Personna
have publicly declared—and do here repeat—that if Personna
Blades don’t give you more luxury shaves than any other
stainless steel blade, they will buy you whatever blade you
a9 is better. Could anything be more fair? I, for one, think
not.

But I digress. We were speaking of Planck’s Constant, which
is not, as many think, difficult to understand. It simply states
that matter sometimes behaves like waves, and waves some-
times behave like matter. To give you a homely illustration,
pick up your pencil and wave it. Your pencil, you will surely
agree, is matter—yet look at the little rascal wave! Or take
flags. Or Ann-Margret.

Planck’s Constant, uncomplicated as it is, nevertheless pro-
vided science with the key that unlocked the atom, made space
travel possible, and conquered denture slippage. Honors were
heaped upon Mr, Planck (or The City of Brotherly Love, as
he is familiarly known as). He was awarded the Nobel Prize,
the Little Brown Jug, and Disneyland. But the honor that
pleased Mr. Planck most was that plankton were named after
him.

Plankton, as we know, are the floating colonies of one-celled
animals on which fishes feed. Plankton, in their turn, feed
upon one-half celled animals called krill (named, incidentally,
after Dr. Morris Krill who invented the house cat). Krill, in
their turn, feed upon peanut butter sandwiches mostly—or,
when they are in season, cheeseburgers.

But I digress. Back to Max Planck who, it must be said,
showed no indication of his scientific genius as a youngster.
In fact, for the first six years of his life he did not speak at all
except to pound his spoon on his bowl and shout “More gruel!”
Imagine, then, the surprise of his parents when on his seventh
birthday little Max suddenly cried, “Papa! Mama! Something
is wrong with the Second Law of Thermodynamics!’ So aston-
ished were the elder Plancks that they rushed out and dug the
Kiel Canal.

Meanwhile Max, constructing a crude Petrie dish out of two
small pieces of petrie and his gruel bowl, began to experiment
with thermodynamics. By dinner time he had discovered
Planck’s Constant. Hungry but happy, he rushed to Heidelberg
University to announce his findings. He arrived, unfortunately,
during the Erich von Stroheim Sesquicentennial, and everyone
was so busy dancing and duelling that young Planck could find
nobody to listen to him. The festival, however, ended after
two years and Planck was finally able to report his discovery.

Well sir, the rest is history. Linstein gaily cried, “E equals
me squared!” Edison invented Marconi. Eli Whitney invented
Georgia Tech, and Michelangelo invented the ceiling. This
later became known as the Humboldt Current.

Mr. Shulman is, of course, joshing, but the makers of
Personna Blades are not: if, after trying our blades, you
think there’s another stainless steel blade that gives you
more luxury shaves, return the unused Personnas to Box
500, Staunton, Va., and we'll buy you a pack of any blade
vou think is better.

Cleanth Brooks |
Named Speaker |

Distinguished literary _ critic,
Cleanth Brooks, will be the speaker
at the Phi Beta Kappa convocation
on April 13 at noon. His topic will
be “American Innocence as Viewed
by Henry James, F. Scott Fitzgerald,
and William Faulkner.

The convocation, to be held in
Lee Chapel at noon on Monday, the
13th, honors the seventeen men who
were elected this month to Phi Beta
Kappa.

The name of Cleanth Brooks is
well known to Washington and Lee
students, for he is, with Robert
Penn Warren, the editor of Under-
standing Poetry, the notable text-
book that has been used for many
years in freshman English.

Brooks has been professor of Eng-
lish literature at Yale University
since 1947. For fifteen years before
that he was professor at Louisiana
State University; he has also held
visiting professorships at the uni-
versities of Texas and Southern Cal-
ifornia.

A graduate of Vanderbilt, with a
graduate degree from Tulane, he
won a Rhodes Scholarship and spent
four years in Exeter College, Ox-
ford, where he took honors and
won a B.Litt. degree. He has been
a Guggenheim Fellow, and is now
honorary consultant for the Library
of Congress.

Professor Brooks is the author of
several estimable books, among them
Modern Poetry and the Tradition,
The Well Wrought Urn, and Mod-
ern Rhetoric. With Robert Penn
he was editor of the distinguished
Southern Review, and he has contri-
buted to many literary magazines.

The convocation on April 13 at
noon, open to the public, is not
only the high point of the Phi Beta
Kappa day, but also commemorates
the generosity of the Society of the
Cincinnati to this university.

Because of its esteem for George

Grant Program
Brings 20 Here

This weekend the University is
playing host to some twenty semi-
finalists for the George F. Baker
and Robert E. Lee scholarships.

The candidates began arriving yes-
terday and planned activities started
this morning. They include confer-
ences with the Scholarship Com-
mittee, tours over the campus, and
visits to classes.

All the visitors are considered
guests of W&L, and meals and
transportation are being paid for by
the University. The candidates
are boarding at the Robert E. Lee
Hotel.

Saturday morning those applying
for the Baker Scholarships will be
interviewed by the Board of Trus-
tees Selection Committee: Mr. John
Hendon, Birmingham, Ala.;_ Dr.
John Thomas, Union Theological
Seminary; Dr. Huston St. Clair,
Tazewell, Va.

The George F. Baker Trust of
New York provides a fund for some
500 college freshmen scholarships of
varying amounts. At W&L, stipends
exists up to $1800.

There are “no limitations on the
field of study for candidates, but
it is hoped that some of the recipi-
ents may plan eventual business ca-
reers.” Emphasis is placed on lead-
ership and ability.

Five Robert E. Lee scholarships
are given, stipends range from
$1,000 to $1,800 and are open to
residents of Georgia, Kentucky,
North and South Carolina, Tennes-
see, and Virginia. “Preference is
given to students considering fields
such as teaching, public affairs,
journalism, and law.”

Seven of the prospective scholar-
ship holders are from Virginia, and
four from North Carolina.

Three men are residents of Flori-
da, two of South Carolina, an one
each of Alabama, Kentucky, and
Delaware.

the institution that had _ recently
changed its name to Washington
College, after the First President

made a gift to it. Washington’s gift,
made in 1796, was in the form of
100 shares of valuable canal stock.

There will be an initiation of new
members of Phi Beta Kappa in the
evening following the convocation.
Mr. Brooks will be present at the
initiation, and will speak informally
at the banquet that follows in Evans
Dining Hall.

The convocation in Lee Chapel
will be voluntary for the student
body, although there will be short
classes in order that the students
who wish to attend will be able to do
so.

Debaters Draw
At Tournament

Ed Fitzgerald and John McMurry
had a record of 8 wins and 8 losses
in a debate tournament at the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania last week-
end, March 13 and 14.

The tourney matched the best 28
teams in 6 states against each other
in a power-match schedule of 8
rounds of debate. All the teams de-
bated both the affirmative and the
negative sides of the question.

The Pennsylvania tournament up-
held MeMurry’s exceptional record
of never having had a losing record
in any meet, as a Washington and
Lee debater. The pair of sophomores
were facing juniors and_ seniors
who for the most part have debated
together for long periods of time.

It was the 15th tournament for
the team this year, a record num-
ber for W&L debate. Three meets
remain this spring, West Virginia,
Randolph-Macon, and NYU.

4-2 At Georgetown

Week before last (March 6 and 7)
Fitzgerald and McMurry earned
a four and two record at George-
town, another major tournament
for eastern debating.

William W. Chaffin, director of
forensics at Washington and Lee,
commented that so far this year he
has used 41 men in intercollegiate
debates, and 40 more in practice
debates on campus. This, he said, is
a record participation for the years
since he took over the debate pro-
gram.

Concerts Scheduled

The W&L Glee Club will present
two concerts next week with the
Randolph-Macon Woman’s College
Choir. The first will be held at
Smith Hall, Randolph-Macon, on
Sunday, and the second at the Lex-
ington Presbyterian Church, Tuesday
night, at eight o’clock.

The main work in both of these
concerts will be Bach’s Cantata
Number 4, “Christ Lay in Death’s
Dark Prison” also known as his
Easter Cantata. It is a difficult work,
and the Glee Club has been re-
quired to have extra rehearsals dur-
ing the past week.

The Sunday night concert, how-
ever, will also feature the Glee
Club’s regular religious songs; “With
a Voice of Singing,’ and “Alleluia
Amen,” some songs by the Ran-
dolph-Macon Choir, and “O Clap
Your Hands” by the two combined.

Lexington High Performance

For a change of pace from all the
religious music, the Glee Club put
on a concert of popular music for
Lexington High School Wednesday
afternoon. (Part of its Cultural Pro-

 

gram). This concert, held in the

 

LHS Gymnasium (which has acous-

tics comparable with Radio City
music Hall—rather unfavorably),
was a fair success, and the teen-aged
music critics in the audience re-
ceived the conecrt very favorably.

Dr. Stewart’s Work Played

A composition by Professor Rob-
ert Stewart, Glee Club director, will
be played Monday in a concert of
contemporary music at Lee Chapel.
The concert will begin at 8 p.m.

The W&L Concert Guild is spon-
soring the event, featuring three
artists and a tape recorder—which
involves the first performance of
electronic music in Lexington.

Charles Wuorinen will play Dr.
Stewart's “Five Minatures for Pi-
ano,” and his own work, “Variations
for Flute.” Joseph Marx, and Harvey
Sollberger,flute, will join Wuorinen
in the varied program of flute so-
natas, an oboe sonata, and a trio
and piano music. The music of Chou
Wen-Chung, Davidowsky, Sollber-
ger, and Wolpe will be featured in
addition to that of Wuorinen and
Stewart.

EC, Publications Board Meet Together,
Discuss ‘Collegian’; No Action Taken

By WARREN MONTGOMERY

Tuesday night the Executive Com-
mittee of the Student Body and the
W&L Publications Board met in joint
sessions to discuss Dean Atwood’s
proposal to take school subsidy away
from the Southern Collegian. No
official action was taken at this
meeting, but a straw poll taken of
the Publications Board revealed
that none of the members of this
body support Dean Atwood’s pro-
posal.

In the debate, Dick McEnally and
Tain Tompkins, respectively busi-
ness manager and editor of the
Southern Collegian, contributed the
most to the defence of the magazine.
Dean Atwood’s side was supported
by Randy Wootton, a Phi Delt sen-
ior who is not a member of the
Publications Board but was invited
to the meeting as a guest. It was
Wootton who presented the Publi-
cations Board with a list of sug-
gestions backing Dean Atwood.

Objections Rebutted

At the meeting, Dick McEnally
reviewed and replied to the objec-
tions to the Southern Collegian.
In answer to a criticism that the
Collegian is not educational, Mc-
Enally pointed out that despite the

uable training to the many writers,
cartoonists, and photographers on
the staff, the Collegian was never in-
tended to be educational. The Col-
legian was meant to be, and is, a
historical record and an outlet of
student opinion.

McEnally dealt with the criticism
that the Collegian’s “grossness” re-
flects adversely on Washington and
Lee by stating that the students are
getting what they want—“If we have
a gross magazine, we have a gross
student body.” Besides, claimed Mc-

 

Ennally, if the Collegian were cut!
off it would still reflect on W&L.

McEnally also pointed out that}
the Southern Collegian cannot be
accused of costing the school too
much because the funds that sup-
port it eome from the students,
are administered by students, and go
toward student institutions. In ad-
dition, only 30 per cent of the bud-
get of the Collegian comes from the

Wootton Makes Objections
Randy Wootton reiterated his feel-
ing that the Collegian can and
should be improved by any means
possible. He feels that cutting the
Collegian off from school support
would force the quality of content

 

fact that the magazine provides val-

 

up without posing a serious threat

to the magazine’s existence. Wootton
also suggested that the magazine
be more creative and draw _ less
material from other campus pub-
lications.

Tain Tompkins denied that the
Collegian is objectionable to many
people. He further cited the ex-
amples of Shenandoah and Ariel,
two “creative” independent student
publications which are in debt.

Several other comments were
made at the meeting. Tuesday Ring-
tum Phi Editor Roger Paine com-
mented that during his editorship

lof the Southern Collegian, he re-

ceived only one complaining letter
and that 75 per cent of the present
subscribers are girls.

In conclusion, EC President Bill
Noell declared that the EC has no
power to abolish the Southern Col-
legian because the magazine is es-
tablished by the student body con-
stitution. Only a constitutional
amendment can change the Col-
legian, said Noell, and such an
amendment would have to receive a
majority of student votes for rati-

fication even if the EC supported
the amendment. Were the EC to

deny its support to an amendment,
a two-thirds vote would be neces-

sary to pass it,

bh Kilpatrick
Makes Talk On
Property Rights

By SYDNEY LEWIS

Richmond News Leader editor,
James Jackson Kilpatrick spoke be-
fore a Lee Chapel audience Tuesday
night on the topic “1984,” which was
concerned with the future of the
United States.

' The fact that government has been
|encroaching upon human rights and
property rights dismayed Mr. Kil-
patrick. By building up a historical
argument starting before the time
of Aristotle and continuing through
the formation of our Constitution,
he demonstrated that property has
always been a primary concern of
man and that embodied in our Con-
situation are clauses which should
protect us from infringement upon
these rights.

Coercive Government

Mr. Kilpatrick continued by stat-
ing that these rights have been
reduced by a coercive government.
He cited such instances as urban
renewal projects of the government
and the new Civil Rights Bill. “The
government only has the power to
claim property for public use, not
for public benefit,” Mr. Kilpatrick
stated. He claimed that the govern-
ment, unconstitutionally, had ex-
tended its right to claim land for
public benefit and was applying this
power extensively.

The Richmond editor was not un-
aware that times are changing. He
said we are in the midst of a giant
population growth, that by 2000 A.D.
we will be living in a completely
different world: a world where each
human is assigned a giant credit
card number at birth, where longev-
ity will be greater, where communi-
cations and transportation will be
revolutionized, and where science
will combine forces with farmers to
find far more productive means of
using land.

At Springs
Five Royals Also Signed
For Rock and Roll Show

By LEWIS MILLER
Ed Croft, President of the University Dance Board, an-
nounced today that the Crystals, the Chiffons, and the Five
Royals will be featured at the Saturday night concert of Springs
Weekend. The concert will be in keeping with past weekends
in that a rock-and-roll type of music will be presented. All three

groups have achieved national fame as recording artists.
*

Along with the announcement of
the entertainment for Springs Week-
end, Steve Smith, president of the
dance weekend, announced the
theme for the two concerts. Dore-
mus Gymnasium will be decorated
to fit the theme on “Night of the
Satyr.” Jim Slay, vice-president in
charge of decorations, plans to have
the gymnasium atmosphere resem-
ble a woodlands festival. The object
of the theme is to present a cele-
bration of the deity of Pan and
Bacchus.

‘He’s So Fine’

The Chiffons burst upon the na-
tional music scene in the winter of
1963 with a tremendous explosion
which electrified the entire record
business. In a few short weeks their
recording of He’s So Fine was at the
top of the national popularity charts.
It stayed at the top for well over
a month, a long time in the days
of fast moving record hits. The re-
cording sold over a million copies.

The Chiffons continued their suc-
cess with their recording of One
Fine Day and history repeated it-
self. Today the Chiffons are rated as
one of the top female vocal groups

in the country. They are a tremen-
dous success on the concert and one
nighter show circuit.

They have a unique and instantly
identifiable sound and _ style. At
present they have recorded two
long-playing albums, both of which
have equalled the measure of suc-
cess that their single recordings did.

The Crystals

The Crystals hit the national re-
cord scene with their single record-
ing of Da Doo Ron Ron, He’s Sure
the Boy I Love, and Then He Kissed
Me. The Crystals following in the
style originated by the Shirelles,
have also seen a great amount of
success in the popular music field.

The Crystals, an older group than
the Chiffons, have at present been
travelling on the night club circuit,
playing for extended periods in
such cities as Washington, Philadel-
phia, New York (the Apollo Night
Club), and in numerous Southern
cities.

The Crystals have also had a mil-
lion selling recording, He’s Sure the
Boy I Love. In addition they have
recorded two albums and have been
one of the featured groups in two
more.

The Five Royals appeared on
campus in 1962 when they played for
the school cocktail party in Red
Square. The Royals have recorded
such hits as Think, Please, Please,
Please, and It’s Just What I Want.

The group has appeared on a
number of rock-and-roll shows over
the past few years, and have had
recordings listed in the “Top Ten”
a number of times.

The Saturday night concert will
be held in Doremus Gymnasium,

April 18, from eight to ten o'clock.

On Friday night the featured art-
ist will be Dave Brubeck, one of
the several most outstanding pro-
ponents of jazz.

IFC Fails To Ratify
M embership Proposal

At its Monday night meeting the
IFC failed to pass a proposal to
increase its membership. The de-
feated proposal called for each fra-
ternity to be represented by its
president and two elected IFC mem-
bers.

The IFC currently includes each
house president and only one elect-
ed representative from each house.
In an 11-7 vote, the proposal to in-
crease membership was backed by a
majority but failed to obtain a
needed two-thirds vote.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi
Friday Edition
Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

 

Some Flies In The Ointment

Dr Feddeman is right; the school doctor is indeed, along
with such things as dining hall food, a perennial subject of crit-
icism. This fact, though, does not automatically negate criticism
directed again the school physician, which although it has been
present on campus for years, is only now being voiced. Nor does
the criticism of the university physician rest only on “four cases
drawn from over the past six years’ mentioned in both of the
past two editions of the Ring-tum Phi. Case after case could be
presented which reflect poorly on the university doctor as a
physician. If the record were to be examined there is no doubt
that the results would prove that criticism has not “been blown
all out of proportion,” as the Tuesday edition claims. So far
it has been modest.

But even without rushing into charges of ‘incompetence’
and listing cases, elements of the infirmary situation can be
pointed out which seriously need improvement.

In the first place, the university doctor is too hard to see
during the short time he is in his campus office. He is only
there for a couple of hours each morning, and if a student has
classes during these hours, he just can’t see the doctor. The
physician doesn’t arrive at his office until about 9:00, and if a
man has an 8:25 class, it is perfectly impossible for him to get
an excuse from the doctor for this class—since, according to
Absence Regulations, “a student must report to the medical
office preceding any class he may miss in order to obtain a medi-
cal excuse.” This means that the man either goes to class sick,
or he must take the chance that the doctor will give him an
excuse once he arrives at the infirmary. The Absence Regu-
lations are set by the faculty, it is true, and so the school doctor
cannot correct this situation; unless he chooses to come to work
a little earlier.

This leads up to the second point: it is truly “taking a
chance” to count on getting an excuse from the school doctor,
because he seems to assume the attitude that a student is
healthy until proven sick—by himself. In other words, he
treats the entire college population as if it were a grade school
class trying to get out of school for a day by feigning an upset
stomach. Contrary to infirmary opinion, college students do
not stay up nights plotting tricks to put over on the college
doctor. On the contrary, they pay for the privilege of classes,
and they realize that their education depends on good use of
class time.

Third, it is the position of the other doctors in Lexington,
that the university physician is the “family doctor’ of the
W&L student body; that is, there is an idea that every W&L
student is a patient of the school doctor, and therefore no
other doctor in town dares to treat a student—out of respect
for A.M.A. ethics. If a student goes to the hospital he is told
that “only the school doctor” can handle his case. Yet he is
obviously not the physician of every student’s choice, and so
this misconception should be disregarded. If a student feels
that the service provided by the university is less than the best
available, he should be able to go to any physician in Lexing-
ton, and do so without permission from the infirmary.

Finally, why is the infirmary staff so anxious to call a
pharmacy and give a student a prescription every time he’s
sick—at the student’s expense? Why can’t the infirmary pro-
vide medicine? Or just what does the “infirmary fee” paid by
every student go to buy? If it is used to provide the present
degree of infirmary service, there are probably a few students
who would rather use their money for medicine than for the
service.

The object of this editorial is not to question “Dr. Fedde-
man’s so-called incompetence,” as the Tuesday edition so
aptly puts it. Actually, most residents of Lexington recognize
him as one of Lexington’s leading obstetricians. His patients
speak very highly of him, and so he is due every respect.
Nevertheless, it seems that he can do a much better job in the
infirmary, both in his treatment of students and in the rules
by which the infirmary is run.

able farce. The color is badly done;
this would have been better in black

total loss, another Brando effort that
bungled. The dialogue might appear
subtle to an eight-year old, especial-
ly the enthralling moment when
Brando screams, “you scum-sucking

This one is strictly for townies. The

not seen this but critical reaction
has been very favorable.

God Is Dead --- Part One

 

Gospels As Ultimate Truth Refuted

One of the cardinal virtues in
the career of college students is
the quest for truth. This ideal is
particularly vital to a_ society
whose bannerhead is Progress and
Achievement. But truth, if un-
challenged, will have no stimulus
for growth.

For this reason, we extol the
cynic, the common man's gadfly.
It is for this reason also that we
ourselves shall assume the role of
the cynic, with the ulterior motive
of promoting truth. The role we
are presently undertaking is that
of a Devil's Advocate to an in-
stitution which, because of its ex-
treme conservatism, its inability to
adjust to a changing society, has
made of “truth” mere blind dog-
ma. We refer, of course, to the
Christian Church and the sort of
faith it professes persistently to
a no longer gullible society. Be-
low, in our first of a series, we
shall assault one of the corner-
stones of the Christian Church
dogma—the New Testament.

By KEN LANE
Editor-in-Chief

The New Testament as it exists
today is a miscellaneous collection
of historical records and theological
speculation. That it has become an
ultimate authority within the Church
is about to develop into an Achil-
les’ heel for all of modern Christian-
dom. What is making the Church
weaker in this respect is that schol-
ars, through advanced technology,
are discovering more and more
about this best-seller document, and
the more they discover about it,
the more it loses any aura of au-
thenticity.

The haphazard way in which the
content of the New Testament was
assembled and passed down from
eentury to century is enough to
shake one’s faith. First of all, it is
improbable that any of the Gospel-
writers ever saw the main Charac-
ter of the respective narratives; at
the most, they relied simply on sur-
viving testimonies and memoirs of
the original Twelve. The Gospel of
Mark, which was the primary source
of the Gospels of Matthew and Luke,
was written around 70 A.D. Many
feel that much of the material in-
corporated in this book was dic-
tated by the Apostle Peter. Luke
was written between 70 and 80 A.D.;
Matthew around 90 A.D. It is vir
tually impossible that the latter was
written by the Apostle Matthew;
assuming that he had been born
earlier than Christ, Matthew would
probably have exceeded one hun-
dred years old by the time of his
alleged authorship. The date of the
Gospel of John has been set some-
time after 100 A.D. and obviously
could not have been written by the
apostle.

Countless Inconsistencies

Partly because they were written
so long after the time of Christ
by persons with little or no first-
hand experience, the Gospels man-
ifest countless contradictions and in-
consistencies. A study of the surviv-
ing manuscripts of the New Testa-
ment reveals nearly 175,000 discrep-
ancies. Though mainly of minor sig-
nificance, some of these disagree-
ments are glaring. The reports of
the Sermon on the Mount, in Mat-
thew and Luke, are in many places
outright contradictions. Matthew,
Luke and John differ hopelessly
about the anointing of Jesus, both
as to the time and place. Matthew
and Mark tell one story of the trial
of Jesus; Luke tells a second; John
tells a third. Even the accounts
of such critical events as the Cruci-
fixion and the Resurrection radi-
cally disagree.

One matter that seriously detracts
from the authenticity of the New
Testament is the great amount of
tampering of scriptural passages by
early scholars of the Church. Con-
sequently, many doctrines im-
plicit in the modern-day Gospels
were most probably unknown to
Christ himself.

Inserted “Truths”

The doctrine of the Trinity, for
example finds little Biblical substan-
tiation except through interpolations
made by scholars in copying orig-
inal texts. One of the key verses
that allude to this doctrine is Christ’s
statement in Matthew: “Go ye
therefore, and teach all nations,
baptizing them in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost.” However, neither
Mark (which was the principle
source of Matthew) nor Luke make
any mention of this statement, and
in the Acts of the Apostles baptism
is performed in the name of Jesus
alone. More than likely, some the-
ologian added the verse at some
time after the Church had begun
to accept the Trinitarian doctrine.

 

Yum Tree (a phallic title par ex- |

Another interpolated verse is the| left are the snake-charmers in the

mandate which Mark ascribes
Christ as: “Go ye into the world,
and preach the gospel to every crea-
ture’—a command that has served
as a key impetus to the church’s mis-
sionary efforts. This verse is missing
from most of the early texts; Luke
and Matthew make no mention of it,
although both had used Mark as a
chief source. The verses immediately
following were also probably in-
serted long after the original text.
These contain Christ’s description
of the true believers: “in my name
they will cast out demons; they will
speak in new tongues; they will pick
up serpents, and if they drink any
deadly thing, it will not hurt them;
they will lay their hands on the
sick, and they will recover (by these

criteria, the only true Christians

 

to| back hills of Tennessee!).

A Triumph for Christ

The most disillusioning inconsis-
tencies of the Gospel involves the
portrayal of Christ himself. Each
of the authors presents a Messiah
that in certain ways is distinct from
any of the others. For example, while
Mark presents a somewhat human-
ist Christ, that in Matthew and Luke
is especially mystical. Even more
upsetting, however, is the schizo-
phrenic Christ, who one day is meek
and compassionate, the next, bitter
and high-strung. One story that il-
lustrates the latter side of this per-
sonality is that of Christ and the
Gadarene. Christ and his disciples
had disembarked on one of the re-
mote shores of the Sea of Galilee.
On ascending the lofty cliffs, they
encountered a hermit named Legion,

 

so called because he was possessed
with thousands of demons. Christ
and these demons engaged in a
somewhat spirited dispute. Christ
got the better of his antagonists by
casting them all into the numerous
swine that grazed nearby. Seized of
these spirits, the beasts stampeded
over the cliffs and drowned in the
sea below. This for the people of
Gadarene meant the loss of their
chief means of livelihood; they were
unimpressed by Christ’s show of
power and invited the Messiah and
his disciples to leave. For the town
of Gadarene, it had been a day of
irrevocable loss. For the disciples,
it had been a day of triumph and
its recording became a part of
the Inspired Word!

Medicine’s Deficiencies Evident;
Socialism Might Be The Answer

By SYD LEWIS

Americans must be willing to face
the medical problems of the twen-
tieth century with an open mind.
Certainly, the national security and
well being of the country is depend-
ent to some degree on the health
of the nation.

Nevertheless, no matter what your
doctor or the A.M.A. might tell you,
the United States is undoubtedly
not the healthiest nation in the
world. It is appalling to hear that
the death rates among infants in
the United States is 28 per thousand
while in Finland (21 per 1,000) and
in four other Western nations the
figure is lower than ours. The death
rates among infants under one year
of age in the U.S. (27 per 1,000) is
not up to par compared with such
countries as Sweden (17 per 1,000),
the Netherlands, Switzerland, and
the United Kingdom. The death rate
from whooping cough, an easily con-
trolable sickness if the patient re-
ceives proper medical attention in
time, is twice that of Sweden’s.
With the development of antibiotics,
there is no reason why the death
rate from pneumonia in the United
States should not be the lowest in
the world, for we have the wealth
to purchase and distribute these
drugs; however, Denmark only has
two-thirds as many deaths from
this disease. Finally, the actual death
rate is higher in the United States
than in Canada, Norway, the Neth-
erlands, and Finland—that is, life
expectency is not highest in the
US.

U.S. Behind in Research

Furthermore, the United States is
not the leader in all fields of medical
research; yet with a gross national
product of almost $600,000,000,000,
we certainly have the capacity to
build the necessary laboratories if
able men can be convinced to enter
research. France (bacteriology),
England (anti-septic surgery), Ger-
many (chemotherapy), and Czecho-
slovakia (blood typing) are ex-
amples of countries which have
equalled or surpassed America in
certain fields.

American medicine has also failed
to produce enough physicians to fill
our growing needs. The A.M.A. esti-
mates (probably overstimates) that
there is one physician for every 750
residents of the U.S. while Iseral has

LETTERS

EpiroR

I have been encouraged by the
recent appearance of an issue which
promises to awaken the campus from
its listless apathy. There are two
reasons for my optimism over the
discussion of desegregation: first, the
issue threatens to foree W&L out
of its intellectual sterility and cre-
ate from the resulting maturity a
truly intellectual atmosphere where
ideas and issues of universal and
lasting importance, such as race re-
lations, morals, and politics, ean be
debated rationally. Secondly, I am
strongly in favor of desegregation
of W&L and consequently weleome
this open discussion which can only
benefit all those concerned.

But let us be alerted to the real
issue, let us immerse ourselves in
its technicalities and its conse-
quences. For the numerous pale
Dick Gregorys who rationalize
their prejudiced views and stereo-
types under an attempted veneer
of humor have no place in the dis-

one physician per 467 residents.
State mental hospitals have stated
they need 3,700 more doctors. At
one time 5,091 of 25,616 A.M.A. ap-
proved hospital residences were va-
cant, and at the same time 2,010
of 11,616 A.M.A. approved intern-
ship positions were without doctors.
Approximately 37,000,000 Ameri-
cans are without local health de-
partments. Many believe that the
A.M.A., the powerful doctor’s “labor
union,” has played an important part
in creating this deficiency through
trying to keep the pay up by keep-
ing supply down.

The A.M.A, asserts that our type
of medicine is the best (earlier
paragraphs have discounted this)
because of the freedom of choice
of doctor and the patient-doctor
relationship. But how effective is
one’s choice of doctor? There is
no guide. Most choices are made
by recommendation, tradition, or
by merely running one’s finger
through the telephone book.

Furthermore, doctors have been
criticized for their dollar doctrine.
Most doctors are not predominant-
ly money-conscious; however, it is
the doctrine of the A.M.A. to charge
according to one’s ability to pay.
How would students like it if they
were charged extra for beers be-
cause they had more ability to pay
than a townie? Why then should
we allow doctors to use their mon-

 

opolistic powers in a similar way?
Americans are protected from mono-
polistic businesses; they need to be
protected from doctors!

Is Socialism an Ancwer?

What is the answer to the medical
question? Socialism? We certainly
do not claim to know the answer.
We do know that more doctors must
be produced—we need more medi-
cal schools. Men of ability must not
be scored away from medicine be-
cause of the cost of education. Sal-
aries of research positions must be
increased to induce men to follow
this field. Patients must be pro-
tected from unfair fees and prac-
tices. We as citizens have a right
to some control over doctors—our
investments in physicians is hugh.
Thirteen billion dollars ($70,000 per
doctor) is invested in public hos-
pitals alone.

Socialism, of course, is an an-
swer to the problem. Many claim
that this means has been highly
successful in Great Britain. If the
A.M.A. does no solve their own
deficiences in medicine, I am sure
that the American public will
awaken to the fact that social ac-
tion must be taken.

H ell- Raisers Were Here 'To Learn;
Yet They Also Had Fun Doing It

By DREW BAUR
Friday Columnist

The editorial in the Tuesday edi-

tion is worthy of some further com-

ments. There will

' shall disregard

1 this article as nos-

talgic thoughts of

the “good old

days.” However,

it would be wrong

to dismiss this as

mere reverie, be-

eause unfortun-
ately it is true.

The men of the
“good old days”
article said, fiercely
school and their fra-
ternity. They were proud of their
football team, proud of the “cutting
up” of the Minks, 13 Club, and White
Friars. This was the other side of
their education, but nevertheless a
side,

The Gulicks, Scharnbergs, Suss-
mans, and Sparks were a hangover
of other times. They added a zest
and liveliness to Washington and
Lee that cannot be replaced by long

were, as the
loyal to their

 

hair and snobbery. They were here
to learn, but to have fun doing it.

No one questions now (and I
doubt that they ever did question)
that a college is for academic pur-
suits. Apparently, there is now a
strong trend at W&L to produce
the academic wizard, rather than
the “all-around man,” Yet, per-
haps there is something else to
college besides a 3.0, though God
help anyone around here who
dares suggest such a thing.

This is not a call for riotous rev-
elry, but merely a suggestion that
maybe we ought to take ourselves
less seriously. End of sermon.

In a few weeks the new IFC rush
proposals will go before the houses
for approval. The tremendous
amount of time and effort which the
committee on Rush Week put in on
these proposals demands a careful
consideration of them by every
member of every fraternity.

I-M Week

 

Phi Kap Wins Meet;
Takes 7 of 16 Events

By TOM WHITE

Rich Hartgrove (three firsts) and
John Laimbeer (two first) led Phi
Kappa Sig to the 1964 intramural
track and field championship Tues-
day afternoon.

In rolling to first place, the Phi
Kaps piled up 124 points, 64 more
than second place Lambda Chi. They
placed at least one person among
the top five finishers in each event
but the pole vault.

All in all, it was a good week
for the Phi Kaps, who added a first
in table tennis and a second in
bowling, won by Kappa Sig. This
combined toe give a tremendous
boost to Pi Kappa Sig’s chances
at the intramural championship.

Hartgrove led them in the track
meet with 30 points on firsts in
the triple jump, high jump and
broad jump. Laimbeer, winner last
fall of the Turkey Trot, captured
first place in both the mile and
880.

Gasque Nears Record

Phi Gam’s Gay Gasque was the
meet’s only other double winner. He
outelassed the opposition in both
the shot put and discus, adding a
fifth place finish in the javelin.

Gasque’s 43’ 914” shot put ap-
proaches the school mark of 45’ 8”
set in 1957 by A. B. Platt.

Other notable individual perform-
ances were recorded by Lambda
Chi’s Bob Bigham (first in the 440,
second in the 220) and Phi Kappa
Sig’s Bob Phillips (second in the
triple jump, third in the broad
jump).

Delt, SAE and Beta bunched to-
gether to round out the top five
finishers. The team scores: 1. Phi
Kappa Sig, 124; 2. Lambda Chi, 60;
3. Delt, 52-4. SAE, Si; 5. Beta, 47;
6. Sigma Chi, 33; 7. Sigma Nu, 24;
8. Phi Gam, 22; 9. ZBT, 20; 10. KA,
18; 11. Phi Psi, 16; 12. PiKA, 9; 13.
DU 8; 14. PEP, 7; 15. NFU, 4. Kappa
Sig and SPE, the only other entrants,
failed to score.

When participation points were
added, Delt and SAE both moved
up a notch, dropping Lambda Chi
to fourth, KA jumped from tenth
to fifth.

mages pitting the attack and defensive specialists of both teams

against each other. Tuesday at 3:15 p.m. there will be a full
*scale scrimmage.

Coach Bob McHenry will be tak-
ing a team into this game which,
while it has remarkablly more depth
and talent that W&L lacrosse teams
are accustomed to having, still has
problems at both the defensive and
attack positions.

Randy Wootton’s achilles tendon
injury and Bob Hankey’s pulled leg
muscle place them both on the
doubtful list, seriously hampering
the attack game. Goalie Pete Noonan
has been slowed by a knee injury,
but will probably start against
Swarthmore.

Midfield Strongest

Midfield appears to be McHenry’s
strongest position. Instead of the
old W&L five man rotation system,
the team’s weakest point in recent
seasons, McHenry now has three
solid and comparatively equal mid-
fields to work with. The added depth
should be the team’s greatest asset
this season.

Last year W&L defeated Swarth-
more in in pre-season scrimmage,
9-3, but this year could be a differ-
ent story. Swarthmore has virtually
the same team back and has added
some excellent freshmen prospects,
notably at attack.

McHenry sees the game as a good
testing ground for his various units,
and as a chance to develop their
team play. It should also help
settle the remaining contests for
team positions.

Baseball Team
To Play VMI

In Scrimmages

Two weekend scrimmage games
with Virginia Military should set
the Washington and Lee baseball
team for the annual spring jaunt.

The Generals meet VMI on Smith
field both Saturday and Sunday at
3 p.m,

Two fielding positions and the
pitching staff are still in question as
the team prepares for its trip, which
will begin next Saturday at Pfeiffer
College in North Carolina.

Coach Joe Lyles will take 23 tol].
25 of his 30-man team on the trip.

Two Men Injured

The status of Earl McGowin, the
right-handed pitcher with an in-
jured shoulder, is still uncertain. He
will see a Lynchburg specialist this
weekend. Tom Crenshaw, a VMI
transfer and Lyles’ number one
eatcher, is also nursing a sore arm.

Chris Wigert and Brice Gamber,
a pair of southpaws, are thus far
the only sure spots on the pitching
staff. Freshman Roy Powell heads
a group of right-handers that in-
cludes Terry Herman, Pete Heu-
mann and Scott Lavery.

First base and center field are
the other positions where the start-
ers are uncertain. At first, Jim
Crothers and Skip Chase are vying
for the position left by Howard
Martin, who will not play this year.

Either of two freshmen, Gene
Gillespie or Scott Miller, will play
center. Elsewhere in the outfield,
Pete Candler will be in left, Ashley
Allen in right.

In the infield, Lou Flannagan
will start at second, Lou Paterno at
third, and Dave Kirkpatrick at
shortstop.

Picture Changes

Lyles said that with only two reg-
ulars graduating he had thought the
team would be in good shape. Then
Eric Sisler, a .400 hitter, and Bob
Taylor flunked out, and Martin and
Doug Davis decided not to play.
W&L will probably have trouble
reaching .500.

The full schedule: Mar. 26: Buck-
nell, Mar. 28: at Pfeiffer, Mar. 30, 31
and April 1: at Fort Bragg, April
2: at Frederick, April 3: at Old Do-
minion, April 4: at Fort Lee, April

RIFLE TEAM PLACES 29th

The Washington and Lee Rifle

Poor Warren Spahn. He’s got
problems. He may not have incen-
tive after this
year. The Mil-
waukee Braves’
southpaw has won
350 games, just
shy of the Nation-
al League record
of 373, shared by
Christy Mathew-
son and Grover
Cleveland Alex-
ander.

If he repeats his
23-victory total of
last season he can
tie the record. But that could be bad.

Spahn says, “If I don’t have any-
thing to shoot for, I get sort of an
empty feeling. A guy’s got to have
a challenge to keep going.”

Sonny Liston, recently dethroned
heavyweight boxing champ, will be
back in court June 9 after failing
to show in Denver Municipal Court
earlier this week.

Liston, charged with speeding,
careless and reckless driving, driv-
ing without a license and carry-
ing a concealed weapon, wanted
a jury trial.

Attorney Donald L. Lozow enter-
ed a plea of innocent for the absent
Liston.

Portland, Ore. may be the next
city to have a domed stadium. Base-
ball’s Houston Colts are already
scheduled to play beneath one in
1965.

The dome would be 1,000 feet
in diameter, rising 300 feet above
the playing field. Seating capaci-
ty—46,730.

The cost for such a worthwhile
structure is estimated at a paltry
$23,500,000. So far no one has come
up with any ideas on how to raise
the money.

a * *

Charles Goren, in his recent
Sports Illustrated series, offered some
advice from George S. Kaufman on
playing winning bridge.

“It was George who pointed out
that you could always hold good
cards merely by sitting South. He
said, ‘No matter who writes the
books or articles, South holds the
most terrific cards I ever saw.
There is a lucky fellow if I ever
saw one.’

“Ever since then I have sat South.
That is the secret of my success.”

Aspiring Gorens should note this
bit of wisdom.

ZBT Takes Second

Phi Kappa Sig won their second
championship Tuesday night, defeat-
ing ZBT in table tennis. The Phi
Kaps had earlier beaten Sigma Nu
5-0 and DU 3-2.

ZBT settled for second, on the
strength of a 3-2 decision of DU
and a forfeit win over Sigma Nu,
who also forfeited to DU, giving
them third place in the tournament.

Kappa Sig ruined Phi Kappa Sig’s
bid for a third intramural title in
one day when they beat them 2396-
2184 in bowling that same evening.

Jim Bussart rolled high game, a
204, for the Phi Kaps, but it wasn’t
enough to overcome Kappa Sig’s
high scoring duo of Tom Pace and
Steve Thompson, who bowled re-
spective 536 and 533 series.

With John Heinzerling bowling a
214, and Joe Wheeler a 198, SAE
took third place, downing Phi Psi
2154-1906.

Volleyball began last night, with
Phi Gam the defending school

Dr. Fiedler
Speaks Here
Tomorrow

One of Montana State Universi-
ty’s leading professors will speak
here tomorrow, Wednesday, March
25:

Leslie A. Fiedler, professor of
English Literature and Director of
Humanities, will lecture on “The!
Image of the Negro and Indian in}
American Literature” at 8 p.m. in|
duPont Auditorium.

 

His appearance, sponsored by the}
English Department and Seminars
in Literature, was arranged by the
University Center in Virginia.

The Seminars in Literature, found-
ed in 1952, bring to the campus
outstanding figures in the field of
creative writing, criticism, and
teaching.

Dr. Fiedler received his B.A. de-
gree from New York University,
and his M.A. and Ph.D. from the
University of Wisconsin. He did
post-doctoral work at Harvard and
was a student at the Japanese Lan-
guage School (University of Colo- |
rado).

A member of Montana State Uni-
versity’s staff since 1941, Dr. Fiedler
served a two-year term as Chair-
man of the English Department and
has been Director of the Humanities
Course since 1948. During leaves he
has taught at the Universities of
Bologna, Rome, Venice, Athens, and
Princeton.

He has held a Rockefeller Follow-
ship, two Fulbright Fellowships, the
Kenyon Review Fellowship in Criti-
cisms and the Christian Gauss Fel-
lowship at Princeton University in
1956.

He has been awarded the Furioso
Poetry Prize and the award from the
National Institute of Arts and Let-
ters for “excellence in creative writ-
ing.”

Along with contributing to many
periodicals, he is the author of An
End to Innocence: Essays on Culture
and Politics, The Art of the Essay,
and Love and Death in the American
Novel.

UCA Initiates
Committee For

Social Affairs

Under the auspices of the Univer-
sity Christian Association, the UCA
Committee for Christian Social Con-
cerns was recently established and
organized. On Thursday, March 12,
it held its first meeting with Bob
Potts as chairman.

The committee, consisting of 25
members, was organized to become
better acquainted with social and
racial problems encountered in the
local area, especially in Lexington
itself. Further plans call for its
participation in community efforts
such as the aiding of the Lexing-
ton Voters League.

The committee was the brainchild
of several students who attended a
conference at Haverford Collegge a
month ago. At that conference they
came in contact with members of
similargroups from campuses
throughout the East. Most of the
sucommittees aided in local activi-
ties, but others, such as at the
University of Virginia, picketted
on their own initiative a segregated
restaurant,

Upon their return to W&L, it was
decided to form a cimilar, but smal-
lerand more moderate group that
would primarily observe local prob-
lems and participate in local action.
Dr. Louis Hodges carefully pointed
out that this committee would not
initiate any boycotts nor agitate for
integration of Washington and Lee.

The committee is helping with the
current voter registration drive. To-
night and Thursday there will be
workshops in the Lexington Town
Hall to train interested students and
townsfolk. Dr. Louis Hodges will
lead one workshop.

‘Every Student A Participant’

 

Editor’s Note: The following is
a statement by the Steering Com-
mittee of the Mock Convention,

Since last June, the state chair-
men and members of the steering
committee have been laying the
groundwork for the Washington and
Lee Mock Republican Convention.
To ensure that sufficient preparation
is being made, they have contacted
politicians in Washington, party
workers all over the country, pro-
fessional parade planners, and
friends of W&L in many areas and
professions.

This work has proven to be very
fruitful, and the convention up to
this point is a success. Whether or
not this will continue, whether the
convention will maintain its fine rec-
ord of accuracy over the past half-

century, depends on the individual!

efforts of each student who will
now be asked to give of his time
and enthusiasm in the final prepara-
tion for the convention and in the
two days it is held. What the Mock
Convention will mean to every stu-
dent depends on this same thing: the
cooperation each student contrib-
utes.

It is perhaps difficult to realize
the feeling of esteem in which our
Mock Convention is held in po-
litical circles. Politicians actually
do follow W&L’s Mock Conven-
tion with keen interest. Its guest
list is long and distinguished, and
it is good evidence of the fact
That the Republican Party is
watching the convention,

No other Mock Convention can
boast of a comparable group
guests—including congressmen, par-
ty officials, the keynote speaker of
the last Republican National Con-
vention, and the beauty queens of
several states. The news media also
hold the convention in high regard;
it has received national magazine
and television coverage in the past
and the steering committee has high
hopes of expanding this coverage
this year.

The highest compliment paid
to the Mock Convention to date
may have come from James Wells,
Gov. Rockefeller’s New York
chairman, when he said that the
Washington and Lee Mock Con-
vention was the third most impor-
tant victory needed by Rockefeller,
following two state primaries.

Every student of the University
is in some way a participant in
the convention. Assistant chairmen,
secretaries, float chairmen, nomi-
nation speakers, campaign managers,
fund raisers, clerks and many other
capacities are needed to produce the
magnificent show that the conven-
tion will be. Besides these specific
jobs, each student is asked to become
a political analyst, to keep abreast of
the news, to take issue wtih the ex-
perts in expression of his own
opinion,

 

Mock Convention Is Assessed |

The 53-state and territory dele-
gations will hold meetings to dis-
cuss the field of candidates and
their varying strengths, and every
member of the delegations must
help his state arrive at a correct
stand if the convention’s accuracy
is to continue. It is not the job
of the state chairman to determine
alone how his state will vote—this
is the privilege of his delegation
to determine.

Each student is also asked to
serve in public relations, to publi-
cize the convention by telling his

 

 

parents friends, and anyone in the
news media to whom he may
have access. In sum, the students are
being asked to give their best indi-
vidiual talents in particular tasks.
The colorfulness of a state delega-
tion, the originality of a float, the
convention rallies and the balloting,
all hinge on the efforts and the
enthusiasm of the delegation mem-
bers.

In these contributions, the light
side of the Mock Convention will
also be brought out. The Parade

Examination Schedule
May 23, 1964 through June 2, 1964

It is the responsibilty of each student to know the time and place of
meeting of each of his examinations. The hours for examinations are 9:00-
12:00 and 2:00-5:00. Any student more than five minutes late must present
a satisfactory reason for his lateness to be allowed to take the examina-

tion.

The omission by a student of any regular examination causes him to for-
feit his place in the class and to receive grade F for the semester, unless he
is excused for reasons deemed sufficient by the Dean and instructor con-

C. W. Turner

To Publish Text

On Western U.S.

Dr. Charles W. Turner, Professor
of History at Washington and Lee,
recently submitted his manuscript
of a new history text to Garrett
and Masey Publishers in Richmond.

The text is designed for college
studying western United

courses
States in the 19th and 20th cen-

turies. Throughout the book, Dr.
Turner keeps sight of the Webb and
Turner theses of the development of

the West, and points out valuable
criticism relative to both.

Scheduled to be published in the

fall, the new text will consist of
approximately 450 pages and 34
chapters. The Western life during
these times include the American
land policy, conservation, oil, rail-
roads, the new states of Hawaii and
Alaska, the Civil War in the West,
the Indians, and the gold rush.
Dr. Turner started his research in
1954 at the University of Minnesota
and received several Glenn Grants
which permitted him to spend a few
summers at the University of Cali-
fornia at Berkeley.

Other works of Dr. Turner in-
clude Chessie’s Road, the story of

the Chesapeake and Ohio, and 40
articles printed by various journals

such as American Economic History
and The Journal of Southern His-
tory.

Rod Cockshutt
To Lead JFK
Library Group

 

Rod Cockshutt, a senior here, has
been chosen chairman of the Ken-
nedy Library Committee to direct
the drive on this campus for a

memorial library to the late presi-
dent.

The proposed $10 million library
will be constructed in Boston. The
national committee will coordinate
drives in late April on 2,100 campus-
es throughout the nation as their
part in the public campaign to raise
the necessary funds.

According to the Corporation an-
nouncement, the Institute of the
Library will further one of Presi-
dent Kennedy’s deepest concerns—
his continuing attempt to bring to-
gether the world of ideas and the
world of affairs; the world of schol-
arship and the world of decision.

Program of Institute

The Institute will strive to bring
intellectual and public affairs closer
together in a diversity of ways—
through lectures and seminars by
professors, politicians and _ public
servants of all parties and from
foreign countries; through profes-
sional chairs; through meeting
rooms for undergradutes interested
in politics and public affairs; through
fellowships for scholars, American
and foreign; through visitors-in-
residence; through organization of
study groups and_ conferences
bringing together scholars and prac-
titioners to consider vital issues;
through a publication program;
through literary and public service
awards; and through a variety of
other means.

Any students interested in par-
ticipating in this drive should con-

tact Rod Cockshutt at HO 3-2335, or
| at Post Office Box 311.

*ing committee for the wekend, and
he has selected the name “Con-
tact” for the event. Contact will be
for the benefit of all Washington
and Lee students, and will be a
result of close cooperation between
the Faculty, the Administration, and
the student leaders of the program.

Brownell, a junior Kappa Sig from
Birmingham, Ala. is currently chair-
man of the Alabama Delegation of
the Mock Convention. He is a
Dean’s List student, a Robert E.
Lee Research Scholar, an officer in
his fraternity, and he plays bass
guitar for Sabers and Sensations
combo.

Quekemeyer To Assist

Henry Quekemeyer, a Delt from
Roanoke, Va., has ben appointed
assistant chairman of Contact. A
freshman, Phil Claxton, has been
appointed special assistant to Brown-
ell. Quekemeyer is an Honor Roll
student, a dorm counselor, and an
officer in his fraternity.

The theme chosen for the first
Contact is The American Experience,
and Its Implications for the Indi-
vidual Citizen, the American Na-
tion, and the World. The elaboration
of such a broad topic can be made
along historical, political, economic,
sociological, religious, and scienti-
fic lines.

Broad Scope Intentional

The purpose of Contact is to offer
varying viewpoints and approaches
to an overall intellectual problem.
It is felt that the proposed theme
will offer the widest possible appeal
to all members of the student body
and surrounding colleges, both in its
particular aspects and from the
standpoint of the conference as a
whole.

The tentative plans for the Con-
ference are for a series of lectures
and seminars conducted by a num-
ber of outstanding speakers. The
Chairman has expressed a desire to
get half of the speakers from the
ranks of those who are nationally
known, and even controversial. The
other half he hopes to take from
the ranks of those that are lesser
known popularly but are experts
in their respective fields.

The advantage of such an exten-
sive program of lectures and semi-
nars of this type, all directed to-
ward a certain unity, is that it is
more impressive and more valuable
than numerous unconnected indi-
vidual lectures.

Financing of Weekend

The Conference will largely be
financed through national corpora-
tions, national foundations, interest-
ed individuals, and possible aid
from the Faculty Committee on Lec-
tures by their coordinating of sev-
eral of their speakers with the Con-
ference weekend.

Anyone wishing to apply for a po-
sition on the staff of the Conference,
and any one wishing to contribute
suggestions about the Conference,
may address their letters to Blaine
Brownwell, P. O. Box 6.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Tuesday Edition
Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

Trash —Unexpurgated!

Filth, anyone?

Erotic smut scenes, replete with vivid drawings of
copulation, oral-genital contact, and every imaginable il-
lustration of the instruments of l’amour?

Pornographic poetry, chock full of all your favorite
four letter words, describing in lucid detail everything
bodily from orgasms to bowel movements?

You needn’t look far—it’s all right here on campus.

And we aren’t talking about the latest issue of The
Southern Collegian or a Ring-tum Phi feature—both of
which have come under fire recently for their “porno-
graphic” content.

No. We’re talking about the dazzling doodles that
decorate half the desks at W&L.

Futhermore, we don’t think it’s funny—but we do
think it’s ironic, considering the recent comments about
the college humor magazine and a particular article in the
Tuesday Ring-tum Phi.

We should like to suggest that a situation meriting
much greater attention is the asinine artistry that seems
to be a favorite pastime of some members of the stu-
dent body. We know of classrooms in Howe Hall, Rob-
inson, and Newcomb, at least, where desks have been
covered with every describable kind of lewdness.

None of these are the least bit witty or amusing—
they’re just dirty, in the same way that bathroom writings
of little boys are dirty.

We wonder why Washington and Lee gentlemen
would waste their time and minds committing such smut
to posterity. We shudder to think of the reaction of par-
ents, guests, or dates who, visiting a lecture, happen to
glance down and fine huge reproductions of the sex
organs staring them in the face. We’re sure their impres-
sions of Washington and Lee would be altered consider-
ably.

Perhaps the reason the University has not rectified
the situation is that it would be a losing battle—as soon
as one desk was refinished, three more defaced ones might
appear. If this is the case, then it really is too bad—and
things are a lot sorrier than we thought.

The situation really should be a matter of student re-
sponsibility. The thought of administrative paternalism
slapping the hands of nasty little boys is unpleasant; stu-
dents should take enough pride in Washington and Lee
to see that the artisans under discussion are turned into
the Student Control Committee and duly dealt with.

What would the SCC do in such a case? We don’t
know; to our knowledge, no one has ever been turned in
for “classroom pornography.” But we think they should
be.

At any rate, some of the attention directed toward The
Southern Collegian might be put to better use in this
area—a problem which even high schools shouldn’t have
to confront, let alone universities full of honorable men.

Search for Communication
Basic Antonioni Theme

By TOM PACE

The Night—directed and written by Michelangelo Antonioni. With
Jeanne Moreau, Marcello Mastroianna, and Monica Vitti. At the
Lyric, tonight. ee
The Night is the second part of the Antonioni trilogy;

a trilogy concerned with modern man’s inability to love, to com-

municate, to feel. Antonioni has become one of the two or three most

important directors alive. He deals with this inner struggle—a strug-
gle which, admittedly, some have dealt with before—in a manner
which is original; and which is provoking and exciting.

Marcello Mastroianni plays a writer who has just published

a successful book. Jeanne Moreau plays his wife. The film begins

with them visiting a close friend in the hospital who is about to

die. Mastroianni tries to amuse him, to humor him, to keep his
spirits up. Moreau cannot stand staying there. She leaves, goes
outside, and cries. The foundation is laid. Mastroianni feels he
can no longer write. He is almost completely isolated. Once a young
man who would have killed himself if he could not have written, he
finds himself ready to compromise with what he despises; with the
society which is controlled by industrialists. He feels he has failed.

Moreau feels his failure. And she loses her convictions too. She is

unable to devote herself to her husband, and unable to love him.

Without this devotion, he is bored with her.

A Day and a Night
But Antonioni is not satisfied with letting them come to this
knowledge, and then leaving them. He has already done that in

L’Avventura. In The Night his characters are unwilling to accept

their situation. The film is concerned with one day and one night

in these people's lives. Antonioni uses this time to show them coming
to an awareness of their circumstances, followed by a refusal to
submit to them, followed by more realization, and finally by an at-
tempt to rekindle their old love.

With Antonioni as with other great directors of the cinema, it
is his method which makes him unusual. Antonioni is able to create
and maintain a mood that is perfect for his subject. His treatment
is slow, eareful, and melancholy. This mood is interrupted very
few times; when it is, it is to show those few moments in which
life is really life, not a living death as it has become. Certain scenes
illustrate this technique so excellently that they deserve detailed
discussion.

 

Seach for Communication
Early in the film Jeanne Moreau goes for a walk. She is tired
and bored, feeling very badly about the visit in the hospital. This
walk is an attempt to rediscover her sympathies, to revitalize
her feelings. During the walk she encounters two men, drunk and
laughing and talking with each other. She laughs with them—not

Last Week: The theory was ad-
vanced that Ernest Hemingway, in
committing suicide, was unable to
stand by his own code of “holding
tight” against bad odds—the very
code which Hemingway himself had
enforced in the characters of his
greatest heroes. A few more ex-
amples are included in this con-
cluding article.

Frederick Henry, hero of Farewell
to Arms, met Catherine Barclay at
a time when he was trying to keep
himself aloof from the world—he
wanted to remain on the perimeter
of life, to avoid becoming involved
emotionally in it. But he discovered
a receptive outlet for his love in
Catherine, and became absolutely
devoted to her—his life was centered
upon her survival: “Dear God, don’t
let her die. Please please, please
dear God, don’t let her die.”

The World Breaks Everyone

Running parallel to Henry’s de-
votion to Catherine is the novel’s
theory that the world breaks every-
one, “and afterward many are strong
at the broken places.” When Cath-
erine died, Frederick Henry was a
broken man, but we are left with
the idea that the broken pieces will
become strong again. Henry will
return to America and live his life
much as Jake Barnes lived his. He
will never love another woman
again, at least not as he loved Cath-

erine, and in this sense Henry is a
lot like Jake Barnes.

A far different character from
either Henry or Barnes is Robert
Jordan, hero of For Whom the Bell
Tolls, whom E. B. Burgum has
called “the only character of Hem-
ingway’s creation whom he treats
with unreserved affection and ad-
miration.” From one point of view,
Jordan is the most admirable of
Hemingway’s heroes: he is strong,
handsome, world-wise, dedicated,
courageous, intelligent, and capable
of fulfilling his orders.

Robert Jordan's Idealism

Jordan is an idealist, and he loses
his life trying to stand by that ideal.
In the face of impossible odds, and
with the knowledge that the failure
to retreat would mean certain death,
Jordan maintained his belief that if
the loss of his life in any way de-
tained the advance of the Fascists,
then it was worth the sacrifice. In a
sense, then, Jordan was the great-
est code hero of them all for he was
not merely living out his life under
unsatisfactory conditions, but was
giving it up for the code.

Nick Adams in the short story,
“Big Two-Hearted River,” went on
a fishing trip to help himself forget
what had happen to him during the
war. Most of the story is devoted to
detailed descriptions of how Nick
sets up his camp, the food which he

eee

eats, and how he collects grasshop-
pers early in the morning before the
dew evaporates.

Ritual of Nick Adams

The emotions which Nick feels are
intense—he eats slowly so he can
enjoy his food; he waits a bit for
the spaghetti and beans to cool so
he won’t burn his tongue. He, like
Jake, is very meticulous and care-
ful about everything he does so that
nothing will be ruined.

The reason for Nick’s careful ac-
tions is that they are part of a heal-
ing process for him—they bring a
sense of order to his life, an order
which has gone since he has ex-
perienced the brutality and stupidity
of war. Fishing was Nick’s healing
agent.

The Good Place

But Ernest Hemingway had gotten
too old to be able to participate in
these actions which were his healing
agents. For after all, Hemingway
was Frederick Henry, Jake Barnes,
Robert Jordan, and Nick Adams.
Jake Barnes, the insomniac, had slept
very well on the banks of the river
after he had caught six fish; this
was because he was in “the good
place.” Hemingway, as an old man,
could no longer go there.

It is possible that Hemingway, in
the middle of his last novel, took a
long look at himself and at the novel.

The Revolution of ’63

 

Segregation Weak Economically

Editor’s Note: This is the con-
cluding article in a series which
was originally published in the
Waynesboro News-Virginian.

By LOUIS W. HODGES

Desegregation is coming. The
forces which will make our racial
policies are already at work. The
events of last summer are but signs
of the presence of
such forces.
_ The obvious in-
fluences leading
_ toward a_ more
" sane society are
. likely not the im-
portant ones.
The  demonstra-
tions, the bomb-
ings, the resolu-
tions, the court
— ' decisions — these
os. ong things are but the
surface signs that a revolution is on.

Desegregation will come, but not
because men resolve to make a bet-
ter world. Discrimination against the
Negro will cease, but not out of
goodness and high principle. Nor will
discrimination stop because men
are influenced deeply by rational

  
   
   

argument or by such articles as
this series has been. Men will de-
segregate because it will increasing-
ly become economic necessity—be-
cause we cannot afford not to!

Economics Demand Integration

Industry and all sound economic
systems recognize the necessity to
provide the best products possible
with the least expenditure. This de-
mands that industry employ the
best executive, staff, and labor avail-
able, whatever their racial back-
ground. The recognition of this will
increasingly motivate the Negro to
seek education and training.

The Negro’s more insistent de-
mand will apply greater pressure to
educational institutions to deseg-
regate, to admit the student most
able to earn regardless of race. The
white will come to know the Negro
as never before, that is, as an equal,
and will gradually abandon the
mythical fear of the Negro as a
race—this fear being the real root
of prejudice. (Incidentally, we do
not hold prejudice against the in-
dividual Negro, only against the
“Negro Race.” Here we have our

bogey man—an abstraction, like all
bogey men have to be.)
Change Comes Slowly

The professional reformer of so-
ciety is not happy with this slow
process. He wants immediate change.
Yet if we are to be realists, we must
think in terms of generations rath-
er than years. The Negro children
beginning the first grade this fall
will finish high school in 1975. They
have higher hopes and reason for
stronger motivation than any other
class of Negro pupils in our history.
When they complete college in 1979
the lessons of the past will have
been learned more effectively. They
will have a solid place in our society.

The wheels of God’s time turn
slowly, but they grind exceedingly
fine. Our little social experiments
crumble, This will be the destiny
of segregation. The role of the sane
citizen for the present is to under-
stand the forces at work and to
channel them in constructive rather
than destructive directions.

One thing remains clear: desegre-
gation is coming. We are all more
aware now than we were before
“the Revolution of 63.”

Socialized Medicine: Is It Really a Success?
Are Foreign Countries Satisfied With It?

By WYATT B. DURRETTE

That the system of medical care
in the U.S. is imperfect seems be-
yond doubt. But
= contra to Syd
Lewis, writing in
Friday’s R-t P, I
submit that on
balance it is su-
perior to the sys-
tems, socialist “ or
. free, in other
parts of the world.

In an array of
statistical leged-
ermain Mr. Lewis
downgrades USS.
medical performances by citing dif-
ferent countries that surpass us in
one or two areas. His logical con-
clusion should be, if anything, that
our system is not superior in every
measure to the rest of the world’s
combined. This is hardly astound-
ing.

 

Durrette

Lesson In Unreasoning

But Mr. Lewis’s logic is a side-
show worthy of special note. Follow,
if you will, this lesson in “unreason-
ing”: (1) each player on UCLA’s
NCAA basketball champs may be
inferior to one or more athletes
elsewhere in the country; ergo (2)
UCLA is not the nation’s number
one team. It is with similar analyti-
cal clarity that Mr. Lewis views U.S.
medical achievements.

However, in the introduction to
his symposium, Financing Medical
Care: An Apprasial of Foreign Pro-
grams, Dr. Helmut Schoeck, pro-
fessor of sociology at Emory Uni-
versity, writes: “The history and
performance of compulsory health
plans in other countries, as well
as the absence of major health prob-
lems in countries without national
compulsory schemes, hardly sug-
gests that this antiquated approach
to medical care is the wave of the
future....[T]he nationalization of
medical care is on the way to be-
coming a _ discredited, antiquated
idealogy.”

Finland's Health

Particularly, Finland, cited twice
by Mr. Lewis as superior to the
U.S. in two categories, has not
adopted compulsory health plans in
any form. And Switzerland, cited
once, beyond a small government
subsidy to assist a few voluntary
plans, remains committed to a volun-
tary medical system.

Writing of West Germany, cited
once, Professor Hans Schulten, for-
mer dean of the Medical School of
Cologne University, points out that,
“all our hospitals are continuously
overcrowded . . . The health system
in Germany with compulsory mem-
bership for most employed persons
offers numerous opportunities for
abuse and fraud... and is just as

wasteful of drugs as it is of doctor’s
time.”
Sweden’s Medical Headache

Dr. Alfred Zanker, correspondent
for the Neue Zurcher Zeitung, ob-
serving Sweden’s (cited once) com-
pulsory program writes, “it has fal-
len far short of its promises and
has developed unforseen complica-
tions. The first five years of com-
pulsory health insurance have re-
sulted in dangerous fiscal strain.
For many people, tax evasion has
become a matter of economic sur-
vival.

“Sweden is one welfare state
where the mask of benevolence and
generosity has already worn thin in
a relatively few years. The public
in countries which have so far
avoided the pitfalls of compulsory
health insurance would be well-
advised to take a hard second look
at the usual claims that such state
medicine will cost only pennies a
day.

“The end of 1961 found Sweden’s
medical care situation quite alarm-
ing. Publie criticism is ever more
frequent and voeal. Much attention
was paid to reports from Lund, a
university city, where forty severe-
ly ill persons—all on the waiting
lists of the overcrowded hospitals—
died before they could be admitted.”

‘Only Way’

In January, a General in the Air

Presidency of the
United States. He,
and a group of
loud supporters,
have declared
themselves in fa-

from present policy is necessary for

He even claims to know what that
policy should be.

 

Senator Goldwater and his sup-
porters claim that to stand up to
a communist is to defeat him.
These people point with satisfac-
tion to instances where the United
States has stood resolutely on an
issue and the Soviet Union has
backed down. They then claim that
on every issue where we threaten
the Soviet Union they will back
down. Their idea of a foreign
policy is to back down the Rus-
sians with threats, and when they
won't back, then bomb them,

It is these same people who would
withdraw diplomatic recognition of
the Soviet Union. It is as if some-
how that would show that a Com-
munist system is morally repre-
hensible. The battle cry is that the
East listens to nothing but strength
and to even try to deal with them
is to suggest weakness,

Surely it is naive to think that the
second most powerful nation in the
world is going to be backed out of
existence by threats of war. The
Soviet Union, a communist nation,
exists and is strong, and as much
as we dislike it, we must deal with
them. True, the time may come when
we may have to drop bombs on
the Soviet Union, or some other
nation, in order to defend our own
way of life. But it is foolish to
think that the Soviet Union will not
use its bombs if it has to do so to
protect its way of life,

But since the Soviet Union has
gotten nuclear weapons, the na-
ture of war and its use as a threat
as a means of achieving diplomat-
ic ends has been severely limited.
Because of the unimaginable po-
tential of modern weapons, total
war is no longer a rational alter-
native if, indeed, it ever was, In
a total war, the entire world would
be the battleground, and the vic-
tors would be nonexistent. Lead-
ers of both the East and West
must realize this, and must plan
their policy accordingly.

To withdraw diplomatic recogni-
tion of your own worst enemy is
to say that there is no possible fur-
ther negotiation. And there are
those who would claim that this is
precisely the case. But we must deal
with the Soviet Union because we
have no choice. If either is to sur-
vive, then both must survive, for
to destroy one is to destroy the
other.

There is evidence that the leaders
of the Soviet Union realize this.
Their awareness of its importance to
them is shown in the ideological
split with Red China. To be sure,
they are not trying to argue that
the Soviet Union and the United
States should be allies. But they

Michaels, Bocetti Lead 1950 Gator Bowl Team

As Part Il of the Tuesday Sports series W&L’s For-
gotten Teams, we are this week featuring perhaps the
greatest General football team in the school’s history. This
is the team that produced such heroes as Walt Michaels
and Gil Bocetti, won the Southern Conference title and
went on to the post-season Gator Bowl. We have tried to
incorporate some of the spirit and glory of the bygone na-
tional recognition in this Part 1I—W&L’s Gator Bowl Foot
ball Team of 1950.

By JIM CROTHERS
Tuesday Sports Editor
Every once in a while it is gratifying to remember the good
old days of Washington and Lee sports, big-time football in
particular. Granted, the present non-subsidization policy allows
more boys to participate and less chance for sports to dominate
academic pursuits; however, the thoughts of capacity football
crowds, national recognition, and real “hard-nosed” play with
opponents such as West Virginia, Virginia and VPI do stimu-
late fond memories.
In the fall of 1950, head football mentor, George Bar-
clay, led his vaunted Generals to an 8-2 seasonal record with

 

Walt Michaels, the “Big Train” as he was dubbed, shows why he led
the 1950 football team in rushing (712 yards) and scoring (89 points).
Notice the capacity Wilson Field crowd that came to cheer home the
Southern Conference champions.

VMI Trounces WGL, 5-0
In First Practice Scrimmage

By SKIP CHASE
Assistant Sports Editor

Yesterday afternoon the baseball nine of Coach Joe Lyles
fell victim to their cross-town rivals in a scrimmage that saw
few hits with VMI picking up most of them for a 5-0 decision.

Trying to play “balanced ball,” the Generals looked good

on defense with the exception of*

 

 

two costly errors accounting for
three unearned runs in the top of
the third inning. At the plate, how-
ever, the W&L nine could collect
only one clean hit and for the most
part were behind the pitching as an
abundance of foul balls indicated.
In Preperation for Bucknell

The purpose of the scrimmage was
to better the team’s batting timing
in preparation for Thursday’s opener
at home with Bucknell.

Co-captain Brice Gamber started
for the General staff and held the
Keydets to only one earned run
in three complete innings. Fresh-
man righthander Pete Heumanns
and his amazing curve looked good
in relief while Chris Wigert, al-
ready picked as Thursday’s starter,
saw limited action in right field. It
is worthy to note also that neither
Gamber nor Heumanns issued a
single walk in five full innings.

victories over Furman, W. Va., Citadel, Davidson, VPI, Del
aware, Louisville, and Richmond. Led by co-captains Don
Fergusson and Joe McCutcheon, All-American Walt Michaels,
and All Southern Conference selection Gil Bocetti, this Wash-
ington and Lee team rushed 2,995 yards and scored 318 points
in ten games.

Losses to Virginia, 26-21, and Tennessee, 27-20, during
the season were disappointments, but Michael’s season point
output of 89 and Bocetti’s fine passing kept the Generals unde-
feated in the Southern Conference and ranked nationally as
number two in the South. Some mention must be made of the
prodigious feats of Walt Michaels while at W&L. The “Big
Train,” as the sports writers nick-named him piled up 712 yards
rushing from his fullback position, never got stopped for a loss,
and had a final rushing average of 6.0 yards-a-carry. From the
General team, Michaels went to the professional Cleveland
Browns where he starred and was selected to All-Pro teams
several times.

Washington and Lee easily swept past its first three 1950
opponents with wins over Furman (27-6) favored West Vir-
ginia (26-7) and defensively minded Citadel (20-0.) Virginia
was the next General opponent and some long-forgotten spirit
was revived for this thirty-second meeting of these rivals. The
entire front page of the Ring-tum Phi was about the upcoming
contest, all the available seats were taken a week before the
game, and Cy Young spoke to a wild impromptu pep-rally.
However the Generals saw a 21-13 half-time lead dissolve
with U.Va.’s aerial attack and fell victim, 26-21.

Everyone got into the scoring act at Davidson (47-12) as
the Minks prepared for Tennessee, where two long punt re-
turns and an injury to quarterback Bocetti led to a 27-20 loss
to the Vols. After this second loss, the Generals settled down
to trounce VPI in the mud, 25-7, and to humiliate the Uni-
versity of Delaware, 32-0. By this time rumors were beginning
to circulate about bowl possibilities for W&L, and the Rich-
mond Times-Dispatch indicated that Washington and Lee
was indeed a “fair bet” to get the bid.

An intercepted Louisville pass on their own one-yard line,
gave the Generals a close 33-28 win over the Cardinals. Lead-

‘One-Point’ Ruling Clarified

ing 20-0 at the half, W&L almost succumbed to the Louisville
passing game, but held on for the win in this wild, high-scoring
contest. With this victory and an almost assured Southern Con-
ference title (Richmond remained on the schedule), bowl ru-
mors were becoming more intense with everyone wondering
what the school policy would be concerning W&L’s first bowl
bid. Michaels ended the season by scoring 25 points in the 67-
7 expected rout of Richmond, but sustained an injury which
caused him to miss the Gator Bowl game.

As Southern Conference Champs with five of the eleven
members on the Virginia All-star team, the Generals quickly
accepted the Gator Bowl bid and began preparations for the
New Year’s classic. The Cowboys of Wyoming, Skyline Con-
ference Champs, however, proved too much for the Lexington
boys as the Generals fell to defeat, 20-7. The loss of Michaels
coupled with Wyoming’s aerial attack gave the Cowboys two
early touchdowns which W&L could never match. ‘Neverthe-
less, as the 1950 Calyx says, “the Bowl Bid was in itself a tri-
bute to our great and very deserving football team.”

 

In another action shot of the W&L Gator Bowl team, halfback Jim
Stark picks up good yardage and reveals why he copped All Southern
Conference honors in 1950.

The Message Of ‘The Night’: |
Man’s Incapacity To Feel

(Continued from page 2)

knowing what they are laughing
about, only trying to be a part, to
feel empathy with them. She fails.
She then returns to a place where
she and Mastroianni used to go when
they were younger. There she is
talked to as if she were a whore.
Mastroianni comes to pick her up.
She is standing by a tree which
has a special place in her memory.
He wonders why she is _ there.
She does not explain. During this
walk, the only sounds are natural
ones. There is little music whatso-
ever. The camera is kept, usually at
a distance. The effect is somnambul-
istic.

Later that night, they are at a
party thrown by a big industrialist.
The party is not a lively one, or at
least doesn’t seem so. Then to make
his point more graphic, Antonioni
livens the party up. It begins to rain
and the people are laughing and
shouting and throwing each other
into the swimming pool. It should
be exciting. But Antonioni keeps
his eamera viewing the party from
a distance; he keeps each individual
isolated in his revelry; he uses no
music. Thus, while watching some-
thing which appears to be wild and
exciting, one feels nothing more
than an extension of the slow, mel-
ancholy feeling which has gone be-
fore.

‘The Finest Scene’

In what is probably the finest
scene in the film, and one of the
truly great scenes in cinema, An-
tonioni watches Jean Moreau and
a man who has picked her up, driv-
ing in the rain. He keeps the
camera outside the car viewing them
through the windshield and window
constantly covered with water. As
the drive, very slowly, they are
sometimes illuminated by _ street
lights, sometimes nothing but shad-
owy outlines. The times when the
light shines represent the moments
when Moreau feels she is living. The
reason it goes dark is because this
is only one more futile attempt.
But the symbolism is not obtrusive
here, for it is only natural that their
figures do become alternately il-
luminated and darkened.

Antonioni’s Theme
Those are several scenes chosen

to illustrate his technique. His sub-|
ject needs elaboration. Antonioni
is dealing with modern man. He is
showing how man today finds it
nearly impossible to feel, to have
a real system of values, to com-
municate with others. His theme}
is not far from one of Yeat’s—that
the best lack all conviction, while
the worst are full of passionate in-
tensity. Mastroianni and Moreau
are bored, unfeeling, living dead. No
mattery how they try to escape it,
this fact seems constant. Antonioni
does not explain why. He presents
his characters and demands that his
audience participate with them. You
are asked to think and feel while

 

you watch them. If there is truth in|
what he says, you will discover it.
Many will not see it as truth, and|
many will find this film boring. I)
think that perhaps there is some con- |
nection between these reactions. I)
personally found truth in his char-|
acters, and his story. I found truth |
in his method of telling the story. |
And I think The Night is one of the!
best films ever made.

(Continued from page 2)

It was a story about war—something
he had already done. He said, “All
that many novelists write in their
later years is simply a recombination
again and again of the scenes and
characters and incidents of their
early work, and with less art and
less enthusiasm and energy.” Per-
haps Hemingway realized that this
indictment also applied to him.

A Short Life Is Better

Even more significantly, Heming-
way described his thoughts as an old
man, at the time he was writing
The Old Man and the Sea: “The
book which I wished to be the
crowning work of my life was The
Old Man and the Sea. The work was
done under great difficulties. Old
age was creeping upon me. But few
men die of old age. Almost all die
of disappointment, passionate, men-
tal or bodily work, or accident. Man
is the most hard worked of all ani-
mals. A long life deprives man of his
optimism. A short life is better.”

tenaciously claim that war is quite
impossible, that the West must be
destroyed by its own “internal cor-
ruption” and Communist goods pro-
duction—not by bombs.

Surely ,we of the West should be
willing to match capitalism with
communism. And if the Soviet is
willing to rule out the use of total
war to accomplish its ends, we
should be willing to do the same.

In short, both sides must real-
ize that total war is no longer a
rational alternative, that both
system are probably here to stay
for quite a while. Consequently,
they will have to get along to-
gether if either is to survive. This
cannot be done by mutual intimi-
dation, or threat of annihilation.

Rather, leaders of both sides will
have to be reasonable with each
other, and see that co-existence can
be accomplished in a way commens-
urate with national and ideological

 

goals. I think that this is possible. |
If men have reason, if men have}
the vision to look beyond their

Hemingway Wanted To Live His

Hemingway was the kind of man
who wanted to live life intensely,
and as he realized that the cancer
in his body would drain him more
and more of any intensity, perhaps
he decided to end his life quickly,
but happily, like Francis Macomber;
“a short life is better.”

A Time To Die

With his suicide, Hemingway add-

However, if you make a 0.5 at mid-

you may start another one. For
example, if Hairy Collegian played
football and basketball (both occur
in the same semester) and did not
have a 1.0 in semester, he could play
football, but would have to get a
0.5 at midsemester to play basketball
in the same semester.

Besides athletics (what else is
there?) other activities on this pro-

and forensic organizations, as well
as all student publications.

thrice) National Health Service R.
H. Davis writes in the British Med-
ical Journal: “Clearly 14 years of
socialism have made us completely
shameless, for no one can believe
these policies to be in the national
interest.”

The exodus of England’s doctors
to the U.S. is a national disgrace,
but the most embarrassing factor is
that during the first 14 years of the
N.H.S. England constructed only one
new hospital while the U.S. was

Medical Contributions of U.S.

Now to the target of Mr. Lewis’s
criticism. Aside from my bias for
freedom over compulsion, I prefer
our system for another reason: it de-
livers the goods. The U.S. has made
more important drug discoveries in
the last two decades than all the
rest of the world combined, 7 times
as many as the next leading country.
And 80 per cent of all these phar-
maceutical wonders were developed
by private industry.

According to the Dept. of Labor’s
Bureau of Statistics of 1960 physi-

.| cians fees had risen 95 per cent and!

all medical costs 115 per cent in the
last 20 years. Compared with 145
per cent for public transportation,
150 per cent for food, 174 per cent
for shoes, 233 per cent for men’s
haircuts, 313 per cent for domestic
servants, the increase is moderate.

who sign payroll certifications for

U.S. Unsurpassed

Surely the U.S. cannot claim leader-
ship in every field of medical en-
deavor; no one disputes this. But I
submit that our medical standards
have no peer, and if I am worng,
I should like to learn of the one
country which surpasses.

Speaking of Austria’s system (not
cited) as long ago as March 8, 1958,
Dr. Karl Kummer, a Labor politician
himself, obeserved, “all who have
had dealings with our compulsory

health insurance complain about
their shortcomings. These institu-
tions have become  collectivistic

bureacracies, frightening to the in-
dividual.”

As Santayana noied, “those who
do not learn from history are
doomed to repeat it.” Let us, then,
work diligently to correct the im-
perfections of our system rather than
discard it for a pitiful experiment in
one that has proven in all its myrid
guises to be costly, inefficient, and,
most importantly, inferior. All at
the price of human freedom.

NOTICE

On January 11, 1964, at about noon,
two students were hitch-hiking to
Washington, D.C., and were picked
up by an older man who had been
involved in an accident. Because
of his condition, he asked the stu-
dents to drive for him as far as
Fairfax. There is some question
about the insurance due to this ac-
cident, and it would help the family
very much if these students would
get in touch with Mrs. McClung in
the Registrar’s Office. It is under-
stood that the students will be
placed under no obligation.

Al Eckes, University Party Chairman and, Tom Pace, Progressive Party
Chairman, prepare for April 16 elections.

EC Schedules April 16
Date For ’64 Elections

Student body elections will be
held on April 16 this year, the
Thursday before Spring Dances, ac-
cording to Student Body President
Bill Noell. The four student body
officers are President of the Student
Body, Vice-President, Secretary, and
Faney Dress President. These officers
will be elected by all four classes and
the law school.

Amendment Proposed

There is a complication in the
election of class officers. According
to the Student Body Constitution,
class elections must be held on
May 4. This year, however, the
Mock Convention is scheduled for
that date, and it is felt that Con-
vention activities would make it dif-
ficult for people to go to the Stu-
dent Union to vote.

The election date can be changed
only by an amendment to the Con-
stitution, and the Executive Com-
mittee plans to submit such an

Dorm Counselors

To BeA pointed

Applications are invited for the
position of Freshman Dormitory
Counselor for the 1964-65 academic
year.

Certain giudelines for the selec-
tion of Dormitory Counselors have
been set up on the basis of past ex-
perience. Applicants must be at least
current sophomores, and should not
have routine commitments after 8:00
p.m, that would normally take a
Counselor away from the dormitory
for any appreciable time.

While Counselorships are not
awarded on an academic basis, a stu-
dent who has failed to maintain a
C average would probably not be
selected.

The awards of Counselorship are
not based on financial need. How-
ever, in order to ensure the greatest
possible contact with freshmen,
Counselors are provided with a
single room in the dormitory and the
dinner meal in the Commons, which
they are expected to eat with the
freshmen.

The primary basis for selection
of Counselors will be that of gen-
eral fitness to aid in making the
Freshman Dormitory an adequate
environment for a student's fresh-
man year,

Students who are presently Dor-
mitory Counselors and who wish to
return next year should submit
letters to this effect to the Dean of
Students’ Office before Saturday,
April 18.

New applications should be filed
in person in the Office of the Dean
of Students by the same date,
April 18, and should include infor-
mation that will be helpful to the
selection Committee, Further de-
tails concerning duties and re-
sponsibilities, can be obtainted
from John Madison, Head Dormi-
tory Counselor, and Buck Ogilvie,
Jim Maffit, or Bob Henley, As-
sistant Head Dormitory Counsel-
ors, all members of the Selection
Committee.

 

amendment to the student body at
the time of the Ajpril 16 elections.
The proposed amendment would
provide for rescheduling of the class
elections in the event of some ser-
ious conflict.

In the class elections, the student
body will choose its Executive
Committee representatives and _ its
class officers. There are three law
school representatives, two senior
representatives, two from the junior
class, and one each from the sopho-
more and freshman classes. The
freshman representative will be
elected next fall by the class of
1968.

Class Officers

Each class has a president, vice-
president, secretary, and _ historian.
The senior class
presidents—for
arts, and science.

Nominations for the student body
and class offices are generally made
by the two parties, but write-in
candidates are legal. This year’s
nominees should be named _ shortly
by the University and Progressive
party cliques.

The Election will be held in the
student union from 8:25 am. to
5:00 p.m. on the scheduled election
dates. Voting will be held by sec-
ret ballot, and the Executive Com-
mittee is responsible for counting
votes.

Law Lectures

Set For April

John Ritchie, Dean of the North-
western University School of Law,
will be the principal speaker at the
16th annual Tucker Lectures here
next month.

The lectures will be given April 10
at 8 p.m. and April 11 at noon, in
Lee Chapel. Dean Ritchie will de-
liver both addresses.

He will speak on “Legal Educa-
tion in the United States.” Dean
Ritchie is current president of the
Association of American Law
Schools. His first address is entitled
“Yesterday”; his second, “Today
and Tomorrow.”

The dean holds law degrees from
the University of Virginia and Yale
University law schools.

Before accepting the deanship at
Northwestern, he served
ant dean at the University of Vir-
gilia law school, dean at Washington
University (St. Louis) and dean at

as assist-

the University of Wisconsin law
school.
“All members of the Washington

and Lee faculty and student body
are invited to attend both lectures,”
Dean Charles P. Light of the W&L
School of Law, said today.

“This is an excellent opportunity
for anyone considering a career in
legal education to hear about the
field,’ Dean Light said.

The weekend of the lectures will
actually serve a dual purpose for
the law school. The annual meeting
of the Washington and Lee Law
School Association will also be held
at that time.

Strict Quarantine Placed

On Students

And Faculty

Spring vacation has been canceled.

An official statement of the University has announced
that due to the “‘critical’’ state of the current German measles
epidemic, the entire faculty and student body will undergo

strict quarantine.

The quarintine will be imposed for a
*

statement read, thus “necessitating
cancellation of the spring vaca-
tion as scheduled.”

The statement was issued this af-
ternoon following an emergency
meeting of the administration and
and faculty. The meeting had been
prompted by a warning of the Uni-
versity medical office that the epi-
demic had reached such acute pro-
portions that a quarantine was
deemed advisable.

Classes will not be held next week,
but will reswme Monday, April 6.
Students are advised to stay in
close quarters. The medical office
has reported the infirmary to be
filled to capacity.

The epidemic first began late last
week when a number of students
simultaneously reported to the in-
firmary with severe sore throats.

“The sudden changes in climate,
added to the seasonal work of mid-
semester tests and papers, helped
account for the epidemic,” the in-
firmary reported.

For the student body, most of
whom had been planning to go
South during the week’s holiday, the
announcement is having an elec-
terifying effect. The ABC store and
several taverns have been forced to
close down due to the mobbing
students. The Lexington police force
has been placed on a full alert. A
ten o’clock curfew has been set by
the town mayor.

 

Giltlaw's Health
Reported Better

Dean Frank Gilliam, stricken with
a heart attack in Cincinnati, con-
tinues to improve, according to
members of the administration who
are in contact with him.

All indications from Holmes Hos-
pital, where Dean Gilliam is recup-
erating, are that his condition is
relatively good, and that he will
eventually make as full a recovery
as possible. The past Dean of Admis-
sions and Dean of Students has
already dictated several letters to
Lexington. Dean Gilliam’s son, who
was called to Cincinnati immediately
after the heart attack, has returned
home.

The attack came on March 13 as
Dean Gilliam and his wife toured
the midwest visiting alumni, pros-
pective students, and friends.

 

ten-day period, the

 

Student reaction is varied.

“As long as the Paramount and
the Liquid stay open,” one student
commented, “we'll survive.”

Another was less assured. “We'll
go batty,” he remarked. “Why
couldn’t they have extended the
quarantine to Sem?!”

The mayor, who is familiar with
W&L students from past incidents,
issued a plea for sanity, moderation,
and the continuation of good will be-
tween students and townspeople.

“Tell the students,’ he said, “to
remain calm in the face of this ad-
versity.”

When asked their opinion, the
Friday staff of the Ring-tum Phi
had this to say: “It will be curious
to see how many students will read
this article and won’t realize that it’s
all just a silly joke on our part
For those who don’t, we’re sorry.
There are inevitably one or two in
the crowd who can never spot an
April Fool’s stunt when they see
one. Ha!”

Cahoon Selected
For PBK Award

Edward Ray Cahoon, Jr., of
Chesapeake, Virginia, has been
awarded the Phi Beta Kappa
Sophomore Award for 1964.

Cahoon, a PiKA sophomore, is a
member of the Student Service So-
ciety and is on a Baker Scholar-
ship.

The Award, given annually by
Gamma of Virginia Chapter, goes to
the sophomore with the highest
scholastic average for the first three
semesters of his college career. The
purpose of the award is to encour-
age scholastic endeavor among un-
dergraduates during their first years
at Washington and Lee.

Cahoon is-a graduate of Oscar
Frommel Smith High School, in
South Norfolk, where he was vale-
dictorian of his class. At the end of
his first semester at Washington
and Lee he became a member of
Phi Eta Sigma, freshman academic
honorary society.

The award, established in 1955,
consists of a cash prize of $25 to be
used by the recipient for the pur-
chase of books for his personal li-
brary. Appropriate book plates are
inscribed indicating the significance
of the award.

Republican Party Officials
To Attend Mock Convention

Some of the Republican Party’s
outstanding young leaders will be
special guests at Washington and
Lee University’s 1964 Mock Con-
vention May 4 and 5.

Mock Convention Chairman Philip
D. Sharp, Jr., has announced that
D. E. “Buz” Lukens, chairman of
the Young Republican Party of Vir-
ginia; and John Edward Grenier,
chairman of the Republican Party
in Alabama have accepted invita-
tions to attend.

Other GOP leaders who have
said they will be present include
Mrs. Hazel Barger of Roanoke,
national committeewoman from
Virginia; Richard Obenshain of
of Richmond, chairman of the
Young Republican Federation of
Virginia; Marshall Coleman, a
University of Virginia undergrad-
uate who is chairman of Young
Southerners for Rockefeller; and
Art Groesbeck, acting executive
secretary of the Young Repub-
lican National Federation.

Each will be introduced to the
Mock Convention which will be at-
tempting to nominate the same can-
didate the national party will choose
this summer in San Francisco.

One of Virginia’s Republican cong-
ressmen, Sixth District Rep. Rich-
ard H. Poff, will introduce the
Mock Convention’s keynoter, for-
mer Minnesota Rep. Walter Judd,
who gave the keynote address to
the 1960 Republican National Con-

 

vention.

Lukens has a long list of Repub-
lican “firsts” to his credit. He cre-
ated and organized the first Young
Republican precinct canvassing in
the District of Columbia; is the
founder of the PACE seminars, first
Young Republican professional po-
litical school; and is the originator
of the District of Columbia Young
Republican breakfast featuring sen-
ators, congressmen, community and
political leaders. He has established
the first central office of the Wash-
ington Young Republieans, and as
membership chairman originated a
drive which tripled the city’s Young

Republican membership within 12
months.
As Republican candidate for

Congress from the first district of
Virginia in 1956, Henderson re-
ceived the largest vote of any
non-incumbent candidate in the
South. Under his chairmanship,
the Republican Party of Virginia
gained seats in five city councils
in the 1962 elections.

Henderson atttended the College
of William and Mary, served in the
Army during World War II and
was national president of the U.S.
Junior Chamber of commerce in
1952-53. As a recipient of a Special
Citizenship Award and grant from
the American Heritage Foundation
in 1954, he visited 50 countries or-
ganizing young men’s civic groups
and in Mexico City was named the
“Outstanding Jaycee of the World”

Easter For The Collegian

Education wears different clothes at every school. The
problems and solutions, the worries and joys of life at W&L
don’t seem to be shared by George-at-UNC, Jim-at LSU, or
Dave-at-Denison. We have all been aged in different vats,
and there seems to be nothing to talk about.

Easter is highlighted by the seemingly sad realization that
you no longer have much in common with the old “group.”
The golden “leaders” aren’t leaders any more; the hometown
athletic teams look pitifully small; Sally-next-door has a baby,
and her husband works the night shift in a mill somewhere.

We from W&L will brag about our wrestling or football
team, forget that we have a basketball team, relate various
embarrassing and eventful moments of Fancy Dress and pa-
jama parties, say nasty things about the administration—just
because it is the administration, and generally gripe about
returning to a beautiful, but overly academic, Lexington spring-
time, made bitter by the omnious fact of May exams.

Easter for the college student is also a time of trying in
vain to be really a part of the family again. Or, maybe, it is a
time when we realize that our relationship to our family is not
quite the same as it was before and we ventured off to college.
Thomas Wolfes “you can’t go home again’’ seems sadly ap-
propriate. The love is still there, the grass still needs cutting,
and there is still a crack in the front steps, but the guest towels
in the bathroom are a silent reminder that W&L is “home.”

Perhaps it will mean seemingly unlimited time with the
hometown girl—time to spend too much time with her, un-
consciously trying to make up for three months of road trips
or flick teams.

Easter 1964, no matter how gay and joyous, will still be
clothed in a lingering shame and grief because of the world’s
horror of November ’63. Both human decency and American
democracy were dealt harsh blows on that day. Easter 1964 will
find us thankful that our nation is recovering from this wound.

And, yet, despite our worries about the future and the
general pain of maturing, each of us knows the happiness that
is Easter and spring vacation, and each will leave W&L to-
morrow expecting to experience again this happiness. For
some, Easter 1964 will find its meaning in the events of 2000
years ago. For others, Easter 1964 will find expression in the
sharing of our experience and ourselves. For everyone, Easter
and spring vacation will be a time of joyful relief from the
routine walk up to the hill.

And the Ring-tum Phi takes this opportunity to wish for
you a very happy vacation—in whatever way you choose to
make it.

God Is Dead -- Part Il

 

Church 1964 - Lost Cause?

This week, we continue our role
as the Devil's Advocate against
the Church. “God is dead—Part
One” showed how little founda-
tion there was for placing the
Gospels as any sort of ultimate
authority for truth. Part Two
looks at the Church today and
its new status as a lost cause.

By KEN LANE
Editor-in-Chief

On this Easter weekend, ironically
enough, millions of Americans will
be commemorating the genesis of a
religious faith which, despite a long
and dynamic heritage, has come to
outlive itself and manifest itself
as a withering branch. The churches
this Sunday will be overflowing with
many once-a-year visitors who by
habit alone will pay their respects
to an institution healthy and thriv-
ing on the outside, but mortally dis-
eased and decaying within.

Decline in Europe

 

The decadence of the Christian
Church was most convincingly |
brought to our attention two sum-
mers ago on a tour through Europe. |
In each country we visited, on our |
enquiring about the strength of
the church, the inhabitants respond- |
ed with talk of decline and dimin-|
ishing loyalty. The students especi-
ally were negative on the subject.
“The church in our country is for
old people only. For us, there is no
challenge in it.” What they said was
no exaggeration. On Sundays, the
churches were scarcely half-full and
those attending were mostly middle-
aged or over.

Similarly in the United States,

The appeal of the church is dying.

Vocationally, the church offers no

  

 

challenge comparable to that of
IBM and Wall Street. For exam-

ple, in the fall of 1960, American
Protestants were told that in one

 

year alone the enrollments at
theological seminaries had de- |
creased 5 per cent; since the |

enrollment in the previous year
had been only 20,000, this percent-
age is alarmingly significant.

In 1962, the Christian Century |
magazine sent out questionnaires to|
presidents of the nation’s twenty-|
four leading seminaries. The survey |
showed that the decline in enroll |
ments were in may cases tapering |
off, but still there was a “universal |

 

uneasiness” exhibited by the re-
sponding presidents. The Century
remarked that the presidents of the
seminaries had requested the mag-
azine not to print anything that
“might occasion the slightest slack-
ening of effort or the least bit of
complacency on the part of the
church.” (Nov. 7, 1962.)

Now more than ever, the Church
depends on a large corps of well-
qualified workers if it is to survive.
Yet our young people are not re-
sponding. The church is no longer

Superb Acting Consumed;

gave the shaft another twist, in-

Rising Costs
Pose Problem
To US Medicine

By SYD LEWIS
Associate Editor

Medical advancement in this cen-
tury has been astonishing. Life ex-
pectancy since 1900 has increased by
some fifteen years; medical tech-
nology has been revolutionized; the
discovery of additional drugs has
been proceeding at a record pace.
However, this is not enough. There
still exists deficiencies which must
be corrected (such as those named in
last week’s article: infant death rates,
the morality from controlable dis-
eases, shortages of doctors, rising
costs, and price discrimination to
name a few). Mr. Durrette’s argu-
ment implied that medicine in the
U.S. is the best in the world (which
it might be) and therefore our sys-
tem should not be changed. Using
his own type of reasoning, this is
analogous to stating that the Boston
Celtics perennial champions in the
N.A.B., should not try to improve,
for they are the best already!

Rising Medical Costs

Before proceeding further, I must
correct the impression that medi-
cine in the U.S. has not had a rising
cost above other commodities which
Mr. Durrette tried to put across in
his article. It is true that there are
certain categories of goods whose
prices have risen faster than that
of medicine; however, this is the ex-
ception. Using the consumer index
of 1957-1959 with 100 as a basis, all
goods and services (listed on this
chart) have risen to 106.6 while the
cost of medicine has risen to 120.0.
Since 1947, medical services have
risen 164 per cent.

Mr. Durrette has said that there
are no if’s, and’s or but’s—socialized
medicine is taboo. This seems to be
an example of the basic deficiency
in conservative reasoning. Every-
thing to this political group appears
to be black or white. There is one
answer to everything. Yet this is
not the situation. There do exist
alternatives, and as long as this is
the case, we must experiment.

The Porritt Committee

Medicine is no exception to this
approach. Although Mr. Durrette has
given several qualified opinions on
the subject of socialized medicine,
he has not exhausted all views. The
Porritt Committee, whose director
was President of the Royal College
of Surgeons and which was organ-
ized under the auspices of the
British Organization of Medicine, not
the government, released this state-
ment: “Basically, the concept of a
comprehensive national health ser-
vice (in Great Britain) is sound.”
The statement is qualified by the
word basically; however, one must
remember that the present medical
system in Great Britain has existed
only since 1948 and there is no
reason to doubt that the faults will
not be corrected in time.

Anne Ramsay Somer, professor
at Haverford, after returning from
Europe and making first hand obser-
vations said: “...Most doctors in
these countries (Germany, Austria,
and Italy), especially Austria, have
long been enthusiastic supporters of
compulsory health insurance. ..”

giene, University of Toronto—pro-
claimed: “Provincial Hospital In-
surance and Diagnostic Service

Goldwater Position On ‘Peaceful Co-existence’ Clarified

It is true that Goldwater offers
a foreign policy that he believes
would be successful, but he certainly
doesn’t intend to give us a panecea
for all our problems with the Soviet

By HARRY BROOKBY
If senator Goldwater had read Mr.
Lamb’s article, “Negotiations with
the U.S.S.R. ‘Only Way’,” in Tues-
day’s edition of the Ring-tum Phi,

certainly he would voice a_ reply
in defence. Mr. Lamb has every
right to present his political views
toward Russia, but we should also
be allowed to hear more fully the
views of the senator.

Mr. Goldwater disagrees with sev-
eral of Lamb’s points, as may be
seen in the views expressed in the
senator’s book, Why Not Victory? In
the first place, Lamb stated that
“He (Goldwater) even claims to
know what that policy should be.”
Lamb is speaking of the senator’s
“autere and absolute foreign policy.”
Goldwater, however, states in his
book,

“I don’t know all the answers,
and I have very little patience
with those who pretend they do.
None of us here in Washington
knows all or even half of the an-
swers. You people out there in

stand that.”

 

Union. Just as Lamb gives us an
answer to the communist problem,
i.e., co-existence, Goldwater gives
us another alternative: to attain
victory. Goldwater says, “Victory
is the key to the whole problem;
the only alternative is, obviously,
defeat.” Why does Goldwater not
even consider co-existence, or in
other words, a “tie’? In his book,
he states,

“It is because the U.S. and the
U.S.S.R. stand for two antitheti-
cal concepts of the nature of man.
Our commitment is to things of
eternal value—we believe in truth
and honor and justice and the lib-
erty and dignity of man. The Rus-
sian doctrine is dedicated, in the
words of Stalin, ‘to the destruc-
tion of all capitalist society....
The individual is of no importance
except as he serves the state...
The end is justifiable by any
means,”

 

In the light of these facts, Gold-
water cannot see how we can ration-
ally say the answer is to “co-exist”
with those who have boldly stated
and dedicated themselves to our
destruction.

Co-existence

Lamb said that the answer to the
communist problem is to “co-exist”
with the Soviets because the only
other alternative is war, and “total
war is no longer a rational alter-
native.” Goldwater would agree to
the foolishness of war from the com-
munist point of view because they
are accomplishing their prime objec-

tive without having to bomb us.
The senator states,
“The Communist do not view

war as a ‘hot’ or ‘cold’ affair. To
them conflict is a continuing action
everywhere. At the moment, this
Russian strategy does not con-
template armed _ conflict, but
Khrushchev has never abandoned
the possibility of fighting to gain
his total end.”
Lamb stated

that the leaders of

 

“East and West” scorn war because

of the “unimaginable potential of
modern weapons.” Thus, Goldwater
and Lamb differ on the reason that
Khrushchev does not want war.
Does the concept “rational alterna-
tive” mean the same thing to John-
son that it does to Khurshchev? At
any rate, Goldwater and Lamb seem
to agree that war is unacceptable
to both East and West at the pres-
ent time.

More Faith

Lamb makes a further assump-
tion that both sides, seeing that war
is futile, will never risk starting a
war. He seems to have more faith
in the rational nature of the Com-
munist than Mr. Goldwater does.
Nevertheless, Goldwater and Lamb
agree that one of four alternatives,
i.e, war, should not be our major
objective in dealing with the Soviet
Union. Defeat, or a policy of letting
the Communists destroy our free-

doms is obviously another unac-
ceptable alternative to both Gold-
water and Lamb. We have seen
both persons’ views towards the
third alterna‘ive—co-existence. This
leaves the final alternative pre-

 

sented: victory. Goldwater asks,

“Can victory be achieved with-
out a nuclear war? My vociferous
critics would like us to believe that
there can be no communist war
victory without the destruction of
civilization. This is precisely
what the communists would like
us to believe. Their whole line of
attack through propaganda and
adroit economic, political, and mil-
itary moves, is directed toward
making us think in terms of fear.
They want to make sure that we
believe the risk is too great to
employ our strength. Their pur-
pose is intimidation and it is work-
ing too well.

“The choice is not yield or fight
a nuclear war. It is: win, or fight
a nuclear war. For a nuclear war
we shall certainly have to fight,
from whatever beleagured outpost
we are reduced to oecupying, if
we continue to yield, piece by
piece, all over the world. Finally,
in desperation, we would see the
horrible alternatives clearly in
view—a violent act of nuclear ag-
gresison or surrender, Our only

 

hope is to proclaim victory as our
aim and then to press boldly and
unremittingly on all fronts— al-
ways prepared to fight and making
sure the Communists always know
we are prepared to fight, as they
knew in the incidents at Quemoy,
Matsu, Lebanon, and in the Ber-
lin airlift,”

Alternatives

Thus, we have seen the positive
and negative alternatives of Sena-
tor Goldwater and Mr. Lamb. The
difference of their alternatives to
the communist menace seems to lie
in their different understandings of
the principles of Communism. Lamb
has faith in the possibility of the
compatibility of Communism and
in the future, while Goldwater looks
at the history of the last forty years,
and he sees that, “Communism is
an international conspiracy which
has restored slavery to the world
in vast geographic proportions.” He
sees no future utopia in a world
marked by past and present strife,
and he recognizes that we are en-
gaged in a war—“not a cold one, but
the Communist War
win it.”

W&L Ties Bucknell,
Loses to Williams

Two seasons opened here yester-
day afternoon.

W&L’s baseball team played to a
darkness-shortened 11-11 ten inning
tie with Bucknell. The Bisons had
lost three games in the previous
three days.

Meanwhile, as expected, the la-
crosse team lost to Williams, but
unexpectedly, by only four goals.

Williams won 9-5

Four-Base Error

The baseball game, played in a
Smith Field wind storm, was a
comedy of errors climaxed when

W&L centerfielder Gene Gillespie
dropped Joe Elliot’s fly ball in the
tenth inning. Elliot scored on the
four-base error.

Skip Chase went on to single,
steal and score in the bottom of the
inning, to tie. The Generals’ stolen
bases enabled them to stay in the
game. They stole nine.

Bucknell ..213 013 000 1—11 13 I1
MG sua 503 000 110 1—11 9 5
Hegmann, Lombardi (3), Elliot
(8) and Gallagher. Wigert and
Crenshaw.

The Generals committed five er-
rors, the Bisons 11. Bucknell short-
stop John Minsker took individual
honors with five. Only one W&L
run was earned.

Bucknell scored first, two runs on
four walks and no hits off pitcher
Chris Wigert in the first inning.
Wigert went the distance, walking
nine and striking out 11.

W&L moved into the lead on
Tom Crenshaw’s three-run homer,
but the Bisons singled their way
back to a 10-8 sixth inning lead.
The Generals tied it on unearned
runs resulting from two of Minsker’s
errors.

W&L opens its spring trip to-
morrow at Pfeiffer College. Coach
Joe Lyles will take 21 men but only
six pitchers. He said yesterday right-
hander Mason McGowin will be lost
for the season with a sore arm.

After the Pfeiffer game, the Gen-
erals meet Fort Bragg in a three-
game series. Lyles said he will have

 

to use freshman pitchers in that
series, which could turn out to be
a massacre.

Thursday, Friday and Saturday
W&L plays at Frederick, Old Do-
minion and Fort Lee. The team re-
turns home April 7, when it will
meet Castelton State.

Size, Speed Win

The lacrosse game, marked by ex-
ceptionally aggressive play, saw the
precision stickwork, size, and super-
ior speed of the Williams ten pre-
vail easily over the better condition-
ing of the W&L stickmen.

Williams was solidly superior in
every department, especially on at-
tack where vaunted attackman Tim-
my Baker had five assists.

The Generals’ attack game seemed
solid on those occasions when the
midfield succeeded in clearing the

 

Better Sports News

 

ball to them ,and even the big,
alert Williams defensemen could not
entirely stop Carroll Klingelhofer
(three goals) and John McDaniel
(two goals and two assists). Wil-
liams’ Annison was high scorer with
four goals.
Passing Improves

W&L’s passing game appeared
much improved since the Tuesday
scrimmage with Swarthmore, which
the Generals dropped 5-3, but their
inside feeding and coverage of
ground balls was still weak.

The Generals face Hofstra tomor-
row. Hofstra, lacking the size and
raw talent of Williams, has at least
an equivalent amount of experience
and will probably have even better
speed.

Trackmen Face
Old Dominion

Washington and Lee University’s
track team faces its toughest chal-
lenge of the season when it meets
Old Dominion College here this af-
ternoon.

The Generals, who lost to Old
Dominion 69-53 last year, will have
their work cut out for them again
this year.

Old Dominion boasts strength in
the dashes, hurdles, and jumps
where the Generals are weakest. In
addition the Monarchs can match
W&L in both depth and quality in
the Generals’ best events—the mile
and two-mile.

Distance men Lee Johnson, Charlie
Head, Riff O’Connor, and Andy Kil-
patrick, weight man Gaylord Gas-
que, and jumper Robin Kell form
the brunt of the W&L attack.

Chris Kell, recovering from a
pulled muscle which sidelined him
in 1963, gives W&L a _ top-notch
sprinter, but the Generals lack
depth here and in the 440. In the
880, sophomore Jim Thompson and
freshman Bill Wildrick form a good
one-two punch.

“If we could only get everybody
together at once, we would be con-
siderably stronger,” said coach
Norm Lord.

Tennis Trip To Open;
Eight Men To Meet W-F

Coach Bill Washburn’s _ tennis
team will begin a series of nine
spring vacation matches tomorrow
at Wake Forest.

Eight men will make the trip, the
first of its kind for W&L tennis
teams.

“Things look encouraging. We’ve
had more time to practice this year
than in the last few years, so the
team is farther along,” said Wash-
burn.

“It is difficult to say what our
chances are on this first spring trip.
Fort Eustis will be very strong and
so will the (Qld Providence) Rac-
ket Club.”

Old Dominion is the only vacation
opponent the Generals met last year.
W&L won then, 6-3.

Jim DeYoung, Randy Jones, Jim
Mell, Lindsey Short and Forrest
Dickinson will play the five top
spots. Howard Busse and Fred
Webb will alternate at the number
six spot.

Freshman Phil Thompson will go
along as a member of the number
two doubles team.

 

  
  

 
  

aN there
by Tim OKe efe

If you’ve ever thought of going into
baseball umpiring, Danny McDevitt,
former pitcher with the Los Angeles
Dodgers and the New York Yankees,
has these tips to pass on.

“You’ve got to have a real ap-
pearance of strength. You've got
to make your voice sound like it has
authority. And you've got to work
on developing your muscles in the
larynx,” he says.

McDevitt says that one of the
best training aids is a mirror. Then
you can practice snarling at your-
self and you “get to see for your-
self how things look.”

He had to give up pitching last
year when he had adhesions and
tendonitis.

“For adhesions you’re supposed to
throw and for tendonitis you’re sup-
posed to rest. There didn’t seem
any way out of it.”

New York has often been called
a city of great contrasts. Now it has
one more.

The New York Mets, the worst
baseball team in the National
League, this year will have the
NL’s best park. Some have called
this the finest baseball stadium
ever built.

All seats are faced toward sec-
on base or the 50-yard line (The
Jets of the AFL play there in the
winter) and there isn’t a post in
the place.

There also aren’t any bleachers—
only 55,000 bolted seats, painted dif-
ferent shades of green, blue, organge
and yellow.

And for the fans who can’t stand
to watch the Mets—10th last year,
favored to repeat—there are 21 es-
calators that will rapidly take them
out,

Across the street the World’s Fair
will be playing for the next two
years.

ized medicine) is well accepted by

hospital associations, the medical

profession, and the public. ..”
Need for Adaptation

The above are just a few of the
many qualified opinions supporting
socialized medicine. But these do not
validate the claim that we should
institute socialized medicine. Amer-
ica has circumstances different from
other countries. If socialized medi-
cine is to be tried in the US., it
must be under a special adaptation
for the United States. For if one
says what is good and bad for other
countries will be the same for the
United States, then it is necessary
to condemn capitalism as we know
it, for this system has failed in every
European country.

I believe the main corrections
which should be made in medicine
revolve around rising costs. There
should be a change in the institu-
tional administration of medicine,
such as more group practices, finan-
cial means of payment reforms, both
private and public, and at the same
time maintain as our basis a policy
which would be acceptable to the
American people.

Moreover, there must be more
federal and state aid to education
to induce more students to apply to
medical school. It is alarming to

competing with other, more chal-
lenging concerns. Here, then, is an
organization dying at its very life
center. In the remaining install-
ments of this series, we shall look
beyond these exterior symptoms in
an effort to determine some of the
significant causes of the church’s
decline.

NOTE: The purpose of | this
series is partly to test the de-
gree to which readers are con-
cerned about the issue of Christi-
anity and the Church. If, as the
catalogue states, we are “dedi-
cated to the Christian ideal,” then
the iconoclastic approach we have
assumed should hit right to the
core of the University’s sentsitivi-
ties.

The only way we can tell wheth-
er students are concerned or not
is through the feedback of our
readership. So far, we have re-
ceived only favorable reaction.
Does this indicate that the tenti-
ment of the student body is like-
wise cynical?

Optimistically believing this is
a subject toward which the Uni-
versity is not apathetic, we invite
letters of comment from both stu-
dents and faculty.

BY 0. E. SCHOEFFLER, esauine’s Fashion Director Ser

With Easter vacation already flashing the “Walk” sign, why not
decide before you go home on your number one suit and the rest of
your wardrobe. Aside from the traditional dress-up holiday, there
may be decisive interviews for either a summer job or a permanent
one if you’re a graduating senior—-and the clothes you wear—plus
the way that you wear them—make the pivotal first impression.
You want it to be right at first sight, so, let’s take a run-down on
what you might well select this Spring in fashion. pes

YOUR NUMBER ONE SUIT for warmer

weather is next to weightless in the new lighter-
than-ever flannels and polyester/wool blends.
Color-wise, consider the more definite blues, the
new lighter greys; see the classic Glen Urquhart
or ‘glen’ plaids.

THE GIFT OF ‘GAB’ you get with the return of

natural tan gabardine. Its fine diagonal twill
weave and surface sheen make it an excellent
choice for your Number One Suit. Today’s gab-
ardines also come in lighter weight wools and
new polyester/wool blends.

 

 

   

PRIDE OF THE OUTFIT: REGIMENTAL

STRIPES ... the resurgence noted by ESQUIRE
last fall is gaining momentum for Regimental
Stripes—the traditional colors of the historic
“m, British regiments. With scores of these famed
“atte! regiments—like the Grenadier Guards, the
, Royal Fusiliers, the Inskilling Dragoons—
there’s quite a roll-call of striking color com-
binations in pure silk repps for your selection.

DRESS SHIRTS—SHOES—BELT .... white Button Down Oxfords

are still very much de rigeur, and there are handsome variations in
narrow tape stripes of blue, grey, olive. Also, although you ‘can’t
go wrong’ with a white broadcloth tab collar dress shirt, why not
dress up with the newest pale tones of blue, olive or cream. With
suits in Blue or Grey, wear BLACK SHOES or the VERY DARK-
EST BROWNS...and RIB SOCKS are always smart and correct.
Your DRESS BELT is LEATHER with an important harness-type
buckle in polished metal. cS

AT THE SUMMIT—YOUR HAT ... where the

decisions are made, it’s the narrow snap-brim
felt in brown or olive—welt edge, raw edge or
grosgrain-bound,

BIG SWEATER ON CAMPUS—THE CARDIGAN... tne button-

front coat-sweater is tops in campus popularity. Tops in favor are
the lofty Shetland and the open-knit Alpaca wool or wool blends in
solid colors or stripes.

BEACH-BOUND?

    
 

 

Should your vacation find you beached around
Ft. Lauderdale or Bermuda, then sports-
wear moves into number one spot. Here you'll
see a lot of TIGER—the bold, tawny color that’s
getting the roar of approval from campus men
everywhere. They pick it up in sportshirts like
this, sweaters, ties, socks. Find it in sharp, selid
tones or mixed—for example, a houndstooth
sporteoat checked in Black and Tiger... and let
them see you “burning bright” in fashion.

ODK_ 50th

The Secretary of State, two uni-
versity presidents, and a famous
explorer and mountain climber high-
light the list of speakers to appear
at the 50th anniversary national
convention of Omicron Delta Kappa,
honorary leadership society.

Approximately 200 delegates from
110 circles of the society will at-
tend the golden anniversary meet-
ing in Roanoke and Lexington April
23 to 209.

Secretary of State Dean Rusk,
who was tapped for membership in
Omicron Delta Kappa as an under-
graduate at Davidson College, will
give the major address at the con-
vention’s opening convocation
Thursday evening, April 23, at Hotel
Roanoke.

Friday, Avril 24, the convention
will make an all day pilgrimage to
Washington and Lee University,
Lexington, where Omicron Kappa
Delta was founded in 1914.

Dean Rusk To Highlight

Anniversary

a convention luncheon that day in
Evans Dining Hall.

A model initiation service and a
recognition of the founders of the
society will follow in Lee Chapel on
Washington and Lee’s’ campus.
Alumnus Dr. Edgar F. Shannon, Jr.,
president of the University of Vir-
ginia will give the main speech.

The convention closes Saturday
morning with the report of com-
mittees, legislative action and the
election and installation of new of-
ficers.

Before being appointed to his cab-
inet post in 1961 by the late Presi-
dent John F. Kennedy, Secretary
Rusk served as president of the
Rockefeller Foundation for nine
years. Previously he was professor
of political science and government
and Dean of Faculty at Mills College
and held positions in the War De-
partment and Department of State.
He served as an infantry officer in

for president of Fancy Dress.

Delta Tau Delta and Sigma Phi
Epsilon joined the University
Party last night after an unexpect-
ed withdrawal from the Progres-
sive Party.

Their shift drastically altered the
balance of power in campus poli-
tics, adding approximately 110
votes to the University Party and
making it the majority party. The
University Party now has eleven
houses as opposed to the Progres-
sive Party’s seven.

The switching seemly came as
a surprise to both parties. When
the Progressive Party clique meet-
ing broke up at about 1:30 last
night, no one except the Delt and
SPE representatives were aware of
an impending split with the Pro-
gressive Party.

Jim Kulp President

Kulp, a student of the W&L Law
School, is the intermediate law class
representative to the Executive
Committee. He is a member of the
Law Review and of Phi Delta Phi
law fraternity. Kulp was selected
as a member of ODK this year.

Before coming to W&L, Kulp was
an honor student at Hampden-Syd-
ney. There he was elected first as
secretary-treasurer of the student
body, and later as vice president of
the student body. He has sat on the
honor council, and served as presi-
dent of both his social fraternity
and Chi Beta Phi, honorary scientific
fraternity.

DeYoung, Morris, Adams
Named by Revamped Party

The University Party, last night, nominated Jim Kulp, a
second-year law student, as its candidate for president of the
student body. The party, at its clique meeting held at the Beta
house, also nominated Jim DeYoung for student body vice-
president, Malcolm Morris for secretary, and Patton Adams

 

A past president of his social fra-
ternity, DeYoung is a member of the
SWMSFC’s, the Student Service So-
ciety, and the Varsity Club.

De Young is captain of the tennis
team and is the Illinois state dele-
gation chairman of the Mock Con-
vention. He has been a vice pres-
ident of the Fancy Dress Dance Set
for the last two years.

Malcolm Morris Secretary

James Malcolm Morris, a Sig Ep
from Richmond, is an Executive
Committeeman from the junior class
this year. In his sophomore year,
he served as president of his class.

Morris is a member of ODK and
Tau Kappa Alpha, honorary frater-
nities, and is a McElwee Scholarship
holder.

Morris has been a member of the
Dance Board and the Cold Check
Committee. He worked on the Ring-
tum Phi for two years, and was a
Glee Club officer. He presently
serves as secretary of the UCA.

A Dean’s List and Honor Roll
student, Morris is a member of Phi
Eta Sigma. He has held several fra-
ternity offices and is a freshman
dorm counselor this year.

Patton Adams FD President

Thomas Patton Adams, a Pi Phi
junior has been nominated as the
University Party’s Fancy Dress
Presidential candidate. His home is
Columbia, South Carolina.

Adams is chairman of the South
Carolina state delegation for the
Mock Convention. He has served as
an officer of his class, as an officer
of his house, and as an Interfraterni-
ty Councilman. In addition, he has
worked on the Ring-tum Phi.

A Dean’s List student and Robert
E. Lee research scholar, Adams re-
cently won a statewide essay con-
test.

In an interview, University Party
Clique Chairman Al Eckes explained
the reasons for the action of the
Delt and SPE houses: “In the in-
terest of a more capable, highly ex-
perienced student government, the
Delt and SPE houses have realigned
with the University Party.

“The purpose of this movement is
to extend to the student body a
definite choice in the coming elec-
tion for President, Vice-President,
Secretary, of the Student Body and
for the President of Fancy Dress, a
choice in which the University Party
offers capable and experienced can-
didates .

“It is the feeling of both the old
and new members of the University
Party that without this change, the
student body would not have been
confronted with a single or collective
slate of able people who offer both
the experience and stability essential
to those whom we select to govern
and represent the Washington and
Lee Student Body.

“For the above obvious and self-
explanatory reasons, the necessary

 

realignment was accomplished.”

A Modest Proposal

This coming week, as in every previous W&L election,
many constructive ideas and proposals will be projected before
the student body through the platforms of the respective
political parties. However, many of the desperately needed
reforms can be carried out only through a closer liaison of
student body officers and the Board of Trustees. With this in
mind, we'd like to throw out the following as possible platform

issues for ’64.

1. That the new officers sponsor a student petition to be
presented to the trustees at their meeting next month request-
ing that they state their position on segregation.

2. That a report be presented to the trustees giving an hon-
est appraisal of W&L fraternities and recommending the
institution of a long-range plan for their elimination.

3. That the new officers formally request of the trustees
a decent and well-situated Co-op, preferably the remodeling
and re-opening of the Old Co-op. .

4. That the University no-drinking rule be modified to per-
mit the consumption of alcoholic beverages at the University

dances.

 

 

 

Letters To The Editor...

 

 

Dear Sir:

Because Mr. Lewis has ventured
to comment twice on U.S. medical
standards, I will reply briefly to
his remarks on my one column.

Lewis on Durrette: “Mr. Durrette’s
argument implied...our system
should not be changed” and that
“this is analogous to stating that
the Boston Celtics, perennial cham-
pions in the NBA, should not try
to improve, for they are the best
already!” (emphasis added).

Durrette on Durrette: “Let us,
then, work diligently to correct the
imperfections of our system rather
than discard it...”

Note, Mr. Lewis, the difference be-
tween change and improve; appar-
ently it escaped you.

I do not deny that the cost of
medical care has risen, but your
statistical comparison is inaccurate
and incomplete. First, you should
measure medical services against
services in  general—not against
goods and services. The difference
is striking.

Second, most of the cost rise is
concentrated in hospital cost and
thus, hospital insurance. Drugs, pre-
scriptions drugs, doctor’s and den-
tists fees have risen little more than
services over-all for the period you
cited. Considering the “profit hun-
gry” drug industry now spends over
$100 million more per year for re-
search than in 1956, the slight price
increase is phenomenally moderate.

 

Third, most medicines are cheaper
in terms of real cost in the US.,
than they are abroad. That is, an
American worker has to work less
time than his foreign counterpart
to purchase drugs which are priced
higher for him in dollar value.

Finally, in 1939 the average pre-
scription price was $1.11, but it took
the average manufacturing employee
1 hour and 45 minutes of working
time to pay for it. In 1960 the aver-
erage prescription price was $3.00
but it took only 1 hour and 21 min-
utes to pay this price.

Perhaps the rise in hospital cost
is cause for concern, but I cannot
knowledgably comment. However,
expanding, advanced and moderized
services and equipment may be some
justification. Also, as Mr. Lewis indi-
cated in his first column, these fees
are utilized in many areas to sup-
port the medically indigent.

As to the deficiency in “conserva-
tive reasoning” of which my “black
or white” analysis is an example, I
offer this: either socialized medicine
is superior to our system or it is
not. Color it as you will, but the
alternatives are clear. If this is
“black or white reasoning” I plead
guilty.

If you insist on experimenting in
socialized medicine, Mr. Lewis,
please pursue it first on a State level
so that should unfortunate results
follow, your guinea pigs will have

God Is Dead -- Part IIl

 

Reason & the Traditional Church

We discussed in the second part
of our series (March 27) the pre-
carious position of the Church as
its appeal te young people is
seriously diminishing. Below, we
probe behind this and other con-
temporary .symptoms .of  ..the
Church’s ill-health in order to ex-
amine a movement that has be-

come a_ historical landmark of
Christianity’s decline—the Protes-
tant Reformation.
By KEN LANE
Editor-in-Chief

The series of religious, political
and social revolutions we know of
as the Protestant Reformation has
been the decisive impetus for the
advent of the modern world. It
was this era that represented the
transition from the Dark Ages of
dogma and intellectual stalemate to

 

the Renaissance of science and rea-
son, from blind adherence to au-
thority to the spirit of individualism
and independence, from the Church-
dominated, religion-centered exist-
ence under Catholicism to modern-
day secularism and mundane enter-
prise.

Reason and Revelation

A prominent feature of this trans-
ition was that reason began to sup-
ersede divine revelations as _ the
guide to human thought and action.
The Church and the Bible no longer
served as the final answer for the
enquiring. The simple universe
of heaven, hell, and earth suddenly
became excitingly more complex.
From this change of outlook resulted
two significant developments.

The first was the growth of scien-
tific inquiry. Throughout history,

 

Christianity has been, and in many
cases continues to be, in strong op-
position to scientific advance. For
this is the religion that represents
knowledge as a slimy, despicable
snake which, because it had lured
man from his pristine ignorance, had
been the instigating factor of the
world’s evils. It is not surprising,
then, that the Church had sought
to dispel such crucial findings as the
Copernican theory, or that it should
have damned the humanists for
spreading literacy and teaching the
layman how to reason. (This retard-
ing influence of the Church has its
twentieth-century parallel in the
fervid opposition of the clergy to
the theory of organic evolution.)

Loss of Authority
Secondly, the rise of reason began
to undermine the keystone of eccles-

 

 

fo oe
APGAR.

iastical authority. For it was through
its prerogatives over men’s souls
that the Church had exercised pow-
er against any authority that might
compete with it. It could thus frigh-
ten recalcitrants with threats of per-
petual damnation and bind the
amenable with promises of eternal
bliss. As reason sowed the seeds
of skepticism, however, this bond
of authority commenced to dissolve.

The institution that increasingly
supplanted the authority of the
Church was the State, which found
its sanction not in religion but in
nature. “The great and chief end
of men uniting into commonwealths
and putting themselves under gov-
ernment is the preservation of prop-
erty,” stated John Locke. Thus, the
Church and State began to separate
and compartmentalize, each with its
own sphere of interest. The univer-
sal hierarchy of values of the Mid-
dle Ages, with obedience to the
Church at the apex, broke down
into two parallel and different sys-
tems as the criterion of the State
became not religious authority, but
political expidency.

A further development that was
eventually to take all of Christianity
within its mold was the rise of cap-
italism. No system could be more in
contradiction to the original theol-
ogy of Christianity than a creed
based on self-gain at the expense
of one’s fellows .The result is the

striking dichotomy between “the
concept of society as a community
of unequal classes with varying

functions, organized for a common
end, and that which regards it as a
mechanism adjusting itself through
the play of economic motives to the
supply of economic needs; between
the idea that a man must not take
advantage of his neighbor’s neces-
sity, and the doctrine that ‘man’s
self-love is God’s providence,’ be-
tween the attitude which appeals to
a religious standard to repress eco-
nomic appetites, and that which re-
gards expediency as the final cri-
terion.” (Paul Tawney, Religion and
the Rise of Capitalism). Clearly,
Christianity and capitalism could
not coexist without one or the
other making serious compromises in
its underlying credo. Needless to
say, Christianity was the one that
yielded and capitalism won out over
most of the West.

NEXT WEEK: Part four will
take a look at the contemporary
American church,

We continue to welcome letters of
comment on the above from both
faculty and students. All letters in-
cluding ones we have received over
the past weeks will be published in
next Friday’s issue.

 

Mock Convention’s Major Decision:
‘When And If To Drop Goldwater?’

The major question Washington
and Lee University’s Mock Repub-
lican Convention May 4 and 5 faces
is: if and when to leave Goldwater.

Reports from state and national
Republican leaders show the con-
vention’s leaders that Goldwater
now has more votes than any other
GOP presidential hopeful, but no-
body knows if his lead is strong

enough to pull in the undecided
delegations.
Washington and Lee students

themselves have been keeping long
distance telephone lines hot, the
mails full, reading everything they
can get their hands on and even
fanning out across the country dur-
ing spring vacation last week to find
the answer.

In this year of great uncertainty
about the name of the Republican
presidential nominee, the Mock Con-
vention’s long record of accuracy is
facing one of its toughest tests.

Eight Correct

Twelve Mock Conventions have
been held at Washington and Lee in
presidential election years for the
party out of power. Eight times
student delegates have correctly
picked the nominee later chosen by
the national convention.

The Mock Conventions have been
right the last three times, accu-
rately selecting Eisenhower, in 1952,
Stevenson in 1956 and John F. Ken-
nedy in 1960, and for almost a year
now, state delegation chairmen have
been working to insure another ac-
curate prediction May 5.

As the Mock Convention Steering
Committee’s Republican Party Chair-
man, senior law school student
Wyatt Durrette, Jr., has the task of
directing this prediction.

 

National Liasion

Last summer he spent several
weeks in Washington establishing
liaison with Republican national

headquarters and getting letters of
introduction for the 50 Mock Con-
vention state chairmen. The state
chairmen, appointed last spring, be-
gan making contacts with political
leaders in their states last summer.

For example, John Heinzerling, a
senior from Houston, is chairman of
the Texas delegation. Last summer
he met with Marvin Collins, execu-
tive director of the Texas Republi-
can Party who was “a tremendous
amount of help in introducing me to
Republican leaders in Houston, Dal-
las and other parts of the state,”
Heinzerling said.

He added that finding out who
Texas Republicans will vote for
“was not at all much of a problem
because it’s pretty clear cut. Al-
most every Republican in Texas is
extremely conservative and _ for
Goldwater,” he said.

The chief problem Heinzerling |
faces is whether the delegation will
stay with Goldwater all the way
through. “The Republican leaders
are reluctant to give much advice
about a deadlock between Gold-
water and another candidate, but I
generally feel the delegation will

stay with Goldwater all the way
through,” he said.
Maryland for Goldwater
Bill Schildt, a Washington and

Lee senior from Hagerstown, Md.,
approached his chairmanship of the
Mock Convention’s Maryland dele-
gation differently. Last summer he
worked for Rep. Charles Mathias of
the state’s Sixth Congressional Dis-

 

trict which includes everything from

a large District of Columbia Suburb
to rural Western Maryland. Travel-
ing with Rep. Mathias, Schildt “saw
lots of grass roots support for
Goldwater.

“Goldwater is ahead in Maryland
now, but the lead is to be question-
ed because people seem to be look-
ing for someone else to go to. I
think they would like to turn to
Nixon,” he said.

Illinois’ Pick

As chairman of the Mock Con-
vention’s Illinois delegation, Jim
DeYoung, a junior from the Chicago
suburb of Kenilworth, is having
to follow closely the race for the
GOP nomination for governor of
Illinois.

First DeYoung explains that Gold-
water “has strong support down-
state, but Chicago is more vague.”

 

Second he explains that whoever |

captures the GOP nomination for
governor will possibly exert a strong
influence on

tion.

The front runner for this nomina-
tion, Illinois Secretary of State
Charles F. Carpentier, withdrew
from the race in January after suf-
fering a heart attack. He died last
week,

But hours before his death, Car-
pentier wrote a letter to Republi-
can leaders in the state praising
candidate Charles Percy, Chicago
industrialist, and attacking Percy’s
rival as a “voluble young man.”

And from working in Percy’s
campaign last summer, DeYoung
believes Perey prefers Rockefeller.
But so far Percy’s only public state-
ment on this subject says he will

the state’s delegation |
to the Republican National Conven- |

 

support whoever wins the state’s
primary April 14. Goldwater and
Sen. Margaret Chase Smith are the
only candidates entered in the pri-
mary.

And so it goes all across the coun-
try and Washington and Lee “poli-
ticians” are following every shift,
subtle and obvious,

Overall Picture

Looking at the overall picture,
Durrette says he thinks Goldwater
“will have upwards of 400 votes
on the first ballot” at the Mock Con-
vention.

Also Durrette says he is weighing
heavily on two other factors: al-
most no political writers believe
Goldwater has a chance at the
nomination; and while influential
Republicans in the northeast might
not be able to control the nomina-
tior, they perhaps can stop Gold-
wter.

But already Durrette is instruct-
ing Mock Convention's state chair-
men: “Find out what your state
will do if Goldwater starts losing
on the second, third or fourth bal-
lot.

Nobody will know the real an-
swer until the convention actually
nominates a candidate because the
situation will continue to change
right up to the last minute. State
delegation chairmen will have tele-
phones right on the convention
floor with direct lines to their Re-
publican contacts in the states they
represent to receive these last min-
ute instructions.

Then, and only then, will the
Mock Convention and the national
press covering it know “when and if
they’ll leave Goldwater.”

Two Games
Called; Meet
Bridgewater

The Washington and Lee baseball
team returns to action tomorrow
here against Bridgewater, after two
rained-out games this past week.

The Generals were slated to meet
Castleton State and RPI Tuesday
and yesterday. The RPI game will be
played on a date to be announced.

Coach Joe Lyles will start either
Chris Wigert (0-2-1) or Brice Gam-
ber (1-3) against Bridgewater. W&L
has won only one game thus far, and
is 0-3-1 in collegiate competition.

The spring trip saw the Generals
lose six of seven games, due to a
pitcher shortage (only four were
healthy), poor hitting (.185 overall
batting average) and inexperience
(12 of 25 players are freshmen).

The infield was struck a blow
when third-baseman Louie Paterno
(.250 batting average) was forced
to quit because of grades. Lou
Flanagan will switch to third, and
Mike Saunders will replace him at
second.

Ashley Allen leads the team in
hitting, with a 308 average. Catcher
Tom Crenshaw is second at .273.
Wigert leads the pitchers with a
3.04 earned run average.

The Generals have stolen 12
bases against college competition.
Dave Kirkpatrick has five, Allen
three.

Three RBI’s by Jim Crothers and
two by Scott Miller gave W&L the
Fort Lee victory. Gamber went the
distance after pitching three innings
the day before.

Lyles credited balanced fielding,
without the usual passed balls and
wild pitches, for the victory.

Phil pson, who posted a 6-0 record on the varsity’s spring trip, is
here in the process of defeating Virginia Episcopal’s Rip Woodin. Thompson
won 6-2, 6-2; the freshman won yesterday’s match 9-0. Bing Grumbie, Dick
Bradford, Dick Crook, Charlie Lee and Clint Morse won singles matches.

 

Hofstra Down;
Now To Duke

By PAT ADAMS
The Washington and Lee lacrosse
team will meet Duke tomorrow at
Durham, N.C. The Blue Devils are

|| still an unknown quantity so far

as this season is concerned. This
will be their season opener.

Coach Bob McHenry’s team will
have to be “ready for anything”
from Duke, which has had five

=| weeks of preparation to avenge last

year’s 9-3 defeat by the W&L stick-
men.
McHenry said last year’s Blue

‘| Devils lacked stickwork and over-

all team speed. His team is in good
physical condition and has had a
week to rest since the last game,
against Hofstra.

Netters Win
Six on Trip

After losing its first two matches,
the varsity tennis team took six
straight on a spring trip in North
Carolina and Virginia.

A Wednesday match with Hamp-
den-Sydney was postponed because
of rain. The netters return to action
a week from today against Lynch-
burg College.

Number two man John Baker had
been unable to make the trip and
number one man and captain Jim
DeYoung suffered an injury that
kept him out of most of the matches.

 

W&L won that game, played in

Trackmen Beat Tigers;
Kell Boys Take Four Firsts

By JOHNNY GRAHAM

The Washington and Lee track team, defeated in its initial
meet, collected its first victory yesterday with a 89-47 win over
Hampden-Sydney at Death Valley.

Winning 12 of the 16 events, and sweeping the 440 and

880 yard runs, the Generals piled up a commanding lead in the
field events, and were never serious-*

ly challenged.

There were two double winners.
Chris Kell captured both dashes
and brother Robin took the triple
jump and high jump.

Relays Tomorrow

A 30-man squad left Lexington
today for the annual Colonial Re-
lay meet in Williamsburg tomorrow.

Coach Norm Lord has entered
competitors in the seven field events
and five individual running events
as well as the seven relay events.

Top individual entrants are Chris
Kell in the invitational 100-yard
dash and Charlie Head in the 300-
meter steeplechase.

.

Baltimore, 8-4, The Generals showed
a marked improvement, particularly
in the second half, in their ability
to clear and pick up ground balls.

Randy Wootton (three goals) and
Mike Michaeles (2 goals) led the
scoring. Johnny McDaniel picked
up 12 ground balls, roughly com-
parable to grabbing 25 rebounds in
basketball.

McHenry sees his main concern
as keeping up the momentum.

 

 

-M WEEK

- DU gained a berth in the volley-

 

 

ball finals Wednesday night when
they downed PEP 2-0 on games
of 14-4 and 8-3. DU had finished
their league in a three-way tie for
first with PEP and Beta. PEP had
upended Beta earlier, 2-1.

Generals dropped a close 80-65 de-
cision to the Monarchs of Old Do-
minion College.

Although W&L won eight of 17
events, defeats in both relays and
Old Dominion sweeps in three other
events spelled the difference.

Playoff action also got underway
Wednesday night. In the only
game played that night, ZBT de-
feated Phi Kappa Sig. Activity
continued last night with four
games being played. The tourna-
ment will end Monday night.

The I-M Softball season gets un-
derway next week, with the first
games Monday afternoon. Delt is
defending champion.

Freshman shot-putter Gay Gasque
broke the school record in winning
the event with a heave of 46’ 4”. This
betters the mark of 45’ 8” set by
A. B. Platt in 1957.

The Kell brothers led the way,
scoring 18 points between them.
Chris took both sprints, winning the
100 in 10.2, and the 220 in 228.
Robin won the triple jump with a
42’ 9” effort, and took second place
in the high jump.

by Tim OKeefe

The battleship Texas, used as a
target ship by the Army and sunk
in the Chesapeake Bay, has almost

yielded one of its treasurers to
skindivers.

For several years we have been
chartering boats to dive on the

ship, trying to salvage the bronze
propeller from the battlewagon.

We would have succeeded if a
knot hadn’t slipped and if visi-

ibility under water had _ been
better.
Rex Jones, a navy diver, and I

had often planned how we would
raise the propeller. As we swam
slowly over the wreck, searching
for cleats for portholes, we kept a
constant lookout for the propeller.

Since the wreckage had been al-
most leveled to the 30-foot bottom
by an Army demolition crew three
years ago, our chances of finding
any object still in good shape were
slim.

Rex placed his hand on a pro-
truding piece of metal and slowly
swayed back and forth in the
gentle current as he watched me
dig into a pile of rubble.

Of course, it’s for them, toc.

Foreign
Study is for
Language Majors

  
    
 

Only.

But it’s also for undergrads in history, political science,
international relations, economics, psychology, philosophy

and some other fields.

We know. Over half the students in our university centers
in Europe aren't language majors. They're pursuing studies
in their own fields, and giving them a fresh, European di-
mension—without interrupting their college careers.

Foreign study may suit you, too. (It isn’t for everyone.)
This is the time of life when the experience of Europe can
mean most. It will mean most if you use it to deepen and

extend your formal studies.

You might look into it-and learn about our programs, in-
cluding a new one opening next fall at the University of

Madrid.

Our centers don’t offer mere “‘civilization” courses. They
aren't cozy little ‘‘ghettos’’ for Americans. Institute pro-
grams immerse you in a great European university as deeply
as your abilities allow. (We supplement and guide your
studies, as necessary, to make sure they satisfy U. S.

requirements.)

Raising Battleship’s Propeller

(Continued from page 3)

Suddenly he let out a muffled roar
and grabbed my shoulder. He pointed
to the object he had been resting
on. It looked like any other rusty,
sponge-covered ship part. Then I
realized what I was seeing—it was
our much sought-after propeller,
almost unrecognizable in its coating
of grime and marine growth.

The propeller was still on the
shaft. Rex and I tugged and
found to our surprise that the
shaft was loose. After tying a rope
to it, we surfaced.

Two other divers joined us in the
water. I removed the nut holding

adequate medical facilities available

merit, I’m sure that out of 50 states
you can find one willing to try
them.

Meanwhile, I still suggest that you
content yourself with an effort to
improve our free system rather
than institutionalize a “concept”
(quoting your British authority who
obviously was aware of the differ-
ence between theory and practice)
of socialized “utopia” which in prac-
tice has demonstrated its inferiority

propellor to shaft. then we tied an-
other rope and a chain around the
propeller and went back to the
boat. We hoped to use it to pull
off the propeller and raise it.

As the boat strained against the
propeller, we felt something snap
loose. We hauled in the rope and
chain but there was no propeller
tied to its end. A quick underwater
survey showed the propeller had
come off the shaft, but the knot had
slipped and our rope and chain had
come loose.

The propeller had been pulled
some distance from the shaft. Be-
cause it was getting late and the
visibility had dropped to about three
feet, we called off our search until
another time.

SCUBA gear, get in touch with me.

Campaign Highlighted By Par

Kulp Asserts
Age Is Asset
In Debate

Big Four candidates from both
parties met head-on last night in a
debate in duPont Auditorium.

UP candidate Jim Kulp opened the
debate with a talk dealing primarily
with his ability, in spite of law
school status, to represent the inter-
ests of the undergraduate student
body. Kulp also stressed how im-
portant W&L’s traditions and their
preservation were ‘to him.

“As an EC member this year,”
Kulp said, “I have attempted to
acquaint myself with the workings
of the student government here.”

Hitting at criticisms which have
been leveled at him as an older
person, Kulp declared, “My age is
an asset, and it would lend ma-
turity of judgment, I hope, to my
decisions as student body presi-
dent.”

He admitted he thought “some
problems do exist in our student
government,” cited EC-student re-
lations as one of the chief prob-
lems. Confessing that “I don’t have
the answers to the problems,” Kulp
made clear his intentions to seek
solutions.

Progressive candidate Lamar
Lamb, in his initial speech, told the
audience what he thought the EC’s
function was. “On the one hand, we
have our student body,” he said,
“and on the other, the traditions
and ideals that W&L stands for.
Properly, the student government
correlates the two, serving as the
liaison between the institutions of
the University and the student
body.”

Lamb said that each member of
the EC should seek “to represent
that which is best in our institu-
tions, and to represent student
opinions in the interpretation of

 

these institutions.”

He took a stand clearly in favor
of more equalized party politics, and
quoted both party chairmen as say-
ing they would like to see the un-
equal party line-up changed.

Steve Smith, Progressive candi-
date, was first vice-presidential
hopeful to speak.

Smith stressed the fact that the
Progressives were campaigning on
a policy of more truly representa-
tive government on the EC.

DeYoung concentrated on the |
worth of the UP platform. He gave
special attention to the two planks
dealing with the student opinion
poll and monthly class officer meet-
ings.

UP candidate for secretary Mal-
colm Morris spent most of his time
on the problem of communication
existing between the EC and the
student body. He emphasized two
means of alleviating the problem:
better information on the Honor
System, “maybe reporting exactly
what happens” in the case of viola-
tions, and publishing EC agenda and
posting HC minutes.

Brooks Brown, Morris’s opponent
based his speech on the Progressive
platform, pointing out plank by
plank how it would best serve the
student body.

Following speeches by each of the
candidates was a question and an-
swer period.

Kulp, when asked what changes
in the present assimilation policy
he would favor, answered that
“Myself, I know there are prob-
lems, but I don’t have any an-
swers, Maybe we could run a stu-
dent poll to get suggestions,” he
added.

Lamb, who a year ago suggested
the idea of graduated penalties in
honor violations, was asked to elab-
orate on why his mind had changed,
and if he would guarantee that it
would not change again. He an-
swered that he had “expressed a
certain need last year for certain
flexibility in the punishment; but
more flexibility brings up two
problems: first of all, it is impos-
sible to decide who should receive
the lighter penalty, and secondly, a

Independents To Support
Lamb, Smith, And Morris

The Independent Union,

meeting at 6:30 last night,

gave their support to Lamar Lamb for president, Steve Smith
for vice-president, and Malcolm Morris for secretary of the

student body.

However, a spokesman for the Independents pointed out
that these endorsements were made by the recommendation of

the Independent Steering Committee*¥

after several meetings with all the
candidates from both parties, and
later verified by a hand-vote of the
non-fraternity body last night.

The Independents were urged to
vote for the candidates they per-
sonally preferred, although the en-
dorsed ones were thought to be best
for the school and most helpful in
NFU objectives. In making their de-
cision, they broke party lines and
emphasized importance of the indi-
vidual over party.

By a hand vote the members de-
feated a motion to endorse a candi-
date for president of Fancy Dress.
The steering committee also failed to
endorse a candidate.

Convening in the Student Union,
the candidates of both parties were
subjected to questions from the
floor.

When asked about the possibility
of change in the Honor System,
Lamb said he favored continual
midification if it were both neces-
sary and for the betterment of the
system. He feared the system’s be-
coming stagnant in tradition, and
proposed an EC subcommittee to ex-
amine honor systems throughout the |
country and study possible improve-
ments.

 

Kulp responded to Lamb’s state-
ment by saying, “We are not in the

 

least to try to stay with what we
have...we are going to seek infor-
mation.” However, he failed to issue
any definte plans.

Both vice-presidential candidates
proposed identical platforms, stress-
ing town-school relations and stu-
dent body EC liaison.

The candidates for secretary both
emphasized the need for published
EC minutes, and open meetings, al-
though there was a brief misunder-
standing as to whether a large
crowd would be advisable at meet-
ings.

After an accusation by the UP
that the Progressives feared certain
individuals at meetings, Brooks
Brown clarified the issue by pointing
out that he didn’t favor large crowds
at EC meetings because of the ob-
vious hindrance and retarding of
EC business.

In closing the interview, each
candidate gave a brief speech. Lamb
emphasized that, being a non-frater-
nity man himself, he realized the
Independents would have to help
themselves in their endeavors and
could not expect the EC to achieve
their gains for them. In doing this,
he made it clear that he would not
encourage votes if the voters ex-
pected special favor in return.

Jim Kulp repeated this view

 

y Switch

A ‘Dead Issue’ Rears Its Ugly Head:
Big Clique Domination May Return

The most interesting feature of
this year’s Big Four election is that
of the new political parties result-
ing from the Delt-SPE switch.

Depending on the outcome, the
election will prove either that party
ties and straight-ticket voting is
a defunct thing of the past, or that
Big Clique politics and one-party
domination has returned to the

* campus after a short interlude of a

more or
system.

The revolt of the two Progressive
Party houses is understandable
when viewed in context of the past
couple of years. Both Delts and
SPE’s have a history of breaking
party ranks.

First SPE Switch

Two years ago, the SPE’s, only
three years old but aspiring to po-
litical potency, deserted the old In-
dependent Party to join the domi-
nate UP. SPE ascension to the Big
Clique left the Independents with
only seven houses and even more of
a political cripple than it had been
before.

The imbalance in parties contin-
ued until February, 1963, when a
coalition of five former University
and four Independent Party houses
sought to equalize the party system
by formation of the Progressive
Party. The SPE’s and the Delts were
among the nine houses which made
the move.

less balanced two-party

 

Delt Dissension

The new party, although at last
bringing a measure of equality to
the party system, lacked the stability
of the old UP. In the first election
in which the Progressives partici-
pated—last year’s Big Four—Delt
dissension was its biggest headache.

A Delt nominated the UP candi-
date for president, and actively cam-
paigned against the candidate from
his own party.

UP Must Win

If the present coalition is to con-
tinue, it is extremely important for
the UP to sweep the Big Four this
week and to take a sizeable number
of class officers next month.

It can do both—if it can manage
somehow to hold together its eleven
houses and manufacture party loy-
alty, and to recreate the straight-
ticket voting that prevailed in the
heyday of UP dominance.

Thus the present election is cru-
cial to the UP; if they lose, it will
mean in effect that party ties are
untenable and that the old system
cannot be revived. They know this,
and are running a furious, intense
campaign.

Influence of NFU and Law

The law and non-fraternity stu-
dents will have some effect on the
election, but chances are they will
negate each other. In all probabili-
ty, the UP will carry the law school

Both Political Parties Emphasize
Role Of EC And Honor System

The platforms of both the Uni-
versity and Progressive parties seem
directed towards a more represen-
tative student government than now
exists. They have three mutual con-
cerns: the Honor System, Freshmen,
and the acquainting of the student
body with the results of EC meet-
ings. From proposals on these sub-
jects they go on to widely diver-
sified planks and affirmations, such
as the PP’s plan to petition for use

of alcoholic beverages at University
dances to the UP’s statement of be-
lief in the Assimilation Committee.

Both platforms agree that the
Honor System is “structurally
sound.” In addition, both feel
measures should be taken to bet-
ter educate the student body as
to it’s functioning. However, the
University Party platform fails to
disclose how it intends to ac-
complish this, while the Progres-
sive platform specifies two ways
in which it would carry out this
measure, in addition to calling
for “continued reappraisal” in or-
der to insure that the system re-
mains just.

Both parties attempt to carry the
freshman vote. The Progressive
platform proposes an open primary
to enable the freshman class to
choose an EC member representative
of them, instead of political cliques.
The University Party favors a “con-
stitutional change creating fresh-
man class officers.”

The UP Platform promises to pub-
lish agendas and minutes of each
EC meeting in order to acquaint
the students with the results of
their deliberations. The Progressive
Party, going a step further, sup-
ports open meetings of the EC in
addition to promising to publish the
votes of each member on each issue.

Aside from these issues, the Pro-
gressive Party promises to seek per-
mission “for the regulated use of
alcoholic beverages at University
Dance functions’ by the use of
drink tickets; to rewrite the consti-
tution to remove ambiguities and
contradictions without altering its
basic structure; and pledges support
of the IFC’s projected plans for
“Contact” weekend.

The University Party includes four
additional planks. Besides their sup-
port of the Assimilation Committee,
they would require monthly meet-
ings of the class officers, conduct
interviews with prospective commit-
tee appointees, and conduct campus-
wide opinion polls when in doubt
about “controversial questions.”

 

Students Asked To Ratify
Constitutional Changes
In Thursday’s Balloting

Thursday, students will be
to ratify two constitutional amend-
ments when they vote for Big Four
officers.

The first amendment provides for
the EC, upon two-thirds vote in
two consecutive meetings, to alter
the prescribed date of class elections
as specified in the constitution.

The constitution now says
class elections be held on the
Monday in May. This year,
ample, Mock Convention
that date.

The second change is designed to
fill the void in the constitution per-
taining to placement of students
entering school at times other than
September. This amendment speci-
fies that a late-entering student
will be placed in the class according
to his placement as set by the Reg-
istrar.

Both amendments were
unanimously by the EC

asked

for ex-|

 

because of Kulp. Since law students
are largely out of touch with the
undergraduate situation, they will
likely vote straight UP rather than
choose among candidates they don’t
know anyway.

The bulk of the Independent vote
will go to the Progressives. They
will, most spokesman from both
parties agree, support Lamb and
Smith as well as Kreitler, and will
depart from the Progressives only
in the case of Morris.

Individuals and Issues

If the Progressives are to win,
they must do it on the basis of in-
dividuals and issues, not party ties.
They know this, and are thus cen-
tering their campaign around quali-
fications of candidates, platforms,
and individual competence.

In the presidential race, Lamb's
strong point is his experience and
direct contact with the student body.
Though he must fight against the
UP majority, he has in his favor
both his undergraduate status and
his active participation as an EC
member for two years.

Kulp’s Biggest Weakness

Kulp must somehow overcome
law school status. He also has to
convince students that he can be-
come sufficiently acquainted with
the undergraduate community
(which is radically different from the
law school) to serve as its presi-
dent. Kulp’s biggest weakness—
law school membership, and_ its
consequent separation from the rest
of the University—is augmented by
the fact that he attended Hampden-
Sydney as an undergraduate. Nearly
all of his qualifications were earned
there and consequently hold little
weight at W&lL, critics contend.

Kulp does have the argument of
maturity in his favor, since at 30 he
is at least ten years older than the
average undergraduate; however,
some Progressives are bound to use
this as a point of criticism, hold-
ing that a man of Kulp’s age would
be unable to best represent the in-
terest of a much younger student
body.

Cleanth Brooks
Lectures For

Phi Beta Kappa

Cleanth Brooks addressed the
Cincinnati Society-Phi Beta Kappa
assembly yesterday on “American
Innocence as Viewed by Henry
James, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Wil-
liam Faulkner.” Taking a book by
each author, Mr. Brooks examined
and compared the major characters

 

of each one, and endeavored to
show the “American Innocence” in
each.

In James The American, as in

Fitagerald’s The Great Gatsby, he
showed that both Christopher New-
man and Jay Gatsby were self-
made men, not only in material con-
sideration, but in that they created

| their own personalities.

‘Elephantiasis of the Will
These personalities tended to have
“elephantiasis of the will,” and fore-
ed so much self absorption that they

| could not grasp reality.

Here, too, is Faulkner's Thomas
Sutpen from Absalom, Absalom! He
creates his own world, develops it
on his own time schedule, and has
what the poet Yeats described as

the monstrous innocence of nature.
He is like Newman and Gatsby in
that his self-absorption buries him
away from reality, but his inno-
cence is of a different sort

Mr. Brooks described it as Yeats
did—a monstrous innocence, like
that of nature, which acts without
'choice, and for itself; whereas,

Gatsby and Newman envision a pla-
tonic existence of more sacrifice.
They do not realize that the world
they have created is apart from
the world of others and cannot be

Campus Politics

As election day approaches, the din of party politics grows :

louder, candidates smile bigger, issues grow foggier, and the
poor befuddled voter becomes more confused than ever.

This issue of the Ring-tum Phi is devoted to the conscien-
tious student—the one who wants to know the issues involved
and the candidates running, the one who refuses to let a blind,
straight-ticket party vote relieve him of the responsibility of

decision.
For that reason, we have

given over almost this entire

issue to the coming elections. We hold no party lines, nor do
we endorse any candidates. We have our preferences, of course,
but above all else we’d like to see the student body making
up its own mind, with all the facts at hand.

We have attempted to cover as thoroughly and as ob-
jectively as possible the developments so far, and to shed
some light on implications of various actions in the future.

The first page contains a comparison of party platforms,
a synopsis of political events leading to the present, a review
of last night’s debates, and a schedule of coming events. On
the second page we present each of the Big Three candidates
and their personal, unedited views.

Here, then, are the candidates and the issues. Examine
them carefully, and judge for yourselves what decisions are

the best ones on Thursday.

   

BROOKS BROWN
Progressive Candidate

 

 

for Student Body Secretary

MALCOLM MORRIS

University Candidate
for Student Body Secretary

Brown, Morris Vie for Post
Of Student Body Secretary

As Progressive Party candidate
for secretary of the student body, I
am running on a ticket that in-
cludes Lamar Lamb for president
and Steve Smith for vice-president
and Dick Kreitler for president of
Fancy Dress. I am not, however,
running against Jim Kulp nor am I
running against Jim DeYoung. I am
competing with Malcolm Morris.
Here, then, is where the issue lies—
not between the two candidates for
president nor between those for
vice-president. The issue is between
the views of Malcolm Morris and
myself. I am, therefore, taking this
time to present to the student body
my specific views on certain essen-
tial issues in order that they may
be compared to those of my op-
ponent.

EC—Student Liaison

First of all, I believe that an
increased liaison between the Ex-
ecutive Committee and the student
body through a system of reporting
and possibly open legislative meet-
ings to permit a more complete in-
surance of accurate representation
of student body opinion in legisla-
tive matters should be investigated.

Secondly, I believe that, through
an emphasis on the personal value
of and need for honor and for an
honor system, the feeling of fear
which shrouds our present system
will be greatly diminished and
hopefully replaced by one of un-
derstanding.

Thirdly, I believe that the use of
alcohol, strictly regulated, at the
Fancy Dress Ball would increase
both attendance and financial sup-
port of that function thus returning
it to its proper place among the tra-
ditions of the University.

IFC Should Be Lauded

Fourthly, the LF.C. should be con-
gratulated and encouraged to con-
tinue its efforts towards an increased
self-government by the students and
its efforts to encourage intellectual
stimulation as manifested in Con-
tact.

Fifthly, freshman representation
on student government committees
should be continued and expanded

(Continued on page 4)

 

One of the greatest problems in
student government during _ this
past year has been a lack of com-
munication ‘between the student
body and the Executive Committee.
This has been a serious impedi-
ment to the effectiveness of the
Executive Committee and has per-
haps hampered its actions as a
truly representative body. Certainly
the twelve men on the Executive
Committee could not produce all the
ideas which are needed to insure
an effective student government.
Just as certainly, student body opin-
ions and ideas are useless unless
they are communicated and made
known.

Communication ‘Must Exist’

As a candidate for Secretary of
the Student Body, I am particularly
concerned with this lack of com-
munication, for I believe that in
order to preserve a representative
and effective student government
this communication must exist. It is
for this reason that Jim Kulp, Jim
DeYoung, and I have included in
our platform proposals specifically
designed to alleviate this problem.

In the first plank of the Univer-
sity Platform we state that the stu-
dent body should be better informed
as to the workings of the honor
system. A major step in this di-
rection would be a more detailed
statement following honor system
violations. This would serve not
only to inform the student body,
but also to prevent accompanying
rumors which distort the functions
and purposes of the honor system.

Platform Plans Discussed

The third plank, dealing with
the creation of Freshman Class of-
ficers, and the fourth plank dealing
with monthly meetings of class of-
ficers are designed to facilitate this
communication. Increased repre
sentation in the Freshman Class,
coupled with the periodic meetings
of all class officers, will constitute
available channels along which ideas
may be effectively communicated
from the individual students to the
Executive Committee.

The fifth plank provides for pub-

Progressive Candidate
for Student Body President

Candidates

In a major campaign it is always
difficult, especially for the candidates
themselves, to keep in mind the
really important considerations of
the elections. Too many times the
platitudinous, non-offensive  plat-
forms and the mechanical aspects of
voter organization take up all the
time and attention, while the really
important considerations of the office
and the real qualifications of the
candidates are unfortunately ig-
nored.

So, for just a moment, I ask you
to put aside fraternal and party con-
siderations—though to a limited de-
gree these are certainly valid con-
siderations—and think with me
about the actual office of President
of the Student Body.

The Constitution provides an out-
line of the duties for the President.
I want to cite them and show how,
in every instance, I will be a better
President than my opponent:

1. “The President shall preside
over all meetings of the Student
Body and the Executive Committee.”
I have spent two years on the EC.
During this time, I have participated
in probably over 80 honor trials. My
opponent has been on the EC one
year. This is my third year as a
student at Washington and Lee;
during this time, I have become ac-
quainted with the workings of near-
ly every organization on campus.
My opponent, in his second year at
W&L, has lived in the relative iso-
lation of the Law School.

2. “He shall appoint all special
committees, subject to the approval
of the EC.” The special committees
are, and should be, almost com-
pletely made up of undergraduate
students—students whom my op-
ponent has no possible way of
knowing. To be sure, it is true that
the EC usually serves a very ac-
tive advisory role in the selection of
committees. But this is an area in
which the President must take
leadership. It is an area in which
I can take leadership, and my op-
ponent cannot possibly do so. Fur-
thermore, I have a wide knowledge
of the Student Body and will be

Experience, W&L Traditions Are Stressed

I wish to take this opportunity to
express my profound appreciation to
the University Party for the confi-
dence they have shown in me by
nominating me as their candidate
for President of the Student Body.
Furthermore, I want to thank each
and every person who has given of
his time and effort on my behalf in
this campaign.

Since coming to this university
two years ago, I have become ac-
quainted with the various activities
on this campus and have tried to
become an integral part of Wash-
ington and Lee. Having served as a
member of the Executive Committee
this year, I have become familiar
with the inner workings of the
Student Government. I feel that this
has given me an insight of all the
duties of student body president—
legislative, executive, and judicial.

Age Is an Asset

As a law student I am older than
many of you, but as a member of
the student body, I find the same
problems which affect you also af-
fect me. Some may claim that these
factors would limit my effectiveness
as President of the Student Body.
I think that they are assets, not lia-
bilities. I hope and think that these
qualifications will help me to exert
a stabilizing influence and a maturi-
ty of judgment to the problems
which will confront us as students
next year.

Washington and Lee has endowed
us with many traditions: an honor
system, conventional dress, and a
speaking tradition. We are the care-
takers of these traditions—not only
for those who have gone before us,
but also for those who will follow
us. It is incumbent upon each of us
to preserve these traditions.

In doing this, we must remain
open to positive, constructive change.
Radical proposals which threaten
the honor system, and conventional
dress, must be rejected. We must not
destroy our heritage.

Chem Library Dedicated

A memorial to a Washington and
Lee student who drowned last year
was presented to the University
Sunday.

The memorial—furnishings for the
Chemistry Department Library—
honors Theodore Thompson, Jr., who
drowned in March, 1963 in the flood-
swollen Maurey River at Goshen
Pass while attempting to ride rapids
of the river in an inner tube.

The memorial was presented by
the University’s chapter of Kappa
Alpha Order of which Thompson
was a member.

Dr. E. S. Gilreath, chairman of
the chemistry department in which
Thompson was a pre-medical major,
called him an “excellent student
with one of the most engaging per-
sonalities I’ve ever known.”

Arthus Broadus, president of Kap-
pa Alpha, presented a plaque for
the chemistry library with the in-
scription: “This room furnished in
memory of Theodore Thompson, Jr.,
65, 1942-1963, by Alpha Chapter,
Kappa Alpha Order.”

Broadus termed Thompson “a
dedicated student of science as well
as a dedicated brother of Kappa
Alpha so it is fitting that we make
this gift, however small, in his
memory.”

Accepting the gift for the Univer-
sity, President Fred C. Cole said it
was his hope that “through this

 

memorial gift many students will
be reminded of the vigor with which
one student approached his study.”

The office of Vice President of the
Student Body is one which demands
a great deal from the student who
holds it. It demands that he serve
as the second officer on the honor
council which is entrusted with
the duty of judging some of his
fellow students. It demands that he
be prepared to fulfill the duties of
the President if this becomes neces-
sary. It gives him the management
of the Student Body Funds, making
him responsible for the disburse-
ments of the student government
and publications.

More Representative EC

However, there is yet a great deal
more which an energetic vice presi-
dent can do on the Executive Com-
mittee. It is the aim of the Pro-
gressive Party to make the EC more
representative, and if I am elected
I will take pains to seek out student
opinion and to express it to the
president and to the entire EC.
Because the president may have too
many other duties to be able to de-
termine student opinion, I believe
that the vice president should accept
this responsibility. With the vice
president making conscious efforts to
refer student thinking to the EC,
this body would become more re-
sponsive to the students in its poli-
cies.

A second duty which I hope to
perform if elected vice president,
is that of student representative to
the faculty and administration, a job
to which the vice president is nor-
mally appointed by the president.
I would take an active part in
bringing student feelings before the
faculty and in representing to the
administration the ideas of the stu-
dent ‘body.

Better Town Relations

A third duty I would undertake
if elected is to help promote better
student-town relations. As treasurer
of the student government, the vice
president can undertake this respon-
sibility naturally, since most deal-
ings between students and town
concern Lexington’s merchants. I
am acquainted with a number of

An Open Letter to the Student

Body:

It is a matter of record that the
character of Washington and Lee is
widely knowned and admired. An
examination of Who’s Who, for in-
stance, shows a high number of
W&L graduates. This leads one to
believe that the preservation of
this character is an essential task
of our student government. The
University Party is offering for
your consideration a slate of candi-
dates—and a platform which rec-
ognizes this preservation as_ their
primary obligation to the Student
Body.

‘For the Preservation of Structure’

The platform which Jim Kulp,
Malcolm Morris and I have drawn
up and endorsed provides specifi-
cally for the preservation of W&L’s
essential character and_ structure.
Furthermore, we allow for a certain
desirable medium of flexibility in
the implementation and expression
of our traditions and attitudes. Each
of us strongly believes in this plat-
form, not because we are candidates
running together, but because it
expresses our own individual ideals.

What will I as Vice-President do
to carry out these ideals? Of course,
my first duty is to replace the Pres-
ident in case of his absence, and to
manage disbursements of Student
Body funds, subject to the approv-
al of the Executive Committee. But
in light of our particular ideals, we
conceive the Vice-President as a
co-ordinator of our proposed Stu-
dent Body Opinion poll. While
I strongly ‘believe that the leg-
islative powers of the Student
Body should remain vested in the
Executive Committee, the opinion of
the Student Body should be known
by the Committee. The Vice-Presi-
dency will ‘thus become an import-
ant co-ordinator between the Ex-
ecutive Committee and the Student
Body. I feel that I can provide this
co-ordination. 1 have represented my
fraternity in the LF.C. for a year,
and I am on the O.D.K. leadership
forum steering committee. In these

The following letter was sent to
the editor of the R-t P by Thomas L.
Maynard, Assistant Principal of the
recently formed Prince Edward Free
School Association. The letter is in
recognition of the services of Dr.
Milton Colvin, W&L political science
professor, to the Association.

The Prince Edward Free School
Association was formed last summer
under the leadership of former Vir-
ginia governor Colgate Darden. The
main purpose of the organization is
to provide schooling for the 1700-odd
Negro children who have not been
going to school since the public
schools in Prince Edward County
closed several years ago.

Dr. Colvin has been serving “per-
iodically” as a civics instructor at
the school since its inception this
last fall. He is one of the few teach-
ers there not on a salary. Dr. Col-
vin has made it clear that his par-
ticipation in the Prince Edward
Free School Association was due to
his belief that all American children
should be in school, not to any par-
ticular racial belief.

—The Editor
Dear Sir:

A famous quotation from Robert
E. Lee directs parents to “forget
local animosities; teach your sons
to be Americans.”

Probably one of the most difficult
jobs for any citizen is to guide peo-
ple in the dull cold path of peace-
able acquiescence to laws that how-

 

Letters To The Editor .. .

ever just and however widely ac-
cepted by a democratic majority of
our country, nevertheless may seem
quite foreign to some of these peo-
ple’s years of upbringing and earlier
social culture.

Such a work must eventually fall
to the lot of the leaders of many
of our country’s younger genera-
tion; just such a labor did General
Lee perform; and such must con-
tinue to be the work of others now
and of many yet to come.

With the surging forward intel-
lectually, socially, economically of
the twenty million American Neg-
roes, with the clamoring for fair
treatment (and is it not healthily
American?) by other minority
groups such as our American In-
dians and Latin-Americans through-
out of the land, it behooves all of us
who can, to strive so as to help make
sure that justice and equality of op-
portunity come within reach of all
our fellow citizens.

This letter is written to thank one
of your faculty, Dr. Milton Colvin,
for his generous contribution of time
and energy, together with some fi-
nancial sacrifice, to help us here at
Prince Edward Free School Asso-
ciation in our job to assist the un-
derprivileged on the road to their
American Dream.

And is it not our dream too?!

Sincerely yours,

THOMAS L. MAYNARD
Assistant Principal

It’s a big event for a school with non-subsidized athletics to
conquer a school that is nationally prominent for its superior
athletic teams. The big day for Washington and Lee was
Saturday as the Generals routed the Duke Blue Devils of the
Atlantic Coast Conference, 15-0, in lacrosse. Duke which
is best known this year for its basketball team and as a peren-

9-1 score from Bridgewater College giving the Generals an-
other loss and leaving them still in search of their first collegiate

victory.

Two big innings, the third

and the eighth, accounted for

all of Bridgewater’s runs. In the third only three of the six

runs scored were earned, while a*
home-run in the eighth with two
men on due to walks resulted in
three more earned runs.

Bridgewater collected only six
hits as did the Generals who failed
to group their hits like their op-
ponents did, though. This sad fact
was painfully obvious in the second
inning when W&L had the bases
loaded with only one out and yet
failed to score. According to the sta-
tistics, the Generals left 13 men on
base.

Lyles Hopes for Good Weather

Coach Lyles made no excuse for
the Generals but only hoped that
more favorable weather would allow
him time to jell his young club.
Lyles cited the relief pitching of
frosh Jim Cooper and the infield
play of Dave Kirkpatrick and Mike
Saunders, who accounted for several
good plays in Saturday’s contest.
Wednesday, W&L travels to Lynch-
burg and hopes to start their bats
booming with more frequency and
ferocity.

Baseball Hopes
Lie In Hurlers

Most professional baseball man-
agers agree that pitching is the most
important facet of baseball. You
cannot win games consistently with-
out good pitching.

This year the Generals appear to
be lacking the big power hitters of
last year and thus must count on
the pitching to aid them in the close
low scoring games.

The two southpaws who will prob-
ably bear the brunt of the hurling
load are Chris Wigert, a junior from
Sparta, New Jersey, and Brice
Gamber, a senior from Baltimore.

Wigert was the leading winner on
the staff last year and will prob-
ably retain the number one spot
again. “Dumbo,” as he is affection-
ately called by his teammates, relies
on the usual repertoire of a fast ball,
a curve, and an occasional knuckle-
ball. He throws all three pitches ef-
fectively. Coach Lyles is expecting
a good season from Wigert, who, by
the way, was the leading RBI man
on the team last year.

Gamber is starting his fourth year
of varsity without ever having
come out on the winning side of
the ledger. Gamber has pitched well
enough to win on many occasions,
but does not seem to know what

 

*nial football power, has had many
great lacrosse teams, but this year’s
squad is evidentally not going to
one of those great one.

As for the Generals, they appear to
have one of their strongest teams
in recent seasons. They have de-
feated Hofstra and Duke and lost
to a tough Williams team.

The Duke game remained close
for one quarter, but the Generals
broke it open in the second period
with four goals to give them a 6-0
halftime margin. They added three
goals in the third period and six in
the last stanza to complete the job.

Second Period Splurge

Mike Michaeles and Randy Woot-
ton scored three goals each to pace
the attack. Carroll Klingelhofer
| scored two, plus three assists. Single
goals were tallied by John McDaniel,
Bob Hankey, Pat Robertson, Doug
Morrison. Jay Bowersox, Bob Frost,
and Butch West.

Statistics show the lopsidedness
of the game. The Generals took
73 shots at their host’s goal, while
the Blue Devils managed only 16.
The defense, led by Bill Gossman
and freshmen Ted Leach and Lance
Bendann, either prevented the shots
or just relieved the loser’s attack-
men of the ball. Goalies Pete Noonan
and John Eddy Moore had little
work to do. Noonan made three

Future Of Campus Politics
To Be Determined In Elections

(Continued from page 1)

paigns which play a part in every
W&L election constitute another
hurdle in the path of a Lamb vic-
tory; he must fight against accusa-
tions of radicalism, claims that he
wants to “destroy the Honor Sys-
tem,” and other equally naive, but
nevertheless influential tales.

This is a point Kulp definitely has
over Lamb. In his year and a half at
W&L, he has remained in relative
anonymity beyond the law school.
Little is known of his personal life;
and, except for his statements dur-
ing election time, his position on
issues has been unknown. Thus he
enters the race with a clean slate,
and will win or lose on the basis
of impressions he makes this week.

Lamb and the Freshmen

One of Lamb’s strong points seems
not to be so favorable to him after
all: the freshman class. His ex-
treme popularity with freshmen had
been a sore point with UP leaders.
However, concentrated efforts by Big
Clique houses to indoctrinate the
ideas of straight-party voting seem
to have succeeded. Freshmen, for
the first time since the demise of the
old UP, are thinking in terms of
house dictates.

They have apparently been con-
vinced of the worth of voting
straight party, regardless of candi-
dates.

Another point that has weakened
Lamb with freshmen is insistence by
UP politicians that his friendliness
and receptiveness to them since Sep-
‘tember has been a carefully designed
plot on his part to court their votes
for this election.

De Young and Smith

In the case of the vice presidential
race, Smith and DeYoung are fight-
ing a hard campaign. DeYoung, be-
cause of the huge UP vote majority,
seems to have the edge at present.
Although Smith won the endorse-
ment of the non-fraternity steering
committee, a hand vote of the Inde-
pendents indicated that it is almost
an even split between him and
DeYoung for the non-fraternity fac-
tion.

Malcolm Morris is apparently
running ahead of Brooks Brown by
a comfortable margin. In addition to
the vote majority he enjoys by Big
Clique membership, his support by
the non-fraternity students is al-
most unanimous.

Kreitler Leads FD Race

In the race for Fancy Dress pres-
ident, Kreitler seems to be the most
popular candidate. As with his run-
ning mates, however, he must some-
how surmount the threat of straight-
party balloting by the UP. He and
Adams are both strong with the In-

dependents, with Kreitler probably
taking the lead there.

All in all, the University Party
seems to be in a better position than
the Progressives. They have the
enormous imbalance of party votes
in their favor, and they seem to be
maintaining the party line dictum.
As a UP spokesman put it, “All we
have to do to win this election is
to see that all our boys vote straight
party, regardless of personal feel-
ings or anything else. And we're
doing that.”

lighter penalty might cause greater
temptation to violate the Honor
System.

Continuing, he said, “I thought
for months about the graduated pen-
alty idea before coming to the con-
clusion that it isn’t possible. But

 

while I feel confident that I shall
not return to this idea now that I
have discarded it, I cannot guaran- |
tee that my mind is set, permanent-
ly, on this or any other issue; I
certainly hope my mind ean still
change, in light of new information
and situations. I believe any think-
ing person’s mind is open to change.”

saves, while Moore stopped five
shots.

The outstanding players in the
game were McDaniel and Robertson.
McDaniel recovered 15 ground balls,
which, in layman’s terms, is pick-
ing up loose balls. Robertson re-
covered 11. McDaniel had tough
luck with his shots, but did get a
goal and two assists.

The victory, in short, could be
attributed to ball control. The Gen-
erals had a definite advantage in that
they recovered about 80 per cent of
the ground balls.

The greatest advantage of this
game was that Coach Bob McHenry
was able to insert all of his reserves.
Thus, the freshmen and sophomores
received necessary game experience.

The Generals play hosts to Villa-
nova Saturday. The Wildcats bring
with them a 1-3 record, but have
returning most of last year’s team,
which compiled a 6-5 mark. The
Pennsylvania team has been hurt by
injuries thus far this season.

speak with sincerity in saying that
I have the qualifications and proven
ability to carry them out. In the
past I have served as secretary of
my class for two years, served as
vice-president of Springs Dance Set
in charge of the cocktail party,
worked closely with the LF.C. for
two years, and am presently serving
as President of Kappa Sigma. Among
other things, I was selected out-
standing freshman, played varsity
baseball, and presently hold a schol-
arship.

It is my earnest belief that active
increased student government par-
ticipation in University direction is
the key to a successful future for
Washington and Lee. It is with these
qualifications and toward these ends,

| then, that I intend to work; and, I

do, therefore, submit to you that I
am the most qualified to serve in
this position the best of your in-
terests as a student body.

able fairly and knowledgeably to
lead in the selection of committees.

3. “He shall have the power...
to do anything necessary to promote
the best interest of the Student
Body.” This purposefully vague sec-
tion assumes that the President will
have an accurate idea of just what
the “best interest of the Student
Body” is. But can we assume that
a man who has connection with only
one tenth of the student body can
possibly have any idea of what is
in the best interest of the Student
Body? I, on the other hand, am a
non-fraternity student who is a so-
cial member of a fraternity and a
dorm counselor. Therefore, I have
wide contacts with students and
can be sensitive to the problems and
opinions of the Student Body.

I think that this analysis of ‘the
duties of the office I seek should
show decisively that I am the bet-
ter candidate for the office. I hope
that you have read and studied the
platforms of the two parties. I think
that in the Progressive Party Plat-
form I have expressed ideas which
will make gradual improvements in
our student government while pre-
serving the traditions of our school.

More Open EC

In particular, I am anxious to see
the EC somewhat more open in
legislative matters. To this end, I
have suggested publication of the
votes of members of the BC and

open meetings in which key issues
are to be debated.

The need for open primaries for
choosing freshman EC representa-
tives should be apparent to anyone
who is aware of the usually super-
ficial and completely political meth-
ods presently employed in selection
of nominees. I have also endorsed a
plan of more adequate assimilation
to the Honor System. This plan in-
volves a mock honor trial, and a
program of emphasis on unsystem-
atized aspects of honor.

These and other parts of the plat-
form which Steve, Brooks and I
have published are, I think, indica-
tions of our desire steadily to im-
prove W&L in every possible way,
while preserving the _ traditions
which have made us what we are.

These are the things, I think, which
are important to consider in choos-
ing the Student Body officers. To
be sure, there will be some con-
sideration of fraternal and party
loyalties. But in a larger sense,
there will be consideration of what
is best for Washington and Lee, for
its students and its government. It
is because I think that I can serve
the best interest of Washington and
Lee that I seek your support in
this election.

town officers already and have dis-
cussed with them the possibilities
of better relations, which I believe
would be very profitable for both
sides concerned.

The vice presidency is an office
which can be performed, perhaps,
with little time and effort spent, if
the person in office so chooses. If
I am elected I will not rest on the
minimum duties—I will give the
work which is necessary in order for
your student government to function
really well. Of course the only way
by which students can judge wheth-
er my efforts will be sufficient to
be called an improvement in the EC,
is by looking at the record. There-

 

fore, I sincerely ask that each stu-
dent examine the qualifications and
experience in student activities of
both myself and my opponent.

Progressive Party Platform

My ideas on what a good vice
president must do are explained
here, and my qualifications for the
office may be found on our party
posters. A broader statement of
what I stand for may be found in
the Progressive Party Platform,
which I believe to be the strongest
and the most beneficial platform I
have seen in a Washington and Lee
election.

If you support my plans to be an
active vice president, and if on the
basis of my record you determine
that I have the ability and the de-
sire to do a good job, I hope you
will cast your vote for me when
you vote on Thursday.

positions I have had the opportuni-
ty to represent W&L students.

Elective-Appointive Coordination

Equally important as the above,
however, are my basic feelings to-
ward student government. There
should be a definite co-ordination
between the elective and appointive
positions, for instance, the Executive
Committee and the Student Control
Committee so that the basic policy
of this committee could be definitely
understood and implemented. Fur-
thermore, I suggest that through
this co-ordination the Executive
Committee would be brought closer
to the student body in trying to
carry out the E.C. policies and re-
flecting student opinion.

It is with these ideas in mind
that Jim Kulp, Malcolm Morris, and
I have solidly endorsed each pro-
posal in our platform. A vote for
men holding these ideas is a vote
for a stable student government pre-
serving the ideals that we desire
while allowing for adequate reflec-
tion of student opinion.

Brubeck Highlights Springs

Springs Weekend will be high-
lighted by two concerts. The first |
concert tonight features Dave Bru-
beck and his Quartet and the second
tomorrow night features the Chif-
fons, the Crystals and the Five
Royals.

The theme of these two concerts
in Doremus Gymnasium is “Night of
the Satyr.” In keeping with the
theme, the gymnasium atmosphere
will resemble a woodlands festival.
The object of the theme is to pre-
sent a celebration of the diety of
Pan and Bacchus.

Before the Brubeck concert, there
will be a cocktail party sponsored
by the Junior Class at 4:00. This
party behind the Sigma Nu house
will feature Dr. Feelgood and the
Interns. In case of rain the cocktail
party will be held at Moose Lodge.

Making his second appearance at
W&L, Brubeck and his Quartet will
play tonight froom 8 to 10 p.m. in
Doremus Gym

In addition to re;

‘ular albums of

 

standard jazz tunes, there are such
original albums as “Time Out” and
the latest, “Time Changes,” both of
which feature selections from the
usual jazz style. For his outstand-
ing accomplishments, Brubeck has
appeared on the cover of Time.

A typical Brubeck concert is rel-
atively sedate and sophisticated, of-
fering a wide variety of music within
Brubeck’s framework. He offers each
one of the musicians in his quartet
an opportunity to prove his adept-
ness.

The following evening at 8:00 the
Crystals, the Chiffons, and the Five
Royals will perform in Doremus
Gym.

With their recording of He’s So
Fine, the Chiffons burst upon the
national music scene in the winter
1963 with a tremendous explo-
which electrified the entire
record business. The Chiffons con-
tinued their success with their re-
of One Fine Day.

ol
sion

cording

 

They have a unique and instantly

identifiable sound and style. At pres-
ent they have recorded two long-
playing albums, both of which have
equalled the measure of success that
their single recordings did.

The Crystals hit the national rec-
ord scene with their single record-
ings of Do Doo Ron Ron, He’s Sure
the Boy I Love, and Then He Kissed
Me. The Crystals, following in the
style originated by the Shirelles,
have seen a great amount of success
in the popular music field.

The Five Royals appeared on
campus in 1962 when they play-
ed for the school cocktail party
in Red Square. The Royals have
recorded such hits as Think, Please,

Please, Please, and It’s Just What I
Want.
The official part of the Springs

weekend will end with the concert,
but of course the weekend will be
kept going with fraternity combos.

State Sentiment
To Be Polled

Chairmen of the Republican Party
in almost every county and city in
the United States have been asked
by Washington and Lee University’s
Mock Republican Convention lead-
ers which presidential candidates
they will vote for at their national
convention.

Over 3,400 questionnaires and let-
ters were mailed last week to the
Republican leaders in every State
except Texas and Arizona asking
for the number of votes the state’s
delegation will give to each candi-
date.

This nation-wide poll is an un-
precedented move by the Steering
Committee of the Mock Convention
to help the May 4-5 session main-
tain its high record of accurately
predicting who the national con-
vention will nominate.

Faced with the great uncertainty
in this year’s GOP presidential
nomination race, Philip D. Sharp,
Jr., chairman of the Steering Com-
mittee said they decided to go direct-
ly to whom they consider the Re-
publican Party’s opinion makers
with the nation-wide poll.

The poll asks two questions. The
first is: “In your opinion, for which
candidate will your state’s delega-
tion cast its vote on the first ballot?

The names of Goldwater, Lodge
Nixon, Rockefeller, Romney, Scran-
ton, Smith and favorite son are list-
ed after the question.

“If after
Gold-

Scranton—

The second question asks:
the first ballot, the totals are:
water—425; Nixon—200;
200; Rockfeller—150; Lodge—125;
to whom if to anyone, would your
delegates switch? (Again indicate
splits.)”

Again all the major candidates are
listed under this question with a
blank for any other name _ being
considered.

Texas and Arizona Republicans
not being polled because their
states are committed to Goldwater.

Republican leaders in Califor-
nia and Oregon received a different
questionnaire. In California 63
county chairmen and 130 delegates
and alternates to the 1960 Republi-
can National Convention were asked
one question: “Who do think will
win California’s primary on June
2—-Goldwater or Rockefeller?”

In Oregon, 35 county chairmen
and 33 delegates and alternates to
the 1960 Republican Convention
were asked the same question, but
with May 15. substituted the

UP CANDIDATES WIN THREE TOP SPOTS
JIM KULP TO HEAD ‘Go STUDENT BODY

 

 

Morris Wins Largest Margin;
DeYoung, Kreitler Also Win

7 : . :
In yesterday’s student body elections, the University Party

swept the top three positions,

losing only the Fancy Dress

Presidency to the Progressive Patry.

Jim Kulp,

a second-year

law student, defeated Lamar

Lamb, the Progressive Party Candidate, by a clear margin of
279 votes (701-425) to win the position of President of the
*

Student Body.

Jim DeYoung defeated Steve
Smith for the position of Vice-Presi-
dent of the student body. The vote
was 659 for DeYoung and 465 for
Smith.

The largest margin of votes in
the election was shown in the race
for secretary of the student body.
Malcolm Morris soundly defeated
Brooks Brown by a margin of 473
votes (793-320).

The Progressive Party was vic-
torious in the race for President of
Fancy Dress. Dick Kreitler, a Phi
Psi, defeated Patton Adams, Pi
Phi, by a margin of sixteen votes
(571-555).

Voting Brisk

Voting yesterday was brisk. An
exceptionally large turnout high-
lighted the day. Both Parties were
successful in their efforts to get as
many people as possible to vote.

Al Eckes, President of the Univer-
sity Party, expressed his opinions
at the end of the election by say-
ing that he was extremely happy at
the results, and the strength of the
University Party candidates. He
stressed that he did not think that
this election saw the re-birth of
the big-party cliques. Eckes stated
that the University Party will pre-
sent the student body with an equal-
ly strong slate for the class elections
in May.

Jim Kulp

Jim Kulp, following his victory as
Student Body President, stated that
he was very pleased at the outcome
of the elections. He wished to ex-
press his appreciation to those who
aided him in his campaign.

JIM DeYOUNG
Vice President-Elect

Kulp hoped that the split in the

student body would mend and
act as a unit for the betterment
of the school. He also stressed

that he will make every effort to
carry out the platform of the Uni-
versity Party. He is confident of
his success on this matter,

Kulp is presently the intermediate
law class representative to the
Executive Committee. He is a mem-

ber of the Law Review and of Phi
Delta Phi law fraternity. Kulp was
selected as a member of ODK this

year.
Before coming to W&L, Kulp was

for flexibility, in hopes that he will
be able to better implement them.

DeYoung, a Phi Kap, is a Dean's

Postscript

Congratulations to the newly elected
sues and proposals which helped propel you to victory were
refreshingly realistic and sensible.

We might further note, however, and with no hard feelings,
that these last seven days were disappointingly uneventful
compared to previous student body elections. Perhaps this was
partly due to the decided majority of one of the parties. Yet
a significant factor was the apparent race both parties were
running to see who could be the more conservative. In the end,
as luck would have it, it was the party with the slogan “Sta-
bility” that grabbed the laurels. We don’t disparge this fact; we
just wonder how much this conservative sentiment prevails
on other campuses across the nation.

At any rate, we wish president-elect Jim Kulp and his

officers a most successful term,

hoping that the “Stability”? they stand for will be a somewhat
ping 7 y

progressive one.

Letters To The Editor

 

Readers Speak Out On Religion Articles

Editor's Notice: Over the past
several weeks the Friday edition
of the Ring-tum Phi has printed a
series of attacks on Christianity
and the Church entitled “God is
dead.” To help offset the paganism
of the current weekend, however,
we shall interrupt our series to
present several of the sobering let-
ters from our readers. Next week,
we shall publish the concluding
installment which will discuss the
status of the church in the United
States and at the same time will
offer guidelines by which the
church can be led out of its di-
lemma.

Alumnus Disappointed By
Attempt To Debunk Faith

The Editor
Friday Edition
Ring-tum Phi

Dear Sir:

I am disappointed in your attempt
to debunk the Christian faith (ef.
March 20 edition). I am in my first
year in seminary and from what I
have learned so far could do a
much better job of showing where
the New Testament is suspect to
interpolations and bad _ translation.
But this is not a very good cri-
terion on which to judge the worth
of the faith. The big question is
as to whether the Gospel (there is
only one; it is reported in four dif-
ferent accounts) is relevant today.
And what is the Gospel but a state-
ment that God created this world
and that it is good and in the fullness
of time He sent His only Begotten
Son into the world that through
Him man might live. Sure you're
going to say that this is an old-
fashioned way of saying it. Well
perhaps it is but I have read some
of the new ways of saying it and

Lyric And State Praised For Programs;
Hud, Tom Jones, Victors To Appear

By BOB MOTTLEY

Dr, Strangelove was reviewed in
some detail in this corner a few
weeks ago; I will repeat only that
this is one of the finest “comedies”
to appear in many a day; the satire
is devastating and Peter Sellers’
performance as a patsy American
president is enough to make us wish
him a speedy recovery from a re-
cent stroke in California. Yet, be-
hind every guffaw lurks a sincere
Gf brief) prayer that nuclear war

may always seem this funny.

Film habituees in Lexington may
thank Messrs. Daves and Side for
a truly thrilling two months of out-
standing movies: Hud, 8%, and
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers
are expected at the Lyric; from the
State we have in succession after
Strangelove the excellent but con-
troversial Victors, Tom Jones, and
Captain Newman, M.D. And, in ret-
rospect. I hope all who so desired
were able to see Lawrence of Arabia
last week and Fellini’s La Strada,
courtesy of the Journalism Depart-
ment.

The 1964-65 movie season officially
begins (in the United States) after
the annual Oscar presentations. A
rundown on this year’s verdict, for
those who do not know: Best Pic.:
Tom Jones, Outst. Actor: Sidney
Poitier (in Lilies of the Field) Outst.
Actress: Patricia Neal (in Hud);
Best Supp. Actor: Melvyn Douglas

From Shew, I offer the following
preview of films under preparation
for release in 1964:

The two biggest American produc-
tions are to have gala New York
premieres in October: My Fair
Lady (Audrey Hepburn, Rex Harri-
son, directed by George Cukor) and
The Greatest Story Ever Told (Max
Von Sydow, directed by George
Stevens). Other outstanding produc-
tions currently in preparation in-
clude The Sound of Music (Julie
Andrews) and The Sand Pebbles,
both directed by West Side Story’s
Robert Wise; John Huston’s Night
of the Iguana with Burton and Ava

Gardner; Sidney Lumet’s Fail-Safe
(Henry Fonda); Shirley Clarke’s
The Cool World; a very special pro-
duction of Joseph Conrad’s Lord
Jim by Richard Brooks, who directs
Peter O'Toole, James Mason, Eli
Wallach, and Jack Hawkins in the
great sea epic. Billy Wilder, who
produced Irma La Douce, is plan-
ning the Private Life ef Sherlock
Holmes with O’Toole as Holmes and
Peter Sellers as Watson.

On a lower level, the freshest of
the inevitable breed of Rock Hud-

son-Doris Day comedies is soon to;
be released: Send Me No Flowers. |
And, to add the final touch to the)
American scene, Jerry Lewis’ latest
will appear shortly: The Patsy.

Foreign Films

In the U.S.S.\R., Sergei Bondar-
chuk is engrossed in War and Peace,
a mammoth effort soon to result
in four feature-length films. In
Sweden, Ingmar Bergman has finish-
ed a comedy in color, All These Wo-
men, to be issued here in Septem-
ber. In Italy, Fredrico Fellini is
preparing another film starring his
wife Giulietta Masina, this one
called Giulietta of the Spirits—an
original story about magic. Anton-
ioni has completed an unusual tale
of marriage trauma, Red Dessert,
with Monica Vitti and Richard Har-
ris. Lucino Visconti is currently
directing Marcello Mastroianni in a
drama based on The Stranger by

Albert Camus. In France, Serge
Bourguignon, who directed Sun-

days and Cybelle, is working on

 

Not To Give Up Our Dreams, the

story of a jazz musician’s develop-
ment.

In England, Lindsay Anderson
(who directed This Sporting Life) is
filming Richard Harris in Heath-
cliff. The Boulting brothers, who
may be forgiven for Heavens Abovel,
are putting the final licks to some-
thing innocently called Who’s for
Sex? David Lean, director of the
masterful Lawrence of Arabia, is
now preparing Dr. Zhivago from the
novel by Pasternak. Carol Reed is
reworking Irving Stone’s The Agony
and the Ecstacy with Charlton
Heston and Rex Harrison. And last
but not least, the director of Tom
Jones, Anthony Richardson, has two
more possible winners in the fire:
The Charge of the Light Brigade,
and an adaptation of Evelyn Waugh’s
novel about California funeral prac-
tices, The Loved One.

Other films will, of course, be
produced in 1964; however, these
are the ones that are anticipated
with the most relish by the critics.
It looks like it is going to be a
bullish year!

 

Spring Elections, Party Beer Rallies
Prove That Good Times Are Here

By DREW BAUR

The spring elections, with kegs
four nights a week, bring to mind
that good times
are here again. It
seems like a long
time since Fancy
Dress, but Springs
is well worth the
wait.

Except for the
UVa. football
team, the entire
Friday of 63
Springs remains a
rather large blank

   

arm
nt

Baur ; .
in my mind, but
the following day was one which
is worth reviewing.
Since it was a warm, sunny day

most of the campus packed up their

hangovers, dates, aspirin, and Bloody

Mary mix and headed for either
Goshen or Twin Falls as quickly
as possible. Just after noon, most

remembered that there was a combo
in Red Square about two o'clock.

Leaping into their cars, the slyphs

 

 

and nymphs played Stirling Moss
between river and school. By get-
ting back a half hour early, they
had time to resupply themselves
and prepare for the concert that
night. After junking it up all after-
noon either behind the Beta house

or at apartments, everyone put on
a tie and socks to carry the party
to the gymnasium.

The concert could have been
somewhat of a nightmare, however,
it was saved by the mattresses. Be-

cause Springs and SIPA weekend
did not coincide, the mattresses in
the gym were not being used, so
people sitting on the track were
able to get some rack during the
concert. The IBM-like Bo Diddley
and the Andy Capp-like Isley
Brothers put on a good show for

the crowd. From the gym the scene
shifted back to the fraternity houses.
This phase of the evening could be
called the second in a series of wars
between the UVa. footballers and
the Phi Gams. Finally as night fell
on the Stevesville Motel. ...

Only one thought for this year’s
dance Dr. Feelgood and the
Interns should give aid to Dr. Fed-
deman and the Ineps soon
Springs is over.

they just restate it. You can read
Origen, Barth, Tillich, or Bishop
Robinson and all you read is a new
way to say the same ‘thing. And
remember that religion is not some-
thing that we can approach the way
we might some philosophical system.
Religion deals with the very basis
of being. And because of this fact
we can only judge it as we live it.
Or in more popular terms “don’t
knock it till you try it.” And to try
it one must enter it whole heartedly.
And if one does this the question of
relevance of religion ceases to be a
question. And the reason is that the
question itself will become irrele-
vant, and when the question be-
comes irrelevant then it takes a lot
more than Mencken’s article to shake
one’s faith.

Babcock Challenges Lane’s
Justification By Desire’

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi
Dear Sir:

This campus would smell on ice.
The aroma—the attitude of this
student body—is a disgrace to the
traditions of George Washington and
Robert E. Lee. The pseudo-intellec-
tualism here is almost nauseating:
for example, the current sexual rev-
olution is considered beneficient by
most of the persons here. However,
it is interesting to note that those
persons, the “intellectuals,” have
not seen the inside of a church for
years, and yet consider themselves
authorities on morality. It seems
that the Church at Washington and
Lee is becoming farther and farther
removed as an outdated intellectual
cult while the new basis for moral
behavior is the mere rationality of
human desires.

 

I found it highly significant to find
a total of four people at a recent
showing of One Man’s Way, the
story of Norman Vincent Peale. Dr.
Peale is a man who lives and tteach-
es the dynamic doctrine of the
Judeo-Christian theology—that God
is Love, and that with God, all
things are possible. What a contrast
is Dr. Peale’s book, The Power of
Positive Thinking, to Ken Lane’s
article in last week’s Ring-tum Phi
entitled “God Is Dead.” Mr. Lane
justified his article as a means for
the triumph of truth. Is that what it
was, or was it the “Gospel truth,” as
far as this campus is concerned?
WILLIAM R. BABCOCK

Kirkley Reviews Challenge
Faced By Christian Church
To the Editor:

Sir:
I enjoyed your article “God Is
Dead—Part II.” That support of

the Christian Church is declining,
particularly on our college campus-
es, is a fact few would dispute.
The irony of the Easter celebra-
tions—that so many gather together
in so many places for services that
mean so little to so few—was ap-
parent to most of us several Sun-
days ago. For instance, in the Cathe-
dral of St. Philip in Atlanta the
trite, worn-out phraseology of the
Easter message was accompanied by
loud, blatant organ music which
successfully drowned out the pitiful-
ly weak voices of 1600 Episcopalians.
Perhaps the reason why so many
individuals today have ceased to
support the church as a social in-
stitution is this: the church, in
seeking to maintain itself as an
organization, has ceased to grow
and develop from within; in di-
recting its attention to forms, it

 

has forgotten meaning; through

seeking its own ends, it has stop-
ped meeting the individual needs
of the persons, its members.

Because of the crisis faced both
by individuals and by the Church in
today’s mass society, however, I
would disagree with your statement
that, as a vocation open to college
graduates, “the church offers no
challenge comparable to that of
IBM and Wall Street.” Of course,
the life of a minister, just like the
life of a college professor or a busi-

_|Mmess man, can be an escape from

the existential problem of being hu-
man in society with other men.

But precisely because the stresses
of modern life place such a burden
upon individuals and upon the
Church, which must maintain its in-
tegrity as a functioning organiza-
tion without sacrificing its direct ap-
peal to and concern for each per-
son, the challenge and opportunity
of the ministry as a form through
which one can create meaning in
life is exceptionally great.

Further, though I cannot make a
statement regarding seminaries in
general, I have recently spent about
a week at Virginia Theological Sem-
inary in Alexandria and feel that
this small group of persons, both as
scholars and as men, are attempting
to make the gospel relevant to life
today. I talked with ‘bishops, minis-
ters, professors, and students who
live and work with the businessmen,
the politicians, the laborers, and the
poor in and around the nation’s
capital. These men are aware of
today’s problems in all walks of
life and are acting with intelligence
and purpose to meet these problems
effectively.

The challenge is apparent. There
should be a greater response.

Sincerely,
JOHN KIRKLEY

To Play RPI

 

Heumann Pitches

Team

to Victory

Washington and Lee’s baseball team gained its first cut-
legiate victory of the season at Lynchburg College Wednesday.
Pete Heumann, sophomore righthander, pitched the Gen-
erals to the 9-7 victory. He had relieved starter Chris Wigert

in the fourth inning.

The win gave W&L a 1-4-1 record against collegiate com-
*

pecition, 2-7-1 oveeall.

The Generals weored their nine
runs on nine hits and_ three
Lynchburg errors. W&L made four
errors, while the Hornets got 11
hits.

Green Catches

Kenny Green tovk over as catcher
for the Generals, Tom Crenshaw
switching to left field. Green got
two hits and, according to coach Joe
Lyles, “caught a fine game.”

Lyles attributed the victory to the
fact that the team had finally gotten
the big hitting.

The Generals met Richmond Pro-
fessional Institute in Richmond this
afternoon. RPI, under coach Ed
Allen, had only lost one game this
year. W&l won two games from
RPI last season.

W&L had, until beating Lynch-
burg, lacked hitting. The team had
averaged only three runs a game
in collegiate competition. The Gen-
erals had twice been shut out and
three times held to one run.

Fort Bragg Next
Two of these one-run games were
against Fort Bragg, who meets the
Generals here Tuesday. Fort Bragg

defeated W&L 7-6, 14-1 and 9-1 on},

the spring trip.

Several of the Fort Bragg ball-
players are former major leaguers.
Left fielder Bill Baker played with
Cincinnati, shortstop Dick Schmidt
with Los Angeles.

W&L has four more regularly
scheduled games and a_ postponed
game with RPI before the
tournament beginning May 8
Danville, Ky.

A tough ZBT volleyball team
swept through the playoffs in that
sport to take the championship and
move into third place in the I-M
standings for all sports.

ZBT took the title after whip-
ping Phi Kappa Sig, Delt, and
DU. DU, losing only to ZBT, came
on strong to repeat in the runner-
up spot. Delt managed to chip five
points away from the Phi Kappa
Sig all I-M lead by downing the
Phi Kap’s in the volleyball play-
offs and taking third place. Phi
Kap finished fourth.

With the inclusion of the volley-
ball standings, Phi Kappa Sig still
leads the I-M standings with 1528
points. Defending champ Delt fol-
lows in second place with 1365. ZBT,
previously tied for third, has moved
ahead of SAE with 1313 points.

The I-M softball season opened
this week, with defending champion
Delt rating as the team to beat.
The Delts opened the season by giv-
ing Phi Psi a 12-2 pasting.

On the whole, it was a pretty
poor week for pitchers, with 120
runs scored in the five games play-
ed.

SPE scored 20 of the runs when
they whipped Beta, 20-12, but
Sigma Nu took the week's record
when they piled up 23 runs in
defeating Lambda Chi 23-13. In a
game that went eight innings in-
stead of the regulation softball
seven, DU whipped Pi Phi, 17-14
in spite of Howard Busse’s five
for five performance.

In the league’s only pitcher’s duel,
Law displayed its customary good
pitching in edging Phi Gam 4-3. In
other games PiKA won by forfeit
over NFU, and PEP won by for-
feit over KA,

Soccer Meet Draws 32

Thirty-two men, including 12 let-
termen, turned out for a _ soccer
meeting Tuesday night.

The soccer team begins spring
practice May 11. Coach Joe Lyles
said he hopes to stage an alumni-
varsity game May 16.

Last season the soccer team com-
piled a 6-3 record. Only four letter-
men have been lost from that team.
The freshmen won five of eight
games.

Freshmen Beat AMA 7-2;
Varsity Preps for Villanova

While the varsity lacrosse team was running through its
last full scale practice yesterday in preparation for tomorrow’s
game against Villanova, the W&L freshmen defeated Augusta
Military 7-2.

The freshmen, led by crease attackman Scott Tappan’s
four goals, were in control of the game from the opening face-
off. Fred Skinner took the ball on the face-off and fed to Tap-

pan for the score in the first five seconds of the game.

Tennis Team Meets Lynchburg

For the second time the tennis
team’s match with Hampden-Sydney
has been rained out. This time the
match was scheduled for Tuesday.

This afternoon the team met
Lynchburg here, minus, just as it
was for most of the spring trip, its
top two men. Jim DeYoung is out

 

Duckwall’s 79 Sets Pace
As Golfers Beat Lynchburg

The Washington and Lee Golf team
defeated Hampden-Sydney 6'2-2'2
yesterday afternoon. The victory up-
ped the Generals record to 2-0.

Bob Duckwall took medalist hon-

ors, shooting a 79 over Lynch-
burg’s Boonsboro Country Club
course.

W&L was to have met Roanoke
College Tuesday, but rain postponed
the match. It has been rescheduled
for Wednesday.

Last year the Generals won four
matches and tied one. Coach E. P.
“Cy” Twombly said he hopes this
year’s team can better that mark.

This afternoon the golfers met
Virginia in Hot Springs. Virginia,
defender of the state intercollegiate
title, defeated W&L 17-10 last year,
on a nine points per foursome
basis.

Ralph Callahan and John Verity
led the strong Cavalier team, which
beat VMI and VPI in a triangular
match last week.

The Generals meet Old Dominion
in Norfolk Monday.

*Hopkins, two goals, and Bryant
Kendrick, one goal.

The Generals completely domi-
nated play in the first half, scoring
all their goals before the halftime
break. Even crease defenseman Dave
Shufflebarger got into the act, and
picked up an assist with a feed to
Tappan.

Both Augusta goals came iate in
the fourth quarter after W&L goalie
Skip Brooks had left the field.

Villanova Tomorrow

Tomorrow at 2:30 p.m. on Wilson
Field W&L will meet a Villanova
team plagued by injuries thus far
this season.

Villanova has lost its last two
games, to Georgetown 10-9, and to
New York Maritime, 8-4. Also hav-
ing lost to C. W. Post and Ohio
State, Villanova has a 0-4 season
record.

This year’s Villanova team is vir-
tually the same team that compiled
a 6-5 record last year. Coach Bob
McHenry said that if the Pennsyl-
vanians report in good physical con-
dition, the Generals could have a
tough game on their hands.

Plays Zone

Villanova, like Swarthmore and
North Carolina, whom the Generals
play next, will run a zone defense.
W&L has not been impressive
against the zone this year, but Mc-
Henry feels the Swarthmore exper-
ience will stand the team in good

with a side injury; John Baker was
singing at a wedding.

Earlier, Lynchburg had _ been
beaten by Randolph-Macon, a team
that the Generals defeated 6-3.

The freshman team was also rained
out Tuesday. Their match, against
Staunton Military, has been re-
scheduled to April 29.

Randy Jones played number one
this afternoon for W&L. Jones won
five of six matches in that position

on the spring trip. stead.

Gasque, Kell
Lead W&L
To Win

Freshman Gay Gasque broke the
school record in the shot put for
the second time in three weeks,
winning the discus also, and Rob-
in Kell captured the triple jump
and the high jump to lead the Gen-
eral track team to an 87-58 victory
over Bridgewater College Tuesday
on the W&L track.

Gasque’s heave of 47’ 6” broke
his own school record of 46’ 4”
which he had set against Old Do-
minion. Saturday he had set a new
freshman record in the Colonial
Relay meet in Williamsburg with a
throw of 45’ 11”. He also won the
discus Tuesday with a 126 7” ef-
fort.

Kell continued his unbeaten record
in the triple jump as he leaped
41’ 8%” to win the event. He also
won the high jump at 5’ 8”.

The win pushes the thin clads’
dual meet record to 2-1. Bridgewater
is now 1-1.

W&L Sweeps Three

The Generals combined individual
effort with team depth to defeat
the visitors. W&l won 10 of the
17 events, sweeping three.

Two of the sweeps were in field
events, all of which, with the ex-
ception of the broad jump, were
captured by W&L. George Vogel
led the way in the javelin, winning
it with a 152’ 3” toss. Johnny Gra-
ham led the sweep in the pole vault
with a winning height of 11’ 6”.

Chris Kell headed the General
sweep of the 100-yard dash, clock-
ing 10.6.

Essex Wins Easily

Co-captain Skip Essex had an
easy go of it, winning the quarter
mile in 52.7, and Jim Thompson
took the 880 in 2:03.1. The Generals
won the 440 relay with a 445
clocking, but lost the mile relay
even though an unofficial team de-
feated the Bridgewater squad.

This afternoon, the harriers travel
to Roanoke College. This promises
to be one of the season’s tougher
meets. Coach Norm Lord pointed
out that W&L has not defeated Roa-
noke since he has been coaching
here.

 

Happy
Birthday

Mr. K

 

 

The score was 3-2, in the ninth.

And that’s the way it stayed as
the New York Yankees were beaten
by their own farm team, the Rich-
mond Virginians.

How did the Yankees look against
the Vees last weekend? Miserable.
The Vees, who finished near the
bottom last year in the International
League, not only beat the Yankees
32, but also played a better brand
of ball.

To watch them play, you’d never
know that the Yankees are the
odds-on favorites to win another
pennant. Only one word can de-
scribe their performance—sick.
The Virginians, about as short on

power as a rundown battery, used
their speed to score the surprising
victory in the Richmond exhibition
game.

They poured on the steam to score
off two weak hits in the sixth
inning off Ralph Terry. Then, in
the eighth, pinch-hitter Ike Futch
knocked a single to center field,
stole second base and scored the
winning run on a hard ground single
to right by Horace Clark.

The extra speed almost got the
Vees another run when Clarke came
all the way from first on a fly ball
double by Art Lopez, but a perfect
relay just barely got Clarke at
home.

"After scoring on the Vees twice
in six innings, the Yankees took
out Mantle and Maris. It would
appear the Yankees thought they
had the game in the bag.

Yankee pitcher Ralph Terry put
on a memorable performance by
falling on his tail when he tried to
catch a pop-up.

The Yankees admitted after the
game that the Vee’s superior speed
had made the difference. Even
rookie manager Yogi Berra was im-
pressed—‘“It looks like we sent our
speed team to Richmond. I like that
speed. There’s no substitute for it.”

Mantle, who watched the last
three innings in the stands among
autograph hunters, admitted that
one of his greatest assets, his speed,
is gone.

“I know I can’t run with a lot
of them anymore,” said Mantle, who
is nearing 33 and underwent knee
surgery during the winter.

“‘Tve been thrown out on three
balls by the shortstop this year.
I'd hit to deep short and they'd
get me. Hell, they used to keep
the ball when I hit there. They
didn’t even look toward first.

“When I first came up I never
saw anyone who could outrun me.
Now, most of them can.”

vention of Omieron Delta Kappa,
honorary leadership society.

Approximately 200 delegates from
110 circles of the society will at-
tend the gold anniversary meeting
in Roanoke and Lexington, April
23 to 20.

Rusk To Give Speech

Secretary of State Dean Rusk,
who was tapped for membership in
ODK as an undergraduate at David-
son College, will give the major ad-
dress at the convention’s opening
convocation Thursday evening, April
23, at Hotel Roanoke.

Friday, April 24, the convenition
will make an all day pilgrimage to
Washington and Lee, where ODK
was founded in 1914.

Washington and Lee University
President Fred C. Cole will address
a convention luncheon that day in
Evans Dining Hall.

A model initiation service and a
recognition of the founders of the
society will follow in Lee Chapel
on Washington and Lee’s campus.

president of the University of Vir-
ginia.

morning with the report of commit-
tees, legislative action and the elec-
tion and installation of new officers.

Noell, Eckes
Get Fulbrights

The Fulbright-Hays Scholarship
Committee announced this week the
names of two Washington and Lee
students as scholarship winners.
Seniors William A. Noell of Blue-
field, West Virginia and Alfred E.
Eckes of Admore, Pennsylvania
were the two students named by the
committee.

The grants are made under

 

the

provisions of the Mutual Education- |

al and Cultural Exchange Act of
1961. Candidates are selected by the

Board of Foreign Scholarships which
is appointed by the President. All
candidates that appear before the
national committee have been rec-
ommended by campus Fulbright-
Hays committees.

Noell, retiring President of the
Student Body, will do his study at
the University of Frankfort in
Frankfort, Germany. His main field
of study will be research into the
policy of co-determination. Under
this policy the workers in factories
sit in on management meetings and
help determine factory policy. Most
of Noell’s study will be with the
steel industry in Germany, where
the policy of co-determination has
been especially prevalent. He will
try to determine if the policy has
been successful, and if so, whether
it could be transplanted to other
countries.

Eckes will be doing graduate study
in eeonomics at Christ’s College,
Cambridge. He plans to work spe-
cifically with preferential trading

Sibal, Osmers Accept Invitations

 

Two Speakers Named By Sharp

Phil Sharp, chairman of the Mock
Convention, has announced that the
convention’s traditional evening ad-
dress on May 4 will be divided be-
tween two U.S. Congressmen, The
Hon. Abner Sibal (R-Conn.) and
The Hon. Frank Osmers (R-N.J.).

The pair will highlight the eve-
ning session of the convention's
opening day, following the keynote
address by Dr. Walter Judd. Os-
mers and Sibal bring the number of
congressmen who will attend the
Mock Convention to three, The Hon.
Richard Poff of Roanoke having

accepted an invitation earlier this
year.

Sharp described beth Sibal and
Osmers as moderates in their po-
litical thinking. He pointed out
that their presence at the Mock
Convention will balance a number
of political conservatives who plan
to attend. The conservatives who
will be at the convention already
include strong Goldwater backers
such as National Republican
Chairman “Buz” Lukens and Ala-
bama Republican Chairman John
Grenier.

 

 

Communist Domination By 1967
Forseen By Professor McCrossen

By HOWARD EPSTEIN

Speaking in Lee Chapel last night,
Dr. Vincent A. McCrossen, Professor
of Languages and Literature at
Boston College, warned that because
Communism was expanding at the
rate of 4.6 per cent a year, this
country would be Communist by
January 15, 1966.

However, the Professor’s store of
knowledge did not end there. He
pointed out that, although the Com-
munists may compose only a small
minority of the country, they will
prevail due to the support of other
groups that hold similar beliefs—
liberals and other paralled groups.

Communist Behind Racial Crisis

Dr. McCrossen viewed the pres-
ent racial crisis as a Communist-led
plot to create frustration and law-
lessness among the people He show-
ed how this provided little aid for
the Negroes, much propaganda for
the Communists, and is supported
by all American Communist lead-
ers.

He exposed the Civil Rights Bill
as a serious threat to the freedom
of the individual, especially in that
it places the property, job, means
of life, and other rights of the indi-
vidual in the hands of a small bu-
reaucratic group led by the Attor-
ney General.

 

Notice

Tonight at 8:00 (duPont Auditor-

ium) ReVue will present Mr. Joe
Sun Hawk, an American Indian
philosopher and  extemperaneous

poet. The elderly former head of the
American Church, an Indian relig-
ious organization of the Southwest
(famed for its use of peyote), will
speak on “Sunrise—a View from the
Indian Side.”

Sun Hawk, dressed in his tribal
garments, will appear in Lexing-
ton while en route from his home
at the Taos Pueblo in Albuquerque,
New Mexico, to New York where he
plans to attend the opening of the
World’s Fair
evening to
University.

ReVUE at New York

and lecture Thursday

Instead of employing government
force, MecCrossen proposed a meth-
od of eradicating discrimination
through a personal and religious
medium. In this way the Communists
would not be aided, the same goal
would be achieved, and the dem-
ocratic traditions of our country
would be maintained.

In closing, the speaker exhibited
how the Communists could be a
stooge for another international con-

Dr. Vincent ‘ -McCrossen

spiracy that is “using” them just
as the Communists are using other
organizations for Red purposes. Dr.
MecCrossen was unable to name such
a group but listed possible examples
of such a group—international bank-
ers or Zionists.

In the question period following
his lecture, the Professor diagramed
the American political spectrum
which was highlighted by his label-
ing Nelson Rockefeller and Henry
Cabot Lodge “Stooges” of the
Communists and Barry Goldwater
and William Buckley “Moder-
ates.” The only rightists were anar-
chists and maybe followers of Ann
Rand.

Sibal In Second Term

Representative Sibal served as
Prosecuting Attorney and Corpora-
tion Counsel for the City of Nor-
walk, Connecticut, before being
elected to the State Senate in 1957.
He became Minority Leader in the
Connecticut Senate, and was Chair-
man of the Connecticut Commission
on the Revision of Corporation Law.
He was elected to the 87th Congress
from his state’s Fourth District, and
was re-elected to the 88th Congress.
He is a member of the House Inter-
state and Foreign Commerce Com-
mittee, and is Connecticut’s repre-
sentative to the Republican Con-
gressional Campaign Committee.

Representative Osmers served in
succession as councilman and mayor
of his home city of Haworth, New
Jersey, and as a state assemblyman.
Elected to the 76th and 77th Con-
gresses, he left Congress the day
World War II was declared to en-
list as a private. He was discharged
from active duty as a major.

Mr. Osmers won a special election
to an unexpired term in the 82nd
Congress, and has since been re-
elected to the 83rd, 84th, 87th, and
88th Congresses. He represents the
Ninth District of New Jersey in the
House.

 

Concert Series

Closes Apr. 23

The Richmond Symphony Orches-
tra, with members of 'the Richmond
Woodwind Quintet as guest soloists,
will present the final concert of the
Rockbridge Concert-Theater Series
season at 8:15 p.m. Thursday, April
23. The concert will take place in
the Washington and Lee Gymnasium
instead of at VMI as previously an-
nounced.

John O’Brannon,
Thayer, French horn;
er, Clarinet:

oboe; Edwin
Robert Bark-
and Richard Manson,
basson, will be featured players in
the Sinfonie Concertante in E-flat
Major by Mozart. Other works on
the Richmond Symphony’s _ initial
Lexington appearance will be Ros-
sinni’s Overture to the Barber of
Seville and Tchaikovsky’s “Pathe-
tique” Symphony.

The Mozart Sinfonie is described
by Alfred Einstein as a work lying
somewhere between a symphony in
which four wind instruments have
prominent solo passages and a con-
certo for four solo wind instruments
with orchestra accompaniment. Mo-
zart wrote the work in Paris in 1778
and sold it to a promoter of concerts.
For some reason the scheduled per-
formance was cancelled and Mozart
did not retrieve his score. He stated
his intention of re-writing it from
memory and may have done so. The
text now being used was discovered
in the 1860’s, and there is no way
of telling whether it was the original
seore or a re-written version.

Handley: Colvin
Grab Leads

In ‘Androcles’

The Troubadour Theatre announc-
es that the cast has been selected
for the third production of the
year, Androcles and the Lion. The
play, a comedy by George Bernard
Shaw, contains a large cast of nine-
teen men and five women.

In the title role of Androcles is
Lockhardt Handley. Handley was
seen last in two low comic roles in
Dr. Faustus. As Androcles, Handley
portrays the hen-pecked, animal-
loving Christian whose meekness
awards him salvation from the jaws
of the Emperor’s lion.

Morton Plays the Lion

The Lion is played by Tim Morton
who doubles in the role of Spintho,
a debauched Christian prisoner
whose only hope for salvation is to
suffer martyrdom in the arena.

As ‘the Lion, Morton is both fe-
rocious and friendly, depending upon
his appetite. Morton portrayed Faus-
tus in the Trowbs’ last production.

Representing pomp and severity of
Roman justice is the Captain, played
by Steve Colvin who also appeared
in Faustus. Colvin plays the part of
a befuddled officer of the Emperor
who struggles, despite obvious dif-
ferences in beliefs, to save another
Patrician, a female Christian pris-
oner, Lavinia.

Reading To Portray Caesar

In the role of the erratic and
quixotic Caesar is Gay Reading. As
Emperor, Reading has to mingle his
affairs of state with a personal con-
frontation with his own lion who
is all too eager to devour him. Con-
trasted to the Emperor is Ferrovius,
played by Joe Volpe. Volpe is seen
as a Christian prisoner who is a bit
of a brute aside from being force-
fully persuasive when it comes to
converting the likes of Lentulus,
played by Lew Davis.

Filling important women’s roles
are two newcomers to the Troub-
abour stage, Mrs. Jane Rushing
and Mrs. Mary Ann Gilda. Mrs.
Rushing, wife of Robert Rushing,
Visiting Associate Professor of Law,
characterizes Megaera, Andro-
cles’ domineering non-Christian
wife. Mrs. Gilda, wife of John Gilda,
a law senior, portrays Lavinia, a
Christian martyr with the wit of
Shaw and the breeding of a Patri-
cian.

Featured Comic Roles

Other featured comic roles be-
long to Mare Rehr, the boisterous
and incredulous Centurion, and to
Charlie Bright, the Emperor’s pom-
pous Editor. Both are forced to deal
with the jubilant Christians who
refuse to act like martyrs. Stark
Sydnor plays two roles: The Imper-
ial Ox-cart Driver and the brawny
Gladiator, Secutor, who tangles with
Retiarius, another gladiator played
by Lexington High School senior
Bill Gaines. Mike Nation plays Me-
tellus, another of the Emperer’s fav-
orites.

Also featured in _ this
hearted farce is Jake Duvall,
son of Dr. Severn Duvall, head of
the English Department. At 11%,
Jake is clearly the youngest in this
cast of 24, yet he maintains a
speaking part as Call Boy for the
events in the arena.

In the roles of bedraggled soldiers
and gladiators are Guy

One Editorship Undecided

The Publications Board was un-
able to decide on a second candidate
for the editorship of The Ring-tum
Phi. A meeting will be called in
the near future by the board pres-
ident Syd Butler to attempt to reach
a satisfactory conclusion.

Smith has worked with The Ring-
tum Phi since his freshman year,
serving progressively as Associate
Editor, News Editor, and Managing
Editor. He has worked this year
as Publicity Director for the Mock
Convention, and served as the Presi-
dent of this year’s Spring Dances.

In addition to maintaining Dean’s
List and Honor Roll grades, Simth
is a Dorm Counselor, a member of
ODK, and a member of Tau Kappa
Alpha, honorary debate fraternity.

Smith’s Editorial Plan

Smith says his program next yeai
will be to present an interpretation
of news events through an objective
editorial policy.

Carrell has worked on the busi-
ness side of the newspaper since his
freshman year, serving this past year
as Subscription Manager. He has
been elected president of the Liber-
ty Hall Society this spring.

Baur, besides writing a humor
column this year for the Friday
Edition, serves on the Cold Check
Committee and plays Varsity Tennis.
He has worked for the Troubadour
Theatre, is an officer in his frater-
nity, and a member of the Mongo-
lian Minks.

DeYoung, recently elected vice
president of the student body, has
been president of his fraternity, is
a member of ODK, and plays var-
sity tennis.

TUM PHI

 

*

Governor William W. Scranton of Pennsylvania receives
the full endorsement of the Tuesday Edition of the Ring-tum
Phi as the most qualified man for the 1964 Republican Nomi-
tion. While Scranton has spent less time in public office than
any other potential nominee, he has done more, relatively
speaking, than any of them to prove his fitness for the office of

 

Tuesday

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

Edition

 

President of the United States. Our decision to support Gover-
nor Scranton is based on our conviction that he is the best man
to unite the GOP in the 1964 campaign, and that his capability
has been proved by his record as Governor.

Scranton’s Accomplishments in Pennsylvania

In only two years as Governor, Scranton has put new life
into a state which was in sorry shape economically when he
took office. The record:

% When Scranton took office in 1962, Pennsylvania un-
employment was 9.4 per cent—one of the highest in the na-
tion. At the end of 1963, it was down to 6.7 percent, and
56,000 people had been taken off relief.

* During 1963, 350 new industries moved into Pennsyl-
vania, and 350 more announced expansion plans. Bank de-
posits increased by two billion dollars.

% Since 1962, 2,500 new classrooms have been comple-
ted and a record $70 billion has been committed for public and
private colleges. There has been a substantial, across-the-board
hike in teachers’ salaries.

% Ninety per cent of Scranton’s program has been passed
through a legislature which has a tiny Republican majority.

% Scranton has eliminated more than 2,500 unnecessary
jobs in Pennsylvania’s spoils system.

We could go on—his record as Governor is unblemished,
and promises to stay that way. He has followed through on
every promise he made in his campaign for governor.

Scranton Behind States’ Rights

Scranton believes government must be kept close to the
people, and is a firm advocate of letting state governments
sponsor programs for housing, urban redevelopment, educa-
tion, and employment. He feels that the state governments—
if they will take the responsibility—can do a much better job
in these fields than the national government. To help them
do their job, he suggests that the federal government turn
over $16 billion in excise taxes to the states.

Views on Foreign Affairs

Scranton believes in brinkmanship. He advocates a strong
stand against the Communists, even where there is obvious
danger involved. The only thing the Communists understand
is strength, in Scranton’s view, and he believes the United
States has enough strength to force Russia to back down as
they have in Greece, Lebanon, Cuba, Korea, Quemoy and
Matsu.

Cuba must be acted upon—there are various types of
blockades, depending on what intelligence reports show. The
United States cannot afford to sit on its hands while Cuba con-
tinues to be a center for Communist subversion in Latin

America.

liberalizing the operating rules of the Kerr-Mills Act. Scran-
ton is outspoken in his support of civil rights. He approves
the objectives of every title of the civil rights bill now before
Congress.

Record as Campaigner

One of the most impressive things about Scranton is his
campaign personality—it is sincere, cool under pressure, and
vigorous. Were Scranton to run against Johnson for the presi-
dency, the contest between the two men would be marked—
all in favor of Scranton. He “has been tugged reluctantly into
every public job he has ever held,” yet once he has been
assured of party support, he has won by impressive majorities.

In 1960, he ran for Congress from Pennsylvania’s 10th
District. There were 34,000 more registered Democrats than
registered Republicans in that district when Scranton started
his campaign. In the year that Kennedy swept Pennsylvania,
and its 10th District by 15,000 votes, Scranton won by
17,000 votes. In 1962, he won his bid for the governorship
by 486,000 votes.

Scranton enjoys street-corner politicking. His mind is quick
and analytical. Before he ran for Congress in 1960, he worked
in the State Department under John Foster Dulles and Chris-
tian Herter. Herter’s appraisal: “I have never seen anyone
grasp with greater rapidity not only the factual details but the
implications in the many knotty problems which come to this
office.”

While a Congressman, Scranton ignored the tradition that
a freshman Congressman should be seen and not heard. He
offered major amendments to Kennedy’s 1961 housing bill and
his 1962 public-works bills. Both his amendments were adopt-
ed. In each case, his amendments reduced the amount of
money a local community would have to pay as a share of
federal projects.

Personal History

Scranton went to Hotchkiss for prep school, Yale for his
B.A., majoring in history there. During World War II, he
served as an Air Transport Command pilot. In 1946, he re-
ceived a law degree from Yale. He is now 47 years old,
and is worth about eight million dollars because of inheritances
from his parents. He is a devoted family man, who believes that
he should refuse to run for any public office unless he has his
political party completely behind him. That is why he insists
on having a genuine draft from the Republican convention
before he will accept the nomination.

A political realist, Scranton knows that the 1964 presi-
dential race will be impossible to win unless the candidate is
promised the full support of every branch of his party. He
insisted upon it before he ran for governor in Pennsylvania,
and all 67 of the usually squabbling county chairmen immedi-
ately gave him their support.

balanced budget to Pennsylvania at the beginning of this year
with a 25-million-dollar operating surplus in the legislature.
He does not favor Medicare, because “it covers too many peo-
ple who don’t need help and fails to cover many who do.”

 

In Pennsylvania, he has helped the medical problem by greatly

MacArthur’
That Will Not Be Forgotten

By GARETH S. ADEN
There is something about the death
of a great soldier that plays on the
imagination. To be sure there was
something about
y the slow proces-
i sion that made its
way through the
wet streets of our
F nation’s capital a
littlemore than a
week ago that
stirred the mem-
ories of millions
of Americans. Mo-
mentarily they
forgot Bobby Bak-
er, nomination
campaigns, and all else. MacArthur
was dead.

It has been said that it is most
difficult for college students of to-
day to sense the significance of
MacArthur’s life or the loss of his
death. To a great extent this must
be true. It would take someone, an
American, who could recall the
fall of Corregidor or the ensuing
dark days in the Pacific to truly
appreciate the strength and con-
fidence associated with the name
“MacArthur.” Only to those who
were vitally concerned at the time
can the words, “I will return”
truly have meaning. We who come
after can only seek to know the
life and the man to whom our
country pays so great tribute.

 

Above all else General Douglas
MacArthur was a soldier. It is as a
soldier that he would want to be
remembered. His whole life reflects
the military code which he esteemed
above all other codes. And he was
no ordinary soldier as he proved
time and again over the course of
two world wars. As a leader he was
both bold and responsible at the

 

- The Legend

same time. He had learned the ab-
solute value of victory and had the

technical and strategical knowledge

to bring off superior campaigns.

His talents were especially adaptable | |
to the island fighting of the South] :

Pacific, where his “leap-frog” strat-
egy proved vital to the Allies.

Among MacArthur's various tal-
ents, was his ability for adminis-
tration. He made the Allied occu-
pation of Japan a success and
actually agreeable to the people of
that country. Wherever he worked
as a leader, he ingratiated himself
with the people there, and built
himself a legend at home .To the
people of the occupation abroad,
he was an able and personable
leader; to Americans at home, he
was the one general in the Pa-
cifie who could win.

MacArthur will be remembered as
a man of great conviction. He be-
came an image of strength and con-
fidence. Although many Americans,
including the President, disagreed
with his views on policy and ex-

pedience; none of them could ques- |

erey P ' audience’s

make him change his mind. Be-
cause of his views, he was relieved
of his command, but the hysterical
welcome he received upon returning
to the United States spoke clearly
enough for the peoples’ admiration

As has been the case with so many
great military men, MacArthur had a
gift for rhetoric. In a sentence he
could catch the tragedy or the vic-
tory of the most complicated situa-
tion. His words were the type that
appealed to men’s imaginations. The
following lines concern the Ameri-
can soldiers who died in World War
I, and are among his most famous:

I have seen “Dr. Strangelove: Or
How I Learned To Stop Worrying
and Love the Bomb” five times;
I have reacted differently each time;
and I believe I can say it is the best
American movie I have ever seen.
I almost hesitate to say so, be-
cause of my varied reactions, but
I have attempted to compare it
with the good films that have come
before, and that is my conclusion.
The film is not without flaws. Some
of the dialogue should have been
omitted (for example, when Sterling
Hayden closes one scene with “The
redcoats are coming.”); some lines
are delivered poorly; and sometimes
the director loses control of his ac-
tors. Yet if any movie may be called
great, this one may.

Controlled Audience Response

I believe Stanley Kubrick’s great-
est talent is his ability to control the
emotional responses, to
accentuate the comedy and the ser-
iousness in order to make his point
as telling as possible. Before review-
ing the film in detail, I would like
to say something about the titles,
While the credits are given at the
beginning, we are treated to the
sight of two airplanes engaged in
the sex act. You have to laugh be-
cause it is funny; but it is also the
most obscene sequence I have seen
in a film. Without a point it would
be tasteless. Yet it has an important
one; the mere fact that we ean
recognize it as two magnificent and
very modern machines making love.
Has it come to that? Indeed it has,

 

(Continued on page 4)

and indeed this is the strangest love

  
  
 
 

 

imaginable. Kubrick questions, with
the answer implied, the social and
moral “progress” of man.

Mixture of Comedy

The film is divided into eighteen
sequences. The first is at Burpelson
Air Force Base, where, on his own
authority, General Jack D. Ripper
orders an attack on Russia. The
scene is amusing because of the
slightly exaggerated character of
Ripper, played with admirable re-
straint by Sterling Hayden. But it
is also deeply serious; the signifi-
cance of the attack and the recog-
nition of Ripper as a psychotic make
one hesitate to laugh.

The second is at the airplane com-
manded by Major King Kong. This
scene is funnier than the first be-
cause of its dialogue and because
of Kong’s personality and character.
Kubrick makes fun of the serious-
ness of the coming attack.

The third sequence is the bedroom
of General Buck Turgidson, Chief
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. This
scene is hilarious all the way
through, both because of the situa-
tion and because of Turgidson’s
character, played by George C. Scott.
Turgidson is no psychotic; he is
merely a simple-minded egoist, so
concerned with his role in life, that
it never occurs to him that it is a
role. You are expected to laugh at
him from beginning to end.

Thus Kubrick seems to have built
slowly and begun a riotous comedy;
the seriousness has slipped away.
But it doesn’t. Kubrick switches us
back to Ripper. He again handles

Kubrick goes on in later scences to
present the incredible absurdity of
the situation and the characters. At
these scenes we must laugh. In
other scenes, however, he maintains
a rigorous development of suspense,
as if no comedy had come before
it. Let me examine one of these
carefully in order to point out just
how Kubrick is able to control us.

When Major Kong’s plane has
entered Russian territory, a missile
is fired at it. Kubrick builds the
suspense in this way—by switching
from a shot of the radar machine
showing how far away the missile
is, to the pilot, outside to a shot of
the plane trying to evade the missile,
back to the radar machine, back to
the pilot, and so on until the missile
explodes. All this time we sit, afraid
for the plane and for our boys,
wondering if they will escape the
missile. Finally when they do, we
are relieved. And then it suddenly
occurs to us that because our plane
and our boys have escaped destruc-
tion, for a while the world is going
to be destroyed. We have been put
in a position where we have cheered
for the worng side. I can think of
no better example of Kubrick’s
genius.

Immaturity
Charged In
Campaign

By ROD COCKSHUTT

The Student Body elections are
over. Whether the candidates who
_ won are or will
be the “best men”
is something we
won't really know
until next year
_ at this time. Cer-
tainly the officers-
elect deserve, and
will need, the sup-
port and cooper-
» ation of the entire
student body at
Cockshutt Washington and
Lee if the princi-
ple of student government is ever

to work effectively here.

But let us turn our attention to
the campaign just passed. It was,
it seems to me, on both sides, the
most immature, the most super-
ficial, and certainly the dullest
campaign which has taken place
on this campus in the four years
I've been here.

That a fraternity should bolt a
party because one of its men is
not nominated, or because the par-
ty’s candidates do not appeal to cer-
tain elements in a particular house,
smacks of immaturity. Politics is no
place for people who pick up their
marbles and go home, or go else-
where when the game isn’t played
their way. This is where the cam-
pus politics “pros” of last year show-
ed this year how “professional” they
really are.

And where were the issues of the
campaign? The platforms that both
parties claimed to stand on were
filled with vagaries, generalities, and
trivialities that seemed aimed more

Lacrosse Team Smashes Villanova, 21-1

W&L Trackaten

Trackmen Advance Record
In Roanoke College Victory

By LARRY CRAIG
Tuesday Sports Writer

The W

/ashington and Lee trackmen advanced their season’s

record to 3-1 with their victory Saturday over a good Roanoke

College team, 83-57.

The Generals were led by triple-winner Chris Kell who
won the 100, 220 and anchored the winning 440-yard relay

team. Brother Robin Kell also
jump,
step and jump, and finishing third
in the broad jump.

A pleasant surprise came when
sophomore Rick Myttinen threw
the javelin 182 feet, three inches.
This was far his best effort and the
best for W&L in the last few years
although the toss got him only a
second place.

Other results were John Graham
who placed first in the pole vault
with an 11 foot, 6 inch jump; Gay
Gasque who won the shot and
placed second in the discus while
Head and Skip Essex settled for
second place in the two mile and
and 440-yard races respectively.

This afternoon the thinclads op-
pose Lynchburg and it seems the
coaches feel they should win. Three
more meets remain with ithe state
and CAC meets following the sea-
son.

With two of the General tennis

stars out of action—Jim DeYoung
and John Baker—the W&L netters
still encountered little trouble with
Lynchburg as they shut out the
Hornets, 9-0, Friday on the Wash-
ington and Lee courts.

Randy Jones, playing in the num-
ber one position easily downed his
opponent, 6-1, 6-2, while Jim Mell
and Lindsey Short both won with-
out trouble, 6-1, 6-1. Forrest Dickin-
son, Howard Busse, and Fred Webb
all trounced their opponents easily to
complete the singles sweep .

Doubles Sweep

In the doubles matches, the first
team of Jones and Short won 6-3,
6-1, and the other two matches
went just as easily as Dickinson
and Mell scored 6-1, 6-2, and the
Busse-Webb team completed the
sweep by winuning 6-1, 6-3.

Today the netters risk their fine
8-2 record against the Spiders of the
University of Richmond. The match-
es, to be played on the W&L courts,
began at 3:15.

Tuesday Sports Writer

The Generals’ nine of coach Joe
Lyles were easy victims of the
R.P.I. Rams, and handed the visitors
a 13-4 decision through a gift of
nine errors.

The Generals’ entire staff except-
ing Chris Wigert was used in a
vain attempt ‘to put out the fire, but
giving the Rams an average of four
outs per inning sapped the effort
and moral of W&L hurlers.

It was an offensive game with
each collecting ten hits, but the
Generals were given only two errors
which made the difference in score.
A pair of four-run innings broke
the game open for the Rams while
W&L’s hits and runs were well
scattered.

Big hitters for W&L continued to
be shortstop Dave Kirkpatrick and
outfielder Ashley Allen who collect-
ed three and two hits respectively.
Tom Crenshaw’s play at his new
outfield position was also cited and
his strong arm combined with Allen’s
game make the Generals a more de-
fensively potent outfield.

Ft. Bragg Today

The W&L nine is now 1-5-1 for
intercollegiate play. They played
the Ft. Brogg Dragons today in a
non-seasonal game in hopes of
registering a win against their
Spring Vacation rivals who handed
them three defeats at that time. Co-
captain Brice Gamber was given the
nod as starting pitcher. Thursday
the Generals travel to Bridgewater
also hoping to avenge an earlier loss.

of Old Dominion (May 2) and

Wahoos Edge W&L Linksters;
Go On To Beat Old Dominion

By JIM CROTHERS
Tuesday Sports Editor
VIRGINIA
In a very close match, Washing-
ton and Lee’s golf team lost two
individual contests one-up and al-
lowed the University of Virginia to
edge the General linksters, 4'2-

2%.

Roger Sennott of W&L was lead-
ing his match with the Wahoo’s
Dell Lanceford putting on the last
green, but the Cavalier sank a
thirty-foot putt to half the match
thus depriving the Generals of at
least a tie in the overall contest.

Bill Wiley was very impressive
as he defeated Bob Verity of UVa.,
2-1. Verity, incidentally, is a past
winner of the state intercollegiate
title. Washington and Lee’s only
other winner, besides Sennot’s tie,
was Mike Gocke who defeated Henry
Warren, two and one.

Bob Duckwall and Steve Henry
both lost fairly close matches to
their Cavalier opponents, while Ed
Crosland and Dick Drew were both
defeated one-up. Virginia's Mike

Mixed Emotions of Audience

A word about the last scene. In
this seene we see what may be des-
cribed as a ballet of bombs, with a
sad song “We'll meet Again,” being
sung in the background. I have yet
to meet two people whom it affected
in just the same way. One laughed
loudly, one laughed but felt he
shouldn’t, one cried, one was dumb-
struck and couldn’t explain, even to
himself, how he felt, one felt the
full impact of the horror of the
nightmarish events he had just
watched. And, finally, one watched
the bombs and thought they were
beautiful, listened to the song and
thought it was pretty. He came, in
his own way, to love the bomb.

Great Artistic Success

This movie is much more than an
anti-war film. It is a cynical, critical
comment on man and the world he
has created. By exaggerating his
characters, by exaggerating the sit-
uation, Kubrick has made us laugh,
at a world that is, primarily, the
one in which we live. He has shown

glory of their death. They died un-

faith in their hearts, and on their
lips hope that we would go on to

Honor—Country . ..”

 

Perhaps only Winston Churchill
did more with words to inspire the
war-torn people of the last genera-
tion.

Finally, MacArthur will be re-
membered as a man of ideals. For a
successful soldier this idealism
may seem odd in a number of ways;
yet to him words such as “Duty,”
“Honor,” “Country” came naturally
and sincerely. His ideals were those
of a soldier and a patriot. These
ideals made him the soldier he was
and they created around him the
legend and popularity that still ex-
ists. He was able to couple these
ideals with the realism it takes to
wage successful war, and the out-
come was a great general and a liv-
ing legend. Now he is dead, but in
America, in Tokyo, in the Solo-
mons—MacArthur will be remem-
bered.

Before being appointed to his
cabinet post in 1961 by the late
President John F. Kennedy, Secre-
tary Rusk served as president of
the Rockefeller Foundation for nine
years. Previously he was professor
of political science and government
and Dean of the Faculty at Mills
College and held positions in the
War Department and Department of
State. He served as an infantry of-
ficer in Burma during World War
I.

He was president of the Davidson

Kappa during his senior year be-
sides being elected to Phi Beta

 

Kappa and named a Rhodes Scholar.
Shannon a W&L Alumnus

After receiving his A.B. degree
summa cum laude from Washington
and Lee in 1939, Dr. Shannon
studied at Duke University, receiv-
ing an M.A. in 1941. After service
in the Navy during World War II, he
attended Oxford University as a
Rhodes Scholar and won his Ph.D.
degree.

He taught at Harvard and the
University of Virginia of which he
was named president in 1959. His
special field of study is 19th Cen-

 

tury English literature with empha-
sis on Alfred Lord Tennyson. Dr.
Shannon is the only American who
is an honorary vice president of
the Tennyson Society.

Barry Bishop is only 32 years old,
but has already had an outstanding
career as explorer, geographer,
writer and photographer. He partic-
ipated in the first ascent on the
western buttress of Mt. McKinley
in 1951; was in the Himalayan Ex-
pedition led by Sir Edmund Hillary
in 1960-61 and one of a party of
four to reach the previously un-

hustle is the fact they they re-
covered more ground balls than did
the Cavaliers.

Never a Contest

The Villanova game was never a
contest in that the Generals scored
six goals in the first period and five
each in the three remaining quar-
ters. The Wildcats got their one
seore late in the second frame.

John McDaniel paced the winners’
attack with four goals and four as-
sists, while Carroll Klingelhofer had
two goals and four assists. Mike
Michaels and Randy Wootton had
three goals each, while Bob Hankey
and freshman Duncan LaMonte
notched two each. Single goals were
scored by Bobby Ostroff, Bob Frost,
Pat Robertson, Jay Bowersox, and
Syd Butler.

Defense Good

The defense was again superb, al-
though it wasn’t tested by the Wild-
cats. Pete Noonan made nine saves
and John Eddy Moore made two.
Werhun stopped nineteen shots for
the losers. The Generals fired 69
shots at him.

McHenry was very satisfied with

his club’s showing. “The opposition
didn’t lower our calibre of play.
We moved the ball well and got
good shots,” commented McHenry
with a pleased tone of voice.
t was a team effort as illustrated
by the 16 assists. Generally there is
one assist for every two goals. This
statistic shows that the passing was
good. The winners also did another
good job in controlling the ground
balls with a 79-21 advantage.

Brownell Names Six
To Organize ‘Contact’

By BILL CANNON
Blaine Brownell, Chairman of Contact, and Henry Queke-
meyer, Assistant Chairman, today announced the selection
of the remainder of the Steering Committee and their As-
sistants for next year’s weekend. Brownell also explained the
purpose of Contact in an interview with the Friday Ring-tum

Phi.

Newly elected members of the Steering Committee are Vic-

Galef Treasurer, Chip Roadman,*
Secretary, Larry Meeks, Publicity
Chairman, Jody Brown, Program
Coordinator, Pete Dinkel, Registra-
tion Chairman and Steve Hibbard,
Social Chairman.

Symposium

“Contact will be an Intercollegiate
Symposium presented ‘on behalf of
the administration, faculty, and stu-
dents of W&lL under the auspices
of the Interfraternity Council. In-
vitations will be sent to all colleges
and Universities on the East Coast,
and we expect at least 500 outside
students and visitors will partici-
pate,” Brownell commented. “It will
consist of an entire wekend of lec-
tures, discussions, and seminars with
guest speakers from colleges, foun-
dations, the government, churches,
and other organizations. We will at-
tempt to bring to this campus some
of the most controversial figures of
our time; people who have some-
thing to say. We will not invite
these speakers on the basis of po-
litical beliefs, religious belief, race
or social status.”

“The American Experience”

In aecord with the theme, “The
American Experience: It’s Implica-
tions For the Individual American,
the American Nation , and the
World,” Brownell explained, “We
will approach this intellectual prob-
lem along political, sociological, his-
torical, religious, economic, and
scentifie lines. This will all be with-
in the general framework of trans-
lating the American experience (ab-
stract as it is) on all levels into
modern conceptions and into a
meaningful knowledge for applica-
tion to the problems of a modern,
often confusing world,

“We do present varying view-
points and different aspects and ap-
proaches to an overall intellectual
problem. The theme was chosen for
two reasons: (1) to offer the widest
possible variety of speakers and
specific topics that would still ‘fit’
into a central unifying theme, and
(2) to offer the widest possible ap-
peal to the greatest number of peo-
ple--every intelligent person will be
able to get something of value from
Contact.”

Quakemeyer added, “Contact
needs the support, advice, and en-
couragement of every member of the
Washington and Lee student body
and of the faculty and administra-
tion. We will attempt to supple-
ment the present academic program

 

 

at W&L on the largest scale pos-
sible.”

“We feel that it is a burden on
everyone working on Contact, and
on all of Washington and Lee, to
assure that the first Contact will be
a success. It could be of inestimable
value to the University, and if it is
to be continued, it must succeed.
We will simply need the help of
everyone associated with Washing-
ton and Lee. With this we cannot
fail.”

Steering Committee

The Steering Committee will be
assisted by special committee who
will coordinate the work of the
weekend.

Galef, a ZBT from White Plains,
N. Y., will hhandle the finance of
the weekend. Assistant treasurers
include Ken Bernhardt, Harry Den-
nery, Patton Adams, and Rick Mar-
golis.

Roadman, secretary, is a Phi Gam
from Colorado Springs, Col., who
will be assisted by Jim Steen, Ed
Wood and John Zink.

Meeks, an SPE from Thomaston,
Georgia, will lead the publicity drive
necessary to put over the first Con-
tact. He has Billy Cannon, Dan

UCA to Present
Baumann Talk

Dr. Dieter Baumann will lecture
April 29, at 7:30 p.m. in duPont
Hall on the topic: “An Example
Illustrating Jungian Thought.” In
this lecture he will try to access
the thought of C. G. Jung on con-
temporary man’s understanding of
himself.

Baumann is a practicing pschiatric
analyst in Zurich, Switzerland. Be-
sides his private practice, he is on
the teaching staff of the C. G. Jung
Institute in Zurich. He is presently
touring the United States under the
auspices of the C. G. Jung Foun-
dation. While on tour, he is lecturing
at many of the leading universities
and medical schools in this country.

Baumann’s visit to Washington
and Lee promises to explore more
deeply the relationships between
psychiatry and theology. These two
fields overlap considerably. They
have the same focus: namely, they
both try to deal with the human
mind, emotions and structure of per-

Indian Speaks
On Tribal Life

By Warren Montgomery

Mr. Joe Sun Hawk, a Pueblo In-
dian from a reservation in New
Mexico, spoke before ReVue Tues-
day night. The content of his talk,
“Sunrise—a View from the Indian
Side,” was designed to give the
audience a feeling for the life of the
Indian today, his place in the Ameri-
can scene, his adherence to the past,
and his religious attitudes.

Mr. Sun Hawk did not attempt
to follow any pattern of thought in
his lecture; nor did the draw any
conclusions. Instead, he tried to
make his listeners understand what
sort of person the Indian is by a
combination of autobiographical an-
ecdotes and demonstrations.

Mr. Sun Hawk is, to begin with,
a truly typical Indian, not the Amer-
icanized Indian philosopher that
the ReVue audience first anticipated.
He is of Pueblo and Ajpachee des-
cent and is the grandson of the fa-
mous Geronimo. His home is the
Taos Pueblo, near Alburquerque,
where he is an important chief. Mr.
Sun Hawk raises cattle for a living
but he paints and writes poetry on
the side.

Indian Costume

During his stay here, Mr. Sun
Hawk wore traditional tribal garb—
a blue, knee-length tunic; black
breeches; white, embroidered slip- |
pers; and a scarlet serape. He wears
his hair long and braided.

Speaking of his people, Mr. Sun
Hawk stressed their close sense of
unity with the past, and their desire
to continue the ancient tribal cus-
toms. He said that the Pueblos live
happily on their reservations, receiv-
ing free school and free hospital
care. Each Indian has been given
160 acres of land, upon which he
usually raises cattle.

The predominant religion of Mr.
Sun Hawk’s people is a modified
form of Christianity—the American
Church (of which Mr. Sun Hawk
is a leader). Unable to completely
accept the European Christian theol-
egy, the Pueblos have combined
it with their ancient religious forms.
“Church services” last eight hours
and are at night in the American
Chureh, and they are conducted in
a wigwam. Peyote is substituted for
the traditional communion wine, and
ceremonial rattles and feathers play
a significant part in the rites. Old
Testament concepts, notably the
Ten Commandments, are rejected.
The only creed of the Indians is

faculty advisers attending the 35th
annual SIPA convention.

Delegates and advisers to this
year’s convention will represent ap-
proximately 175 preparatory and
high schools from eight Souhtern
states and the District of Columbia.

Childs and “Free Press”

Childs will be the first to appear
before the convention. He will dis-
cuss “The Free Press in a Revolu-
tionary Age” at 12:05 p.m. Friday,
May 1, in Washington and Lee’s
Doremus Gymnasium.

Sagendorf will give the delegates
a look at “Life With Popeye,” in a
talk at 1:55 p.m. May 1 in the gym-
nasium.

Trussell is scheduled to appear be-
fore the SIPA convention at 11:10
a.m. Saturday, May 2 to discuss “In-
terviewing Newsmakers: How and
Why.” He will speak in Lee Chapel.

All three speeches will be open
to the public.

Rise to Success

Childs has been a newspaper man
for 40 years, beginning his career in
1923 by getting a job with United
Press in Chicago immediately after
graduating from the University of
Wisconsin. In the 1930’s he studied
and reported the economic and social
effects of changing governmental
policies in Europe. He was named
Washington correspondent of the St.
Louis Post-Dispatch in 1934.

During World War II he was an
overseas correspondent in Europe
and South America. In 1944 his now-
famous column, “Washington Call-
ing,” was started and although he
continues to make Washington his
home base, Childs travels all over
the world to report first hand major
diplomatic conferences, international
crisis and summit or near-summit
meetings.

Sagendorf says of his work: “I
not only love my work and feel
sorry for anyone who only gets to
read the comics, but it’s also more
fun to draw them.”

While he was still in high school
in California, Sagendorf went to
work on the comic strip and later
became assistant comic art director
for Features Syndicate.

The Birth of “Popeye”

But when the syndicate decided
to do a “Popeye” comic magazine,
Sagendorf was asked to draw and
white the whole publication. In
1959, he again took over the daily
and Sunday Popeye strip while con-
tinuing to do the magazine.

Trussell is a journalism graduate
of Washington and Lee University
where he was elected to Sigma Delta
Chi, professional journalism society.

Since graduation he has been a
reporter and Washington correspon-
dent for the St. Petersburg (Fla.)
Times, was on the editorial staff
of Congressional Quarterly News
Features, and was in the Washing-
ton bureau of The Wall Street Jour-
nal,

dent of the Commerce School; Tim
O'Keefe, Lambda Chi, for vice-pres-
dent of Liberal Arts; Ashley Allen,
KA, for vice-president of the Sci-

An Evaluation Of Sines

The campaign is over, the honor system and the assimila-
tion committee are still intact, and life at W&L remains relative-
ly unchanged except for an acceleration in hour quizzes and
exam aprehension.

There has been much talk in the past week about the
honor system. Indeed, election week seems to be one of the few
times that the honor system is ever considered on campus.
Both parties supported the “‘system,”’ but at best the issue was
a superfluous one; everyone does support the honor system.
It is as much a part of our lives as the wejuns and regimental
stripe we put on for the early morning dash to the 8:25
classes.

And with good reason. For the honor system is a distinc-
tive feature of Washington and Lee, placing our campus head
and shoulders above the average college or university. The
honor system has had a great deal to do in establishing the
image of the Washington and Lee man—an image that we
should be proud of and support wholeheartedly.

We have heard this for such a long time that we tend to
take it for granted. No one questions the benefit to the indi-
vidual student of making him think for himself, and not copy
term papers word for word from some reference work on his
topic. The sense of personal integrity and self-respect
which it establishes is not something to scorn or be
ashamed of. It is only when we consider what life here would
be like without the honor system that we catch a glimpse of
the breadth of its influenced. Pencil guarding, cheating, theft—
all these facets of normal college life are unknown.

And yet, maybe we have misplaced the emphasis. Is our
concern so much with the system or with the honor which
the system breeds? Is it not true that the system is merely
an instrument, a tool which is used to evoke a sense of honor in
every student? The honor created is more important than,
and it is entirely separate from, the way in which it is created.
The means are hardly as important as the results which they
produce. It is not the system which has established W&L as
an honorable institution, but the honor which the system has
created. The system is important only for the results it pro-

vides. It is because the results are invaluable that the system |,

itself is of real importance.

The honor system is not to be taken for granted. Election
week and exam week must not be the only times that honor
receives emphatic consideration.

IFC Group Discusses W&L Social Life

By LARRY MEEKS

Approximately eighty guests at-
tended the second of ‘this year’s IFC
sponsored faculty-student discus-
sions last night at the Robert E.
Lee Hotel. Fifteen girls, student
leaders from Randolph-Macon, Hol-
lins and Sweet Briar, attended the
discussion in addition to the facul-
ty members and IFC representatives.

In view of the innovation of ask-
ing student leaders from the sur-
rounding women’s colleges, much of
the discussion centered around so-
cial activities at W&L with sever-
al groups concentrating on this topic.

It was generally felt that com-
bos were a “problem” because of
the combination of the noise, alcohol
and shedding of inhibitions. It was

brought up that the girls were just |

as responsible for the conduct as
the boys and that they were, per-
haps, in the best position to im-
prove conditions by demanding re-
spect from their dates and protest-
ing against undesirable aspects of
combo weekends.

It was also pointed out that per-
haps the enthusiasm for combo par-
ties was less than it has been, es-
pecially among the upperclassmen,
but that combo parties still main-
tain their undesirable traits. It was
also pointed out that there is little
to do in Lexington if you don’t care
for combo parties, and almost noth-
ing to do on “off” weekends.

Another group concluded that
combo parties are degenerate in that
they contribute to the lowering of

 

one’s morals. It was pointed out

that the parties in themselves are| ties.”

that give the parties their unde-

‘Victors’ Presents Simply And Openly
The Horrors And Agony Of World War

By BOB MOTTLEY

The Victors is a memorable film,
remarkable for what it contributes in
a simple and open
way rather than
through the sleek

and aseptic so-
phistication so
fashionable in

some cinema cir-
cles. There are not
many nuances,
but a _ series of
shattering emo-
tional episodes,
beautifully _ pre-
sented by a large
and talented cast. Carl Foreman’s
basic plan was to read _ personal
events into a news reel format; this
documentary method works well,
although there are gaps in the ac-
tion. If you have the usual movie
mind, (tenth grade caliber) you will
spend most of the evening wonder-
ing what has been happening to
various soldiers. With a little imag-
ination, however, you should see
that Foreman is dipping into groups
of personalities as they are wearied
and cheapened by the prolonged
trauma of war; what is left vague
and diffuse is quite as important
as what is clearly understood. We
do not have to know how Corporal
Frank Chase was wounded; we
should be concerned with his psy-
chotic state afterwards. The Victors
is not an epic as such, but a delin-
ination of the agony and horror of
a few individuals across the hideous

Mottley

 

tapestry that was the Second War
in Europe. The “image” of Johnny
abroad is not a favorable one, and
the difference between the trenches
and ithe home front is made unmis-
takably apparent through a superb
“misfusion” of music against mont-
age. Veterans have been moved be-
yond tears by The Victors, perhaps
because the film uses as a point of
departure a poem by Winifred Owen,
the brilliant young British poet
killed in the First World War (the
one to end them all, remember?),
that is as much a warning as a
lament. To express precisely what
Owen and Foreman are trying to
say, I must be blunt and hope that
you are intensely angered by what
must be said, for only then will
you understand it .

Let us take the average Washing-
ton and Lee student. He is, by his
own admitted standards, prejudiced,
jaded, “cool” instead of passionate,
taught to despise sentiment, to de-
test phonies in the only genuine
things he will ever know; he re-
flects (mostly) a political conserva-
tism that is as stupid as it is ar-
chaic; he is trained for a rut and
expected to conform to a grid of be-
havior sweetened with gentlemanly
overtones. He takes life lightly and
his country for granted. He has
never gone hungry, or dirty, or
been desperately afraid. He is taught
by habit and career requisites to
wear at all times to class a mental
contraceptive, so that he will never
have to worry about being creative.

He enjoys thinking of himself as a
shackmaster: sex is a weekend thrill
instead of the cement for a marriage.
God is whatever Playboy approves.
He is also taught, by implication,
that he must be as an alumnus a
ratfink in the rat race; that it is
honorable and fitting to pursue the
Almighty—dollar, that is. Status and
flesh are his idols; superiority and
suaveness are his icons. Tis one real
fear is that at some point in his life
he will be called on to be a genuine
person and he will wash out. He has
it so soft that when he sees a film
like The Victors he will sneer man-
mully and comment: “Jesus, what
trash!”

Things were probably worse in
1943; suppose we take Slog and set
him down with an M-1 in Europe
just after D-day. Suddenly, his life
is pruned to esesntials; his idols
are reduced to survival and flesh.
The rosy visions of honor and
gentlemanly sportsmanship dissolve
into tthe harshness of conybat: our
former stud is now dirty, stinking,
unshaven, living, cheating, stealing,
and killing brutally all of his wak-

God, country, or Roosevelt, but for
his own damn neck. The agony and
horror of war distort his mind to
the point where he is grateful for
the aesthetic beauty of a roll of
toilet paper. “Meaning and exist-
ence” consists of not bing shot by
a sniper, or having his groin torn

Doctor Examines Lewis’ Medical Care

Dear Editor:

The Ring-tum Phi issues of March
20 and 27 carry an appraisal of
medical care by Syd Lewis that
should not go unexamined.

First, it is logically untenable to
compare the vital statistics of the
U.S. with those of the homogeneous
nations of Europe. Our vital statist-
ies are unfavorably influenced by
a significant and increasing Negro
minority, a broad geographic area
with numerous sparsely _ settled
communities, a lack as yet of true
homogeneity of our more numerous
people with persisting pockets of
differences in culture, habits, etc.
International comparisons are tricky
and until such a time when social,
economic, racial and other factors
equalize between nations, it is futile
to make comparisons.

Second, it is also not tenable to|
propose state medicine because the |
rise of medical care cost is out of |
line with other services. In any |
comparative study of prices, the |
Consumer Price Index “does not re-|
flect changes in quality occurring
over a period of time.... The na-|
ture of the health services provided
to the public has been changing so
greatly and so rapidly that there is

 

 

some question whether the items for
which price information is collected
remain comparable over substantial
periods of time, or reflect the kinds
of medical services and drugs ac-
tually being purchased.” (Blue Cross
& American Hospital Assn.—Financ-
ing Health Care of the Aged, 1962,
p. 74.) Simply stated, the higher cost
is not for the same services.

The quality difference in med-
ical care and cost lies in such
items as more expensive and ef-
fective drugs, better laboratories
with new diagnostic tests, new
and better equipment, more hos-
pital trained personnel, and the
many health restoring services
that didn’t exist 20, or even 10
years, ago.

The Department of Commerce
figures show that physicians’ fees,
in purchasing power, are actually
less than those of 20 years ago (1960
figures). The largest increase in
medical costs occurred in hospital
care (343 per cent from ’40 to ’60).
This is largely due to the cost of
labor (an increase of 520 per cent
since 1947) which accounts for 70
per cent to 80 per cent of present
day hospital budgets. (Yet, one won-
ders what motive led the Secretary

 

of Labor to announce recently that
hospital personnel are still under-
paid).

To the opponents of state medi-
cine, the latest U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics are encourging. The
Bureau reported that the rise in the
medical care component of the Con-
sumers Price Index for 1963 was
the smallest in a decade. While pre-
viously rising at about twice the rate
of prices in general, medical care
prices are now going up at about
the same pace.

There are many qualified opinions
supporting and opposing state med-
icine. Such divergent opinions in
educated men of undoubted integri-
ty are the result of varied intellec-
tual and emotional evaluations due
to differences in upbringing, educa-
tion, experiences, interests, etc.
Hence, it is not surprising to see
these opposing points of view in
print and to cite one qualified au-
thority to contradict another. Oc-
cassionally, however, a discerning
remark may lead to better under-
standing of divergent views. Such a
comment appears in a footnote in
the Winter ’61-62 issue of Modern
Age by A. A. Shenfield, Economic
Director of the Federation of British

 

Industries (London). It deals with
the British Health Service and reads
as follows: “There are some things
in Britain that the people love to
tell themselves are the best of their
kind in the world.... this tendency
to pat ourselves on the back (we
even pat ourselves on the back for
not blowing our own trumpet!) can
have a powerful political influence.
Thus the left has propagated the
preposterous myth that we have a
National Health Service which is
the envy of the world. Described in
this way, the National Health Serv-
ice comes to excite pride even in
the Conservative’s heart, despite his
awareness of its many defects” (p.
55).

Another clue to better under-
standing these differences occurs
in the preface written by F, A.

Hayek to Financing Medical Care—
An Appraisal of Foreign Programs
(edited by H. Schoek, Caxton, 1962).
“It is a difficult task to obtain sober
and reliable evaluations and as-
sessments of activities which have
been monopolized by governments
and where the tendency in this di-
rection is generally favored by fash-
ionable political opinion and official
international organizations. But for

 

a people (U.S.) not yet committed
to such developments, it is most im-
portant that the public should be-
come aware of the other side of the
coin (p. VI-VII).

Those who advocate state medi-
cine seem to forget that physicians
are an integral part of the free en-
terprise system. While of some min-
or advantage to doctors, the history
of compulsory medical care systems
overseas in recent years, and even
today, is one where the medical
profession is at the mercy of the
government (it is such publicity that
is partly influencing medical school
applications). The authority direct-
ing medical care has complete pow-
er to decide what the people (pa-
tients) and doctors are to be given
and what terms.

The proper role of government in
a free enterprise economy precludes
compulsory medical care approaches
which abrogate the rights not only
of those receiving the care but also
of those providing the care. The
freedom of the people to choose the
type, extent and quality of medical
care depends upon the existence of
a medical profession that is similarly
unfettered in its freedom to fulfill
these desires. Edward Palmer, M.D.

The girls also felt that the com-

Baur Writes
On Elections

By DREW BAUR

Contrary to Rod Cockshutt’s opin-
ion, I don’t believe the last election
was “an obedient homage to our
own peculiar sacred cows.” This is
an insult to the intelligence of any
W&L student.

What the election of Jim Kulp and
the recent Ring-tum Phi elections
prove is that the school is conser-
vative in the barest sense of the
word. Did it ever occur to you, Mr.
Cockshutt, that the average student
here is satisfied with W&lL.? I did not
say apathetic, but satisfied. Most
of the people at W&L like it here,
appreciate the honor system, re-
spect the EC. From this point of
view we are conservative. We wish
to conserve what we have, because
time has proved it is a workable,
just student government.

It is not a system beyond criticism,
and certainly there are other possi-
bilities concerning the working of
a student government. However,
these recent elections show that most
students feel that Washington and
Lee should remain under our pres-
ent system. To say ‘that it is imma-
ture to accept change, only for the
sake of change, is, I think, in itself
immature.

Finally, I feel a word needs to be
said about Cockshutt’s attack on the
Delt and SPE houses. I am a mem-
ber of the Progressive Party and,
quite naturally, was not particularly
overjoyed to see them leave. How-
ever, whatever their reasons, they
were not immature ones. One house
bolted because they simply could
not justify one nominee’s candidacy;
the other bolted because they
thought their candidate was worthy
of a higher office. To charge them
with immaturity sounds like sour
grapes somewhere, and there should
not be any room for bitterness in
politics.

The year’s first Brown Cow
Award goes to Frank Bailey. After
driving all afternoon in search of
the Thornton Sisters, he finally

finding them, though, he forgot that

END: Dodgers to continue losing

Dear Editor:

Re: Above letter

1. Even when Negroes are om-
mited from the statistics, the U.S.
remains inferior in almost all the
statistics I used. Furthermore, if
certain groups suffer more, then
medicine has failed to provide them
proper care.

2. Since 1958 (Base 100) services
have risen to 111 and medical serv-
ices to over 120.

3. Admittedly, the National Health
Service has not lived up to its ex-
pectations; however, this is only one
country. The story is different in
New Zealand. Moreover, as I stated
before, what is good for one coun-
is not good for all countries. This
is exemplified by captalism which
has failed in almost every part of
the world.

4. Our enterpise system is not
completely free. We found out in
the thirties that such a system was
unworkable. Now we must decide
where medical services fit in our
controlled economy.

Generals Lose Again, 12-5
For Second Loss in Week

The baseball Generals lost their third straight yesterday

to Bridgewater 12-5.

Again errors—five of them—were the team’s undoing.
Bridgewater scored just six earned runs.

Bridgewater led from the start, scoring three runs on a hit
and three errors. They sewed up the game in the fifth, scoring

 

Golfers Prepare

For Tournament

Washington and Lee’s golf team
beat Roanoke 8-1 Wednesday, met
Bridgewater here this afternoon,
and Monday has a very good chance
to challenge for the state cham-
pionship it has won three times.

Dick Drew and Mike Gocke tied
for medalist honors Wednesday
both shooting 72’s over the Lexing-
ton course. Both beat ‘their oppon-
ents eight and seven.

Roanoke’s only victory was re-
corded by Gary Coach, who de-
feated Bob Duckwall one up.

Twelve schools will gather Mon-
day at Hot Springs for the 36-hole
State Intercollegiate Tournament to
be played on Cascades Golf Course.

Virginia’s Cavaliers are defend-
ing champions in the medalist play

feated defending individual cham-
pion John Verity in a dual match
earlier this year.

Wednesday’s victory gave

It was the second game of the
week for W&L and the loss lowered
their collegiate record to 1-6-1. The
team is 2-10-1 overall.

Tuesday Fort Bragg scored six
runs in the first two innings and
coasted to a 10-2 win.

Dragon third baseman Gary Ewing
led the way in the five-run second
with a two run homer. He later
drew three walks, singled, and stole
two bases.

Dave Kirkpatrick led the Gener-
als with three hits in four at bats.
Responsible for both W&L runs,
Kirkpatrick tripled in the sixth to
drive in pitcher Pete Heumann, then
scored on Ashley Alllen’s fly ball.

Heumann looked good in relief,
giving up but one hit in three shut-
out innings.

Netters Extend Streak To Nine;
To Face SC Champion Monday

The varsity tennis team soundly
defeated two opponents this week,
running their winning streak to
nine matches.

Playing at home against Richmond
Tuesday, it swept to a 9-0 victory
without the loss of a set. Wednes-
day, playing at Death Valley, the
team beat Hampden-Sydney 8-1.

Tuesday the Generals will face
their toughest test. George Wash-
ington will be here and with them
will be Harvey Harrison, Southern
Conference singles champion last
year, and Buddy Goeltz, one of
the outstanding players in the Wash-
ington area.

Coach Bill Washburn said of the
match, “We consider the George

Washington match as the strongest

test of the team this season. The
boys could use all the support pos-
sible from student spectators.”

W&L will be strengthened in this,
the last home match of the year, by
the return of captain Jim DeYoung,
who has missed most of the season
because of a side injury.

John Baker, playing his first two
matches this week, should also be
in top shape. The varsity will be
at its top potential for George Wash-
ington.

ond match of the season Wednesday,

Trackmen Win Fourth
Despite Changes in Lineup

The Washington and Lee track
team, despite serious changes in
the running events, ran its win
streak to four and its season rec-
ord ito 4-1 Tuesday with an 85-60
win over Lynchburg College.

Coach Norm Lord made changes
in his runners, so that more men
could compete. Although the changes
made a difference in the point
spread, it was obvious from the start
that the Generals would have no
trouble.

Lord made such changes as plac-
ing quarter miler Skip Essex in the
880, and did not use star sprinter
Chris Kell in the sprints. The meet
was a good indication of the depth
that the Generals possess, and a
cheerful sign of things to come.

That depth can be used to best
advantage tomorrow at the Davidson
Relay meet. The trackmen were
runners-up in the affair last year
and Lord has high hopes of taking
top honors this year.

The meet, to be televised locally
in Charlotte, is composed of schools
about the size of Washington and
Lee.Lord is very optimistic about the
outcome, and is taking a full squad
of 18 men.

moves into the heavy part of the
schedule. The game, against the
North Carolina Tar Heels, is sche-
duled for 3 p.m.

Carolina will probably be the
Generals’ toughest opponent to date,
about on a par with Williams (who
beat the Generals 9-4).

The Tar Heels have played only
three games thus far, losing to Vir-
ginia 18-4, Washington (Md.) 17-5,
and Maryland 25-3. However, all
three of those teams are among
the top ten in the country. The
coaching staff does not consider
such lopsided scores indicative of
Carolina’s real ability.

Lacks Experience
Carolina is big and fast, with good
personnel, but lacks experience, par-

fense. According to defense coach

Carolina attackman Parker is 6’ 6”
and one of the best stickhandlers
the Generals will have to face.
Crease attackman Thayer is also
an excellent stickman, and goalie
Stanley is one of the best in the
country.

Center midfielders Williams, Tyler
and Howe (playing in that order)
are all competent, but the wing
midfielders lack experience.

Carolina’s offense is built around
their more than solid attackmen.
On defense they play either a zone
or man-for-man, but are expected
to play the former against W&L.

They depend mostly on the quick
clear or the Gilman clear to Parker,

“Mister T” they call him. He’s
career army, currently coaching the
Third Army champions. Last year
the wire services chose him all-
service baseball coach of the year.

“Mr. T.” is John Tatalajaski and
his team is the Fort Bragg Drag-
ons, who beat W&L Tuesday, 10-2.
His team, defending champions of
the East Coast Inter-Service Con-
ference, currently sports a 13-3
record, four of those victories
coming against the Generals.

He does have a bit of talent with
which to work. Three men—utility
man Dick Schmidt, catcher Mike
Stubbins and outfielder Bill Baker—
are owned by major league teams,
the former two by the Dodgers, and
Baker by Cincinnati.

Tatalajaski, a 21-year army man,
has a bit of non-pro help too. Wit-
ness pitcher Bob “Blood” Burns.
Burns, named All-Army pitcher
last season, pitched four games in
the army tournament. All four were
shutouts.

The tennis team will probably be
10-2 after this afternoon’s match
with Bridgewater. As a matter of
fact, they’re so good they should
beat Virginia.

Their toughest match, however,
will be Tuesday, against George
Washington, defending Southern
Conference champions. It’s at 3
p.m, and if you’re ever going to
spend an hour leaning over the
longest concrete footbridge of its
kind in the world, that’s the time
to do it.

Incidentally, you might take a look
at Howard Busse, who’s been play-
ing number six. Busse doesn’t have

a backhand. Ambidextrous, he
switches the racket from hand to
hand.

Another fellow with a unique
style is high hurdler Lem Mickle.
Not wanting to expend all that en-
ergy jumping, he just knocks over
all the hurdles. Must work—he won
the event in Tuesdays’ track meet
with Lynchburg. Time: 18.6.

Gay Gasque again took the shot
put and discus Tuesday, but no
record in the shot. Gasque had to
settle for 45’ 10”. Maybe he won’t
hit 50 this year after all.

Saturday Classes

Another group discussed Satur-

felt by both faculty members and
students that they are undesirable.
It was felt that neither students
nor faculty members gain much in
these classes. It was pointed out that
perhaps, a five day week would
possibly take some pressure off stu-
dents allowing more outside work
and time for relaxing. It was noted
that the four day week has worked
very well at Randolph-Macon.
There was a strong feeling for dis-
missing classes on big weekends and
it was noted that this would only
be done at Openings and Springs.

Mr. Sun Hawk particularly em-

After the second week, it looks
like SPE and ZBT have virtually
clinched playoff berths in I-M soft-
Championships in the other
two leagues are still up for grabs.

In the week’s finest performance,
Phi Gam’s Sammy Simpson batted
in seven runs in leading Phi Gam
to an 11-3 victory over Phi Delt.
Bill Cason helped out, limiting Phi
Delt to just four hits.

The week’s top pitching per-
formance, however, was turned in
by ZBT’s Stu Yoffe. He stopped
Phi Kap with just three hits in
leading ZBT to a 6-1 victory.

In a close contest, Beta nipped
Law 9-8 in a game that went 10
innings. The regulation seven in-
nings had ended in a 3-3 tie. Both
clubs tallied three times in the
eighth, and Beta finally came out
on top by scoring three more in
the tenth.

On the whole, games this week

saw much better pitching than

suggest only the prospects of getting
drunk on 3.2 beer, having a piece
of stray tail on occasion, and watch-
ing a bad Frank Sinatra movie over
and over when the quartermaster
fouls up and forgets to connect with
a new flick. Deplorable as this sit-
uation was (and could easily be
again), Corporal Slog at least comes,
through the agony and horror of
war, to be thankful for life. Never
again will he take it so cheaply.
If he lives to be a Victor, his only
“victory” will be his improbable
existence as a completely sane man
when the stupidity abates into a
time of peace, and he can try to re-
construct the old ways.

Owen sadly despaired that there
would be a Second War; Foreman
suggests that there may be a Third,
and it may not end easily for every-
one in a rosy, warm glow from the
Bomb. If the United States is to
be martyred and bloodied as Eu-
rope was, our people will finally
understand at a terrible cost that life
itself is more precious than status
symbols or credit cards or any na-
tional myth of an invincible melting
pot. The living will envy the dead,
to be sure, but the irony will be
all the sharper if a few remember
Dr. Strangelove and The Victors,
two pre-Bomb films that under-
scored from two different view-
points the absurdity of war.

Foreman’s direction of The Vic-
| tors is crisp and his photography is
done in uncompromising black and
white. George Peppard, Eli Wallach,
Peter Fonda, George Hamilton,
Jeanne Moreau, Melina Mercouri,
Romy Schneider, and Elke Sommer
head the superb cast. Laugh if you
will, but I am afraid that we will
have cause to remember The Victors
long after we have forgotten next
week’s offering, Tom Jones.

Six Nominating Speakers

For Republican Candidates

The Steering Committee for the
Republican Mock Convention decid-
ed late last week on the nominat-
ing speakers for the six leading
presidential candidates. The speak-
ers were chosen on a basis of proven
ability in oratory and on their af-
finities for the candidates. The
speakers are Sandy Walton for
Governor Rockefeller, Mike Hays-
lip for Senator Goldwater, Jay
Clark for Ambassador Lodge, Bill
Noell for Mr. Nixon, Tom Budd for
Governor Scranton, and George
Craddock for Senator Smith.

In choosing the states from which
these nominations will come, every
attempt was made to conform to
what should actually be the case in
San Francisco this summer. As
Wyatt Durette, Chairman of the
tepublican Party, pointed out, how-
ever, the picture may easily change.
These selections though are hardly
essential to the success of the con-
vention. As it stands now the states
which will give the nominations are

Delaware for Rockefeller, Illinois
for Goldwater, New Hampshire for
Lodge, North Dakota for Nixon,
Pennsylvania for Seranton, and
Maine for Smith. The first three
states were chosen on the basis of
the primaries held there. Scranton

will be nominated by his home state,
because he is technically a favorite
son. The same true for Smith
in Maine. Nixon will be nominated
from North Dakota because of his
pledged support there.

Five Minute Speeches

All of these candidates except
Smith will be allowed five minutes
for the nomination and two minutes
for the second. Smith will only be
allowed three minutes for the nom-
ination, because she is not considered
to be a major candidate. In addition
to these speeches there will be
eight favorite son nominations of
two minutes each.

Sandy Walton, who will deliver
Rockefeller’s nominating speech, is
an intermediate law student and
member of Phi Gam social fraternity.
Last spring he finished among the
top three in oral argument compe-
tition in the law school and is a
member of the Moot Court Team.

‘Androcles’ Premieres Tomorrow
As Final Troubadour Production

The Troubadour Theatre of Wash-
ington and Lee is producing, as its
final play of the 1963-64 season,
Androcles and the Lion, a comedy
by George Bearnard Shaw.

Androcles is a reworking of the
famous legend about an animal-lov-
ing Christian, Androcles, who en-
counters a lame lion and soothes his
discomfort by removing a_ large
thorn from the besast’s paw. Later,
when Androcles is to be thrown to
the lions with a number of other
Christian martyrs, this prior kind-

ness is to have astonishing re-
sults.
The comedy of this famous

Shavian play derices itself from
two sources. The first is Shaw’s
inevitable wit which voices itself
in dialogue between the major
character, notably Androcles, Le-
vinia, a female Christian prisoner,
another brawny Christian named
Ferovius, the Captain, and the
Emperor. The second source of
comedy finds its strength in the
large amount of farce business
which Shaw manages superbly.
The scenes with the lion, por-
trayed in full lion costume, lead
to moments of sheer hilarity, as
does the spectacle of the Emperor
of Rome jumping up and down
and dancing with glee.

Couched among the light, humor-
ous moments of the play is a serious
discussion, fostered by Shaw, of the
myths and facts of Christianity. The
audience will find how quickly the
playwright can turn a moment of
levity suddenly into a serious philo-
sophical discussion in which he dis-
counts myths of Christianity and
makes us all aware of the reality and
strength of Faith. In such a way
this play is instructive in its con-
tent, yet humorous in its delightful
presentation.

Contributing significantly to the
humor of this production is the
set design, Executed by a student,
Gay Reading, working with Dr.
Jones and Dr, Junkin, the set con-
sists of several outlandish pieces,
including a vividly painted jungle
scene which features “drunken”
columns, which make up in novel-
ty what they lack in architectural
soundness. Reading is the first stu-
dent to design a set for the Troubs
in four years,

Androcles and the Lion will be
given at the Troubadour Theatre,
Wednesday through Saturday nights
with curtain time at 8:15 p.m. All
seats may be reserved by calling

noon this week.

Speaking to an audience largely
composed of Goldwater supporters
Friday night, Judge John Lomenzo,
Secretary of State for New York,
expounded on the attributes of pres-
idential candidate Nelson Roske-
feller.

He opened his talk with a survey
of the paramount problem of our
country: the question of survival—
especially since only 30 minutes
are now necessary to alter civiliza-
tion through nuclear bombs, the
question of foreign policy, and the
passive attitude of American voters.

To these dilemmas he added an-
other: domestic problems, Having
been a judge in New York State
for eight years, he vividly pic-
tured how a youth in New York
could “borrow” an unsuspecting
person's car for a “joy ride,” be
convicted of a felony, and then be
unable, years later, to vote, hold a
civil service position, and prebably
be accepted by a college. He cited
unemployment as another chal-
lenge.

It was Lomenzo’s contention
Rockefeller is the candidate who is
the most to satisfy these na-
tional dilemmas. Pointing to Rocke-
feller an individual, he pointed
out that Rocky was introduced into
the Federal Government at the age
of 32, and quickly rose in powel
and position. He became the Assist-
ant Secretary State South

at San Francisco, where he fought
for and received the right of indi-
vidual nations to form mutual se-
curity pacts outside of the UN. This
right opened the way for NATO,
SEATO, and other pacts.

Under the Eisenhower govern-
ment, Rockefeller drew the blue-
prints for the Health, Education,
and Welfare Department, and de-
veloped the “Open Skies” policy.
in 1958 he defeated the incumbent
for the New York Governorship
by the largest plurality recorded
in that state.

Referring to Rockefeller’s politi-
cal beliefs, Lomenzo emphasized
Rocky’s dedication to the individu-
al. A person with steady employ-
ment is a citizen that will fulfill his
obligations, whereas the unemployed

fail in their duty. Therefore, to

IFC Passes
New System
For Rushing

The Interfraternity Council last
night passed several changes in the
rush system. The most radical
change deals with a new system of
Open Houses which will replace the
initial rush in the dorms. These
Open Houses will take place during
the first two days for formal rush,
Thursday and Friday, from 7 p.m.
to 11 p.m. There will be six of these
Open House each night, each one
forty minutes long, during the first
two nights, and there will be three
more Open Houses Monday after-
noon.

Rushees Must See 10 Houses

The freshmen will be required to
see at least ten houses during the
first two nights and will not be al-
lowed to see any house more than
once. There will be no more than
thirty rushees present at any house,
and each fraternity will be given a
list of the Freshmen who will be

%*a Siegert Scholarship, and has been

| active on the Liberty Hall Com-

| mittee,

 

present at each open house at least
an hour before the beginning of |
that open house. During the open)
houses no beer can be served or
consumed.

For the open houses eight frater-
nities will be allowed to use a maxi-
mum of ten cars each. Those eight
are Phi Kappa Psi, Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, Zeta Beta Tau, Pi Kappa
Phi, Lambda Chi, Phi Epsilon Pi,
Delta Upsilon, and Kappa Sigma.
Only one fraternity man will be
allowed in each car. Those frater-
nities not allowed cars will be al-
lowed no more than ten members
to walk the rushees to and from
their respective houses.

Limited Dorm Rush

There will be limited dorm rush
for one hour on the Saturday and
Monday of Rush Week. However,
only four members from each fra-
ternity will be allowed to enter the
dorms at this time.

With the addition of the Open
Houses Rush Week will be one day
longer next year, beginning on
Thursday and ending on Wednesday.

Thirteenth Mock Convention
Could Be The Last One At W&L

John Madison’s speech before the student body last week
was a fresh interval in the dry run of compulsory student as-
semblies. Naturally Madison’s humor was appreciated and it
was taken lightly—but perhaps much too lightly.

The subject of Madison’s speech was hardly a joke,
although he spoke humorously to try to get away from a
“preaching” tone. His request that students restrain their con-
duct during the 1964 Mock Convention must not be laughed
off. Unless the student body does behave accordingly during
the convention, it will disappear in the future. This will be
the thirteenth and last Mock Convention.

The consequences for the individual student who indulges
in misconduct also will be serious. The Student Control Com-
mittee will be alert to any misbehavior during the convention,
and will judge all cases with due severity. What the town of
Lexington will do with any students it can apprehend goes

without saying.

Madison felt he could use humor in his speech because
he has a good deal of faith in the maturity of the student body.
We should all make an effort to vindicate that confidence next

week.

Steering Committee Poll

Possible Switch To Nixon
Forseen In Second Ballot

Washington and Lee University’s Mock Republican Convention
is receiving a 50 per cent return on its poll of the Republican county
chairmen in almost every county in the United States.

Nixon Gains Support

Results of the poll will not be revealed, but Philip D. Sharp, Jr.,
Chairman of the Mock Convention’s Steering Committee, is willing
to discuss the trends he has noticed as the questionnaires pour in.
Sharp says that “probably the most significant factor” in the returns
to date, is a “notable switch to Nixon on the second ballot.”

The poll asks two questions. The first is, “In your opinion, for
which candidate will your state’s delegation cast its vote on the

first ballot?” The second query
switching on the second ballot.

asks for indications of possible

The mock convention questionnaries, which were sent to the
Republican leaders in every state except Arizona and Texas, are
being returned to Lexington as many as 200 a day, and returns from
the Western states, which were sent out first, have reached about

50 per cent.

Sharp, pointing out the usefulness of the poll in insuring the
accuracy of the Mock Convention’s prediction of the next Republican
presidential nominee, says that returns are very high in some states
which are “questionable.” From Iowa, for example, 52 of the 89
chairmen had replied by today; and from Kansas, 54 out of 103

had answered.

Overall returns, said Sharp, have passed 1,400, and the replies
are still coming in. He commented that this is a very favorable
average, in light of the fact that the Gallup Poll in a recent samp-
ling of the county chairmen, received only a 60 per cent return
after asking one easily answered question.

The poll is expected to attract much publicity to the Mock Con-
vention, and much attention from Republican politicians who are
already familiar with the convention.

New James Bond Flick Gets A ‘C’
Story And Acting Called Mediocre

By JAMES JENNINGS

All good movies that have come
or are coming soon have been re-
viewed so I will offer a second-
rate review on a second-rate movie
based on a second-rate novel.

James Bond, the stud with gun-
metal lighter and more broads than
most men can dream about, returns
to the screen in From Russia with
Love. As in all of Ian Fleming's
stories, Bond almost gets killed sev-
eral times, gets outsmarted every
time except the one time that counts,
and gets the girl.

Bond, (Sean Connery, again) goes
to Turkey to make a deal with a
blonde who is passing herself off as
a decoding secretary who has run
away with the top secret decoding
machine. She wants to trade it for
Bond and the super stud is ready
to risk anything for England and
the lady. He deliberately walks into
the trap set up by SPECTRA de-
signed to embarrass England and her
secret service by catching 007 in
an intimate relationship with a Rus-
sian spy (Daniela Bianchi).

Toasted Baloney

From the time James meets the
blonde to the end of the movie the
screen resembles a toasted baloney
sandwich. The music is good, Bond
is tweedy, and the girls are good
looking, but the story and the act-
ing are as mediocre as would be
expected from a mystery story in-
volving a dumb cop knocking heads
with the brains of Russia.

Bond works his way ‘through
gypsy camps, the Turkish under-
ground, and half of the women in

 

Istanbul. He ends up on a slow
train through Europe fighting, drink-
ing and enjoying all the other
studly activities that are publish-
able. As soon as he meets a man he
can really like and respect the guy
gets killed so Bond can stay in love
with himself,

A Modern Clark Kent

The undergraduate has found a
new hero in James Bond. Steve Mc-
Queen has parked his motorcycle
outside Macy’s, Charles Bronson has
gone back to the reservation, but
James Bond is just starting to
move. We drove to Roanoke to see
Dr. No and stayed up late at nights
last summer to get all of the James
Bond novels read. 007 is a stud and
is possibly worthy of some hero
worship, but From Russia with Leve
is pure baloney. While watching
Bond manipulate women and stalk
the enemies of England, one is re-
minded of a mild-mannered Clark
Kent.

The movie is somewhat enjoyable
because Bond is a stud and some
of his lines and actions would be
considered cool. Hugh Heffner says
it is a great improvement over Dr.
No and I guess it is. It stands as
proof you can only do so much
with a second-rate novel. It is not
a bad way to spend two hours on
a rainy afternoon so it gets a C.

Tom Jones comes to the State
tomorrow and has already been re-
viewed so I will not add anything
trite that might be said about a
great and funny movie, except that
it stands as proof of what can be
done with a stud and a first-rate

By LAMAR LAMB

It is always dangerous for a can-
didate to play political analyst. It
is no less dangerous to talk about
trends shown in one election while
another election is in progress. But
I want to discuss some of the trends
which were manifest in the last
election. The Big
Four election is
much __ different
| from class elec-
tions and really
tthe one has very
little to do with
the other, so may-
be it is worth
venturing out on
a limb.

In the first
place, Ken Lane
and Rod Cock-
shutt were right. Both parties con-
ducted a rather meaningless, or at
least issueless campaign. One would
expect that at Washington and Lee
such would almost always be the
case. Our student body is small and
homogenious; there will rarely be
any significant disagreement about
anything in the student govern-
ment,

As both platforms (and, indeed,
all platforms in recent years) point-
ed out, everyone believes in assimi-
lation committees, honor systems,
traditions, and just about anything
else that offends no one. People
who don’t believe in those things are
driven out by their freshman year.
That, or they are forced into a
cynical and desperate withdrawal
from campus life by an oppressive
and omnipotent atmosphere of “sta-
bility” that pervades Washington
and Lee.

In the second place, Drew Baur

Pace Publishes
Party Statement
From Minority

“T hope that in a few paragraphs
I ean elucidate some points that
need clarification. The Progressive
Party understands the position it is
in. Judging from the recent Student
Body elections, it appears that an
unusually large number of votes
were cast without regard to the
merits of the individual candidates.
Because of this many in our party
seriously considered not nominating
a slate of candidates. Many felt
that refusal to do so might help to
make the student body re-examine
the present political situation, and
ultimately to cause a more equitable
political system.

“However, many persons, people
not only in our party but also peo-
ple in the other party and people
without party affiliation, felt that
this would be unfair to too many
deserving students who would re-
ceive no consideration from the other
party. Our minds were not made up,
however, until we saw the Universi-
ty Party clique’s slate, which was, we
felt, filled with weak and unquali-
fied candidates.

“It is our belief that most stu-
dents will be dissatisfied with the
other party’s candidates. It is our
hope that they will express their
disappointment by voting for those
persons better qualified for the
many positions. If, however, the
weaker candidates are elected, the
result can only be slates of simi-
lar quality in the future.

We only ask that the students
carefully study the nominees’ abili-
ty and experience and vote accord-
ingly, with less emphasis on party
affiliation. We would like to com-
mend the University clique’s efforts
to nominate, appease, and maintain a
surface party unity. We question
whether the sacrifices were worth
this effort.”

Earl Mack’s Candidacy

This year has seen more than one
innovation in campus politics, but
perhaps nothing stranger than the
candidacy of “Earl Mack” for sen-
ior class secretary. Actually, as both
cliques have learned to their relief,
there is no such person, despite a
blanket of posters around campus
to the contrary.

“Earl Mack” is in reality an alias
for one of the party candidates, Earl
Madgdovitz. Magdovitz was shorten-
ed Mack on his posters when a lo-
cal printer decided that he was un-
able to print such a long name on a
short piece of paper.

Since Earl Mack will not be nom-
inated by a party there apparently
will be no opportunity to vote for
a real nobody this time. Too bad,
he might have won, as the only can-

 

novel,

didate without any enemies.

too is right. Washington and Lee is
basically a conservative school, sat-
isfied and stable. Perhaps this is
best indicated by the fact that three
of the last four Student Body Pres-
idents have been law students. All
three law students have won by
sizable margins, and that has not
always been attributable to party
majorities. In the last four years, an
undergraduate has never beaten a
law student for President of the
Student Body. The reasons, I sup-
pose, are the predilection for “sta-
bility,” and perhaps a certain desire
for distance and permanancy (father
image, for Freudians).

So what sent the top three
Progressive Party candidates into
a rout like bleating lambs? There
was a big efficient party organi-
zation working against them, They
were unable to form any issues

 

which would cause enough en-
thusiasm to overcome party loyal-
ties. In only one office, that of
President, was it a question of a
liberal vs. a conservative. In fact,
on the whole, the Progressive
Party's candidates (ironically)
were the more conservative,

Then there was the Law School. It
did what it was supposed to do. It
came to the polls; it voted for its
candidate and his slate. The non-
fraternity students weren’t organ-
ized. They split in their own or-
ganization; they split their votes. In
other words, independent students
proved themselves to be just that.

The campaign, then, was char-
acterized by candidates trying hard
to be non-entities. The only issues
were those drummed up by whispers
on both sides, and those issues
were as meaningless as they were

 

 

 

Letters To The Editor ...

 

 

Dear Editor:

The Washington and Lee student
body is a very unusual group, if
we are to believe what we hear
about other colleges. What is so
unusual here is the remarkable po-
litical and social placidity of the
students. The turmoil of the outside
world seems to be well reflected at
most other schools. At Harvard pop-
ular integration societies are raised
and swamp the South with “Free-
dom Riders.” Last year the Prince-
ton student body, apparently smitten
with spring fever, rose as one and
sacked dorms, wrecked automobiles,
fired railroad tracks, and _ battled
with the desperate police. At South
American institutions, attempted as-
sinations of student leaders are not
unknown.

What is being suggested, however,
is not that we turn into junior
demogogues, raze Lexington to the
ground (as tempting as that might
seem), or liquidate Jim Kulp. Rath-
er, one might question the almost
total failure of this student body
to concern itself with anything at
all. Occasionally, an editorial battle
is waged between the two editions
of the Ring-tum Phi, but the ordi-
nary student is seemingly oblivious
to all controversy.

This fact was well demonstrat-
ed in the recent student body
elections in which both parties ran
on platforms of meaningless am-
biguities. Considering the lack of
issues, it is hardly surprising that
there was a strict party vote—with
the predictable results.

This delimma of apathy is cer-
tainly not due to a lack of import-
ant issues at hand. Proposals to in-
tegrate W&L, democratize the E.C.,
eliminate the Assimilation Commit-
tee, and prevent obscene damages
to desks have all been presented
to the students at one time or an-
other. All have fizzled out against

Blames Student Government And Straight Party Voting

the impregnable stone wall of stu-
dent indifference.

What are the reasons for our extra
ordinary inertness? Doubtless, one
is the structure of our student gov-
ernment. As an absolute and semi-
permanent body, the Executive
Committee is under no compunction
to act on any new issues. Indeed,
it is often unaware of their existence.
The trouble here is that the stu-
dents simply lack the machinery to
express their ideas, without a dis-
couraging mass of complications and
effort.

Clique System

Our clique system is also squelch-
ing to new ideas. Understandably,
the cliques try to nominate candi-
dates who will offend no one. These
candidates make further exertions
in that direction. Futhermore, most
students are hesitant to speak out
about touchy issues for fear of
damaging their chances in clique
meeting or of attaching some stigma
to their fraternities.

Finally, is there the possibility
that the students here are just na-
turally different...?

A new set of elections is coming
up soon. Here is another chance
for the candidates to take a chance
and be positive, for once. Here is
also is a chance for minority can-
didates to cut down opponents’
majorities by confronting pleasant
personalities with pertinent issues
(and majority candidates to de-
fend themselves by the same
method.)

Change for the sake of change is
a great evil—but fanatical, unreason-
ing adherence to the status quo is no
less an evil. Let us think about the
issues that have been brought up,
and if they are worthwhile improve-
ments, let us bring them forward
for a vote. Washington and Lee des-
perately needs active, useful, and
meaningful election campaigning.

WARREN MONTGOMERY

 

(Below are statements from EC
candidates for the Progressive Par-
ty, which were announced today
on the front page of this paper.)

Lamar Lamb: “I think that my
experience on the EC is an im-
portant factor in this election. Next
year I will be the only person in
school who will have been on the
EC for two years. It is important to
have a good understanding of what
has been done in previous years.
Only I will be able to provide in-
formation about the EC from earlier
years.”

Rick Carrell: “I believe that each
candidate for Executive Committee
membership should possess the fol-
lowing qualifications; He must be
able to think deeply and be willing
at all times to consider the ideas
of others. He must be readily ac-
cessible to every student and must
diligently seek student opinion. He
must have demonstrated his deter-
mination and leadership through his
scholarship and extracurricular ac-
tivities. Finally, he must always be
willing to accept final responsibili-
ty for his decisions. I feel that I
meet these qualifications and I want
to assume the responsibility of rep-
resenting the rising Senior Class as
Executive Committeeman.”

Chuck Walker: “In returning for
the Executive Committee from the

 

 

Progressive Party Nominees
Issue Campaign Statements

Junior Class, I am interested in
maintaining the structural composi-
tion of the Honor System, in ad-
ministering the spirit rather than
the letter of our Honor Code, in
an increased emphasis on a proper
assimilation program to include both
the traditions of our University, and
orientations of the incoming fresh-
men, and in more effective commun-
ications between the student body
and the Executive Committee.

“Having served on the Executive
Committee for a year, I know that
these programs are capable of ef-
fective implementation and I will,
accordingly, work toward the ac-
complishment of these ends.”

Fred Mindel: “My whole campaign
is based on myself as an individual.
I am attempting to see very mem-
ber of the rising junior class in
order that he might get to know me
as an individual and decide his vote
on that basis alone. This is defi-
nitely not an election where any
other factor should be taken into
consideration.”

Kirk Folle: “It is my utmost de-
sire to serve the sophomore class
as Executive Committeeman. In or-
der to represent the class effectively
I will attempt to see as many stu-
dents as possible and will consider
all suggestions relevant to the work
of the EC.”

 

Shortage Of Campaign Issues Is Reflection
Of Students’ Conservatism, Self-Satisfaction

false.

Perhaps the most significant
thing about the election was
something that it symbolically

pointed out. There was not one
candidate for the Big Four who
was an SAE, Beta, Phi Delt, KA,
or ZBT. Both candidates for Pres-
ident were nonfraternity men.

The trend, long recognized as
coming, finally reached its culmina-
tion. No longer will a few houses
control the campus, if, indeed, they
ever did, And, rightly or wrongly,
nonfraternity men and law students
will have to be considered from now
on when candidates are chosen.

So Washington and Lee chose its
student leadership. It is assured that
W&L will continue much as it has
before. Perhaps because the student
is basically sound, perhaps because
the students (including the candi-
dates) resist change, Washington and
Lee will be roughly the same next
year,

And because there will be no
change, next year’s candidates will
deplore the isolation of the EC, will
suggest Mock Honor trials, will
favor the Assimilation Committee
with possible changes in the imple-
mentation of the rules, and will act
as if it will make all the difference
in the world whether or not they
are elected.

 

Reform Party
Runs Two Men

Entering campus politics for the
second time this year, the Reform
Party, has nominated two candi-
dates for office in the upeoming
election,

Roger Sennott, an Independent, is
running for the junior EC post and
Roper Vaughan, a Phi Delt, has been
placed in the running for the Sec-
retary of the sophomore class.

The purpose of the Reform Par-
ty is to place in office individuals
who are best qualified to handle
the duties of the post. These candi-
dates are chosen on the basis of
their ability and not according to
fraternity or party affiliation. Al-
though this is only the beginning
of the movement, it is hoped that
through its ability to nominate the
best candidates, and not the most
politically advantageous, it will
eventually force the downfall of the
present clique system.

New Coach Will

Teach Tennis

Former Groveton Mentor
Called, by Twardy, Tough

By TOM CARPENTER
Tuesday Sports Writer

The Washington and Lee basket-
ball team is the proud possessor of
a new coach. He is Verne Canfield,
the 3l-year-old coach of Grove-
ton High School in Fairfax, Vir-
ginia. The announcement of his ap-
pointment was made Saturday by
the W&L Athletic Department.

Canfield replaces Bob McHenry,
who is moving to Lebanon Valley.
Canfield will also assume the posi-
tion of coach of the tennis team.

Jeff Twardy, one of two freshmen
to make the W&L varsity basketball
team ‘this season, played against
Canfield’s team for three years when
Twardy attended Annandale High
School, an arch rival of Groveton’s
in the tough Northern Virginia
League. Twardy had nothing but
compliments for the new coach.

Players’ Feelings

“In my three years of varsity ball
at Annadale we never beat Grove-
ton,” commented Twardy. “We had
better teams, but the Tigers always
beat us.” Twardy said that he was
impressed by Canfield’s ability to
get his team up for each game.
Also his team always seemed well
drilled and ran good patterns ac-
cording to Twardy.

Canfield never had a losing sea-
son at Groveton and always won
at least ten games. He stresses speed
and will provide his men _ with
plenty of running in order to get
them in condition. In high school
he generally used a man-to-man de-
fense, was willing to switch to a
match-up zone when tthe situation
called for it.

Canfield was also the coach this
season of one of the hottest college
prospects in the country in the per-
son of Jimmy Lewis, who recently
became the first Negro to accept
a basketball scholarship at West
Virginia .

It is likely that with Canfield asf

coach the Generals’ fans will see
a new style of basketball in Lex-
ington. The Generals will probably

be a running ‘team as opposed to},

recent years of slowdown tactics.

Thursday to oppose the W&L stick-
men, and the following Wednesday

Substituting three entirely new
players into its starting six, the
Washington and Lee tennis team
still managed to walk away with
Bridgewater, 9-0, Friday for its

tenth victory in twelve starts.
Drew Baur, Fred Taussig and Bill
Washburn, Jr., augmented the reg-
lar General courtsters and proved
their capabilities by easily handling
their Eagle opponents. Jim DeYoung,
Jim Mell and Lindsey Short, all
regular General tennis starters, had

Golfers Finish
Third In State

Battling the weather as well as
all of the top golf teams in the
state, Washington and Lee’s links-
ters faired rather well yesterday as
they waded to a third place tie
in the Virginia Intercollegiate Tour-
nament held this weekend at the
Homestead.

Ed Crosland found the wet course
to his liking and responded with
a torrid 158 for two rounds (84 and
74) to capture overall individual
second place for the Generals. Cros-
land was right behind the medalist
from VPI George Cochran who shot
the leading score of 155 (75 and
80).

Virginia Tech took home the
team first place edging the Univer-
sity of Virginia by ten points with
a total score of 650. W&L and
Lynchburg tied for third place, both
shooting a team total of 670. The
Generals were fairly pleased with
their showing on the soggy course,
but are now in the process of get-
ting “Teed up” for the CAC tourney

more important, boost their morale
prior to the CAC tournament.
W&L has begun to collect more
hits as the rise in the team batting
average from .172 for just after the
Spring Vacation trip to .205 now in-
dicates. Dave Kirkpatrick with a
223 batting average, Ashley Allen
with .300 and co-captain Lou Flana-
gan with .300 lead the Generals’ at-
tack.

However, Washington and Lee con-

tinues to commit errors at the same
rate as they did early in the season.
Most of these errors are now of the
throwing variety; the fielding mis-
takes account for very few. Main-
ly the errors continue to come in
the early innings.
In the pitching department, the
problem is issuing a free pass to
the first batter in many innings
who has eventually scored 95 per
cent of the time. However, co-
captain Brice Gamber, southpaw
Chris Wigert and rightie Pete Heu-
manns are sound physically and
need only some good fielding sup-
port and a little batting to give them
the confidence a pitcher needs to be
effective.

New Trends

In California

Forecast Victory To Rocky

Washington and Lee’s Mock Re-|
publican Convention is predicting
that Nelson Rockfeller will upset
Senator Barry Goldwater in the
California primary.

Rocky Gets Votes

The GOP Chairman for California
announced today that he will cast
his state’s 86 votes for Rockefeller
in the W&L Convention on May 4.
His decision, (made after intensive
study of the Rocky-Goldwater fight
in California), is based on the be-
lief that the New York governor
will come from behind and defeat

 

Goldwater; thus insuring Rockefeller |
California’s block of 86 votes on at!
least the first two ballots.

The California chairman, senior |
Jim Sylvester, analyzed every poll |
taken in California in the last|
few months. He received advice and
campaign details from both Gold-
water and Rockefeller campaign
headquarters in Washington and!
California. |

Rocky On Rise

Sylvester admits that if the pri-
mary were held this week, Gold-
wate would win comfortably. But
he lists four factors which he thinks
will enable Rockefeller to pull away
from the Arizonian during the next
month. The first prediction is that
Rockefeller will do unexpectedly
well in the Oregon primary on May
15, and that his campaign will take
on new energy thereafter.

The second factor favoring Rocke-
feller is that more voters than usual
will turn out for this primary, be-
cause of the frenzied activity of both
camps. A large turnout will benefit
Rockefeller because Goldwater’s
strength is in a “hard core” of dedi-
cated Republicans who are not like-

 

Mock Pmuentinn Schedule

ly to increase in numbers any more
than they already have. Rockefeller,
though, expects to attract much ad-
ditional support in his thorough
criss-crossing the state.
Lodge Is Favorite

Third, says Sylvester, Rockefeller
will begin to attract the active sup-
port of those whose first choice
is Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge,
the most popular candidate in Cal-
ifornia. Lodge’s moderate following
will vote very heavily for Rocke-

Dr. Baumann
Discusses Ideas

Of C. G. Jung
By SAM McCHESNEY

Analytic psychiatrist Dr. Dieter
Baumann spoke on “An Example of
Dream Interpretation” in duPont
Auditorium last Wednesday night.

Dr. Baumann opened his lecture
with a discussion of C. G. Jung’s
theories. Dr. Jung stated that there
were two parts to the psychic, the
ego and the unconscious. He stated
that ego dealt with the central point
of reference, whereas the uncon-
scious was manifested in intangible
forms such as dreams.

Dr. Baumann followed this with
the problem of interpreting a dream.
Baumann stated that when a dream
was interpreted the patient felt a
sense of relief. The patient actually
became more alive. This is caused
by the release of energy stored in
the unconscious to the conscious.

Dream Interpretation

In trying to interpret a dream,
Baumann followed a_ general
pattern. First, he asks the patient
what has happened to him recent-
ly. In this way Dr. Baumann can
see what the patient feels and from
that discover what the dream refers
to. Sometimes he has his patient
write out his dream since it gives
the patient “a dedication of atten-
tion to the dream.”

After attempting to find out what
the patient feels, Dr. Baumann pro-
ceeds to ask the patient what comes
to his mind when a segment of the
dream is recalled. With this informa-
tion in mind Dr. Baumann attempts
an interpretation. In order to in-
terpret the dream satisfactorily, Dr.
Baumann states that an agreement
must exist between the patient and
the interpretor.

Two Hindrances

Dr. Baumann states that two fac-
tors can hinder the interpretor’s
understanding of the dream. First,
the analyst and the patient might
have the same problem. Also, the
interpretor can lack knowledge to
interpret certain symbols. In this
case he has to check a general file
of symbol interpretations and in this
way find the answer to the problem.

Dr. Baumann then referred the
audience to a dream of a 33-year-
old woman. This lady, who lived in
an apartment, dreamed that she
heard a moan from her guest room.
She walked near the guest room
bookcase and felt the floor move, as
if she were standing on someone.
She left the room, and her dog
came into the guest room and began
tearing up the floor. In so doing
the dog uncovered a body. The dead
body great stench. At
this time the dreamer was awaken
by her alarm clock.

Dr. Baumann had to this
problem. Following the procedure
before, he discover that the patient
had always had trouble solving al-

* Roger Sennott, Reform Party candi-

date, showed unexpected support
getting 39 votes. Dave Marchese, a
Phi Gam, won the presidency over
Sigma Chi Scott Kennedy, 135-108.
Phi Psi Bob Lee won the VP spot
while Yancey, a Beta, and Joe
Framptom, A PiKA, won the secre-

 

tary and historian’s posts respective-
ly.

 

Sophomore Class

In the rising Sophomore Class
Bryant Kendrick, a Phi Delt won the
EC post over Kirk Follo, an SAE,
142-115. Bill Jeffress, a Delt, polled
more votes than any other candidate
defeating ZBT Stuart Finestone, 150-
104. Barry Vaught, a KA took the
Vice President's spot over Chuck
Staples. Reform candidate Roper
Vaughan pulled the surprise of the
night when he coped the secretary
spot. Vaughan is a Phi Delt. Ken
Greene, a ZBT, edged Lambda Chi
Skip Brooks for the historian post.

“I believe we did have the best
candidates,” said Progressive Party
chairman Tom Pace. “Apparently the
student body agreed. That we were
pleased is undoubtedly true, how-
ever, we were also disappointed in
several cases. We believe the student
body is now more interested in
electing the best candidates than
playing the game of party politics.
We can only hope that best men
were elected.”

The Progressive Party seemed to
vote straight tickets while pulling
votes from the UP in the upper class
elections.

John Larry Manning, Jr., a Beta |

Wednesday. Manning’s three Assist- |
ant Head Dormitory Counselors are |
to be: Daniel L. Manson from Mar-|

Henry B. Quekemeyer, a Delt jun-|
ior from Roanoke; and Stephen P.|
Smith, a Sigma Nu from Jackson-|
ville, Florida.

Re-appointed Counselors

The Dean’s Office also announced |
the reappointment of 6 of this year’s |
counselors, 17 new appointees, and}

10 alternates. The reappointed coun-|
selors are: Joel E. Brown, SAE}

junior from Memphis, Tennessee; F.
William Burke, Beta senior from!
Washington, D.C.; Shannon Jung,

a junior from Alexandria, Louisiana;
F, Lamar Lamb, a junior from Ros-
well, New Mexico; Lewis B. Mc-
Neace, Jr., Phi Kap senior from
Roanoke; and J. Malcolm Morris,
SPE junior from Richmond, Virginia
New Counselors

The newly appointed counselors

for the freshmen dorms are: William

D. Andrews, Delt sophomore from

| Herbert F.

Salem, Virginia; Thomas T. Cren-
shaw, III, Delt junior from Water-
town, N. Y.; Joseph H. Framptom,

Alternates

In case one of the appointed

Dorm Counselors is unable to serve
in this capacity next year, the va-
eaney will be filled from among this
group of alternates: John L. Baber,
Ill, Earl T. Berry, James G. Buck-
ey, S. Birnie Harper, Thornton M.
Henry, Allan F. Hubbard, John C.
Moore, Consider W. Ross, E. Starke
Sydnor, and Robert C. Vaughan.

 

we were somewhat disappointed,
however, we believe the results re-
flected popularity more than any-
thing else. We feel that it is the
job of our party to nominate can-
didates for class offices rather than
force a straight ticket vote on our
members.”

Jere Turner and Bob Pless were
elected Wednesday night to repre-
sent the Intermediate and Senior
Law students respectively.

Qualifications

Carrell, who is an SAE from
Pensacola, Florida, is on the Dean’s
List, the Student Service Society,
and SWMSFC. This year he was
the Circulation Manager of the
Ring-tum Phi, and next year will
serve as Business Manager. During
this year he served as chairman of
the Liberty Hall Committee and as
a fraternity officer.

Geer, who is a Phi Delt from
Spartanburg, South Carolina, is
treasurer of SWMSFC and his fra-
ternity. He also played an active
part in the Student Service So-
ciety. He is a member of the “13”
Club, a varsity swimmer and was
elected this week as a dormitory
counselor for next year.

Mindel, who is a ZBT, from Tole-
do, has been active in varsity
basketball, the Student Service So-
ciety, the Liberty Hall Society,
the Calyx and Ring-tum Phi. He is
a fraternity officer and is on the
Dean’s List.

Walker, who is a Kappa Sig from
San Antonio, will be returning for
his second year on the EC. He is
on the Honor Roll and Dean’s List,
SWMFC, the Liberty Hall Society,
Shenandoah Business Staff, Dance
Board Advisory Committee. He was
chosen the IFC Outstanding Fresh-
man in 1963 and is a fraternity of-
ficer.

Kendrick, who is a Phi Delt from
Greenville, South Carolina, is the
captain of both the freshman foot-
ball and lacrosse teams. This year he
has been in the UCA, and served as
the freshman representative to the
Assimilation Committee.

 

Reform Party
Wins Position

The newly organized Reform Par-
ty succeeded in the election of its
candidate for secretary of the Soph-
omore Class. Roper Vaughan, Phi
Delt was elected by a wide margin
after being nominated by Bill Bab-
cock, an SAE freshman, in a
denunciation of “big clique” nom-
inating and manipulation.

Vaughan Kidnapped

It was said that the party leaders
had exerted pressure on Vaughan to
withdraw from the race; the Reform
Party backers, however, determined
not to see their efforts thwarted,
kidnapped their candidate so that
he was not able to decline his nom-
ination at the class assembly. Upon
his release, Vaughan pointed out
that his intention to withdraw from
the race did not indicate his un-
willingness to serve in the office
of secretary but merely his obli-
gation to his fraternity, which had
been erroneously blamed for his
candidacy.

Reform Policy

In his speech, Babcock lashed out
at “straight party” voting, suggest-
ing that voting should be for the
best man in the best interest of the
school, rather than in the interest
of fraternities. He challenged the as-
sembled voters to accept the Re-
form Party’s platform by electing
their candidate, and declared that if
the Reform Party were successful,
it would hold open primaries in the
elections of next year.

This year’s Reform Party is un-
affiliated with any reform move-
ments of previous years. It is an ef-
fort to start a process of evolution
which would end, it is hoped, in
a more democratic campus political
system.

A Needed Improvement

By its assent to the new Rush Week proposal last Monday,

the Interfraternity Council offered further testimony of that
Body’s resurrection this year.

The traditional system for Rush Week has been a constant
sore spot with the IFC for many years. Three of the prover-
bial criticisms have been the stampedes into the domitories,
the traffic problem, and the freshmen’s immediate and over-
whelming exposure to a drinking atmosphere. Although in
previous years committees had been set up by the IFC in an
attempt to resolve these problems, no alternative plan was
drafted that could be found equitable by all the houses.

That such a plan has at last been realized, as is the case
if and when it receives a second three-fourths majority vote
next Monday, could only be the result of concentrated work
and patient deliberation on the part of this year’s Rush Com-
mittee. On paper, the proposal is very cogent and if backed
by strong leadership, it may provide W&L with its first non-
devastating Rush Week next fall. We wish the IFC, and in
particular next year’s rush chairmen, the best of luck in put-

An Educational Experience

The second page is dedicated to providing an in-
sight into the prospects of the six major Republican
candidates. Each candidate has been reviewed by his or
her respective campaign manager.

This weekend will probably be the most enjoyable and edu-
cational one we will spend in four years at W&L. Everything
points to the creation of an excitement that is generally felt
only at the national conventions.

The political eyes of the United States will be directed
towards Washington and Lee’s famed Mock Convention as an
indication of what will happen in July at the San Francisco
Republican Convention.

By BILL BURKE

Senator Barry Goldwater and his
policies and proposals have been
widely discussed throughout the
nation for some time. He has always
been willing to discuss the issues in
a free and straightforward manner,
and this quality has been immensely
refreshing in American politics; poli-
tics that are usually marked with
deception and platitudes.

Civil Rights
He has always made a sharp dis-
tinction between the civil rights that
are guaranteed under the Constitu-

 

tion and the rights of association
which are basically moral issues and
cannot be solved by passing un-
enforceable federal laws. There-
fore he feels that the proposed pub-
lic accommodations section is an
example where the new laws will
only hinder and not help the cause
of racial tolerance.

On foreign aid Goldwater has
said that he was “opposed to for-
eign economic aid as it is pres-
ently conceived and administer-
ed” but he supports “military and
technical assistance; the former to

 

protect our friends against Com-
munist aggression and the latter
to help nations help themselves.”
He would encourage less inter-
ference and more results in our
foreign aid program and “less
money better spent.”

Goldwater is for a free world
market in international trade and
has said that “expanding interna-
tional trade is most important to the
well being of the people of the
Usa

Senator Goldwater has repeatedly
stated that the right to strike “con-

It is because of its unique position as a replica of the na-
tional convention and its accuracy in the past that the Mock
Convention is receiving much nation-wide emphasis. This
emphasis will, of course, extend to the Washington and Lee

student body because of the very nature of the Convention.

From the very beginning, Gov-
ernor Nelson A. Rockefeller has
been an announced candidate. This
has had both its advantages and
disadvantages. With the progression
of any campaign, people are con-
stantly going to find points of con-
tention to use against the candidate.
But Rockefeller has remained rela-
tively free of these slander-seekers,
though it is well seen that he has not

is: Will Rockefeller get the nomi-
nation both here at W&L and again
in July? It is my firm belief that
he will. The following are some of
the reasons why Governor Rocke-
feller should be the GOP’s choice.

First, we must remember that we
are looking for a candidate who can
beat Johnson next fall. This man
is Rockefeller, for with him we
would not run the risk of extremism,
which we certainly cannot afford to
toy with in these days, nor would

Nixon As

By JACK YARBROUGH

In a survey conducted by the As-
sociated Press which started on
April 1, correspondents in the 50
states and District of Columbia
questioned more than 3000 county
chairman, vice chairmen, town lead-
ers, and other party leaders as
to who they thought would get the
Republican nomination this summer.
This survey indicated that Richard
Nixon would get the nomination
and be the national standard bearer
for the Republicans in 1964.

sponsibility and unquestioned un-
derstanding of both foreign and do-
mestice affairs.

An important point that should
be made is what exactly it takes
to get elected, besides the man him-
self. It is time to face the cold hard
facts realistically. Money and or-
ganization are the two keys to a
successful campaign. Rockefeller has
both.

The Republican Party realizes the
tremendous odds they are up against
in this coming election, and they
are looking for a candidate who
has both the funds and the organiza-
tion to wage an all out battle.
Rockefeller is the only man who
could successfully do this. Just re-
flect on what gave the late President
Kennedy the victory: his resoruces
and organization.

Stabilization

Along with these two criteria, the
party is looking for a man who will
stabilize the party. This can only be
done by selecting a candidate who
will be able to battle Johnson to the
end. Rockefeller can and will rally
the support of the party. He is also
the most likely candidate to pick
up support from the other party.

next Tuesday.

One other thing should be pointed
out here. There are several states
that will give their delegates to
favorite sons. Included among these
are Kentucky, Wisconsin, Ohio, and
Minnesota. If Nixon could pick up
some of these delegates on the sec-
ond ballot, and make a good show-
ing, his chances will be very good.

support,
Nixon will be around to pick up

Thus far only Goldwater and Nix-
have been mentioned as contenders
for the nomination. It would be a
to overlook Rockefeller,
Scranton, and Lodge. Both Scranton
and Lodge—despite the fact that
they, like Nixon, have not campaign-
ed in any primary election nor said
they are candidates for the nomina-
tion—received many more votes in
they re-
in October and December.
Rockefeller, who is campaigning for
the nomination ran last in October

out of the White House is through
a completely unified party effort. He
feels that the only way the Re-
publicans can gain this unity is
through the draft of a candidate ac-
ceptable to all.

For some reason or another, all
the other possible candidates are
not acceptable to the party as a unit,
either due to issues that they are
for or against, past records, or per-
sonal problems. Many of Scranton’s
backers feel that he can supply the
Republican Party with the unity
that they need so badly. He is an
intelligent, attractive candidate. His
record as the Governor of Pennsyl-
vania has been almost beyond re-
proach, His family heritage is root-

 

ed deep in Republican Party loy-

alty. He has attacked no candidate
to date, nor has he been directly at-
tacked by any other candidate. His
record is spotless, unblemished.
Drafted Twice

For these reasons, I myself, as well
as many other Republican leaders,
feel that Governor Seranton would,
and possibly will be, the best can-
didate that the GOP could put up
in 1964, A few other facts will speak
well for the Governor. He has twice
before been drafted by the Republi-
can Party—once to run for Con-
gress in his home district, and once
to run for the Governorship of Penn-
sylvania. Both times he was run-
ning against heavy odds, for the
Republican Party started at a great
disadvantage vote-wise. Both times
he realized that the only chance the
Party had was to unify and support
one candidate, and both times he
was the man.

After being drafted, he did the
rest. Scranton is a politician’s poli-
tician. He is smart, shrewd, and
his sense of timing is amazing. The
latter is probably his biggest asset.
He wins elections on the campaign
trail, and although not many people
are familiar with him, Scranton
would make himself known to the
whole population of the U.S. in a

(Continued on page 4)

this coming July will have to be
known, both nationally and interna-
tionally. This is prerequisite and
Governor Scranton does not have
this. This along with his firm con-
viction not to run would rule him
out as a candidate for serious con-
sideration.

Mr. Lodge has shown support in
some small states, but this seems
more of a popularity vote than a
vote for a man who can do the job.
His job at present, as he calls it,
is as a servant of the people in Viet
Niem. It is doubtful that the sup-
port he will receive will be enough
of an impetus to bring him back
to the states.

Maine Senator-
GOP Surprise?

By GEORGE CRADDOCK

Senator Margaret Chase Smith is
waging an active and austere cam-
paign for the presidential nomina-
tion at the Republican Mock Con-
vention to be held here on May
4 and 5. This campaign is being run
without the aid of large financial
resources or the help of powerful
political organizations; rather em-
phasis is being placed on experi-
ence, on principles, and a sober and
direct approach. We believe that
the political convictions of the Sen-
ator are those held by the majority
of the people and the convention
delegates.

Senior Senator

Sen. Smith is the Senior Senator
from Maine, having served in the
highest legislative body since 1949
and congress since 1940. Significant-
ly, she has more national office ex-
perience than any other of the
announced or unannounced candi-
dates for the presidential nomina-
tion. She has termed herself a po-
litical moderate, looking neither to
the extremes of the right or left as
the future course for this country.
This middle of the road stand offers
the people a greater opportunity for
choice than either of the leading
candidates from the extreme ends of
the political picture can possibly of-
fer. Mrs. Smith has proven herself
to be a diligent, active, and success-
ful campaigner as seen in her sur-
prising show of strength in the IIli-
nois primary several weeks ago.

Surprises?

National Conventions are popu-
lar and famous for their surprises,
and no individual here is certain
of its outcome. One thing is cer-
tain, however, that the “Lady
from Maine” will be represented
here as a strong and able candi-
date, The Republican dark horse in
1964, therefore, may well prove to
be a filly,

stitutes a basic civil liberty.” He
sees this right as a corollary to the
right to bargain collectively. But his
position on labor-management is
conditioned by his concern for the
trade union member and his rights—
as opposed to those of the labor
bureaucracy.
Stand on Cuba

He fully supported the 1962 block-
ade against Cuba during the missile
crisis. Ever since then he has chal-
lenged the administration to con-
tinue the strong action that would
eliminate the Communist military
and subversion base just 90 miles
off our coast. He has charged, with-
out challenge, that the administra-
tion has failed to enforce restric-
tiens on shipping to Cuba.

Goldwater’s Prospects
Reports from state and national
Republican leaders show the con-
vention’s leaders that Goldwater
now has more votes than any other
GOP presidential hopeful, but no-
body knows if his lead is strong
enough to pull in the undecided
delegations.

Looking at the overall picture,
Durette, the Steering Committee’s
Republican Party Chairman, says he
thinks Goldwater “will have up-
wards of 400 votes on the first bal-
lott” at the Mock Convention.
Barry Goldwater stands for a
strong, solid fiscal policy and a
continually growing America—an
America under freedom and the
basic individual rights of each and
every American citizen. He is cer-
tainly no “extremist,” and he cer-
tainly can win in 1964—he is, in fact,
the only candidate that will offer
the American voter a choice.

Barry Goldwater not only can
win, but he will win. Because of
these reasons, and many others,
and, irregardless of California,
Barry Goldwater will win the
nomination of the Washington and
Lee Mock Convention for Presi-
dent on the second ballot.

 

Popular Support

In Primaries

Is Lodge Asset

By WALT BENNETT

In considering the candidacy of
Henry Cabot Lodge for the Re-
publican nomination for President
of the United States, there are sev-
eral things to bear in mind. First,
Mr. Lodge has proven his popular-
ity time after time in various pri-
maries without stating himself that
he is an official candidate for the
nomination. In the primaries in
which he has participated it has
been on a write-in basis and he has
still managed to receive a most im-
pressive showing. The foremost ex-
ample of this is of course his im-
pressive victory in New Hampshire
over other officially declared candi-
dates.

A second thing to consider in Mr.
Lodge's candidacy is the fact that
he has become a strong contender
for the nomination without an elab-
orate organization working for him.
This is adequate indication that
Mr. Lodge has the support of the
people themselves since the people
have largely taken the initiative
in his behalf. Mr. Lodge’s support
was not created by an organization
working on his behalf but comes
from a strong and widely spread
popularity among the voters them-
selves, the people,

A third factor in Mr. Lodge’s be-
half is that a good deal of his pop-
ularity comes from parts of the
country which are quite a distance
from his native New England. He
is not a sectional candidate. This
will undoubtedly be evidenced by
his almost certain victory in the
coming Oregon primary where Mr.
Lodge will again be a write-in can-
didate. In recent polls Mr. Lodge
has also shown strength in the Mid-
West and South, areas which until
recently had been considered almost
solidly for Senator Goldwater. Mr.
Lodge made a quite significant
showing in the primary in Mr.
Seranton’s home state, Pennsylvania.
Recent polls have also indicated
generally that Mr. Lodge is being
considered more and more seriously
by a rapidly increasing number of
people. His popularity as a candidate
has certainly increased more than
any other candidate while, indeed,
the popularity of some of them has
markedly declined.

It is for these reasons as well as
Mr. Lodge’s outstanding record of
service to his country that he must
be considered as a strong and like-
ly candidate for the Republican
nomination for President of the
United States. I urge you to weigh
these matters carefully and to sup-
port the best man, Henry Cabot
Lodge, for the Republican nomina-
tion,

 

 

 
 

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Stickmen to Face Toughest Yet;
Jayvees Outclassed by Virginia

By BRUCE GARRETT

The best W&L lacrosse team in
many a year faces a little bit better
team tomorrow.

Washington College of Maryland
is, according to W&L defense coach
Dana Swan, “head and _ shoulders
the best team we will have played
to date, including Williams.” Game
time is 3:15 on Wilson Field.

The Marylanders, who defeated
W&L last year 10-3, bring a 6-2
record into tomorrow’s game. Their
only loses to date have been to
Navy, 13-4, and to Johns Hopkins,
16-6. They have defeated UNC, 17-5,
New Hampshire, 22-4, Loyola, 15-2,
Hofstra, 8-6 (in the mud), Towson,
26-2, and Swarthmore, 15-4.

Last year Washington College was
ranked No. 13 in the country. W&L
was No. 38. Both teams have im-
proved their ratings this year.

country. He can, and does, play be-
hind the goal, on the creases, and
in the midfield.

Their midfielders, Dick, Rudolph,
and Weiss, who scored four goals
against W&L last year, are
a solid corps; and the Marylanders
are three deep at all positions.

The Washington defense is strong
and quick, and composed of good
stickhandlers. All the defensemen
can go either right or left with
the sick. Goalie Johnson can be
either fair or great depending on
the occasion. Against Navy he made
27 saves.

This will be Washington and Lee’s
first actual meeting with a fellow
member of the Southern (Strobahr)
Division, although North Carolina
and Duke are affiliated. Towson and
Loyola, whom we have yet to play,
are the other members of the league.

 

 

As the result of softball action
through Wednesday of this week,
two playoff positions have apparent-
ly been decided, while the races in
the other two leagues are still up
for grabs. All but certain of play-
off spots are Delt (4-0) and ZBT
(3-0.) Engaged in a three-way bat-
tle for one other playoff spot are
SPE (3-1), Beta (2-1), and Phi
Gam (2-1). Fighting for the last po-
sition are PiKA (3-0) and DU (2-0).

By virtue of two big victories in
the last week, the Delts took their
league’s title. First they whipped
Sigma Chi, 9-4, and then they de-
feated Lambda Chi, 5-0 behind the
shutout pitching of Fred Schaeffer.

It is the second setback for the
W&L freshmen in three starts.

The complete mixup which result-
ed in a three-way battle for third
place in the third league came about
when it was discovered that SPE
used an inelligible player in their
victory over Phi Gam. As a result,

the game was awarded to Phi Gam
on a forfeit. This left three teams
with a chance for first place...
SPE, Phi Gam, and Beta, who gained
a chance for the top spot with their
9-7 victory over Phi Delt. The cham-
pionship will be settled when SPE
meets the winner of yesterday’s
Phi Gam-Beta contest. SPE, who
earlier in the week downed Phi Delt,
21-2, rates as the probable favorite.

The mess in the four league de-
veloped when PiKA won_ two
straight in the last week to keep
a perfect record while DU didn’t
play. They first downed Pi Phi, 6-5,
and then they beat SAE by a forfeit.
DU was rained out in their only
game this week, against SAE. The
league’s championship will probably
be decided when DU and PiKA meet
in their already once postponed
game.

The week’s only other games saw
Sigma Chi pick up its second win
of the season, by forfeit, over Phi
Psi, and SAE take a forfeit victory

(Continued on page 4)

 

The game was close for a quarter.
The score at the end of the first
period was 1-1, but the Cavaliers
broke it wide open in the second
quarter with four goals.

The game’s leading scorer was
Billy Harrison of Virginia. He had
three goals. Cavalier goalie Stu
Orrick was also outstanding and
was credited with sixteen saves.

Fred Skinner got the only W&L
goals. Generals goalie Skip Brooks
made ten saves.

The varsity tennis team met de-

Washington, on Tuesday. Jim Mell
was the only victor for the Generals
in singles play, and he won in a
close hard fought three-set match.
Mell was also instrumental in gain-
ing the other win for W&L as he
and Forrest Dickinson combined
to win at number three doubles.

Jim DeYoung and Forrest Dickin-

W&L Takes
Dual Meet

The Washington and Lee track
team ran, swam and wallowed its
way to dual meet victories over
Elon (108-37) and High Point (99'2-
4514) in a triangular meet Tuesday.

The meet, scored as two dual
team’s game with RPI has been
for the season to 6-1. The triangu-
lar score was W&L 100%, High
Point 53, and Elon 26}.

In spite of rather unfavorable
conditions—the track was three inces
under water in places— the Generals
won 11 of the 17 events en route
to their largest point total of the
season. Several Generals ran “un-
officially” and would have added to
the total had they been official.

With the dual meet season com-
pleted, the trackmen have only the
state meet at Charlottesville and the
College Athletic Conference meet in
Danville, Ky., remaining on the
schedule.

Double winners for the victors
were Mike Goode who took the
high hurdles in 17.3, and the lows
in 27.8, Robin Kell who won the
high jump at 5’ 6” and the broad
jump at 21’ 34”, and Chris Kell
who won the 100 in 10.7, and the
220 in 23.3.

Other individual winners for the
Generals were Gay Gasque in the
shot, 45’ 8%”; Johnny Graham in
the pole vault, 11’ 6”; Scott Kennedy
in the javelin, 159’ 4”; and Rick
Hartgrove in the triple jump, 40’ 5”.
The 440 relay team was also vic-
trious in the time of 46.2.

Forty-seven men, a full varsity
and freshman team, will make the
trip to Charlottesville tomorrow for
the state meet. Coach Norm Lord
has high hopes of improving last
year’s fourth place finish.

You see it on the windows of
cars many times a day—three little
animals grouped in a festive mood.
They’re knokn as “Minks,” a nick-
name given to W&L students.

Century-old records referring
to us as “Minks” have been un-
covered, but no one is really sure
where this distinctive title origi-
nated.

One theory—after the notorious
“rat” of VMI became established as
the “most dispicable form of life
known to man,” it logically followed
that those on the adjoining campus

very short period of time. He is a
hard worker, and his past record
proves this.

Honest Assessment

As for an honest assessment of
the W&L Mock Convention, I am
not sure of his chances. I have
polled every state chairman, and it
appears to be a battle between
Nixon and Scranton on the later
(fourth, fifth, sixth) ballots. I would
have to give Nixon a slight edge.
I am confident, however, that he
will make a good showing at the
National convention in July. Scran-
ton movements are springing up all
over the country, and his backers
expect to send this drive into a high
gear in the next few weeks.

They are honestly working for a
draft now, and as has happened
twice before, I would not be the
least bit surprised if they do get
the draft for him. The convention’s
biggest disadvantage at this point
is that of being held at a date be-
fore the Scranton forces start to
really move. Of course the later date
of the California primary could also
be a crucial factor.

In summary, I feel that Scran-
ton’s chances at W&L are not quite
as good as I would like them to
be. I feel that he is a_ serious
candidate, and people should treat
him as such. I think also by July
that the draft will develop, and
that William Scranton will be
running against Johnson for the
Presidency.

and lost ground in the December
and April polls.

It is two full months until the
convention in San Francisco and
any thing can happen, but con-
sidering how things sound now
it seems to be a contest between
Goldwater and Nixon and if Gold-
water doesn’t win early, it looks
like Nixon is to run against John-
son next fall.

gebra and geometry problems. This
failure made her doubt her own
abilities and life in general.

In analyzing the dream part by
part, Dr. Baumann discovered that.
the patient was an introvert since |
her dream took place in her apart-
ment. An introvert was most at home
with herself, he explained.

When she walked over the moan-
ing body under the floor, she had to
leave the room because of her fear.
Dr. Bauman stated that the probing
dog represents the curiosity of the
patient since a person feels an in-
stinetive identification to a dog.

In solving the problem Dr. Bau-
mann stated that the patient re-
sisted the mathematical idea that
“a” equals “b.” She believed that
“a” could only equal “a” since “b”
was not the same as “a.” She tried
to force herself to understand these
identides that she did not under-
stand., and in the process she began
to doubt herself and life in general.
When the patient was told the rea-
son for her bad dream, she felt
much relieved.

servative Goldwater.

Finally, the Mock Convention of-
ficials point out that Goldwater's
plan to stay out of California dur-
ing the campaign, will prevent his
stopping these trends toward Rocke-
feller. If Goldwater does come to
California, Rockefeller will try to tie
the conservatives to his extremist
supporters in the state.

The Mock Convention’s prediction
that Rockefeller will stop Gold-
water in California is not the first
limb on which the Washington and
Lee students have dared to perch.
But they have been right eight out

tual nominee for the party out of

To prove themselves above the

lowly title of “rats,” the W&L stu-
dents took the name of “Minks”
in the belief that the mink is the
aristocratic blue-blood of the ro-
dent family.
However, some VMI people came
up with another theory several years
ago. They claimed the mink is a
slippery, scheming creature which,
apparently harmless by day, stealth-
ily stalks its prey by night, at least
during midnight maneuvers on VMI
dance weekends.
Hence, they felt the title appro-
priately bestowed on those nasty
men who constantly “cherchez les

For Nixon, his only hope is

has a fantastically faithful follow-
ing in some states. Quality is all
very fine, but again realistically it’s
the quantity that counts in the
end.

Rockefeller has this quantity. Just
looking at his campaigns one can see
the support that he has been get-
ting. Granted this has not all been
there from the beginning, but it’s
the end that counts. Rockefeller, by
convention time, will have the sup-
port that will enable him to get the
nomination. For as the weeks go by

Johnson and leading this country as

Miss Marjorie Norris

Mass M. Norris
To Head Group

Miss Majorie Norris, of St. Agnes
High School in Alexandria, Vir-
ginia, wa selected chairman of the
1965 SIPA Advisory Committee yes-
terday.

Miss Norris is the newspaper ad-
visor of the St. Agnes Shearings.
She was chosen at the adviser’s
luncheon held yesterday afternoon.

She succeeds Mrs. Nancy Brough-
ton, of Thomas Dale High School,
Chester, Virginia.

The chairman acts as co-ordinator
between ithe committee and the Lee
Memorial Journalism Foundation,
which sponsors the SIPA conven-
tion. The committee’s main func-
tion is to offer suggestions on im-
proving the convention.

 

Confusion High Here
Because of Leap Year

May is always a hectic month
for students in the journalism de-
partment at Washington and Lee.
The week before the annual SIPA
Convention is enough to put even
the toughest journalist on edge.

This year, May will be an even
busier month than usual. The stu-
dents in the department must give
a great deal of their time to cov-
ering the Mock Convention. For-
tunately, this comes only once every
four years and therefore no one
has to go through the ordeal twice.

As if this wasn’t enough to dis-
tract even the most ardent student’s
eyes from the books, just prior to
exams, there is an extra, added at-
traction this year. The George Mar-
shall Research Library is to be
dedicated May 23. President Lyndon
B. Johnson will do the honors with
the add of former Presidents Harry
S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisen-
hower. It will be a busy month,
and one in a lifetime for Lexing-
ton residents.

Defeats 41
In Contest

‘Him and Her’ a Rocket
Says Stymied Delegate

 

Two Rockbridge County, Virginia,
delegates from Natural Bridge and
Lexington have taken top honors in
the annual SIPA Currents Events
Quiz given yesterday afternoon.

Michael Zimmerman from Natur-
al Bridge High School won with a
top score of 68. Scoring a 66 was
Christine Capito of Lexington High.
There were 42 delegates taking the
test this year, ten more than last.
In 1963, the winning score was 89.

Answers this year varied as evi-
denced ‘by some of the incorrect con-
clusions.

Puppies Stymie Delegates

For Him and Her, the two Beagle
puppies of President Johnson, the |
delegates wrote a movie soon to be
released, a Broadway play just open-
ing, Profumo and scandel in Eng-
land, Richard Burton and Elizabth
Taylor, best selling book, by-words
of prejudice in Life magazine, name
for Russian spacecraft to carry man
and woman to the moon, and prince
and princess who ran off to get mar-
ried.

Barbara Streisand was called a
news reporter and commetator, a
new star with a large nose, and a
world swimming champion.

“The Deputy” was identified as
a recent TV program starring Henry
Fonda and Nikita Khruschev.

Johnson and Johnson

Ken Johnson, the Houston Colt
pitcher was noted as a distant rela-
tive of President Johnson.

Cathy May Baker, the 7-year-old
girl who wrote President Johnson
so that her grandmother could visit
her, was variously listed as the
daughter of Bobby Baker, a witness
in the Bobby Baker trial, a stripper,
an American swimming champ, a
witness in the Jack Ruby Trial, the
wife of Bobby Baker, a woman on
the Atomic Energy Commission, and
a nurse of the late President Ken-
nedy.

Huff Tough Too

Sam Huff, brutish linebacker of
the New York Giants recently
traded to the Washington Redskins,
was recognized as a golfer compet-
ing internationally, winner of the
International Open, a senator run-
ning for President of the United
States, a ballet dancer, a crooner,
star of the Metropolitan Opera, and
United States chess champion.

The movie “842” was termed the
high jump record and a nuclear cut-
back plan.

Meetings Keep SIPA Delegates Busy

Round-tables and short courses
were again the heart of the SIPA
Convention this year. Delegates to
the convention could choose from
24 round-tables and 16 short courses.

There were round-tables for the
staffs of newspapers, magazines, and
yearbooks. In addition to these cate-
gories, photography was added to
the list of subjects tackled in the
short courses.

The round-tables and short courses

 

were held all day Friday and Sat-
urday morning. There were 12 news-
paper round-tables, four magazine
round-tables, and five yearbook
round-tables,

Four short courses were offered in
both the newspaper and magazine
fields. There were three photograph-
ic short courses and five yearbook
short courses.

The round-tables were run by the
delegates themselves, with a few

 

Interview Format Praised

By Trussell In Chapel Talk

At a talk in Lee Chapel Saturday,
Tait Trussell told SIPA delegates
about the pros and cons of the
question and answer format in news
reporting. Trussell a Washington
and Lee graduate, is currently the
associate editor of Nation’s Business,
a magazine published by the Cham-
ber of Commerce of the United
States. He addressed the students
and their advisers shortly after 11
a.m.

Mr. Trussell said that a story pre-
sented in a question and answer
format can be as dramatic as a
murder trial and as authoratative as
an official text. He called the dele-
gates attention to the fact that more

 

and more newspapers and magazines
are rediscovering the question and
answer format. Many newspapers
and magazines make it a point to
regularly publish interviews in this
fashion. He went on to say that this
is their way of competing with the
host of interviews on television.

He explained how he had request-
ed and was waiting for a time to
interview then-Vice President Lyn-
don Johnson when the news came
of the assasination of President Ken-
nedy.

Format Permits Control

Press, likes the question and an-

exceptions. The advisers to the var-
ious delegations presided and kept
things moving.

The short courses were run by
“experts“ in teaching and private
business. Mr. Howard Hammersley
manager of the photographic de-
partment of the Roanoke (Va.)
Times and World News met with
three different sessions.

Mr. James Boatwright, editor of
Washington and Lee’s literary mag-
azine, Shenandoah, and instructor in
English at the University, gave
three short courses in magazines.

The yearbook short courses were
given by Mrs. Pearl Hanson, for-
merly of Washington-Lee High
School; Dr. Regis L. Boyle, Wood-
row Wilson High School and Catho-
lic University of America; and Fred-
erick F. Hafner, with the University
Press Division of William J. Keller,
Ine., publishers.

The newspaper short courses were
given by four members of the pro-
fesisonal press. William G. Lev-
erty, assistant managing editor of
the Richmond (Va.) Times-Dispatch,
gave a course in newspaper design.
Other professionals participating
were William Fishback, Richmond

Childs Cautions Press

By TIM O'KEEFE |
The American press must meet the
revolutionary change that is being}
undergone in every department of |
life, Marquis Childs, syndicated |
Washington columnist, told SIPA}
students yesterday.
Childs said that all communica-|
tions media must become more ob-|
jective in their coverage if they are
to carry out their share of respon-|
silibity in this time of challenge.
Acting as a combination Cassan-
dra and complainant in his talk
Childs first posed these two ques-|
tions to his audience. Do the news|
media give sufficient evaluation to
the news they print? And just be-
cause some has made a statement,
does that necessarily make it news?
He gave two examples of where
the press had failed in both respects.
“It was just 10 years ago today
that the Senate was wrestling with
the problem of Sen. Joseph Mc-
Carthy and the way he had flouted
the rules of the Senate and made
a shambles of Senate dignity with |
his infamous ‘hearings’.” Childs said. |
“That all started with a casual|
radio talk by McCarthy in which he|
declared that there were 69 card-
carrying communist in the State
Department. Most news media gave
that sensational play without eval-|

 

 

“After a long conflict it was estab- |
lished that McCarthy did not have)
the name of a single card-carrying |
communist in the State Department. |
But by that time he had discredited |
three or four individuals by in-|
nuendo,” he said.

“The question I would like to leave |
with you today is whether the
fearful damage done by McCarthy |
might not have been avoided by |

| another approach. It seems to me!

that we had an obligation to eval-|
uate and to include that evaluation |
as part of the news report. That
false statement made by that single
irresponsible individual did incal- |
cuable harm,” Childs said.

In 1960 the Democrats put a lot}
o fstress in their emagiapfnro T E}
of stress in their campaign for the
presidency on the “missile gap.” |
The missile gap was a myth. It
originated largely out of propaganda |
of the Air Force Intelligence, which
had greatly over-estimated the |
Soviet missile capacity, childs said.

The press made headlines out of
the story but it was almost entirely |
without foundation. This also points |
out one of the unhappy aspects |
of political life today, he said.

“Big defense contracts have be-|
come entangled with partisan poli-
tics. You will hear the ‘ins’ asking |

“This kind of political pressure is | type of

expenditure. In my opinion the press| can convention July

has an obligation to challenge this

campaigning,” Childs said.

Francisco, Childs said that Sen. Bar- |
ry Goldwater could come close to}

ballot.

Still, there is room for doubt that |
Goldwater will win the nomination. |
He has not stacked up too well in|
publie opinion polls as the man who

would run best against President
Johnston.

“If Goldwater fails in his bid, he|
will have so much strength that

he probably will be able to select
the candidate himself. I believe that
he will throw his support to Rich-
ard Nixon, who would serve as
the party’s best compromise candi-
date,” Childs said.

Childs sad he personally thought
Lodge or Scranton would make the}
most effective candidates against |
President Johnson next November. |
But the chance that either will get |
the nomination is small, he said.

Marquis Childs has been a news-
paper man for 40 years. During this
time he has established a reputation
as a specialist in the reporting of |
international and national news.

Childs was born in the Mississip-
pi River town of Clinton, Iowa. He
decided at the age of 13 that he
wanted to be a newspaperman. He
does not remember what prompted |
that decision. His father was a law-|
yer and his forebearers had been
farmers.

landed a job with the United Press
in Chicago. He resigned a year later
to take his M.A. degree at the Uni-
versity of Iowa. In 1925, Childs re-
turned to the United Press, this time
in New York.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch

| lured Childs west in 1926. He took

a job with the paper as a feature
writer. He was soon covering stories
all over the country. He was sent to
Europe in 1930 and spent several
months there studying and reporting

| the economic and social effects of the

changing governmental policies in
Scandinavia, Germany and the mid-
dle European countries. In 1936 he
was named Washington correspon-

| dent for the Post-Dispatch.

Shortly before World War II he
visited Mexico and _ studied that
country’s oil expropriation program.

| Several of his reports were “so hot”

that an investigation of several
prominent U.S. Senators was order-
ed. Childs was roundly denounced
from the Senate floor by the af-
fected senators, but he sued and
won a full apology from all con-

| concerned. The Senators had charged

him with biased reporting in speech-
es on the Senate floor.

During the war Childs saw much
of the world. He covered events

| in England, Brazil, Sweden, and Bo-

ivia. His now famous Washington

King Features Syndicate, appeared
before the 35th annual SIPA Con-
vention Friday in Doremus Gymna-
sium. He spoke at a General Ses-
sion of the convention at 12:05 p.m.
He followed Marquis Childs, noted
columnist, who addressed the con-
vention at a General Session shortly
after 11 a.m.

This year’s visit marked the second
time that Sagendorf has appeared
before the group. His last visit
was to the 3lst annual convention in
1960.

Expert on Popeye

The subject of Sagendorf’s talk
was “Life with Popeye.” There is
no one person living who is as qual-
ified as Sagendorf to talk on this
subject.

While still in high school, Sagen-
dorf, who is a native of the state of
Washington, went to work for the
late E. C. Segar, the creator of
“Popeye.” He could not have found
a better teacher. Segar was the
master of the humorous continuity
strip.

Sagendorf says he took up draw-
ing at an early age because it was
easier to draw than to spell. He has
since mastered the art of spelling,
with a few possible exceptions he
admits.

While working under  Segar,
Sagendorf had the fun of “going
through the labor pains of the birth
of many wonderful characters such
as Swee’pea, Eugene the Jeep, Alice
the Goon and Poopydeck-Pappy.

Takes Over Strip

After Segar’s death in 1963, Sagen-
dorf was called east by King Fea-
tures to continue Segar’s work on
the strip. It was not long before he
was lured to a desk job, assistant
comic art director in charge of pro-
duction.

 

He did the job well, but when
King Features decided to publish
a “Popeye” comic magazine, he once
again climbed behind the drawing
board. He undertook to draw and
write the entire magazine.

In 1959, Sagendorf again took over
the daily and Sunday comic strip.
This load was in addition to the
magazine.

Starts Cartoon Course

In 1950, Sagendorf joined the
faculty of the Famous Artists
School in Westport, Conn., where he
now makes his home. Five years, and
hundreds of cartoons later, he started
the course in cartooning now offer-
ed by the school. His course is now
being followed by hundreds of to-
morrow’s cartoonists.

Sagendorf is married and _ has
three children. Among his hobbies is
the creation of toys and games, most
of which are connected with his
cartoon characters. He has taken up
bowling in the past few years and
builds quarter sized gasoline racers.

“Tf I hadn’t been born a coward,”
he comments philosophically, “I
would like to own and drive a real
racing car.”

 

Seven States

Represented

The 35th annual SIPA Convention
was attended by 1,023 students and
their advisers.

The delegates represented 183
public and private schools from
North Carolina, South Carolina, Vir-
ginia, Maryland, Tennessee, West
Virginia, Georgia, and Washington,
Da.

The ratio of girls to boys at the

was about two to one, fractions being
impossible.

Banquet Ends Convention

The awards were announced at

quet, held in Doremus Gymnasium
this afternoon. More than 1,023 dele-
gates and their advisers attended
the luncheon, which officially closes
the activities of the convention for
another year.

The Virginia Scholastic Press

the Virginia Press Association.
The Star and its staff were cited

“for its bold new look;...for cut-

ting costs;...and meeting its bud-

get;. ..for creating new interests
and support,...and for fostering
better faculty, student, and staff

relations.”

The Eagle’s citation commended
the North Carolina paper and its
staff for their “...energy and enter-
prise in using the newspaper as a

molder of opinion to spur desirable | |

action...its general excellence...
and because of its pleasing makeup.”

The award was presented to The
Eagle by Prof. J. Paxton Davis, a
member of the Lee Memorial Jour-

tive of North Carolina. The Eagle is
in Group II.

Objectiveness Praised

Prof, Paxton Davis

Davis Directs
Short Courses

Paxton Davis, professor of journal-
ism here, is serving as director of
SIPA short courses again this year.

A member of the faculty since
1953, Davis has authored two books
and published a number of short
stories, poems and articles. His lat-
est story was published in the No-
vember, 1962 issue of Playboy.

Before coming to W&L, Davis
worked on the Richmond Times-
Dispatch and the Winston-Salem
Journal and Sentinel. He is presently
book editor of the Roanoke Times
and has served as editorial writer
and business editor on the Winston-
Salem newspapers during the sum-
mer,

Follows Routine

Davis says he writes best when
following a daily routine. He is now
working on his third book. The first,
Two Soldiers (1956), includes two
short World War II novels. The Bat-
tle of New Market (1963) is a non-
fiction work dealing with the Civil
War battle.

Davis served as director of SIPA
in 1958, while O. W. Riegel, director
of the Lee Memorial Journalism
Foundation was on leave of absence
in Paris.

Two years earlier, he had become
a Fellow in Fiction of the Bread
Loaf Writers Conference, a Vermont
literary organization which stimu-
lates the exchange of ideas between
novelists and prospective writers.

Wins VPA Award

In 1951, while working for the
Times-Dispatch, Davis received the
first place award in series writing
from the Virginia Press Association. |

A native of Winston-Salem, Davis
attended Virginia Military Institute
in 1942-43, before entering the army |
in World War II.

He graduated from Johns Hopkins
in 1949 with an A.B. degree in Eng-
lish. There he served as editor of
the yearbook for two years, and as|
columnist for the newspaper.

Davis is married and has three|
children,

 

ly newscast from the W&L radio
newsroom, is a unique combination
of classroom, laboratory and extra-
curricular activity. International,
national, sports, state and local news
are covered in the student broadcast.

Since Home Edition is on the air
five nights a week, it is the primary
source of local news for area citizens.
Often it beats the weekly county
newspaper and school paper by sev-
eral days in breaking a story.

The W&L produced newscast is
the last news show of the evening
aired by radio station WREL.

Students Report Local News

Local news is covered by mem-
bers of W&L’s journalism depart-
ment, with each student covering a
“beat” for two semesters while at-
tending the university. Other Home
Edition news arrives via Associated
Press teletype.

Regular beats covered by the stu-
dent reporters in the county include
the town and county offices, police
stations, club and charity organiza-
tions, VMI and W&L and the sports
activity in the area.

All stories are rewritten by mem-
bers of each of the five nightly staffs
in order to produce a program of
sound format and consistent style. A
typical night in the Home Edition
newsroom often includes scurrying
around to cover a_ late-breaking
story, tape recording Radio Moscow
for “the other side of the story,” or
taping the remarks of the many
prominent speakers who visit W&L.

Bruce Whelihan, a senior from
Philadelphia, Pa. is Home Edi-
tion news director this semester.
Senior editors who direct each of
the five nightly shows are Guy
Unangst, Steve Owen, Rick Krall,
Peter Blakeslee and Whelihan.

Editorials Broadcast

In addition to its regular news-
gathering tasks, Home Edition usu-
ally broadcasts an editorial each
Friday night and special editorials
when the need arises. (The Ken-
nedy assasination.)

For all practical purposes, the
senior editor is completely in charge
of his staff's broadcasts. He makes

Posters
Confuse
Visitors

Delegates to the 35th annual
Southern Interscholastic Press As-
sociation Convention had a hard

time finding out who was running
for the presidency of SIPA for the
coming year.

The confusion was the result of
the signs throughout the town sup-
porting Scranton, Lodge, Nixon,
Rockefeller and Goldwater for the
presidency. Was there really a mister
and miss named Scranton running
for SIPA president?

No, there was not. The posters are
all part of the color and the chaos
that comes when it is Mock Conven-
tion time at Washington and Lee.

Each presidential election year the
student body of the University holds
a political mock convention, run just
like the real conventions scheduled
during the summer.
for later in the summer.

A Republican Year

This year the job is to nominate
a Republican to run for the office
of President of the United States.
The convention always features the
party that is out of office.

In 1960, when the last Mock Con-
vention was held, the students nom-
inated a Democrat, Sen. John F.
Kennedy, to head his party’s ticket
in the national election. Sen. Ken-
nedy did win his party’s nomination
later the same summer, and went on
to defeat Richard Nixon in the na-
tional election.

The Mock Convention has been
held at Washington and Lee every
election year since 1908 with two
exceptions. There was no Mock Con-
vention in 1920 and in 1944 because
the country was at war.

Seven and Four Record

There have been seven correct
nominations. This means that Uni-
versity students nominated the same
person that the featured party nom-
inated in its official convention.

This year the Mock Convention
is being held Monday and Tuesday,
May 4 and 5. The convention will
begin with a parade Monday after-
noon. After the parade all the del-
egates will meet in the Doremus
Gymnasium, where the SIPA lunch-
eon was held this afternoon, and the
official convention will begin.

Judd Will Keynote

The feature attraction will be the
keynote address, which will be given
Monday night by the Honorable
Walter Judd, a former Congress-
man from Minnesota and the key-
note speaker at the Republican Con-
vention in 1960. The balloting for the
nomination will begin Tuesday
morning after the nominating
speeches and after the state chair-
men have had a chance to get in
touch with party leaders in the states
that they represent.

 

 

Judges Kept Busy

The 316 publications and the
four radio programs competing
for SIPA trophies this year came
from 183 public and _ private
schools.

There were 143 newspapers en-
tered for judging, 134 yearbooks,
and 39 magazines.

swer format because it allows him
to control the interview, according
to Trussell. He also explained that
David Lawrence, publisher of US.
News and World Report, uses the
interview as a means of getting
something similar to a signed article
by an expert.

Trussell told delegates of some of
his experiences interviewing such
people as the late Senator Robert 5S.
Kerr, who was known as “King of
the Senate.” He gave the delegates
some tips on preparing for an in-
terview and told them how to se-
lect the best subject for an inter-
view.

Studied Journalism

A Navy veteran, Trussell gradu-
ated from Washington and Lee as
a journalism major in 1949. He has
made Washington, D.C., his beat.
After graduation he was a Washing-
ton correspondent for the St. Peters-
burg, (Fla.), Times. He once served
on the editorial staff of Congression-
al Quarterly News Features. Before
joining the staff of Nation’s Busi-
ness, he was a member of the Wash-
ington bureau of the Wall Street
Journal and a reporter for the Wash-
ington Star.
Trussell is a member of Sigma
Delta Chi, a journalistic society,
and the recipient of the 1961 Loeb
Special Achievement Magazine
Award for distinguished business
and financial writing. He is the au-
thor of “Income Taxes 1862-1962,”
a light history of the Internal Rev-
enue Service; and he created and
produced a documentary record
album entitled “Best of Washington
Humor.” The Trussells and their
two sons live in Washington. He is
a third | generation journalist.

Lee Offered

First Course
In Journalism

“Aibusrd,” said E. L. Godkin of
the New York Evening Post, when
he heard that Gen. Robert E. Lee
was planning to add a course in
journalism to the curriculum of
Washington College (now Washing-
ton and Lee University).

This was in the post-Civil War
era, when journalism instruction was
still an untested idea. It was in
1869, when Lee was president of
Washington College, that the first
Press Scholarships were established.

The scholarships, 50 in all, went
to “young men proposing to make
printing and journalism their life
work and profession.”

Courses Suspended

But General Lee died in 1870,
the Reconstruction brought hard
times, and instruction in journalism
was suspended in 1878. The revival
of the courses was not again con-
sidered until 1921.

In that year, president Henry

under him are Lynwood Pullen, Ed-

The title “America’s Baskerville

recognition he received for skillful
use of Baskerville type.

50 Years With Trade

Since his middle teens, Lauck has
been connected with the printing
business and has built up a back-
log of more than 50 years of ex-
perience. Next year he will be-
gin his 34th year at W&L.

1945 he was appointed to cover the
fighting fronts in Italy, France and
Germany.

Since the end of the war, Childs
and his wife have used their Wash-
ington home as their base. In the
past 15 years he has made more than
36 trans-Atlantic flights, and has re-
ported first hand almost every ma-
jor diplomatic conference, interna-
national crisis and summit or near
summit meeting.

Authored Best-Seller

Childs is also the author of many
books, fiction and non-fiction. His
latest, “The Peacemakers,” is a
novel about the time of crisis in
top-level international diplomatic
circles. Earlier books include his
1958 non-fiction best-seller “Eisen-
hower: Captive Hero,” and others.

He has received many journalistic
honors, including the Sigma Delta
Chi award “for sustained insight in
international affairs, firsthand re-
porting, and effective writing.”

 

Classrooms and Printshop

To Move

The journalism department will be
moving into a new building over
the summer. Work began last June
on the remodeling of Reid Hall,
which will house of the department’s
facilities now located in Payne Hall
and in the old print shop.

Under Reid Hall’s new roof will
be facilities for: (1) Classrooms and
offices for basic instruction and re-
search programs related to the mass
media, public opinion and advertis-
ing. (2) Professional facilities in-
cluding news, printing, advertising
and film laboratories, wire room,
radio and television studios and
photographie studies. (3) Accommo-
dations for professional seminars. (4)
Offices for external services func-
tions such as administration of the
duPont radio-television awards and
SIPA. (5) Specialized library and
reading rooms and archives for au-
dio-visual materials.

Printshop Will Move

Present plans call for the ground
floor to contain a fullsized print shop.
All the equipment formerly used in
the journalism laboratory press will
be moved to the new structure. The
fourth floor will house several pho-
tographic darkrooms.

The second floor has been re-
modeled to include offices, class-
rooms, a library and _ conference
room.

The third floor will contain a reg-
ular newspaper city and wire room,
an advertising laboratory, film, tape
and record libraries and radio stu-
dios.

The department eventually plans
to broadcast from its own FM radio
station. Long range plans also call
for incorporating a television stu-
dio in the broadcasting facilities of
the department.

W. W. Coffey and Son, local con-
tractors, did the renovation.

The Department of Journalism and Communications this summer will

formerly ran his own print shop
at his home in nearby Buena Vista
and annually teaches a newspaper
short course to SIPA delegates.

Backus often is assisted by Ed-
win Walker, one of the most versa-
tile men in the shop. In addition
to doing the composing and running
the shop’s two smaller job presses,
he operates the machine which
folds the newspaper and after they

ments for rewriting, editing copy

and constructively criticizing his

writers.

He may choose to have a certain
person handle types of stories: for
instance, one man is in charge of
national and international news, an-
other deals with state and regional
and a third compiles the sports news.

On election nights the staff may
be up most of the night transmitting
the results to area listeners. Next
week will be a busy one Monday

tisements.

The completed forms for the pap-
er then go to Don Tabbut. All five
men work in the small shop behind
Washington Hall. Steps are current-
ly being taken to expand the capa-
city for work which the print shop
can handle and recently a new
Linotype machine was added to the
shop’s equipment.

The list of awards won by Lauck
for his topographic skill includes a
Distinguished Service Citation at the
annual SIPA awards banquet “in
recognition of outstanding accom-
plishments in the field of scholas-
tic publishing and in acknowledge-
ment of devotion and effective serv-
ice to journalism, to education and
to youth.”

In the Inland Printer, the printing
industry’s leading trade journal,
Lauck has been featured as one of
the nation’s top typographical crafts-
men.

Some of his work was selected for
the 1964 Commercial Printing of the
Year Exhibition of the American In-
stitute of Graphic Arts. The exhibi-
tion, which traveled throughout the
nation, represented the work of some
200 out of 3,000 printers who en-
tered.

Until recently Lauck also con-
ducted classes for the journalism
department, teaching journalism stu-
dents the rudiments of type setting
and printing and explaining the var-
ious machines used in production of
printed materials.

This task is now being performed
by Edward Backus.

he has been present for 10 previous

The parade was headed by 2 live
elephants, representing the Repub-
licean Party. Following the elephants
were floats from 53 state delegations
and US. 6 bands, and
several beauty queens. Some of the

Many of the floats were based
on a Barry Goldwater theme. Some
of the floats read “Let's Barry|
Em” and “Barry or Secession.”
Other themes were anti-Lyndon
Johnson, such as one which dis-
played Johnson and his “Friends!
Secretary of Agriculture Billie Sol

Estes and Secretary of the Treasury

Bobby Baker.”

bined both these themes by dis-

a large figure of the state inscribed

Some of the floats favored the
other prominent candidates being
considered in the convention, New
York Governor Nelson Rockefeller,
former Vice-President Richard Nix-
on, Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge,

Pennsylvania Governor William
Scranton, and Senator Margaret
Chase Smith.

Other floats supported “darkhorse”
candidates such Frank Sinatra,
who was favored by Nevada as the
best “you could do for $19:95.” One
of the lesser known political parties,
the CroFaunJo Party, supported a
gangster character named Ed Side.

By ROGER PAINE
Editor-in-Chief

The 1964 Republican Mock Convention at W&L nominated
Senator Barry M. Goldwater of Arizona on the second ballot
at 3 p.m. today. Goldwater polled 718 convention votes to win
over his closest opponent, Governor Nelson Rockefeller of

New York, by 500 votes. Rockfeller polled 218 votes.
After the Wisconsin state chairman had cast all of his state’s

30 votes for Goldwater to put the*
Arizona Senator over the necessary
655 votes to win, the voting was
continued until Jimmie T. Sylvester,
chairman of the California delega-
tion, moved that the convention
accept Goldwater by acclamation.
The aye’s and nay’s were close, but
the motion was passed.

Behind Rockefeller in the final
voting were Governor William
Seranton of Pennsylvania with 182
votes, Richard Nixon with 106 votes,
and Henry Cabot Lodge with 104

 

votes. |

water’s nomination by acclamation |

The pattern of Goldwater's
tory was obvious from the start of
the second ballot. After nine states
had voted, the vote total on the|
second ballot was 100 for Goldwater
and 97 for Rockefeller, his closest
rival as opposed to 82 for Gold-|
water and 98 for Rockefeller at the}
same point on the first ballot.

the second ballot, and Rockefeller
had pulled up to only 117 votes, but

The Product Of A Year’s Work
By Eight Dedicated Students

It’s over now. Like the endless hours of preparation which
go into a 30-minute concert, the year of careful planning for
the 1964 W&L Mock Convention came to life in two days of
pomp, corcumstance, and well-documented balloting. Most of
us were on the periphery of things, drinking beer at delegation
parties and maintaining a steady gaze at the many beauty
queens who were guests of the convention. But there are a few
students who deserve to be singled out for their roles as plan-

ners of the pageant.

Sharp, Durrette, Rowe, and Madison

Philip Sharp, chairman of the Mock Convention Steering
Committee, has been the driving spirit behind the work of a
year. The success of the convention is the result of his con-
stant planning and his constant help with the work of other
members of the Steering Committee. He never contented
himself with being a coordinator—he worked himself to make
sure that each job would be done well.

It was Sharp who had the problem of getting speakers for
the convention which began as soon as he was appointed last
June. From then on, he was engaged in not only this, his pri-
mary responsibility, but all the other jobs too.

Wyatt Durrette, Chairman of the Republican Party for
the convention, was the political advisor not only to the Steer-
ing Committee, but to all fifty state chairmen. It was his respon-
sibility to guide the choice of the Mock Convention and to
make it as accurate as possible. From the beginning he felt
that the outstanding record of the past Mock Conventions was
a heavy burden on him, and he never stopped trying to keep
the record accurate. It was a job for which he had to lay aside
very deep personal convictions, and he did so consciously, in
order that his thinking would not influence the result of the
convention. Durrette had every political personality, trend,
poll, primary, and bill before Congress on the tips of his fingers,
and was the source to which Mock Convention officials went
for any political information.

Charles B. Rowe was assistant chairman of the convention,
but his real job was as financial chairman. Rowe did more than
a sufficient job of raising money for the convention, and be-
yond that he was the Mock Convention “banker,” handling
all the expenditures. After his task of money-raising was fin-
ished, he turned to publishing the convention Official Program.

The Parade Chairman was John Madison, but the title does
not do justice to the work performed. After lining up the big-
est parade in Mock Convention history, he began trying to
make Doremus Gymnasium look like a convention hall. Madi- |
son scoured the Virginia countryside looking for bands, and
spent more time trying to get elephants and decorations for |
floats. He also worked with the state delegations all year in an
effort to produce floats which would make a good parade.

 

Partington, Norton, Straub, and Smith

Donald Partington was Chairman of State Delegations,
8 s

Edward Norton, Secretary of the Mock Convention,
handled a correspondence this year which seems fantastic to
a student, or any person who has never worked the corres-
pondence of a big organization. Norton and the Secretariat
of the convention pushed through more than a thousand letters
from the Steering Committee itself. Without Norton on call
for letters at any time, it is difficult to see how the Mock Con-
vention could have gotten off the ground. Norton also was
charged with the Mock Convention records, something which
was neglected in past conventions, and with the balloting in

10 HOUSES REGROUP AS LIBERTY PARTY

 

Broadus To Receive Annual Gilliam Award

Progressive
Party Stull
In Minority

A new campus political party, the}
L.berty Party, was formed last week |
to end the of party}
structure” and political
climate.”

“imbalance
“unhealthy

The party composed of 10 frater-
nities, was formed from the now de-
funct University Party with the ad-
dition of two new houses, Sigma
Nu, and Pi Kappa Alpha, and the
loss of three others: Phi Ep, DU and
Sigma Chi. At present the party ros-
ter includes: Sigma Nu, Lambda Chi |
Alpha, Beta Theta Pi, Pi Kappa Phi, |
Kappa Alpha, Phi Delta Theta, Delta |
Tau Delta, Phi Kappa Sigma, Sig-|
ma Phi Epsilon. |

The chief significance of the re-|
alignment that Red Square is}
united again in alcost the same lines}
the old party that successfully |
dominated campus polities for ay
years.

The Party, led by Pi Phi junior,
Patton Adams, advocates a return to
a balanced party system, “although
the Liberty Party at present will
maintain a slight vote majority, such
majority would not be hard for any
other party to overcome.”

The “other party,” when it unites,
will be composed of seven fraterni-
ties. The remaining fraternity, Sig-
ma Chi, has adopted a policy of in-
dependence and remains unaffiliated
with the political blocks.

The sole purpose of the newly
formed party it “to nominate only
those persons who present them-
selves as the best qualified and most
capable for filling the positions.” The
Party “shall endeavor at all times
to present to you, the student body,
the best men we have.” Futhermore,

“appeasement will take no prece-
dence in our decisions.”

A {fier Campus Political Shake-up

 

Sigma Chi Decides On Neutrality

| now
_and is at work on a critical biogra-

Last Sunday, the Sigma Chi House
announced its intentions to sever its
connection with the W&L “clique”
system and to remain independent.
The unprecedented decision was
made with only one dissenting vote
in an emergency chapter meeting
Saturday.

In taking this course of action, the
fraternity determined that it would
no longer vote as a unit but as in-
dividual members in no way tied to
any party organization.

The following declaration was is-
sued Sunday evening:

“To the students of Washington
and Lee:

“The Sigma Chi House has de-
cided to renounce all affiliation
with any political party or clique.
In future elections, the members
intend to vote as individuals for
those candidates they consider
most qualified.

“We choose to become indepen-
dent because the present clique
system is an unjust and outmoded
means of providing competent stu-
dent leadership.

“we hope that | our action will

lead to superior student govern-
ment. We ask you to consider the
present political system—as indi-
viduals and students of Washing-
ton and Lee.

The Sigma Chi House”

In an interview, Sigma Chi presi-
dent Hal Holladay stated that
Sigma Chi House has decided to
become independent for three rea-
sons. First, we are opposed to the
present political system because it
does not always provide the student
body with the best candidates, and
because it gives only a few students
a voice in who is nominated.
“Secondly, the members wish to

able to vote as they choose for
whomever they choose without being
intimidated by any clique or party.

be

“It is our opinion that so long as
the clique system exists, the stu-
dent government of this university
will not have a chance either to be
selected or operated in a fair and
democratic manner.

“We in Sigma Chi believe that
every member of the student body
is aware of the evils of the present
system and we hope that our action

will serve as a stimulus for a move-
ment toward a better political sys-
tem.”

Sigma Chi’s withdrawal from the

| clique system came on the heels of

~

the formation of the “Liberty Par-
ty,’ which once again threw the
campus into a state of political flux.

Sigma Chi political representative

Nick Ruffin added to Holladay’s
comments, “This fraternity’s mea-
sure is a result of our disgust at}

still another change in the political
situation which does nothing but re-
hash the same old thing. We believe
that this constant revolution in
campus politics represents a grop-
ing attempt to escape the clique
system. We hope that there is a
way of doing this, through individ-
ual house action.”

Sigma Chi’s withdrawal from par-
ty politics leaves the two current |
parties split unevenly, ten to seven.

of the award which was

| created last year in honor of Dean Frank J. Gilliam, who re-
—* tired

in 1963 after many years as
Washington and Lee’s Dean of Ad-
missions and Dean of Students. The
first Gilliam Award winner was
Thomas Rains.

Broadus received the award “in
| recognition of outstanding service
| to the school, and specifically for
| his work as IFC president. During

| Broadus’ term in office the IFC for-

mulated a revised Rush Week pro-
posal, and created a Judicial ,Board
to make the Council self-govern-

| ing in matters of fraternity conduct.

Broadus also instigated a nominating
committee for IFC officers in order
to keep elections out of the con-
trol of political groups.

In addition to being president of
the IFC Broadus has been president
of Kappa Alpha fraternity, a mem-
ber of the Liberty Hall Society and
the Dance Board, and is a Dean’s
List and Honor Roll student. Broad-
us’ home is Knoxville, Tennessee.
He is a pre-med student.

The Award was established by the
Executive Committee last year, con-
sisting of $100 to the recipient and
$150 to a campus organization or de-
partment of the school which shall
be designated by the recipient.
Rains, the first to be honored, gave
the $150 to the English Department
for use in the Moffatt Seminar Room.

Letter To The Editor

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi
I have seen farces in my life, but
I believe that the new “Liberty Par-
ty” takes the cake. Not a few times
have the students at Washington
and Lee been deluded by shrewd
politicians, but this outrage is an
affront to the intelligence of a mo-
ron. No doubt you have heard the
cliche “A rose is a rose...”; by
the same token, so’s a_ skunk.
Strange things fear works with the
high and mighty.

AU H20 Gets 601 Ist Ballot Votes

Even Goldwater supporters were
surprised by the high total of 601
convention votes for their candidate
on the first ballot of the W&L GOP
Mock Convention. The Arizona Sen-
ator led his nearest rival, Nelson
Rockefeller, by 369 votes. Rockefel-
ler polled 232 votes on the first bal-
lot.

The rest of the candidates showed
as follows: Lodge, 113 votes; Scran-
ton, 102 votes; Nixon, 60 votes; Rom-
ney, 44 votes; Smith, 15 votes; and
141 votes pleged to various favorite
sons.

17 States 100% Goldwater

Seventeen states gave all their
votes to Goldwater on the first bal-
lot: Alabama, Arizona, Florida,
Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Ne-
vada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South
Carolina, Texas, and Wyoming. The
total vote power of these states is
343 votes.

Other states whose voting was
split on this ballot but which cast
significant majorities to Goldwater
were: Illinois, Kentucky, North
Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia.

Rockefeller’s Support

The bulk of Rockefeller’s votes
came from California, which gave
him all 86 of its convention votes,
and from New York which threw its
92 votes to the governor. Governor

Convention Boasts Lots Of Color

Almost unrecognizable under the
most elaborate decorations of any
past Mock Convention, Doremus
Gymnasium resounded with dozens
of instances of spontaneous, thun-
derous applause at the opening ses-
sion of the convention Monday af-
ternoon. Part of the show was the
speeches delivered by the distin-
guished guests, Lukens, Poff, and
Judd. The rest of it was the sight
of the “convention hall,” the color-
ful outfits worn by many of the
state delegations.

Red, white and blue bunting
was everywhere; balloons hung
from the ceiling. Every state was
represented by its flag, hanging
from the guard rail of the indoor
track. A huge Rockefeller poster
dominated the west end of the
room, with a less conspicuous
Goldwater poster facing it on the
east side. Between them and on
either side were posters proclaim-
ing the qualities of Ledge, Nixon,
Scranton, and Smith,

The ceiling of the gym was al-
most obscured not only by candi-
dates’ posters but by circular
“GOP” signs, American flags, and
convention paraphernalia of every
size and description.

No less colorful was the conven-
tion floor, jammed with delegates,
many of whom waved state flags
or banners with the names and
pictures of the candidates backed
by their state. “Indiana’s Sold on

Earlier this year the EC had
asked for recommendations from
interested students as to who should
receive the award, and the judging
for the eventual recipient was then
made solely on the basis of valuable
contribution to student affairs. This
contribution need not have been
made through any student office or
established organization, and may
take the form of outstanding work
in one or several fields.

Scranton Boom Defeats Nixon By 17 Votes

By BILLY CANNON

William Warren Scranton, Gov-
ernor of Pennsylvania, upset former
Vice-President Richard M. Nixon
as Washington and Lee’s choice as a
running mate with Arizona Senator
Barry Goldwater in the 1964 cam-
paign.

Seranton’s selection copped wide
spread enthusiasm from the dele-
gates as he took a 664-647 victory
from the New York lawyer.

Nixon had been nominated by
the “Goldwater-in-64” Chairman
Bill Burke after consultation with
several Goldwater officials who indi-
cated he would be the Senator’s
choice.

“Nixon was the man I was in-
structed to nominate,’ commented
Burke. “However Senator Gold-
water did not express a personal
preference. He said he would be
happy to run with whomever the
Republicans nominated.”

The former vice-president took a
comfortable lead in the late Tues- |
day balloting only to see it dwindle |
as the Washington and Lee delegates |
found favor in bucking the tradi-
tional selection by the Presidential
nominee-elect. Nixon at one point
moved over the required 655 votes
only to have Michigan switch its 48

 

votes on a recall, giving Scranton
the victory.
Governor Scranton
Pennsylvania Chairman Doug Mc-

Dowell accepted the “draft” for
Scranton. The Wealthy Pennsyl-
vanian who hails from the city

named for his family found the
draft nothing new. In fact his en-
tire political career has been marked
by drafts. He has never declared his
candidacy for a political office be-
fore a draft demanding his services
was offered.

He began his political career as a
Congressman from the 10th Con-
gressional District in 1960. His con-
siderable margin of victory in a
democratic area made him a prime
choice for the governorship in 1962.
He was again drafted and defeated
Philadelphia’s Mayor Richard Dil-

worth substantially. This victory
promoted his name to national rec-
ognition.

Scranton is considered a moderate
in most political circles. His major
work in Pennsylvania has _ been
centered around reducing unemploy-
ment which he has done very suc-
cessfully. He is for States’ Rights,
against Medicare, and a proponent
of brinkmanship.

Scranton’s selection was viewed

 

as significant by most political writ-
ers covering the Convention. Most
felt the student’s choice showed wide
spread support for the Pennsylvania
Governor.

Associated Press Correspondent
Bill Johnson commented, “The en-
thusiasm shown for Bill Scranton
could prove significant if the real|
convention moves past Goldwater in
early balloting and selects a com-
promise candidate,

“Scranton is a virtual unknown in
national circles, but by the same
token he hasn’t alienated any voters |
either.”

As far as a running mate with
Goldwater, the reporters felt that
Scranton would be a logical choice
because he could offset the Western-
er’s agricultural appeal with a
Northeast industrial image.

Verified Facts

Senator Goldwater’s first ballot
total of 601 votes surprised most of
the twenty political reporters cov-
ering the Convention, creating spec-
ulation of a possible early ballot
repeat in San Francisco for the
Arizona Senator.

Melville Carrico, one of the state’s
finest journalists in the field, said,
“The first ballot total did seem a

 

little high to me when you consider

Goldwater didn’t receive any of
California’s 86 votes, but the boys
who have been working with the
individual states know a whole lot

more about the national picture

than I do. Your convention proved
significant because it was the coun-
try’s first real

indication of how

 

Scranton supporters begin enthusiastic demonstration.

 

the so-called “pros” view Senator
Goldwater’s strength and how they
will be voting in San Francisco.”

“You might think it’s unrealistic,”
noted Convention State Chairman
Don Partington, “but these individ-
ual chairmen have polled their
states as closely as possible. We
might not pick the Republican nom-
inee; however, if the National Con-
vention were tomorrow, Goldwater
would be nominated.”

It is generally felt across the na-
tion that Senator Goldwater has
strength now to win the nomination
in San Francisco in July because of
the large number of votes already
committed to him. However, two
possibilities loom high in the minds
of Republican leaders.

1. Goldwater must win within the
first two or three ballots if he is to
hold his pledged votes.

2. Goldwater must maintain his
present popularity with vast sections
of the country and must make a re-
spectable showing in the California
primary.

Time seems to be the key to
these two possibilities and only
time will tell if the students of
Washington and Lee have made
their ninth correct choice in 13 at-
tempts.

Hodges Criticizes ‘Playboy’
For Hedonistic Sex Views

Dr. Louis Hodges, Assistan

t Professor of Religion, spoke

Wednesday night on Playboy Philosophy. In the informal talk,
he covered such topics as: Playboy in American Society, Ethical
Principles in Playboy and Playboy on Girls and Sex.

He showed that Playboy Editor, Hugh Hefner, geared his

magazine to the boy who has
who feels that by reading Play-*
boy every month he can learn to
become a “stud.” Dr. Hodges feels
that the magazine served as a spokes-
man rather than the leader in the
present moral trend.

The speaker agreed with many of
Playboy's views, but felt that Hef-

recently become a man, and

 

ner saw too much in terms of black
and white while disregarding the
ambiguity of many important is-
sues. In this manner, he speaks out
on philosophical matters that are
unable to be reduced to such simple
terms as he presents them.

Comparing Playboy with the
Greek Sophists, Dr. Hodges showed
the similarities of belief and pointed
out that the editors are prepared
to release this enlightenment to the
public—for a price.

Dr. Hodges felt that the modern
era has reduced sex to an animal
sort of consumption. The woman
has become no more than an aces-
sory to the male, like a pair of
cuff links. He pointed out that this
attitude is entirely maligned, and
further showed that the woman,
since she was human, should be
treated as human.

Concluding the speech, Dr. Hodges
presented his own views of sex,
saying that sex is not simply an
animal drive for pleasure, it is a part
of the development of the full hu-
man psyche. Man’s giving of him-
self to another is the ultimate ex-
pression of unity and should never
be divorced from love.

Chaffin Calls

Mr. William W. Chaffin, head of
the debate program, stated that this
year more people took part in more
debate tournaments than in recent
Washington and Lee history.

In all, over thirty people partici-
pated in eighteen intercollegiate
tournaments. Besides the eighteen
intercollegiate tournament, Chaffin’s
varsity debaters gave five audience
debates and appeared on one tele-
vision show. In addition, forty to
fifty more students participated in
practice debates.

educational value of debating as

Kendrick Wins
Frosh Award

Bryant Kendrick was elected out-
standing freshman of the class of
’67 by the Interfraternity Council
on Wednesday night.

Kendrick, a Phi Delt from Green-
ville, South Carolina, was appointed
to the Assimilation Committee in
the beginning of the year and was
elected in the last class elections to
a sophomore EC post for next year.

While maintaining a 2.2 grade
point ratio, he captained both the
freshman football and freshman la-
crosse teams. Kendrick has also been
active in the UCA and the Federa-
tion of the Christian Athletes.

In the determining of the honor,
each fraternity submitted the fresh-
man in their house who they thought
was most qualified. The Judicial
Board of the IFC then considered
each nominee before choosing the

Debate Season ‘A mazing

at any cost, Mr. Chaffin used pri-
marily sophomores and freshmen.
W&L’s two top debaters of last
year, Bill Noell and Al Eckes, did
not debate this year since Mr. Chaf-
fin wanted to expose others to the
benefits of debate. In the eighteen
tournaments this year, no one per-
son participated in over six.

Considering the inexperience of
the W&L debaters, Mr. Chaffin
termed this year as “an amazing
year.” In debate tournaments,
W&L took four first places, three
second places, and numerous indi-
vidual certificates,

The debaters won two first places
at the Regional Delta Sigma Rho-
Tau Kappa Alpha Tournament. Jack
Eure and Jay Clarke were chosen
the top affirmative debating team of
the tournament. Jay Clarke was
named the tournament’s top speaker
and Eure was named the second best
speaker.

In the Davidson Tournament W&L,
sparked by John McMurry, a soph-
omore, Ed Fitzgerald, a sophomore,
Sam Frazier, a sophomore, and Rick
Kneipper, a junior, posted a record
of ten wins and no losses.

Freshmen continued the winning
ways of the upper classmen. Alan
Cohen won a cup at the Randolph-
Macon Novice Tournament for be-
ing the top affirmative speaker.
Chaffin said that Cohen was the first
freshman debater to make a first
place showing in recent years. An-
other freshman, Bill Grant, won a
certificate at the University of Rich-
mond Novice Tournament in Feb-
ruary.

Washington and Lee debaters
competed in the three top debate

 

tournaments on the east coast—
the Wake Forest Dixie Classic, the
Georgetown Invitational, and the
Dartmouth Invitational. This is the
first time W&L has ever partici-
pated in all three of these tourna-
ments in the same year.

In the Georgetown Invitational,
the W&L team of Ed Fitzgerald and
John McMurry won four and lost
two. In the Dartmouth Invitational,

tik, Knoiiles
To Lead SSS

Dick Kreitler, Steve Sweitzer, and
Jack Baber were elected last week
to lead the Student Service Society
next year.

In an interview with the Ring-
tum Phi, president-elect, Kreitler,
stated that he intended to place
great emphasis on creating a SSS
that was more representative of
the University. He pointed out that
in the past the organization has
been composed chiefly of men from
only a few fraternities. It is his
policy to try to break the hegemony
by measuring the applicant by his
qualifications regardless of fraterni-
ty.

Kreitler, a Phi Psi, has been active
in the Commerce Fraternity the 13
Club, and as a fraternity officer.
Next year, along with the SSS, he
will serve as Editor of the Calyx
and President of Fancy Dress.

Sweitzer, a ZBT, holds a Warner
Pre-Medical Scholarship and_ has
been elected to Phi Eta Sigma, and

mittee, rush committee, and as social
chairman. He is the president-elect
of the Dance Board, and president
of his fraternity. He served as a
campaign manager for the Mock
Convention and has played both
varsity soccer and varsity tennis.

Larry Meeks, a Sig Ep, elected
vice president, has been on the IFC
for five semesters, serving as treas-
urer the past year, charity chair-

Stagnation In The EC?

To most students, the Executive Committee seems to be
a fairly stagnate body, performing only the perfunctory tasks
that are assigned to it. Committee appointments, honor trials—
surely these functions are important; however, as a source of
progressive leadership this year’s EC has hardly been vigorous.

Will next year’s EC handle only those duties which have
been performed well by the student government in past years?

Will it exhibit little initiative in

providing essential leadership?

Will the ’64-’65 EC prove to be merely a repeat performance?

Jim Kulp’s program for. next year, outlined at the new
EC's first meeting last night, answers in a very clear negative
to these questions. Kulp presented the program which the EC

will attempt to enact during

points:

e coming year in six major

1. Realizing that the EC is a representative body and wish-
ing to avoid unwarranted criticism resulting from ignorance of
EC procedures, the EC will attempt to bring about better un-
derstanding between the student body and the student govern-
ment through the publication of a schedule of business to be
conducted at future meetings, and of the minutes of past meet-
ings. Futhermore, EC meetings will be open to anyone in the

student body except when the
——

committee goes into executive

2. Kulp urged EC members to voice their opinions in the
mecting in order that the opinions might be discussed and
voted on before publicizing them.

3. Emphasis was placed on the fact that there was no place
for party lines on the EC, either in committee appointments,
inner-EC committees, or honor system trials.

4. An effort will be made next year to better town-Univer-
sity relations. The orderliness of the Mock Convention was cited
as an impetus to attaining the trust and good will of the towns-

—

In order to further support for athletic contests, a
abintan in student rates will be attempted between VMI and
W&L next year. This will increase attendance at both schools’
sports events. Futhermore, townspeople will be encouraged to

support W&L athletics.

6. Because they do play an important role in W&L life,
fraternities will be urged to show what they stand for. They are

more than “drinking clubs’;

; therefore, they should strengthen

their position in the interests ‘of their own preservation.
The emphasis of next year’s EC will be on progressive ini-
tiative. An attempt will be made to transform platform policy

into more than merely campaign promises.
We are convinced of the benefits to be gained through

the effecting of these programs. Therefore, we offer next year’s
EC very sincere support in determining to carry them out.

Mottley Reviews ‘Tom Jones’
Calls It ‘Cinema Masterprece’

By BOB MOTTLEY

Mr. Daves, the manager of the
State Theater, recently reported
with obvious relish that Tom Jones
had done more business in its first
week’s run in Lexington than any
other film that has never appeared
in his establishment, including Gone
With the Wind and Giant, two pre-
vious box office smashes. This being
the case, we are to have Mr. Jones
for a second week, and there should
be general rejoicing.

Masterpiece

Tony Richardson has fashioned a
cinema masterpiece exuding and oc-
casionally reeking bountiful life and
merriment. Tom Jones is a fervent
celebration of what it means to be a
man and a woman; Henry Field-
ing would doubtless be pleased.
Most of the humor is centered in
that hallowed and fashionable area
immediately below the belt, but I
can’t imagine anyone so prudish as
not to be swept away by its execu-
tion. It is good to be reminded that
sex can be fun and that God in His
infinite wisdom made it so—how else
could a man be induced to live with
a woman? We have had quite enough
of contemporary psychologists and
representatives of the Church who
insist on levying the grimmest over-
tones on sex. Tom Jones puts them
all to shame. It also gives a sting-
ing slap at the mores of the Play-
boy crew, who wouldn’t have half
as much fun, trying as they do to
play it cool even in bed.... Perhaps
the highest accolade that may be
laid (no pun intended) on this de-
lightful film is that all of its char-
marvelously human

acters are so
in their virtues and ah—shall we
say—improprieties.

Richardson’s direction is fleet and
crisp; his color photography is the
most splendid and eye-pleasing I
have ever seen in any film. There
are numerous tricks in montage
that occur from time to time, but
the audience is taken into the secret
very quickly and frequently can
only whimper its appreciation, be-
cause these episodes are spaced be-

tween periods of chest-racking guf-
faws. The music gives the film a
Mozart-like aural setting; the large
British cast is uniformly superb. In
short, Tom Jones is an exhilarating

experience; you couldn't take your |}
date to see a better film for enhanc- |

ing a long spring evening....
Rutherford

This is not, of course, to slight the
Lyric, a venerable scene itself of
many pleasurable and few regret-
table evenings. This has been a par-
ticularly delightful week at the arm-
pit. Margaret Rutherford starred in
Murder in the Gallop—and she sur-
prised no one by again proving her-
self (as if she had to!) the most
talented and delightful actress cur-
rently seen before the English-
speaking peoples. This is a whale of
a statement to make, but then Miss
Rutherford is a whale of an actress,
and I retract not one pound of it.

Mr. Side presents through Sat-
urday one of the all-time classics:
Casablanca, a story of intrigue star-
ring Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid
Bergman that is still as chilling as
when it was first released.

Hud

And, on Sunday, the Lyric shows
the greatest American Western ever
made, Hud. To be blunt, Hud is
the story of the greatest bastards
going, a whore-mongering, work-
shirking, family-insulting son of the
proverbial bitch superbly portrayed
by Paul Newman. Hud almost cor-
rupts his younger brother, Lon,
played straight by Brandon de
Wilde, but the boy turns to the
sounder ways of his grandfather,
Melvyn Douglas, and the homespun
sense of Alma, the family house-
keeper, played to the hilt by Patricia
Neal. (Neal and Douglas recently
won Oscars for their supporting
roles in this film.)

Hud is uncompromising and hon-
est, but its greatest contribution to
the cinema medium is its black and
white photography by James Wong
Howe, which richly deserved and

Goldwater Nomination Analyzed

 

By ERIC HANSSEN

The nomination of Senator Barry
Morris Goldwater this past Tuesday
seemed to be, in some cases, a large
and surprising disappointment to
many delegates and professionals
alike. Why this man was nominated
with such unexpected speed can
be explained in various ways; how-
ever, the dominating factor seems
to run along the lines of the opin-
ion given by Dr. E. L. Pinney and
several other members of the W&L
political science department after
the Convention had expressed its
preference.

The key industrial states, said Dr.
Pinney, had been necessarily ex-
posed to a factor of indecisiveness
because of the conflict of picking a
candidate that would appeal to the
state’s Republicans and to the

 

switch-over or middle of the road
vote. In other words, it was a
search for an acceptable Republican
who could win in an urban indus-
trial state.

The “Field”

In the search for such a candidate
the Republicans are running into the
problem of having “one candidate
and a ‘field’.” This “field” of can-
didates has no distinct personality
aside from its non-Goldwater char-
acteristics. Thus, in our convention,
and in the nation in general, one
feels the ambiguity of this movement
in its lack of a specific candidate.

“Most of the other votes (i.e., non-
industrial delegations im our con-
vention) were much less exposed to
the essential ambiguity of the cam-
paign, and thus did not split. These
votes followed the path of least re-

 

sistance which was to support the
only really committed candidate—
Barry Goldwater.” Dr. Pinney went
on to point out that the solid Gold-
water states might be compared to
a monolithic bloc while the states
that really seemed to grasp the am-
biguity of the situation were broken
up into various factions.
Monolith

Next the question arises: What is
this monolith and what are its chief
components? It is more than ob-
vious that this movement is a
western conservative one, but is it
more than just this! It is acknowl-
edged by several sources that Gold-
water’s appeal is not geographic as
much as it is strickly ideological.
The Goldwater movement, moreover,
seems to express more of a “feeling”
than a strict doctrine of belief.

Montgomery _—P®t- A vigorous
new party, the
Reform Party, has spontaneously

arisen with a basic platform of op-
position to the clique system. In the
recent elections, almost every major
candidate publically expressed dis-
satisfaction with the cliques. A new
party organization has been founded
with the intent of purging the evils
of the clique system. Finally, one of
the larger fraternities has taken the
heretofore unthinkable step of an-
nouncing its independence from the
system. All of these instances add up
to one thing—a basic dislike for the
clique system and a desire to end it.
Numerous Objections

To the Student Body:

After expressing gratitude to the
eight-man Steering Committee for
the splendid organizational job they
accomplished in making the Mock
Convention the success that it was,
I felt that a further word of thanks
was due all of those members of the
student body who worked on and
participated in the Convention.

The authenticity, enthusiasm and
behavior exhibited at the Conven-
tion could only have resulted from
the cooperation of every member
of the student body. It was one of
the finest displays of student respon-
sibility it has ever been my pleasure
to witness.

EDWARD C. ATWOOD
Dean of Students

Dear Sir:

It would be impossible for me to
congratulate every student person-
ally for the splendid way in which
the 1964 Republican Mock Conven-
tion was conducted. So I take this
method to extend to the student
body my gratitude and congratula-
tions for staging what certainly must
be the most colorful and best organ-
ized Mock Convention ever,

The personal leadership of Chair-

man Phil Sharp was magnificent, as
was the leadership at all levels of
responsibility. No chairman, it seems
to me, has ever been blessed with
such competent and imaginative as-
sistants in conceiving and execut-
ing the plans for the Mock Con-
vention. This high quality of per-
formance was evident throughout
the Steering Committee, the state
delegation chairmen, the campaign
managers, and the many special as-
sistants who contributed so much
time and effort.

It was particularly gratifying to
me to have members of the press
who covered the convention com-
ment on the excellent job being

 

done by Washington and Lee’s stu-
dents. These men often view such
events with an air of detachment,
either real or assumed, and virtually
all managed to betray at one time
or another that they were really
enjoying being here and writing
about the proceedings.

Again, my congratulations, and I
know that many of my assoeiates in
the administration and faculty join
me in thanking the 1964 Mock Con-
vention for a job well done.

Sincerely,

Anti-Clique Feeling Gaining Strength;

democratic. Candidates are picked
by a mere handful of clique repre-
sentatives. Clique meetings are held
in secrecy, and the ridiculously vast
majority of students have no control
over the nomination of their future
leaders. We ordinary students are
simply given a choice between A or
B, like it or lump it.

Futhermore, political bribery and
the necessity for keeping certain
houses in line often leads to the
nomination of inferior candidates, at
the expense of the really qualified
people. No matter how many good
leaders a house may have, it may
run no more than one or two for
office. Two or three houses frequent-
ly dominate a party, at the expense
of the other fraternities.

On the fraternity level, official
house affiliation with a party usually
leads to coercion of votes within the
house. Even if fraternity members
are not told to “vote party,” they
realize that their house will lose
out in the committee appointments
if the party’s candidates are not
elected.

Spoils System

This last fact brings us to the
spoils system. Newly-elected Execu-
tive Committeemen cannot but feel
some obligation to repay their sup-
porters, and qualified men are again
left out of the student government
because they are in the wrong party.
Candidates are chosen, not as indi-
viduals, but as party members.

Finally, the non-fraternity
are left out of the cliques and are
even more voiceless in the selection
of the candidates for whom they are
expected to vote than the fraternity
men. The percentage of independent
students is steadily rising, and this
large group can no longer be ig-
nored,

Ambiguity Splits Big States’ Balloting

This movement could be construed
to be a type of “Know-Nothingism”
which opposes the current adminis-
tration’s actions without actually
bringing forth many workable alter-
natives. “If Wallace can take 31 per
cent of Wisconsin,” said one political
science professor, “it’s obvious that
this ‘Know-Nothingism’ is not a reg-
ional aberration.”

Thus we find Goldwater being
swept along by a tide of dissatis-
faction which is the main factor
accounting for his popularity. It is
necessary to note, however, that
Goldwater did not create this move-

it is going in his direction.

Ambiguity in Search

The ambiguity in the search for
Goldwater’s Republican opponent
seems to be clearing. If our conven-
tion is to be any indication, it would
seem that the man to watch is Gov.
William Scranton, who did surpris-
ingly well for a man who was rela-
tively unknown last September.
(When asked if a Goldwater ticket
could be balanced by such a moder-
ate, Dr. Pinney commented, “it
would take Mao Tse Tung to bal-
ance that ticket.”)

The ambiguity must clear rapidly.
If it does not clear before conven-
tion time, the party may be dealt
a serious blow through factions
fighting among each other. If this
happens it could weaken party unity
to such an extent that Johnson’s
opposition (whoever he might be)
would be opposition in name only.

 

Baur Reviews
Mock Convention

By DREW BAUR
Friday Columnist
The Mock Convention, which
everyone had so long waited for,
has now passed. Its events, some
rather amusing, are worth review-
ing.
The pre-Convention parties began

| Saturday afternoon. The line at the

ABC store stretched out into the
street as preparation began. At
about five o’clock Monday morning
the parties ended and others began.

Finally, after long morning ses-
sions at the Paramount, Doc’s, the
Liquid, and Town Inn a rather quiet
parade started. Although colorful,
the parade would have been some-
what dull had it not been for two
interesting delegations.

The first of these delegations, the
Puerto Rican, began their prepared-
ness in the dying hours of Sunday
night and early hours of Sunday
morning. Not being at home in the
big city atmosphere of Lexington,
they chose the country estate of the
last Indian in Virginia to plot their
parade program. Unquestionably, the
gift to Mr. Judd was one of the
parade’s highlights.

At about the same time in the
heart of the Lexington metropolitan
area, the CroFaunJo delegation held
their meeting. After some discussion,
the clique decided to nominate Ed
Side for president. Surprise was of
the essence for this tweedy band
as they headed for the parade
grounds. Placed on the periphery of
the grounds, this group quietly re-
mained totally unnoticed until the
parade actually began. The enthus-
iasm and surprise of the crowd was
unmatched by anything ever before
seen in Lexington.

Unfortunately, Mr. Side ran into
the same problem that Adlai Steven-
son had at the Democratic Conven-
tion of 1960, namely that his over-
whelming popular support was not
shared by the party bosses. His lib-
eral platform met with no sympa-
thy from the conservative party
bosses, and thus the people’s choice
was forced to the sidelines. After
the convention had ended though,
even the party bosses began to see
their mistake and admitted that
Side would have just as much chance
as Goldwater of defeating Lyndon
Johnson,

CONVENTION SIDELIGHTS

Things to remember during the
convention were: Bing Crosby
Greene’s solo of the Oregon national
anthem; Delaware passing in favor
of Connecticut on the initial role
call; the effective Stop Barry move-
ment; a few subtleties with Miss
America; the Idaho float; Miss Tex-
as; and the return of several dis-
tinguished alumni of the Georgia
delegation.

Best Bets For The Weekend:
Giants to continue on winning
streak, Cleveland to slump, goodies
at Greenbrier, the carny skin show,
and Fun in the Sun Rum.

CAC Tourney Opens Today

Washington Favored to Repeat;
Generals Pin Hopes on Tennis

By GUY UNANGST
Friday Sports Editor
Five colleges will compete today and tomorrow in Danville,
Ky., for the Presidents’ Trophy, a 300-pound locomotive bell
emblematic of College Athletic Conference supremacy.
The event is the second annual Spring Sports Festival of
the CAC. The trophy goes to the general conference cham-
pion, computed on conference standings in football, basketball

and four spring sports—golf, tennis,*

baseball and track.

Last year’s champion, Washington
University in St. Louis, will be de-
fending the trophy against Wash-
ington and Lee, Southwestern, Se-
wanee and host school Centre.

Sewanee now leads the trophy
quest, with 35 points picked up in
football and basketball. Washington,
Southwestern and Centre have 30,
Washington and Lee 25. Points are
awarded on a 25-20-15-10-5 basis in
each sport.

Washington is favored to repeat
its championships in track and base-
ball, Southwestern to win again in
golf. The Generals are favorites in
tennis.

Teams Leave Yesterday

W&L’s track, baseball and tennis
teams left early yesterday morning
for play beginning this morning.

 

"LM WEEK

gS
“WITH ONLY THE first playoff
games completed by Wednesday,
Delt looked like a good bet to re-
peat as softball champ.

The Delts, who whipped past all
opposition in their league, opened
the playoffs with a 6-4 victory
over ZBT.

In the other opening playoff game,
Beta, who surprised most people by
taking their league’s title, outslug-
ged PiKA for an 8-6 decision.

Playoff activity continued yester-
day.

BETA WAS the only real surprise
to enter the tournament. The Betas
finished the regular season in a tie
with SPE, both having identical 3-1
records.

SPE was expected to take the
title since they had beaten Beta
20-12 in their opening match, but
Beta took their second game by
a 5-3 margin,

PiKA also had a close call before
taking their league’s title. Aifter
DU had whipped SAE 4-3, both
clubs had identical 3-0 records. The
teams were as evenly matched as
their records indicated, with PiKA
pulling out a 3-2 victory and earn-
ing the right to advance to the play-
offs.

Better Sports News

 

The golf squad left Wednesday in
order to play a practice round on
Danville Country Club’s course.

Last night the five schools attended
a dinner in their honor, after which
drawings were made to determine
pairings in tennis and baseball.

In baseball, the four visiting
schools will meet each other in the
opening round. Host school Centre
automatically gets a first round bye
(a fact which last year allowed the
tournament, to finish ahead of
Southwestern, at 2-1.)

Tennis is conducted as a series of
tournaments, one in each of six
singles and three doubles ranks.
Each includes championship and
consolation brackets, points being
awarded to champion and runner-
up in each bracket.

The golf champion is determined
in 36 holes of medal play, in which

 

CERI

Oe

each school enters four men, the
winner determined by the teams’
aggregate scores.

Track and field is run under of-
ficial NCAA rules.

Best Chance—Tennis

W&L’s best chance to win a sport
is in tennis, where the Generals fin-
ished third last year, behind Wash-
ington and Sewanee.

The same team will be playing
again this year, taking a 10-3 record
into the tournament. Its last regular
season match, against Virginia, was
rained out.

 

The Battle for the Bell

Randy Jones will again play num-
ber one. He has won eight of 12
singles matches this year. Jim De-
Young and John Baker are both
back in shape, and will play num-
bers two and three.

Jim Mell, Lindsey Short and For-
rest Dickinson round out the six
man squad Coach Bill Washburn
will take.

The baseball team will be hard
pressed to do as well as last year’s
second place finish, although it
soundly defeated Lynchburg 13-3
Wednesday, in its last regular sea-
son game.

 

To Pay Towson Tomorrow

The Washington and Lee lacrosse
team which has been riding high
for most of the season, unexpectedly
fell to Loyola of Baltimore yester-
day, 10-7.

‘Loyola jumped off to a quick 3-0
lead in the first quarter and never
fell behind, although the Generals
once tied the score 5-5 in the third
quarter.

 

 

Loyola midfielder John Stewart
(second team All-America last year)
was outstanding against the Gener-

als, scoring three goals and two
assists.
The Marylanders’ goalie, Tony

Federico, also played an excellent
game. He was credited with 14
saves.

General goalie Pete Noonan made

 

23 saves as Loyola outshot the Gen-
erals 54-35.

Attackman Carrol Klingelhofer
and midfielder John McDaniel led
the General effort. Klingelhofer had
one goal and three assists. McDaniel
scored three times.

Also in the scoring column for
W&L were Mike Michaeles with one
goal and two assists, Randy Wootton
and Bob Frost, each with one score,
and Pat Robertson, who made an
assist.

Robertson, a second midfielder,
also led the the team in recovering
ground balls. He picked up 10. The
Generals led Loyola in that depart-
ment 57-47.

W&L coach Bob McHenry said
that the team, “made a fine physical
effort but not a coordinated, intel-
ligent one.” He also said he hopes
the team can bounce back strongly
against Towson tomorrow.

CAC Begins Today In Danville

Last year W&L hosted the tourna-
ment and, with two seconds and two
thirds, finished second to the Bears
in overall point totals 110-105. This
year, without the advantage of the
home field, it will be a bit more dif-
ficult.

CAC

The CAC, designed to stimulate
intercollegiate participation “solely
because of interest in and the en-
joyment of the game,’ went into
operation September, 1962.

Centre, Southwestern, Sewanee
and W&L were charter members.
Washington joined shortly after it
was formed. Each school maintains

program.

pose. While purporting to end the
“big clique,” the Liberty Party es-
tablishes one. Though it has an-
nounced that its “sole intent” is to
present us with “the best qualified
and most capable” men, the Liberty
Party presumes that all of these
men are members of its bare major-
ity group.

What, then, is the answer? One
very good one has been advanced.
We could continue to have two par-
ties, but each house and the N.F.U.
could be represented in each party.
Each party would have 19 delega-
tions in it, and no fraternity would
be officially connected to a party.
As in our national system, individ-
uals, not voting-blocks, would be
the party members.

There are great benefits to be de-
rived from such a system. The ma-
chinery for nomination of candidates
would be preserved intact, without

‘Dean G. Acheson, Former Secretary Of State,

Four Others, To Assist Planning Of ‘Contact’

Dean G. Acheson, Secretary |
of State from 1949 to 1953,
leads a list of five national ad-
visors who will help coordinate
the projected weekend confer-

ence scheduled for Spring,
1965, named Contact. Acheson’s role
as an advisor to Contact, and the
agreement of four other men to
serve in a similar capacity, was an-
nounced today by Blaine Brownell,
Chairman of the 1965 Contact, and
Henry Quekemeyer, Assistant Chair-
man,

In addition to Acheson, the ad-
visors are Col. Francis P. Miller,
Philander P. Claxton, Jr., Dr. Mar-
shall Fishwick, and Dr. James W.
Silver. They will lend their pres-
tige and their advice and encourage-
ment to the program. Their services
will be rendered on behalf of a more
developed intellectural lecture and

Dean Acheson ons one of the coun-
try’s foremost experts on foreign
policy and is generally regarded as
one of the few outstanding states-
men this country has produced in
the twentieth century. Born in Mid- |
dletown, Connecticut in 1893, Ache- |
son attended Yale University and
the Harvard Law School and then)

 

entered upon a distinguished career | -

in the law and in government serv- |
ice that has led universities on both |
sides of the Atlantic to confer upon
him their honorary degrees and na-
tions of the free world to bestow
their highest decorations.

Acheson continues in both spheres
through the private practice of law
in Washington and as head of the
advisory group of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization. His publica-
tions include A Citizen Looks At
Congress; A Democrat Looks at His
Party; Sketches from Life of Men I
Have Known; numerous articles for
Foreign Affairs magazine; and he is
currently working on another book.

Interview With Acheson

Brownell and Phil Claxton, Special
Assistant for Contact, had an hour-
long interview with Acheson
last week, and they will see him
again in two weeks. According to
Brownell, “Mr. Acheson gave us
some truly significant advice about
the substance and organization of
Contact, and was very interested in
its suecess. He will do all he can to
help us with the program, and we
will present him with details of its

 

progress from time to time. We are
truly fortunate to have such a man
to help us.”

The Distortion

By JO TARTT

This is the first and great commandment,
thou shalt not lie.

And the second is like unto it,
thou shalt not cheat.

And still there is another,
thou shalt not steal.

Now this is the law,
And it is honorable that a man keep the law,
And any man who breaks the law

is a man who lives without honor.

For here,

beneath the eyes of Ole George

and above the honorable bones of Robert E.,
What is law is no longer law,

but has been made honor.
And that which is honor

is now ripped from its rightful place:

the secret domain of each man’s heart,
And is written and instructed and enforced.
And thus destroyed.

dipity Singers’

Group Signed
For Tuesday
Night Concert

The Serendipity Singers, a
group just catapulted to na-
tional fame by their first hit
“Don’t Let the Rain Come
Down,” will perform at Final
Concert Tuesday, June 2, it
was announced today by Ed Croft.
The concert will be held at 8:00 p.m.
in Doremus Gymnasium.

Ken Lane, president of the senior
class, is President of Finals, which
also includes a dance on Thursday,
June 4, in Evans Hall. Entertain-

ment for the dance is yet to be re-
vealed.

* With “Don’t Let the Rain Come

Down” (or “The Crooked Little
Man”) now among the Top 10 songs
in the nation, the Serendipity Sing-
ers have completed rise to the big-
time which began at the University
of Colorado and was extraordinarily
fast. The group consists of seven
men and two girls and its sound re-
calls the New Christy Minstrels who
became nationally popular last year.

The name “Serendipity” means,
according to Webster, “having the
faculty for making an unexpected
discovery of a new and_ happy
event.” The word is taken from
the Prince of Serendip, a fairy tale
character who possesses the faculty
of being “serendipity.”

The Serendipity Singers started
out at the University of Colorado
several years ago, at first being
composed of “a business administra-
tion student, a prospective ancient
historian, a would-be psychologist
and a bunch of music majors.” After
a great deal of success at college
functions, they picked up two gradu-
duates from the University of Texas
and the group was completed.

At this point they were “discov-
ered” by Fred Weintraub, owner of
The Bitter End in New York. Wein-
traub is the discoverer of Peter, Paul
and Mary, Woody Allen, and Bill
Cosby, as well as the possessor of
the same name as Lynne Weintraub,
one of the outfit’s two girls.

Weintraub ran the group in the
Bitter End for several months to
capacity crowds. Since this beginning
they have contracted with Mister
Kell in Chicago for a headline ar-
rangement, and have recorded a
long-playing album.

The “Hootenanny” television
shows have signed them to make
six appearances.

Croft commented on the singing
of the Serendipity Singers, “We are
lucky to have contracted with them
some months ago, before they reach-
ed the top. Because we spotted them
before they reached national popu-
larity, we were able to sign them for
a price which they wouldn’t look at

”

now.

There will be a meeting of the
Ariel staff Thursday, 7 p.m., in the
English Seminar Room. Anyone in-
terested in working on the staff next
year is urged to attend.

A Word About W&L’s ‘Fallen Men’

If a young woman was either raped or seduced in
pre-twentieth century society, she was thereafter con-
sidered “beyond the pale” of respectable people—she
was a fallen woman. However naive she might have
been at the time of her misfortune, whatever the emo-
tional circumstances framing that unhappy occasion
might have been, she was forever after an outcast—
indeed, she might as well kill herself, for her life was
over.

This theme, treated as it has been by some of the
most famous novels in English literature (Clarissa,
Tess of the D'Urbervilles), has a parallel here at Wash-
ington and Lee. A student who is convicted of lying,
cheating, or stealing (or failure to report such a viola-
tion) is considered by W&lL society a “fallen man.”
He is forever beyond the pale of Washington and Lee.
Like a malignant tumor, we cut him from our midst,
and give him twenty-four hours to get out of town
He knew the conditions of honor at W&L when he
enrolled; therefore, he deserves what he gets.

To try to salve our consciences, we do various
favors for these fallen men once we've made
sure they are a safe distance away. We go out
of our way to explain to other schools (which
inquire about the circumstances of the depar-
ture of our fallen men) that we, Washington and
Lee, are special—we treat honor violators se-

verely so we may maintain our strict code of
honor. Just because a student is compelled by
us to leave, is no indication that he is forever
dishonorable. Favorite professors of the rejected
student may write letters of recommendation for
him. Perhaps it is easier for us to sleep at night
once these things are done.

It seems strange to us, therefore, that when we are
willing to do so very much to help some of these
fallen men once they’ve gone, we remain unwilling
to reach a little deeper into the cup of compassion and
grant that fallen man a chance to redeem himself—to
redeem himself here in our midst, where it will count
the most. But ah, yes—if we let these fallen men back,
the honor system will weaken. It will crumble over the
years by slow erosion. It would be like inviting can-
cer to come back again after the operation to remove it
has been completed. So we must stand firm.

Well—in a way, we admire the students, professors,
and administration officials who have conditioned their
hearts to the extent that they can accept this situation.
We know it’s not very easy at times for anyone—
especially for those students who must hear the cases
and pronounce the sentence. But please, don’t be too
hard on us because we, somehow, can’t bring ourselves
to place a rigid system above the eternally wavering,
often weak, but ever worthy human soul.

 

Honor System Fraught With Inqustice

The most significant and most valuable student
institution at Washington and Lee is the honor system.
As the catalogue says, “the honor system is not some-
thing to which only lip service is paid.” Confidence
that one’s class standing is valid; confidence that a
mis-placed coat will stay in the spot where it is left;
confidence, as a professor, that all students’ work is
honorable—this is only part of the crop of advantages
which we reap from our honor system.

But we believe there are a few aspects of this sys-
tem which should be carefully examined—and, per-
haps, modified. We hope none of the many members of
the W&L community who have come to cherish the
honor system will begrudge us the opportunity for
such an examination. We do not wish to direct a bar-
rage of useless criticism at what is certainly Wé&L’s
greatest tradition, on the contrary, we hope our sug-
gestions will help to strengthen an honor system which
has come under serious question by some members
of this student body.

The Executive Committee operates the honor
system under the assumption that honor is an
“absolute.” A former EC member believed that
since the man who steals an orange and the man
who steals a wallet both go through the same
thought processes in deciding to steal, they both
deserve the same punishment under our system.
We question the absoluteness of honor. We be-
lieve there are degrees of honor. And this is the
crux of the dispute.

There is a big difference between the student who,
without any premeditation, impulsively cheats on a
quiz, and a student who deliberately and cold-blooded-
ly steals money from his roommate over a long period
of time. The action of the first student is essentially
out-of-character—he acted without thinking about his
action; the second student’s actions, on the other hand,
are an integral part of his character. Thus, the degree
of honor which is sacrificed by the first student is con-
siderably less than that which is lost by the second
student.

Once we realize that there are degrees of honor,
then we must logically conclude that there should be
degrees of punishment. But our honor system has

only one punishment—the maximum one. As late as
1820, England issued the death penalty in over 200
different crimes; as late as 1964, Washington and Lee
issues its own capital punishment, and it does so
arbitrarily, with no thought whatsoever given to the

essential, over-riding character of the violator. W&L’s
fallen man may have cheated under circumstances of |:
extreme emotional stress and after giving his action |:
no previous thought; or, he may have been systemat- | >
ically, deliberately cheating over a period of months— |‘

but we place both students in the same category.

Last year a student who sat on the EC for two
years said: “From my experience, I believe that
there are few premeditated honor offenses com-
mitted here. Most occur in a moment of thought-
Jessness or because the student has not taken
time to familiarize himself with the rules as they
apply to a particular course.” If we are to be just
at W&L, we must allow a flexibility in the ad-
ministration of our honor system which will pro-
vide for such students.

Those students who oppose any penalty less than
permanent expulsion say that if we suspend certain
violators for a year, and then allow them to return,
we will make a “punitive system” out of the honor
system. Let us not delude ourselves. From the moment
a student is expelled from W&L on an honor viola-
tion, the system becomes punitive—indeed, it punishes
the student with a penalty most extreme. And long
after we, who allowed that student to be expelled,
have forgotten his name and his face, he will have to
live with the emotional, psychological, and academic
consequences of his expulsion,

Other opponents of a one-year suspension penalty
imply that to allow the fallen man to come back would
be to endanger the rest of the student body—the faith-
ful. It is rank foolishness to believe that the purity of
the rest of W&L’s students would be in jeopardy if an
honor violator were allowed to associate with them
once again. It is about time that the inflexible judges
who have laughed in scorn for one full year at the
suggestion that our honor system is too extreme and
too rigid begin to take seriously what is certainly
W&L’s most serious and flagrant injustice to its stu-
dents.

 

The Risks In A Goldwater Nomination

Last week in an article which summarized Sen.
Barry Goldwater’s current strength, Time Magazine
estimated that he will have at least 550 delegates on
the first ballot going into July’s GOP convention. That
tally does not include California, nor any favorite son
states, nor any “at large” delegates whose sympathy
may lie with Goldwater but who are remaining un-
committed for the time being.

For example, Time does not include Kentucky's 18
convention votes on its tally for Goldwater because
it assumes Thruston Morton will be a favorite son on
the first ballot. Our Steering Committee was told
Morton would not hold back his delegation even on the
first ballot, and thus Time’s estimate could be 568,
and still be conservative. Time awarded Goldwater no
votes at all in states like Massachusetts, Michigan,
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Washington and West Vir-
ginia, where we know there are between three and
ten Goldwater delegates at least.

Although there are numerous states in which Time's
estimates are two or three votes lower than ours there
are some others in which Time gave Goldwater sub-
stantially more votes than we did: in Illinois, Time
gave him 47 while we gave him 36; in Missouri, Time
gave him 20 while we gave him 12; and, we awarded
Arkansas’ 12 votes to Winthrop Rockefeller on the
first ballot, but Time gives them to Goldwater.

It thus appears that if our first ballot total
was high—as many people think it was—it was
not very high, probably not more than 10 or 15
votes. Our convention was indisputably right in-

sofar as it tried to reflect the present status of the
Republican candidates, and particularly the dele-
gate-strength of Barry Goldwater. There were,
however, some rather disappointing shortcomings
to the convention.

One such shortcoming was the refusal—explicit and
vocal—on the part of some state chairmen to even
attempt to interpret the effect on their states of Cal-
ifornia’s support of Gov. Nelson Rockefeller. We can-
not be sure what will happen in California on June
2, but we know that it will be a turning point one
way or the other for Goldwater. As Time reported:
“Goldwater has placed his political prestige squarely
on the line in California, to the point of saying that if
he does not win in California, he doesn’t deserve the
nomination. Thus, a California loss might cause second
thoughts in the minds of some delegates who presently
favor Goldwater.”

In the Arizona Senator’s own opinion, therefore,
we should not have nominated him. The reason we
went ahead and did so anyway might be a lack of fore-
sight on the part of some state chairmen, or it might
be the lack of fluidity which characterizes Goldwater
backers, or it might be a sincere but rebellious re-
fusal to believe the decision we made on California
was the correct one. In short, our convention was me-
chanically perfect as a mirror of the present; as a fore-
cast of the future—which it is supposed to be—it may
have been a little short-sighted.

We must keep in mind one thing: Barry

The ’64 Mock Convention in Retrospect

 

By WYATT E. DURRETTE, JR.

In the political aftermath of the
Mock Convention one question,
above all others, is significant: were
we right? All
other issues—can
he beat LBJ? is
he the most pop-
ular Republican?
will the party
unite behind him?
etc—are irrelevant
except as they
bear on the accur-
acy of our deter-
mination.

In my opinion
we are right. And
the confirmation next July will add
the final star to the crown of a
convention that J, among untold
others, consider a resounding suc-
cess.

Primarily, I believe we are right
because of the immeasurable confi-
dence I have in 53 talented and
hard-working individuals, who as
state chairmen, studied assiduously
for almost a year the trends and
developments in their states in order
to cast their votes on May 5. But
most of them were not satisfied with
their own judgment, as a look at
the telephone records will tell you;
so they sought instructions from

 

Durrette

party “pros” in all parts of the

 

country.

Numerous phone calls were made
in an effort to re-evaluate states
which might be affected by the out-
come of the California primary. In
fact there were less than 10 state
chairmen who failed to seek tele-
phone evaluations between the an-
nouncement of the California and
Oregon requests and the end of the
balloting on Tuesday.

In the May 8th issue of Time mag-
azine a projection of Goldwater's
delegate strength was attempted.
And as the article stressed, “the
canvass, based on conversations with
state and county Republican leaders
over a national telephone network,
was deliberately cautious: where-
ever a delegate’s loyalty was in
doubt, his vote was not counted in
Goldwater’s column.” The following
was the listing of 29 states and their
first ballot votes which totaled 550
for Goldwater. For the same 29 states
our state chairmen gave the Arizona
Senator only 524 first ballot votes.

CBS News Prediction

On Wednesday night CBS news
after a nation-wide canvass of their
correspondents predicted that Gold-
water would have a minimum of
564 first ballot votes, and they ac-
knowledged that this was most prob-
ably low.

Both of the above were without
California.

 

Convention Estimation Is Defended

Following his speech at VMI Fri-
day night, the AP correspondent
who has been covering Goldwater’s
campaign told me that barring de-
velopments which no one could now
foresee, he felt certain that we were
correct.

In the light of these facts and
many others too numerous to men-
tion, it seems childish and vindictive
to suggest, as some are doing, that
personal sentiment of steering com-
mittee members or state chairmen .
guided or influenced this selection.
Anyone who is capable of being ob-
jective realizes that this is patently
absurd.

Convention Was Beyond Emotion

If we are wrong, and I do not
think we are, it is because we were
honest, objective and diligent. It is
because the state chairmen followed
their consciences, their minds and
their instructions from Party Lead-
ers—not their personal emotions.
And if this made us wrong we need
apologize to no one.

Political predictions is a_ risky
business, but the record of W&L’s
suecess is an enviable one. I have
every confidence that this July in
San Francisco our choice will be
confirmed, and those who contrib-
uted to this monumental task can
be proud of their role in extending
our record to 9 for 13.

 

“If you don’t like things the way
they are here, why don’t you go
someplace else where you'll be more
happy?” This attitude, so often ex-
pressed here at Washington and Lee
is perhaps the most dangerous enemy
that can plague the academy.

For a university’s success or fail-
ure depends on the extent to which
it challenges the minds of its stu-
dents to confront new, often un-
palatable ideas. And it follows that
the success of a student’s own edu-
cation depends on the extent to
which he is willing to take up the
challenge and expose himself to “the
other side.”

If there is no dissent, or if, as
is increasingly the case here, the
dissent is ignored or suffocated by
paternalistic nodding, there can be
no opportunity for growth and
flexibility in the minds of students,
and inquiry succumbs to sterile
stability.

Again and again we are told that
Washington and Lee is a conserva-

 

tive institution, and indeed it is, to

 

A Look at Washington and Lee

 

the marrow of its alleged bones.
Here the status quo is a way of life.
Here enthusiasm, eccentricity, and
dissent share the same trash can.
Honor is absolute. Coats and ties
make the gentleman. If we ignore
the integration problem long enough
maybe it will go away. Lee’s in his
tomb and all’s right with the world.
Who are we kidding?

How easy it is for us to blindly
aecept “time-tested” formulas, the
worn cliches, and believe they are
the best. But are they really time
tested? No concept can be tested
without criticism, and yet our tra-
dition-bound, monolithic attitude in-
creasingly makes any attempts at
criticism worthless folly.

The point I'm trying to empha-
size is that dissent for the sake of
dissent is not only acceptable, but
vital and necessary. We need more,
not less, gadflies. We need to put
ourselves and our beliefs on the

assume that we are getting any,
kind of an education at Washing-
ton and Lee?

Those who merely pay lip-serv-
ice to our traditions and _ beliefs,
without seeking the inward dispo-
sition that alone can make them
meaningful obviously don’t love
this University. For love implies the
courage to submit our beliefs to
criticism and judgment, and any be-
liefs incapable of standing in the
face of criticism are simply not
worth holding.

We must realize that the motive
for dissent is concern, not scorn,
The true dissenter, like the phy-
sician, seeks only to exercise
what is infectious, to nurture what
is good and healthy and ultimately,
to heal.

Unless we are all bold enough to
give honesty a new birth of free-
dom, ten years from now Wash-
ington and Lee will still be a small,
white, men’s “liberal arts” college
nestled snugly in the Shenandoah
Valley. Nestled? No, buried....

“Fellini’s 842” begins next Sun-
day at the Lyric. It is director
Federico Fellini’s story about a di-
rector directing a movie. “Paris
When It Sizzles” is writer George
Axelrod’s story about a writer writ-
ing a film script. It is supposed to
start tomorrow but probably won’t.

Perhaps it is unfair to write about
“815”, comparing it to “Paris When
It Sizzles.” Certainly the latter is
much less entertaining, much less
imaginative, and much less brilliant
than the former. However, since the
approach is somewhat similar there
is room for comparison.

Director Analyses Profession

“814” has been called, and prob-
ably is, a personal statement by
Fellini about his profession. The di-
rector in “8144” is named Guido and
is played by Marcello Mastroianni.
The film is made up of a series of
sequences, some actual experiences,
some dreams, and some memories. It
begins with an eerie dream which
Guido is having, wherein he is about
to suffocate in a car, while people
all around him watch, some indif-
ferent, some interested, some occu-
pied in a world of their own.

All these people watching are
people who are in contact with
Guido in the real world. This scene
may well be the key to the entire
movie.

The story is simple. Guido has

‘Draft Heinzerling’ Move Begun,
SAE’s Announce A Favorite Son

The general principal that students
become more apathetic and con-
servative as they get older may be
true, but at least there is one ex-
ception. John Z. Heinzerling, a
senior who will return to law school
next year, is branching out into the
new activity of town politics.

The SAE house has announced
the opening of the “Draft John Z.
Heinzerling for Mayor” campaign
headquarters. The campaign was
kicked off during the Mock Con-
vention, and is being managed by
L. Dickinson Barker.

At a press conference yesterday
Barker told his interviewers that
Lexington needs fresh blood in of-
fice, and that now is the time to do
it. He reminded the listeners that
in the upeoming elections the race
will be wide open, since ex-Mayor

 

Holstein has become a judge, and
the temporary mayor, Pat Brady of
W&cL, has expressed great reluctance
to run in the race.

Heinzerling, says Barker, is not
so reluctant. He has promised to run
if he feels the draft movement is
“sincere and honest.”

Heinzerling’s support thus far
seems to be coming from a promi-
nent group of senior citizens who
have been his associates since he
came to Washington and Lee. This
is Heinzerling’s fifth year at W&L,
and he seems to have a thorough
grasp of Lexington’s problems by
now.

Heinzerling’s platform is unclear
but there have been rumors that he
favors a crash program to enlarge
ABC facilities.

Michaeles, Frost, Bowersox
Star Against Towson

By TOM CARPENTER
Tuesday Sports Columnist

The Washington and Lee lacrosse
team guaranteed itself a winning
season Saturday by nipping Tow-
son, 5-4, on the victor’s field. John-
ny McDaniel, W&lL’s potential All-
American sticker, paced the Gen-
erals’ attack with three goals as
they prepped for the season’s big
game Thursday against University
of Virginia at Charlottesville.

The Cavaliers have only a 5-5
record this season, but have lost to
five of the top teams in the country
and have beaten Maryland, who now
is the proud owner of a 10-3 mark.
The Generals will carry a 5-3 record
into the game.

The Wahoos are paced by their
little midfielder Snowdy Hoff, one of
the many Baltimore residents on
the team. Hoff has been called the
“heart” of the UVa. team by the
coaches of the opposition. He ap-*
pears to be their best bet for All-
American this season.

Virginia Is Big

Virginia has been inconsistent this
year, partly because of injuries. Dar-
rell, one of the best men on the
squad, will not play against the
Generals, Tuesday because of a bad
leg.

The Cavaliers are not blessed with
a great goalie, but make up for his
deficinces with a strong defense. The
defensemen are big, as are the at-
tackmen. Virginia is experienced and
a good passing club, They will use
numerous formations on offense to
keep the defense off balance.

Good Defense Saturday

The Generals displayed the de-
fense Saturday that should handle
the Wahoos’ offense fairly well, as
they held Towson to only four goals.
Pete Noonan did an outstanding job
in the goal.

Mike Michaeles and Bob Frost
added one goal each to McDaniel’s
three Jay Bowersox played an out-
standing game, recovering 13 ground
balls and controlling a vast majority
of the face-offs.

Congratulations to the Friday
Sports Section!! You’ve done it
again, boys.

Last week you reported that
there were FIVE teams in the
CAC, but your cartoon (and I
still fail to see exactly what it
is implying) shows only four of
the conference members. Is
Southwestern up inside the bell,
or are they just out buying beer
for the rest of the members.

If you boys keep up this good
work (“Better Sports News”)
maybe you'll soon get paid like
you said the W&L lacrosse team
was going to do to Towson.

Gasque, Essex, Mynttinen
Win; Runners Place Third
In 2nd CAC Tournament

By JIM CROTHERS
Tuesday Sports Editor

Gay Gasque, promising freshman
track star, led Washington and Lee
to a close third place finish in track
at the CAC tourney Saturday by
breaking both the conference and
W&L school records in the shot-put
with a toss of 48 9 3/4”.

Shot Put Record

Gasque’s record breaking put
came on his last attempt and edged
the former conference champ,
George Norwich, by 3/4 of an
inch. Rick Mynttinen and Skip
Essex also helped the Generals’
cause with first in the javelin and
440-yard run respectively. Mynttin-
en’s winning toss of 175 feet was
just five feet from the record, while
Essex’s 51.0 run missed the record
by half a second.

As in the overall conference stand-
ings, Washington University ran
away with track competition, win-
ning easily over Sewanee, the clos-
est competitor, 119-58. Washington
and Lee edged Southwestern, 36-33,
for the third spot, with Centre fin-
ishing last with 16 points.

Injuries Hurt

Other track and field men who
supported the W&L cause—depleted
by the loss of the Kell brothers, out
with pulled ,muscles—were Hank
Hendrickson, who placed third in
the javelin; Jim Thompson, who
had a third in the 880-yard race; and
John Graham, who was edged by
two Washington U. record breakers
and had to settle for a third place
in the pole vault.

Generals Finish With 65
Behind Sewanee, and S.W.

Several bad breaks, injuries to
key participants, and too much aca-
demic work hampered Washington
and Lee in the second annual Col-
lege Athletic Conference spring
sports festival, and the Generals had
to be content with a last-place tie
in the final conference standings.

Washington University of St. Louis
repeated last year’s sweep and
walked off with the coveted CAC
bell. Washington U.’s point total of
125 put them well ahead of the near-
est competitor, Sewanee, whose
overall total was 100, and South-
western, close behind the Tigers
with a point output of 95.

W&L and Centre tied for the last
position, both scoring a total of 65
points throughout the year. Con-
ference points are accumulated in
six sports—football, basketball, track,
baseball, tennis and golf—with the
| winners of each individual sport
earning a replica of the bell trophy.

Jay Clark Is Initiated
Into Debate Fraternity

John W. Clark, Phi Gam Senior,
has been named Washington and
Lee’s first initiate into Tau Kappa
Alpha-Delta Sigma Rho honorary
debate fraternity.

Formerly initiated students out-
standing in the forensics into Tau
Kappa Alpha, but that fraternity was
merged this year with Delta Sigma
Rho, which was a separate frater-
nity of similar nature.

Clark has debated at W&L for
four years, and twice has_ been
elected captain of the debate team.
He was a member of two state
championship teams, and another
year was recognized as the out-
standing speaker at the state meet.

The holder of a Robert E. Lee Re-
search grant in debating, Clark has
also served in an advisory capacity
to underclassmen in the debate pro-
gram. Clark is a Dean’s List stu-
dent majoring in history. His home
is in Birmingham, Alabama.

Requirements for membership in
Tau Kappa Alpha-Delta Sigma Rho
are outstanding achievement in de-
bating during at least two year, and
a scholastic standing in the upper
third of the class.

THE RING-TUM PHI

The Risks In A Goldwater Nomination

(Continued from page 2)

Goldwater is not acceptable to all Republicans.
Some _ professional Republicans—Sen. Jacob
Javits notably—have flatly declared they will
not support a Goldwater candidacy. Goldwater
backers may blandly say that their man could
care less—or, they may say that in the end all
Republicans will swing behind Barry. We pre-
dict that with Goldwater running, many Repub-
licans will just stay home on election day, and
that many influential members of the GOP will
be making no efforts to get their constituents to
support the party.

Most important is the fact the GOP professionals
are not giving up—they want to win. As Marquis
Childs said last week, “Astute men like Ohio’s Ray
Bliss want to win. They are not happy at the thought
of either suicide or of a wrecking operation with the
wreckers controlling the party machinery. The Amer-
ican press has treated Goldwater unmercifully. His
supporters laugh at Walter Lippmann and Joseph
Alsop, but the fact remains that those two men, among

 

others, have done an excellent job of making many
voters “scared to death” of the Arizonian. And when
a popular medium like television and a popular pro-
gram like “That Was the Week that Was” bitterly sat-
irizes a candidate (Goldwater was named the man who
would make the worst president by TW-3 last week),
Republicans need to face up to the fact that if Gold-
water is nominated, he will be massacred in Novem-
ber.

A humiliating defeat of Goldwater might mean the
loss of several important GOP seats in the House and
Senate. That in turn would mean the passage of some
legislation which no Republican wants. There would
be no way to stop it. We suggest that it is about time
some Goldwater people stopped thinking so much
about their candidate and conservatism, and _ start
thinking about their party, and the beating it will take
in November if Goldwater runs. The American two-
party system is weak enough as it is; unless the Gold-
water camp backs away from “Barry or secession”
and excepts a representative candidate, the GOP may
lose a lot of its waning power.

 

‘Paris When It Sizzles’

(Continued from page 2)

appear that Fellini has merely
tricked his audience into allowing
him to place these innocuous scenes
of his memory before them. Indeed,
as I sat through it the first time,
this began to occur to me,

Yet the main story is about his
own life, about the trials of being
an artist, in particular a motioi. pic-
ture director, and the difficulty that
lies in trying to make a film one
man’s personal statement. Yet in
presenting this, Fellini succeeds in
doing exactly what the director in

 

the film is unable to do. His film |
is a major landmark in the cinema; |
it is a director’s movie, and must be
considered one of the real master-!|
pieces of cinema.

Unfortunately, “Paris When It}
Sizzles” is not. Axelrod is playing a|
funny joke on the movie-going pub- |
lic. William Holden plays a seript|
writer who must write a movie|
script in 24 hours. Audrey Hepburn

is his assistant. The audience is taken
through a miriad of plots all de-
signed to bring the hero and heroine
together for a last scene kiss despite
seemingly insurmountable odds.

The joke is obvious. While we
watch Holden and Hepburn write
this script intended to bring the
actor Holden and the actress Hep-
burn together, Axelrod is slowly
bringing the real actor Holden and
actress Hepburn together. The idea
itself is somewhat clever and much
of the movie is too. Yet too often
we are taken on some useless and
unfunny diversion, put in only as
filler. If this too is part of the joke, *
then it is a bad one. Perhaps, though,
the funniest thing about the movie is

| the fact that simply because Holden

and Hepburn are in it, it will be a
smashing box-office success. And
because no matter what you may
think of the merit of the film, George
and William and Audrey will all
have the last and loudest laugh.

AN OPEN LETTER |

TO THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN OF

SOUTHAMPTON’S DEBUTANTE PARTY

WE READ A STATEMENT in the Press made by’
one of the young defendants after the court
case involving alleged damages at a debutante
party in Southampton, Long Island: “Every-
one knows there is too much drinking in this
country, but what can you do about it? Every-
body knows the morals of this country are
going down the drain.”

WE THE UNDERSIGNED believe we have the
answer to the young man’s question.

We believe it is time our generation stopped
self-righteously deploring this state of the
nation or irresponsibly contributing to it. The,
time has come to change it.

REPRESENT hunvdreds of young Americans
across the nation who have committed their
lives to create a new society in America and
the world with the global program of Moral
Re-Armament.

WE ARE IN REVOLT against a society which cre-
ates the climate of immaturity and lawless-
ness that leads to such a debacle and to such a
cynical statement. We have got to stop it.

WE ARE IN REVOLT against the gutlessness of
1 “good” Americans who lack the courage to
4 explode the corruption existing in all levels of
our society, who sit silently while one woman
| forces God out of our schools, who permit men
a8 committed to atheism and anti-God to proceed
7 unchecked, who proclaim one set of standards

and live another.

WE ARE IN REVOLT against the line of the “new
morality” which is forced down our throats
by books, magazines, television, films, profes-
sors and some churchmen. Sex, violence, lust
and godlessness are taking over the nation.
When venereal disease among young Ameri-
cans rises 130% between the years 1956 and
1961, when 18,000,000 children come from
broken homes—who is responsible? We are.

{

WHERE ARE THE YOUNG AMERICANS who
will pay the price in their own lives to stand

up for what is right in the country? Where

are the fighting Americans who will cure the
hatred, bitterness, impurity and selfishness

WE

 

 

| which divide families, destroy races, deaden
youth, split nations?

‘THE FREE WORLD looks to us for leadership. :
The captive world looks to us to make freedom Bi
a reality again. We know that if America fails
the world fails.

WE ARE OUT TO BUILD A NATION where fami-
lies teach mankind how to live together, where
industry management and labor—teach the
whole world how to work together, where all
races, colors and classes learn together with
all nations how to lead the whole world for-
ward. We are out to create a force of young
Americans more dedicated to building a world
that works than any Communist or material-
ist. We will create an America to whom the
whole world will turn and say, “That is the
way men are meant to live.”

WE BELIEVE IN MODERN AMERICA. We be-
lieve she will rise to the challenge of the times.
We believe she will demonstrate the great re-
ality that free men will accept of their own
accord the discipline to be governed by God,
so that millions on the earth will never be
ruled by tyrants.

THE CHALLENGE facing the American youth is
not to go backward to the decadence that de-
stroyed the Roman Empire, but to go forward
to the revolution of Moral Re-Armament.

WE CAN REBUILD THE MODERN WORLD. Let p
us go forward to absolute moral standards for :
all men everywhere: absolute honesty, purity,
unselfishness and love, not as an end in them-
selves, but as a means for giving us the en-
ergy, the maturity, the responsibility, the
clarity that will take humanity forward to the
next stage in human evolution.

THREE THOUSAND OF US are meeting this sum-
mer in a Conference for Tomorrow’s America
at the Moral Re-Armament Center, Mackinac
Island, Michigan, to shoulder that task to-
gether. We invite every young American who
has the courage and spirit to care for his na-
tion and the future of mankind to join us,

Debaters Select
Tri- Captains

Sam Frazier, Ed Fitzgerald, and
Rick Kneipper were named _ today
by debate coach William Chaffin as
the tri-captains of next year’s team.

The debate team closed out its
year Wednesday night with a din-
ner here. Alan Cohen and Bill
Grant were named the Outstanding
Freshman Debaters. Bill Noell, Al
Eckes, Jay Clark, Pete Straub,
Ed Norton and Jack Eure were
also honored for what Chaffin de-
scribed as being “pioneers of the
debate program at Washington and
Lee.”

Chaffin called the graduating sen-
iors the “end of a golden era.” It
was four years ago that Chaffin
came to Lexington and set up the
debate program. Since that time
W&L teams have risen to national
prominence, culminated by last
year’s appearance at the National
Finals.

“These six men have carried us
a long way and we're expecting
to go even further with the material
which is now available at W&L.
However, it must be remembered
that these men were largely re-
sponsible for creating the interest
which has acted as the stimulus for
debating here.”

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi
Friday Edition
Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

 

“te Other Side Of The Coin

The Tuesday Edition of the Ring-tum Phi expressed some
concern over the ‘injustices” existing in the Honor System.
Our curiosity being aroused, we thought it best to consult with
those who are most intimately connected with the workings of
that System. Why is it that the members of the Executive Com-
mittee, those best understanding both the workings and the
effects of the Honor System, are consistently so adamant in

its defense?

In order to best answer this question, we investigated the
reasons which lead the Executive Committee to maintain the
Honor System as it now stands. Their opinion is doubtless the

most valid and authoritative.

It is, first of all, unrealistic to expect the EC to judge
whether a man is basically dishonest or not, or whether one
dishonest person is more dishonest than another. How can
they know whether a person who has cheated “impulsively”
on one test has not done so innumerable times? Is it fair to
leave such a subjective and unanswerable question up to the

EC?

Certainly the EC doesn’t judge any cases where the evi-
dence supplied is insufficient or indefinite. The individual mem-
bers of the Committee go through a great deal of personal
soul-searching and careful examination of the evidence before
they pass a verdict on any accused student, realizing the severi-
ty of of the penalty. The result is that it will not pronounce
a student guilty unles it is sure beyond any doubt that its deci-

sion is valid.

Before the incoming student reaches W&L he is fully in-
formed of the workings of the system, its consequences, and
its benefits. The Honor System is emphasized again at fresh-
man camp and during the first week of classes. All students
know what W&L’s Honor System is and how it operates. There
is no doubt in their minds of the consequences of a breach

of the honor code.

The Honor System is an integral part of the meaning
of Washington and Lee University. We are now one of the
few schools in the country where the Honor System has worked
with such effective results. We are known throughout the coun-
try for our workable system of maintaining honor. Because it
is one chief reason why many students come to W&L and be-
cause it is such a deeply meaningful institution, we certainly
should not jeopardize this status.

It must be remembered that expulsion from W&L is not
the same as capital punishment. Students who are expelled
from W&L are able to gain admission to other fine universities,

such as Tulane or Dartmouth.

The Honor System as it presently stands has the
ability to maintain a sense of honor and dignity. Any-
thing that would mitigate this ability would be detri-
mental, if not fatal, to the Honor System. A weaker
Honor System might result in no Honor System at all

In conclusion, we must agree with the Tuesday Edition
that the Honor System is rigid. However, it is this very
rigidity that has put our university in a class by itself as far
as the average Honor System is concerned.

In considering the Honor System, we must not
dwell merely on its negative aspect. Indeed, the issue of
the “fallen man” sinks to an infintestimal level of un-
importance when we consider the benefits that are de-
rived from W&L’s most living tradition.

Eight & A Half’ Presents
A Self Portrait Of Fellini

By BOB MOTTLEY

Frederico Fellini’s 84% opens Sun-
day at the Lyric; it is fitting to be
able to devote all of this last
column of the semester to one of the
very greatest per-
sonal _testaments
ever issued by
any artist in any
aesthetic medium.

Fellini tells the
story of one
Guido  Anselmi,
an internationally
known Italian
cinema director
who has reached
a period of artist-
ic frigidity. He
goes to a famous vacation center
noted for its thermal baths, where
he tries to “find himself.” This is
made rather difficult by the presence
of virtually his entire retinue of ac-
tors, technicians, public relations
men, lawyers, and assorted parasites
all hoping to be a part of his new
film.

Unfortunately, Anselmi is as
much in the dark as they are
about what his new movie will be,
although his producer is also vat
this spa, constantly prodding him
and telling him to get on with it,
to get something in the can. The
director’s mistress is along for

   

Mottley

 

fun and games, and even his wife
eventually turns up, although she
is surprisingly tolerant (by Ameri-
can standards) of her husband’s
observance of that good, old-
fashioned Double Standard.
Caught between ennui and apathy,
Anselmi frees himself from the
assorted frustrations at hand by
clever daydreams, He is caught in
a traffic jam, and then arises from
his car like a god to his hotel
bed.

A particularly obnoxious writer
makes one suggestion too many
and—in the director’s dream—is
hanged on the spot! (A device that
might be imitated with profit in
Hollywood). These dreams are very
much a part of the film’s fabric, and,
in the end, Anselmi learns to live
with his past and with the dramatis
personae of his life dancing around
him as if in a cireus ring. In the
love-filled final scene, his people
(wife, mistress, actors, technicans
even writers) become his perform-
ers, and he makes his aesthetic
peace with his artistic self.

Breathtaking to Watch

One does not have to know so
much of what is said in 8% as what
is done. The film is breathtaking to
watch, a virtuosic tour de force of
the first order. So fluid does the

Durrette Analyzes Tuesday Editorial

 

By WYATT DURRETTE

In Tuesday’s Ring-tum Phi the
editorial “The Risks in a Goldwater
nomination” is addressed to several
points, two of which require fur-
their comment and analysis.

First is the assertion that since
California’s primary had been won
by Rockefeller we should not have
“in the Arizona Senator’s own
opinion. ..nominated him.”

California

As the editorial indicated Gold-
water did place his political pres-
tige on the line in California. But
this was on the assumption that
Governor Rockfeller and his sup-
porters would conduct a campaign
befitting a presidential aspirant; he
assumed that his record and his
ideas would be the subject of honest
debate and not the victim of the
“Big Lie” and bought votes.

But his assumptions are false.
Governor Rockefeller with the as-
sistance of Spencer-Roberts—the
biggest and best public relations
firm in the political campaign
buisness—have adopted tactics
designed to win no matter the
price: in dollars, in careers, or
in integrity,

Without great elaboration one tac-
tic should suffice to sound the
nature of their methodology. Spen-
cer-Roberts & Co. successfully re-

By KEN McGRAW

There are a number of things
which are synonymous with Spring
at W&L, but none is any more
closely associated with it than the
White’s Farm Carnival.

The carnival itself belongs to the
Borelli brothers, Jim and Louis
(neither of which is Tanya’s hus-
band despite popular opinion). Both
are very amiable people as is their
manager, Mr. Lewis. Mr. Lewis has

 

 

registered over 70,000 Negroes from
Democratic to Republican in order
that they could vote for Governor
Rockefeller on June 2.

If this and other similar tac-
tics, including a gigantic smear
campaign, should succeed in de-
feating Goldwater in California he
would hardly conclude that he
does not deserve the nomination.

It is my understanding that less
than 200 delegates remain to be
chosen after the June 2 primary. A
Rockefeller victory in California
could, depending on the state, have
an impact on these selections. But
as to the ones already picked, and
those to be chosen between now
and then, the influence of it is
speculative.

From conversations with Mock
Convention state chairmen I have
concluded that most of those
whose states are questionable made
every effort to assimilate the Cal-
ifornia results with their other
findings. Many telephoned and
asked directly: “How will a Rock-
efeller victory in California af-
fect my state’s voting?”

I am not sufficiently appraised
of the situation state by state to
know in which state or states we
were worn, if at all. But I vigorous-
ly disagree with the intimation that
our state chairmen intentionally

had the misfortune though of spend-
ing forty-seven years of his life in
work that he doesn’t enjoy—the
carnival. “There is one good thing
about it though,” he said, “I’ve spent
forty-seven years of my life in this
business, started out in Richmond
in 1916 with a job in concessions,
I sold hotdogs then, and I have
never once had to work for any-
one but myself.”

New Skin Show

By DREW BAUR

Oh, joy, the skin show is here.
My, there are some choice goodies
this year.

The most obvious change to the
casual observer is the addition of
a third show. Since this show is
the newest, it would be best to
give it the initial analysis. The act
is longer, the jokes are better, but
the girlies are worse. Vicky was
a welcome addition with her sen-
suous curves, but hardly in a class
with the sexy Tanya or the sultry
Faye. Of the other three, one looked
faintly like the chief prop in the
flick Moby Dick; one appeared to
have spent a good deal of time
under the knife, and the third prob-
ably remembers voting for William
Jennings Bryan.

The worst of the shows is a one
beast operation run by Stella the
Blond Bombshell, a real piece of
donkey. Her subtle approach to the
strip leaves most onlookers non-
chalantly tossing their proverbial
cookies, instead of leaping up and
down with excitement.

Most people save the leaping for
Tanya. In two years she has estab-

 

 

Added To Fair;

Vicky Not In A Class With Tanya

lished herself as a legend in these
parts with her sexy dance and good
looks. It is not necessary to go into
a more detailed description. This
year Tanya was joined full time by
Faye, a voluptuous redhead who has
adorned the pages of the Southern
Collegian. She has acquired far more
poise in the past year, but is not
yet quite as promiscuous as the
talented, well-endowed Tanya.
Flick Team

The time has come to choose the
1963-1964 All-Star Flick Team. This
year four flickers stood out so far
above all the rest that it would be
unfair to place anyone in the same
catageory with them. The first All-
Star is the nortorious Kappa Sig,
Tom Pace, who leger.d claims, went
to New York for three days, saw
nine flicks and returned. Two D.C,
flickers, Frank Wright, a Sigma Nu,
and PiKA, Dick Goode, join Alan
Hubbard, a KA junior, to round out
a balanced squad.

Goldwater—Victim Of The

failed to evaluate their states in
light of the California decision.
They could, you know, be right—
mechanically and predictively.

Acceptable to All?
Second, I will examine the asser-
tion that Goldwater is “not accept-
able to all Republicans.” Who is?
Was John Kennedy acceptable to
“all” Democrats?

That New York Senator Jacob
Javits will not support Senator
Goldwater is not surprising, but
Javits is hardly a representative
of a significant body of Republicans.
He has the lowest ACA (conserva-
tive) voting percentage of any Re-
publican Senator and is one of 7
with a percentage below 50 per
cent. These 7 have the dubious dis-
tinction of accompanying 54 Dem-
ocrats in the less that 50 per cent
club. While only 4 Democrats rate
above 70 per cent, 12 Republicans,
including Senator Goldwater, stand
above this mark.

It does not, then, seem particu-
larly disturbing that Senator Javitts’
affections may be alienated by Gold-
water’s nomination as he represents
a small minority of Republicans.

Polls—Chaos or Certainty?
What about the polls? In April,
1963 the Gallup Poll reported that
Governor Rockefeller was the fav-
orite of 43 per cent of the Repub-
licans; by November, 1963 Senator

Three Artistic ‘Burlesque Reviews’ Offer
Entertainment at Annual Carnival Visit

relli's and Mr. Lewis begins in
April. Starting in South Carolina
they work their way north to Penn-
sylvania. By this time it is August
and time for the carnival to go back
south for its November closing in
Nacoy, Florida. The reason that
Lexington is on their schedule is
that it is a convenient stopping
place. Mr. Borelli hastened to add
though that he certainly didn’t mind
stopping the carnival here, because
the students were pretty good cus-
tomers, This statement brought us
back to the topic of the skin show.
He couldn’t estimate the amount
students spend at these shows, but
it seems logical to me that if you
multiplied 1200 by three you would
be pretty close.

For those who are waiting until
the last minute to go, there are
three “strip shows” and seven girls.
The Borelli’s object, though, to the
title of strip show. “It’s not a strip
show” said Mr. Borelli. “It’s a re-
view, burlesque. There’s an art to it.
The dance that these girls do is a
form of expression, there’s nothing
cheap about it. A perfect woman’s
body is a beautiful thing,” he con-
tinued. “Take the Mona Lisa, for
example. Why do you think every-
body raves about her?” I answered
Mr. Borelli that I might just be
unappreciative, but that the sight of
four of the seven of those girls
wasn’t very appealing to any of
my senses, especially not the
aesthetic one,

Girl’s Married

By way of general information
on these girls, Mr. Borelli added
that all of them were married.
When asked if their husbands
didn’t mind, he seemed to think that
it was a ridiculous question to ask.
He answered me by asking if a wife
of a plumber minds the fact that
her husband works in toilet bowls.

Another very interesting man to
talk to out at the fair is Lou Pease.
He and his wife Kitty run the show
featuring the legless, armless, bone-
less creature. He has done real
well with this show and plans to
open another tonight which will be
called the Thing. From the build-up
which he gave this show it sounds
like a must. “The Thing is best de-
scribed as a_ hairy protoplasmic
creature with arms,” he explained.

Lou Pease, like Mr. Lewis has
been with the carnival all his life,
but unlike him, he is there because
he enjoys it. Last year Lou quit the
carnival life and bought a house
on Long Island. As soon as spring
came though, he sold the house
and went back to his gypsy’s life
with the carnival. One of the reasons
that he likes it so much is that
he has the ability to fool people, and
as he put it, “People like to be
fooled.”

In two days the carnival will be
leaving Lexington. If you haven't
seen it yet, the only thing that you
have missed are Tanya, Vicki, Faye,
and Lou’s hairy piece of protoplasm.
Of course you might be one of those
people who enjoy being fooled in
which case you could have a field
day at White’s farm.

 

‘Big Lie’
Goldwater had captured 45 per cent
of their hearts; March of 1964 found
Mr. Nixon in command of 34 per
cent of the Republican voters; and
in April, 1964 Mr. Lodge was firmly
entrenched as the favorite of 42
per cent. Conclusion? I give up!

That the press has treated
Goldwater unmercifully cannot
be denied. Goldwater wins by 9
to 1 in Texas, and Lodge’s write-
in is significant; Lodge wins 7 to
1 over Goldwater in Mass., his
home state, and it’s a smashing
victory; Stassen gets 27 per cent
of the Republican vote in Indiana,
and Goldwater is repudiated—
Wallace gets 31 per cent of the
Democratic vote, same state, same
day, and it’s a dramatic affirma-
tion of President Johnson.

In 1960 Kennedy was “triumphant”
ly” victorious with “landside” victor-
ies in Oregon (51.1 per cent of the
vote), West Virginia (60.8 per cent),
Wisconsin (58 per cent). However,
Senator Goldwater’s victories in
1964 are “discouraging” and “disap-
pointing” (accurate maybe for New
Hampshire) when he wins by 50
per cent (Nebraska), 67 per cent
(Indiana), 64.5 per cent (illinois),
and 78.6 per cent (Texas). One
wonders.

Of course Barry Goldwater will
not be acceptable to Jacob Javitts,
but neither was John Kennedy ac-
ceptable to Harry Byrd. But the
Democrats nominated John Kenne-
dy, and he won.

To speak of a Goldwater mas-
sacre in November is premature

EpitoR

To Whom it may concern:

We, as freshmen, hearing before
our arrival at this university of
the fabulous entertainment that our
school is famous for, would like to
congratulate this year’s Dance Board
for a highly successful year. We,
honestly could not have asked for
better entertainment for our $30.00
investment.

The year got off on the right
foot with a sensational performance
by Lloyd “Mr. Dynamic” Price at
Openings Dance, as he _horse-
laughed his way through Misty ap-
proximately five times too many.
However, this amazing performance
was followed by the internationally
famous recording group, The Up-
setters, at the next night’s con-
cert. Who will ever be able to for-
get the standing ovation given after
a thought provoking rendition of
Monkey Man? ’Tis a shame that as
good a performer as Roy Hamilton
had to appear on the same stage
as the previously mentioned “enter-
tainers”!

 

 

The greatest college weekend in
the South (Fancy Dress; what else?)
was a fantistic Dance Board suc-
cess at both the dance and the
concert. The music of Stan Rubin
and his band was as potent as the
drinks being served. However, every
performance ever given at W&L
must take a back seat to the bril-
liant concert at this year’s F.D. As
has happened at many of her pre-
vious engagements, Dakota Staton
“thank you’ed” the audience to
their feet and right out the door to
the fraternity parties.

Springs was another outstanding
Success. Despite playing on an un-
tuned piano, and before an unre-
ceptive audience, Dave Brubeck
and his group gave a rather lack-
luster performance. The next night’s
concert was a highlight of the year
also. The Dance Board managed to
keep the audience on the edges of
their seats with a well coordinated
and well executed concert. The
Chiffons were great, if you could
hear them. The Crystals were great
in both of the numbers they did.
The Five Royals were great for
fifty-year-old men trying to act
like the infamous Beatles, The one
good performance of the evening
was beyond the planning of the
Dance Board, that is, the accidental
appearance of the Delicardos.

Once again the Board has done
it. The students learned Wednesday
evening of the forthcoming appear-
ance of the Serendipity Singers, a
poor imitation of the New Christy
Minstrels, who are poor imitations of
folk singers.

We wonder who will be contracted
next? Rudy Vallee, The Trashman,
or The Tide Family?

Fourth-Ranked U-Va
Defeats Generals 12-3

By BRUCE GARRETT
Virginia’s Cavaliers maintained their number four national
ranking easily yesterday by downing the Washington and Lee
lacrosse team 12-3 at Charlottesville.
The Generals, playing their last game of the season, never
really had a chance as Virginia took control of the game in
the first quarter and never lost the initiative.

The balance of the Cavalier attack*

is indicated by the game’s leading
scorer (Virginia’s second midfielder
Boyce) had only two goals.

MIS V BS. ssisssssisiscsssssisaasdassisssiesovind 2613—12
W&L

The Generals were shut out until
the third quarter when Bob Os-
troff finally scored on a fine four-
on-three fast break with Duncan
Lamounte getting the assist.

The other General goals came in
the fourth quarter by Randay Woot-
ton, assisted by Mike Michaeles, and
by Bob Frost.

W&L goalie Pete Noonan made 13
saves, while the Cavaliers’ probable
All-American goalie Shreeve only
played in the first half, making 5
saves. Virginia’s sophomore goalie
Brandt who played in the second
half showed great potential and
ended up with 12 saves.

Virginia’s attackmen McGill and
Davies were, as expected, excellent
feeders; and the crease attackman
Peterson also did an outstanding job.

Johnny McDaniel turned in an
excellent performance for the Gen-
erals, gathering in twelve ground
balls.

Washington and Lee thus finishes
its season with a 5-4 record, precise-
ly what was predicted at the be-
ginning of the season.

Season standouts in scoring were
midfielder attackman John McDan-
iel with nineteen goals followed by
attackman Mike Michaeles_ with
thirteen goals. Carroll Klingelhofer
led the Generals in assists for the
season with eighteen.

Phi Kap To Take I-M Trophy;
Participation Cited As Key

By JIM BUSSART

The W&L sports program is just
about over for another year. For
some teams, it has been a success,
for others, perhaps a disappointment.
The Phi Kap story is one of suc-
cess.

Thursday the three major sports
trophies will be awarded at Coach
Mac’s annual sports banquet. Two,
and very likely three of these tro-
phies will be given to John Beagle
intramural manager of Phi Kappa
Sigma.

The Phi Kaps have sewn up the
intramural trophy this year, with a
point total of 1301, the highest ever
achieved since the inception of the
revised point system in the early
50's.

Delt Leads

In the intercollegiate trophy race,
the results will be very close. Per-
rennial champ Delta Tau Delta held
a slim 18 point lead over the Phi
Kap’s going into the spring sport
schedule of tennis, golf, baseball,
track and lacrosse, but Phi Kap
should get close to full participation
in each of these. The final results
will not be known until next week.

The grand athletic trophy has al-

most surely been won by Phi Kappa
Sigma, although this is unofficial
because the final results have not
yet been announced. With their
strong lead in intramurals and at
least second place in_ intercolle-
giate competition, the Phi Kap’s are
almost incontestably the grand ath-
letic winners of 1963-64.

The Phi Kap’s won four first place
trophies in intramural competition—
swimming, cross-country, ping pong
and track. They also took two sec-
onds and a fourth.

INTRAMURAL YEAR
A FEATHER IN THE PLD LAP

By TOM WHITE

Phi Kappa Sig, with champion-
ships in four sports, has apparently
upset the defending champ Delt
in the race for the school’s athletic
championship. The Phi Kap’s took
firsts in swimming, the turkey trot,
track, and table tennis while adding
second place finishes in bowling and
tennis.

While losing their championship,
the Delts did take two firsts, in hand-
ball and softball. Beta, standing only
in sixth place over-all, also won

two championships, copping the
honors in football and tennis.
Fall Sports

In marching to their winning ef-
fort, Phi Kap got off to a good start
when they took two firsts and a sec-
ond in the fall sports. They opened
the season with a second place ef-
fort in tennis, behind winning Beta.
Phi Delt finished third for the sec-
ond straight year, and Delt was
fourth.

Then the attention shifted to golf
where Phi Delt moved up from third
place last year to take the title this
year. Following the Phi Delt’s were
Kappa Sig, Pi Phi, and Sigma Nu.

Touch football was next, and here
Beta took their first championship,
edging out the Law school. Follow-
ing behind the top two were SPE
and Phi Gam.

The Phi Kaps moved out in front
of the pack as the next two sports
were completed. They took firsts in
the turkey trot and swimming.

Led by John Laimbeer, the Phi
Kap team swept by Lambda Chi,
Phi Psi, and SAE in the turkey trot.
In swimming, the Phi Kap team
piled up the most participation,
meet, and board points of any team
entered to walk away with the title.

Winter Sports

The Phi Kap lead was threatened
with the completion of the winter
sports which gave Delt and SAE,
currently fifth place overall, big
boosts.

The winter season opened with
wrestling of which KA became I-M
champ. Finishing behind it were
Sigma Chi, DU (fourth last year),
and Beta.

Turning to bowling, Kappa Sig,
behind Tom Pace, took its first
championship, edging the defending
champion Phi Kap’s in a close match.
SAE took third and Phi Delt fourth.

For the second straight year, SAE
wound up winning basketball, but
not before battling Beta in a hard
fought final game. Sigma Nu, sec-

fer, fourth.

It was the Delts turn next. In a
tight three-team battle for first
place, the Delts won handball when
they downed a KA team that had
earlier defeated them. Beta was third
and PiKA again fourth.

Spring Sports

Both Phi Kap and Delt did well
in the spring sports.

Phi Kap opened with two quick
victories, padding their lead over the
Delts. Winning table tennis, the Phi
Kap’s faced tough competition from
ZBT, defending champ DU, and
Sigma Nu. In winning the annual
track meet, Phi Kap was followed
by Delt, SAE and Lambda Chi.

ZBT moved into third place over-
all when they won the I-M volley-
ball title. DU, second last year, came

in second again this year while
Delt was third and Phi Kap was
fourth.

In action completed last week,
Delt gained 25 points on Phi Kap
by taking the softball title on the
strong pitching arm of Fred Schaef-
fer. ZBT virtually clinched third
place over-all with their second
place finish. Beta and PiKA tied for
third.

Perhaps the most unusual occur-
rence of the year was the big dif-
ference in Beta’s athletic and intra-
mural totals. The Beta’s finished in
16th place in intercollegiate ath-
letics, while taking second in I-M
totals. Phi Kap led in I-M totals
with Beta second and Delt third.
In intercollegiate, Delt leads, Phi
Kap is in second, and ZBT is third.

TO THE TUESDAY sports page
which has, self-admittedly, the best
sports news on campus: Glad you
pointed out our errors of Friday
last. We checked with cartoonist
Apgar, discovered Southwestern
was indeed in the bell (Freudian
symbolism and all that).

As for the typographical error,
you might consider La Chausee’s
statement, “When everyone is in
the wrong, everyone is in the
right.”

Criticism is, after all, what we
say about other people who don’t
have the same faults we do.

IN JANUARY we began a week-
ly intramural column justified, we
felt, by the percentage of the stu-
dent body taking part in the pro-
gram.

This week we devote nearly an
entire page to intramurals, while
announcing intramural participa-
tion has jumped nearly 10 per cent
above last year.

Intramural reporter Tom White
includes his interpretation of the
year, with another cartoon by Gar-
ry Apgar (Tuesday will wonder
why KA is missing). We also got
Phi Kap Jim Bussart to write of
his fraternity’s triumph.

SEVEN hundred eighty-eight of
1,163 students took part in the 1963-
64 program, 68 per cent of the stu-
dent body as opposed to 58.4 per
cent last year.

More students participated this
year than any year previous, al-
though 1957-58, with 69.6, had a
higher percentage. For the first
time since 1960 participation pass-
ed the 60 per cent level.

The three major sports—football,
softball and basketball—had the
highest totals of individual partici-
pants, football with 374, softball with
271, and basketball with 224.

cinema medium become in Fellini’s
hands that the viewer begins to
identify immediately with the pre-
dicament of Anselmi; making crea-
tive frustration stick with a generally
non-creative audience is no mean
trick.

The title is not the only proof
that Anselmi is a close portrait
of Fellini himself, (Fellini has sev-
en major films and three short
subjects—hence “eight and one-
half”) there are little personal
touches in every frame that stamp
this film with the leving concern
of a great artist who wants very
much to express what it is like to
be himself, not from any sense of
ego, but so that others may recog-
nize in his own weaknesses and
triumphs something of themselves.
This is a high and noble (as well
as difficult) task, and Fellini has
succeeded brilliantly. There is a
quiet grandeur about 812 that sim-
ply transcends comment.

zo the film editor. Marcello Mastro-
ianni is superb as the hamstrung
director; Sandra Milo makes a se-
ductive mistress, Anouk Aimee, an
understanding wife. The large com-
pany is cast perfectly down to the
most inconsequential parts; surely
no one will forget the appearance of
Edra Gale as the fat whore Saraghi-
na, who has no alternative in life
but to dance grotesquely on a beach
for the amusement of children.

Throughout the year we have
predicted consistently that the in-
ternational cinema was not the
dreary farce suggested by Holly-
wood products, and that one would
do well to cultivate an apprecia-
tion of the more important for-
eign directors. Thanks to the vital
interest of Mr. Side, we have had
ample opportunity to study the
work of Bergman, Visconti, An-
tonioni, Bourguignon, Forbes, and
Richardson (before Tom Jones).
Now in this magnificent film of
Fredrico Fellini, the semester can
truly end on a golden note. 8!2
is not the last word, of course, but
it is a splendid example of a man
of genius using his talents to con-
sumate advantage.

an amateurish. To visualize a
hopelessly divided Republican
Party is to give credence to a
myth—a myth perpetrated by lib-
eral columnists and East Coast
Republicans who refuse to allow
the Control of the Republican
Party to slip from their grasp. The
preservation of liberalism in the
GOP is the self-appointed task of
numerous pubdits before they ral-
ly ‘round the Democratic flag each
election year.

If by such tactics (and who else
but Barry could cop the TW-3
“nomination”) they can “seare” the

Party out of nominating a conserva-
tive—if there were no Goldwater,
they would lambast Nixon—the vic-
tory is their’s without a shot being
fired.

Maybe it would be a mistake for
the GOP to nominate Goldwater be-
cause of the damage an alleged hu-
miliating defeat would do to the
Party. I honestly don’t know. But
the criticism should not be directed
at the Senator and his supporters
for their quest of the prize, but

Maybe Walter Lippman, Joseph,

Dr. Cole also will make the gradu-
ation remarks, a tradition followed
by Washington and Lee’s presidents
for more than 30 years.

Also scheduled to speak during
the ceremony which approximately
1,700 faculty members, parents and
friends are expected to attend, will

mony in Lee Chapel.

Fifty-three students will be com-
missioned Second Lieutenants, with
three accepting Regular Army com-
missions, and three will be commis-
sioned Second Lieutenants in the
Marine Corps.

Sprunt To Give Baccalaureate

Dr. David W. Sprunt will deliver
the baccalaureate sermon to the
class of 1964 in a service at 11 am.
Thursday in Evans Dining Hall. The
service is being held in this building
for the second year because no other
auditorium on campus _ provides
enough seats for all who wish to
attend.

Academic processions will precede
both the baccalaureate service and
the commencement exercises.

Following the Baccalaureate
Thursday, seniors and their families
will be guests of the Alumni Asso-
ciation at a luncheon on the front
lawn.

Reception at Cole’s

At 9 p.m. Thursday, President and
Mrs. Cole will have the seniors and

then Washington College from 1865
to 1870.

Final Senior Dance

The Finals Dance will follow at
10 p.m. in Evans Dining Hall.

The Thursday night dance will
close out the year’s social activities.
It will be formal, and parents of
seniors are invited to attend.

as head of Washington and Lee’s
biology program. Dr. Stevens is
retiring in June after 18 years on
the University faculty.

Also named by Dean Pusey were
two new assistant professors and
eight new instructors, including one
who will hold the title of “artist in
residence.”

Appointments as assistant profes-
sors include Sterling M. Boyd, 30,
in fine arts, and George W. Ray,
32, in English.

Appointed instructor in fine arts
was Ray Prohaska, 63, noted New
York painter and illustrator who

Barritt, Sensabaugh Given Leave
To Study In Cooperative Program

Two Washington and Lee profes-
sors have been named fellows in a
Cooperative Program in the Hu-
manities sponsored jointly by Duke
University and the University of
North Carolina.

Dr. C. Westbrook Barritt, profes-
sor of romance languages, and Dr.
Leon F. Sensabaugh, professor of
history, will participate in the pro-
gram during the 1964-65 academic
year.

The program, made possible by a
five year grant from the Humani-
ties and Arts Program of the Ford
Foundation to Duke University and
the University of North Carolina,
will allow Dr. Barritt and Dr.
Sensabaugh to do research in their
fields of interest at either institu-
tion.

The program, to operate for the
first time this fall, is planned to give
distinguished faculty members in

 

the humanities a year to study and
and do research in their particular
fields of interest.

Two advanced graduate students
from Duke or North Carolina will
appointed to the Washington and
Lee faculty for the academic year.
Dr. Barritt and Dr. Sensabaugh are
participating in the special program.

Dr. Barritt has taught at Wash-
ington and Lee since 1952. Previous-
ly he was instructor in Spanish dur-
ing the 1947-48 academic year and
also has taught at Muhlenberg Col-
lege and Emory University.

Dr. Sensabaugh came to Wash-
ington and Lee in 1956 as Dean of
the University after teaching at
Birmingham-Southern College for
20 years where he was head of the
Department of History and Political
Science and chairman of the Divi-
sion of Social Science from 1943 to
1956.

By MIKE HASH

Lee have exceeded those of any
year on record, according to Dean
of Admissions James D. Farrar. The
total number of final applications
submitted to the Admissions Office
was 1480 which compares with 1270
of the previous year. Of these ap-
plicants 623 were offered admission.
and 340 have confirmed their places
in the Class of 1968.

Statistics are not yet available
on the distribution of the class or
their average on the Scholastic Ap-
titude Test. Dean Farrar could give
no indication of the ratio between
students from public and private
institutions, but he did feel that the

most impressive. The class of '68
includes forty sons of alumni which
is a considerable increase from last
year.

High Quality of Applicants

In commenting further on the
class Dean Farrar attributed the
high quality of applicants to an

increased pregram of guidance on
the secondary school level. “We
had very few applicants who did
not present adequate credentials.”
Dean Farrar also stated that the
real test of any class will be the
results of the first semester.

The selection of the freshman
class is the responsibility of the
Committee on Admissions. The mem-
oun of this year’s committee are:

Financial Aid

Dean Lewis G. John also an-
nounced the program of financial
aid which will be offered to ap-
proximately 20 per cent of the in-
coming freshmen. There are 10 full
scholarships: 6 Lee and 4 Baker.
The University’s grant-loan program
has been made available to a
total of of 41 freshmen. In addi-
tion one freshman will be employed
at the Commons and another will
receive a Rockbridge County Grant.

Each year a certain number of
Washington Awards are given to
those freshmen, who in the opin-
ion of the Scholarship Committee,
possess outstanding qualifications,
but fail to demonstrate real need.
These awards are primarily in rec-
ognition of superior academic
achievement, although $100 is ap-
plied to tuition. There are 9 Wash-
ington Award winners in the in-
coming class.

Dean John said that of those stu-
dents who applied for financial aid,
the committee was able to offer as-
sistance to all who were well quali-
fied and demonstrated a real need.
The total amount of financial aid
given to members of the new fresh-
man class is $63,940. This represents
an inerease of about $20,000 from last
year.

IFC Takes Rush
Out Of Rushing
With New Rules

By SYD LEWIS

Washington and Lee’s traditional
rush system will undergo a major
revamping next fall. Instead of the
rush into the dorms and mad dash
in order to persuade freshmen to
visit a certain fraternity house,
freshmen will be asked to designate
fraternities they wish to see dur-
ing the first two days of rush
called “open houses.”

No rushee will be allowed to see
a house more than once during
“open houses” and must see a min-
imum of ten fraternities. “Open
houses” will last forty minutes and
no intoxicating beverages may be
served during this time.

Dorm Rushing Limited

After the first two days, a sub-
dued form of the old rushing for-
mat will be followed. The fraternities
will rush the dorms; however, only
four members of each fraternity will
be allowed to enter the dorms.
Freshmen will sign up to see fra-
ternities at formal rush dates where
beer may be served.

Because of the parking problem
near the freshmen dorms, only Phi
Kappa Psi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon,
Zeta Beta Tau, Pi Kappa Phi, Lamb-
da Chi, Phi Epsilon Pi, Delta Upsi-
lon, and Kappa Sigma will be allow-
ed to use cars to transport rushees.

Summer Rush Important

The new rushing system, accord-
ing to several fraternity rushing
chairmen, will shift considerable
emphasis of the rushing programs to
the summer months. A considerable
amount of work will be spent on
contacting prospective rushees to
insure that they sign up for a certain
house during the “open rush” dates.

The general rush rules concern-
ing fraternity etiquette, contact
with freshmen, and fining remain
the same. In accordance with the
rising cost of living, the freshmen
rushing fee has been raised from
three to five dollars and a seven
dollar fifty cent fee for late pay-
ments.

The changes were made in the new
IFC constitution which was submit-
ted this year.

«party, has already announced that
the party will begin as soon as the
last exam is over Tuesday afternoon.
The Delacardos will be on hand
to provide music and the drink for
afternoon will be gin and juice.
The cocktail party will run until
about seven. Candler has knowingly
predicted “quite a lively party.”
Tuesday Night Concert

The Serendipity Singers will per-
form from 8 to 10 p.m. that evening
for the concert in Doremus gym-
nasium. Originating at the University
of Colorado, this group of seven
men and two women came to na-
tional fame several months ago with
their big hit “Don’t Let the Rain
Come Down.”

Featuring a sound much like that
of the New Christy Minstrels, the
Serendipity Singers were discovered
by Fred Weintraub, a New York
City night club owner. Since they
became nationally known, they have
played at clubs in New York, Chi-
cago, and on a number of “Hoote-
nanny” television shows.

Wednesday has nothing officially
planned for the dance set, although
there will be a number of parties
thrown by fraternity groups.

Reception at Cole’s

Thursday night there will be a
reception at president Cole’s home
for graduating seniors, their dates,
and parents. This reception will be
from nine to ten. At ten the Senior
Dance will begin in the Evans Din-
ing Hall. Music is to be provided
by the Joe Lynn Quintet, a local
group which played at the same
occasion last year.

Ken Lane, a graduating Phi Delt
senior, is Finals Dance President.
The following are his vice presi-
dents: Ed Croft, a KA from Atlanta,
is in charge of the figure; Brice
Gamber, a Delt from Baltimore, is
handling publicity; Peter Candler, a
KA from Atlanta, is in charge of
the cocktail party; Jere Cravens, a
SPE from Tulsa, has charge of the
invitations; and Conway Shields,
a PiKA from Newport News, is
handling the decorations for the
concert. Bill Noell, an SAE from
Bluefield, West Virginia, and Roger
Paine, a Phi Gam from Arlington,
are honorary vice presidents.

Combo Parties Scheduled

The Rhythm Makers will be at KA
from 9 to 2 Wednesday morning and
afternoon, and the Ambassadors
will be at the Girl Scout Camp from
2 to 6 Wednesday afternoon. Night
parties are planned.

The Glory and the Dream

Conservatism goes for comfort; reform for truth.
—Ralph Waldo Emerson

Generally young men are regarded as radicals.
This is a popular misconception. The most conser-
vative persons I have ever met are college under-

graduates.
—Woodrow Wilson

Four years ago an editor of this newspaper wrote an
editorial entitled “Brink of Greatness.” In it he expressed
his belief that Washington and Lee was poised on the
threshold of a new and progressive era—an era that would
catapult W&L to the top of the academic world. But in
the past four years, W&L has, if anything, backed farther
away from greatness than ever, and it continues to dis-
grace the liberal, courageous, and humanitarian spirit
which characterizes both its namesakes. Here are a few
of the reasons:

Washington and Lee is bound to bigotry. Narrow-
minded, segregationist views which belong in the 1870's
are holding W&L at a standstill while the rest of the South
and the nation moves ahead faster every year. We should
declare ourselves an open school, both racially and relig-
iously; we should cast aside the bigots who contribute
their money but who attach all-white strings to it. There
is an ample amount of money to be had from organiza-
tions and individuals who have recognized the fact that
even Negroes are human.

Washington and Lee persists in Victorian standards of
morality. Drinking is prohibited at football games and at
school dances and concerts. A student must decide for
himself whether or not he wants to drink alcoholic bever-
ages, but the Board of Trustees must not be allowed to
decide whether he can drink at a football game or a jazz
concert. This prohibition is just as backward and anti-
quated as the tacit prohibition against Negro students.

Washington and Lee is allowing its fraternity system
to weaken and die. Despite the passage of a new IFC con-
stitution this year, fraternities are falling apart. They can-
not possibly survive as anything more than eating clubs
when their members are spread all over Lexington in
apartments. Students move to apartments for one primary
reason: so they will have a quiet, private place to take
their dates. There is no reason why fraternity houses
shouldn’t serve that purpose as well as apartments. Wo-
men should be allowed on the upper floors of all fra-
ternity houses, and into the upperclass dorms.

The first objection to opening fraternities and dorms
in this manner is that it would encourage sexual promis-
cuity. We submit that if a student and his date want to
have sexual intercourse, they will find a place to go one
way or another. The main point is that fraternity men
would enjoy living in their houses much more if their
rooms were open to girls; this would increase house
solidarity and brotherhood immensely. The administra-
tion must want fraternities to die out, but when they go,
it will be one more shovelful of dirt on W&L’s rapidly-
filling grave.

Washington and Lee has an oligarchic form of student
government which tends toward corruption. It is corrupt
because its leader’s pet phrase this year has been “‘let’s put
the ‘quietus’ on this.” It is corrupt because it manipu-
lates into positions of authority only those students whose
minds are sufficiently straitjacketed to passively accept
all of W&L’s sacred cows. It is corrupt because it squelches
debate, and thereby encourages stagnation.

Washington and Lee allows puerility to exist in some
of its student leaders. Here is a case in point: a member
of the Publications Board stopped one of this year’s can-
didates for election to the editorship of the Ring-tum Phi
before the elections were held. He told the candidate
he hated him so much he did not plan to vote in the elec-
tion, because he could not possibly be objective in his vot-
ing. That student voted in the election anyway, as it was
his privilege to do—but it is safe to assume his vote was
cast in hatred, without any consideration for the merits of
the candidate. That same student and others like him will
not consider the merits of this editorial, and for the same

reason.

Washington and Lee tries to make very simple things
out of situations which are highly complex. An example
is the honor system. The founding fathers of this system
must have had in mind an ideal community—one in
which no dishonest men would remain. But into this ideal
community that is W&L come fallible young men who are
in the process of learning. They have a lot to learn about
life as well as the arts when they first step on campus.
Every student bravely believes his honor is strong—that
it will stand up under pressure. Some students find that
personal or academic problems drive them to do some-
thing they wouldn’t ordinarily do, and they wind up per-
manently expelled from W&L on an honor violation.

The American system of law recognizes the complex-
ities involved in various types of crimes, and adjusts its

Edward C. Atwood, Jr.:
A New Era For W&L

The Ring-tum Phi this year sa-
lutes Dean of Students Edward C.
Atwood, Jr., for his outstanding
contribution to Washington and Lee
as an administrator, a professor, and
a willing friend to all members of

| the student body.

Dean Atwood’s accomplishments
fall into two major categories—the
tangible and the intangible. On the

| surface is the work he did to help
_ secure for Washington and Lee a
' more liberal cut system. There is

his constant and understanding work
with the Interfraternity Council to
help draft a new constitution. Dean

_ Atwood never attempted to force

his opinion on any student; rather,
he was willing to offer it if asked.
His words were thus made all the

_ more valuable.

On a deeper and less evident
level of accomplishment are the
hundreds of private conferences
which Dean Atwood has held with
members of the student body. His
guidance, his encouragement, and
his reprimands have favorably af-
fected the lives of scores of
W&L students. Though his job as
Dean of Students involves some
responsibilities which cannot often
be pleasantly carried out, Dean
Atwood brings to this job a sense

 

  

After graduation this year, the
Board of Trustees will meet to dis-
cuss the future of Washington and
Lee. These are the people who are
ultimately entrusted with the preser-
vation and the policy of our school.
And, fortunately, they have shown
themselves to be capable and
thoughtful people, for they have
made Washington and Lee the aca-
demic success it is.

But this year the board will feel
more intensely the pressure that
has been mounting in recent years—
the pressure caused by the tre-
mendous social problem our whole
country faces, that of integration.

Pressure More Intense

The pressure will be more in-
tense this year for several reasons.
There can be little doubt that
Negroes and concerned whites all
over the nation will be agitating
more than ever this year to try to
assure for Negroes their rightful
place in our society. Brother schools
in the South have already inte-
grated or are planning to do so.
Even some of the neighboring pri-
vate girls’ schools have announced
expected changes in their admissions
policies. And in our own school,
there are sizeable numbers of fac-
ulty and students who are interested
and anxious to see an inter-racial
student body here.

So the board must consider once
more this year what it is going to
do about integration. As it now is,
the policy is to wait and hope. As
far as can be gleaned from sources

A Look at Washington and Lee

 

 

1964’s Summer of Decision
For The Board of Trustees

By Lamar Lamb

here, Washington and Lee will re-
ceive any application from qualified
male applicants. If a Negro applies
and is found qualified, Dr. Cole will
refer his application to the Board
of Trustees. Then Washington and
Lee’s policy toward Negroes will be
decided.

Present Policy Wrong

To my way of thinking, there are
several things wrong with this poli-
cy. The most obvious is that the
whole future of our school is left
to chance or to the NAACP (ironi-
cally), whichever happens to act
first. As it now is, we are waiting
for a Negro to apply, and (assumed-
ly) hoping none does. So right now,
thereis one Negro boy somewhere
in this country, one who is intelli-
gent, “clean,” and a rising senior in
high school, and this Negro boy
holds the fate of Washington and
Lee—at least in one sense—in his
hands.

There are other obvious things
wrong with our policy. Washington
and Lee is very proud of the fact
that a large percentage of its gradu-
ates grow to be civic, state and na-
tional leaders. We can assume that
many people who are now studying
at Washington and Lee will some-

day have a great deal of influence
over the affairs of this country.

Failing of W&L

But in effect, Washington and Lee
is training leaders who will have
no knowledge—or at best accidental
knowledge—of the most pressing
domestic issue of the century. No
matter what one’s feelings and be-
liefs on the subject, race relations
will be a problem that will confront
all of us the rest of our lives.
And yet, at the place where we
should learn to think about these
problems, we find a void, a desperate
and hopeful void which says, “ig-
nore the problem, maybe it will go
away.”

(Continued on page 5)

 

of tact and understanding which
is truly rare.

One of Dean Atwood’s greatest
attributes is the image of W&L
which he portrays both to alumni
and to prospective freshmen. His
ivy-league dress, his impeccable
manners, and his tendency to allow
the other person to dominate the
conversation while he himself care-
fully controls it all reflect the calm
strength and decision of Washing-
ton and Lee.

Dean Atwood’s long apprentice-
ship offers the reason for his pres-
ent competence. He first joined the
faculty here in 1952 as an assistant
professor of economics. He was pro-
moted to associate professor in 1959,
but a year later he left W&L to join
the General Electric Company’s staff
of economists in New York.

In February, 1962, Dean Atwood
was named Dean of Students suc-
ceeding Frank J. Gilliam. He re-
sumed his duties as professor of
economics here. Since then he has
held the position of Dean of Stu-
dents, and with President Fred C,
Cole promises to do an outstanding
job of leading W&L into its new-
est era.

Dean Atwood earned his B.A.,
M.A, and Ph.D. degrees from
Princeton University. He came to

a W&L originally from Denison Uni-
| versity where he was an instructor

in economics. During World War II

. he served in the U.S. Navy. On
| March 30, 1946, he married June
‘|Ruschmeyer; they have two chil-

dren, Terry and Jeff.

It is impossible to measure the
good which Edward C. Atwood,
Jr., has done for Washington and
Lee in two short years as Dean of
Students. What he will do in his
remaining career at W&L is limited

‘| only by the bounds of a free imagi-

nation. His open-mindedness, his
willingness to listen to the other
side of any question, his public and
private demeanor, and most of all his
unquestionable moral integrity earn
for him this very insufficient en-
comium from those of us who have
both favored and opposed him all
year long in our editorial columns.
We all join in unqualified salute to
an exceptional man.

ton and Lee Mock Convention nom-

= ' Pi s inated Senator Barry Goldwater as
. ’ = the 1964 GOP nominee for the pres-

i fe : : Scranton as the vice-presidential
REPUBLIC ‘AN , : = nominee.

: J io” F : These choices were immediately
broadcast Giveashinc! the nation by
means of newspaper, radio, and tel-

evision coverage unprecedented in
Mock Convention history. On the
national scene, W&L received full

coverage in Time magazine along
with pictures and a compliment.

AP and UPI Coverage

The Associated Press and United
Press International ran preliminary
stories describing the convention
and then bulletins announcing the
results.

The New York Times and the
Washington Post both ran extensive
stories about the convention until
Goldwater was nominated. On the
state level, news coverage was com-
plete with front page stories.

The Mock Convention is not treat-
ed lightly by the political pros. The
convention has picked the winners
in eight out of twelve convention
years, and has gained such a rap-
port with the politicians that this
year’s convention received gener-
ous financing by the candidates.

f toy

Several state party chairmen and
campaign representatives for the
major candidates were also here for
the balloting.

Political Trends Forecast
Immediately following the con-
vention there was a good deal of
skepticism as to the accuracy of
the decision made. In the past three
weeks, a clearer perspective shows
that at least some of the political

Trustees Need
To Make A
Positive Stand

(Continued from page 2)

But like the grasshopper who play-
ed all summer hoping that winter
wouldn’t come, W&L will have to
meet the problem sooner or later.
Each student at Washington and
Lee will face the problem more
than once in the years after he
leaves here. If we have not planned
for the eventuality, it will be hard
on us all,

Refusal to Face the Facts

What we should be working on
is how to conquer the problems
that will arise when a Negro does
come—fraternities, freshman camp,
the dorms, ete. But our hands are
tied because we refuse to recognize
the problem. |

Last week, Rod Cockshutt rightly |
declared in his column, “a univer-
sity’s success or failure depends on
the extent to which it challenges
the minds of its students to con-
front new, often unpalatable ideas.”
But at Washington and Lee, both
the school and the student body do
not confront a very old idea— a
man, because he is a man, should be
treated as an equal.

Washington and Lee cannot let
such pettiness and fear ruin the
good it does in the academic realm.
It would be sad to see such a small
thing cause the foundations of a
great institution to crack or crumble.
But that has happened before, and
will again. Hopefully, the Board of
Trustees will decide that it won’t
happen here.

‘The Glory And The Dream’

(Continued from page 2)

penalties to meet the seriousness of the crime. Here at
W&L, faced with the same complexities as to types of
honor violations, we have only one penalty for the con-
victed student. We suggest that at the very least a student
from the senior law or undergraduate class be elected each
year to act as a defense counsel for every accused violator.
Ideally, the permanent expulsion penalty should be re-
duced to a one-year expulsion.

Washington and Lee should not persist in the hypocri-
sy of calling itself a Christian institution. The catalogue
states that an “enduring adherence of the University is
its dedication to the Christian ideal.” To the contrary:
We&L is not merciful to its honor violators; W&L does
not forgive these students; W&L only judges and con-
demns. W&L does not love, for it will not declare its
doors open to all capable men, and a love which is quali-
fied is not love at all.

Finally, Washington and Lee will persist in this ostrich-
eye view of life. We don’t have all the answers to W&L’s
problems. Some students here think they do. The trouble
is that these same students have not even begun to ask
the questions. The administration and the faculty are slow-
ly and desperately trying to back W&L into the twentieth
century. But the student body, basking in apathy, is wear-
ing what Dietrich Bonhoeffer called “the blinkers of
perfectionism” which prevent one from seeing his own
faults. For this reason and those mentioned above, W&L
will remain just where it is right now—on the brink of
greatness, forever.

It is not now as it hath been of yore;—
Turn wheresoe’er I may,
By night or day,
The things which I have seen I now can see no more.

Whither is fled the visionary gleam?
Where is it now, the glory and the dream?

—William Wordsworth

’°64 Convention
In Retrospect

(Continued from page 4)
trends were correctly forecast by
our state chairmen.

Most eye-catching of all is the
present trend in California, which
shows Governor Nelson Rockefeller

 

Notice

 

| Goldwater

 

of New York leading Goldwater.
At the time of the convention, when
our California delegation decided to
go for Rockefeller, there ws con-
siderable criticism as to the wiseness
of the decision. The pros are cer-
tainly no longer predicting a Gold-
water landslide in California, as they
were when we held the convention.

Time Vindicates Our Judgement

Even without California, however,
won our convention.

 

Time confirmed W&L views in the
May 22 edition. It showed that even
with a win in Oregon and a po-
tential victory in California, Rocke-
feller still lagged far behind in the
pack of the candidates.

Especially significant is the fact
that, unknown to W&L, Time was
writing a pre-convention story
which indicated strongly that Gold-
water and Scranton would, in their
estimation, receive the nominations.
One day after our convention, this

 

 

issue reached the campus and vin-
dicated our judgment.

In the same edition, Time quoted
several probable votes of various
committed and uncommitted states;
these votes tallied in many cases

with the exact vote totals given
at W&L.

Such indications have encouraged
the Steering Committee as to the
efficacy of the nominations made
here.
