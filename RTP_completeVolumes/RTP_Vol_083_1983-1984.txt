Two convicted
on drug charges

By RICK SWAGLER
Chief Editor

A Washington and Lee
University senior and a former
‘,&L student have been ordered
jailed until presentence reports
are completed after they were
convicted Friday of selling
drugs to fellow students.

Thomas J. Rohrig of
Michigan, a W&L senior, was
convicted in Lexington Circuit
Court of selling marijuana and
possession of marijuana with
intent to distribute. He faces a
maximum prison sentence of 20
years.

‘(The maximum sentence) is
not a reality...it’s not prac-
tical,’’ Rohrig said. Rohrig is
currently on a work-release
program, which allows him to
attend classes during the days
and requires him to return to
jail at night and on weekends.

“T really want to finish my
last year here,” Rohrig said.
“People make mistakes every
day of their lives — maybe not
as serious as mine — but we all
deserve a chance to come
back.”

 

Tom Rohrig

Rohrig said that the small
3ize of the campus has added to
‘the embarrasment because,
‘everyone’s pointing their
‘inger.”’

William L. Dederick of New
York, whose W&L diploma was
vithheld after his arrest in
May, was convicted of selling

cocaine, possession of cocaine
with intent to distribute and
possession of marijuana seeds
and plants with intent to grow
the drug. He faces up to 40 years
in prison and a $25,000 fine, ac-
cording to Commonwealth’s At-
torney Beverly C. ‘‘John”
Read. Dederick is to report to
jail tomorrow at noon, the Lex-
ington Circuit Court Clerk said.

Read said he asked that the
two be jailed until presentence
reports are completed to ‘‘serve
as a deterrent to those who’ve
been selling marijuana and co-
caine...It’s the only deterrent
we have to pushers. For that
type of person, strong action
has to be taken.”’

The presentence reports were
requested by the defendants’ at-
torney and are designed to give
the judge a more thorough
knowledge of the defendant’s
background, aiding his deci-
sions regarding sentencing. The
reports will take four to six
weeks to complete because the
men are from other states.

Read has said he will ask for

stiff sentences.

On the W&L campus, the fate
of the two is up to the Student
Control Committee, which is
composed of class officers. The
committee’s decision may be

appealed.

Read said student informants
whose names were not revealed
in court were used in what he
called an ‘‘ongoing’’ investiga-
tion into drug distribution at the
university.

A third man, also a former

W&L student, Marc Ham, is

scheduled to be tried for posses-
sion of cocaine and sale of co-

caine on Sept. 26 at 2 p.m. in
Lexington Circuit Court. Ham
was arrested April 16 and three
ounces of cocaine were con-
fiscated from his house.

New grade system begins

Some students are unaware of many of the changes

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

The introduction this fall of
plus/minus grading to replace
straight letter grades for course
work has provoked little re-
sponse from the university com-
munity, with students and
faculty alike taking a ‘‘wait-
and-see”’ attitude.

Opinion is essentially divided
as to whether the new system
will help or hurt students
overall, and several university
officials, while conceding that
the change likely will have
some effect, expect the impact
on students to be minimal.

Many students interviewed
were under the impression that
the plus/minus grades would
apply only to the 1987 entering
class but, as stated in the
university catalog, the new

system will be used for all
enrolled students.

In response to the misconcep-
tion, Lewis G. John, Dean of
Students, said, ‘‘Distribution re-
quirements and general educa-
tion requirements should be
phased in because students
should have to meet the re-
quirements of the catalog that
was current when they entered.

“This, though, is really only a
refinement in the method of
grading, so the feeling was that
it should be applied to all
classes as of a certain date.”’

The shift in grading pro-
cedure was approved by the
faculty at its May 1982 meeting.
The proposal was submitted to
it without a recommendation by
the Faculty Committee on
Courses and Degrees, which is
headed by William J. Watt,
Dean of the College.

Dean Watt said that his com-
mittee submitted the proposal
at the request of the faculty,
which then adopted it by what
he called a ‘‘significant majori-
_

The presentation was made
without an accompanying opi-
nion, he said, because ‘‘there
was no feeling on the committee
as a whole that a recommenda-
tion was needed.”’

The research for the proposal
was done in 1976, when the com-
mittee, again at the direction of
the faculty, investigated a wide
range of alternative grading
systems.

At that time, Dean Watt said,
many of the faculty members
were concerned about grade in-
flation. Any change in the
marking system was rejected,
partly due to disagreement

Review and Outlook

A Forum

According to the W&L handbook, the Ring-tum Phi
is the university newspaper which reports on all stu-
dent matters and provides a ‘‘forum”’ for student opi-
nion. While we strive to execute the first adequately,

we question the remaining accuracy in the forum
description. On the brink of a new year, the 1983-84
staff seeks to re-establish the Phi as an active and
reflective bulletin board for the student body.

Too quickly come to mind the memories of ir-
responsibly written editorials and the consequent
shower of letters berating the editors for the
‘‘shallow-mindedness’”’ or inaccuracy. Such confron-
tation often transformed the editorial page into a bat-
tle field for written blows between the student body
and the paper.

With the shadow of such confrontation still linger-
ing in some of our minds, we have planned measures
to reform the editorial page into an opinion forum.

Next week two features will debut which are aimed
at cultivating opinion. Next Thursday the Phi will in-
clude the top national and international news stories
of the week. In addition, we will interview faculty and
publish their opinions on news and trends both
domestic and foreign.

These features, in addition to guest editorials and
our own opinions, we hope will spur your response.
Whether this response is favorable or critical, our
aim is to increase weekly correspondence and
decrease campus apathy.

You and the ABC laws

Students will have to step carefully

By JOHN CLEGHORN
Chief Editor

Freshmen and the members
of the 17 fraternities at Wash-
ington and Lee face several
threatening changes in the 1983
Rush. With the imposition of the
new drinking law, the arrival of
a new police chief facing his
first Rush season and a new
Alcoholic Beverage Control of-
ficer in Lexington, those par-
ticipating in Rush will have to
step quietly and carefully.

ST
News_ Analysis

For the first time in over 20
years, W&L men will take part
in a dry Rush, as a result of a
law passed last year in the Vir-
ginia legisiature that raised the
minimum drinking age to 19.
The Interfraternity Council, in
conjunction with the university,
has in turn, designed a Rush
schedule that still allows for a
realistic view of the fraternity
system.

The calendar maintains dry
Rush Dates and Open Houses
while simultaneously sustain-
ing times for fraternities to hold
more characteristic beer par-
ties. For rushing freshmen to
see fraternities in both at-
mospheres is essential.

But in sponsoring beer par-

ties, even more responsibility
falls on the leaders of the frater-
nities. During parties, frater-
nities must stay within the
moderate limits of the law or
face criminal charges.

According to the ABC region-
al supervising officer, the
fraternities will be trusted to
extents.

the officers of the fraternity as
well as any persons under 19
found consuming alcohol,
Stoneman explained.

A similar tone of moderation
and authority will be applied
locally by the Lexington police
force. In a meeting with the
fraternity presidents and Rush
chairmen last week Police
Chief L.O. Sutton explained his
policies.

©R easonableness in enforcement

is important, but enforcement

there will be’

 

Stoneman said that the same
enforcement policies for a dry
Rush that the ABC applied to
Virginia Tech this fall would be
used in Lexington.

“We are going to rely on the
fraternities to provide securi-
ty,” Stoneman said. ‘‘We are
not out to get them,” he con-
tinued.

He explained that parties at‘
VPI were not closely :moni-
tored. Only when complaints
were filed with the ABC was ac-
tion taken, he said. If com-
plaints were filed, an under-
cover agent was sent into the
party to investigate. If alcohol
was being served to those under
age, the party was closed and
charges were pressed against

“T like to think of myself as
being reasonable,” Sutton told
the fraternity officers. ‘‘Rea-
sonableness in enforcement is
important, but enforcement
there will be.”’

“I’m not going to be going
around smelling everybody’s
cups,”’ he continued, ‘“‘but if
there are 17- and 18-year-olds
getting crocked and stumbling
around, I’m going to do some-
thing about it.’’

And so it seems that the
fraternities have been given
enough rope to either rescue or
hang themselves. Which will
happen depends entirely on
their ability to walk the straight
and narrow line of ‘“reason-
able”’ security.

Paper is starting on shaky ground

By SCOTT MASON

Spring term seems just a
short time ago. The front lawn
of the Colonnade was littered
with would-be lacrosse players,
shirtless frisbee throwers, and
sun-bathers greased with body
oil.

Summer has breezed by. Last
year’s seniors are gone, this
year’s freshmen have arrived,
new professors have replaced
old, and the Ring-tum Phi has
changed hands.

Chief Editors Rick Swagler
and John Cleghorn are seeking
changes in the Phi — upgrading
the writing, offering a wider
variety of articles, improving
the way the Phi looks and reads.
But the new editors begin their
job on shaky ground.

Generally, the purpose of any
newspaper is to accurately in-
form its readers of what’s going
on around them. When a news-
paper fails to report meaningful
events, its readers are cheated
out of news which may affect
them.

It’s essential that Swagler
and Cleghorn ensure that the
Phi properly covers the news,
especially in light of an incident
last May.

It’s been the policy of the Phi

to cover weekly Executive
Committee meetings no matter
how boring or how trivial the
agenda. And so it should. The
Executive Committee is the
voice of the student body, com-
posed of at least one represen-
tative from each class.

Few realize the enormous
power and responsibility of the
EC. In addition to handling
disciplinary matters, it controls
the purse strings of nearly
every university subcommittee.
It could, for example, take

Readers’
Advocate

away all funds from the Student
Activities Board. That would
mean no Tuesdays in the Pit, no
Fancy Dress, no Homecoming
or Spring weekends.

 

Last May, Bill Roberts, then
editor-in-chief, decided the Phi
would not cover an Executive
Committee meeting involving
White Book revisions (rule
changes). At that meeting, the
Committee discussed the defini-
tion of an honor violation. Ac-

cording to the White Book, an
honor violation is committed
when a person lies, cheats or
steals. The EC debated extend-
ing that definition to include ly-
ing, cheating, stealing, and
other actions generally thought

 

Scott Mason

to be disreputable. This, for ex-
ample, would have made using
drugs an honor violation. As it
stands now, using or selling
drugs is “‘legal’’ in the eyes of
the university.

Roberts did show up at the
Committee’s next meeting and
was asked why the Phi wasn’t
present the week before.
Roberts reply was ‘Who
cares?” A heated argument en-
sued between Roberts and the

Behind the Readers’ Advocate

By RICK SWAGLER
Chief Editor

This year’s Ring-tum Phi will
include a forum for students to
praise or criticize the paper
edited by senior Scott Mason.

As the ‘“‘Readers’ Advocate,”’
Mason will criticize or praise
the Phi’s coverage and if
necessary explain the reason-
ing behind editorial decisions.
Mason will also make sugges-
tions for correcting any inac-
curacies or imbalances. In
short, he will voice the concerns
of the readers.

By way of _ introduction,
Mason is a senior from South
Dartmouth, Mass., majoring in

journalism. Last year, he serv-
ed as junior representative on
the Executive Committee.

Last spring, he worked as a
reporter at the Roanoke World-
Times and during the summer
he was a reporter for the CBS
television affiliate in Rich-
mond, WTVR-TV.

At W&L, he has been a report-
er for the Phi, an anchor and
producer of the WLUR-FM
news program ‘‘Meridian”’ and
a news anchor for the evening
news on W&L’s cable television
station, Cable 9.

Mason was chosen for the
position because of his variety
of experience in both W&L stu-

dent government and _ jour-
nalism. We hope this will give
him a unique perspective from
which to comment.

Anyone with questions or
comments concerning the ac-
curacy or fairness of any ar-
ticles should contact Scott
Mason at 463-6861. Mason will
investigate the complaint, if
necessary, and publish a cor-
rection if warranted.

Committee over what the Phi
should and should not be re-
sponsible for printing. Insults
flew, and at least one member
of the EC voted to reprimand
Roberts.

Also present was Rick
Swagler. Swagler, already
named as one of next year’s
editors, was asked what he
thought of the Phi’s absence at
the meeting held the week
earlier. His reply was that the

Phi will cover what it deems is
news, that it will cover EC
meetings if the Committee
stops looking over the Phi’s
shoulder and telling the Phi
what it should print.

The Ring-tum Phi has a duty
to cover every Executive Com-
mittee whether the EC “‘looks
over its shoulder’ or not. The
EC often makes important deci-
sions which affect students, and

it’s the Phi’s responsibility to
provide this information so that
students are aware of what
decisions do affect them and
how they affect them.

People do care about what
goes on inside the EC room.
But, if the Phi doesn’t cover EC
meetings people won’t be allow-
ed the opportunity to care and

will be cheated out of news
which could have an impact on
them.

This year the Phi may find
other committees “‘looking over
its shoulder.’ Those in charge
of Mock Convention may, for
example, press the Phi for
coverage or point out conven-
tion events it deems important
to print. That’s no reason for the
Phi to retaliate by not giving
any coverage of the event. It’s
news, and failure to cover the
event would be irresponsible.

The meeting the Phi missed
last May involved a controver-
sial subject and was one of the
most important EC meetings of
the year. The Phi, however,
didn’t just fail to carry out its
responsibility as a newspaper;
it missed an opportunity to
capitalize on a delicate topic af-
fecting all W&L students and to
editorialize or provide its own
opinion on the matter.

It’s important for Swagler
and Cleghorn to realize their
responsibilities from the start
and to cover the news no matter
who’s looking over the Phi’s
Shoulder. The ground they
begin on is shaky. It’s up to
them to smooth the road ahead.

St. Clair said that the 150
dancers deserved a great deal
of the credit for the Super-
dance’s success. Students from
W&L, Hollins College, Southern
Seminary, Sweet Briar College,
Mary Baldwin College, Ran-

danced in the Superdance.

Paper’s history one of perseverance

By JOHN CLEGHORN

The managing editor leaned
back smugly in his desk chair
and glanced over the clips the
student had submitted in ap-
plication for the summer intern-
ship.

The student sat anxiously
across the desk. The word pro-
cessors tapped quietly in the
newsroom outside the door.

The managing editor flipped
through the articles a last time
and looked up at the student.

“Your resume looks 0.k. and
your clips are pretty good,” he
said, ‘‘but there is one thing.”’

“Yes sir, what’s that?’’ the
nervous applicant shot back.

“What the HELL is the Ring-
tum Phi?”’

It was the year 1897. Henry
Ford was having his first
thoughts about a horseless car-
riage and the Wright brothers
were hard at work in their bicy-
cle shop, laying down the
original plans for something
called an airplane. William Jen-
nings Bryan was trying to con-
vince America that he would be
as effective in the oval office as
in the courtroom.

And in Lexington, several en-
thusiastic young men‘ had
started the first weekly news-
paper at Washington and Lee.

It was a group of wide varie-
ty, that first editorial board.
Members came from Texas,
Missouri, West Virginia, Ken-
tucky and Virginia. You get the
impression that these fellows
were sports buffs at heart. In
the first issue, they stated clear-
ly that their rebel publication
would not rival the Southern
Collegian, the ruling W&L
publication at the time.

Instead, these guys stuck to
sports. Singing and chanting
was the rage at the time and so

these characters decided to
name their new paper after a
popular football cheer. It went
like this:

Ring-tum Phi, stickeri bum,

We’re hot stuff from Lex-
ington

Kah, rah, rah, White and Blue

Whoopla, Whoopla, W.L.U.

Stickert Bum

Yes, they did a lot of cheering
back then. A new cheer was
printed in every edition so the
more fair-hearted minks could
cheer on their more sturdy
associates in the trenches. In
addition to the cheers, there
were previews of games, statis-
tics and more songs. Sports fill-
ed the front page, the editorial
columns and the adver-
tisements.

With the turn of the century,
the young paper published a
revolutionary idea: Photo-
graphs. The 1903 graduation
edition included pictures of the
colonnade and the members of
the graduating class. Consider-
ing that the camera was only in-
vented in the 1890s, the editors
must have felt pretty proud.

Through the years, the paper
grew in strength and populari-
ty. Much to the chagrin of the
founding editors, more news
was included later in the four
page weekly.

Veeceseceeesecessesos

In 1921, the paper reported
that the academic average for
the members of the ten frater-
nities on campus was a dismal
71, But on the brighter side, the
paper gladly announced that
the university co-op would re-
open its doors ‘‘for the first time
since the war.”

After a period of growth for
the fraternity system, the paper
came out strongly against haz-
ing. One editorial called for the
end of the weekly beatings of
freshmen pledges.

Fate brought an end to such
menial subjects a decade later.

In the heightening threat of
the second world conflict, one
editorial called for students to
attend to their studies while ‘‘on
borrowed time’’ at the universi-
ty. In the same issue the State
Theatre showed its patriotism
by advertising the newest Hol-
lywood release; “Desperate
Journey’ starring Ronald
Reagan and Errol Flynn.

Slowly the student body and
the Ring-tum Phi staff fell vic-
tim to the attrition of war until
one issue reported that the
paper had ‘“‘ground to a stop.”’
The Phi was not published for
the next two years.

eeverseceeeccccccsese

But the beleaguered young
journalists could not be held
down for long and in 1946 the
Phi came roaring back into
publication and _ popularity.
Assuming the same appearance
and role in the university, the
Phi retook its place and has
been published weekly since
then.

You hold in your hands a
Ring-tum Phi with a purpose
very much the same as that
published since the turn of the
century. The tradition and
history of the W&L weekly
make it a unique and perserver-
ing publication. Much like that
original group of editors, stern
and energetic in their high-
button suit-coats and their
starch-stiff collars, it is the in-
tent and responsibility of the
staff to uphold and improve on
that history.

Orientation called ragged

By NELSON PATTERSON
Staff Reporter

The freshman class under-
went a “ragged’’ orientation
last week, according to the
Dean of Freshmen, H. Robert
Huntley.

“Orientation (this year) was
ragged,’’ Huntley said, blaming
the uneasy period on late or
forgetful speakers, not
students.

“There was a problem with
two many athletic tests at dif-
ferent times which rushed
freshmen meetings with ad-
visers,’’ Huntley added.

This year’s orientation
schedule had several changes.
Freshmen met their advisers
for the first time on an
“academic”’ basis, a change
preferred by the majority of ad-
visers according to Huntley. In
the past, freshmen had a more
social first meeting with their
advisers highlighted by dinner
together and dessert at the ad-

viser’s home. Though freshmen
still went to the advisers’ homes
after the first meeting, numer-
ous events on campus cut short
most of the meetings and led to
many faculty complaints.

While the schedule may have
appeared ‘‘ragged”’ to Huntley,
he spoke highly of their
cooperation and courtesy dur-
ing the week.

One freshman counselor,
Chris Cartmill, also had high
marks for the freshmen’s first
week and the class as a whole.

“They seem to be more ma-
ture than last year’s class,”
noted Cartmill, a second-year
counselor.

Cartmill also felt the orienta-
tion process had several loop-
holes, especially when it came
to the explanation of frater-
nities and the Rush system.

“Who is there to really help
them in the decision ‘process?
Rush questions abound,’’ Cart-
mill said.

New Jersey, also felt the Rush
orientation left many questions
unanswered.

“At the Rush meeting, they
talked about nothing we didn’t
already know or had already
thought about,’’ Spear said.

Spear’s classmate, Jeff Duke,
agreed, noting that rush
vocabulary — ‘rush date,’ ‘bid,’
etc. — had never been ade-
quately explained.

Dean Dan Murphy, Inter-
fraternity Council adviser,
believed this year’s Rush orien-
tation had gone better than in
previous years.

‘About two-thirds to three-
quarters of the freshmen at-
tended Rush orientation,’ Mur-
phy estimated. ‘‘Some fresh-
men had conflicts due to
athletic meetings.”

Murphy also believed the
Rush presentation was ‘‘clearly
presented and understood.’’

Confusion abounded not only
in the area of Rush and frater-
nities, but also in freshmen
questions about the Honor Code.
Len Howard, secretary of the
EC, thought this year’s session
with the freshmen went
smoothly, though he thought
freshmen’s fear of the Honor
System was unfounded and
often turned to the humorous
side. .

“One freshman wondered if
sleeping over at Sweet Briar
was an H.V.,’’ Howard joked.

The numbers on the frosh

Washington and _ Lee’s
freshman class ‘‘just might be a
unique bunch,’ according to
Robert Huntley, dean of W&L
freshmen.

Statistically, this year’s 360
entering freshmen are very
similar to those of previous
years, yet Huntley adds that
they seem to be more compati-
ble.

‘“‘When they’re walking
around the campus in groups of
six or eight, two or more of
them will always speak. Or-
dinarily peer pressure doesn’t
permit that sort of thing,’
Huntley said.

Huntley also added that he
was surprised at how well the
freshmen coped with ‘‘one of

the most miserably hot orienta-
tion weeks in living memory.”

This year’s freshman class
was chosen from a pool of 1,562
applications and include 14
students who finished first or
second in their graduating
class. Twelve incoming fresh-
men were National Merit
Scholarship finalists and six
freshmen received W&L honor
scholarships. The average
Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT)
scores for the new students
were 555 verbal and 595 math.

Members of the class of 1987
come from 280 secondary
schools and represent 32 states
and 7 foreign countries. The
largest group (61) comes from
the commonwealth of Virginia.
New York was second with 43,
followed by New Jersey (30),
Maryland (28), Pennsylvania
(22), Texas (21) and Florida
(18).

Similar to last year, 60 per-
cent of the freshmen attended
public or parochial high schools
while the remaining 40 percent
came from independent
schools.

Washington and Lee awarded
some sort of financial aid to 109
new freshmen, of which 42 were
ranked in the top tenth of their
class.

Overall, 892 students were of-
fered admission to’ W&L with
the 360 deciding to attend.

ummertime:when business is slow

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

If you think Lexington curls
up and goes to sleep during the
summer as might be expected
in a city of 7,300 people — when

nearly 3,000 students head home
for the summer — you’re only
partially correct.

According to area merchants,
business is not that bad during
the summer. Lexington’s tour-
ist trade, summer school at Vir-

ginia Military Institute and the |

various alumni programs at
Washington and Lee pick up the
slack during the summer.

Estimates of the drop in sales ™
ranged from 35 to 40 percent at *

 

close a half-hour earlier during
the week and at 1 p.m. on Satur-
days.

While business at the College
Town Shop is not hurt that much
during the summer, business at
Alvin-Dennis ‘‘drops off a lot,”’
Alvin Carter said.

‘‘We do miss the students in
the summer,’”’ Carter con-
tinued. ‘“You wonder some days
in the summer what you’re go-
ing to do. But we’re still moving
merchandise.”’

ae

Spanky’s restaurant to no drop =

at all at the College Town Shop
clothing store, according to an
informal Ring-tum Phi survey.

Jayne Plogger, assistant
manager of Spanky’s, describ-
ed the summer drop in business
as ‘“‘quite a bit.” She added,
though, that ‘‘this summer was
stronger than usual.” The
restaurant still had an esti-
mated 40 percent drop in sales.

At the other extreme is the
College Town Shop, where co-
owner Martha Derrick said;
“It’s a strange phenom-
enon...business doesn’t drop
off.’

“It’s a different business
(during the summer). It
changes as far as the customer
and what they purchase, but it
doesn’t change in volume due to
the conferences at the schools,
the tourist season and the local
people going on vacation who
want new clothes.”

Only two afternoons this sum-
mer were absolutely dead,’’ Ms.
Derrick said.

The College Town Shop, along
with several other merchants in
town, including Alvin-Dennis,
decided several years ago to
shorten their hours slightly dur-
ing the summer. The stores

v

 

Carter said the slowest period
of the summer is the end of July
and the beginning of August,
but the store still manages to
pick up some of the local trade
and tourism.

Alvin-Dennis’ sales, never-
theless, drop between five and
30 percent during the summer,
Carter said.

Business at the Palms
restaurant ‘“‘actually doesn’t
drop off that much because we
do a good tourism business,”

One of the casualties of the summer business lag is the White Col-

owner Jay Korn said. However
the restaurant does see about a
15 percent decrease in business.

“If we were not a college
town, I could survive.’”’ Korn
added.

Although the absence of
students is felt at McCrum’s
drugstore, another factor con-
tributes to a decline in business
there during the summer
—people just don’t get as sick as
often according to Jerry Robin-
son, manager.

“‘The business is slow in the
summer, and then it does pick
up in the fall,’ Robinson said.
“‘The students are gone and the

| people are on vacation and out
| swimming and enjoying the
| weather.”’

Sam Moore, owner of the

White Front Grocery, said his

business drops about 20 percent
during the summer. “It’s a
nine-month business town. Any

time volume’s down 20 percent,
it hurts. But you get used to the
ebbs and flows.”

Lexington’s tourism trade
does help businesses during the
summer, said Martha Doss,
director of tourism for the city.
During the summer of 1981,
17,697 visitors passed through
the visitor’s center.

That number increased 6.5
percent to 18,856 in the summer
of 1982 when the World’s Fair in
Knoxville brought many tour-
ists down Interstate 81, and
through the town.

The number of visitors this
summer was down slightly to
18,779.

Ms. Doss is one Lexingtonian
who enjoys the peace and quiet
of Lexington in the summer.
“During the summer, it’s so
delightful around here,” she
said. “even parking is very
easy.”

Sigma Nu returns to W&L
with help from headquarters

By TORI RICHARDSON
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee com-
munity began its 1983-84 year by
welcoming one of its oldest in-
stitutions back on campus, the
Sigma Nu Fraternity. Having
had its Charter suspended in the
Fall of 1981 after accumulating
$10,000 in debts and failing to
repay loans made by the na-
tional fraternity, the Sigma Nu
fraternity was able to obtain the
permission and funds needed to
reorganize the house and to
repair damages.

Chris John, president of the
W&L chapter, said the Sigma
Nu headquarters, located in
Lexington, played a major part

in the re-establishment: of the
campus chapter. ‘‘This - past
April the W&L chapter of Sigma
Nu celebrated its centennial. At
that time, the national reac-
tivated the chapter’s charter
and informed us of the money

being raised to finance the

renovation of the house,’’ John
said.

Two representatives from the
national headquarters had in-
itiated John and three others
during the Fall of 1982 rush
period. Seven other members
were initiated later in the year.

According to John, the plans
to re-establish the house started
in the summer of 1982.

director of the Sigma Nu na-

had asked if I would be in-

‘the chapter on campus. He

mentioned the importance of
having the house reorgainzed
for the centennial celebration.
And I saw this as a good oppor-
tunity to have a new fraternity
on campus that would have a
positive influence on the rest of
the houses.”

suspended after the university
stopped recognizing it as a
fraternity. The house also had
problems with its neighbors and
had violated many standards
and warnings set by the univer-
sity.

The house, which was exten-
sively damaged by a mysteri-
ous fire set a year ago, required
extensive restoration. Accor-
ding to Mo Littlefield, executive
director of the Sigma Nu na-
tional, much of the money was
obtained from money raised by
Sigma Nu alumni, the national
chapter, and Washington and
Lee.

“The University and the na-
tional chapter were very sup-
portive in helping the house to

   

re-establish ground on campus
out of the $50,000 given to the
W&L chapter, about one-third

.of it came from the university

and the other two-thirds from
alumni and the national.”’

Sigma Nu, which now has 11
members living in the house, is
now financially solvent, accord-
ing to John.

“We got about 60 guys to sign
up for open house this week. I
am sure that the present state
of the house may deter some
guys from pledging our house.
However, the new Sigma Nu
isn’t looking for numbers, we’re
looking for a diverse group of

guys who can add plenty to the
house. We don’t want the same
problems to reoccur.”

Fight teachers join W&L faculty

By DAVID W. JOHNSTON
Staff Reporter

With the start of classes this
week eight teachers joined
Washington and Lee’s
undergraduate faculty, and the
law school gained two.

Joining the undergraduate
faculty were: Joseph Martinez,
assistant professor of drama;
Capt. John D. Smith, assistant
professor of military science;
Lyn F. Wheeler, assistant pro-
fessor of accounting; Jean C.
Dunbar, assistant professor of
English; Robert I. Tharp, in-
structor in art; Ann Taylor
Thornton, part time instructor

in music; Henry Sharp Jr., pro-
fessor of mathematics, Peggy
Hays, assistant professor and
reference and public services
librarian; and Dennis Daly,
assistant professor of physical
education and head lacrosse
coach.

Martha I. Morgan, visiting
associate professor of law, and
Joan M. Shaughnessy, assistant
professor of law were the addi-
tions to the law school faculty.

Martinez plans to “‘[revamp]
the entire acting program.”’
During the next five years he
hopes to increase the number of
drama majors, build a new
theatre, initiate exchange pro-
grams with nearby women’s

 

colleges, and produce plays that
will be more popular with both
drama students and their au-
dience.

Some of the changes will be
apparent in the first production
this year, which will include a
number of samurai sword
fights; stage fighting being one
of Martinez’ specialties. Stunt-
men’s unions have prevented
him from practicing this in the
United States, but he has been
involved in shows that have
toured Europe. Martinez feels
this European experience is im-
portant because it gives a ‘“‘dif-
ferent perspective of the
theatre.”’

John D. Smith, assistant professor of military science; Joan M. Shaughnessy, assistant professor of
law; Lyn F. Wheeler, assistant professor of accounting; (standing from left), Joseph Martinez, assis-
tant professor of drama; Sgt. Ray Kuper, operations sergeant in the university’s ROTC detachment;
Dennis Daly, assistant professor of physical education and head lacrosse coach; Henry Sharpe Jr., pro-
fessor of mathematics; Jean C. Dunbar, assistant professor of English; and, Martha I. Morgan, visiting

Increasing the number of
drama majors to about fifty —
W&L has about 20 now — is
high on Martinez’ list of
priorities. However, at the
same time he wants to keep the
size of the department small
enough to allow a maximum
amount of personal contact,
which he says is one of W&L’s
strong points.

One major weakness, though,
is the lack of women to play
leading roles. By starting an ex-
change program with neighbor-
ing women’s schools (with
whom he has already started
talks) he hopes to remedy this
problem. In addition to increas-
ing the involvement of college
women, Martinez says increas-
ing participation by community
residents, especially in roles un-
suited for college men, is high
on his agenda.

One of the more difficult pro-
jects Martinez has assigned
himself is the construction of a
new theatre. Here he has a
powerful ally in President
Wilson, who has pointed out the
shortcomings in W&L’s theatre
facilities. Plans for a ‘‘very
functional’’ new theatre,
possibly to be built at the site of
the old train station, have
already drawn up, and Mar-
tinez says he hopes construction
can start as soon as possible.

To go with the new theatre the
former University of Illinois
teacher hopes to initiate a new
line of plays, using surveys of
faculty and students to deter-
mine which plays will have the
most appeal and benefit.
However, he hastens to add, the
program will still cover all the
genres of theatre every four
years, so students can be expos-
ed to the full range of the
theatrical experience.

First meeting

 

Executive
Committee

sworn-in

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

Nine executive committee
members, including student
body president Bob Jenevein,
were sworn in Monday night by
Dean Lewis John during the
EC’s first meeting of the school
year.

After the swearing-in, the
meeting was devoted to an-
nouncements and reports from
the Cold Check Committee, the
Emergency Student Loan Com-
mittee and the Student
Telephone Union.

A topic of discussion for each
of the three organizations was
collection of money from
graduated students.

Each committee has sent let-
ters to these alumni and is
holding their transcripts until
the money is repaid.

Additional methods for
collecting the money were sug-
gested by EC members. These
included sending letters to the
parents and having the EC’s at-
torney write letters to the
students.

Jenevein announced the for-

James Cook Jr.,
music professor,

dies at age 51

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

James Tucker Cook Jr., assis-
tant professor of music at
Washington and Lee, died at the
age of 51 this summer.

The death on July 5 in a
Waynesboro hospital was re-
portedly the result of lung
cancer.

In August, the university
received a gift of $25,000 from

 

The Ring-tum Phi, September 15, 1983, Page 11

an anonymous donor to estab-
lish an endowed scholarship in
his memory.

According to university of-
ficials, the James Tucker Cook
Jr. Memorial Scholarship will
be awarded to a W&L student
who has demonstrated financial
need and is an active partici-
pant in the music curriculum of
the Fine Arts department.

Cook, a 1954 graduate of
W&L, received his master’s
degree from Columbia. He
taught music at a number of in-
stitutions, including Mary
Baldwin College, before return-
ing to his alma mater in 1968.

An accomplished organist
and pianist, Cook’s specialty

Robert Stewart, head of the
music department, said that
Cook was ‘“‘a thorough, com-
plete musician’ whose “‘first
love was his studio.”

“He always had a solid
outlook,” Stewart said. ‘‘He
was not, like most musicians,
moody.”

Stewart remembers Cook as
“an inspirational teacher” who
“was always interested in his
students’ welfare.’’

The music history courses
Cook taught will not be offered
again until next fall, when a
full-time replacement for him
will be hired. According to
Stewart, the selection process is

H. Marshall Jarrett, a pro-
fessor at Washington and Lee
since 1963, was named by the
University Board of Trustees
this summer to succeed William
A. Jenks as head of the depart-
ment of history.

Jenks, who served the univer-
sity beginning in 1946, retired in
May after chairing the depart-
ment for twelve years. Jarrett
assumed his position on July 1.

William J. Watt, Dean of the
College, said that Jarrett was
chosen by the Trustees on the
advice of University President
John D. Wilson. Jarrett had
been recommended to Wilson
by the President’s Advisory
Committee, which consists of
the three academic deans and
three elected professors.

Watt said that all members of
the history department were
consulted during the selection
process.

A graduate of Washington
and Lee, Jarrett received his
master’s degree and Ph.D.
from Duke University, where
he concentrated his studies in
the French Revolution and the

 

Jarrett named department head

intellectual history of the 18th
and 19th centuries.

The Oklahoma native, who
has conducted historical re-
search in Europe, taught at
Duke and at Westminster Col-
lege in Maryland before joining
the W&L faculty.

Jenks was quite enthusiastic
regarding the appointment of
Jarrett. ‘“‘He is an extremely
competent colleague,” Jenks
said. ‘‘He has been at my right
hand all the years I chaired the
department...I’m delighted he
got the job.”’

Jenks, who said that he could
always depend on Jarrett for
‘“‘good advice,’ said that Jar-
rett did an excellent job of fill-
ing in for him as department
head when Jenks’s work took
him abroad.

“T really have retired,’’ Jenks
said following a vacation to
Mexico. “‘I make it a point to not
even go into the office to pick up
my mail. The department needs

 

Don’t wait in slow lines
for fast food.

 

a clean transfer of administra-
tion.”

Jarrett stated that his pre-
decessors have given him a
“hard act to follow.” “‘I hope at
minimum to keep it like it is,”’
he said with a short laugh.

“Since I was a student here,”’
he said, ‘‘we’ve had four depart-
ment heads. Throughout that
period, the quality of the
department has been very
high...Those men are responsi-
ble for building a strong depart-
ment. It is that tradition of
leadership that I hope to
uphold.”

“The department at the mo-
ment is very strong,” he con-
tinued, ‘“‘but we don’t want to
seem self-satisfied or rest on
our laurels. My goal is to main-
tain our present strength and
look to the future with op-
timism.”’

According to Jarrett, all of
the department’s ‘‘bases are
covered,” except for an Islamic

history course which Jenks
taught. Jarrett said that al-
though this field is ‘certainly
important,’’ the class will tem-
porarily not be offered.

The immediate concern con-
fronting the department, Jar-
rett said, is the curriculum
change approved last spring.
He said that some adjustments
will have to be made, and that
the department would be wat-
ching to see how the alterations
‘“‘will affect our position and

teaching mission. We’ve been
flexible in the past, and we plan
to continue in that direction.”

Jarrett said it’s ‘‘very ex-
citing’’ to work with profes-
sionals like those in the history
department. ‘“‘There is good
variety among our faculty,’’ he
said. ‘“‘They’re very active and
productive, and our new mem-
bers have made a big contribu-
tion to the department.”’

He cites as key strengths the
use of ‘“‘innovative, creative
teaching methods’ and the
wide range of available classes.

‘“‘We cover not only the tradi-
tional European and American
history, but also Latin
American, Far Eastern, Afri-
can, and Indian history as
well,” he continued.

Thousands of Army ROTC graduates, from hundreds of

Some enrolled in ROTC for financial aid to complete col-

ROTC scholarships). Others for the management training
and experience offered by Army ROTC courses. Still others
for the positions of immediate leadership responsibility
following graduation, as officers in the active Army,
Reserves, and Army National Guard.

But most enrolled also to serve their country. Men from
the north, the east, the south, the west ... from small urban

Progress pleases Fallon

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

After losing two veteran
quarterbacks whom he thought
would be returning, head coach
Gary Fallon is now starting a
sophomore who has yet to take
a college snap from center.
You’d think he’d be a little bit
worried about his chances. On
the contrary, the Generals
sixth-year leader has nothing
but praise for his new signal
caller, Bobby Wilson, and says
of the entire squad, ‘‘This is the
hardest working group I’ve

ever had.”’

' The 1983 Generals are solid
everywhere, but their greatest
strength most certainly is the
veteran offensive line. ‘‘No
question about it,”’ notes Fallon,
“that (the offensive line) is the
strength. They led our offense
in’ pre-season. They make no
mistakes.”

The line is anchored by two
time All-ODAC first team
center, senior Glenn Kirschner.
Kirschner is flanked by two All-
ODAC second team guards,
seniors Dan Seal and Craig
Reilly. Rounding out W&L’s

five blocks of granite are
veteran tackles Jim Koenig, a
senior, and Pat O’Connell, a
junior.

The Generals’ backfield was
hurt by graduation and the
departure of quarterbacks Al
Paradise and John Thompson.
Gone are standout performers
Ken Robinson and All-ODAC
first team tailback Chris
Cavalline. Coach Fallon has
these shoes filled quite well
already, commenting, “It’s as
strong a backfield as we’ve ever
had.”’

Wilson, who Fallon calls ‘‘the
quarterback’s quarterback,”
has all of the head coach’s con-
fidence. ‘“‘Bobby has been most
impressive. He has taken over
the leadership role quite well.’’
Completing the W&L backfield
will be Fallon’s “runaway
truck,”’ sophomore Frank Sur-
face and getting the nod at
tailback will be junior Gene
Girard, who will be followed by
sophomore Chris Bleggi and
freshman pleasant surprise
Michael Weaver, as Fallon
hopes to utilize ‘‘fresh legs as
often as we can.”

‘“‘’m not sure how this team

though,” promised Fallon. It

tween the two schools, dating
back to 1921. The series is tied

Water polo to defend title

By DAVE NAVE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
water polo team looks forward
to winning its third consecutive
Southern League Championship
as head coach Page Remillard
nears his 100th victory as a
water polo coach at W&L. The
Generals begin their 1983 tour-
nament schedule’ Friday
September 16 at 7:30 p.m. when
they play the University of
Arkansas at Little Rock in the
W&L Fall Classic. The tourna-
ment will be played at the
Warner Center and will also in-
clude teams from Navy, Buck-
nell, Johns-Hopkins, UNC
Wilmington, Richmond, and a
W&L B team.

Evaluating the 1983 season
Remillard said, ‘‘We’ll take our
lumps at the beginning of the
season, but we will play very
well at tournament time.” The
starting line-up for this year’s
team is stronger than last
year’s, but this year’s team
lacks depth. According to Coach
Remillard, ‘‘This year’s start-
ing lineup would beat last
year’s, but last year’s bench

would rip this year’s apart.’’ He
believes, however, that the
depth of the team will improve
as the 14 freshmen improve.

Coach Remillard does not
believe that this year’s team
will win as many games as last
year’s team (26-9) saying, ‘“We
play a much tougher schedule
this year.’’ W&L’s 1983 schedule
includes several encounters
with Navy, Bucknell, Brown,
Slippery Rock and Richmond.
Coach Remillard also states,
“We’ve added two weekend
dates to our schedule which in-
volve several of the top ten
teams on the East coast.

The loss of All-American Erik
Peterson will be offset by a very
strong starting line-up. The 1983
team will feature a team that
revolves around a team concept
instead of revolving around a
single player. ‘‘I am very ex-
cited about the starting line-up.
We have six players who com-
plement each other and want to
help each other win,’’ said
Remillard.

Three co-captains will be
leading the Generals this year.

they are seniors Matt Raven-
craft, Tim Rock and Don Smith.
Ravencraft was tied for second
as a leading scorer and led the
team in assists last year. Bobby
Pearson, who Remillard says is
a very smart player and the
real thinker in the offense, will
also make a significant con-
tribution to the starting line-up.
Much improved sophomores
Ken Johnstone and Tim Stan-
ford are also members of the
starting line-up.

Washington and Lee will
enter a B team in the Fall
Classic this weekend. The team
will primarily consist of
freshmen. The B team plays
their first match of the tourna-
ment against Navy at 5 p.m.
Friday. The purpose of the B
team’s participation is that the
freshmen will acquire some of
the experience needed to help
the entire water polo team im-
prove. Remillard is confident
that his team will improve as
the season progresses. He
stated: “Among East coast
teams W&L has a reputation of
improving a great deal from the
beginning of the season to the
end.”’

Piranian thinking big

By RICK PIERCE
Staff Writer

The 1983 edition of Generals’
soccer is about to unfold as the
booters open their season on
Tuesday against the rival
Royals of Eastern Mennonite.
Game time is 3:30 at Wilson
Field.

The Generals, who finished a
close second in the ODAC (3-1-2
in the conference, and 8-3-2
overall) a year ago, will aim to
better last season’s perfor-
mance. Under the direction of
sixth-year head coach Rolf
Piranian, the Generals will aim
for the NCAA playoffs, a goal
that eluded them last season.

The Generals will have strong
leadership on the field in the
presence of senior co-captain
Roland Simon at center forward
and junior co-captain Rob Cole-
man at sweeper back. W&L’s
soccer program is also pleased
with the return of junior Mark
Sullivan at center midfielder
after a year’s absence. Sullivan
was All-ODAC two seasons ago.

The talent does not stop there,
however, Coach Piranian, who
must replace six starters lost
through graduation, feels,
“Last season we were deep and
now this season those that
played on the B team are ready
to step right in. We also have a
fine crop of freshmen who will

add to our depth.”’

During preseason practices
Piranian felt that they were
very strong offensively. ‘“‘We
are going to be exciting on of-
fense and we will score a lot of
goals,’’ Piranian noted. He also
commented that defensively the
Generals will need some work.

The Generals in pre-season
polls were picked to finish third
this season in the ODAC behind
Lynchburg and Roanoke. How-
ever, Piranian feels differently,
“I believe this is the year that
we can emerge from the pack
and win the conference title.”
The Generals will be hoping to
better last season’s 1-1 overtime
tie with the Royals.

Athletics fills new posts

Long helps lax

Jeffrey J. Long, an All-
America lacrosse player at the
U.S. Naval Academy in the mid-
1970’s has joined the Washing-
ton and Lee University athletic
department as. an assistant
lacrosse coach.

Long, 27, will work with new
head coach Dennis Daly to
diréct the Generals’ program.

A native of Rochester, New
York, Long comes to W&L after
serving one year as graduate
assistant lacrosse and soccer
coach at Alfred University in
upstate New York, where he
received his Master’s degree in
education.

He earned USILA All-
America honors in 1975, 1976

_ and 1977 as a record-setting
attack-man at Navy, where he
received his undergraduate
degree in political science. He
was first-team All-America as a
senior in 1977 when he scored 22
goals and handed out a school
record 53 assists.

In addition to the single-
season assist record Long holds
Navy marks for career assists
(149), career points (233), and
most assists in one game (nine

vs. Hofstra in 1976).

He played in the 1977 North-
South All-Star Game and on the
U.S. team in the 1978 World
Games.

O’Connel promoted

Chuck O’Connell, a member
of the Washington and Lee
athletic department coaching
staff since 1973, has been pro-
moted to assistant athletic
director with responsibility fur
the department’s financial mat-
ters.

“The fine administrative
skills Chuck demonstrated dur-
ing his coaching tenure made
him the natural candidate for
this position,’ stated W&L
Director of Athletics Bill
McHenry, who announced the
promotion on Sept. 1. ‘We have
full confidence he will handle
his new responsibilities effec-
tively and accurately.”

O’Connell, who will continue
as an assistant football coach
and assistant professor of
physical education, takes the
new reins from Jack Emmer,
who in July resigned to become
head lacrosse coach and assis-
tant athletic director at Army.
An eleven-year member of the

W&L department, Emmer had
been assistant athletic director
since 1978.

O’Connell joined the W&L
staff in the summer of 1973 as
offensive line coach for the foot-
ball team, He switched to de-
fense beginning with the 1975
season and became defensive
coordinator in 1978. He was also
an assistant lacrosse coach for
the 1974 through 1983 seasons.

Washington and Lee graduate
Robert S. Newcomb of
Barnardsville, N.J., has return-
ed to the University to serve as
a graduate assistant coach for
the swimming and water polo
teams.

He joins fifth-year aquatics
director Page Remillard, who
coached him during his senior
year.

Newcomb, who holds a 1980
degree in natural science, earn-
ed four W&L letters in swim-
ming and three in water polo.
As a senior he won All-Southern
League water polo honors, serv-
ed as swim team captain, and

...1f I’m not mistaken it’s that
time of year again when the
leaves begin to change colors
and the aroma of cocaine is in
the air. Yes’ that’s right it’s
time for the National Football
League (with an “‘N,”’ as oppos-
ed to ‘‘U.S.”’) A drug problem in
the NFL? Well, at least now we
know why the big boys keep
holding out for the money. Ac-
tually, I’m rather nauseated by
the ‘‘Athletes are people, too’
excuse. That only goes so far.
No amount of stress justifies
drug use. What’s more, the
damage to the NFL caused by
this problem has for all intents
and purposes gone by uncheck-
ed. Sure, there will be fines and
suspensions, but after rehabili-
tation many offenders will be
back. I’d like to believe the
athlete had earned the right to
be put on a pedestal and
respected. But these involved in
the drug scandal have forfeited
that right and it’s not something
they deserve to reclaim...

...Now, on to some more good
news. Speaking of the summer
there were two stories worth a
second look. First, in late June
we learned of a problem in the
tennis world as Guillermo Vilas
was charged with accepting a
guaranteed sum of money for
appearing in a tennis tourna-
ment. The case has yet to be
resolved, and whatever deci-
sion is reached, no one will be
satisfied. However, the point is
that everyone in men’s tennis
freely admits to the existence of
guarantees in the game. Given,
they are not necessary. On the
other hand,.we are dealing with
professionals, people whose
livelihood is this sport. Why not
try to make as much as you are
worth? Also, it would seem that
the “guarantee” is actually a
reward in that only those whose
appearance in the tournament
would be beneficial to the tour-
nament are paid guarantees.
Therefore, are these ‘‘guaran-
tees’ much different than
bonuses paid to football and
baseball players? Think about
it...

...The other topic of interest
of the summer of ’83 was, of
course, the use of anabolic
steroids. Are 80 percent of the
world’s athletes so stupid? Very

em Drugs ‘R’ Us

sad and, unfortunately, very
true. The people who use these
drugs, which aid in muscle
development, deserve no mer-
cy. The reason? These kinds of
drugs irreparably tarnish any
athletic contest because they
remove the essential element of
fairness by lending an unfair, as
well as unchallengeable, advan-
tage to the user. I always say
athletic contests are pure tests
of relative athletic skill.
Steroids and the like cause me
to wonder if they will ever be
that again...
CEC RREMET Ne

Time out...

...Our Prognosticator of Plen-
ty from that splotch on the con-
tinent of North America has re-
turned, lauding his forecasting
prowess. Yes, the Prince of
Jersey is back. The royal word
is thus: ‘‘Too early for NFL
predictions, you’ll have to wait
a week. I’ll remind you that my
baseball predictions (White
Sox, Brewers, Dodgers, and Ex-
pos) are (for the most part)
bearing out — and my rookie
phenom pick, Ron Kittle, has 32
homers...’”’ Ever since he pick-
ed the Derby winner, we
haven’t been able to calm him
down...

..Turning to the Colonnade
and W&L’s fall lineup, I see
some pretty favorable seasons.
Water polo under head man
Page Remillard is stacked once
again and should be able to
make up last year’s “nine
seconds” with time to spare.
Another conference title is
there for the asking for Coach
Dick Miller’s strong harriers.
And if soccer boss Rolf Piranian

Grades

(continued from page 1)

about how it would be im-
plemented.

The newly-adopted plus/
minus system was suggested
last year because, he said, ‘If
the faculty wanted a proposal,
this was the best and most ap-
propriate one.”’

According to Dean Watt, the
principal argument for moving
to plus/minus was that it offers
13 categories for grades instead
of just five.

‘Many faculty members
were concerned that there were
more levels of accomplishment
than available grades,’’ he said.
“They wanted to be able to be
more precise.

“The B and C categories
especially were thought to be
too broad, but they were willing
to expand the greater distinc-
tion to A and D as well.”’

Dean John concurred: ‘The
belief was that letter grades are
too gross measures of achieve-
ment. Grading is such a subjec-

tive thing anyway.”
Under the new system, a
“plus” and ‘‘minus’’ differen-

tiation is available for each let-
ter grade except F. The
numerical equivalent on a 4.00
scale is found by simply adding
.33 to or subtracting .33 from the
figure for the straight letter
grade.

One of the most controversial
aspects of the new system is
that it makes an A-plus, or 4.33,
grade available, where 4.00 was
previously the highest possible
grade.

Dean Watt says this was done
for reasons of symmetry: “If
you have an A-minus, you must
have an A-plus.”’

Also, the Committee on

Courses and Degrees proposal
to the faculty stated that an A-
plus, or 4.33, grading system is
recognized by the Law School
Data Assembly Service
(LSDAS), meaning that some
students could be at a com-
parative disadvantage under
the straight letter scheme.

It is this part of the new
grading procedure that causes
Bennett L. Ross (’83), president
of the student body last year, to
offer the assessment that ‘“‘my
personal feeling is that plus/
minus will slightly hurt grades
overall.

“I don’t personally know
many students who get
A-plus’. Most of your A’s are go-
ing to be A-minuses.”’

Col. Harold Head, University
Registrar, said that while last
year there were three gradu-
ating seniors with 4.00 averages
he doubts there will be any 4.33
final averages.

Head says that from his point
of view, implementation of the
system shouldn’t present any
complications. He foresees only
one potential difficulty, the en-
try of grades into the computer
by the Registrar’s office.

“Any time you have a
mechanical operation and you
add one more step — the
pushing of the plus mark or
minus mark key — you have
another chance to make a
human error, but I don’t see
that that should be a problem.”’

There appears to be no con-
sensus as to the significance
plus/minus will have in overall
averages, but a number of pro-
fessors agree with Dean John,
who said, ‘‘Most of the studies
I've seen show that overall

McDonald to
help hoops

Timothy R. McDonald, a
native of Bristol, Pa., and a 1979
graduate of West Chester
University, will join the
Washington and Lee University
athletic staff Sept. 1 as an assis-
tant basketball coach.

McDonald, 26, comes to the
Generals’ program following
four years as a Pennsylvania
high school coach and teacher.
During the 1979-80 school year

 

he was women’s basketball
coach and physical education
instructor at New Hope-
Solebury High in Hew Hope.
The past three years he has
been assistant men’s basketball
coach and physical education
teacher at his alma mater,
Neshaminy High School in
Langhorne.

“Tim appears to have the
tools to be a quality college
coach,” said W&L head coach
Verne Canfield. ‘We look for-
ward to his input and contribu-
tions, especially to our inside
game where we will need in-
tense instruction and develop-
ment to prepare for the coming
season.”’

McDonald holds his bache-
lor’s degree in health and
physical education from West
Chester, where he played two
years of basketball and served
in the student government.

 

 

 

there isn’t much change.”

There is some disagreement
about the validity of determin-
ing the effect statistically by
looking at overall averages.
Some, like Col. Head, say that
because of other potential in-
terfering factors, it won’t be
possible to state the exact effect
of the plus/minus grading.

any large change in the univer-
sity’s overall grade point
average can be directly at-
tributed to plus/minus.

“The statistics on the
students who are coming and

those who are leaving are

basically the same,’ he said
Ring-tum Phi calculations us-

ing data supplied by the Regis-

‘It may lead to a slight grade inflation

deviation of the mean. In this in-
stance, that would be a fluctua-
tion of .04 in either direction.
There is, however, only one
chance in 20 that the GPA would
vary by as much as two stand-

ard deviations, or .08. That is,
such a large change would oc-
cur randomly only one year out

or a slight grade

deflation, but you'll never really know. All that you'd

be able to do is take a guess.’

“Tt may lead to a slight grade
inflation or a slight grade defla-
tion,” he said, ‘‘but you’ll never
really know. All that you’d be
able to do is take a guess.”’

Dean John also doubts that it
will be possible to state the ef-
fect with any degree of preci-
sion, but says that the change in
the average should give you ‘‘a
rough idea.”

Dean Watt, however, said
that since ‘‘the student body is
always more or less the same,”’

trar show that over the last ten
years, the university GPA has
had a standard deviation (a
statistical measure of varia-
tion) of .04 from a mean, or
average, of 2.6807.

William Buchanan, head of
the W&L politics department
and author of “Understanding
Political Variables,” explains
that statistical theory tells us
that there are two chances in
three that the GPA next year
will fall within one standard

of twenty. Buchanan says that
the odds of the figure varying
by three standard deviations, or
.12, are roughly one in 100.

“If the average varies by
more than one standard devia-
tion, then we’ll know this seems
to be having an effect. You will
be able to say, ‘This is so
unusual that it must be due to
plus/minus grading...

“That would be almost ab-
solutely certain.”

EC fires Matrazzo

Mock Con tri-chairman out

By RICK SWAGLER
Chief Editor

Monday night the Executive
Committee rescinded the ap-
pointment of Steve Matrazzo,
the Mock Convention tri-
chairman in charge of political
research.

Student body President Bob
Jenevein said, ‘‘The EC felt that
in his position he would not
allow the convention to be as
good as it could be.”’

Jenevein said that Matrazzo
didn’t offer a resignation, forc-
ing the EC to rescind the ap-
pointment.

Matrazzo said that he thought
the EC handled the situation ‘“‘in
a relatively responsible man-
ner.”

EC secretary Len Howard
said, ‘“‘We wanted it to be as
relaxed an atmosphere as possi-
ble.”’

According to Matrazzo, each
tri-chairman made a statement
in Monday night’s closed EC
meeting and the committee
then questioned the three. The
committee deliberated and then
passed rescission on a voice
vote.

Matrazzo’s appointment, as
well as the appointments of the
two other tri-chairmen, Steve
Lewis and Peter Muller, were
made at the beginning of last
year.

On the following morning,
~ Jenevein received the resigna-
tions of Howard, the Lower
South Regional Coordinator and
John Haywood, Facilities
Chairman,

“I do not want my resignation

from the Mock Convention —

steering committee to appear
as if I had decided beforehand
that if I disagreed with the EC
as a whole I would resign,”’
Howard said. “I had some
doubts whether I could work
with the (Mock Convention)
committee,’’ he said.

Jenevein said he would be

surprised if he received any
more resignations. Lee
Feldman, the Mock Conven-
tion’s administrator, agreed.

According to Lewis, the
resignations have caused the
committee to alter its structure.
The Southern region, which had
been split into Upper and Lower
divisions, may be joined as a
result.

Regarding Matrazzo’s_ re-

sponsibilities, Lewis said, ‘‘We
have already spoken to Jack
Dent (Upper South Regional
Coordinator) about assuming
some of the responsibilities of
the political tri-chairman. We
assume that he will take on
these responsibilities.’’
Matrazzo said that the com-
mittee’s problems began with
the ‘“‘dynamics of having three

Rush dry, smooth

By PETER WRIGHT
Staff Reporter

Fraternity Rush at
Washington and Lee is in its
third week, and coordinator of
Fraternity Affairs, Dean Dan
Murphy said, ‘‘So far, rush has
gone pretty smoothly from the
perspective of the IFC (Inter-
fraternity Council).”

A major change in the struc-
ture of the 1983 fraternity Rush

compared to last year is that
the Rush Date parties are dry,
meaning that beer and other
alcoholic beverages are not per-
mitted. Previously, only the
Open House parties were dry.

The decision to hold dry Rush
dates was that of the IFC
Judicial Board, but the new rule
was a result of the Virginia
legislature raising the legal
drinking age to 19.

IFC Rush chairman Drew
Clark said if the IFC Judicial
Board had not passed the new
Rush provision, University of-
ficials would have eventually
passed it themselves.

“We just beat them to the
gun,”’ Clark said.

The monitoring of the dry
Rush parties is a system of
“self-regulation,” according to
Clark. He explained that two
representatives selected from
each fraternity were responsi-
ble for inspecting the activities
of other fraternities and making
sure they were abiding by all
IFC Rush principles.

Over 320 students par-
ticipated in Rush this year at
W&L, and they seemed more
aware and better prepared than
in previous years, Dean Mur-
phy said.

“They (the freshmen) seem
to be asking more questions and
are more leery of fraternities,”
Murphy commented.

Homecoming bows to Fall Weekend

While the 1983 Homecoming
weekend at Washington and Lee
will feature the W&L vs. Centre
game Saturday afternoon as
well as several traditional
alumni events, the weekend will
be void of the various social ac-
tivities by which it has been
marked in previous years.

Due to the early date of the
homecoming game and the lin-
gering Rush process, the Stu-
dent Activities Board has plan-

ned a Fall Weekend Oct. 28-31 to
feature a concert and other
events instead of attempting to
schedule traditional homecom-
ing activities this weekend, ac-
cording to SAB Treasurer John
Haywood.

Haywood said that the SAB is
sponsoring one band, The
Phonecops, in the Cockpit
Saturday night.

Homecoming activities for
returning alumni will include a
series of recreational events, in-

cluding a run on Lexington’s
Chessie Trail. The alumni will
be guests at a buffet luncheon
prior to the football game and at
a post-game reception.

Washington and Lee’s game
with Centre will be at 1:30 p.m.
on Wilson Field. The Homecom-
ing queen will be crowned at
halftime of the football game.

In addition, the Generals’
cross-country team will run
against Washington College and
Mary Washington College at 11

a.m. Saturday.

Other events scheduled for
Homecoming weekend include
the annual John Randolph
Tucker Lecture featuring
Eugene D. Genovese, author of

“Roll, Jordan, Roll,’ at 4:15
p.m. on Friday in the Moot
Courtroom of Lewis Hall, meet-
ings of both the law and under-
graduate alumni boards, and an
Alumni-Varsity lacrosse match
at 1p.m. on Sunday.

Review and Outlook

A lack of courtesy

We do not question the reasons behind the removal
of Steve Matrazzo as the Mock Convention tri-
chairman in charge of political research. By all ac-
counts the Executive Committee acted responsibly.

While the Student Body Constitution neither bars
the Phi nor allows it to attend hearings such as this or
others concerning subcommittee personnel, the Phi
stayed out of the meeting. We felt that our presence
might prevent the Committee and the tri-chairmen
from speaking freely.

We do, however, question the circumstances sur-
rounding the rescission of Matrazzo’s appointment.

Matrazzo says he was never overtly confronted by
the other tri-chairmen concerning his performance
until six days before his appointment was rescinded.
At that meeting with his colleagues, he was asked to
resign.

Matrazzo was never reprimanded, given a ‘“‘trial
period” or put on ‘‘probation.”’

Matrazzo was never even officially notified by the
Committee that his appointment was being reviewed.
He was never officially asked to appear before the
Committee to defend himself.

The first official word Matrazzo heard of the Com-
mittee’s decision was in the minutes of the meeting
rather than through the courtesy of a telephone call or
a visit.

Student Body President Bob Jenevein explained
that ‘‘pressures of time’’ caused these problems, say-
ing the circumstances were ‘“‘unfortunate.”’

When the pressures of time become so great as to
preclude common courtesy and protocol, the reasons
behind these sudden “‘pressures” should be examin-
ed.

Just as Matrazzo says we can learn from the pro-
blems associated with having three chairmen, so can
we learn from the unprofessional way in which the
Committee handled the details of their decision.

Are W&L
students
victims of
police?

To the Editors:

By now nearly everyone in
the W&L community is aware of
the violence that has taken
place within the past week. A
freshman girl was raped on the
second floor of a fraternity
house by a local black male,
and two W&L students were
assaulted and badly beaten by a
gang of black males. It isn’t the
first time that innocent students
have been assaulted for no ap-
parent reason. It seems that
every year there are half a
dozen or more separate in-
cidents where students are bad-
ly assaulted and hospitalized
while on their way home from a
late-night party.

The problem seems simple
enough and has existed for
generations: resentful townies
love to gang up on “rich white
boys” and beat the hell out of
them just for the fun of it
(Saturday night entertain-
ment). They obviously know
they can get away with it and
will continue to do so as long as
they remain unchecked. The
question of how to solve this
problem would seem simple
enough: simply let the police
department and the State
Troopers handle it, but this is
not the case. The police depart-
ment and the State Troopers
are, quite simply, incompetent.
There are a few exceptions
within the departments but they
are overshadowed by the ma-
jority of ‘law enforcement”’ of-
ficials.

 

 

 

 

 

 

I will admit that the police do
a wonderful job of telling frater-
nities they are being too noisy
and trying to bust a few stu-
dents who might (God forbid)
try to drink a beer at age 18, as
well as towing visiting girls’
cars away. But while the ‘‘good
ol’ boys’ are giving the
students as much of a hassle as
possible, (the ‘‘rich white boy”’
syndrome) the local youths are

raping young girls and beating
up students as well as stealing

Put Phi-EC battle

To the Editors:

Under the banner headline
“Paper starting on shaky
ground’”’ Scott Mason’s column
last week criticized The Phi for
not covering EC meetings last
spring and chided those who
defended the Phi’s right to this
action.

“The Ring-tum Phi had a du-
ty to cover every Executive
Committee (meeting) whether
the EC ‘looks over its shoulder’
(quoting Rick Swagler) or not.’’
wrote Mason, who should have
added that he was serving on
the EC last year.

And I should reveal that I
watched the EC criticize editor
Bill Roberts with the eyes of a
former editor; indeed, I

covered the EC 18 weeks my- —

self. I saw good government,
but I also witnessed hours of
pointless jabber, watched mem-
bers swap insults, learned of a
student body officer distribu-
ting anonymous posters to at-
tack a member during his re-
‘election campaign, and have
earned an EC president’s wrath

quite unintentionally because I
didn’t cover what he wanted
covered.

The service of the EC to the
school far outweighs any of this,
but my point is that the spine of
this issue of coverage is not The
Phi’s duty, but the EC’s egos.

Not that last year’s editor had
a small ego. Called in the Com-
mittee for a stern lecture on his
responsibilities, he sank to the
occasion, saying, “You guys
are a bunch of self-serving
douche-bags.”’ But then, Bill
Roberts had not come to tell the
EC how to do its job, but to be
told how to do his.

Describing the meeting,
Mason wrote, ‘‘Insults flew and
at least one member of the EC
voted to reprimand Roberts.”
This suggests that the EC has
some authority to reprimand an
editor, the way Congress might
censure a member, and such
power the EC does not have.
The above phrase also obscures
the fact that eight or nine
members of the EC did not vote
to reprimand Roberts.

everything they can get their
hands on.

The police are unsympathetic
to students and are probably
scared stiff of the young locals
who roam the streets at night.
After the two W&L students
were taken to the hospital and
one of their roommates, Jim
Noble ’85, was trying to get help
from the State Troopers, he was
shocked at the laughter and
gaiety that the ‘‘good ol’ boys”

aside

My purpose is not to impugn
Scott Mason’s undoubtable ex-
cellence and humility as a
writer and student leader, but
to remind the EC and The Phi
how pathetic their record of
mutual animosity would seem
to the students if revealed.

Doubtless The Phi will cover
the EC this year, and doubtless
the EC will feel itself misrepre-
sented at some point. That’s
when the EC can get its views
across to the students in the
most productive way — by tak-
ing advantage of the fact that
The Phi hardly ever has enough
copy and almost always runs
columns and letters to the
editors.

Right or wrong, Bill Roberts’
paper is gone now and The Phi
is not on “‘shaky ground.” But
let its new editors pledge them-
selves to cooperation instead of
confrontation, and let the EC
do likewise, both remembering
that in the eyes of the students
their titanic struggles seem
sometimes just so much midget

wrestling. ;

WW&L and VMI fumble their calendars

By SCOTT MASON

If you haven’t already seen the school calendar, you
may want to soon. In case you didn’t know, Homecom-
ing is two days away and if you were planning to invite
a young woman for the weekend, you’d better move
fast.

Unfortunately for some W&L administration mem-
bers, finding a date for the weekend is the least of their
worries. For months they’ve been knocking their heads
together to come up with a school calendar that will
please everybody, a calendar that doesn’t spring
Homecoming Weekend on you a week and a half after
classes start.

For those who have studied this year’s calendar, an

early Homecoming Weekend that barely gives you -

time to blink isn’t the only event to bitch about. Parents
Weekend falls on Nov. 12, less than a week before
Thanksgiving Vacation. That could discourage some
parents from attending since most will see their sons a
few days later anyway.

It would seem that the ideal time for Homecoming
would be the beginning of October and for Parents
Weekend the end of October. So what’s the problem?

The problem, if you can believe it, has largely to do
with football. Traditionally, one of the big attractions
of Homecoming and Parents weekend is the Saturday
afternoon football game. The problem isn’t that W&L
doesn’t have any home football games; rather, VMI’s
home games fall on the same date as W&L’s.

Home football games at VMI attract huge crowds
and, in turn, bring big business to Lexington mer-
chants. Hotel rooms, just to house the opposing team,
are quickly filled, and restaurants boom.

If W&L were to schedule Homecoming or Parents
Weekend on the same date as a VMI home football
game, Lexington merchants would be swamped. The

Professor comments on Soviets

nearest place to grab dinner or stay for the night would
be Buena Vista or Natural Bridge, several miles down
the road.

If, however, W&L’s Homecoming and Parents Week-
end and VMI’s home football games were held on
separate occasions, merchants would then be able to
accomodate the crowds. They’d also bring in more
money, because they wouldn’t be forced to turn away
customers.

It would seem the solution to the problem would be
for W&L and VMI to sit down and arrange their
schedules so that they don’t conflict.

There is some contact between the two schools, ac-
cording to Carter McNeese, one of the ‘“‘poor souls’’ in
charge of scheduling university events. However, be

 

Readers’ Advocate

 

that as it may, football schedules are apt to change and
have a knack for doing so after a Homecoming or Par-
ents Weekend has been set.

That’s what happened this year, according to
McNeese. W&L wanted to have its Parents weekend on
Nov. 5, but didn’t have a home football game. VMI was
scheduled to play at home on the fifth anyway so that
would have made it doubly impossible to have Parents
Weekend then. Every weekend in October was filled so
that the only day open was Nov. 12. W&L had a home
game on the 12th, and VMI was away. McNeese and
others reluctantly set the date of Parents Weekend for
the 12th knowing that Thanksgiving Vacation was just
a week later.

“‘There was nothing we could do about it,’” McNeese

said. ‘‘We realize that Nov. 12 is a rotten date for it.
We’ve gotten complaints from parents, faculty, and
students, and we knew they were going to come.”’

But when it rains, it pours, and what was a bad situa-
tion quickly got worse. Sometime during the summer,
after Parents Weekend was already set, VMI changed
its football schedule. Instead of playing at home on the
fifth and away on the 12th as had originally been sche-
duled, the Keydets now play away on the fifth and
home on the 12th. Consequently, W&L has run headlong
into a situation it had been desperately trying all along
to avoid. Parents Weekend this year falls on the same
day as a VMI home game, Nov. 12. So much for the
Lexington merchants.

What’s more, W&L had also altered its schedule. The
Generals were playing away on the fifth, but now play
at home. That leaves the fifth entirely open, which was
the date the administration had wanted to have Par-
ents Weekend in the first place.

Scheduling conflicts have occurred in the past. In
1979 Parents Weekend was as it is this year, a week
away from Thanksgiving Vacation. Nevertheless, a
large number of parents still attended the event, ac-
cording to Frank Parsons, assistant to the president.
Parsons doesn’t expect drastic decline in parent at-
tendance this year either.

Already, W&L is expecting similar scheduling con-
flicts next year as the ’84-85 calendar begins to take
shape. Meanwhile, university faculty are as far away
from a solution to the ‘‘Great Calendar Quandary” as
they ever nave been.

One administration member suggested dropping
football. That, he explained, was the only way out of
the mess, and indeed it looks like he may be right. But
for now, the football Generals continue to play ball,
while the W&L administration continues to fumble the
schedule.

from the Geneva arms talks.

“Let’s leave Geneva,” Mc-
Caughrin says. “It’s the only
ace up our sleeve. The Soviets
consider the talks to be salient.
Their behavior at the talks has
not been all that laudible.”’

While McCaughrin admits
such a bold move embodies a
risk of nuclear war and a con-
tinuation of the frigid U.S.-
Soviet relations, he believes it is
the only move the United States
has to show its degree of
outrage.

Reagan’s not placing sanc-
tions on the Russians was a
smart move. ‘Sanctions have
the effect of slapping (the Rus-
sians) with a wet noodle. A
grain embargo won’t hurt the
Russian leadership. The Rus-
sians (people) see sacrifice as
an honor, versus something to
avoid. You fall into the trap of
hurtihg the people and not those
responsible for the affair,’’ Mc-

Caughrin said.

Lifting Aeroflot landing
rights will create an annual loss
of $2 million for the Russians,
peanuts in view of their
estimated $300 billion annual
outlay for defense. ‘‘The
response of our allies was disap-
pointing. Why only (lift landing
rights) for two weeks? Why not
two months?,”’ questioned Mc-
Caughrin ‘‘Now we see the Sovi-
ets have effectively created a
monopoly on travel in and out of
Moscow, and they’re over-
charging on those flights
anyway. That’s giving them the
hard currency they need.”’

McCaughrin sees withdraw-
ing from the arms talks as the
best alternative. ‘Do we really
have that much to lose by walk-
ing away from Geneva? The
arms talks don’t modify Soviet
behavior. SALT I and SALT II
seemed to have incurred a
number of Soviet infractions. If
the Geneva conference were to
result in a reduction in nuclear
arms, the agreement would not
be followed by the Soviets,’’ he
noted.

(McCaughrin noted that one
Soviet defector has hypothesiz-
ed that one reason KAL 007 was
shot down was that it was flying
over an area where missiles for-
bidden by SALT I and SALT II
are being illegally manufac-
tured.)

Though he does not agree

should leave the arms talks, McCaughrin says

with William F. Buckley, Jr.’s
assessment that Reagan will be
the 270th victim of the plane’s
mishap, McCaughrin believes
the public saw a mellowed
Ronald Reagan reacting to the
affair and offers several prob-
ing questions explaining the
change in character.

— ‘We are coming into an
election year. Is he moderating
his speech to attract voters?”’

— “Ronald Reagan was the
oldest President to enter office.
Does (the power of the Oval Of-
fice to moderate its occupant)
weaken with the age of the
President?”

— “Or was the moderate
rhetoric intended as an attempt
to curb reprisals by an outraged
public?”

While McCaughrin agrees
that Reagan’s Speech contained
the fiery rhetoric and outrage
customary to the conservative,
he notes that the constraint
placed upon Reagan by the
limitations of the Oval Office
weighed heavily in the
moderate response.

“I don’t know whom Reagan
is listening to,”’ he notes, ‘‘but
the adviser doesn’t realize the
power of the arms talks. That’s
where it hurts. If we just let (the
downing of the plane) go with-
out any more action, (the
world) will forget about it. That
is why it comes back to arms

“We're excusing their be-
havior, chalking it up to a sick-
ness, a military paranoia. No!
they’re dead serious about this.
It is not so much a paranoia but

control.”’

Interestingly, McCaughrin
points out that the end of
Reagan’s speech has given the
Democratic presidential hope-
fuls fodder for their speeches.
After noting the amazing lack of
silence from the Democratic
side after the mishap, Mc-
Caughrin said Reagan’s final
plea for greater defense spen-
ding and production of the MX
missile was misguided. “If
Reagan does fall victim to the
Democrats, it will be due to

domestic issues,’ predicted
McCaughrin.
“If nothing else, Ronald

Reagan has learned — and he
made it very clear in his
message — that the point in a
situation like KAL 007 is not
revenge. The point is to modify
Soviet behavior. They will shoot
down 10 more planes should
they fly in,”’ he said.

a well-grounded fear. They
have a flat terrain. Poland has
invaded Russia from the West.
The Mongols in the East. Now
there’s China to worry about.
We are fortunate in having
friendly neighbors to the north
and south and oceans as bar-
riers,” he continued. ‘Their
behavior is evil. The question is
whether their motivation is
evil.”

| Burglary,

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

In the wake of a rape and a
burglary at Washington and
Lee fraternity houses following
Rush parties last week, Lex-
ington Police Chief Lawrence
Q. Sutton said that the universi-
ty social atmosphere is ‘‘con-
ducive”’ to problems, and steps
must be taken to reduce the
likelihood of future alterca-
tions.

The rape victim was a
freshman from Randolph-
Macon Woman’s College, and
Chief Sutton said there is no in-
dication that her assailant was
a W&L student.

Law enforcement records
show that the crime occurred
about 3:45 a.m. last Thursday
at the Pi Kappa Alpha (Pika)
house at 106 North Main Street.

The nearby Phi Delta Theta
house was burglarized early the

same morning, and Sutton said

investigators ‘do feel there
may be some connection be-
tween the two. The inquiries are
being pursued jointly.”

Police are seeking a suspect
described as ‘‘a black male with
medium-brown skin, in his
twenties, 5 feet 8 inches to 5 feet
9 and a half inches tall,

At the time of the crime, he is
said to have been wearing a
light-colored shirt and blue

“We do have a suspect in
mind,” the chief said. The
suspect, a Lexington resident,
was taken to the police station
last week, interviewed, and
then released.

“We will continue the in-
vestigation until we have
enough evidence to establish
probable cause to arrest the
subject,” Sutton said.

only as “‘scientific investigative

Sutton said that “‘several
students who are believed to
have seen the subject have been .
reviewing photographs of
known criminals in Lexington”’
in an attempt to make a positive
identification.

He said that this technique
would continue to be used
throughout the course of the in-
vestigation.

Using the police report taken
about 7:30 a.m. Thursday, Chief
Sutton related the sequence of
events:

“The subject was sleeping by
herself in a bedroom on the se-
cond floor of the Pi Kappa
Alpha house. She was awakened
by an unknown black male
choking her.

‘“‘A member of the fraternity
in an adjoining room was
awakened by her struggling and
making noises. He then ejected
the subject from the house.

“The girl was treated at
Stonewall Jackson Hospital for
bruises and soreness of the
throat. She had been choked,
and she had lacerations on the
back of her head.

“The usual medical tests in
cases of this nature were per-
formed.”’

ROTC cadets finish
high at Ft. Bragg

By DAVID W. JOHNSTON
Staff Reporter

A team of 26 Reserve Of-
ficers’ Training Corps cadets
from Washington and Lee took
top state honors at the 1983
ROTC First Region Advanced
Camp, held at Fort Bragg, N.C.,
during June and July.

During the six-week pro-
gram, the cadets competed with
teams from 111 other schools
and finished 13th overall, the
highest of the 11 Virginia col-
leges participating.

During the program the
cadets who had just finished
their junior year, received
training in a variety of fields,
including first aid, communica-
tions, orienteering, weaponry
and small-unit tactics. The em-
phasis, however, was on leader-
ship skills and the cadets’ abili-
ty to respond to field situations.

The exerciscs were the cul-
mination of years of practice
and training, said Capt. Bayard
T. Keller, one of the instructors
who helped the cadets prepare
for the camp. During their
training with the W&L ROTC
detatchment, Keller said, the
cadets were exposed to almost
everything the camp would test.

17 S. Main St.

Leadership skills, or job per-
formance, was the single most
important element tested. For
as part of this, the cadets were
required to command a unit
ranging from about a dozen to
over a hundred troops. The
leader had to take the cadets
through their daily routine and
any drills that might be re-
quired. This is vital Keller said,
because, should a cadet decide
to enter active service after
graduation, he will enter as a
second lieutenant.

Another major part of the ex-
ercise was a field experience
designed to test the cadets’
reaction to situations that might
be encountered on the bat-
tlefield. These could range from
wounded civilians to the death
of a commanding officer.

Land navigation and military
skills tests both counted as 20
percent of the cadets’ final
grade. During the land naviga-
tion test, cadets were required
to use a map and compass to
manuever in the dark, and the
military skills section tested
basic field tasks like gun
maintenance and radio opera-
tion. A physical fitness test also
accounted for 20 percent. A
riflery test accounted for 2 per-

cent of the final score.

Keller attributes the cadets’
success to their overall superi-
ority, citing standardized tests
and extracurricular activities
as indicators. Many of the tests
required advanced training and
study, in addition to a general
academic, knowledge of field
skills. Keller said the W&L
students are well prepared for

The Ring-tum Phi, September 22, 1983, Page 5

these trials.

The cadets trained for the
Fort Bragg exercise by taking
military science courses and
participating in regular ROTC
programs here, often held on
weekends. One of the most im-
portant parts of the prepara-
tion, Keller said, was a week-
end-long camp, held at Fort
Pickett in May, that simulated

many of the Fort Bragg exer-
cises.

In addition to W&L, top
schools included Johns Hop-
kins, MIT and Cornell, all of
which scored in the top dozen,
just above W&L.

The Virginia Military In-
stitute’s Keydets finished 80th.

~ Mock Con closes in on budget goal

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

Although the 1984 Wash-
ington and Lee Mock Con-
vention is still nine months
away, the steering committee
and staff is closing in on raising
the approximately $100,000
budget for the quadrennial
spectacular.

At first glance, that figure
seems large, but convention of-
ficals estimate the Mock Con-
vention only will cost a max-
imum of $8 per Washington and
Lee student.

Mock Convention officals
presented a budget request of
$13,632 to the Executive Com-
mittee Monday night, according
to Michael Shelton, Convention

treasurer.

Shelton said the remainder of
the Mock Convention’s funds
will be raised through a variety
of methods, the biggest of which
is a Hatton Sumners’ Founda-
tion grant that will total $30,000
by February.

One arm ot the steering com-
mittee, the finance committee,
is responsible for raising about
$3,000 from major contributors,
such as corporations.

The individual state delega-
tions, however, serve as the big-
gest fund-raisers.

A total of $25,000 will be rais-
ed by the states, with approx-
imately $5,000 going to the
steering committee under a
complicated taxing formula,
Shelton explained.

 

>, .%, .%, .% .%, 4%

As of Sept. 15, Guam, under
chairman Charlie Alcorn had
raised the most money, $625,
followed by Texas with $450.

The states use their portion of
the money to build a float for
the Mock Convention parade
through downtown Lexington
and to conduct research in
order to predict accurately
which Democratic candidate
their state will support in the
actual convention.

Mock Convention officials ad-
mit they’re slightly worried,
though, because only eight
states have responded with any
contributions, and the total con-
tributions are just over $1,500.

‘‘We’re concerned, needless
to say,”’ Shelton said. ‘“‘But we
also don’t want anybody to

panic because we will be receiv-
ing a sizeable chunk of student
activities funds.

“T’m not sure that we have a
problem in that most of the
state chairmen are beginning to
set up their organizations and
familiarize themselves with
their states. We expect to see
some improvement in the over-
all picture.”’

Shelton indicated, that the
convention is probably about
where it was four years ago at
this time in terms of fund rais-
ing. About 70 percent of the con-
vention funds either have been
raised already or will come
from the student body tax and
the Sumners’ Foundation.

‘‘We’ve raised almost a fifth
of what we intend to spend,”’
Shelton said.

Fund raising activities thus
far have included sending let-
ters to previous donors and
former steering committee
members and state chairmen.

As money is contributed to
the Mock Convention, it is divid-
ed among the various commit-
tees according to the percen-
tage each receives of the
overall budget, Shelton expiain-
ed.

Those percentages range

from 18.1 percent for the
speakers and protocol commit-
tee and 12.1 percent for the
facilities committee to one per-
cent for each of the four
regional committees.

Senior Rob Massie serves as
comptroller and assistant
treasurer for the convention. In
that position, Massie ensures
that all accounting procedures
are correct.

Although the Mock Conven-
tion’s request for funds from the
EC is one of the larger organiza-
tional requests this year, the
convention receives less money
per student per year than many
other student organizations.

“It’s a well-endowed instu-
tion,’’ Shelton said. ‘‘And we
will make good use of our
money and none will go to
waste. Everything is budgeted
on a computer from now until
we pay our last bill.”’

The Mock Convention boasts
a success record of 12 correct
predictions in 17 attempts, and
the convention’s funding only
helps maintain those achieve-
ments.

‘‘After all,”’ said Shelton, ‘“‘if
it takes money to make it a suc-
cess, then it is a hollow func-
tion.”’

Hospital officials called
police to report a _ simple
assault, and Chief Sutton learn-

after he had arrived to take the
report.

The girl returned to Lynch-

burg later that morning.

The intruder was “thrown
down the stairs and left’’ out-
side by a Pika resident, Sutton
said. ‘‘It’s unfortunate that this
happened with students and not
an officer.

partying, so his thinking was
not up to par. He observed the
intruder in a compromising
position. He didn’t like what he
saw, but he didn’t know a rape
was taking place. I feel satisfied
with that.”’

The chief said that in a situa-
tion like this, the suspect should
‘“absolutely’’ be detained ‘“‘if
there are enough people to do it.
It may be the only chance we
have’’ to positively identify the
perpetrator of the crime.

“For the sake of decency and
respect for the girl,’’ the chief
asked that the name not be us-
ed. ‘‘I’m very protective of my
victims,”’ he said.

“‘She’s a hell of a decent kid,”’
Sutton said. ‘‘She came to a par-
ty to have a good time and this
happened to her.

“She’s not like some girls
who’ve been around for years
and make all the parties and
sleep around at all the houses.
She’s not one of those.

“She’s a very decent kid who
got caught in a very tragic
situation.”’

(continued from page 6)

In response to a query about
the victim’s condition, Ingrid
Montecino, Dean of Students at
Randolph-Macon and acting
Dean of the College, said terse-
ly, ‘‘Physically, she’s all right
under the circumstances.”

Montecino put a notice on the
front page of last Friday’s
“Sundial,’’ the student news-
paper which said that ‘“‘a R-M
student was assaulted at a W&L
fraternity.”

“Because the assailant has
not been apprehended,”’ Monte-
cino recommended in the paper
“that students do not visit the
W&L campus for several days
as a safety precaution.”

Lewis G. John, the W&L Dean
of Students, later telephoned
Dean Montecino ‘‘primarily to
ask about the girl’s condition. I
also let her know the case was
being investigated, and told her
that steps were being taken to
increase security at the frater-
nities.”

Dean John, who said he could

‘not recall another crime ‘“‘of

this nature” in his years with
the university, said that the
school was doing what it could
to cooperate with the  in-
vestigaiton.

At least one other university
official, who asked not to be
identified, said that he had pro-
vided substantive assistance to
police working on the case.

The robbery at Phi Delta
Theta is believed to have oc-
curred between 1 a.m. and 4
a.m. Thursday morning.

‘“‘We do feel it may be related
to the rape...because of the
vague description we have at
this time of the perpetrator of
both crimes supplied by
students who were eyewit-
nesses,’’ Chief Sutton said.

According to police records,
$40 in cash; $22 in undeposited
checks; eight identification,
bank, and credit cards; and a
wallet valued at $50 were stolen
from the bedrooms of five in-
dividuals on the second and
third floors of the Phi Delt
house.

Early the same morning, a
resident of the Sigma Nu house,
across Henry Street from Phi
Delt, was robbed of a cardigan
wallet, $24 in cash and five
cards.

John-Paul Bouffard, another
member of Sigma Nu, was
awakened at 2:30 that morning
“by my wallet being thrown
with a thud at the foot of my
bed.

“Someone was going through |
my drawers and wallet. I told’
him to put the stuff back, and he |
emptied his pockets. I then
chased him down the fire|
escape.”

Bouffard said he did not at-
tempt to apprehend the intruder |
“because I didn’t know if he had
a knife or anything. I had just}
woken up, so I was basically in!
a fog. My first instinct was,
‘You better put that back,’ and
he did.”

Because of the similarity of
the occurrences at Sigma Nu

 
 
   
    
  
   
   
  
     
   
  

 

and Phi Delt, Bouffard believes
the same people were involved.

‘I’ve seen photos of the rape
suspect, and I don’t think it’s
the same person. But it sounds
like they were working togeth-
er. They were obviously just go-
ing from room to room at the
two houses,”’ Bouffard said.

In a series of interviews,
Chief Sutton kept returning to
the atmosphere in which frater-
nity parties are conducted as he
sought to prevent another oc-
currence like that of last Thurs-
day morning from taking place
again.

“The ‘open house’ type of at-
mosphere in which these par-
ties are conducted is conducive
to this sort of thing,’’ he said.
“This relaxed approach is beau-
tiful in a way, but it is an invita-
tion to those who would take ad-
vantage.”

“If you make it a private par-
ty, you ask anybody who’s not

invited to leave, and if they
don’t, then they’re trespassing,
and you can call us,” he con-
tinued.

“Fraternity houses are sup-
posed to be closed, open to
members and guests only.
You’re not supposed to invite
townspeople and I don’t think
they expect to be invited.

‘“‘When you leave it open, and
then party to the extent that
your alcoholic consumption
causes you to fail to take
reasonable care of your valua-
bles and safety, you’re inviting
problems. It doesn’t mean
anybody has the right to do it,
but it will happen.”

Chief Sutton said that ‘“‘more
student interest was generated
in the burglaries because of the
rape across the street. We have
one or two reports of larcenies
every time there are parties.”

Sutton said he would value in-
formation from anyone who had

didn’t want the investigation
impeded.

The chief bristled. ‘I ap-
preciate any assistance from
anybody, but I will not tolerate
interference.

“‘T request that they help us to
help them.”’ He said this can be
done through ‘‘a few simple
methods,”’ including those that
Pika has instituted on his ad-
vice.

He also said that, surprisingly
often, students leave stereos
running even after the parties
are over, which he said is a
dangerous practice because it
makes the detection of in-
truders more difficult.

Sutton was unwilling to
discuss many details of the in-
vestigation, because ‘‘it is all of
evidentiary value and might
jeopardize the case before
trial.”

Sutton, who took command of
the Lexington police force on
May 9, said that it is fortunate
events of this significance have
not happened before.

“Statistically speaking, on a
national basis, it’s accepted
that for every rape that is re-
ported, ten go unreported,” he
said.

“I have no reason to believe
Lexington is any exception,
because of the atmosphere
here.”’ He emphasized, how-
ever, ‘“‘that doesn’t make Lex-
ington any worse than any other
city. I think Lexington is
dynamite.”’

Sutton offered a number of
solutions to the security issues
which have been raised in the
last week. ‘‘The students have
to protect themselves a little by
using a little discretion in the
protection of their property,”
he said.

Huntley says ‘no’

to congressional

By B. SCOTT TILLEY
Staff Reporter

Invoking the ‘Sherman
Oath’’ on his own behalf, former
Washington and Lee president
Robert E.R. Huntley has ruled
out the possibility that he may
be a candidate in next year’s
Sixth District House of Repre-
sentatives race, despite being
approached by at least one in-
fluential Republican.

‘Politics and running for of-
fice have not and do not interest
me,” said Huntley, who has
returned to teaching law at
W&L.

Rumors have been cir-
culating within and outside of
the Republican Party that
Huntley would be a good can-
didate to try to win back the

Congressional seat the
Republicans lost in 1982 for the
first time in 30 years.

“If the rumor has_ been
started about me running, I
wish you would stop it. It’s not
true,” Huntley said, adding that
he has no interest in running for
elected office in the future.

Robert W. Goodlat, chairman
of the Sixth District Republican
Party, confirmed that Huntley
“had definitely been approach-
ed by a prominent member of
the business community here in
Roanoke,”’ but that Huntley had
responded with a firm ‘‘no.”’

TaCe

 

Robert E.R. Huntley

“It was a_ well-conceived
idea,’’ Goodlat said. ‘‘Many felt
he would be an excellent can-
didate...1 personally don’t
believe it will be pursued,
though, at least by the party.”’

The Sherman Oath is based
on Gen. William Tecumseh
Sherman’s 1884 pledge, ‘‘I will
not accept if nominated, and
will not serve if elected.”

Other names that have been
mentioned as_ possible op-
ponents to incumbent Rep.
James Olin include State Sen.
Ray Garland, former Attorney
General J. Marshall Coleman,
Del. Steve Agee and former
Del. Ray Robrecht.

Genovese

to lecture
tomorrow

Eugene D. Genovese, pro-
fessor of history at the Universi-
ty of Rochester, will deliver The
John Randolph Tucker Lecture
for 1983 at Washington and Lee
University’s School of Law
tomorrow.

The title of Genovese’s lec-
ture is ‘‘The Law and Slave
Society in the Thought of
Antebellum Southern Political
Economists.’’ It will be
presented at 4:15 p.m. in the
Moot Courtroom of Lewis Hall.
The lecture is open to the
public.

The Tucker Lectures were
established at Washington and
Lee in 1949 in honor and
memory of the distinguished
service of Mr. Tucker as dean
and professor of law from 1823
to 1897.

The first Tucker Lecture was
delivered by John W. Davis,
who served as Solicitor General
of the U.S. and Ambassador to
Great Britain. Subsequent lec-
tures in the series have been
given by distinguished lawyers,
judges and scholars, including
U.S. Supreme Court Justice
Lewis F . Powell.

 
 

 

Two W&L students
assaulted Sunday

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

Two Washington and Lee
University students were
assaulted by six black males
Sunday at about 2:15 a.m. as
they were walking west on
Massie Street, according to
Police Chief L.O. Sutton.

Senior Roger McDonough suf-
fered a broken nose and junior
Ed Buttarazzi received several
cuts and bruises during the
altercation, Buttarazzi said.

Buttarazzi said that he and
McDonough were walking home
from a party at Pi Kappa Phi
when they were approached by
six to eight black males who ap-
peared to be 25 to 30 years old.
Buttarazzi said they told the
men that they were not looking
for any trouble, but the men
started throwing punches
anyway.

“It was a totally unprovoked
attack,”” McDonough said.

After the assailants left the
scene, Buttarazzi and McDon-

ough walked the rest of the way
home. Senior Patrick Buttaraz-
zi, Ed’s brother, called the
police and a patrol car took the
two injured men to the hospital.

Soon afterwards, Patrick But-
tarazzi and junior Jim Noble
were driving to the hospital
when a group of men who fit the
description of the men who
assaulted McDonough and Ed
Buttarazzi blocked the path of
their car, Ed Buttarazzi said.
Pat Buttarazzi had to slow down
the car and manuever his way
through the men while some of
them were banging on the wind-
shield, Ed Buttarazzi said.

Noble and Pat Buttarazzi
reported the incident to the
police.

Ed Buttarazzi said that he
was disappointed that the police
did not immediately send out a
patrol car to try to find and
identify the members of the
group after his brother reported
the second incident.

“I don’t think the police
responded very well to it,” Ed
Buttarazzi said.

Thousands of Army ROTC graduates, from hundreds of

college campuses, have become leaders in our country’s

volunteer Army.

Some enrolled in ROTC for financial aid to complete col-
lege (over 60 individuals at Washington and Lee are on full
ROTC scholarships). Others for the management training
and experience offered by Army ROTC courses. Still others
for the positions of immediate leadership responsibility
following graduation, as officers in the active Army,

Reserves, and Army National Guard.

But most enrolled also to serve their country. Men from
the north, the east, the south, the west ... from small urban
areas. They've shown that you don’t have to be from Ten-
nessee to be a volunteer, or from Texas to stand tall for your

country.

Law students have a variety of backgrounds

Who is becoming a lawyer
these days?

Bankers ministers and
newspaper reporters. House-
wives and engineers and in-
surance adjusters.

Those, at least, are a few of
the careers in which first-year
law students were working
before they entered the Wash-
ington and Lee University
School of Law this fall.

Statistics compiled by the ad-
missions office indicate that a

majority of law students, at
Washington and Lee at least,
still enter directly from college.
Of the 123 students in the first-
year law class this fall, 54 per-
cent (67 students) received
their bachelor’s degree in 1983.
The statistics indicate a
continuing trend among
students to take at least one
year away from the classroom
before beginning graduate
studies. For instance, 14.7 per-
cent of the first-year W&L law

students graduated in 1982 and
took a year off before beginning
law school while another 10.5
percent took two years off.

The remaining 20.8 percent of
the first-year class graduated in
1980 or earlier.

‘“‘My impression is that the
trend nationwide is for law
students to be older and that
many continue to enter from
other careers,’ says Edward 0.
Henneman, assistant dean of
the W&L Law School. “If
anything our statistics in this
regard are less dramatic than
those from law schools in large
urban areas.”

Yet, the W&L law school has
its share of students who are
embarking on new careers or
perhaps getting a law degree to
supplement a current career.

Among those students who
received their bachelor’s
degrees in 1980 or earlier, the

following
represented:

careers were

— a bank officer;

—a former press secretary
and speechwriter for a state
political official ;

— a minister who already
holds a doctorate in religious
education;

— an industrial engineering
systems analyst for a major gas
company;

— two paralegals from New
York law firms;

— a government reporter for
an Iowa newspaper;

— an agricultural research-
er;

— a radio station news direc-
tor.

“We do have a good deal of
diversity in terms of the careers
from which these men and
women have come but also in
terms of the academic interests
pursued by those students who

graduated most recently,”
noted Henneman.

While political science was
the most popular undergradu-
ate major among the first-year
law students, virtually every
course of study is represented
from music to art to geography.

History was the second most
popular major followed by
English, economics, business
administration, philosophy, and
journalism.

And that does not even in-
clude some of the varied ex-
tracurricular interests of the
entering students, who included
among their numbers a former
Atlantic Coast Conference
basketball player, the ad-
ministrator of a day-care
center, the coach of a national
championship equestrian team,
and a _ national champion
weightlifter.

And that’s who’s going to law
school these days.

Lloyd vs. city hall

 

Public hearing slated tonight

By BOB BRYANT
Special to the Phi

Lloyd Smith, owner and
manager of Lloyd’s of Lex-
ington, may be forced to close
the game room section of his
restaurant unless he is granted
a conditional use permit by the
Lexington City Council tonight.
There will be a public hearing
on the matter tonight at 8
o’clock in City Hall, 300 East

permit for a game room at that
same location.” Mette then
notified Smith that he was in
violation of a 1976 zoning or-
dinance which prohibits the
operation of ‘Public billiard
parlors and pool rooms, bowling
alleys, dance halls and similar
forms of public amusement,”’
without a conditional use per-
mit from the city.

‘‘When I opened, I went to the
zoning administrator, Paul
Buskey, and he said that I could

If they take away half of my income I

The legality of the game-
room section of Lloyd’s was
questioned last spring while the
Lexington Planning Commis-
sion was discussing a possible
game room ordinance. Accor-
ding to Building and Zoning Ad-
ministrator Donald Mette, ‘‘In
looking through the old records,
I found out that approximately
two years ago someone had
been denied a conditional use

put games in my restaurant
because I sold food and didn’t
need a permit,” Smith said.
After Buskey resigned Smith
went to his replacement,
Leonard Reis, who also gave his
assurances that he could con-
tinue to operate without a condi-
tional use permit. When Mette,

tion of building and zoning ad-

ed in 1980, notified Smith ot the
situation, Smith applied to the
city for a conditional use per-
mit.

Smith’s case was referred by
City Council to the planning
commission, which held a
public hearing Aug. 18 at which
Washington and Lee professor
Albert Gordon among other
spokesmen testified on behalf of
Lloyd’s. The planning commis-
sion voted at the conclusion of
the hearing to recommend to
the City Council that Lloyd’s
should be allowed to continue to
operate, ‘‘as is until we are able
to draft an ordinance.”’ Accord-
ing to Mette, the planning com-
mission ‘‘didn’t feel that the or-
dinance was definite enough,”’
so the recommendation went to
City Council, which then
scheduled tonight’s public hear-
ing.

Tonight is the second public
hearing that Smith has had to
prepare for, including gather-
ing signatures for a petition, in
four weeks. Says Smith, “If

come, I may have to reconsider
whether I can stay in Lex-

Lewis) thought it was a do or
die situation,’’ he said. ‘‘The at-
tempts (to resolve it) were not

commensurate with the pro-
blem.’’: ~

Lewis and Matrazzo both said
that the decision was not a per-
sonal one.

“I bear them no personal
malice,’’ Matrazzo said.

Matrazzo also says he was
never informed officially of the
EC’s review of his appointment
and received no official notice

 

 

of the Executive Committee’s
decision until he saw a notice in
the EC minutes.

Howard, also the Executive
Committee secretary, said that
all three tri-chairmen will
receive letters from Jenevein
officially notifying them of the
rescission.

Lewis, Feldman and Matraz-
zo all agree that the tri-
chairmen arrangement was un-
workable.

“T don’t think any organiza-
tion can function with three
chairmen,” Feldman said.

The cause of the problems
seem to be a combination of the
tri-chairman format and a con-
flict of management styles.

“Ultimately there must be
one person at the top with the
final say,’ Matrazzo said.

Matrazzo said that the con-
flicting styles created a stress
at the upper level of the com-
mittee that filtered down into
the lower ranks. “Even now
that I’m gone, that stress re-
mains,’’ Matrazzo said.

Jenevein said, ‘‘The commit-
tee agrees the (tri-chairman)
format was tough to manage.
You have to have someone who
is ultimately in charge.”’

“If the Student Body (present
and future) is to gain anything
from this, it has to be discuss-
ed,’’ Matrazzo said referring to
the lessons he said could be
learned from the tri-chairman
format.

“‘Now that it’s happened, we
might as well learn some-
thing,” Matrazzo said.

The peripheral effects of the
shake-up on the Convention are
yet to be seen.

Haywood estimated that the
committee will be about two
months behind schedule, but
Lewis differs, saying that it
won’t alter the schedule at all.

Feldman said that the
changes will ‘‘probably hurt
morale at the beginning but in-
crease efficiency. I don’t think
it will have a devastating effect
on morale,”’ he said.

Matrazzo agrees, saying it
will only ‘“‘color things for a
short period of time.”’

Jenevein commented that
“for the Mock Convention to be
a success will require some
degree of resilience and renew-
ed motivation.”

“To lose one of the top
three...is potentially very
destructive,’’ he said.

Matrazzo did not seem bitter
although he admitted he is
disappointed.

‘My biggest concern is that
the convention go on,’’ he said.
“I do believe there are highly
qualified people out there who
can assume those positions
(vacated by resignations)’’ he
said.

“TI don’t want to burden the
convention by making an issue
of this,’’ Matrazzo said.

“There’s still a piece of my
heart in the convention,” he
said.

Lewis said that the commit-
tee has already taken steps
toward restructuring the con-
vention. But Howard observed,
“We're approaching the time
when we can’t keep making
these changes.”’

Polo lacks depth, looks to correct mistakes

The Ring-tum Phi, September 22, 1983, Page 13

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
water polo team finished fourth
in the W&L Fall Classic at the
Cy Twombly Pool last weekend.
The Generals (6-3) finished the
tournament witha record of 2-3.

W&L collected wins over the
University of Arkansas at Little
Rock and Johns Hopkins
University. The Generals lost
games to Navy, Bucknell and
Richmond. Navy won the tour-
nament with a 5-0 record.

Coach Page Remillard cited
Bobby Pearson and Tim Stan-
ford for outstanding play. Matt
Ravencraft led the scoring at-
tack for the Generals. Raven-
craft scored 15 goals during the
tournament.

Although the W&L B team
finished the tournament in last
place, Coach Remillard is very

. pleased with the play displayed

by the freshmen. ‘‘They played
beyond expectations. Our fu-
ture is bright if they continue to
improve at this rate,’’ he said.
Coach Remillard added, ‘‘The

freshmen possess the en-
thusiasm which is a _ prere-
quisite for continuing the
aquatic tradition at W&L.”’

Reflecting on the tournament,
Coach Remillard said, ‘‘We
knew that we had a weakness
going into the tournament but
we were not really sure how
well we could hide it.’’ Accord-
ing to Remillard, the W&L team
lacks depth. Coach Remillard
had to keep his starters in the
water for almost the entire
weekend. Players from other
teams could play hard knowing
that other players would be
substiuted for them regularly.
W&L’s players had to play
knowing that they would
receive very little rest.

Coach Remillard believes
that the physical and mental
fatigue of W&L players created
careless mistakes. ‘‘To show
our improvement, we must cut
down on our number of turn-
overs each week,” he said.
Remillard believes it is very
important that W&L steal more
balls than they give up in a
game. Remillard, however,

said, “All of our mistakes can
be corrected.”’

Coach Remillard hopes to
reduce the number of the
team’s turnovers by using a
new method of substitution. The
starting six players play the
first three minutes of the game
before being replaced by a se-
cond string of rested players
who will play the remainder of
the quarter. Remillard said,

“Everybody is going to get a lot
of playing time.”

Coach Remillard will test his
new method of substitution this
weekend when W&L particis
pates in the Northeast Varsity
Invitational. The tournament is
being played at Brown and will
include the top ten collegiate
water polo teams on the East
coast. In addition to W&L and
Brown, teams from M.1I.T.,

Harvard, Navy, Bucknell, Ar-
my, George Washington, Slip-
pery Rock and Richmond will
participate.

Concerning this weekend’s
competition, Coach Remillard
said, “If we win any game, I
will be ecstatic.’’ He concluded,
“If we do win a game, it will
probably be against M.I.T. I
think that they are in the same
situation as we are.”

A new lax era begins

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

After eleven seasons of filet
mignon lacrosse coaching, the
W&L community will be a dif-
ficult group to please now that
Jack Emmer is gone. Dennis
Daly, the new head lacrosse
man, fortunately has the at-
titude that will allow him to suc-
cessfully meet that challenge.

This past July 19, Emmer an-
nounced his resignation as the
Generals’ head coach to accept
a similar position at West Point.
The university named Daly as
his replacement in an an-
nouncement by athletic director
Bill McHenry on Aug. 5. Daly
began his W&L responsibilities,
which include an assistant pro-
fessorship as well, on Sept. 1.

Daly enters his new role with
great. expectations. ‘I’m confi-
dent of who 1 amas a coach, and
I know we’re going to put out a
very good effort,” said Daly.

Although he is still in the tran-
sition process, Daly is quite

pleased with his reception. ‘TI’

feel a lot of support, starting
with the players and continuing
throughout the faculty and the
college community,” reflected
Daly, who has been meeting
with players as well as begin-
ning fall lacrosse practice last
Tuesday.

In particular, the response of
the players has been very
favorable. ‘‘So far, the players
have given me all that I could
have hoped for,”’ said Daly.

Daly is a veteran college
coach of eight years and 24
seasons of experience in hockey
and football in addition to
lacrosse. Before coming to Lex-
ington, his lacrosse team at his
alma mater Amherst produced
that team’s best record in 12
seasons. Previous to Amherst,

Daly coached at Middlebury
where his teams earned three
NCAA Division III Tournament
bids ina row.

He plans no drastic changes,
but admits, ‘There will be a
transition period as they learn
my different terms,’’ Daly looks
to make minor defensive
changes and provide for a more
total team offensive plan.

The new boss has tremendous

friend from lacrosse camps in
the past, but there is no degree
of awe in Daly’s mind. Says Da-
ly, “I don’t have to build tradi-
tion here. I need to maintain it. I
feel confident we can do that,
and, perhaps improve over the
most recent seasons.”’

Daly advocates the Division

 

which competes in Division I, as
‘‘the best of both worlds.’’ As he
sees it, “As long as W&L can re-
main competitive and not
sacrifice our Division III
philosophy, I say, ‘Why not
(compete in Division I)?’.”’
Admitting that ‘competitive’
is a term that would have to
continually be evaluated, Daly
stated, ‘‘Our realistic goal is to
make the tournament, and as
long as that goal stays realistic,
I feel we can stay Division I.”’
With that in mind, W&L head
lacrosse coach Dennis Daly
looks expectantly at his first
W&L season, not short on con-
fidence. Although a tradition
may have ended on July 19,
1983, perhaps one began on
September 1, 1983.

start, directed the W&L offense
with the poise of a veteran, as
he completed 17 of 25 passes for
129 yards and two touchdowns.
Of Wilson’s performance,
Fallon said, ‘‘We had to be
pleased with the job he did. He
made some mistakes that go
with inexperience. But overall,
he was in control of the situa-
tion.”’

Fallon also had praise for the
remainder of his backfield.

“Gene Girard ran the ball
really well and Frank Surface
did a good job both on short
yardage running and with his
blocking,” Fallon said.

Girard, who took over this
season for departed All-ODAC
performer Chris Cavalline,
rushed for 79 yards on 18 carries
while Surface added 35 yards on
9 attempts.

In the first quarter, Emory &
Henry took an early 7-0 lead on
an eight-yard run by Henry
Ferguson, who had 106 yards
rushing for the day. The Wasps
increased their lead to 14-0 in
the second quarter when Greg
Woolwine carried it in from the
two-yard line. The score re-
mained the same until half-
time.

After their lackadaisical play
in the first half, the Generals
quickly cut the Wasp lead in
half as Wilson passed to tight
end Ian Banwell for a four-yard
touchdown early in the third
quarter. James White added the
PAT and the score stood at 14-7.

The W&L defense, led by
senior linebacker and co-
captain John Cole, shut down
the Emory & Henry offense in
the third quarter. Cole had an
outstanding day (10 tackles, 7
assists), as did free safety Tim
Janyska (9 tackles, 3 assists, 1
fumble recovery) and corner-
back Barry Thompson (5
tackles, 2 assists, 1 intercep-
tion).

Wilson struck again at the
beginning of the fourth quarter
as he hit Gene Girard for two
yards and a touchdown. White’s
kick was once again good, tying
the score, 14-14.

With less than four minutes
remaining in the game, W&L
committed a fatal turnover as a
bobble in the backfield on a
hand-off resulted in a Wasp
recovery at the W&L six-yard-
line. On the next play, Ferguson
scored his second touchdown of

Soccer shaky early, downed by EMC, 4-2

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee soc-
cer team, suffering from first-
game-itis, according to Coach
Rolf Piranian, opened its
season Tuesday with a loss to
Eastern Mennonite, as_ the
visiting Royals took advantage
of early defensive mistakes by
the Generals and held on to win,
4-2.

Outshooting the Royals 27-12
for the game, Washington and
Lee dominated the scoreless se-
cond half, but the closest they
came to narrowing the gap was
a shot by freshman forward
Peter Van Son that grazed the
top of the crossbar with three
minutes left. Sophomore for-
ward Steve McGrath also had
two shots stopped. by royal
goalie Kevin Yoder in the se-
cond half.

“‘T thought we had a real fine
second half,” noted Piranian,
“although our shooting needed
work.”’

Piranian’s pre-game fears
that Eastern Mennonite, play-
ing in its fifth game of the
season, would have an adge in
experience came true, as the
Royals scored three unan-
swered goals in the first 18
minutes. ‘‘We certainly made
some bad mistakes, but that’s
going to happen in your first
game of the season,”’ said Pira-
nian.

The eighth-year coach also
warned that some changes in
the lineup could be made for
Saturday’s game at Averett. “It
looked like some players didn’t
want to work too hard for their
spots,”’ noted Piranian.

The Royals’ first goal came
when a mix-up between goalie
Jay Werner and his fullback

resulted in a 20-yard blast into

the net by Royal midfielder
Munir Abuznaid.

Four minutes later a center-
ing pass by the Royals’ Mike
Martin found midfielder David
Yoder, whose shot from ten
yards left Werner with no
chance.

Failure to clear the ball from
the Generals’ penalty box led to
a header by Mike Hurst that
gave the Royals a 3-0 lead at the
27:32 mark of the first half.

Numerous General forays in-
to Royal territory finally paid
off at the 22:06 mark when
senior co-captain Roland Simon
sent a 25-yard shot into the net.

W&L kept up the attack and
was rewarded with a corner
kick ten minutes later that
junior midfielder Jeff Reichert
headed home to cut the Royals’
lead to 3-2.

Eastern Mennonite finished
the scoring with 12 minutes left
in the half when John Wenger

Harriers
to defend

Crown

By RICK PIERCE
Staff Reporter

The defending Old Dominion
Athletic Conference champion
Generals prepare to defend
their title as their season opens
this Saturday at 11 p.m. The
W&L harriers will entertain
three teams, one of which
defeated the Generals last fall
(Mary Washington College).
The remaining two participants
are Washington College and
Newport News Apprentice
School.

Coach Dick Miller will once
again pull the strings in defend-
ing the ODAC crown. Miller in
his 32nd season at Washington
and Lee has built up an il-
lustrious record of 180 wins, 121
losses and 3 ties. Miller, who
was coach of the year in the
ODAC, attributes much of his
recent success to team depth.
‘“‘We feel we have quite a bit of
depth. We feel that we win most
of our meets because of our
depth. A team needs strong
depth because we don’t know
how each individual runner will
do from meet to meet. When one
individual has a bad day there
is always someone there to pick
up the slack.”

Depth, indeed. The Generals
are loaded with a full arsenal
again this fall. Senior Captain
Angus McBryde is back. Mc-
Bryde placed second a year ago
in the conference meet and is
W&L’s top runner. Another All-
Conference returnee is junior
Frank Pittman. Pittman placed
fifth in last year’s conference
meet. Other returning _let-
termen are senior Paul Chap-
man, junior Mark Penbrook
and sophomores Bob Glenn and
Ron Moody, who is currently in-
jured and will miss some ac-
tion.

Rounding out the rest of the
field are junior Ken Moles,
sophomores Tim Higgins, Jon
Elder, Eddie Goundry, and
freshmen Ted Myers and Ash
Andrews. The Generals are
deep again and look to possibly
repeat as conference cham-
pions with stiff competition
from Roanoke and Lynchburg.

Eller to speak tonight in chapel

Carl Eller, a former All-Pro
defensive lineman for the Min-
nesota Vikings, and Warren
Welsh, director of security for
the National Football League,
will present a drug education
program tonight.

Sponsored by Washington and
Lee’s department of athletics,
the program will begin at 8 p.m.
in Lee Chapel and will be open
to the public.

“Although the program will
be of interest to everyone, we
would particularly like to invite
the young athletes from the
area to join us for this presenta-
tion,’’ said William D.
McHenry, W&L’s director of
Athletics.

Eller, who is a chemical

dependency consultant to the
National Football League, will
relate his personal experience
with alcohol and drug abuse.

A star player at the Universi-
ty of Minnesota, Eller was nam-
ed to the NFL’s All-Pro team
five times and was voted the
Most Outstanding NFL Defen-
sive Lineman on two occasions.
He played in four Super Bowls
with the Vikings and was
selected for six appearances in
the Pro Bowl all-star game.

...Well, it looks as if the Soviet
downing of Korean Air Lines
Flight 007 is now going to affect
the world of sports. Before I
begin my tirade let me first re-
mind the conservative minds in
our number that politics and
sport do not mix well. (see
Olympics, Moscow, 1980, boy-
cott, failure). Nevertheless,

_ witness the brilliant (?) minds

of the California legislature who
unanimously (?) have passed a
resolution urging President
Reagan and Congress to bar the
Soviet Union from participating
in the 1984 Olympic Games in
Los Angeles. The theory is that
the Olympics are a political tool
for the Soviets, and to remove
that tool would serve as a just
punishment for their atrocious
act. Now, I’m not denying that
what the Soviets did was wrong.
That, I believe, is not the point.
If the Olympic Games have any
sort of political purpose (which
I extremely doubt), it is to bring
the nations of the world togeth-
er, not to tear them apart. Us-
ing athletic contests for
political purposes is to abuse
the rights of the participants.
Athletes are only political when
they are forced to be. This is
true of all athletes, Russians
most certainly included. The
downing of flight 007 should be
punished, but the punishment
should be doled out to those who
deserve it, not to innocent
athletes who would be the only
group truly hurt by such an act.
In the final analysis, I’m sure
all of us would rather the U.S.-
Soviet situation improve than
worsen. Banning the USSR
from our Olympics could only
make matters worse. Think
about it, Ronnie....

...Checking the colonnade, the
weekend proved somewhat dis-
mal on the results side, but
beyond that, there is cause for
optimism. In the pool, Page’s
polo players, although going
two up and three down at their
Invite, have to be pleased with

Rush ——

(continued from page 1)

Dean Murphy also urged that
if any students were confused or
had some unanswered ques-
tions to come by and see him or
anyone else associated with the
IFC.

Overall, IFC officials are
pleased with Rush at this time.
Clark said that he felt the Rush
system at W&L was “‘pretty
successful.”’

‘Most of the fraternities will
find the freshmen they’re in-
terested in, and the freshmen
will find the fraternities they’re
interested in.”

Although there have been no
major problems with this year’s
Rush, some Rush rules regula-
tions were broken, according to
IFC President Emery Ellinger.

Ellinge, reported that mem-
bers of Sigma Alpha Epsilon
fraternity entered the freshman
dorms during a ‘“‘no contact”
period, when there should be no
contact . between fraternity
members and anyone par-
ticipating in Rush, and illegally
took some freshmen to a party
in the country,

In response to the actions by
the fraternity members, the

IFC Judicial Board voted to put
the SAE fraternity on a one-
week probation, meaning par-
ties and other social activities
will not be permitted during
that week, The SAE’s punish-
ment goes into effect Sept. 29.

Another instance concerning
Rush rules being broken was
committed by the Kappa Alpha
Fraternity. According to Ell-
inger, some members of the KA
fraternity were caught
distributing ‘“‘Rush materials’’
to freshmen while in the dorms.
Although contact between
rushees and fraternity mem-
bers was allowed at the time of
the incident, offering any sort of
Rush material to freshmen is
forbidden Ellinger said. The
IFC Judicial Board decided to
fine the KA fraternity $100 for
their actions. Ellinger added
that he hoped the fine would set
a precedent for fraternities to
stay out of dorms, ‘“‘and that
any other action of similar
nature occuring would be
“dealt with harshly.”

Ellinger also wanted to point
out that there would be a 30

minute break (between the end
of the sixth Rush date (9:30

p.m.) and the time the rushees
could accept their bids (10
p.m.) this Friday night.

“The freshmen must be
brought back to the quad and
left there,’ Ellinger said. He
explained the reason for the 30-
minute delay was to help
“alleviate the probelm of
fraternities exerting pressure
on freshmen.”’

The responses among fresh-
men concerning the structure of
the Rush system varied. Those
students interviewed said they
all felt Rush was a valuable ex-
perience.

Another freshmen, Mark
Smith, described his Rush ex-
perience as ‘‘very hectic,’’ but
added, ‘‘I think it’s good.”’

Smith also explained that he
understood how some freshmen
could get ‘‘caught up in Rush.”
He said that a lot of rushees who
are ‘‘putting all their eggs in
one basket’ might not get a bid.
He added that fraternity Rush
was held too soon in the year
and that waiting until the se-
cond semester for Rush would
be more appropriate.

Yet Greg Lunsford felt dif-
ferently.

“T think it’s great,”’ he said.

Lunsford added that he was
glad to have the opportunity to
meet a lot of the upperclass-
men. ‘I know why they call it
Rush now,” he said.

VOLUME 83

Former
student
convicted

By RICK SWAGLER
Chief Editor

Former Washington and Lee
student Marc Ham _ pleaded
guilty on Monday in Rockbridge
County Circuit Court to posses-
sion of cocaine and sale of co-
caine and was placed in jail
pending the completion of a
presentence report.

Special Agent Wayne Oyler of
the Virginia State Police
testified Monday that last April
16, an informant bought one
ounce of cocaine from Ham.
The informant was identified in
court as Charles Phillips, a
W&L student at the time who
had been arrested previously on
drug charges.

Later that same day, Oyler
obtained a search warrant for
Ham’s room and confiscated
three more ounces of cocaine as
well as a hacksaw blade, a
razor blade, a spoon and other
items associated with the use or
preparation of cocaine.

Oyler testified that in 14 years
he had never seen cocaine as
pure as that confiscated from
Ham. The purity varied from 83
percent to 99 percent.

Oyler was hesitant about
placing a street value on the
drug but estimated that it could
sell for as much as $4,000 to
$5,000 per ounce.

Oyler testified that Ham had
been selling cocaine since his
freshman year at W&L and had
furnished the names of eight to
16 other students to the police.

Ham’s attorney requested
that Ham be placed in Rock-
bridge County jail pending the
presentence report so that he
might ‘‘get some time under his
belt.” Ham began serving time
in jail on Monday afternoon.

A presentence report is
designed to give the judge at the
sentencing a more thorough
knowledge of the defendant’s
background in the hope that the
sentence will be more fitting
and fair.

Prosecutor wants jail sentences for W&L students

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

There will be little trouble with
drug dealing on the Washington
and Lee campus in the future,
Commonwealth’s Attorney
Beverly C. ‘John’ Read said in
an interview last week.

“I’m not so naive to believe
that this will be the end of the
use of marijuana and cocaine at
W&L. And I certainly don’t con-
done it. But I really hope
that the message has gotten
through that you cannot sell
marijuana and cocaine and get
away with it,”’ Read said.

Read said that he will ask for
jail sentences in the cases of
two W&L students, Thomas J.

Rohrig and William L. Deder-
ick, who recently were con-
victed on drug charges. Read
emphasized that this would
mean that the two men would
serve up to 12 months in-the
Rockbridge County Jail.

“I would hate to send them to
prison. Prison can be a very
brutal place for a young male,”’
Read said.

Read, 39, said that so far
Rohrig and Dederick have been
cooperative in assisting in the
ongoing investigations of drug
dealing at W&L, Virginia
Military Institute and in the
community. The purpose of
these investigations is to catch
dealers who were above
Dederick and Rohrig on the
drug selling pyramid, Read
said.

Read said that in the case of
large scale dealers he would
ask for prison sentences.

‘“‘The more a person sells and
where he is on the pyramid of
selling determines what kind of
sentence he will get,’ said
Read.

Read added that he felt a
tremendous amount of compas-
sion for the families and friends
of Rohrig and Dederick. Read
said that he thought it was un-
fortunate that they got involved
in selling drugs.

To fight marijuana and co-
caine use in the community in
the future, Read said that he
supports the purchase of a drug
detecting dog for the communi-
ty at a cost of $8000.

“These dogs are immensely
effective,’ said Read. ‘‘Utiliza-

Experiment
backfires

By TED LECLERQ
Staff Reporter

As Eddie Murphy and Dan
Ackroyd were the victims of a
sociology experiment in their
summer hit movie, ‘Trading
Places,” so was the Washington
and Lee community fooled last
spring.

Although Murphy and Ack-
royd’s movie has been well
publicized, little has been said
about the experiments of stu-
dents in Assistant Professor
David Novack’s sociological de-
viance class last spring.
According to Professor Novack,
all but two of the experiments
achieved acceptable results.

The two experiments from
Sociology 270 that did not go
over quietly were the projects
of then juniors Ben St. Clair and
Todd Howe.

St. Clair’s experiment was

chances of success of a drug in-
vestigation and is an invaluable
tool to local law enforcement
agencies,”’ Read said.

In another matter, Read said
that during his eight years in of-
fice he has stuck to his 1975
campaign promise not to en-
gage in excessive plea bargain-
ing.

“Every single time there has
been a plea agreement the law
enforcement officer involved in
the case and the victim of the
crime have signed the plea
agreement,’’ Read said.

Read said he will only enter
into a plea bargain agreement
when the defendant is alreadv
receiving a prison or jail
sentence, when the defendant

Eller, Welsh comment on abuse em

By GREG AYDT
Special to the Phi

Carl Eller. The name carries
with it a host of memories. A
member of the feared ‘Purple
People Eaters’’ defense of the
Minnesota Vikings, Carl Eller
played in five Pro-Bowls and on
four Super Bowl teams. Yet the
public never saw another side of
Car] Eller, the secret part of his
life that cost him his marriage,
his money and a number of
jobs. Carl Eller was addicted to
alcohol, marijuana and co-
caine.

Today, Carl] Eller is ‘‘clean,’’
and has made for himself a new
life, working for the National
Football League as a consultant
on drug abuse. Last Thursday
night, Carl Eller and Warren
Welsh, Director of NFL Securi-
ty, spoke to a near capacity
crowd in Lee Chapel, on the pro-
blems associated with drug
abuse, especially as they relate
to athletes.

The subject was one of major
interest to the audience, many
of whom were athletes them-
selves, given the recent revela-
tions, by both former and pre-
sent NFL players, of drug abuse
within the league, as well as the
recent suspension of four NFL

players for drug related ac-
tivites. The speakers avoided
the sensationalism of recent
press accounts, choosing in-
stead to present a factual case
which attempted to put the re-
cent incidents in a new light.
Both stressed the fact that drug
use exists in all segments of
society and that the recent
media accounts of recent drug-
related problems in the NFL ex-
aggerate the extent of the drug
use within the league. But
Welsh was quick to add that
“one (drug user) is one too
many.’’ Commenting on the re-
cent press coverage, Welsh
found fault with some of the
more sensational aspects of the
coverage as well as its extent,
but recognized that members of
the NFL “‘live in a fishbowl,”
and that such attention is a part
of the territory.

Both men also stressed that
the biggest drug problem in the
NFL is alcohol, not cocaine.
Eller, in recounting his own
dependence, explained that he,
like many of the players in the
NFL who are “‘chemically de-
pendent,’’ began his odyssey as
a teenager using alcohol, only
gradually moving on to other
drugs while searching for a
steady high. In addition, he

pointed out that many coaches
and league officials didn’t
recognize the problem as what
it was, because they didn’t
know what they were looking at.

Both Eller and Welsh also
took issue with those who would
see players involved with drugs
barred from the league as miss-
ing the point. The NFL views
drug abuse as an illness, ‘“‘and
whatever the (player’s) pro-
blems are, they are viewed as
stemming from that illness.” In
addition, Eller pointed out that
while many players are put ona
pedestal and looked up to as
heroes, this is done by the
public, and “sometimes an
athlete neither wants nor ac-
cepts that responsibility ,’’ mak-
ing it grossly unfair to hold the
athlete to a higher standard of
conduct merely because they
are in the limelight.

On a more positive note, it
was pointed out that because of
the recent publicity about drug
abuse and league involvement
in helping the athletes with drug
problems, drug abuse is de-
creasing within the league.
That’s something you don’t
read too often in the press, but
it’s something everyone who
cares about sports should know,
because ultimately, that’s the
thing that really matters.

He who hesitates is lost...

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

... There’s a saying in sports
that is as applicable to what
happened on Rhode Island
Sound as it is succinct. That
saying, ‘No guts, no glory,” ap-
plies to Australia II skipper
John Bertrand. Liberty’s skip-
per Dennis Conner is probably
still wandering around, wonder-
ing what happened to the race
and Cup that he thought were
his. The simple fact regarding
the seventh race in the
ROC ge «8 cae
Australia’s...Cup was that the
Australians played to win and
Americans a.k.a. Dennis Con-

sider this about the series:

Liberty led the series 3-1 and
the final race by 57 seconds on
the next to last leg. The question
is how do you lose from that ad-
vantage? What happened to Mr.
Conner was perhaps that he
forgot he could lose, that he
breathed a sigh of relief too
soon. The gutsy fifth leg
maneuver of the Australians
earned them the cup. The com-
placent safe sailing of the
Americans earned them the
defeat...

...Wilson Field was the site of
a football team coming into
their own. The Generals dis-
played near perfection on de-
fense and offense last weekend.

With Gene Girard averaging
seven yards a carry and Bobby
Wilson getting more than 120
yards in total offense a game,
W&L is as offensively strong as
it could hope for. Defensively,
the Generals were able to get
the big play when they needed
it. If the Generals can play this
well at Game Two in the
schedule, imagine where they’ll
be at season’s end...One other

for polo. They’re getting
stronger every weekend, and by
November they should be in top
form for the Southern Cham-

Harriers look strong

By RICK PIERCE
Staff Reporter

The 1983 harriers of
Washington and Lee got their
season off to a fast start. The
Generals won a four team meet
here in Lexington last Satur-
day. The Generals took first,
under the fast-paced direction
of Angus McBryde, Frank Pitt-
man and Paul Chapman, fin-
ishing second, third, and fourth,
respectively, with a score of 28.
Mary Washington College plac-
ed second with a count of 40
points. Newport News Appren-
tice School, who incidentally
had the top finisher in the meet,
Martin Nixon, placed third in
overall scoring. Washington
College finished last in team
scoring.

Generals’ coach Dick Miller
commented, ‘‘We ran excep-
tionally well for this early in the
season. I am pleased with

everyone’s performance.”’ Also
scoring for W&L were Eddie
Goundry, who placed ninth and
right behind him was freshman
Ted Myers, finishing the top
five scoring Generals.

Although Coach Miller
believes in the philosophy of
taking one meet at a time, he
and his squad must now concen-
trate on this week’s foes. The
Generals will be joined with
Roanoke College in a tri-squad
meet at Norfolk State Universi-
ty this Saturday, ‘‘We are going
from a tough, hilly course of our
own to a basically flat course at
Norfolk, which could hurt,” ex-
pressed a concerned Miller.

Coach Miller still remains
very optimistic, ‘‘We’re
stronger at this point in the
season than we were last year
(ODAC Champions) and Bob
Glenn will also add to our score
this week.” Glenn was sidelined
last week due to an illness.

Opinion

Anonymity versus the photograph

they saw him during the day (the student is allowed to at-
tend classes but must return to jail at night) they’d be apt
to single him out. What’s more, the critics asked why put
his picture and not the pictures of the other two mentioned
in the article?

Ring-tum Phi chief Editors Rick Swagler and John
Cleghorn hadn’t anticipated the criticism. They acted
automatically in printing the photograph. ‘‘We didn’t even
think about it,”’ Cleghorn said.

Their reason for running the picture, Cleghorn said, was
that ‘“‘It helps the reader to identify the person. On a small
campus like W&L, I guess some people thought that such
identification wasn’t necessary,’ he said.

Even with the criticism, the Phi editors agree that they
were right in printing the photograph. ‘‘I don’t think the
size of the campus should affect the students’ right to
know,” Swagler said. ‘‘We didn’t really see any reason not
uched by the problem of drugs. It, too, has been shocked to run the picture. He was president of his fraternity, a
' the reality that not all W&L men are free from corrup- leader on campus and was the only current student involv-
mn. ed.”

In its first issue, the Ring-tum Phi reported the convic- 5
Readers’ Advocate

accused drug dealer John DeLorean over its pages, and
not a single person probably thought anything about it.

Obviously the Phi is not the Washington Post. Never-
theless, the Phi is a real newspaper, and should therefore
be governed by the same journalistic rules as the Post, the
New York Times or any other major big-city newspaper.

The critics’ main thrust however is that the size of the
campus didn’t justify printing the picture. Because W&L
is a small college, most people probably already knew
who the student was just by seeing the name. By printing
his picture critics said the Phi wasn’t just reporting the
student, it was dragging his name through the mud.

The size of a newspaper or of the city it serves shouldn’t
dictate the journalistic rules that newspaper will follow.
Whether W&L is made up of a hundred people or a hun-
dred-thousand, the Phi should adhere to the same set of
principles.

The student whose picture appeared was convicted of a
felony. He was tried and found guilty. That’s news, and if
a picture of the student adds to the article or helps the
reader visualize the person whom he’s reading about then
it should be run.

Those sympathetic to the convicted student may cry
that the Phi ‘“‘ganged up”’ on him. It may appear to them
that the Phi ganged up. In reality, however, the Phi just

uthern town. Here boys are molded into men as they

But the rosy picture of this majestic university has been
riously flawed, flushing the image of the W&L

Drug use is a highly sensitive topic, a mine that when
uched immediately explodes in controversy, criticism,

The nation has awakened to the extent of the problem

ared on the front page. Along with it ran a picture of one

Criticism of the Phi immediately surfaced. Many stu-
nts were angered, not by the story being printed but at

id, was unnecessary. It served no purpose except to
ace an additional stigma on the convicted student. On a

The line between reporting the news and sensationaliz-

campus it’s barely discernible.

In this case, critics believe the Phi was guilty of cross-

face they’d recognize as ‘‘the W&L gentleman who went

Sit back and cool out

By MARKHAM SHAW PYLE

To most of us, this seems a

trange time of year for the
naking of New Year’s resolu-
ions. But it is a new year, of
‘ourse; and for the Class of
987, a new life. And it is to them
particularly wish to speak.

On a recent Saturday, I took
ome time and went to Goshen,
ust me and my Coors. By great
‘ood fortune, I found what must
ave been the only secluded
tretch of the Maury within 20
niles. I then and there caught
ip with five faithful friends
yhom I had sadly neglected of
ate. Their names are Touch,
‘aste, Sight, Smell and Sound.

It is fatally easy for us in this
nvironment to come down with
cute tunnel vision. The next
risis, the short term outlook,
hat blasted deadline...tonight,
x the next day, or the next
Jass meeting. An _ endless
eries of hurdles, and all close
ogether. We have little time to
90k ahead for miles, to dawdle,
nd to plan. Something always
equires our more immediate
ttention. Even our
musements are locked in to
ome schedule. We party under
he gun.

I say we don’t have time to
ake time, to collect ourselves
nd do some horizon-scanning.
Ve could make time, though, if
ve tried. But we let it be stolen
y triviality, we are busy being
hivvied about by a whole hunt-
ag pack of Heres and Nows,
nd we’re too tired to force a
eather on ourselves.

Now, if there is one place
here this way of life is stark
asensibility, it is this Universi-
y. You are shocked: this is the

land of deadlines. But think; we
concentrate on the test-
measured, the numbers, the
useless, when we think that
way; because we have confused
training with education. W&L
has always finally remembered
that distinction — at least, so
far; may it continue to do so
now. We really know, though we
don’t always act like it, that
classroom learning is barely
the half of education. We know
that the already dated and
remarkably mediocre texts and
technical books of our day are
at best harmlessly irrelevant
and at worst outright lies; and
so we do put the emphasis of
education where it belongs.
Where’s that? It’s in the books
and the beers and the basset
hounds that have stood the test
of time and even survived being
Approved by the Establish-
ment. It’s in Dickens and
Trollope and A.A. Milne; in
Maker’s Mark and spring
water; and at county fairs and
sausage-makings and in the
leaves of autumn. Those are the
things that matter. When we
meet our maker, I seriously
doubt he’ll give a tinker’s dam
about our understanding of the
politics of municipal elections
in East Blowhard.

Now let me say two things. If
you’re taking a course in
municipal elections in the small
town, give it all you’ve got. You
aren’t worth that same tinker’s
dam if you don’t; whether or not
anybody else knows that fact,
you will. And that reeks,
friends. And yes, there are
moral obligations anyone wor-
thy of his salt’ll take seriously ;

but if he’s any good at all, he
won’t take himself seriously in
the process. That’s what I’m
talking about here; com-
prende?

But my advice as a whole is
simple. Read more, but read
cause you want to. If you don’t
like an author but think you
‘ought’ to, bag the project. Lik-
ing an author is as unpredic-
table as falling in love; and
don’t concern yourself with it if
the match seems unsuitable
somehow.

We learn minor matters from
charts and graphs. We get to
know God and the Cosmos and
women and truth and our own
selves through reason, served
by those faithful retainers I took
to Goshen: our senses. Use ’em,
man, use ’em. Have an honest
beer and a roast beef sandwich
for lunch. Play with a
dachshund, and ignore the
chuckles of the elegant, the
sophists, and the refined. (God
knows the dachshund will.) If
you’re down, reread ‘‘Winnie
the Pooh,”’ and avoid like the
plague any work recommended
as ‘important.’ Go to that purest
of sports, the small town high
school football game. Listen to
birds. Smell woodsmoke on a
cold wind. Climb trees. And at
all costs, stop standing in front
of that damned mental mirror
we all have, the one we preen in
front of. Stop worrying about
how you're looking. It took me a
long wicked time to learn that.
Don’t you start.

So, in a phrase: welcome to
the big time. But don’t pay it
any mind. The first and the
great commandment is: Cool

Ethics, rationality

and the arms race

By TOM CONNORS
Special to the Phi

Unfortunately, the word
‘‘prophet”’ is commonly used to-
day to mean ‘‘one who predicts
the future.”’ This, however, is
misleading, for prophets con-
centrate more directly on the
present. The future they see is
one they derive from their view
of what will occur if the evils of
the day are left uncorrected.
Thus, in Dickens’ ‘A Christmas
Carol,” the Ghost of Christmas
Yet to Come, acting as a pro-
phet, forsees a bad end for Tiny
Tim should his situation remain
unchanged. The ghost predicts
the future of the present in a
sense, but it is valid only if the
time’s evils continue unchang-
ed. His prophecy is forceful
enough to change even
Ebenezer Scrooge.

This is the light in which we
must view the upcoming visit of
Bishop Walter Sullivan to Wash-
ington and Lee on Oct. 4, and
the recent Bishops’ Letter on
Nuclear Armaments. The
bishop’s address, ‘‘Peacemak-
ing in a Nuclear Age,” will
discuss the rationality and
ethics of the arms race.

Since 1945, we have delegated
the care of nuclear arms to tem-
poral powers. The result has
been unencouraging: a seem-
ingly unending arms race, the
use of the nuclear balance for
political means (i.e., getting
elected), an extension of the
rhetoric and propaganda of Mc-
Carthyism, and a long series of

meaningless, ineffective pro-
posals to end the race. It is clear
that politicians have little con-
cept of our weapons’ capabili-
ties. The present administra-
tion talks of “limited nuclear
exchanges” and “winning a
nuclear war,”’ as if they knew of
what they spoke. Yet no world
leader of today has ever seen a
nuclear explosion. Those who
have, survivors of Los Alamos
and other test grounds, are
thoroughly frightened and have
come to some kind of terms
with the likelihood of an upcom-
ing doomsday. Our leaders do
not share these feelings. John
Kennedy and Ronald Reagan
were both elected waving the
red flag of the so-called “‘win-
dow of vulnerability’””» —which
in both cases was _ untrue
statesman. Likewise, the arms
reduction proposals have pro-
ven to be equally immature.
The USSR offers only proposals
which would leave itself with
the upper hand. We do precisely
the same.

The bishops, in their letter,
call upon us to begin the long
journey to rid our planet of the
means for its destruction:

“As Americans, citizens of
the nation which was the first to
produce atomic weapons, which
has been the only one to use
them, and which today is
capable of decisively influenc-
ing the course of the nuclear
age, we have grave human,
moral and political respon-
sibilities to see that a ‘conscious
choice’ is made to save humani-
ty.” (continued on page 12)

A decision on coeducation at

coeducation ‘‘is an issue that’s

“They’re really looking at it

Among aspects of coeduca-

Judge said, was the question of
“if we stay single-sex, 10 years
down the road will we have to
drop our academic standards?”

Judge also said that some
long-range plans are being
made regarding student hous-
ing and other university
facilities, and these would be

to go coeducational.

the first-year law and freshman
class elections are over.

Fraternities at Washington
and Lee also dominated the
alumni meetings, Judge said.

Alumni feel ‘‘the fraternities
are an embarrassment to the
university,” he said. “It’s just
hit rock bottom.’ Suggestions
for improving the system in-
cluded having all officers live in
the fraternity houses and hav-
ing the advisers play more ac-
tive roles.

Judge said that university
President John Wilson will
meet with all fraternity
presidents tonight in Lee
Chapel. The meeting will be
open to other fraternity mem-
bers and the student body.

In other action Monday, the
EC announced that elections for
the first-year law rep will be
held Monday, with run-offs
Thursday.

Elections for freshman class

with run-offs Thursday, Oct. 13.
Petitions for those elections
must have 50 signatures and

Two subcommittees were
formed also Monday. Darby

By MIKE ALLEN

Staff Reporter
A pair of Washington and Lee
students has been given the
identities of two people who
have confessed to assaulting

them on Sept. 18, but as of late
Wednesday the two had not
pressed charges.

Lexington Police Chief
Lawrence O. Sutton released
the names and addresses of two
black male Lexington residents
to junior Ed Buttarazzi and
senior Roger McDonough at a
meeting in his office last Friday
afternoon.

He instructed the students
that in order to institute legal
proceedings, they must visit a
local magistrate and request a
warrant for the arrest of the
confessed attackers, which the
police department would then
serve.

‘“‘This is a criminal charge of
assault which you originate as
victims,’ Sutton told them.
‘“‘The decision whether or not to

prosecute is yours....

“The police department has
gone as far as any department
can to assist you at this noint ”’
he said. ‘‘Now the ball is in your
court.”’

Buttarazzi, who received
bruises and a black eye from
the assailants, said Tuesday
afternoon that no action had
been taken because ‘‘we just
want to see if we want to get in-
volved.”

McDonough, who suffered a
broken nose in the encounter,
cited “schedule conflicts’ be-
tween the two as the reason for
the lack of movement in the
case.

Sutton confirmed that “a
magistrate has not delivered
the warrant.”’

At the Friday meeting, Sutton
told Buttarazzi and McDon-
ough, ‘‘As a result of this in-
vestigation, we have talked
with these individuals, and they

have admitted they were in a
fight with you.”

He added, “I will tell you,
though, that their story of what
happened is different from
yours.”

‘‘What you do is entirely up to
you,” he told them. ‘If you
decide to prosecute, we will go
into court and testify that these

individuals admitted assaulting
you....

‘‘We’re here to help you, and
we will help you. The possible
we do immediately; the im-
possible takes a little longer.”’

Sutton permitted a reporter to
be present during the session.
Investigating officer Steven E.
Crowder was also in atten-
dance. :

“we will assist you in getting
a conviction,’’ Crowder told the
students.

Sutton questioned the stu-
dents briefly to confirm the
police report taken when the in-
cident occurred.

“Correct me if I’m wrong,”
he said. ‘‘You stated that you’d
been drinking too much at the
time.”

“‘We were drinking,’”’” McDon-
ough acknowledged.

“Correct me if I’m wrong,”
Sutton continued. ‘‘At the time,
you said you didn’t have much
interest in prosecuting.”’

“We said we weren't pre-
pared to prosecute,’’
McDonough said.

Buttarazzi added, however,
‘“‘Now we’d both be interested in
prosecuting and seeing a magis-
trate.”

The police report shows that
on Sept. 18, Buttarazzi and
McDonough claimed that their
assailants had been six to eight
in number.

Sutton said in an interview on
Tuesday, however, ‘‘The best
we can determine from the two
(that have been identified),
they were the only ones involv-
ed.

“We have no evidence to sup-
port that there were more than

two involved.”

Sutton would say only that the
two had confessed ‘‘to set the
record straight.”

The police chief said that “‘if
we had arrested at least two of

the people” that the students
had mentioned that night, But-
tarazzi and McDonough ‘‘would
have been charged with false
arrest.

“One of the people they were

Experiment

(continued from page 1)
designed to see how people
would react when he wore band-
ages over his eyes and told
them he could possibly be blind
for life.

Howe’s goal was to see the
response of people when he
married a Hollins girl without
any previous hint of a romance.

Both St. Clair’s and Howe’s
projects involved difficult
ethical questions, all of those in-
volved admitted. Yet, the stu-
dents continued to question,
how does one balance the im-
portant need for data from
human research with the weigh-
ty ethical considerations?

“There are several camps
that people fall into on this
issue,” said Washington and
Lee ethics professor Louis

Hodges. ‘“‘The polar arguments
are that the gain of data out-
weighs the loss of ethics or that
people have an absolute right
not to be deceived.”

Ben St. Clair said he told his

friends last spring what had
happened to him. St. Clair said
he told people that he had gone
home for the weekend to Glas-
gow. He had been helping his
mother work on her rose
garden. While spraying those
roses, St. Clair told his friends,
,a cannister of insecticide had
burst in his face. He then wrap-
ped his face with wide strips of
gauze and told his friends that
he could be permanently blind.
“The goal of the course was to

discover what makes an act de-
viant,”’ St. Clair said. “We tried

to limit it to campus, but it
didn’t work. My sister had peo-
ple coming up to her in Glasgow
and asking about me. My
mother even had a lawyer ap-
proach her. He was already
wondering about filing a suit.”’

“IT wanted to better under-

talking about as an assailant
apparently actually tried to aid
them.”

Buttarazzi was quoted earlier
as saying that he didn’t ‘“‘think
the police responded very well
to’’ the incident.

“When you’re hurt, every
hour seems like days,”’ Sutton
told the two on Friday.

Buttarazzi says now, “That
was my immediate opinion.

Seeing what they’ve done,
they’ve performed better than I
thought they would.”’

“The investigation has been
continuing since the assault was
first reported,’ Sutton said
Tuesday.

“‘We never stop trying to find
out who’s responsible, whether
or not the victims decide to pro-
secute. We want to know who’s
causing problems in the city.’’

 

stand people with physical
stigmas,” St. Clair continued,
“‘What would people’s reaction
be to my blindness. We wanted

to learn about it.

“It was an opportunity to ex-
perience deviance first hand,”’
he continued. ‘And it fit in well
with my Muscular Dystrophy
work.”’

Before the project got under-
way, however, there was dis-
cussion among the class and be-
tween St. Clair and Novack. Yet
few people in the student body
knew about the experiment.

gest problems later, St. Clair
said.

“IT was deceiving close
friends,’’ St. Clair said.

‘Afterwards, what would
their reaction be? It was about
a week later when two of my
friends’ anger really built up.
We almost came to blows.

“T was very sorry about that.
Looking back, I would not do it
again for the world because it
hurt too many people.”

There were over 25 people in
Todd Howe’s Woods Creek
apartment looking on when he
got married, Howe said.

was limited to the class, St.

Clair’s adviser, his immediate
family, and his employer, St.
Clair said. The limited class
discussion seemed positive
about St. Clair’s project, he
said.

“The experiment,’’ said St.
Clair, ‘‘was an excellent oppor-
tunity to experience those im-
pairments and grow.”’

“It was a learning experience
for me, but looking back, it was
a poor experiment,” St. Clair
said.

Most of the campus believed
St. Clair was blind. His closest
friends had come to his aid to
make sure that he got dressed
properly and did not injure
himself on the way to class. Yet,
his friends’ helpful reaction

periment,” said Howe. “It was
my initiative to go and talk to
him (Novack) about it — I
didn’t have to.”’

“I had told my friends it
would be an informal ceremony
sO no one went out and rented a

tux. One guy got mad because
he had his jacket cleaned, but I
paid him back for that,’’ Howe
said.

“The ceremony was short
—maybe five minutes. We had
one student pose as a preacher.
At the end (of the vows) we
even kissed like any bride and
groom,” Howe said.

‘Afterward, we had a recep-
tion,’ he said, ‘‘That was all
there was to that phase.”’

Howe said he had alerted his
parents although the girl’s
parents did not know it was an
experiment at the time of the
wedding.

Howe said the bride’s parents
learned of the marriage and did
not find out it was a charade un-
til some days later. Howe said
the explanatory letter the bride
had sent her parents did not ar-
rive on time.

“IT never expected any of the
reaction I got,’’ Howe said. ‘‘I

Because he knew his ac-
complice would be testifying
against him, Hall pleaded guilty
and waived the right to a jury
trial, Read said. In a jury trial
the jury would not have been in-
formed of Hall’s_ previous
criminal record, and he would
have received a_ lighter
sentence than the one he got
from the judge, Read said.

Read said that in all cases,
regardless of whether or not it
involves a plea bargain, the vic-
tim of the crime is informed of
all developments in the case.

“I’m one of a very few
Virginia commonwealth’s at-
torneys who takes the time to
speak to the victim of the crime
and the law enforcement officer
involved,”’ Read said.

Read said that the Rock-
bridge County and Lexington
Victim-Witness Assistance Pro-
gram is considered to be one of
the finest in the state. The pro-
gram operates out of Read’s of-
fice and is coordinated by Deb-
bie Nicely.

“‘To many victims the trial is
a very important moment in
their lives. They appreciate
knowing when the case comes
to court,’’ said Read.

Read, a Republican, is seek-
ing a third four-year term as
Commonwealth’s Attorney for
Rockbridge County and Lex-
ington in the Nov. 8 election.

“T have enjoyed serving this
community as commonwealth’s
attorney for eight years. I hope
I have the good fortune to serve
for another four years,’’ Read
said.

Read said that he had no am-
bitions to hold any political of-
fice higher than common-
wealth’s attorney.

“T enjoy being a criminal pro-
secuter. While people have ask-
ed me to run for other offices, I
have said no each time,’’ Read
said.

Read said that the 12 years of
experience he has gained as a
trial lawyer have been in-
valuable to him in seeing that
justice is done in the court.

Read also said that his three
years at Washington and Lee
Law School were important in
preparing him to be a trial
lawyer. Read was captain of the
Moot Court Team while in law
school.

Read worked for a Richmond
law firm for three years before
being elected Commonwealth’s
Attorney for Rockbridge Coun-
ty and Lexington in November,
1975.

Regarding the purpose of the
criminal justice system, Read
said that the system should
punish criminals, serve as a
deterrent against potential
criminals and_ rehabilitate
criminals.

Read graduated from VMI in
1965. He was a captain in the
U.S. Army in Vietnam from
1965 to 1968 during which time
he was awarded a Bronze Star
and a Purple Heart.

Mock Convention
Correspondent

Mock: (adj.)-merely im-
itating or resembling reality;
sham.

Although Webster meant well
with his definition, it still lacks
the essence of what Washington
and Lee’s Mock Convention,
scheduled for May 11 and 12,
1984, is all about. Admittedly
not reality, the past Mock Con-
ventions held at W&L were far
from shams and were closer to
the Richmond Times-Dis-
patch’s characterization of the
convention as ‘‘the most ac-
curate event of its kind in the
nation.”

Accuracy, authenticity, years
of planning and attention to
detail are the staples of the
mock convention experience
and have been for the past 75
years.

This is not to say however,
that the Mock Convention has
not undergone some changes
over the years. When the idea of
a mock convention was first
suggested by an assistant pro-
fessor of economics and
politics, W. Jett Lauck, and in-
troduced to the public by The
Ring-tum Phi in April, 1908, im-
partiality was not exactly the
prevailing spirit: ‘‘All students
are urged to arouse interest in
the convention and to work in
behalf of their favorite presi-
dential candidate,’ the news-
paper announced.

With a campus that was as
solidly Democratic as the rest
of the South, nothing but a
Democratic convention was
even considered back in the ear-
ly days of the convention.

Those early days of 1908 not
only brought the first Mock Con-
vention to W&L but also the first
correct prediction. William Jen-
nings Bryan, already a two-
time presidential loser for the
real Democrats, was the lead-
ing contender at W&L after fir-
ing up the students with a
speech upon his arrival in Lex-
ington.

As the first convention opened
on May 4, Minnesota Governor
John A. Johnson had almost
enough support to halt a Bryan
sweep. Both sides were poised
for the competition and com-
pete they did. Floor fights
prevailed and became disrup-
tive as these brawls occurred on
the floor! When the final bell
rang at the end of only one
round, Bryan was declared the
victor of W&L’s delegates. That
choice was echoed when the
real Democratic delegates met
in Denver that summer.

Bryan went down in defeat for
the third and last time in the
general election against
William Howard Taft. So 1912
brought W&L students back to
the drawing board as, of course,
another Democratic convention
was held with the hope of not on-
ly choosing the accurate presi-
dential nominee again, but also
of tapping a candidate who
could defeat the Republicans.

They were granted half their
wish.

After five roll calls at W&L,
the students nominated Gover-
nor Judson Harmon of Ohio
over Woodrow Wilson, governor
of New Jersey. Later in
Baltimore the real Democrats
gave the convention nod to
Wilson instead, who went on to
capture the White House.

Mock Convention: a history of accuracy

12 of 17 correct predictions

 

A scene from the floor at the 1980 Mock Convention. (File photo.)

‘rhe year 1916 was a pivotal
one in the history of the conven-
tion. Faced with a_ strong
Democratic incumbent presi-
dent in Wilson, (whose nomina-
tion was not in danger) the
students at W&L wondered
what they were to do. After
weeks of discussion, the ‘‘earth-
shattering’’ decision was made
to hold a Republican conven-
tion.

With a still overwhelmingly
Democratic campus and none
of the Republicans being exact-
ly ‘‘personal favorites’ the
students found the need for ac-
tual research. Thus, the modern
day W&L convention tradition
of predicting the presidential
nominee of the party out of the
White House was born.

Impartial research may have
been initiated out of necessity
but it proved accurate as

Mays moved to grant the per-

imposed. Phillips then sug-
gested to Mays that the motion
be re-stated so that Smith would
be granted the conditional use
permit subject to ‘‘certain
regulations to be negotiated
before the next meeting.”’ The
new motion was then passed
unanimously.

“‘The whole thing was totally
unecessary,’’ Smith said after
the hearing. “I think it was
stupid.”

Smith complained that the ci-
ty needed to define the or-
dinance more clearly before en-
forcing it.

He added that his business
had been damaged by the
lengthy process.

“It just goes on and on and

Smith said the ordinance is

Not all cadets
choose military

By SCOTT KENNEDY
Special to the Phi

Although all of the cadets at
the Virginia Military Institute
are enrolled in ROTC and are
obligated to serve in their
selected branch of the military
after graduation, only about 11
percent of the cadets choose the
military as a career.

Because such a small number
of the graduates stay in the
military, VMI has a large place-
ment service which the men can
use when they leave the service,
according to Lt. Col. Royce E.
Jones, head of cadet affairs at
VMI.

“If a guy goes on active duty
for three, five, six or seven
years and then comes off active
duty, he again registers for
placement services and we go
through the job-search pro-
cess,‘‘ Jones said.

The placement service is also
open to cadets looking for sum-
mer jobs. In fact, according to

tion’s comprehensive budget re-
quest to the Executive Commit-
tee is titled, ‘‘Hey Buddy, Can
You Spare $13,632?”

The EC actually has
$108,067.50 in student taxes to
distribute among 16 student
organizations.

Here’s the catch though.
Those student organizations
have requested $172,414 in
operating funds for the 1983-84
academic year.

Tonight at 8:30 the EC will
begin deliberations in a process
representing a departure from
the norm over the past few

years.

Previously, the EC had made
a tentative decision on funds for
each committee immediately
after that committee had de-
fended its budget requests.

Although budget hearings
began Tuesday evening, no
decisions will be made until all
committees have presented
their budgets this year.

Hearings were held Tuesday
evening for 11 organizations,
ranging from the Mock Conven-
tion, asking for $13,632, to the
Hockey Club, asking for $390.

Tonight’s hearings begin at 7
p.m. with the Student Bar
Association and continue with
the Student Association for
Black Unity, the Student Ac-
tivities Board, the Ariel and the
Excelsior.

Thi: service provided for VMI
alumni and cadets is dependent
on the aid of placement volun-
teers. An alumnus can register
to be a placement volunteer
which means he uses _ his
business contacts to help secure
jobs for cadets and alumni,
Jones said.

Not only is the placement of-
fice used to find jobs, it is also
used by employers. Jones said
that he is constantly being con-
tacted by alumni looking to fill
an opening. In short Jones said,
the placement office at VMI
acts as an employment agency
for it’s cadets and alumni; it
finds jobs and fills openings.

The office depends on the
alumni for placement volun-
teers but also for monetary sup-
port, Jones said.

“Our operating budget for our
placement services is through
the VMI Foundation and pri-
vate funds,’’ he explained.

Developer Clyde H. Mull an-
nounced Monday the comple-
tion of the first townhouses to be
constructed in the Rockbridge
area: Lexington Townhomes.

One unit was completely fur-
nished on Tuesday, right down
to the towels and place settings
by Schewel and Leggett, in
preparation for the open house
Mull will be holding Sept. 30
through Oct. 2.

The controversial project,
which drew resistance from
both the city and neighbors, is
right next to the city/county
line. The townhouses are
located off Thorn Hill Road on
Lexington Avenue, which was
created for the development.

“‘Lexington’s been here for
over two hundred years, and
there was no Lexington Avenue,
and we thought there ought to
be,’’ Mull said.

The developer said the five
units, the first of the five phases
he plans for the site, will pro-
bably spur the building of other
similar projects in this area.

“‘T think there are going to be
more,’’ he said.

Lexington Townhomes, which
took five months to actually
build, has been in the planning
stages for at least five years,
according to Mull, who has been
self-employed since leaving the
state police force twelve years
ago.

Much of that pre-construction
time was spent in hearings with
the Lexington Planning Com-
mission and City Council.

Mull originally proposed a
cluster arrangement for the
five units, but since he was
unable to secure the necessary
changes in the zoning or-
dinances, they have been built
in the more traditional linear
scheme.

Nearby residents were wor-
ried about problems with traffic
and surface water runoff which
might result from the develop-
ment.

“Naturally, they’re going to
be concerned about what’s
upstream,’’ said Mull, who had
his plans checked by a con-
sulting engineer and by Central
Shenandoah Planning District
officials from Staunton.

‘People are reluctant to see
any change,” he continued. “It
was fear of the unknown — not
knowing many months ago
what this was going to look like.

“T live right across the hill, so
I'll see that it’s well manicured
and well cared for, so anyone
living here would be proud to
call this their home.”’

Mull is enthusiastic as he
takes a visitor through the
homes, continuously using
words like ‘‘huge,”’ ‘‘the latest’’
and ‘‘the best.”’

“T think the purchaser, for
what he’s paying, is getting an
excellent deal,’ hesaid. «

He also hopes it will be a
“money-making proposition.”’
“T am in the free enterprise
system, and that’s the name of
the game,’’ Mull said. ‘‘I should
be able to turn a profit.”

During construction, Mull
emphasized energy efficiency
in the designs, which is seen in
features like double windows, a
triple-insulated smoke pipe on
the chimney, and energy-saving
metal doors.

The developer said such
features are important be-
cause, although people have

By G. BRUCE POTTER

Although most positions for
the 1984 Washington and Lee
Mock Democratic Convention

several openings available.

With a record of 12 correct
predictions in 17 attempts,
W&L’s Mock Convention stands
unequaled. In fact, since 1948,
W&L_ delegates have been
wrong only once — in 1972, when
they nominated Edward Ken-
nedy over George McGovern.
Years that have had correct
conclusions include Kennedy in
1960, Goldwater in 1964, Nixon
in 1968, Carter in 1976 and
Reagan in 1980.

Presently, the Steering Com-
mittee for the 1984 Mock Con-
vention is in full swing, working
to uphold the history of ac-
curacy. In later articles we will
be taking a look behind the
scenes of the convention-

how this accuracy is achieved

hoped, 1984 being no exception.

The application deadline for
these positions is tomorrow. Ap-

Executive Committee in the
spring of 1982.

The EC also appointed senior

junior Michael Shelton
treasurer.

The steering committee,
selected last winter after a
series of interviews is compos-

Rick De Alessandrini, East,
Michael Allen, West, and Jack
Dent, South, are the regional

Girard, Wilson shine
as Generals romp 28-/

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
Generals won their first game
of the young season last Satur-
day with a 28-7 Homecoming
victory over the Centre College
Colonels.

Tailback Gene Girard had his
best day as a collegian as he
rushed for 170 yards and two
TD’s on 17 carries. ‘“‘Gene had a
big day running the ball and
much of his success can be trac-
ed to the way our offensive line
get out and blocked their people
at the corners. I think our ex-
perience on the offensive line
began to show because the
veterans we have in that area
have begun to make adjust-
ments on the run,” stated
Fallon.

Washington and Lee got on
the scoreboard in the first
quarter when QB Bobby Wilson
hit tight end Rob Brown with a
13-yard scoring pass. On the
play, Brown made a_ spec-
tacular catch as he went up high
to wrestle the ball away from
two Colonel defenders. James
White added the PAT and W&L
led, 7-0.

“Rob Brown and Ian Banwell,

our tight ends, both had excep-
tional afternoons catching the
ball and also blocking,” said
Fallon.

Early in the second quarter,
Girard scored the first of his
two touchdowns as he ran it in
from 39 yards. White’s kick was
again good, increasing the W&L
lead to 14-0 with 11:52 remain-
ing in the first half.

The key moment in the game
came later in the quarter when
the W&L defense stopped Cen-
tre on a fourth down and one at
the two-yard line. The outcome
was never in doubt after this
goal-line stand. On the day, the
General defense forced four
Centre turnovers and was led
by end Charlie Alcorn (7 tac-
kles, 1 fumble recovery) and
tackle Mark Weaver (7 tac-
kles).

Fallon also had praise for his
secondary as they held danger-
ous Centre quarterback Mike
Hall to only 115 yards passing
and no touchdowns.

“The secondary played well
and Kelvin Newsome came up
with a key interception. Chris
Wilson stepped in back there
when Bob Jenevein went down
with a bruised shoulder and did
a fine job,” Fallon stated.

Near the outset of the second
half, Girard broke loose again
and went 62 yards for the score,
putting W&L ahead 21-0. Bobby
Wilson closed out the W&L scor-
ing for the day as he tossed his
fourth touchdown pass of the
year — a 14 yarder to Tom
Wiser. White kicked his fourth
PAT of the day and W&L led
28-0 with 10:12 remaining in the
game.

Centre posted its lone score
with 2:47 left as Meredith
Evans carried it in from one
yard out. Kelsey was good on
the PAT, making the final
score, 28-7.

W&L faces ODAC rival Ran-
dolph-Macon this Saturday at
Ashland, Va. The Generals
must win this game in order to
keep their ODAC championship
hopes alive.

Randolph-Macon is 0-3 on the
season, but Fallon is not about
to let overconfidence afflict his
troops.

‘Don’t let their record fool
you. Randolph-Macon has
played three very strong foot-
ball teams. By now they’re used
to playing difficult opposition
and they’re bound to be mighty
hungry for a win.”’

Kick-off is set for 1:30 p.m.

Soccer storms to two straight

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

The Generals upped their

record to 2-1 with a come-from-
behind victory over visiting
Mary Washington yesterday.
The General kickers defeated
the ‘Blue Tide 2-1 to claim their
second straight victory.

Senior co-captain Roland
Simon scored his third goal of
the season with 20 minutes left

 

in the game after the Blue Tide _

  

had gotten their only goal eight
minutes into the second half.
Junior midfielder Mark Sulli-
van scored the game-winner
with ten minutes left on an in-
direct free kick just inside the
Mary Washington penalty box.

ves downfield in the Generals 2-1 victory over

 

away with a 2-0 upset shutout at
Averett.

Offensively the Generals’
first two games could not have
been more similar. Senior co-
captain Roland Simon scored
first for the Generals at the 24-
minute mark from an assist by
sophomore Billy Homes. The
same combination tallied
W&L’s first goal last week, also.

And for the second week in a
row junior Jeff Reichert scored
the second General goal off of a
Randall Ray corner kick. Simon
also got an assist when he
deflected Ray’s corner kick to
Reichert who sent it home for a
2-0 General lead with 24 minutes
left.

But Averett, the top-ranked
team in the region, kept the
game “tight all the way to the
end,”’ according to Piranian. A
missed penalty kick with eight
minutes left and the play of
goalies Jay Werner (8 saves)
and Mark McDonough (2 saves)
kept Averett off the seoreboard.
McDonough replaced Werner
with 12 minutes left in the
game.

While Averett could not get on
the scoreboard, they held their
own in the statistics, leading
W&L in corner kicks, 7-6, while
the Generals held the edge in
shots taken, 17-15.

Generals is at Maryville Col-
lege on Saturday, followed by a

Coaches still see
improvement as
polo goes to /-5

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
water polo team compiled a
record of 1-3 last weekend in the
Northeast Varsity invitational
which was played at Brown
University in Providence,
Rhode Island. The Generals, 7-5
overall, defeated M.I.T., but
lost to Slippery Rock and Navy.
Navy and Brown have unde-
feated records in the tourna-
ment which will be completed
Oct. 14, 15 and 16 at the
Southeast Varsity Invitational
in Annapolis, Maryland.

Although W&L was 1-3 last
weekend, the coaches were
pleased with the team’s perfor-
mance. Assistant Coach Bob
Newcomb said, ‘‘We feel that
we got what we wanted out of
the tournament,’’ According to
Coach Newcomb, the substitu-
tion plan that W&L initiated last
weekend worked very well.

The W&L freshmen are con-
tinuing to make progress stated
Coach Newcomb. He said, ‘‘The
B team is making leaps and
bounds to some very fine water
polo.”’

The continued progress of the
freshmen combined with W&L’s

new method of substitution is
moving the Generals toward the
accomplishment of their goals.
W&L is not concerned with the
outcome of the games right
now. The Generals’ long range
goals are focused on the
Southern, Conference Cham-
pionships Coach Newcomb said,
“Everything we do is aimed at
that (the Southern Conference
Championships). We feel that
that is where we are really go-
ing to excel.”’

This weekend W&L will host
The Generals Invitational. The
tournament will be played Oct.
1 and 2 at the Cy Twombly Pool.
W&L will enter an A and a B
team. Teams from the Univer-
sity of Dayton, George Wash-
ington University, Lynchburg
College and the Northern
Virginia Aquatic Club will also
participate. The playing times
of W&L teams were not
available at press time.

Regarding the tournament,
Coach Newcomb said, ‘‘The A
team should win all of their
games this weekend.”’ He add-
ed, ‘‘This is a big weekend for
the B team. The freshmen will
pick up a lot of good ex-
perience,”’

Review ‘and Outlook

Eller’s speech

The recipe is quite simple:

Invite a well-known speaker to campus and stand
him behind the Lee Chapel podium with a Washington
and Lee grad who says he’s happy to be on that side of
the lectern.

Publicize the event widely on the undergraduate
and law school campuses as well as in the town.

Give the speaker a topical subject to discuss.

The result will be an informative, but entertaining,
evening that should appeal to a variety of students
and townspeople. And those who attended last Thurs-
day’s drug education program were not disappointed.

Warren Welsh, a W&L alumnus who is now Director
of Security for the National Football League, and Carl
Eller, a five-time all-pro defensive lineman with the
Minnesota Vikings, spoke to a receptive Lee Chapel
audience on drug abuse.

The audience was noticeably diverse. A number of
Washington and Lee athletes were on hand, as were
other students from both W&L and VMI.

The younger set were also in attendance. Apparent-
ly at the request of a local elementary school teacher,
the youngsters, particularly the boys, were enthralled
at listening to and getting the autograph of one of
their football heroes.

Eller’s talk was, as those who were there will attest,
dynamic and thought-provoking. His personal tale of
how alcohol abuse led to drug abuse and his ex-
periences along the way kept the audience attentive
— few checked their watches.

Not only has the issue of drug abuse pervaded life
here at Washington and Lee, but it also has been a
pressing issue in society as a whole, notably in the Na-
tional Football League. In those respects, the pro-
gram last Thursday was bound to attract a large au-
dience, and, indeed, it did.

The Athletic Department deserves kudos for ar-
ranging the program.

And Contact should take note.

Destroying the myths of rape
Dear Editor: sleep around at all the houses.
vie : She’s not one of those. She’s a
“He'll understand if I knock —_very decent kid who got caught
him on the head.”’

When she said that, I thought
my Lexington friend was over-
reacting to my speculation that
Police Chief L.O. Sutton
misunderstood the nature of
rape, specifically the rape of a
Randolph-Macon freshman at
the PiKA house Sept. 15.

Sutton said to The Phi, ‘“‘She’s
a hell of a decent kid. . . .She
came to a party to have a good
time and this happened to her.

“She’s not like some girls
who’ve been around for years
and make all the parties and

in a very tragic situation.”’

The more I thought about the
quote, the more I wondered if
the Chief would find it less
“tragic” if someone had raped
a woman who the Chief thought
slept around at the houses.
That’s wrong, but it still didn’t
seem grounds for knocking him
on the head.

It is only natural to think that
some girls live so licentiously
that they are ‘‘asking for it.”
It’s natural curiosity to wonder
if the rape victim ‘‘enjoyed it,”
as I heard a friend wonder. We
usually let these statements

Plus/minus system questioned

To the Editors:

I do not understand why the
new plus/minus system of
grading affects the entire stu-
dent body and not just the
freshmen. Has it not been in the
past to implement new rules to
an incoming class? For exam-
ple, the 121 credit requirement
as opposed to the old 115 hour
requirement affects only the
Classes of 86 and ’87. Why
should students who have been

able to work under one system
for two or three years have to
change in the middle of their
college careers? I think a large
number of students are con-
cerned or at least interested in
this new rule, but they feel that
the rule change is final. I hope
that more people will be able to
voice opinions about this unfair
act.

Committee set to
study calendar

To the Editors:

President Wilson has ap-
pointed an ad hoc committee to
examine the effectiveness of the
university’s undergraduate
academic calendar. This com-
mittee is beginning its delibera-
tions and is actively seeking in-
put from all members of the
university community, especi-
ally the student body. We
welcome your participation
through petitions or written
comments or by speaking with
one or more members of the
committee.

As we continue our work, we

intend to make our conclusions
public and to solicit further
comment. We hope that our
final recommendations will
represent a consensus opinion
with some solid responses to ob-
jections that may arise.
Members of the committee
are Rob Woods and Lee
Feldman from the student
body, Professors Beckley,
Cook, Jennings, Ray, Sanders,
Spencer, Stephenson, and Wise,
and Mr. Head (ex officio).
John H. Wise
Chairman

States, a central concern is the
destruction of myths about
rape. They have fought, suc-
cessfully, the idea that rape is
as much a sexual attack as ‘‘an
act of physical violence,” as
said the woman who would
thump the Chief. Which means
that a woman with a bad
reputation is NO MORE LIKE-
LY to be raped than anyone
else. Vulnerability, not ir-
resistability, attracts the
rapist.

But a worse myth is that rape
is more often the work of the
criminal psychopath than it is
“the callous violation of a
woman’s sexual rights by a
man she knows,”’ as Jean
MackKellar has written.

Dean clarifies
statement

To the Editors:

A brief word about the Sept.
15 Phi article ‘‘Orientation call-
ed ragged.’’ The statement at-
tributed to me about ‘‘too many
athletic tests’? hampering
freshmen’s meeting with their
advisers has been perceived as
a criticism of the Physical
Education Department. This
was not my intention, if indeed
they were even my words. Both
the P.E. Proficiency Tests and
the Freshmen Athlete’s Physi-
cal Examinations are univer-
sity requirements, which are
simply administered by the
Athletic Department and Infir-
mary staff respectively.

I had hoped that the tenor of
my complete statement to the
Phi would have made clear that
characterizing Orientation
Week as “‘ragged’’ was a mea
culpa judgment.

Experiment

(continued from page 5)

‘Neither one of us thought it
would be a big thing,’ Howe
noted.

‘‘Most of the people said they
thought it was not for real,”
Howe said. ‘‘Why? Maybe they
didn’t want to seem fooled by
my charade — whatever you
want to call it. Some were mad.
Some were scoffing at it.”

Howe was very insistent that
the result was not Novack’s
fault.

‘*He had no idea of how it was
going to come out,” Howe said.

‘‘We had met once or twice for
about 20 minutes.”

When Howe was asked about
his talks with Novack, he said
they had discussed what could
go wrong, and had tried to an-
ticipate possible problems.

‘“‘He was really interested in
how I would deal with telling
people about the experiment.
We hadn’t talked specifically
about ethics. We really didn’t
say how ethical it was. We ask-
ed how feasible it was,’’ Howe
explained.

The role of ‘Saviour of

ceiveable flawless situation in
which they may be kept? In the
bishops’ words:

“Do the exorbitant costs, the
general climate of insecurity
generated, the possibility of ac-
cidental detonation of highly
destructive weapons, the
danger of error and miscalcula-
tion that could provoke retalia-
tion and war — do such evils or
others attendant upon and in-
directly deriving from the arms
race make the arms race itself
a disproportionate response to
aggression?’’ Perhaps it best be
left a rhetorical question.

The question of the arms race
strikes deep into politics, into
the very definition of a nation-
state. Is the idea of a state and
nuclear arms incompatible?

“The presumption of the
nation-state system, that
sovereignty implies an ability
to protect a nation’s territory
and population, is precisely the
presumption denied by the
nuclear capacities of both
superpowers. In a sense each is
at the mercy of the other’s
perception of what strategy is
‘rational,’ what kind of damage
is ‘unacceptable,’ how ‘convinc-
ing’ one’s threat is to the
other.”

It’s a whole new ball game.
Protection is impossible: our
country is no longer capable of
defending us except through
threats. Our defense depends

upon the rationality of the
Soviets (in which we usually
place so little confidence). The
Soviets are equally dependent
on our rationality.

That no rational man could
start a nuclear war seems
clear; no conceivable reason
for doing so is thinkable. We are
not only dependent on the in-
creasingly growing nuclear
powers’ rationality, but also on
something else — a new found
flawlessness in human abili-
ties.

When this perfection was
starting to bloom in 1945, some
leaders suggested nuclear arms
would lead to an end to war.
But, ‘‘rather than eliminate the
causes of war, the arms race
serves only to aggravate the
position. As long as extravagant
sums of money are poured into
the development of new
weapons, it is impossible to
devote adequate aid in tackling
the misery which prevails at the
present day in the world.

The problem is_ indeed
spreading into more unmanage-
able sizes. Where will it be in
another ten years when ter-
rorists have the bomb? What
sort of news stories are we go-
ing to get used to? (‘‘Heard
about Detroit? Heard about
Pittsburgh, PA?” David Byrne,
“Life During Wartime’’)

We need to get serious. We
need to come to terms with
what is around us, what it can
do, and what it means. We need
to see we can no longer post-
pone the issue. At the very
least, we need to discuss it.

van will speak Tuesday, Oct. 4

Rape

(continued from page 2)
These are the rapes that are
so rarely reported, and are
propagated by the ignorance
you find at a place like, sur-

prise, Washington and Lee.
Take your average woman’s
college freshman and a typical
fraternity man. The stereotype
is accepted that he will try to
take what he can get, and that
her ‘“‘no’s” will mean ‘“‘maybe’”’
and her ‘‘maybe’s”’ will mean
‘“‘ves.’’ If she rejects him, ac-
cording to this script, he will
think she’s a bitch, and if she
gives any ground at all before
drawing the line, she’s a tease.

Add alcohol, and the stage is set
for rape by the non-stranger.
Although the enlightened
world now condemns as rape
any sex the victim does not
want, the victim of rape by an
old boyfriend or blind date at
W&L might naturally blame
herself. If she hadn’t said this or
that, if she had been firmer in
refusing him, if she hadn’t been
so gripped by fear, embarrass-
ment and disbelief that she
couldn’t fight him off or just run
out, then, maybe, it wouldn’t
have happened. MacKellar
noted that for these reasons and
others, only one in ten or one in

twenty of these rapes will be
reported.

That being so, you can see
why a woman like my friend
would strike out against any
hint of the Monster Ignorance
that heightens the chances that
she or one of her friends will be
raped.

But the battle against rape
will go unnoted at W&L until
there are more feminine voices
among the students and the
faculty to sound the alarm. And
it is not just the problem of rape
and violence against women
that we ignore. We are missing

lessons that Western Civiliza-
tion began to learn when the
coeducation process in schools
and the public forum began in
earnest fifteen years ago, leav-
ing W&L behind.

Rape is so horrible, painful
and degrading. But it feeds on
the ignorance that grows down
in us, despite our good natures,
because we must wait until age
22 and graduation to be exposed
to sunlight.

Perhaps the lessons women
can teach us cannot be put off
until then.

Ford speaks at VMI

on leadership

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

The United States should take
‘the mantle of leadership of the
free world,” former President

,Gerald R. Ford told a Cameron
Hall audience of about 5,000 last
night.

Before accepting that leader-
ship role, though, Ford said, the
U.S. must continue to pursue
“sound fiscal and monetary
policies’ and modernize and
strenghten its military forces to
obtain ‘‘a sufficient margin of
safety for our own security.”

Ford said the free nations are
beginning to look toward the
U.S. for leadership and he said
he was encouraged by a trend
away from the ‘‘anti-American-
ism’’ of the early 1960s and late
1970s.

After holding the second
World Forum in Vail, Colo., in
August, Ford said the 57 leaders
came to the consensus that ‘‘the
free world looked to and was
dependent on the United States
of America for leadership to
carry them forward to meet the
Soviet Union and the Com-
munist threat around the globe.

“Since then,’ Ford con-
tinued, ‘‘I must confess, I have
asked myself are we prepared
in this country to carry on this
role of global leadership?

“IT believe the U.S. will res-
pond to that call for leadership,
and the best evidence is the
growing economy, our improv-
ed military preparedness and
our firmness in dealing with our
global military adversary, the
Soviet Union.”

Ford decried the federal
budget deficit of $200 billion in
the fiscal year that ended Fri-
day. “For one year, this deficit
is manageable, but over the
long haul, it is totally unaccep-
table and intolerable.... It
could abort our economic pro-
gress out of the recession.”’

The government should hold
the line on domestic expen-
ditures, increase defense ex-
penditures by 5 to 6 percent and
develop some _ alternative
revenues by the fiscal year 1985,
Ford said.

“Reagan is doing the right
thing, and we’re on the right
track,’ Ford said. “But we’d
better keep a steady hand on the
tiller.”’

A Constitutional amendment
requiring a balanced federal
budget is ‘not the answer,”’
though, Ford said, and it would
be full of loopholes. ‘‘Under no
circumstances can you solve
our country’s fiscal problems
by quick fixes,’’ he added.

Professor injured in plane crash

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

Prof. Lyman R. Emmons was
listed in satisfactory condition
late Wednesday night after the
single-engine Cessna he was
piloting crashed in the nearby
town of Glasgow Sunday night.
The four passengers on board
were injured.

Emmons, a_ professor of
biology who has been with the
university since 1961, was taken
to the University of Virginia
Hospital in Charlottesville.

State Trooper W.L. Warren,
who was called to the scene on
U.S. 501 about thirty minutes
after the 5:30 p.m. crash, said
that Emmons was practicing
takeoffs and landings when the
accident occurred.

‘*He was coming in to land,”
Warren said, ‘‘and when the
wheels touched the ground,
there was something he didn’t
like, so he tried to get the craft
airborne again — make a ‘go
around.’

“He applied power to in-
crease his altitude, and when he

pulled up the left wing touched
the ground, causing the craft to
go into an embankment with a
cartwheel effect.”

Warren, who called the plane
‘a total loss,” said that he is
taking photographs and gather-
ing statistical data as part of his
investigation.

“My primary concern is if
any violations of Virginia law
were involved,” he said. ‘I’m
still looking.”

Review and Outlook
EC Kudos

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

When this year’s Executive Committee was elected
last spring, many questioned the Committee’s poten-
tial effectiveness. They had reason to be skeptical
—only two of the EC’s 10 members had prior EC ex-
perience.

Last week, the Executive Committee, under Presi-
dent Bob Jenevein, demonstrated that experience is
not necessarily a prerequisite to good government.

Budget hearings and allocations often show the
stuff of which an Executive Committee is made, and
if that is the case this year, the 1983-84 EC does indeed
have a significant amount of potential.

The EC had $108,000 in student taxes to work with
but $172,000 in requests for funds from the various stu-
dent organizations.

Complicating the matter was the fact that this was
a Mock Convention year, and the Mock Convention re-
quested over $13,000 in student taxes.

But this year’s EC was not fazed. Two significant
changes in the format of the budget hearings and
deliberations led to a more thorough review of each
organization’s request and a more comprehensive
decision-making process.

In previous years, the EC had made a decision on
each organization’s allocation immediately after the
organization had defended its request and answered
questions from the committee members. This often
led to confusion on the part of EC members, who did
not really have ample time to study each request
before casting a vote.

That problem was alleviated last week by the EC’s
not making any decisions until all organizations had
defended their requests.

When the time for those decisions rolled around
Thursday evening, the second major change became
apparent. The finance subcommittee, consisting of
vice-president Dave Judge, upperclass law represen-
tative Jim Green and senior class representative Jim
Messer, had reviewed and discussed each request
—apparently often at great length — and made a
recommendation to the EC.

It would be difficult to challenge the validity of
these recommendations because 12 of the 18 were ap-
proved by the entire committee. Debate on many of
the organizations’ requests was surprisingly brief, as
EC members had been able to review each request.

Whether the EC made the correct decisions in the
allocation of funds is a moot point. What is important
is that this year’s EC has made noticeable strides
toward simplifying what used to be a_ tedious
budgeting process.

And from that we can hope that even better things
are tocome.

Phi reporting questioned

To the Editors:

Racism lives at W&L, subtly.

Two weeks ago in the Ring-
tum Phi, there were two reports
about assaults on students. A
pair of W&L students had been
beaten up in Lexington and a
freshman from Randolph-
Macon Women’s College had
been raped at a W&L fraternity
house.

None of the suspects in the
crimes, the Phi told us, were
W&L students. In addition, all
of the assailants, it told us just
as matter of factly, were black.
Last Thursday a follow-up story
on the assault on the two W&L
students again identified the
suspects as black.

Including the suspect’s race
in the stories was unnecessary
— it accomplished nothing
other than stirring up racial
tension and reinforcing old
stereotypes.

Does the Phi make it a
regular policy to identify people
who appear in its news columns
by the color of their skin? Cer-
tainly not if they’re white. Had
the assailants been white,
would the Phi have described
them by their race? I don’t
think so.

kKkkk

The Ring-tum Phi invites
readers to submit letters to the
Editors but reserves the right
to edit letters provided the
meaning remains unchanged.
Letters to the Editors are not
the stated views of the Ring-
tum Phi or its editors but sole-
ly those of the letter’s author.

The two incidents were
vicious, inexcusable criminal
acts directed at college students
by, apparently, non-students.
The race of those involved had
nothing to do with the issue and,
unless it could have shown some
compelling reason to include
racial descriptions, the Phi
should have left them out.

Almost all newspapers make
it a policy not to identify people

by their race unless it is rele-
vant to the subject. If, for in-
stance, two black firefighters
sue the City of Roanoke for
discrimination in its promotion
practices, their race is certain-
ly relevant. But in most stories,
identification by race is not
necessary.

There was a time, not too
many years ago, when this

comes primarily from advertising and from a portion of the student activities fee. The
Publications Board elects the Chief Editors and Business Manager, but the Ring-tum Phi
is otherwise independent.

Letters to the Editor and submissions must be in the Ring-tum Phi office, room 206 of
the Student Center, by 5 p.m. Monday of the week they are to be run. This newspaper

Time for discussion

By BEN HALE

Nhen the editor discussed the
ssibility of a column with me,
iad no idea how difficult it
uld be to focus on a par-
ular topic that could benefit
least most readers. I had sug-
stions for every topic from
esident Wilson’s wardrobe to
an Atwoods’ office shower in
: C-School blueprints. I have
tled, however, on a couple of
ngs that ought to be on our
nds these days — perhaps
re strongly than they
eady are.
n last week’s Ring-tum Phi
‘re was an article on page 4
yorting Student Body Vice
asident David Judge’s im-
ssions from the Alumni
ird of directors meeting.
less Mr. Judge is dramati-
ly exaggerating the board’s
itiments, the report should
woke some serious interest
Jaction from us.
ividently the issue of
iducation is coming to a head
h the alumni; students
uld make their opinions
ywn. This is a_ heavily
cussed issue. Its importance,
vever, remains the same.
are is no issue more rooted in
marrow of W&L. We should
let the alumni make a

recommendation to the Board
of Trustee without letting the
alumni with whom we are ac-
quainted know our feelings.

In Monday’s’ Richmond
Times-Dispatch, President
Wilson is quoted as saying:

“‘T want to put the question of
coeducation to rest by May ...
one way or another. I will either
ask the Board of Trustees to ap-
prove a change or tell them that
we should remain all male at
the undergraduate level.”’

This is definite language — no
vague rumor — about the im-
mediacy of the issue. This is
serious talk about the most
serious change of all. Please

don’t discuss it as a rumbling in
OTOL

My View

the distance. President Wilson
has met with the faculty and
outlined procedures for incor-
porating student opinion. By all
means let us cooperate.
According to the Voting
Regulations Board, there will
already have been a student
referendum by the time this is
published.
It’s regretful that the Ex-
ecutive Committee felt the need

 

to rush this. It should have been
disconnected with other elec-
tions and well publicized. But if
you didn’t vote, here is more
motivation for you to speak out
in other ways.

The other point of concern
from Judge’s report was the
statement on Fraternities. If
the phrases: ‘embarrassment
to the university”? and “rock
bottom’’ accurately reflect the
Alumni board’s sentiments, we
should be stirred. The alumni
are the main channel for any
funds outside of dues.

President Wilson met with the
IFC Thursday evening and gave
a lengthy speech outlining the
already well-known pros and
cons of the fraternity system as
it is now. His speech was,
however, a way of putting the
ball in the IFC’s court. He made
it somewhat clear that he’d like
nothing better than seeing the
fraternities straighten them-
selves out. If the fraternities
analyze their own problems
(e.g. run-down structures, sag-
ging alumni relations, com-
munity relations, etc.) and take
measures to solve these pro-
blems, administrative legisla-
tion will not be necessary. We
should appreciate this oppor-
tunity and act accordingly.

 

 

Letter

(continued from page 2)

wasn’t always true in the South.
Photographs of blacks were not
used to illustrate routine news
stories and news about the
black community was
regulated to the ‘‘Negro News’’
sections. In fact, about the only
sure way for a black to get in
the newspaper was to commit a
crime against ‘‘law-abiding’’
whites. And, of course, the
criminal’s race was played up,
reinforcing prejudices and fur-
ther adding to the indignities of
living in a segregated society.

The reporters who wrote the
articles probably didn’t include
the information as intentional
racial slaps. Their actions,
however, were thoughtless ex-
amples of the subtle kinds of
prejudice that still vex blacks
long after the demise of Jim
Crow laws.

A newspaper has a respon-
sibility to print the news ac-
curately and fairly. The stories
were accurate, but biased. In
this case, irresponsibly.

and budgeting.

Witness the ‘‘Calyx,’” the
undergraduate yearbook. Last
year’s business manager
FORGOT to bill advertisers
$5,000. How one could forget
money — especially $5,000
—that was due him I’ll never
know. While the ‘‘Calyx’”’
received all but $500 of its re-
quest ($11,500), the fact re-
mains the yearbook will be
responsible this year for a stu-
dent’s carelessness with stu-
dent activity funds last year.

Then there was last year’s
business manager for the Ring-
tum Phi. Upperclassmen will
remember last year’s paper
had a full-page advertisement
on the back page for every
issue. The page, worth $165 was
sold to an advertiser for $130
provided the ad ran every issue.
At the end of the year, with a
contract signed earlier promis-
ing payment and a $1,690 debt

by the advertiser to the paper,
some think the business
manager offered a ‘‘deal’’ with
the ‘suddenly broke’’ adver-
tiser for payment of $1,120 and
no further obligations. The con-
tract was not found at the begin-
ning of this year. This was a loss
to the paper of over $500 be-
cause one student may have
been eager to leave campus.
(Additionally, the ad _ upset
other competing stores so that
future advertisements in the
paper have been hurt.)

Finally there was the Mock
Convention. They received
$10,000 in EC funds, far short of
the $13,632 they had hoped for
and only $1,500 above what had
been promised them last year.
The Convention’s budget man
cried the blues about low cash
flows and great expenses. His
cries fell on deaf ears, and
rightfully so. The cash flow pro-
blems stem from a misunder-

standing about a bond’s due
date (somehow $6,000 will not
be available for spending until
nearly four months after the
Convention) and the Conven-
tion’s Finance Committee’s in-
ability to raise funds from cor-
porate sponsors by the assigned
time.

In fact the Finance Committee
met only once last spring.

Cry, weep and gnash their
teeth as they may, each of these
groups is shedding bitter tears.
It is not the responsibility of the
EC to pay for students’ mis-
takes, carelessness, or follies.
The EC does not appropriate
student funds -—parents’
money, in most cases — for fun
and frivolity. Rather, funds are
given organizations with the ex-
pectation that they will be
handled and spent judiciously.
Begging for more money when
past spending habits show
carelessness is begging in vain.

Kennedy speaks to
conservative crowd

at Liberty Baptist

By TODD SMITH
Staff Reporter

Introduced to a gym full of
conservative Liberty Baptist
College students as ‘Mr.
Democrat and Mr. Liberal,”
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D.-
Mass.) made a _ relatively
painless trip through the lion’s
den Monday night.

Despite the controversial
mix-up that brought him as a
speaker to the college founded
by Moral Majority leader, the
Rev. Jerry Falwell, Kennedy’s
speech on religious toleration in
politics received a polite stand-

screened questions from stu-
dents and none from the large
group of Washington and
regional reporters, as both he
and Falwell sought to avoid a
repeat of the jeering that
Falwell received when speak-
ing earlier this year at Harvard
University.

On the contrary, the mood
was congenial. After breaking
bread with Kennedy, Falwell
said, ‘We'll probably like each
other better now.’”’ And Ken-
nedy began his speech joking
that he had arranged with
Falwell ‘to permit all the

students an extra hour next
Saturday night before curfew.
And, in return, I have promised
to watch the Old Time Gospel
Hour next Sunday night.”

Kennedy, a Roman Catholic,
spoke for the separation of
church and state, and cautioned
women and men “of deep
religious faith’ against the
temptation “to misuse govern-
ment in order to impose a value
which they cannot persuade
others to accept.

“Once we succumb to that
temptation, we step onto a slip-
pery slope where everyone’s
freedom is at risk,’’ Kennedy
said. ‘‘Those who favor censor-
ship should recall that one of the
first books ever burned was the
first English translation of the
Bible.

“T respectfully suggest that
God has taken no position on the
Department of Education —and
that a balanced budget constitu-
tional amendment is a matter
for economic analysis, not
heavenly appeals,” Kennedy
said.

But aside from these barbs
pointed at the conservative
Moral Majority, Kennedy
quoted the apostle Paul and ap-
pealed to his critics: ‘‘As fellow
citizens, let us live peaceably
with each other.”

“Dr. Falwell is not a ‘war-
monger’ — and ‘liberal
clergymen’ are not, as the
Moral Majority suggested in a
recent letter, equivalent to
‘Soviet sympathizers’.”’

It is because Kennedy has
signed onto conservative mail-
ing lists, and receives letters
like the one referred to that he
received a plastic Moral Ma-
jority membership card.

“The long and the short of it
was, a letter went to the senator
saying, why don’t you come
down and speak to us, and just
that quickly — and not a sur-
prise as I heard on ABC last
night — he accepted,” Falwell
said Monday.

A Falwell aide, however, said
that he invited Kennedy only as
an afterthought in a_ light
apology for sending Kennedy a
membership card. When Ken-
nedy accepted, the aide told the
New York Times, Falwell turn-
ed white as a sheet and said,
‘What?’ ”

Although the campus chapter
of the Young Americans for
Freedom reportedly distributed
pamphlets with Kennedy’s
voting record on_ abortion,
homosexual rights and the
nuclear freeze, there were no
signs of student dissent Monday
night.

Kennedy took questions about

his views on the Democratic

nomination for President and
nuclear arms from a_ pre-
selected, neatly dressed group
of politics majors — five men
first, then three women.

Sharolyn Schrodt, a Liberty
Baptist junior said she heard
some ‘‘people who were
swayed” by Kennedy ‘“‘being in-
terviewed saying, ‘yeah, he was
all right, he quoted Scrip-
ture.’ ”’

“‘We’re glad he came to speak
here, but he didn’t say
anything.”’ she said.

EC chops $64,00C

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

“If we’re going to have to cut
your budget, where should we
cut?” Executive Committee
President Bob Jenevein asked
Ron Magee, president of the
Student Association for Black
Unity, at last week’s budget
hearings.

‘‘Whew...”’ responded Magee,
echoing the response of many of
the other 15 organizations who’d
requested money from the EC.

When it was all over at 11:30
Thursday night, the EC had
pared budget requests of over
$172,000 down to $108,961.77

Two organizations, Excelsior
and the Outdoor Club, did not
receive any money. Excelsior
had requested $900 to publish
three four-page issues, while
the Outdoor Club had agreed
previously to be incorporated
into the Student Activities
Board.

Only two organizations, the
Hockey Club and the Ariel, had
their requests granted. Every
other organization had its re-
questreduced. _

This year’s hearings were
marked by two format changes.
First, deliberations were held
after all clubs had defended
their requests. And in a move
that sped up the process some-
what, all requests were review-
ed by a finance subcommittee,
consisting of Vice-President
Dave Judge, law rep Jim Green
and senior rep Jim Messer.

The finance committee re-
viewed each budget and made a
recommendation to the EC as to
how much money each
organization should receive.
For 12 of the 19 requests
(including EC expenses and EC
funding), the finance subcom-
mittee’s recommendation was
approved by the EC, often
unanimously and frequently
with little debate.

On four occasions, the EC
raised the finance subcom-
mittee’s recommendation, and
twice that recommendation was
reduced.

Following is a breakdown of
the organizations’ requests to
the EC and the points around
which debate centered. The
organizations are listed accord-
ing to how much money each
received.

e¢ Student Activities Board.
The SAB requested $61,288 in
what Jenevein described ‘‘an
impressive request.’’ Most of
that money, $36,612, would have
been spent on entertainment,
with the University Center
Committee taking up $17,693.
The finance subcommittee
recommended the SAB receive
$42,000, which was approved
unanimously by the EC. “‘It
almost feels like we’re penaliz-
ing you for doing such a good
job last year,” Judge said.

¢ Student Bar Association.
The SBA’s request of $25,540
represented 102 percent of the

law school’s contribution to s
dent taxes. Last year’s S)
received 72 percent of that c:
tribution. The finance subco
mittee recommended that |
SBA receive 80 percent,

$17,907. Law rep Jim Green p
posed that the amount be rais
to 82 percent, or $18,354.67,
amount approved unanimou
by the EC. Also, the SB:
money will be channeled ii
six accounts, each representi
a different aspect of the Si

¢ Ring-tum Phi. The Phi’s
quest of $13,469 included $56
pay a student to deliver
papers. “It’s an experim
that hasn’t been done in fi
years, and I think it’s worth i
business manager Tom O’Br
said.
_ The finance subcommitte
recommendation of $12,750 v
increased to $13,000 by the
on a unanimous vote.

subcommittee recommen
$10,500. Business mana;
Dave Killenbeck said th

Killenbeck called the estima
$2,000 in advertising reven
‘pretty optimistic.”” The EC
creased the subcommitte
recommendation to $11,000 b
9-1 vote.

¢ Mock Convention. 1
Board of Trustees decided |
year that the Mock Convent
should receive $5 per stud
from the student taxes, total
$8,312.90. In addition the c
vention requested $5,319
from the EC. Administrai
assistant Lee Feldman s:
“The inital fund-raising dr

n 15 budget requests

Feldman also cited a poten-
tial problem with cash flow and
a later availability of bonds
than expected as other reasons
for the Convention’s request.

The finance subcommittee
recommended $10,000, or
$1,687.10 over what the Board of
Trustees had mandated. That
amount was approved unani-
mously by the EC, with Jene-
vein saying, ‘“‘We’re without
alternatives. We don’t have
unlimited funds.”’

tion of the Interfraternity Coun-
cil, Contact is now funded by
both the EC and the IFC. They
requested $13,000 from the EC
to go with $8,000 from the IFC to
sponsor six speakers. ‘‘We’re
facing a big problem this year
in that speaker prices have just
gone through the wall,’’ Gov
Slahor said.

“Why the decision to hit the
EC for 13 [thousand dollars]
and the IFC for only eight?”
asked Secretary Len Howard.
“Is it really fair for the EC to
foot the larger portion of the
bill?”

Sophomore rep James White
said, ‘‘The IFC obviously isn’t
taking a whole lot of respon-
sibility here in funding it.”’

The finance subcommittee’s
recommendation of $9,400 pass-
ed 91, with Howard voting
against. Howard said the EC
should give Contact that much
only if the IFC agreed to match
it.

eAriel. “‘Of all the requests
we’ve seen, I think the Ariel is
the most bare-bones request,”
Howard said. Editor Rick
Swagler’s request for $1,800 to
publish two issues was approv-
ed by the EC, even though the
finance subcommittee’s recom-
mendation had been $1,200.

e Student Association for
Black Unity. SABU’s $5,100 re-
quest included $3,000 for two
speakers. ‘‘We couldn’t really

 

¢ Contact. Originally a crea-

see a place for that,’’ Judge
said. His subcommittee’s rec-
ommendation of $1,500 was ap-
proved unanimously.

e Film Society. The Film
Society had requested $3,000 in
order to show 12 films this year,
instead of the usual eight. That
request was denied by the EC,
though, which, at the recom-
mendation of the finance sub-
committee, gave the Film
Society $1,200 on an 8-2 vote.

¢ International CLub. The In-
ternational Club received the

‘same amount as they did last

year, $1,050, which was also the
finance subcommittee’s recom-

* mendation. During the hear-

ings, vice-president Nelson Pat-
terson questioned how many
students would be willing to pay
dues to the club but said about
60 attended the club’s first

~ meeting of the year.

¢ Fencing Club. ‘We have
some really dedicated people
and they need your support,”

+ Dr. James Worth told the EC in

requesting $1,200. The athletic
department had turned down
the club’s request for varsity

~ status because of a lack of

money. The EC gave the club

~ $1,000, as per the finance sub-

committee’s recommendation.
“They’re really pushing to try
to make that an NCAA sport

and we’d hate to see them fall
apart,’’ Judge said.

e Political Review. The
Political Review, which has

gained membership in the Pub-

lications Board for a trial

~ period of three months, asked

for $1,800 to produce two issues.
When the finance subcom-
mittee’s recommendation of
$1,000 was announced, Editor
Mike Singer said he only needed
$850 to put out one issue and
asked for the EC’s promise that
if the first issue were good, a se-
cond issue be funded.

“That shows a very selfless
interest in the student body, and
we appreciate that and will
keep it in mind,’’ Jenevein said.
The $850 was approved unani-
mously.

eRugby Club. About 30-35
students participate in this
club, Herb Funsten said, and
each pays $15 in dues as well as

paying their own traveling ex-
penses and buying their own
uniforms. The club’s request of
$880 included $490 for member-
ship in the Virginia Rugby
Union, a 300 percent increase in
those dues since last year. The
finance subcommittee’s recom-
mendation of $830 was approved
unanimously.

¢ Hockey Club. With less than
a minute of debate, the EC ap-
proved the Hockey Club’s $390
request. Each member of the
club msut pay $25 in dues, and
the biggest expense is ice time
at $65 an hour.

e Frisbee Club. The Frisbee
Club’s $535 request included
money for the purchase of 30
frisbees, transportation and
tournament fees. The finance
subcommittee recommended
$265, with Judge saying, ‘“Some
people have raised questions
that in the Frisbee Club, the in-
dividual members put in very
little.” The EC cut the request
even further to $100, an amount
approved by the slimmest
margin, 6-4, of the evening.

e Excelsior. Excelsior was
formed with the idea that a
symposium would be held every
four years on a pressing na-
tional or international topic.
Chris Fulton, editor, told the
EC, “basically, we’re bagging
the symposium and the White
Paper.”’

Excelsior proposed to publish
three four-page issues as in-
serts to the Ring-tum Phi at a
cost of $900. ‘“‘My problem,”
said Jenevein, “‘is that I’m not
sure that there is some interest
in Excelsior.”

Chairman Steve Keros,
defending the publication, said,
“It’s the ‘intellectual journal’ of
the school. This is a college-
university, and there’s almost
nothing like it.”

The EC decided unanimously
to put Excelsior ‘‘in a state of
financial hold mainly due to a
lack of funds.’’

¢ Outing Club. The Outing
Club has been disbanded, and
the Student Activities Board
will oversee distribution and
maintenance of the equipment.

The EC will take a final vote
on the budget at 7 tonight.

Grads return for seminar

The Washington and Lee
University placement office
will present a panel discussion
titled ‘‘The World of Work”’ on
Wednesday, Oct. 12, featuring
three W&L graduates from the
field of commercial banking.

The panel will initiate a series
of six discussion seminars on
varying professional areas, ac-
cording to Michael A. Cappeto,
associate dean of students and
director of placement at W&L.

Cappeto, who has planned the
seminars in conjunction with
Stephen P. Bredin, W&L place-
ment consultant, said the series
reflects a more aggressive
policy of seeking placement for
W&L students.

“T think there is a need to
establish a program like this,”’
Cappetto said.

He added that when he made
a request for a placement con-
sultant last spring, university
administrators and faculty
‘wholeheartedly approved.”

Bredin, former director of
placement for the University of
Virginia business school, will
work with Cappeto in an effort
to increase the number of re-
cruiters 4t W&L as well as the
involvement of corporations on
the W&L campus.

Bredin said he will strive to
achieve the ‘“‘total involve-
ment” of large companies and
corporations in the areas of

development, research and en-
dowment.

Bredin added that the pro-
gram was also designed to raise
liberal arts students’ awareness
to the availability of jobs in
business.

“The idea, in effect, is to say
to students that the world of
business and government is
fun,’’ Bredin said, ‘‘because it
uses all sorts of skills.”’

“TI guess what I’m trying to
say is that you don’t have to
have five courses in accounting
to get into banking,”’ he said.

‘‘You hear all this about the
poor liberal arts gradu-
ate...well, that ain’t so,”’ Bredin
explained.

The seminar on banking will
presnt James Matthews, (W&L
70) +~vice-president, Private
Banking and Investment Divi-
sion, Citibank, New York City,
N.Y.;Robert Brookby, (W&L
72) +~+vice-president National
Banking, Wachovia Bank and
Trust Company, Winston-
Salem, N.C.; Frank Brower,
(W&L ’82) Management
associate, Morgan Guaranty
Trust Company, New York Ci-
ty, N.Y.

Other seminars will include
investment banking, govern-
ment services, marketing and
advertising, manufacturing and
high technology, Bredin said.

Generals sting Yellow Jack

Oe ee 7 mre

Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee quarter-
back Bobby Wilson scored on a
three-yard run with :59 remain-
ing in the game to give the
Generals a hard earned, crucial
28-21 victory over the Randolph-
Macon Yellow Jackets last
Saturday.

Wilson’s run capped off a 13-
play, 78 yard drive that began
after R-MC had tied the score at
21-21 with 6:53 to play.

Head coach Gary Fallon ex-
pected, and got, a tough game
from the Yellow Jackets.

“We weren’t surprised by
what we found down at Ran-
dolph-Macon. We had expected
to find a winless football team
that would be very hungry for
its first win. That’s exactly
what we found,” Fallon said.

Washington and Lee jumped
to an early lead when tailback
Gene Girard dove in the end
zone from one yard out. James
White converted the first of his
four PAT’s on the day and W&L
led 7-0 with five minutes re-
maining in the first quarter.

Randolph-Macon retaliated
with a pair of second quarter
scores, a 33-yard run by Alan

Wright and a one-yard plunge
by Andrew Tate, giving the
Yellow Jackets a 14-7 lead. This
lead soon vanished as QB
Wilson hit split end Dave
Sizemore for a_ four-yard
touchdown pass just 17 seconds
before intermission. After
White’s kick, the score was tied.
But the Generals had momen-
tum on their side going into the
locker room at the half.

The Generals regained the
lead midway through the third
quarter when Gene Girard’s
fumble was recovered in the
endzone by offensive tackle Pat
O’Connell. W&L held this 21-14
lead until R-MC’s Andrew Tate
scored his second touchdown of
the day on a one-yard run. Cody
Dearing added the point after,
making the score 21-21 with 6:53
remaining in the game.

Wilson then took control as he
led the Generals down the field,
completing several key third
down passes to keep the drive
alive. Wilson scored the win-
ning touchdown on a three-yard
run, making the final score,
28-21.

Coach Fallon once again had
praise for Wilson’s play.

“Bobby continues to improve
as we go along,” Fallon stated.

‘‘What I like is that he has not
been rattled. Even though he
threw two interceptions at
Macon, he didn’t let those
bother him.”

Defensively, Fallon singled
out free safety Chris Wilson.
Wilson, a sophomore from Sal-
isbury, Md., is filling in for in-
jured Bob Jenevein. Fallon add-
ed that he ‘‘continues to be im-
pressed with our defensive
secondary. They’ve played
tough football all year.”’

The Generals (2-1, 1-1 ODAC)
entertain the Maryville College
Scots (1-2, 1-2 ODAC) at Wilson
Field this Saturday. According
to Fallon, the Scots are ‘‘some-
thing of an unknown for us be-
cause this is the first year for
their coach (Bobby Saylor).
When you put a new personality
into a situation, you don’t really
have a feel for a team. We do
expect Maryville to be very
disciplined and to be a sound
team fundamentally.”’

Fallon also talked of the com-
placency his team must avoid.
‘‘We cannot rest on last week’s
laurels,” he warned. ‘‘If we do
that, Maryville could run us
right into the ground.”’

last Wednesday’s 2-1 victory
over Mary Washington.

Yesterday’s loss put the
Generals out of the race for the
Virginia Intercollegiate Soccer
Association title, according to
head coach Rolf Piranian. Of
the title race in the ODAC, Pira-
nian said, ‘‘We’re not out of it,
but (this loss) certainly didn’t
help.’”’ The Generals are 0-2 in
VISA, 1-2 in the ODAC, and 3-2
overall.

The Generals appeared to
take the lead over Roanoke 27
minutes into the game when
junior Mark Sullivan headed in
a Gary Clements free kick from
the right side, but it was
disallowed by the referee, leav-
ing the first half scoreless.

Sullivan had to wait until the
second half to get his second
goal of the season, but by then
the Maroons were up, 2-0, add-
ing another near the end of the
game for the 3-1 final score.

On Saturday the Generals
traveled to Maryville, Tenn.,
and came away with their se-
cond shutout of the season, a 2-0
victory over ODAC opponent
Maryville College.

Piranian descirbed the game
as ‘‘totally dominated by us.’’
W&L out shot Maryville, 40-3.

The first goal came three
minutes into the game when a
penalty kick of Roland Simon
rebounded to sophomore for-
ward Steve McGrath, who pun-
ched it home for a 1-0 lead.

The Generals kept up the at-
tack but could not score the rest
of the half. “‘They were a very
physical team, and that took us
out of our game plan a little,”
Piranian commented.

The constant pressure paid
off twenty minutes into the se-
cond half when junior Gary
Clements scored the Generals’
second goal.

General goalkeeper Jay
Werner recorded his second
shutout of the season against
Maryville, collecting three
saves and Player of the Game
honors.

Polo, Killer Bs win big

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee var-
sity water polo team went
undefeated (3-0) last weekend
to win the W&L Generals Invita-
tional water polo tournament.
The tournament was played at
the Cy Twombly Pool. The three
victories stretched the
Generals’ overall record to 10-5.

Head water polo coach Page
Remillard stated, “The high-
light of the weekend was that
the A team, as a unit, started to
develop an offensive and defen-
sive rhythm.” He continued, ‘‘I
am very happy about this
weekend. Everything is star-
ting to fall together.”’

The B team also had a suc-
cessful weekend. The en-
thusiasm displayed by the B
team has earned them the
nickname “Killer Bs.” The
“Killer Bs” picked up their first
win of the season when they
defeated George Washington
University by a score of 9-8. Jay
Re Ville scored the winning goal
for the Generals with seven
seconds remaining in the game.
Commenting on the B team’s
performance, Remillard said,
‘“‘We’re maturing right on time.
We're getting ready.”

Coach Remillard believes
that all of his players are play-
ing well. He cited Bobby Pear-

son and Don Smith for outstand-
ing individual performances on
the A team. He also commend-
ed David Lewis for outstanding
play as a member of the B
team.

Remillard mentioned that all
four of his goalies have improv-
ed more quickly than he thought
that they could have improved
at the beginning of the season.
He believes that the leadership
of senior goalie Kevin Kadesky
has produced this improve-
ment.

Concerning the entire team’s
progress, Remillard stated,
‘“‘All season our improvement
has been depending on the im-
provement of the freshmen. If
we beat Richmond at the
Southern League Champion-
ships it will be the result of the
B team’s improvement.’’
Remillard believes that the B
team needs to follow up last

weekend’s success with more
successful play this weekend.
“‘We need the same results this
weekend,’’ he said.

The Generals will host the
Southern League (Zone I) Tour-
nament this weekend on Oct. 8
and 9. Teams from James
Madison University, George
Washington University, Lynch-
burg College and VMI will par-
ticipate in the tournament.
W&L will enter a B team in ad-
dition to the varsity squad. The
teams will compete at the Cy
Twombly Pool.

Remillard will work on
generating offense and han-
dling special situations this
week in preparation for the
tournament. Regarding the
tournament, Remillard said,
‘We don’t know what JMU has,
but we will be ready. I hope that
we repeat our performance
from last week.”

Remember,
sports are only games

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

..If you’ve ever gotten up
early on a Saturday morning
(Yeah, I love pretend games,
too) and taken a walk over by
the law school field, you might
be able to catch a glimpse of
what athletic competition was
originally intended to be. It’s
some sort of community youth
soccer league whose _par-
ticipants are a half century
away from worrying about
retirement benefits. Indeed,
they are relative light years
away from worrying about
anything other than whether to
wear their blue or their white
wristbands. Why so much in-
terest in little league soccer?
Perhaps, these youngsters
reminded me of what sports
should be, namely games for
games’ sake. Not a startling
revelation, you say? Maybe so,

Rush 1983

Wilson concerned about fraternities

Cites problems with Rush

By PETER WRIGHT
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee Presi-
dent John D. Wilson expressed
his concern about fraternity life
at the university to the Inter-
fraternity Council and over 50
other W&L students last Thurs-
day night.

President Wilson emphasized
five problems with fraternities
at W&L.

These problems included the
bad physical welfare of houses,
security for ‘open parties,”’
lack of leaders living in the
house, a social calendar that in-
trudes on academics, and a
Rush system that is in Wilson’s
words “unsatisfactory.”’

“‘You’ve inherited a social
structure and a physical struc-
ture that were made for a dif-
ferent time,” Wilson explained
to the students. Wilson added
that the ‘‘(fraternity) house is
in fact, a small party pavilion.”’

With numerous complaints
from the Lexington community
concerning noise and _ trash,
Wilson said, ‘‘all of us should be
more cordial to our neighbors.”’

Although Wilson described
the “‘open party’’ atmosphere at
W&L as “‘the most refreshing

part of fraternity life,” pro-
blems with security are evi-
dent. Considering the recent
problems with rape and as-
saults near fraternities, Wilson
said that he simply did not know
what to do. His only suggestion
was to “close down the open
parties just a little bit.’’

Wilson also said that feelings

in the fraternity houses. “It
doesn’t make sense for a frater-

nity to be abandoned’’ of its
“leadership element.”
Wilson added that the current

condition of the fraternity
houses at W&L serve to deter
students from living in the
houses for more than a year.

You’ve inherited a social structure

and a physical structure that were

made for a different time.

among the faculty at W&L are
“not positive” in regard to
Wednesday night parties. ‘“You
can and should take a look at
how you run your social calen-
dars so that there won’t be such
a transparent intrusion,’’
Wilson told the audience. ‘‘Let
the academics...have a fighting

chance.”
Wilson also objectec to the

fraternity system’s pattern of
having mostly sophomores live

Wilson said if the houses could
become ‘‘physically strong’’
once again, students could, in
turn, restore the fraternities to
the extent that one wouldn’t
mind living in one for two or
three years.

In regard to Rush, ‘“‘a serious
problem’’ according to Wilson,
many items were discussed at
the meeting.

“It’s a lousy orientation for
the freshmen,” Wilson stated.
Although Wilson did admit that
he was not very familiar with
the Rush system at W&L, he
suggested that fraternities
should give freshmen the oppor-
tunity to become more familiar
with each of the houses on cam-
pus and also with the academics
at the school.

Wilson said fraternities are
“running at odds in having
Rush in a concentrated format

that runs right into the first four
weeks of academics.”

The president also described
Rush as being deceptive to
freshmen. With many fraterni-
ty Rush parties providing the -
freshmen with such enticing
items as oysters, live bands and
girls’ Wilson said fraternities
are competing for these “‘in-
nocents’”’ on false grounds.
“Find out what they’re like.
Find out their values,’ Wilson
suggested.

School might intervene

Frats said to need social guidance

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

The chairman of the Alumni
Board of Directors’ Committee
on Fraternity Affairs, the board
which has called for a review of
fraternities at Washington and
Lee, said in an interview Tues-
day that the committee mem-
bers got the impression that the
fraternities at Washington and
Lee University want more
university guidance of social
activities.

‘“‘We agreed that the universi-
ty has got to step in and
establish social guidelines,”’
said William C. Norman Jr.

The 10-member committee
met with fraternity officers on
Sept. 22.

“I want to emphasize that we
believe that a reasonable solu-
tion can be worked out that
would involve alumni participa-
tion,’’ Norman said.

Norman said that the com-
mittee was not anti-fraternity.
All the members of the commit-
tee had been fraternity mem-
bers when they attended
Washington and Lee, Norman
added.

Buddy Atkins, associate
alumni secretary, echoed Nor-
man’s statement. The impres-
sion the committee that met
with the students got was that

the students want more help
and guidance from the universi-
ty, Atkins said.

Atkins said that the alumni
had decided that the frater-
nities “had hit rock bottom’’
about five years ago. The alum-
ni believe that the situation had
improved recently, but they
want the improvement to con-
tinue, Atkins said.

Norman said the fraternities
have done a better job of clean-
ing up the paper cups that
usually litter the fraternity
grounds after a party. Lex-
ington citizens had complained
to alumni officials in 1982 about
the paper cup situation Norman
said.

The physical condition of
many of the fraternity houses
has not gotten any better
though, Norman said. Norman
said that the committee has
been looking into ways to im-
prove conditions.

“Of course, we would not ex-
pect a student who will be here
for only four years to take on a
major renovation project with-
out some alumni support,” said
Norman.

The committee and the fra-
ternity officers also concurred
that fraternities that are
located in residential areas
should be more aware of the
fact that they have neighbors,
Norman said. Norman added
that the fraternity officers said
they would pay more attention
to their neighbors’ rights.

Norman said that the com-
mittee members also believe

that. the fraternity officers
should live in the houses in
order to provide more supervi-
sion to the social life.

Both the fraternity officers
and the committee members
agreed that faculty advisors to
the fraternities should play a
more active role in the frater-
nities’ affairs, Norman said. In
the past, not all faculty advisors
had been active, he said.

Norman said that Rush was
also discuss at the meeting, but
no consensus on the matter was
reached.

There was a consensus that a
pavilion on the back campus for
social activities would be
desirable if the legal and finan-
cial problems associated with
such a project could be worked
out, Norman said. A pavilion
might ease the strain on the
fraternities to host midweek
parties, he said.

“We were extremely im-
pressed with the maturity of the
gentlemen who met with us,”
said Norman. ‘‘They showed a
high degree of responsibility
and great concern for the pro-
blem.”’

Staff Reporter

Last month’s fraternity Rush
was successful from the per-
spective of the Lexington Police
Department, and Chief
Lawrence QO. Sutton said he’d
“like to thank the students for
their cooperation.”

Law enforcement officials
were primarily interested in
matters related to alcohol,
house security, and amplified
sound.

Sutton said he was pleased
with the students’ performance
based on ‘‘comments from
townspeople, on comments that
I received from officers who’ve
been through this before, and on
the complaints I remember
from when I first came here in
May.”’

The chief said that no arrests
were made during Rush for
violations of the new Virginia
law which makes drinking il-
legal for those under the age of
19.

“T’m not aware of any pro-
blems along that line,” Sutton
said. “I feel certain that 18-
year-olds are drinking, but it is
being controlled and protected
by the fraternities.

“I would certainly be naive if
I thought I could prevent every
18-year-old from drinking if
they want to,”’ he said.

‘“‘A success though, is when
you prevent it from becoming a
problem to them or to us. The
credit for that success goes to
the fraternities.”

Wilson raises valid questions

By JOHN CLEGHORN
Chief Editor

“We shouldn’t fight on this.”’

So said Washington and Lee
President John Wilson at a
meeting with the Interfraterni-
ty Council and assorted frater-
nity members last week. While
President Wilson expressed his
wish to avoid a fight with frater-
nity members, it became ap-
parent at the meeting Thursday
that he already had one on his
hands.

At the IFC meeting, Presi-
dent Wilson expressed the need
for examination of several
areas of fraternity life.
Dilapidated houses, a hectic fall
Rush schedule, lengthy and
academically taxing Wednes-
day night parties, fraternity
security and _ total-sophomore
occupancy were the main areas
requiring examination, Presi-
dent Wilson said.

Wilson spoke in his character-
istically calm and articulate
manner at the meeting, explain-
ing that, as a new president to
the university, it is his duty to
raise these issues for scrutiny
and not to impose rash,
undeliberated changes on the 17
fraternities on campus.

 

and cooperation” as the factors
that resulted in positive rela-
tions between the houses and
the police.

"Chief L.O. Sutton

“I think we have accomplish-
ed a lot more through the means
of cooperation than would have
been accomplished through
confrontation,” he said.

The chief said, however, that
he would not have hesitated to
take action if circumstances
had warranted it.

“If I had perceived a serious
problem,”’ he said, ‘“‘I would not
have waited for the ABC. I
would have used my own under-
cover methods.”’

A rape and assault at a frater-
nity house midway through
Rush focused campus-wide at-
tention on the need for increas-
ed security at parties.

But before he had finished
speaking and answering ques-
tions, Wilson had been pushed
to the wall on several issues by
students who felt strongly about
their fraternity and the system
as a whole.

News
Analysis

TREE IE RENE OE TOTAL ETLIN NT TIEN TO
While it is a touchy question

and one that is defended
fervently by many who enjoy
the benefits of fraternity life,
President Wilson must be allow-
ed the opportunity to simply
raise the questions. And, in
turn, the fraternities must give
ample time and study to the
questions which affect 800 men
at Washington and Lee.

Throughout the spring of 1983
and through the early weeks of
this school year, rumors have
been floating about our new
president concerning coeduca-
tion and now, fraternities.

What does he know about
W&L? students asked. This is
not Virginia Tech, who does he
think he is?

ticular problem (security) had

not arisen,’’ Sutton said, ‘‘and I

was not aware it was a problem.

“T will be the first to admit
that I probably should have dis-

cussed it. But not having surfac-
ed as a problem, it did have a

lower priority.”

The chief said that ‘like
many things, social problems
are not recognized as problems
until they surface and the pro-
blem is created.”’

House presidents had “‘a very
good response”’ to his sugges-
tions for tightening security
following the crime, Sutton
said.

“There was an awareness
and concern that had not been
evident before...The frater-
nities deserve the credit for
making my views known and
then implementing them.”’

Sutton said that the recom-
mendations he made ‘‘were
geared strictly for this com-
munity on a_ cost-effective
basis.”

For example, he did not sug-
gest the hiring of security
guards, because ‘‘students
know how to recognize each
other better than a security
guard could.”

Officer Steven E. Crowder
walked around out of uniform to
nearly all the fraternities the
Wednesday night following the
rape to assure himself that
“security was in fact going to be
enforced, and was going to

™, (continued on page 4)

No, this is not Virginia Tech.
And it had not become apparent
yet that President Wilson is
seeking to conform W&L to his
ideas of what a university
should be.

Instead, he recognizes W&L
for the unique and traditional
school it is. What President
Wilson does offer the university
is a new, fresh viewpoint which
can serve as an impetus for im-
provement.

Each of the issues President
Wilson has raised is an ar-
guably valid point. The fra-
ternity system can hardly say it
is not worthy of some im-
provement. And obviously the
fraternities will not be willing to
accede to President Wilson
each of his terms of change ver-
batim. The key for this to be a
beneficial review for both the
fraternities and the administra-
tion lies in the ability of the two
to find a middle ground.

No, as President Wilson said,
‘“‘We shouldn’t fight on this.”’

‘I’m here to invite you to help
us solve (these problems),”’
President Wilson said last
week, ‘‘because it’s of interest
tous all.’”’

  

The question of whether or
not a smaller percentage of
Washington and Lee freshmen
participating in Fraternity
Rush has resulted in a fewer
number of freshmen pledges
has not yet been determined,
according to Dan Murphy,
Associate Dean of Students in
charge of Fraternity Affairs.

“I don’t know if the actual
number of people who pledged
fraternities is up or down,”’ said
Murphy, whose office is cur-
rently processing the Inter-
fraternity Council preference
cards and should have statistics
sometime this week.

M''rphy said that 325
students, including about 20
transfer students and
sophomores, went through
Rush. The 305 freshmen who did
go through account for just
under 85 percent of the entering
class, compared with the nor-
mal 95 percent of the past few
years, although Dean Murphy is
quick to point out that these are
“not hard and fast statistics.”’

Last year, 352 people went
through Rush, and the incoming
class size was 363. IFC Presi-
dent Emery Ellinger said he
feels the questions of numbers
and percentages has been over-
worked. ‘‘Rush orientation was
a lot better than it has been in
the past,’’ Ellinger said who
also noted that while there is
always some confusion during
Rush, this year’s freshmen

and more aware of what was go-
ing on.

As usual, there were some
mixed reactions to Rush. If
houses do want to _ boost
membership with a Spring
Rush, “...it’s up to the in-
dividual fraternities,’ said
Dean John, and for the future,
“President Wilson is stressing
the investigation of deferred
(second semester) rush.”’

Reaction to this idea is mixed.
Some freshmen, such as in-
dependent Andrew Tartaglione
thought that Fall Rush was con-
fusing, yet at the same time
said, “It’s a good way to meet
people. I think they should keep

“Financially, frats can’t hold
out on a second semester rush,”’
Ellinger said. ‘Obviously you
may want a little more time,
but by the time you get to col-
lege, you should be able to make
a decision concerning the peo-
ple you want to hang around
with.”’

Some freshmen said they con-
sider the financial aspect of
fraternities a burden. Ron
Curry, for example, has receiv-
ed a bid at Zeta Beta Tau, and
would like to pledge. “It
depends on money,” Curry
said.

Mike Weisbrock said he did
not go through Rush to save
money and because he has a
general disinterest in frater-
nities.

Crowder, who was off duty at
the time but had the chief’s per-
mission for his mission, said he
was ‘“‘very impressed’ and
‘‘well-satisfied’’ by what he saw
at the houses.

“Tl had really good coopera-
tion and very positive results
from the students,’ he said.

At all of the houses but one,
Crowder was approached and
asked for his identity upon ar-
rival.

“At one house, though, I could
have gone in and picked up
anything and walked off with
it,”’ the officer said.

Security problems at that
fraternity have since been
“resolved” according to Sutton.

Another concern of the police
department was fraternities’
use of their ‘“‘amplified sound’’
permits.

“There is no such thing as a
‘noise permit,’”’ the chief
pointed out.

Sutton said that ‘‘overall,”’
the use of fraternity stereo
privileges has been “‘very good.

“There have been a few cases
of abuse that have resulted in
warnings, but no summonses
have been written.”

“Some of the fraternities are
getting careless, though.’’ the
chief said, ‘“‘because they are
applying for the amplified
sound permit and then not
bothering to pick it up.

“If they don’t pick them up,
they don’t have them.’’ This has
involved more than eight cer-
tificates in the last few weeks.

The permits were available
for the three Wednesdays of
Rush, but Chief Sutton says that
at university direction, they are
now issued for Friday and
Saturday nights only. At this
point, the chief is the only one
who can sign the permits.

“They end at midnight,” Sut-
ton stressed. ‘‘The law
specifically says 11 o’clock. The
eleven to midnight grace period
is extended to allow the party to
wind down without suddenly
cutting everything off. That ex-
tra hour is extended in the spirit
of cooperation.”’

Fraternities seldom adhere
strictly to that schedule.
‘“‘They’ve been pushing it,”’ the
chief said, ‘‘but not too hard.”’

One night during Rush, Sutton
went around after midnight and
ended ten parties for noise con-
siderations.

“I found the greatest amount
of cooperation in all but one
fraternity,” the chief recalled.
“T think the time just slipped up
on them. They were very coop-
erative about shutting it down.”

At one fraternity which Sut-
ton declined to specify, he ‘‘con-
tacted the president of the
house and told him that his per-
mit had expired and he would
have to cut it off.”’

Sutton says the president
“tried, I felt, to lay his respon-
sibility for not controlling his
house on the police.

Felon to get degree

Application to be reviewed in May

By JOHN CLEGHORN
Chief Editor

A Washington and Lee stu-
dent who has been convicted of
a felony will be eligible for a
W&L undergraduate degree in
May, the Student Affairs Com-
mittee ruled Monday.

The Student Affairs Commit-
tee (SAC) voted unanimously to
accept a recommendation from
the Student Control Committee
to suspend for one year the
diploma of William Dederick
who was convicted of selling co-
caine, possession of cocaine
with intent to distribute and
possession of marijuana seeds.

According to Dean of
Students Lewis John, the stu-
dent’s application for a degree
will be reviewed by the faculty
in May at the same time that all
other degree applications for
1984 .commencement are
reviewed.

The decision made Monday
by the SAC closed the question
of Dederick’s diploma which
was opened after his arrest last
spring.

The Lexington Police Depart-
ment arrested and charged
Dederick in May, only a few
days before he was to be
graduated. The faculty met that
week and voted to have the ap-
propriate student disciplinary
committee study the case
before making a decision on the
degree, Dean John said.

Because the case did not in-
volve honor by _ university
definition, it first came to the
Student Control Committee
(SCC), which is made up of
undergraduate class presidents
and vice-presidents and law
school class presidents.

After SCC Chairman Charlie
Alcorn had _ independently
studied the facts of the case, the
SCC voted unanimously Oct. 4
to recommend the one-year
suspension, Dean John said.

The SAC then voted
unanimously to accept the SCC
recommendation.

Dean John explained that an

earlier study of the case was
postponed until the student’s
trial. He said that parts of the

court record were used by the
SCC to clarify the facts.

Alcorn said he told the other
members of the SCC to ‘‘feel
out’’ the opinions of their consti-
tuents on the issue to help them
make their judgment. He said
that because the vote for
suspension was unanimous, he
felt the board was confident of
its decision. (A vote must pass
the SCC with no more than two
dissensions. )

‘“‘We were between a rock and
a hard place in Bill Dederick’s
case because he had finished his
academic _requirements,”’
Alcorn said.

Chief discusses ABC laws with frats

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

Lexington Police Chief
Lawrence O. Sutton will be
meeting with the Interfraterni-
ty Council tonight to ‘‘discuss
various problems that are real
or perceived on both sides.”’

The main agenda item will be
the Virginia law, effective last
July 1, which forbids those
under the age of 19 from con-
suming alcohol, including beer.

Representatives of the state
Alcoholic Beverage Control
Board will attend and explain
their policies to representatives
of the fraternities.

Sutton is uncertain what tack
the ABC Board will take in en-
forcing the regulations.

‘“‘We agree that we can’t ar-
rest every 18-year-old who

Alcorn explained that since
Dederick had completed his

degree requirements, his case
was a different situation from a

student who was still working
on his degree.

‘‘We want to make it clear to
the student body that any stu-
dent that comes before a stu-
dent disciplinary board on a
drug charge is going to face
significant repercussions,”’
Alcorn said.

Next week the SCC will
review the case of Thomas J.
Rorhig, a Washington and Lee
senior who was convicted of
selling marijuana and posses-
sion of marijuana seeds with in-
tent to distribute.

The SCC will make a recom-
mendation to the SAC on
whether or not Rorhig will be
allowed to continue as a student
at W&L, Dean John said.

drinks beer,” he said. ‘‘Beyond
that, I don’t know what the
guidelines will be.”’

He emphasized, however:

“The question is not whether or
not the law is going to be enforc-
ed — merely how.”’
‘ Sutton said that to his
knowledge, there was never an
ABC agent in Lexington <-~ing
Rush. ‘‘If there’d been one, I
think you’d know about it,’”’ he
said.

This may have led to less cau-
tion by the fraternities as Rush
progressed. “I think it is
natural that people have to be
reminded to be careful of ac-
tivities that may get them in
trouble,’’ Sutton said.

“The longer you do something
without creating a problem for
yourself, the more careless you
become.”’

He declined to speculate how

much manpower the Salem of-
fice of the ABC Board will con-
centrate around campus after
the Oct. 13 meeting.

The chief said that his depart-
ment will be providing alcohol
enforcement authorities
‘‘whatever assistance is need-
ed. We will be working closely
together. It will be a mutual ef-
fort.”

In his talks with fraternity
presidents and IFC officials,
Sutton said, ‘‘We made it quite
clear that we do intend to en-
force the law, but we plan to do
it in a manner that will foster
voluntary cooperation, not with
a hard-nosed approach that
would lead to confrontation.

“‘T also promised them that I
would contact the members of
the state ABC Board and I
would seek the same spirit from
them.”’

  

“I’m not going around sniff-
ing every paper cup that I
might see an apparent 18-year-
old holding in his hand,’’ the
chief said. ‘I prefer to look at it
from the standpoint of control.
Control is the key to the pro-
blem.”’

“If a subject appears to be af-
fected by alcohol and/or
drugs,”’ he explained, ‘‘the per-
son is approached and if the

odor of alcohol is detected, they
would be required to produce
I.D. establishing their age.”’

“T will arrest any 18-year-old
I see obviously consuming an
alcoholic beverage in public,”’
Sutton said.

“If that 18-year-old is ob-
viously drunk or is creating a
problem, then I will investigate
to see if that was the result of

On Honor’s edge

The shower of drug-related arrests and investiga-
tions that began last srping and has carried over to
this fall has posed W&L with many new decisions.
While such eases are terribly usual and unpreceden-
tal in the world of prosecution, the W&L community
must now decide where it puts such cases in relation
to honor.

We W&L students have grown to feel confident of
leaving books, watches, clothes, etc. anywhere on the
Hill. We derive that confidence from the knowledge
that individuals who are not trustworthy and
honorable can be effectively purged from the W&L
community.

While we do not bicker with the recent decision
made by the Student Affairs Committee and the Stu-
dent Control Committee, we see the need to shine a
bright light on it and other similar situations. Because
Mr. Dederick was arrested and charged at the last
minute, the University and its disciplinary boards
were put in a very tricky and touchy position. Had the
arrest been made as little as two weeks earlier, their
decision might well have been different.

But the decision does raise the question of a prece-
dent. Although the circumstances of the felony did not
qualify for an honor hearing, the question of honor un-
mistakeably must enter the decision.

Here in a university community where a student
may be expelled for looking over a shoulder or for
stealing a $20 Cross pen, we question whether there is
a place for a student who has been convicted of deal-
ing hundreds and possibly thousands of dollars in nar-
cotics. More importantly, does that student deserve
the same W&L diploma earned by all the others who
have lived within the bounds of honor for four years?

We believe not.

In his article of Oct. 6, Nelson
Patterson states, ‘It is not the
responsibility of the EC to pay
for students’ mistakes, care-
lessness, or follies...Rather,
funds are given organizations
with the expectation that they
be handled and spent judicious-
ly.”’ Apparently, in Mr. Patter-
son’s mind, the Mock Conven-
tion is a careless student
organization, recklessly throw-
ing money away on any and
everything. I assure you,
nothing could be further from
the truth.

I will open my records for Mr.

Observations on coed

To the Editors:

After reading Mr. Hale’s ex-
hortation for student involve-
ment in the determination of the
coeducation issue, I felt com-
pelled to scribble down some
observations which have been
crossing my mind of late. Un-
doubtedly, the decision to either
remain a single-sex institution
or change to coeducation will
not be satisfactory to all
members of the W&L communi-
ty — past and present. Presi-
dent Wilson has many impor-
tant considerations to ponder
before he makes his recommen-
dation to the Board of Trustees
in February. He has stated that
he does not wish to ‘‘alienate’’
people — good luck. It is a
credit to his integrity as an
educator and a reflection of his
concern for the school’s welfare
that he even raises the coeduca-
tion issue. However, by doing
so, he risks creating an ex-

when this article is obviously
his editorial opinion). Ap-
parently Mr. Patterson is gifted
with ESP and can read minds,
although his ‘‘discoveries’’ are
far from being correct.

I can assure Mr. Patterson
that not only has the Finance
Committee raised one sixth of
its goal, but it is currently in the
process of sending out another
request for funds from most
prominent corporations.

In asserting $6,000 in bonds
will not be available until after
the Convention, Mr. Patterson
is again mistaken, as is general-
ly the case throughout his arti-
cle. The ‘misunderstanding’
about the bonds’ due date has
been resolved, to the effect that
the Mock Convention will take
in more than was originally an-
ticipated.

I certainly hope Mr. Patter-
son’s fears are allayed, and
before any more “crying, weep-
ing, and gnashing of teeth” on
his part, I suggest he
thoroughly look into whatever
he chooses to discuss.

tremely detrimental rift be-
tween the institution and its
alumni, faculty and students.
The school has existed for 234
years as a single-sex institution.
The idea of women attending
W&L is abhorrent to many.
President Wilson must decide
whether coeducation could
cause a change in support of the
school. He must consider not on-
ly possible alterations in finan-
cial contributions made by
alumni, and student fees but
also changes in the intangible
aspects of single-sex education
which are so inherently impor-
tant at W&L.

President Wilson and the
other committees which will
study the issue must be ex-
tremely diligent and thorough
in their undertaking. They must
determine beyond any
reasonable doubt, that the
school will benefit substantially
from coeducation if they are to
recommend change. Coeduca-
tion for the sake of having
women present is rot. If finan-
cial and academic admissions
consideration indicate absolute
necessity for a switch then the
change should be recommend-
ed. However, if the various
groups which study the issue
cannot definitely prove that the

Review and Outlook Jenevein on coed issue

Trustees this year for a final
decision. It could be dismissed
as in the past. It could be im-
plemented by Fall, 1985. In any
case, the student voice will be
heard and considered before
that final decision is made.

As President of the Student
Body, I consider it my respon-
sibility to air that student voice,
whatever it may be. As at least
600 of you are aware, the Ex-
ecutive Committee conducted a
poll on Wednesday, Oct. 5, to
tap student sentiment on
coeducation. It was an informal
poll with a wide margin of er-
ror. Many people never even
knew it was being conducted.
And that was precisely our in-
tent. We wanted to know what
students thought before they
were bombarded with statis-
tics, peer pressure, lobbying,
professors’ opinions or anything
that could change their minds.
In my unprofessional opinion,
we got what we wanted.

The poll showed 75 percent of
the students voting against
coeducation. That’s a 3:1 ratio.
Of further interest, there were
as many votes against coeduca-
tion that included creative ex-
clamations unfit for print as
there were votes for coeduca-
tion. That seemed to indicate
that students against accepting
women were more adamant in
their feelings than students in
favor of the change.

But, again, I realize the
limitations of our poll, and I
don’t place undue validity in it.
We will conduct a subsequent
poll after students have had a
chance to better acquaint

least maintain the present
academic and financial posture
of the school, single-sex educa-
tion must continue.

Finally, throughout the infor-
mation gathering and decision
making procedure, President

Wilson should continually up-
date the W&L community on the
proceedings. As Mr. Hale urged
last week, the W&L student
body must get involved. Con-
tinual status reports would pro-
vide incentive for participation,
instigating further response to
various aspects of the issue
which will doubtlessly be rais-
ed.

Washington and Lee will cer-
tainly survive this year and the
issue of coeducation. Two hun-
dred, thirty-four years, and
several wars have not
destroyed it yet. It took dedica-
tion and involvement on the
part of many individuals to
facilitate W&L’s past success.
We must continue the tradition
of intense involvement in the in-
stitution, especially this year, if
it is to thrive in the future.

January 19, 1983, was not just
another day at Washington and
Lee University. That afternoon,
a huge crowd packed Evans
Dining Hall to witness the in-
troduction of W&L’s 2ist presi-
dent.

When Dr. John Wilson step-
ped up to the podium, Evans
Dining Hall exploded with a
roar of applause. A Rhodes
Scholar, successful teacher,
former Wells College president,
and a_ respected individual,
John Wilson was surely ‘‘our
man for the job.”

Nine months have passed,
and all but a few people are still
applauding. The new president
is making waves.

Rarely has an issue aroused
so much controversy and emo-
tion, bitterness and debate as
that of coeducation. The issue
has come up twice before, but
now Wilson wants to put it to
rest. What he’s gotten in unrest.

It boils down to whether W&L

Opinion
Controversy over coed could damage W&L

applicants and, at the same
time, maintain high academic
standards. Public and private
secondary schools nationwide
are, it seems, turning out fewer
graduates. A birth rate that has
dipped in the last 15-20 years
has a lot to do with the problem.

Figures indicate that in the
next decade alone the number
of graduating high school
seniors will drop 26 percent.
That means competition among
colleges will greatly increase,

vying for the ‘‘cream of the

the university will remain the
same. It’s feared, then, that
sports such as football and
lacrosse will be crushed and
fraternities ruined, because
there won’t be as many males to
choose from. Housing is another
concern, as is alumni reaction
to the move.

As the coed controversy takes
shape, it’s becoming readily ap-
parent who the opponents are.
It appears that a substantial
percentage of faculty and staff
are in favor of coeducation,

are against. The ‘‘us-against-

an issue in Baltimore

By STEPHEN MATRAZZO

As a Baltimorean, I often find
it easy to exaggerate the na-
tional importance of events in
my home town. This time
around, however, the nation
does have something to gain by
learning from Baltimore.

As the black populations in
our major cities have increas-
ed, so has the political polariza-
tion of the races. Only months
ago, Chicagoans provided us
with a very ugly example of the
possible results of such
polarization. Many blacks
responded to the battle cry,
“It’s our turn!’ while vast
numbers of whites crossed
once-impenetrable party lines
simply to avoid having a black
mayor. The result of such
racially motivated behavior by
voters and candidates has been
an increase in overall racial
tension and impotent city
government. It doesn’t always
have to be that way.

The stage was set for this
year’s Baltimore municipal
elections by the election last fall
of Baltimore State’s Attorney
Kurt Schmoke. Schmoke, a 32-
year old black lawyer, combin-
ed black support with an unex-
pected number of white votes to
oust white incumbent William
Swisher. With Schmoke’s vic-
tory came the widespread

realization that candidates
could actually win cross-racial
support.

That simple yet revolutionary
concept came to fruition in the
Democratic primaries held last
month. (The Republicans are a
non-entity in Baltimore. Sorry,
guys.) Serious black contenders
emerged for each of the three
citywide offices, yet appeals to
race were muted if they existed
at all. Some of the white Demo-
cratic clubs, the traditional
power brokers in Baltimore
politics, went so far as to en-

dorse blacks for ‘Comptroller
and City Council President, in-

cluding the lily-white Stonewall
organization, much maligned
by blacks and others as the last
bastion of all-white machine
politics in Baltimore, which en-
dorsed Clarence Burns, a black,
for Council president, rejecting
an old ally, the previously men-
tioned William Swisher, who
also sought the office.

At the same time black
Democratic clubs such as the
Eastside organization endorsed
the incumbent mayor, William
Donald Schaefer, over
challenger William Murphy,
scion of a locally prominent

black family, who had made a
great reputation as an attorney
and judge and would in any
other city command universal
balck support.

After a campaign
remarkably free of racial over-
tones, the majority-black
Baltimore electorate voted con-
vincingly for a City Council in
which whites outnumbered
blacks and which included two
white council members from a
district that is two-thirds black.
(Each district elects three
council members.) Burns was
elected council president with
the help of pluralities in the
white ethnic areas of south and
southeast Baltimore, while the
majority-black voters returned
incumbent Comptroller Hyman
Pressman to office over a
viable challenger, state
legislator John Douglass.

‘Lhe best sign of all, however,
had to be that Schaefer, faced
with a strong black challenge,
won not only an overall majori-
ty but a majority of the black
vote. That’s right; if absolutely
no whites had voted, Schaefer
would’ve won on the basis of
black votes alone.

All in all, both black and
white Baltimoreans performed
well in this rejection of overt
racial appeals. Harold
Washington and Eddie
Vrdolyak should take note and
learn.

So should a lot of other people.

believe this tradition will be
jeopardized by allowing women
to attend W&L. Those favoring
coeducation, on the other hand,
argue that the sheer necessity
of accepting women merely in
order to survive outweighs any
consideration of tradition.

Proponents of coeducation
have a valid concern. Never-
theless, weighed with argu-
ments opposing coeducation,
the scales become topped
against them.

Coeducation advocates have
concerned themselves with the
question of what happens if
W&L doesn’t go coed. Can it
continue to draw ‘‘quality”’
students? Can it continue to
compete with other top colleges
and universities? Can it keep
from shrinking in size?

For them, coeducation is a
solution, a way out of a problem
which every year gets bigger.

In their fear of what lies
ahead for W&L if it remains
single sex, supporters of
coeducation have seemingly
overlooked a very important

question. They may have
forgotten to ask whether
coeducation will improve the
university. Is their ‘‘yes” vote
in favor of accepting women a
vote prompted more out of
deseration and less out of a
belief that the university will
benefit from the move (i.e., that
it will help students better in-
teract and thus better prepare
them for the outside world)?
Have they concerned them-
selves too much with ‘What
happens if W&L doesn’t accept
women?” and failed to ask
‘What happens if W&L does?”’

The coeducation issue is too
important to be decided upon
without careful examination of
every facet surrounding it. At
risk is the identity of an institu-
tion which has stood for 235
years. Those for coeducation as
well as those against must look
at the issue in every light and
with a clear mind.

The new president is making
waves. Open discussion and opi-
nion must not be drowned amid
the turbulence.

 

Groups aid candidates

Buchanan on special interests

by NELSON PATTERSON
StaffReporter .

The charge that Walter Mon-
dale and other Democratic
presidential hopefuls are selling
out to special-interest groups is
a moot point, according to W&L
Politics Professor William
Buchanan. As he sees it, many
of the groups are being forced to
back candidates earlier and
earlier to maximize their
political clout because of the in-
creased role of the media in na-
tional elections.

‘What has changed in
politics is television. Television
has made it very expensive to
conduct primary campaigns,
and with the importance they
place on early primaries - the
Iowa caucus and the New
Hampshire primary- it forces
them to raise money quicker to
get greater exposure earlier.
Here is where unions are impor-
tant,” Buchanan said.

“Unions are organized,”
he said, ‘‘and can help to get
the grass-roots campaigning
‘done, the door-to-door stuff.
Really, the nomination may be
sewn up by what they’re doing
now more so than ever before,
due to television, the money
needed for television access,
and the impact of the union en-
dorsements.”

Buchanan counters those
critics of special — interest
politics by pointing out several
observations about the political
process. To those who say
teachers, because of their in-
volvement with the young,
should stay neutral in politics,
Buchanan asks where the line
should be drawn.

 

“Suppose it was the Na-
tional Council of Churches
backing some candidate? Could
that be supported? If you pick
out one particular group, not
legally prohibited from the
right to petition government,
you are really questioning the
appropriateness said.

In the case of the National
Education Association backing
Walter Mondale, Buchanan
noted that the teachers — and
the educational system as a
whole — have a great stake in
the policies of the federal
government.

“Teachers have a political in-
terest in this process. Look at
the federal subsidy to educa-

‘tion. The president has made

noises about the quality of
education and has called into
question their capabilities to
teach. To prohibit only those
groups with contact with young
people to become active in
politics is to deprive the group
of their consitutional right of
petition. The NEA endorsement
is one way of (practicing that
right)’’ said Buchanan.

“Take the unions. Do they
up and do this unless (the can-
didate) has some promise of do-
ing what they want? In endors-
ing this early, the question is
not ‘Should they back the can-
didate?’ but ‘Is it advantageous
todo this soearly?’

‘Does the fact that the union
(AFL-CIO) came out for Mon-
dale help him get the nomina-
tion? Of course it does. Thus it
is highly effective isn’t it?,” he
remarked.

Joyce: Prosecutor doesn’t have to be a hardnose

Candidate says he would avoid a ‘let’s get’em

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

Robert N. Joyce, Jr. says that
if he wins his race for Com-
monwealth’s Attorney, he’ll
avoid a “‘let’s get ’em, let’s
hang ’em at all costs’ attitude
as the prosecutor for Lexington
and Rockbridge County.

On Nov. 8, Joyce, who’s runn-
ing as an independent, faces in-
cumbent Republican John
Read, Democrat Larry Mann
and independent James T.
Adams.

Joyce, who currently handles
a number of defense cases, says
that being a prosecutor ‘‘won’t
change my priorities...A pro-
secutor doesn’t have to be a
total hardnose. I think there’s
room for compassion.

“You don’t set out to put not-
ches in your gun. You try to get
a fair and honest result. Your
obligation is to present what
you perceive to be the truth, and
what you believe to be the
truth.”

 

“{ think I have a sense of
justice tempered with compas-
sion,’ Joyce said. ‘“‘I see people
in unfortunate circumstances,
and sometimes they get in
situations where I might do the
same thing under those cir-
cumstances.

“When you do something
wrong, that doesn’t cast you as
a criminal for the rest of your
life.”

However, Joyce said that
although he has ‘‘a sympathetic
note in (his) soul,” there are
“people who repeatedly exhibit
anti-social conduct.”’

“T’m not an overly easy
mark,”’ he said. ‘I can
recognize when people are try-
ing to take advantage of a good
thing.”’ . Joyce is reluctant to
discuss the incumbent’s record
directly. ‘I think I can do the
job better than it’s been done in
the past,”’ he said.

“I do not want to run a
negative campaign. I want to be
positive about what I feel I can

carried since childhood,

School before attending the

University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill.
Joyce graduated from

Washington and Lee’s Law
School before becoming an
associate of attorney Eric Lee
Sisler, the position he’s held for
the last two years.

Sisler, the treasurer for
Joyce’s campaign, was the
Commonwealth’s Attorney for
this area before being defeated
by Read in November 1975.

Some observers have sug-
gested that memories of 1975
caused Sisler to encourage a
run by Joyce.

“I certainly don’t think so,”
Joyce said. “Eric is basically
apolitical now. I don’t think he’s
vengeful or would hold that kind
of a grudge.”’

Some believe that the two in-
dependents in the race will
serve as “‘spoilers,”’ dividing
the opposition to the incumbent.

“‘We probably will to some ex-
tent,” Joyce acknowledged.
“But I don’t think any vote-
splitting we do will insure
John’s re-election.

“Tt won’t automatically
benefit John. I feel like I have a
good chance of being elected
despite the fact that there are
four people in the race.”

Joyce, who announced in
May, says he chose to run as an
independent because ‘‘it was
my best chance to be in the final
race.”

“I don’t feel I had a good
chance for getting the nomina-
tion of either party because of
the other people’s political con-
nections,” Joyce said.

“I had no allegiance to one
party or the other, and I have
never been politically con-
nected with either one.”

Also, Joyce said he didn’t
want to be obligated to support
a party’s whole slate of can-
didates because of its endorse-
ment.

He said that with his indepen-
dent label, he hopes to ‘‘appeal
to people all across the

socioeconomic spectrum.”
Because he wants to increase

his recognition factor, Joyce
has been running a ‘‘do-it-
yourself”’ campaign.

“Every single poster of mine
you see in a window, I put there
myself, and introduced myself
to the proprietor,”’ Joyce said.

He says he’s visited all major
employers and nearly every
business in the county in the last
few months. Joyce says he
hasn’t yet gone door-to-door at
residences, but he’ll start that
process soon.

The candidate says he has “‘a
good rapport’’ with the citizens
of the Rockbridge area.

“‘T grew up here, and my roots
are here. I think I know the peo-
ple in the community,’ he said.

Joyce says it’s essential that
the Commonwealth’s Attorney
be respected and trusted by
those he works with.

“‘T do have and would have the
backing and support of law en-
forcement and people in the
legal system — judges, clerks,
and other lawyers,” he said.

“In my brief two years in
practice, I’ve tried to be honest.
When you tell them that you'll
do something, they have to be
able to believe you.”

EC studies open exam policy
More freedom anticipated

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

The Executive Committee ap-
pointed a subcommittee Mon-
day night to continue a study of
an open exam policy at
Washington and Lee.

Scott Mason, a junior EC rep
last year who had studied the
possibilities of an open exam
policy, reported his findings .to
the committee.

The open exam policy would
permit a student to sign up for
an exam for either 9 a.m. or 2

p.m., but he would be allowed to
take the exam any day during
the exam week at that time,
Mason explained.

In talking with department
chairmen last year, Mason said
‘“‘the majority were in favor of
an open exam policy.”

The Commerce School — ‘‘the
brunt of the problem’’— and the
math department both in-
dicated an opposition to -the
idea, though, Mason said.

“There were a lot of logistical
problems,’’ Mason said. ‘‘But I
think a lot of these problems

can be worked out. I think this is
definitely something worth
looking into.”’

Reporting on the progress of
the subcommittee studying the
possibility of more lights in the
lower parking lot, junior rep
Darby Brower said, ‘‘President
Wilson at this time doesn’t feel
the school has funds to put
lights in the lower parking lot.”

Temporary lights have been
placed in the trees, but their ef-
fectiveness has been reduced by
the leaves.

Alumni leaders to learn about

By G. BRUCE POTTER

Washington and Lee alumni

Former political prisoner to speak

Author Jacobo Timerman
will present the first lecture in
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s speaker symposium, Con-
tact ’84, on Thursday, Oct. 20.

The program will begin at 8
p.m. in Lee Chapel. The public
is invited to attend, and admis-
sion is free.

A journalist, author, and pas-
sionate advocate for human
rights and social justice, Timer-
man’s outspoken condemnation
of the military regime in Argen-
tina led to his arrest and im-
prisonment.

After 18 months in prison and
under house arrest, he was
finally released in 1979 as the
result of a world-wide cam-
paign for his freedom.

In his first book, ‘‘Prisoner
Without a Name, Cell Without a
Number,’’ Timerman
vehemently criticized the

 

Argentinian government’s
repressive policies and re-
counted the story of his arrest,
imprisonment, _ interrogation,
and subsequent torture without
being formally charged.

Timerman’s life in Argentina
was the subject of a movie on’
NBC-TV last spring.

In his most recent book, “‘The
Longest War, Israel Into
Lebanon,”’ Timerman contends
that the Begin/Sharon military
incursion into Lebanon wes
detrimental to peace-keeping
efforts in the Middle East.

Timerman has contributed
articles to the New York Times,
Newsweek, and Time maga-
zine. In addition he has recently
finished filming a segment with
Walter Cronkite for ‘Walter
Cronkite’s Universe.”’ That seg-
ment is devoted to George
Orwell’s ‘‘1984.”’

Washington and Lee and what
they think of it,’’ Atkins said.

Representatives of a variety
of student groups and types of
students were invited to the
lunch, Atkins explained.

Alumni chapter presidents,
admissions representatives and
class agents were invited for
the conference, Atkins said. A
class agent ‘‘solicits his
classmates on behalf of the an-
nual fund each year,”’ he said.

The leadership conference
combines the Class Agents
Weekend and the Alumni
Special Conference.

“The purpose behind this,’’
Atkins said, ‘“‘is to educate and
inspire our chapter presidents
and our alumni admissions peo-
ple. We hope to give the chapter
presidents some new ideas and
some new life and activity.”

A session Friday morning will
feature an admissions office
presentation of the demo-
graphic statistics ‘‘that we’ve
all been hearing about’’ in rela-
tion to coeducation, Atkins said,
adding that the issue of
coeducation probably would be
discussed.

Friday afternoon sessions
will center around student life
and the curriculum changes, in-
cluding the new distribution re-
quirements and the plus-minus
grading system.

The conference will conclude
with workshops Saturday morn-
ing for each of the three types of
alumni leaders.

WGL students work with WTBS

By PETER WRIGHT
Staff Reporter

Virginia Military Institute’s
football team made its national
television debut last Thursday
night with the help of the WTBS
(Turner Broadcasting System)
network and 14 Washington and
Lee students.

The work done by the
students ranged from collecting
statistics to reporting on
players’ injuries. The students
received a WTBS T-shirt and
were paid $25 for their work.

Approximately 50 people
were involved in the production,
and according to Prof. Robert
DeMaria, televising the game
cost WTBS over $600,000. The
lights used for the game cost
over $50,000, DeMaria said.

DeMaria also said that work-
ing for a network, such as
WTBS, provided the students
with a good learning ex-
perience. ‘Students had a
chance to work on an actual
remote and the chance to work
with paid professionals,” he
said.

According to one WTBS
reporesentative, the network
crew working the game was
pleased with the students and
the work they did. ‘‘If I had the
chance to do it again, I would
jump at it,” DeMaria said.

Tim McCune said that what
he liked about the experience
was the fact that the WTBS
crew was concerned about the
students’ learning something as
well as getting the job done. “‘I
think it was a great learning ex-
perience,” McCune said.

Youngest frats place well in ‘‘Snag’’ average

By GERALD SHEPHERD
Staff Reporter

According to the 1983 Rush
statistics, the three youngest
fraternities at Washington and
Lee have conquered their com-
mon stumbling blocks and
taken places numerically along
side the 14 well-founded frater-
nities.

The recent ‘Snag’ figures
show that Kappa Sigma receiv-
ed 17 pledges, Chi Psi took in
nine pledges and Sigma Nu got
13 pledges, bringing the young
fraternities near the average
pledge totals of fraternities at
W&L.

All the new fraternities faced
obstacles during their for-
mative stages, including a lack
of places to meet and live, at-
tempting to receive recognition
from the university community
and raising funds.

Dan Murphy, Associate Dean
of Students in charge of Frater-
nity Affairs, said, “All three
seem to be successful in their
efforts so far.” He says that
although he would not en-
courage a new fraternity at this
time, these three seem to have
overcome most of the obstacles

and have become solid parts of
the university’s fraternity
system.

Characteristics common to
all three houses include en-
thusiasm out creating a new
fraternity 1 concern about
their status the university
system: the ac. nic leaders
for the previous tw. terms have
been Chi Psi and Sigma Nu,
respectively. Washington and
Lee now has 17 national frater-
nities.

Chi Psi, the oldest of the re-
cent additions, began at W&L in
1977. No Chi Psi chapter existed
here, and Chi Psi alumni from
other universities were in-
terested in organizing a house
at W&L. Through the fall of
1980, Chi Psi had no permanent
house; according to Paul Far-
quharson, current Chi Psi presi-
dent, ‘‘That made it difficult to
rush people.”

The national chapter wanted
to buy the old Ann~ Smith
Academy, but the City of Lex-
ington refused to sell it to them.
The alumni donated money to
W&L for the purpose of buying
the old schoolhouse. The univer-
sity then bought the Academy
with the funds from the Chi Psi

alumni. Chi Psi now leases the
house from the university. Far-
quharson said that the universi-
ty has been very cooperative in
helping them overcome the

' primary obstacle of housing.

Kappa Sigma, which lost its
charter in 1970, was reinstituted
in 1979 with 15 initiates. Steve
Lemon, former Kappa Sigma
vice-president and a senior at
W&L, said a group of students
wanted to form a fraternity that
would become an alternative to
the existing chapters. Kappa
Sigma which had been at W&L
since 1873 had a strong national
chapter in Charlottesville and a
strong alumni system and ap-
peared to be a strong possibility
for a new chapter. The Kappa
Sigma fraternity regained its
charter and university recogni-
tion in 1980, but they had no per-
manent house.

The members rushed from a
rented house on Randolph
Street, but they did not have a
“special use’”’ permit, and were
thrown out. The fraternity later
put up a bid to buy their old
house on South Main Street, but
the Lexington Zoning Board and
City Council denied the request.
During 1981 they negotiated
with the university and began to

lease the current Kappa Sigma
house (located between SAE
and Pi Phi), which had been
university property for many
years. Kappa Sigma now leases

They have raised funds from

stalled within the past year.
Lemon said Kappa Sigma was
‘‘hurting for respect”’ for a cou-

ple of years, but now the house
has become an integral part of
the system. ‘‘The house was the
key to respect,” said Lemon,
“and most freshmen probably
don’t know we are a new
house.’’ He expressed apprecia-
tion to the university and said
he believes Kappa Sigma will

Sigma Nu, the most recent
addition, lost its charter in 1981

and was reinstated in 1982. The
national headquarters are
located in Lexington, and the
national made a concerted ef-
fort to restore Sigma Nu. Hous-
ing was a problem for Sigma Nu
last year. The old house was
closed, and the new members
were forced to meet in the stu-
dent center and held a couple of
parties at the Holiday Inn.

This summer, renovation
began on the house which re-
opened this fall. Washington
and Lee owns the house, and the

Ziegler’s ‘Love Poems’ opens tomorrow night

“A bittersweet comedy” is
the way Thomas J. Ziegler,
Washington and Lee University
drama professor, describes his
newest play ‘‘Love Poems.”’

The premiere of ‘Love
Poems’’ on Oct. 14 in the Boiler
Room theater will open the
1983-84 season of W&L’s Univer-
sity Theatre.

The three-act comedy will
star Shirley Ziegler of Lex-
ington as Mert Plucker and
W&L law student Philip Brown
as Frank Stimson. David Con-
ners, a W&L sophomore, will
round out the cast as Mert’s
comatose father. Senior drama
major Bob Ferguson will direct
the production.

“Love Poems’’ introduces
Mert, a woman of about 30 who
lives in New York’s East
Village and is attempting to
break out of her humdrum life
as a truck dispatcher and nurse
to her comatose father. She
enrolls in an American

literature class at NYU and
eventually becomes involved in
a bizarre relationship with her
professor (Frank).

“It is a case of opposites —she
is poor, stolid uneducated; he is
wealthy, knowledgable, prep-
pie,’’ says Ziegler. ‘‘They work
together to solve each other’s
problems.”’

This is not the first work in
which Ziegler utilizes opposites.
Both of his previous plays,
‘Weeds’ and ‘The Ninth
Step,”’ were written in a similar
style.

“T like to contrast humor and
tragedy,” says Zeigler. ‘‘My
works are comedies with
serious overtones. They delve
into fairly heavy emotions.”

What inspires a playwright to
create characters like Mert and
Frank and put them on stage for
all to meet?

my experience of subletting a
railroad flat one summer in

New York’s East Village,” says
Ziegler, ‘‘That happens to be
the setting for ‘Love Poems.’
The apartment had only three
rooms and we had to share the
bath down the hall with our
neighbors. Most of these
neighbors were Polish im-
migrants. Puerto Ricans lived
downstairs. We were the only
ones who spoke English. Mert
and Frank are based on the type
of people I met there.

“IT am very New York-
oriented,’ Ziegler continued.
“To make it in New York is
THE sign of success to a
dramatist. Broadway is the
ultimate. If you are going to
dream, you might as well
dream big/ and I dream of
Broadway.

Those dreams of Broadway
may soon come true for the
graduate of Northern [Illinois
University. Ziegler’s play ‘“‘The
Ninth Step” is scheduled to
open off broadway in New York
in February.

At the present time, Zeigler
has three new scripts in the
works.

“I try to write each day,’’
says Ziegler. ‘‘There are
moments when I am in the
mood to write but more often I
am not. Sometimes I have to
make myself work. But once I
get started, it is very enjoyable.
The characters I create seem
like old friends. To leave them
for a while and come back to
them is like renewing old
friendships.”’

DuPont displays Japanese prints

By SCOTT S. PRYSI
Special to the Phi

From October 7 to the 30th a
well-known collection of
Japanese woodblock prints on
loan from the Virginia Museum
will be on exhibit in the DuPont
Gallery. The show titled
“Hiroshige: The Tokaido
Road” is a collection of 48 prints
made between 1833 and 1834 by
the renowned Japanese artist
Ando Hiroshige (1797-1858). The

prints depict images of 19th cen-
tury Japanese life along the 300-
mile-long Tokaido Road which
in the 1930’s linked the
Tokugawa Shugunates’ ad-
ministrative capital at Tokyo
with the Imperial Residence of
the Emperor to the southwest in
Kyoto.

Hiroshige is known for his
ability to catch the precise
mood and feeling of a scene.
Characteristically (in his

prints) he tries to express the
grandeur of nature surrounding
and enriching human life, using
figures only as small elements
of the whole composition. Ac-
cording to the Virginia
Museum’s Asiatic curator Dr.
Joseph Dye, ‘‘Hiroshige focused
mainly on the changing effects
of time, the seasons, and light.”’
His work is often described as
“‘melancholic”’ due to the sub-
tle, soft, and gentle beauty he
portrays.

W&L held a commanding 24-0 §

on short runs and James White
added a 26-yard field goal. The
Maryville offense was stymied
by the General defense in the
first half, mustering only 63
yards.

Head coach Gary Fallon
stated that the Generals ‘‘had
worked on that play a bit in
practice this (last) week and
asked Kevin before the game if
he was ready. He said he was,
so we went for it. That had to
sting them a little bit.”’

The Washington and Lee har-
riers improved their season
record this past weekend to 7-1.
The Generals took first in a
quadrangular meet in Harrison-
burg. W&L finished first with a
score of 27 followed by Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
foe Catholic Univ., American
University and Eastern Men-
nonite.

Coach Dick Miller said, ‘‘We
ran well and we had a good
close group of runners.’’ This is
evident by only a 41-second
span separating W&L’s second
through fifth finishers. Frank
Pittman was the leader of this
group finishing fifth. He was
followed by Ed Gourdry, Bob
Glenn and Paul Chapman,
Coach Miller also noted that for

ed under 27 minutes at 26:52.

This week the Generals will
be host to nine women’s teams
and 13 men’s teams for the
Virginia Division II and Divi-
sion III meet. Coach Miller
commented that being at home
is not a great advantage in this
meet. He also mentioned that it
would be a tougher test for his
team than usual because only
seven participants are allowed
per school.

“If someone has a bad day
there will be no one to pick up
the slack.”’

Featured in the meet are such
powers as Liberty Baptist, Divi-
sion II, Roanoke College, who
defeated Washington and Lee
two weeks ago, and Radford,
another Division II power.

Jenevein waits and watches

By GREG AYDT
Staff Reporter

Two weeks ago, W&L football
team captain Bob Jenevein was
injured in the game against
Centre College.

The athletic department
reported that Jenevein was out
for the season. Rumors have
begun circulating though, that
these reports were too
pessimistic, and that perhaps
he might be available before
seasons end.

The injury occurred on the
last play of the first half. Jene-
vein was the only player in a
position to prevent a possible

- +. success in the

ODAC depends on
the ability to take
it one game ata

time...
5

 

touchdown by Centre’s tight
end. The players’ collision
prompted groans from the
crowd but Jenevein said he
didn’t realize that he was in-
jured until he tried to sit up.
When he tried, he felt a lot of
pain and he knew he ‘‘wasn’t go-
ing anywhere.”’

Initially there was confusion
as to the extent of his injuries.
There were two possibilities:

either stretched or crushed
nerves in the neck. In the
former case, the injury would
only be temporary, but in the
latter, there was the possiblity
that the damage would be per-
manent. The effect of the injury
was a numbing and a loss of
control. Dr. James Busch of the
W&L infirmary, as well as a
local orthopedic surgeon, and a
local neurologist, said that
Jevenein was definitely out for
the rest of the season.

Ten days after the injury, a
test was done in Staunton. The
results were encouraging, in-
dicating no permanent damage.
The prognosis was for a
recovery in about five months.
In the time since, feeling and
control have returned. Jenevein
jokingly credits some of this to
‘“‘shoulder medicine’ he has
gotten from home — cookies.

Jenevein didn’t suit up two
weeks ago against Randolph-
Macon, but did in last week’s
game with Maryville.

Even though he knew he
couldn’t play, suiting up enabl-
ed him to participate in cap-
tains’ conferences and ‘“‘fell like
part of the team.”

‘He has the same plans for this
week’s game against Hampden-
Sydney. “But maybe next
week,”’ he says. Nerves heal at
their own pace and he realizes
he may not be able to play
again.

Jenevein believes the team
can win the ODAC champion-
ship without him, because “‘suc-
cess in the ODAC depends on

the ability to take it one game at
a time, and this team is
especially capable of doing
that,” he said.

“IT want to play as much as
possible,”’ he said. So for now he
takes it one game at a time, too.
He sees improvement in the lit-
tle daily things...lifting a
Stapler, for example. Whether
he will play and for how long is
just a question of time.

Polo goes 4-0 at tournament

The Washington and Lee
water polo team dominated
their opposition in its first
weekend of Southern League
play. Sweeping the field in the
Southern League (Zone I) Tour-
nament, the Generals captured
four victories against no
defeats. The tournament was
played at the Cy Twombly pool.

‘We played pretty well. The
competition was not as strong
as I had hoped it would be,”’
head coach Page Remillard
said. Remillard also stated,
“‘We were able to execute a lot
of good offense and defense last
weekend.”’

Although the Generals’ vic-
tories were expected last
weekend, Southern League play
is crucial to the future of the

The W&L B team also par-

The tournament is the conclu-
sion to the Northeast Varsity In-

Remillard believes that the
key to the Generals success this

The Washington and Lee soc-
cer team scored two home vic-
tories over non-league op-
ponents this week, defeating the
Messiah Falcons, 2-1, on Satur-
day, and VMI, 4-0, in Tuesday’s
3rd Annual United Fund Cup.

The victory over Messiah was
the Generals’ first in three
years of playing the Falcons,
who were ranked fourth in the
national Division III poll before
the game.

The victory over Division I
VMI marked goalie Jay
Werner’s third shutout of the
season and gave the Generals a
5-2 record. W&L leads the
United Cup Fund series, 2-1.

Sophomore forward Bill
Hoomes got both the goals
against Messiah, taking advan-
tage of defensive errors by the
Falcons both times. When
Falcon goalie David Young
couldn’t cleanly handle Mark
Sullivan’s shot, Holmes was
there to send in the rebound for
a 1-0 lead just before healftime.

» And at the 67 minute mark
% Holmes’ throw-in deflected off

Messiah’s Dale Mylin into his
own goal for a 2-0 W&L lead.
Head coach Rolf Piranian
praised his team for its oppor-
tunistic play on the two goals,
commenting that it was ‘‘good
soccer’’ being there for the re-
bound on the first goal. Of the
second goal he said, ‘‘We’ve
worked hard on re-starts (like
the throw-in) in practice. We

forced them into making that
error.”

The Falcons threatened late
in the game, scoring with 6:48
left for the 2-1 final score.

The Generals dominated in
the 4-0 victory over the Keydets,
producing their highest score of
the season. Piranian com-
mented that his players looked
like they were “finally fired up
about playing.”’

Holmes nearly got his third
goal in a row for the Generals
on a fast break with nine
minutes left in the first half, but
Keydet goalie Sean Miller trip-
ped him in the penalty box,
leading to Roland Simon’s
fourth goal of the season on the
ensuing penalty kick.

Holmes did get his third goal
of the season in the second half,
however, as he took Steve
McGrath’s centering pass from
the right side and gave the
Generals a 2-0 lead.

Freshman Peter Van Son got
his first college career goal 15
minutes later, and McGrath
brought the total to four, thanks
to an assist by Gary Clements.

W&L goes on the road next
week, traveling to Gettysburg
College on Saturday and
visiting ODAC adversary
Lynchburg College on Wednes-
day.

Gettysburg, winner of four
games in a row, ‘‘will be the
toughest test so far,” according
to Piranian. ‘“‘They’re looking
forward to playing us because
we stuck it to them last time,’’
he said.

Pennsylvania, the Jersey
royal hari-kari over last
weekend’s picks. This week I’ll
let up on the Prophet of
Presumption with some
hopefully less troublesome
tries. The proclamations are 1)
“If the Generals get behind ear-
ly, they’ll be in trouble against
H-SC. Cannot have a letdown
from last week. Generals by
five.’’ 2) On the pro scene, the
Prophet takes Detroit, Pitts-
burgh, New York (needless to
say he hasn’t picked anyone
over his Giants or Jets yet).
And on Monday night he’ll take
the Packers over the ’Skins just
to make you upset — as if he
needs any additional help. 3)
Finally, on the World Series, the
Prince warns that the O’s will
be hurt by the lack of a DH.
Steve Carlton could also prove
to be a nuisance. However, as
long as Palmer stays closer to
the booth than the field
Baltimore’s pitching should
give them the edge. ‘‘Baltimore

serious side, or is it really? The

Fraternity influence too much on the Hill?

To the Editors:

Last week in the ‘Front
Lawn” section of the Phi, John
Cleghorn wrote the following in
considering the fraternity situa-
tion: ‘‘President Wilson must
be allowed the opportunity to
simply raise the questions. And,
in turn, the fraternities must
give ample time and study to
the questions which affect 800
men at Washington and Lee.”
The sentence, even the article,
is well written. The number,
however, haunts me. 800. Just
800. What, may I ask, ever hap-
pened to the rest of us? Am I to
understand that the fraternity
situation here at W&L doesn’t
affect those 550 of us who have
chosen to remain indepen-
dents? Gentlemen, I am one
such independent. I don’t feel
the effects of the fraternity
system like I don’t feel the ef-
fects of an enema. Actually, as
a junior, it doesn’t bother me
much anymore. But for you
freshmen who didn’t go the
mainstream route, your
headaches have just begun.

Enough of the metaphors, let
me get specific. I hate to use the
Mock Convention people as an
example (because I think they
are doing an outstanding job
getting that thing together), but
when I went in for an interview
for a convention position last
week, the first question I was
asked was ‘“‘What fraternity are
you in?” Although I recall giv-
ing a polite answer, what I real-
ly wanted to say was, ‘‘What in
the hell does my being in a
fraternity have to do with my
wanting a responsible position
in the Mock Convention?’’
Never mind the fact that I
wasn’t even asked “‘if”’ I was in
a frat as opposed to ‘“which.”’
Never mind the fact my inter-
viewer didn’t even consider the
possibility that I might be a
member of the 40 percent of this
student body which many peo-
ple choose to pretend doesn’t
exist. Gentlemen, what I want
to know is what the hell dif-
ference does it make? If I’m not
in a fraternity does that mean
I’m some sort of goob introvert
who can’t handle a responsible
position because I can’t com-
municate with other people? Is
there something about hazing
freshmen and abusing women
that teaches one something ex-
tra about the American political
process? What is the point of
this question other than to make
me feel excluded from the
university of which I am a stu-
dent? Gentlemen, for three
years I have tolerated that
fraternity-membership ques-
tion. For you freshmen who
didn’t join frats, get used to it.
It’s like a horsefly in your ear,
except you can’t kill it. And,
just for you poor souls, here are
some helpful hints on when it
will pop up: 1) Applications.
Every application you will ever
fill out here at W&L will have
‘include social fraternities” in
the activities section. Don’t
worry that it might be totally ir-

revelant, the people giving you
the applications just want to
know. However, don’t let them
think you are anti-social. Tell
them you throw-up every Satur-
day night.

2) At the womens’ colleges.
You are probably already very
familiar with this one. It is
always the first thing you are
asked. It takes precedence over
your name. Don’t get upset.
Fraternities are the only things
ladies have ever been exposed
to at W&L. Probably they are
just trying to make conversa-
tion. Smile and chuckle gently.
Say, “No, I’m not. But just
because you had a bad ex-
perience with one is no reason
you shouldn’t go back to W&L
for four years.”

3) Professors. They will ask
you about your fraternity
membership when you go into
their offices to visit. This is
where it’s to your benefit, guys.
When asked, look disgusted.
Say ‘‘Heavens no I’m not ina
fraternity. I find them a serious

detriment to our academic com-
munity, don’t you?”’

Unfortunately, gentlemen, it
doesn’t end with just questions.
The university obviously caters
toward a fraternity environ-
ment. Did you play basketball
in high school? Did you enjoy
it? Do you want to play in-
tramurals here? Better join a
frat, Bud. Athletics are for the
sociable, not goob introverts.
Go play Dungeons and Dragons,
or whatever it is you non-
partiers do.

But it extends further.
Gentlemen, it’s like a cancer.
Homecoming, Fancy Dress,
these weekends also serve to re-
mind you that you are outside
the mainstream. Sure the SAB
does an excellent job of pro-
viding bands and activities for
the entire university, but the
subtle reminders will smack
you in the face. How about the
nominees for Homecoming
Queen? Was there one to repre-
sent 40 percent of the student
body? And how about those lit-

 

Coed issue

(continued from page 2)

themselves with the facts sur-
rounding the issue. Let me
briefly present some of them.

Proponents of coeducation
point to a 26 percent drop in the
total number of applicants to
American colleges in the next 10
years. Those future applicants
have already been born and
counted. In the 15 states from
which W&L attracts most of its
students, there will be an even
more dramatic 35 percent drop.
In addition, coeducation’s ad-
vocates cite the increasing
tendency of high school
graduates to choose public over
private institutions. They point
out also that the percentage of
all college students who are
male has declined from 65 per-
cent in 1963 to 48 percent today,
suggesting the increasing role
women play in American higher
education.

In light of these statistics,
many propose coeducation as a
means of maintaining current
academic standards without
cutting the size of the freshman
class. According to the Admis-
sions Committee, to maintain
our high standards as well as
our single-sex status would
mean about a 33 percent
decrease in the freshman class
of 1993, and a revenue deficit of
about $600,000 per year. On the
other hand, to accept women
would not only double the eli-
gible applicants, but many
more male students would con-
sider W&L, perhaps 60 percent
more.

The question that Washington
and Lee must answer is not
simply, “‘Would we go coed?”
but rather ‘Should we go coed
as a response to the multiple
signs of bad times to come?”’
Opponents of coeducation still
say ‘‘No.”’

To many, coeducation is
simply not an alternative at
Washington and Lee. To them,
the acceptance of women in
order to survive, isn’t survival
at all. The arguments on this
side of the issue are more in-
tangible. It seems that many at
the school believe the all-male
status has quite a lot to do with
the uniqueness of the institu-
tion; and that to remove that
would be to transform the in-
stitution into something it has
never been and to destroy what
was. Opponents of coeducation
question the ability of a woman
to react as enthusiastically as a
man to the inspiration of Robert
E. Lee, who spent his life as a
leader of men, and in whom so
much of our great tradition is
founded. In short, they hold that
the great thing about
Washington nad Lee is its uni-
queness, and when the uni-
queness dies, so does the col-
lege.

To answer the question of
coeducation of W&L, we must
first answer many other ques-
tions, as individuals and as an
institution. In order for a stu-
dent voice to be heard and
respected, it must be in-
telligently expressed. Let me

encourage you to attack the
issue, learn about it, and make
a well founded decision on your
own position before the next
poll. Talk about it with your
friends. Write to the Executive
Committee or to the Ring-tum
Phi. Make posters or banners
expressing your view, but be
heard. Then no matter what the
result, or how permanent, we
will have made our feelings
known, and no one will say the
Student Body of 1983-84 sat idly

doesn’t bother me much any
more. AS an upperclassman,

Situation is just plain sad.
Omicron Delta Kappa is an
honor society, on campus that
recognizes leadership. It is a
very respectable organization.
However, one of the categories

amidst its criterion is labelled
“‘social.’”” Now how does one
cultivate social leadership
skills at W&L if one is not in a
fraternity? Good question. It’s
kind of like getting a football

scholarship without ever having
played football. And how about
all the news about President
Wilson’s meeting with the
fraternity leaders about the
grave social situation? For you
independents who make up
close to half of our student body,
you have no voice. It’s not as if

your opinion would make any
difference, it’s just that you
have no opinion.

Gentlemen, I realize I’m be-
ing sarcastic. For that matter, I
also realize I’m being some-
what nasty. But gentlemen, I
am ashamed. During classes
and on the colonnade, I meet in-
telligent and friendly guys. And
on weekends, when I go to frat
parties, the brothers I know go
out of their way to make me feel
welcome and comfortable. But
during the week, I want frater-
nities out of areas where they
don’t belong. And if that cannot
be the situation, then I want to
feel like a contributing member
and a counted voice at this in-
stitution. This university
thrives in honor, yet there is no
honor in — when it is convenient
— pretending that 550 students
simply do not exist. I am proud
of this school, and I firmly
believe it is of too high a quality
for this kind of situation.

But, sadly, my beliefs only
seem to matter if I’m in a
fraternity.

Coed vote unknown

To the Editors:

Coeducation is an issue of
great importance to this fine in-
stitution. I’ve decided how I
stand on this question. Bob
Jenevein and Todd Smith have
decided how they stand. Unfor-
tunately this is not the case with
quite a few of our fellow
students. Hard facts — i.e. ad-
missions projections — have
been sadly hard to come by.
Last year’s Phi staff, and
perhaps this year’s as well, has
reported the issue from a biased
point of view. A referendum
vote scheduled for, and I quote
the Phi, ‘‘...after the first year

law and freshman class elec- ©

tions are over’’ was held all but
secretly — and at least a week
early On Wednesday, Oct. 3, at
an unattended polling place
beside the C-school. I voted. The
vast majority of students I
queried did not.

I hereby submit that if the
E.C. wants a true indication of
student opinion, they should
schedule another referendum,
and properly publicize it. The
option of voting ‘‘UNDECID-
ED” should be included on the
ballot, and law students should
also be polled, if only in a

separate survey. Law students
share our facilities, live
amongst us, and even sit on the
E.C., and they have also ex-
perienced a coeducational col-
lege environment, some of them
even ARE women. Certainly
the opinions of the law students
would be of interest to any can-
did unbiased survey.

The Ring-tum Phi should con-
sider its moral duty to provide
accurate, unbiased reporting of
the facts behind this issue.
Editorials should be labeled as
such. Even the undecided will
agree, the issue of coeducation
is of primary importance to this
university’s future, and if we as
students are to voice yea or
nay; we need facts to decide
wisely.

Finally I quote the founder of
that other university across Af-
ton Mountain: ‘‘For here we are
not afraid to follow the truth,
wherever it may lead, nor to
tolerate any error as long as
reason is left to combat it.”
May we here at THE university
of Virginia be so wise as to
follow Thomas Jefferson’s ad-
vice.

New elections held

Caruthers wins frosh EC slot

By STEVE POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

Mac McGrew, Rob Tolleson,
Andrew Caruthers, and Glen
Brock all emerged victorious
from the freshman class elec-
tions held during the past two
weeks.

In a drawn-out election, a se-
cond poll was needed after the
first poll held on Oct. 10. was cut
short and had to be thrown out
because the ballot box was left
unattended during the day.
Voting Regulations Board
Chairman Burns Newsome and
Executive Committee Presi-
dent Bob Jenevein discussed
the problem that evening of the
election and the committee
determined the necessity of a
second election to be held
Thursday, Oct. 13.

McGrew, the new class presi-
dent, was the only one who
received a majority of votes in
the second poll. He tallied 130
votes, compared to Jim Bar-
ker’s 51 and Charles Bracken’s
32. All of the other races were
forced to go into run-offs, which

were held Monday.

In the run-offs, Tolleson, a
high school classmate of
McGrew’s, defeated Alex
Bryant by a vote of 117-90 in the
vice-presidential race, while
Brock overcame Chris Carter
by a 47-vote margin in the
University Council elections.

The Executive Committee
field was cut from its original
nine candidates to Caruthers
and Paul Clark, with Caruthers
gaining 136 votes to Clark’s 73.

The drawn-out election raised
the importance of the issue of
getting people to man the polls,
a question discussed at last
Monday evening’s EC meeting.
“‘We have a problem of getting
people to watch the polls. I think
some changes need to be
made,’’ Newsome said.

One suggestion made at the.
meeting was to charge each
candidate a small fee which
would be used to pay the stu-
dents watching the polls. Some
students felt that because of the
honor system, it is unecessary
to man the polls.

Current state law requires a

person to be 19 in order to con-
sume beer and to be 21 to arink
other forms of alcohol.

“Keep high school kids out of
your parties — that’s the big-
gest problem I see,” special
agent Clarence W. Roberts of
the Charlottesville office of the
ABC Board told the group.

“The point is that you’ve got
to check I.D.’s,” he said.
“That’s going to make you or
break you.”’

Many of the regulations ex-
plained by Roberts are complex
and subject to interpretation.
Both he and Chief Sutton stress-
ed that a solid attempt by the
fraternities to comply with the
letter of the law is what agents
are looking for.

“Your good faith effort
means more than anything
else,” Roberts said.

‘Ninety-nine percent of the
ABC agents you deal with are
going to help you and explain
these laws. ABC agents are not,
as some of you may think, dic-
tators. They are public ser-
vants.”’

Chief Sutton sounded a
similar note in his remarks to
the group. “I do advocate stu-
dent control as much as possi-
ble,”’ he said. ‘‘The more you
do, the less I have to do.

He praised the fraternities for
the cooperation they showed his
department during Rush.

fraternities to become retail
outlets of alcoholic beverages,”’
Roberts said.

“There are other businesses
licensed for that function. They
pay much more taxes than
you’ll ever pay. They should
have exclusive control of
alcoholic beverages in your
area.”’

The ‘‘no sales’ provision is
very strictly enforced. A soft
drink vending machine, for ex-
ample, must be made non-
operational during a party.

“Get it out of there, because
it’s going to get you in trouble,”
Roberts said.

Chief Sutton suggested that

agents may gain access to par-
ties.

“They merely have to give
you the opportunity to do what
you would normally do. If they
say they were invited by friends
or that they are someone’s date,
and you invite them in, they are
then your guest, and are free to
act on any violation they see.”

“Regardless of what ruse is
used, any open door is an invita-
tion,” he continues. ‘‘It is not a
crime to assume an identity. If I
hide my identity, that does not
encourage you to commit a
crime.”

Timerman rescheduled

A lecture by author Jacobo
Timerman originally scheduled
for tonight at Washington and
Lee has been postponed and
rescheduled for Thursday, Nov.
¢.

Timerman’s lecture is the
first presentation of the univer-
sity’s speaker symposium, Con-
tact ’84.

According to Contact co-
chairman Marty Harmon,
Timerman’s agent explained
that Timerman is suffering
from physical ailments which
have resulted from his torture
in Argentina.

The program will begin at 8

p.m. in Lee Chapel. The public
is invited to attend, and admis-
sion is free.

A journalist, author, and pas-
sionate advocate for human
rights and social justice, Timer-
man will discuss his imprison-
ment in Argentina and the
political climate in Latin
America.

He is the author of the 1981
volume ‘Prisoner. Without a
Name, Cell Without a
Number.”

Timerman’s life in Argentina
was the subject of a movie on
NBC-TV last spring.

 

 
Page 2, The Ring-tum Phi, October 20, 1983

This year’s freshman class elections had to be held
twice because in the first vote, one poll was left unat-
tended.

At Monday night’s Executive Committee meeting,
Voting Regulations Board Chairman Burns Newsome
complained to the Committee that there was a lack of
incentive for students to man the polls. _

Sophomore representative James White suggested
paying students to man the polls and received the
backing of President Bob Jenevein. The money to pay
the students would come from an assessment col-
lected from each candidate.

Undoubtedly the polls must be manned. The
presence of an Honor System does not ensure that
dishonorable acts will not occur.

There are many possibilities for solving this pro-
blem — some easier than others — which the Commit-
tee must evaluate.

But the Committee should not presume that respon-
sibility may be bought.

A social pavilion

The question of a student pavilion has been the sub-
ject of discussion at W&L for almost two years now.
Last fall a grain party at Zollman’s Pavilion was shut
down by the ABC and since then, other groups have
been hesitant to hold parties there. This year the new
drinking law has tightened the ABC control even
more. There seems to be no question that a new, more
convenient structure is imperative.

The more pertinent question then has boiled down
to the dimensions and intended use of the structure.
Should it be a building adequate to house large parties
or a small concert? Or should it be more of an indoor
arena large enough to house about three tennis
courts?

While the need for such an arena may be quite
realistic, it seems that a more centrally located social
gathering place is more pressing. A_ pavilion
specifically designed for social events, which is what
an EC subcommittee advocated last year, would
serve as useful in keeping students out of the ABC
threat as well as providing a place where all students

— independents and fraterntiy members — could .

mingle and have a good time.

Although the Board of Trustees vote is likely to be
put off until Febuary, we hope that in the interim an
appointed committee is able to find a satisfactory
solution that will appease both factions.

To the Editors:

To many people at Washing-
ton and Lee, the Honor System
is much more than simply not
lying, cheating, or stealing. It is
a way of life both on and off
campus. Everyone knows the

Honor System has been abused
again and again, but the case of
William Dederick is truly
outrageous. The line between
honor and dishonor must be
drawn somewhere. Charlie

Mature resopnse needed

To the Editors:

Like most of my colleagues, I
am opposed to coeducation at
Washington and Lee. I also
agree that we must step out and
be vocal in our opposition. But I
also feel that we must be re-
sponsible and mature in our re-
sistance.

One of the slogans or “battle
cries” I’ve heard on campus
lately is “Women in the hay, but
not every day.” While this may
reflect the opinions of some, or
even most of the student body, it
is also playing right into the

hands of the proponents of
coeducation.

One of ‘‘their’ leading
arguments is that an all-male
atmosphere breeds a “sexist
and chauvinistic” attitude, one
in which the students develop a
“‘warped’’ attitude toward
male-female relationships.

We have many fine argu-
ments in our favor, all of which
you have heard before. We must
present them in a way that
substantiates and perpetuates
that of our opposition,

Committee and the Student Af-
fairs Committee have done
W&L a great disservice by
allowing this convicted felon to
remain a part of the university
community. The Executive
Committee should take notice!
Perhaps this is asking too
much of the Executive Commit-
tee. Bob Jenevein and Co.
publicized their own fear of
responsibility in Jenevein’s let-
ter to the editors (Ring-tum

ed and ‘informal’ poll, Jene-

of? They are afraid that their

would not withstand criticism.

Cadle stirs independent voices

To the Editors:

I would like to take this oppor-
tunity to thank Joseph Cadle for
his article which appeared in
the Phi last week. Mr. Cadle, I
would like to thank you for
poignantly expressing your
feelings, my feelings, and the
fleeings of a good number of
other independents here at
W&L.

Recent editions of the Phi
have discussed the ‘“‘glamour’’

What about the independ-
ents?

The independents’ who make
up approximately 40 percent of
W&L’s student body, deserve as
much attention as the frater-
nities. It is only fair that the
alumni should review indepen-
dent life. Further, President
Wilson should be concerned

with independent life and ways
of improving it.

It is about time that Mr. Cadle
and all independents stand up
for their rights as independents.
Independents are constantly
getting neglected by the W&L
community. I urge any and all
independents to speak up and be

counted. Let President Wilson,
the deans, the faculty and the
alumni know how you feel. Also,
I urge you to ask the ad-
ministration to begin taking ef-
fective measures to improve
social life for independents.

Don’t forget women’s deeds

To the Editors:

According to Mr. Jenevein,
many students at W&L “ques-
tion the ability of a woman to
react enthusiastically to the in-
spiration of Robert E. Lee,” I
suggest to all those men a crash
course in Women’s History.
They might try, before coming
to this conclusion, looking at the
work done by Harriet Beecher
Stowe, Abigail Adams, Eliza-
beth Cady Stanton, Susan B. An-
thony, Jane Addams, Charlotte
Perkins Gilman, Virginia
Woolf, Simone de Beauvoir,
Eleanor Roosevelt, Margaret
Mead, Indira Gandhi, Shirley
Chisholm, Coretta Scott King,

Barbara Jordan or Golda Meir,
plus countless others. I might
also add that a little investiga-
tion into the values held by
Robert E. Lee himself might
suggest that he was more will-
ing to accept and encourage
change than they are.

So much for the easy life I
praised three weeks back. The
threat to the university requires
all our action. It really does.

Oh. Before I start; I’m not go-
ing to talk about the frater-
nities. Mr. Wilson, with more
haste than judgment, has linked
their problems to the coeduca-
tion issue. I won’t. I should say,
though, that, all their present
difficulties considered, I should
still shudder to imagine life at
the university without their in-
numerable positive contribu-
tions. Mr. Wilson may stay here
long enough to see that. His er-
ror proceeds from inexperience
and from ignorance.

Now, I have yet to see one
good argument for coeducation.
I have been scolded, preached
at, and damned by priests,
presidents, and professors. Not
one has been able to explain to
me why we ought to join the
race to the bandwagon of
‘progress.’

Some in the past have put
coeducation on the same level
as racial integration: they
claim it is a moral duty which
we simply must fulfill. This is of

course patent nonsense. There'
are no reasons to assume that
sex discrimination is a pressing
cause in education. Women are
in at Yale, Harvard, Columbia,
and Sewanee. One or both par-
ties may run one for vice presi-

dent in 1984. Of the three all-

male civilian colleges in the
land, only ours is worth going
to. I fail to see our moral obliga-
tion to go coed; we’re hardly
depriving anyone, you see.
‘Aha,’ says the enemy, ‘If
women are now important in
the ‘real world’? we should
learn to deal with them in col-
lege, just to be prepared.’ True
enough; but why go about it by
coeducation? A liberal educa-
tion should suffice. Through it
we join the great fraternity of
the learned, its members not
separated by time, by culture,
tongue, or race; nor by sex, nor
Death itself. We walk in the
mind with Plato and Dante and
Dr. Johnson; and Dame Julien
of Norwich, Jane Austen, and

 

Opinion

the Bronte sisters. We under-
stand women, as we understand
figures more distant, Roman
essayists and Chinese poets,
through the mind. What can
coeducation add to that? All we
need are willing teachers, will-
ing students.

‘That’s just it,’ says the
enemy. ‘Look at the demo-
graphics. Unless we go coed, we
either have to take fewer
students — not enough to keep
operating — or we have to lower
our standards of quality.’ Now,
this is a very popular argument.
Mr. Wilson, prompted no doubt
by the power behind the throne,
Bill Hartog, is very fond of it.
Unfortunately, it is a very poor
argument. First, it doesn’t take
enough account of the fact that
not all schools compete for the
same student pool. Not just
everyone is right for us, or we
for them. But the worst is this:
the false meaning given to the
word ‘quality.’ By ‘quality, the
coed conspiracy really means
‘board scores.’ I said last time
that there’s more to life than
board scores. No education is
worthy of the name if it creates
squibs who test well, but have

no feeling for sunsets, poetry,

and the right fork. We can look
more carefully at writing
samples. We can listen to the

Alumni Admissions folk more
openly. We can, as Dr. Delos
Hughes suggests, let prospec-
tives design their own applica-
tions. But let’s do something
more than scout for standardiz-
ed people; for those make but
poor scholars. They are in-
capable of inspiration. And
whatever we do, let us have
some intellectual honesty from
Washington Hall.

For you see, there is a
positive argument against
coeducation. Cardinal Newman
knew it: knew that the universi-
ty is a mill for the manufacture
of gentlemen. And no one can be
a scholar without being a gen-
tleman; without that fine sense
of intellectual honor which will
not permit one to plagiarize, to
falsify data, to fake ex-
periments. And in our case, the
manufacturing of gentlemen
will cease when we become a
coed institution. Not because
women cannot be honorable; let
no one suggest that. But
because for us to remake
ourselves would be too costly.

Every parish, regiment, and

school has a_ particular
character: a function of its
past, its nature (the two are
one). Ours is eminently suited
to mold gentlemen. For as
thinkers since Aristotle have
known, until by education the
mind is argued into virtue, the
habit of goodness must be in-
culcated by upbringing. We do
that here by the Honor System.
Its only real claim on our obe-
dience is its antiquity and our
reverence for that: no mere
fear of punishment will suffice
to deter the wicked. Yet if we
can be false to ourself in one
way, what argument do we
make to the next call for ‘enter-
ing the 20th Century’? And what
sort of folk will we get, these
prospectives who got away, but
who would come as long as we
don’t ask them to develop them-
selves, who will graciously con-
descend to come here if we are
false to our past? It is not to be
thought of; it would be the ruin
forever of our university. Let
open the door to one so funda-
mental a change, and nothing
can stop the tide.

Coeducation is, simply,
suicide. I move we come in off
the ledge.

 

By PROFESSOR JOHN C. WINFREY

Question: What impact will our large federal
deficits have on the prospect for continued
economic recovery?

Economists of all persuasions agree that the size
of our deficits and the debt has created special pro-
blems for a sustained recovery. The basic problem
is that financing the debt creates demand for
loanable funds. At the same time the recovery will
eventually encourage firms to demand those same

capital investment. Increased economic activity
also requires a greater portion of the money supply
to carry on the increase in day-to-day business
transactions. With a stable money supply these in-
fluences ordinarily make for higher interest rates
during recovery. But under our special cir-
cumstances it is feared that the size of the current
deficits and debt will add so much to these demands
for money that the resultant interest rates will in-
hibit investment and consumption and thus stall the
recovery.

The explanation of why the deficits are so large
rests on the particular mix of monetary and fiscal
policies which created the recession. The fiscal
policies of the Reagan administration were fashion-
ed on the “supply sider’’ theories which held that in-
flation could be reduced without creating large
unemployment. The solution was to increase ag-
gregate supply by deregulation and special incen-
tives to save. It was assumed that savings would im-
mediately be transformed into investment which
would in turn increase productivity and aggregate
supply. Most economists disagreed with this predic-
tion. The great majority, whom I will term ‘‘neo-
Keynesians,” argued that in a recession firms run-
ning at reduced capacity can hardly be expected to
invest in new plant and equipment. A smaller but

 

funds in order to expand inventories and real

Recovery will halt if Fed

more influential group the ‘‘monetarists’’ believed
that the only cure for inflation was strict controls
over the money supply.

According to some economists the supply-sider
policies have clearly failed since investment has not
been forthcoming as promised and unemployment
has been severe. However, the recession cannot be
blamed entirely on the fiscal policy of the supply-
siders. The monetary policy of the Federal Reserve
led by Paul Volcker, a monetarist, has kept interest
rates high and curtailed both consumer and invest-
ment spending.

To a large extent the large deficits have been an
automatic result of the recession as revenues have
fallen and income-security expenditures increased.
But the various “‘supply-sider’’ incentives and tax
reductions which have reduced both consumer
spending and federal revenues without any compen-
satory increase in investment have certainly ex-
acerbated the deficit problem.

The prospects for continued recovery depend im-
portantly on the Federal Reserve. Even the neo-
Keynesians (who have in the past been accused of
claiming that ‘‘money doesn’t matter’’)

acknowledge that in the current situation a tight 3

monetary policy could be especially damaging. A
‘“‘worst scenario’’ pictures pricesrising slightly in
response to the drought’s effect on food prices, the
Iraq-Iran war raising oil prices, or some combina-
tion of factors and the Fed over-reacting and again
severely tightening the money supply. Economists,
except for the very pure of the monetarists, general-
ly agree that with the increased demand for money
by consumers, businesses and the financiers of the
federal debt, the recovery could well be stifled if a
tight money supply raises interest rates and cur-

tails the availability of funds for consumption and...

investment.

EC supports new pavilion

 

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

An on-campus pavilion
costing about $250,000 received
unanimous support from the
Executive Committee on Mon-
day night.

The Student Activities Board
with the help of the Buildings
and Grounds Department has
drawn up plans for a structure,
according to treasurer, John
Haywood. An additional plan
has been drawn up by the W&L
Athletic Department detailing
its ideas for the facility,
Haywood said.

The plan supported by the EC
would include a pavilion four
times the size of Zollman’s
Pavilion, a parking lot and a
picnic area. The other proposal,
which would cost $1 million,
would be a multi-purpose struc-
ture, about 16 times the size of
Zollman’s, that ‘‘would not be

compatible with a social at-
mosphere,’’ Haywood said.

If the second plan were ap-
proved by the Board, the
university would pay for the
structure. The student body,
though, would be required to
pay for the first plan. —

Under an arrangement with

University Treasurer Stewart
Epley, the student body would
borrow the money from the

school at a nine percent interest
rate over a 15 to 20 year period.
Student taxes would be increas-
ed $15 to cover the loan.

“The problem we're facing
now is whether the Board is go-
ing to consider either pro-
posal,’”’ Haywood said. ‘We
have no facility, essentially, to
hold SAB functions in.”

He added that Evans Dining
Hall is available only once a
semester and is too small and
that the Warner Center is usual-

A

ly only available for Fancy
Dress.

The SAB’s proposed structure
probably would not be able to
accomodate athletic practices
in the case of bad weather.
Should the Board approve the
SAB’s proposal, Burford Smith
said, ‘“‘A very clear delineation
has to be made as to who has
priority usage of it.”’

A discussion regarding the
paying of students to watch the
polls during class and student
body elections was tabled until
next Monday. Burns Newsome,
chairman of the Voting Regula-
tions Board, told the EC he had
problems getting students to
man the polls during last week’s
freshman class elections.

James White, sophomore
class rep, proposed that the EC
pay students to watch the polls.
The money would come from a
$5 charge imposed on all can-
didates.

“We need some kind of incen-
tive to get people out there,”’
White said. ‘The polls, I think,
haved to be manned.”’

EC President Bob Jenevein
agreed. ‘‘We have really limped
through many elections in the
past. There’s no _ incentive,
there’s no reason, besides some
intangible concerns, for any-
body to watch the polls,” he

 

 

SAB, Athletic Dept.
disagree over Pavilion

by JOHN CLEGHORN
Chief Editor

Although the Board of
Trustees is expected to hear a
proposal for a student pavilion
this weekend, it is not likely that
the board will vote on the issue
because of differences between
the Student Activities Board
and the athletic department on
the intended use of the facility.

While the need for a pavilion
is mutually agreed upon by both
groups, the SAB is lobbying for
a building of about the size of
the Warner Center and the ath-

letic department is supporting a

building of two to three times
that size which can be used for
indoor athletic practices.

Because of the differences
between the two groups on the
building, the board could
possibly table the subject until
its Febuary meeting and have a
student-administration com-
mittee study the various op-
tions, according to Frank Par-
sons, assistant to the university
president.

The proposal the SAB will
present to the trustees this
weekend will advocate a
$250,000 building of about 12,000
square feet. If the building was
much larger it would be inap-
propriate for concerts and par-
ties which the SAB has planned,
according to John Haywood,
SAB treasurer and one of the
student coordinators for the

would be used for just one pur-
pose,’ Athletic Director Bill
McHenry said.

McHenry added that the
athletic department has also

submitted its proposal for the

facility.

“Neither one of us is going to
get this facility without the
other,’’ said Dick Miller, assis-
tant athletic director.

“‘We’re not trying to build a
Cameron Hall,’’ he said.
“Neither one of us may get all
we want.”

Haywood said that one
answer to the dilemma may be
the construction of two separate
facilities.

“You just can’t take care of
every need on campus with just
one building,” Haywood said.

Parsons said that a Febuary
decision by the board on the
issue would be ‘‘timely’’
because it will make several
other fiscal decisions at that
meeting.

He stressed the need to give
more time to studying the op-
tions.
“You just don’t address the
question of a pavilion in a
vacuum,” he said.

He explained that subjects
such as ABC control of the
facility, parking, access and its
location in relation to academic
buildings are all factors that
must be considered in the deci-
sion.

Adams calls incumbent ’ ‘ineffective’

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

James T. Adams, who refers
to himself as ‘‘the fourth can-
didate” in the race for Com-
monwealth’s Attorney, says
that the incumbent is ‘‘ineffec-
tive’ and ‘‘totally insensitive”’
and that his other two op-
ponents “simply do not have the
experience or background to
handle the office.”

Adams, a lawyer since 1958
who began practicing in Lex-
ington in 1969 and was previous-
ly the Commonwealth’s At-
torney for Buena Vista, said on
the eve of a debate sponsored by
the League of Women Voters
that he had ‘‘no confidence at

 

te

I think (the voters)

all’ that he would be elected on
Nov. 8.

“I think (the voters) will go
with a Washington and Lee
graduate,’ Adams said in his
office on Washington Street.
“They’re into the social
thing...that’s all (the voters)
need to know.”

Incumbent John Read grad-
uated from V.M.I. in 1965 and
W&L Law in 1971; Democrat
Larry Mann is a 1970 W&L
graduate; and independent
Robert N. Joyce Jr. graduated
from W&L Law in 1981.

“I’ve never been a part of the
cocktail party and country club
set,” said Adams, who admits
being ‘“‘abrasive.”’

“IT tweak them every chance I

get. It’s just a foible... I have a
weird sense of humor. It keeps
me in trouble all the time.”’

Adams charges that his op-
ponents’ ‘‘ready-made contacts
in the academic community”’
could result in a bias as they ex-
ecuted their duties as the pro-
secutor for Lexington and Rock-
bridge County.

“In the administration of
criminal justice, we need to be
as equitable and impartial as
we can be,” he said. He added
that the ‘‘country club, buddy-
buddy”’ atmosphere does not
contribute to that.

Adams, who answers his
business telephone, ‘‘Yes?,’’ is
running as an independent and
was the last to enter the field.

“I was waiting for somebody
who had strong credentials who
had the ability to make changes
in the system’”’ he said. ‘‘What I
get is these two young men
—splendid chaps, I’m sure —
who don’t have the experience
to step into the office and get the
changes effected.”’

“Forgive my immodesty, but
I would go in there and
straighten that mess out quick-
ly... In two weeks, I’d do things
that should have been done
eight years ago.’’

If Gordon Saunders, the
Assistant Commonwealth’s At-
torney, had run, Adams said he
“would have stayed out of it.’’

He continued, ‘‘We can’t lose
the fairness of this criminal

legal system. This is what keeps
the country together, no matter
how bad a job people think we
do with it.”’

Adams has run a modest
campaign that has included two
newspaper advertisements and
hand-lettered posters.

“I don’t have any money,”’ he
said. “What I want to do is get
in there on the pure merits and
issues. If you ask people for

money, then they have strings.

“People have offered me
money which I’ve turned down.
It may seem idealistic, and in
never-never land, but I’d like to
see it happen.”’

Adams was not enthusiastic
about participating in last Tues-
day’s debate. “I believe the

Computer major probed

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

The possibilities of a com-
puter science major and an
upgrading of computer science
courses at Washington and Lee
are being investigated by an
eight-man faculty committee
appointed by President John D.
Wilson in August.

The goals of the committee,
chaired by Dr. Thomas Imeson,
director of the computer center,
are to determine potential for a
major field (Bachelor of
Science) in computer science,

to identify computer science
courses to be offered to students
in other areas of the university
and to decide what equipment
and faculty would be necessary
to accomplish these objectives.
Imeson said the committee,
which will report to Wilson by
Jan. 1, is still gathering infor-
mation. In conjunction with
that, a consultant, Dr. Norman
Gibbs, chairman of the com-
puter science department at
Bowdoin College in Brunswick,
Maine, has been hired. Gibbs

tion is somewhat loaded,” he
said.

“In the past, the candidates
they weren’t enamored with
didn’t come off too well.” He at-
tributed this to ‘‘pointed, inane
questions from the floor.”

The League of Women Voters,
Adams believes, is partial to
Read. ‘For one thing, he’s a
member,” he said. ‘‘As far as I

don’t know what would be.”’

quence of events was ‘‘absolute-
ly disgraceful. I think it was

ber of the League of Women

The treasurer’s report for the
Rockbridge Area League of
Women Voters dated Sept. 13,
1983, shows that Read has a
“paid membership.”’

“I’m not enamored with the
whole damned thing, but I guess

I have to appear,”’ Adams said.

Adams charges that Mann
and Joyce are ‘‘totally incompe-
tent for the job.”

“I don’t think either of these
kids has ever tried a jury case,”’
he said. ‘They just don’t know
the territory. It’ll take them a
good many years to get there.”

The incumbent’s re-election
is far from assured, according
to Adams. “My feeling is that
he’s in trouble,” he said.

Adams said that Read should
have disqualified himself from
the race because of last year’s
police scandal.

“During his tenure in office,”
Adams said, ‘‘we had one of the
most devastating debacles in
the Commonwealth; gainsay,
the rest of the country.

treated lightly. Nobody in this
has taken responsibility for
those actions.”

“There were no officer con-
victions in any of those cases
where they did not confess,”
Adams said. “‘Those who took
advantage of their right not to
testify against themself re-
sulted in hung juries or were
found ‘not guilty.’ ”

Adams said all this happened
“after three or four years of
John vouching for and support-
ing these same officers in pro-
secuting people in this com-
munity. And they were only
finally accused following in-
vestigation after investigation,
with investigators investigating
the investigators.”

The number of cases Read
has pending in court also came
under criticism by Adams.
~ The Criminal Docket of the
Rockbridge Circuit Court for
the September 1983 term shows
93 cases still to be settled, with
file dates going back to Dec. 14,
1971.

Adams charges that Read
keeps the number of cases on
the docket high “‘to justify his
budget to Richmond” and ‘“‘to
create a dynasty over there.
John has allowed the number of
cases to build up over there, and
has systematically resisted any
efforts to thin them out.

“If you clean up the docket
and get his true cases out there,
anybody could try them with
both hands tied behind his back
with law books in them...

“We don’t have that much of
a crime problem in Lexington
and Rockbridge County. We
never have.”

Adams believes the number
of cases on the docket could be
cut by about 2/3 ‘‘with justice
still being served.”

By JOHN WILTSE
Mock Convention
Correspondent

Steven Lewis and Peter
Muller are working together as
co-chairmen of the Washington
and Lee 1984 Mock Democratic
Convention.

There is no doubt in their
minds of their purpose.

‘We would really like to
stress the idea of unity. We do
have direction,’”’ said Muller, a
senior from Greenwich, Conn.

These comments came in
light of the recent internal
reorganization of the quadren-
nial Mock Convention, which
seeks to correctly predict the
nominee of the political party
out of the White House.

Four weeks ago the Execu-
tive Committee rescinded the
appointment of Steve Matrazzo
as the tri-chairman of the Mock
Convention in charge of
political research. There will be
no replacement.

The resignations of Len
Howard, lower-South regional
coordinator, and John Hay-
wood, facilities chairman,
followed the EC’s ruling on
Matrazzo.

The political research that

must be accomplished to
nominate the right candidate
will now fall on both chairmen’s
shoulders. Muller also is
responsible for the overseeing
of the 50 state chairmen and
fundraising while Lewis, a
senior from New Orleans, La.,
heads up the administration end
of the convention and keeps
tabs on the steering committee.

The steering committee con-
sists of several law and
undergraduate students who
chair various subcommittees.

The chairmen explained that
Jack Dent, presently upper-
South regional coordinator, will
be removed from this position
and promoted to administrative
assistant in charge of the
political responsibilities.

“He (Dent) will not hold the
authority of Matrazzo — by his
choice and ours,”’ Lewis said.

The South will now be con-
solidated under one regional
coordinator who has yet to be
named.

Both students feel that the
restructuring period that began
with the EC’s firing of Matrazzo
will not have an adverse affect
on the convention. In fact, they
are encouraged by their new
organizati

ization.

“power has been con-
solidated and the structure has
been streamlined,’’ Muller said.

“The stress that could have
remained has been eliminated
and motivation is high,’’ Lewis
explained.

“‘Morale really hasn’t taken a
beating,’ Muller added. ‘‘The
stress that we've’ been
experiencing, especially in the
last few weeks, has been from
the outside not the inside.”’

With the convention schedul-
ed for May 11 and 12, 1984, time
is fleeting for the chairmen as
they work to put on one of the
grandest weekends held at
W&L, and many people in the
W&L community wonder how
this reorganization has affected
their timetable. Both Lewis and
Muller contend that the Mock
Convention is very much on
schedule.

Muller said that concerning
some facets of the convention
they are even ahead of schedule
as at this time in 1979 the date
was not even set for the 1980
convention.

Lewis mentioned how ‘they
have been told by the W&L ad-
ministration that they are
“eons ahead” of past conven-
tions.

“The overall orgainzation
and structure is set and moving
forward. We haven’t experienc-
ed a setback. We had to stop to
re-evaluate our structure but
we haven’t taken a step back by
any means,”’ Muller said.

The chairmen keep an eye on
the progress of the convention
by holding weekly meetings
with their top officers and
assistants. They also get
together with the entire steer-
ing committee every two weeks
and satisfy their long range ob-
jectives by meeting with all the
state chairmen once a month.

Lewis and Muller have con-
tracts between themselves with
target dates and _ respon-
sibilities so they can gauge their

own progress.

Muller, president of the W&L
hockey club and co-chairman of
student recruitment commit-
tee, went to high school at Deer-
field Academy in Connecticut.
It is there that he got interested
in the idea of a mock convention
as he helped to organize the
Academy’s 1980 Republican
Mock Convention.

Lewis was also involved in
student government in high
school. He applied to W&L with

Reeves Center gains attention

Chapman emphasizes use by students

By BOB BRYANT
Staff Reporter

“I want to emphasize that the
Reeves Center is for the stu-
dent’s use,’ says Ben Chap-
man, director of student pro-
jects for the Reeves Center.

The Reeves Center for
Research and Exhibition of
Porcelain and Paintings houses
the extensive collection of
ceramics and paintings given to
Washington and Lee University
in 1967 by Mr. and Mrs. Euchlin
D. Reeves of Providence, R.I.
Located at the north end of the
Colonade in what was originally
a faculty home, the center has
been renovated and enlarged to
house the Reeves collection.

“While it is primarily. a stu-
dent research and study center,
we are engaged in a lot of P.R.
for W&L,” Chapman said. that
public relations role has includ-
ed an article in the fall issue of
Southern Accents magazine,
group tours, a pottery sym-
posium and visits from high
school art classes.

“Last year we had a great
number of people come to Lex-
ington just to see the collec-
tion,” Chapman said. ‘“‘We’ve
had groups of up to 40 or 50 peo-

ple in here at one time.”

Students have been working
with and learning from the
Reeves collection since its ar-
rival at W&L. ‘Students work-
ing at Professor McDaniel’s ar-
cheologic dig at Liberty Hall
were the first to make use of the
collection,’ according to James
W. Whitehead, Director of the
Reeves Center and former
treasurer of Washington and
Lee.

These students compared

ceramic collecting by Mr. and
Mrs. Reeves. Reeves graduated
from Washington and Lee’s law
school in 1927 and married
Louise Herreshoff, a descend-
ant of John Brown of Pro-
vidence, R.I. in 1941. Mrs.
Reeves was a prolific painter
and her work, which is part of
the collection, was discovered
by accident.

one of the workmen asked if he
wanted the old Victorian pic-
ture frames loaded on,” ex-
plains Tim McCune, a research
assistant at the center. ‘‘These
were old, dust covered black
picture frames with heavy plate
glass over them. Mr. Whitehead
decided to throw them in the
load in case they could have
been of some use to the art
department. When the collec-
tion arrived in Lexington, the
frames were cleaned off and
they discovered the beautiful
paintings underneath.” The
paintings were the subject of a
1976 one-woman show at the
Corcoran Gallery in Washing-
ton, D.C.

The major portion of the col-
lection is made up of pieces
from the major porcelain fac-
tories of England and Continen-
tal Europe, as well as mid-18th-
and early 19th-century Chinese
export porcelain. Chinese ex-
port porcelain was among the
ceramic wares designed and
manufactured specifically for
export to foreign countries, par-
ticularly Western Europe and
America. These pieces differed
substantially from domestically
manufactured porcelain, in that
the designs on the pieces were
copies of scenes of Western life
and culture provided the
Chinese artesians by traders.
“The political, social, economic
and religious scenes of the
period are all in the porcelain,”’
said Whitehead.

Chapman wants to “en-
courage everyone to come here
at least once. We’re here
basically for the students.” The
center is open weekdays from

The committee, meanwhile,
has surveyed faculty members
and department chairmen to
determine their needs in the
way of computer courses.

So far, according to Imeson,
the major point of discussion
among committee members
has been whether or not the
computer science major should
be part of the mathematics
department. However, Imeson
added, that is the last decision
the committee has to make.
They first must decide what
courses and staff is necessary.

Compared to other private
universities in the state,
Washington and Lee is “‘in a
very good position in terms of
equipment and has been for a
number of years,’’ Imeson said.
“But our course offerings, I
believe, leave a lot to be
desired.”

Washington and Lee’s math
department currently offers six
computer science courses.

The university plans a major
upgrading of the computer
system during the summer of
1985, Imeson said, including

That upgrading would provide

Imeson said the university’s
equipment is lacking only in
laboratory equipment for
students to design and build
computers.

Computer science does have a.

place in a liberal arts institution
such as W&L, Imeson said. “I
think it fits in the same way as
accounting, as journalism or as
perhaps other academic
disciplines that already exist on
campus. I think it stands as an
academic discipline on its own
two feet.

“In my mind, we would not
expect to turn out the same sort

science degrees as Carnegie-

students will not be as steeped

Wilson said he formed the

possibility of a computer
science major because ‘‘we
can’t afford to be on the
sidelines.”’

As the prices of computers
decrease, Wilson said, ‘‘most

Generals dumped by H-SC, 20-8

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee foot-
ball team’s ODAC champion-
ship hopes suffered a setback
last Saturday as the Generals
dropped a 20-8 decision to arch-
rival Hampden-Sydney.

Defense was the name of the
game as the Tigers held the
Generals’ offense to 192 total
yards and forced five turn-

overs. W&L crossed midfield

only three times and scored
their lone touchdown late in the
fourth quarter after the out-
come had already been decided.

and continue on its way toa fine
season,” head coach Gary
Fallon said.

Hampden-Sydney controlled

the first half, establishing a 13-0

half-time lead. The Tigers en-
joyed excellent field position
throughout the first two quar-
ters as a result of W&L turn-
overs.

“If our'defense hadn’t played
exceptionally well in the first
half, we could have been down
by more than 13-0 at half-time,”
Fallon said.

After a_ scoreless. third
quarter, W&L cut the deficit to
13-2 after cornerback Barry

in the first three quarters Sunday, and

Kevin Weaver, also a freshman,
covered the remaining ground,
scoring his third TD of the
season. The two-point attempt
failed, making the final score
20-8.

Quarterback Bobby Wilson
had a frustrating day, as he was
unable to complete any of his
eight attempts and threw four
interceptions.

“Bobby had the game you
hope you never get. But they
happen. Brian Sipe (Cleveland

Browns’ quarterback) threw
five interceptions in the first
three quarters Sunday, and he’s
making about $200,000 a year
more than Bobby,”’ Fallon said.
“I told him after the game just
to learn from it but not to dwell
on it. He’ll bounce back.”’

W&L travels to Sewanee,
Tenn., to take on the University
of the South this Saturday. The
Tigers are 4-2 on the year, while
the Generals’ record fell to 3-2
after last Saturday’s loss. Last
year, the Generals held a 20-7
before giving up two fourth
quarter touchdowns to lose,
21-20. Fallon believes that his
team will face a dangerous of-
fense at Sewanee.

“We expect the same sort of

explosive offense that Sewanee
demonstrated a year ago when
they came back against us,”
Fallon explained. ‘‘You never
have those people in the coffin.

And down there, I’m -not sure
there is a coffin — except the
one that visiting teams are
liable to step into.”’

In addition, Fallon believes
his team will rebound with a
strong performance this week.
“The game at Sewanee will be
an indication of what kind of
character and leadership we
have. The leadership and at-
titude have been superb all
season. I have no doubt that
they will continue,” Fallon said.

Ruggers a dedicated bunch

By PAUL CLARK
Special to the Phi

Are you looking for a sport
with the aggression of football
and the finesse of soccer? If so,
according to Spencer Dickin-
son, rugby should be your
game.

This year, with a diverse
club, Washington and Lee’s
Rugby team has improved dai-
ly. According to Dickinson, a
senior and four-year veteran of
the club, the team has made im-
mense improvement in the past
two years. In recent years in-
terest had dropped and as a

stress in the record is the ex-
perience the younger players
and the team as a whole has
gained.

One also must take into con-
sideration the status of rugby at
Washington and Lee as com-
pared to other schools. At W&L
rugby is a sport gaining respect
and participants, while at the
same time, the rugby clubs at
other schools are well establish-
ed and to a large part, entirely
funded by their respective
schools. Many of W&L’s op-
ponents have coaches and facil-
ities strictly for rugby, but the

the club by the Executive Com-
mittee.

In the face of this economic
adversity, the club has still
managed to improve during the
first half of the season. The
team started off the season by
tying neighbor VMI. Then the
team participated in the Ed Lee
Cup tournament at Pocohontas
State Park in Richmond where
they lost two very close match-
es. In the next game W&L gave
Virginia Tech, its toughest op-
ponent of the season, a hard
game but came up short. How-
ever, the experience the team
gained from the first four mat-
ches enabled them to whip
U.Va. 15-3. The confidence gain-
ed from beating such a large
school as Virginia has given the
team high hopes for finishing
the season with a winning
record.

The team will put its ex-
perience on the line this
weekend against Longwood Col-
lege at Longwood, after which
they will play two more match-
es before culminating the
season at home against arch-
rival Hampden-Sydney on Nov.
12.

All fans are encouraged to
come to the remaining home
games against North Grounds
RFC on Nov. 5, and the H-SC
game the next weekend. In ad-
dition, says Dickinson, ‘‘any
student interested in doing a lit-
tle conditioning or learning
about the game as they play is
encouraged to join the team.”’

New SID named

By PETER WRIGHT
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee has nam-
ed Mark Mandel, former Sports
Information Director at
Worcester Polytech Institute,
as its new SID after Ken Ries
left W&L in September.

Mandel, who according to
W&L News Services Director
Jeff Hanna was chosen from an
applicant pool of 35, will begin
work in the SID office in
November.

Hanna said Mandel was at-
tracted to W&L because it of-
fers him a better opportunity.

‘Washington and Lee has the
best Division III sports infor-
mation office in the country,”
Hanna said. ‘‘I’ll be surprised if
he (Mandel) is not really good,”
he said.

Mandel, who has been the SID
at WPI for five years, is
familiar with Division III
philosophy and has had the ad-
vantage of running his own pro-
gram there, Hanna said. Hav-

ing the necessary background
in dealing with athletes,
coaches and the media is ex-
tremely important, Hanna said.

Mandel, who has an under-
graduate and a Masters degree
from Syracuse University,
replaces Ken Ries who moved
on to become the SID at James
Madison University. Ries had
been SID since 1979.

“Ken was superb — that’s
why he got the job he did,”’ Han-
na said. Ries had won numerous
awards from the College Sports
Information Directors Associa-
tion for his press releases.
“There is no question,
everybody hates to see him
go...he did such a super job,”
stated Hanna. Ries replaces
Richard Murray at J.M.U. who
will, in turn, become the new
S.I1.D. at the University of
Virginia.

Since Ries’ departure, sports
news has been handled by Han-
na and W&L senior Marty
Bechtold.

lustrative of just how far gone
he is are mac’s post-match

where is good old poetic justice
when you need it). He said to
the effect that 1) the suspension
would do him good, he needed
the layoff; and 2) if he had
known that he was going to be

on a show. Before, I could
tolerate his trying to argue his
point. But now it seems that
we’ve got argument for argu-
ment’s sake. Gee, john, why not
just get your own TV series and
let someone who is interested in
playing tennis take your place...

the college football world,
another argument against bowl

Texas and Nebraska should be
able to meet in some sort of
championship, but given bowl
contracts, the two would end up
in different bowls. (Texas as
Southwest Conference Cham-

_ pion would go to the Cotton

Orange Bowl.) But hey, what’s

Soccer out of contention

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee soc-
cer team dropped two away
games to strong opponents this
week, effectively ruining their
chances for NCAA and VISA
(Virginia Intercollegiate Soccer
Association) playoff berths, ac-
cording to head coach Rolf
Piranian.

The Generals lost to the Get-
tysburg Bullets on Saturday,
10, and to the Lynchburg
Hornets yesterday, 2-1.

“We're out of the picture.
We’re playing for pride now,”’
said Piranian. The Generals are
already out of the race for the
ODAC title.

The Generals opened the
scoring against Lynchburg ten
minutes into the game, as soph-
omore forward Bill Holmes got
his fourth goal of the season, ty-
ing senior co-captain Roland
Simon for the team goal scoring
lead. Simon, who scored a goal

in each of the first three games
of the season, has one goal in
the last six games. All four of
Holmes’ goals have come in the
last four games.

The Hornets scored their two
goals later in the first half, leav-
ing a 2-1 halftime and final
score.

The Hornets outshot the
Generals, 6-4, for the game.
Piranian cited his team’s poor
shooting and the flow of the
game for the low shot total.
“The game was pretty much
played at midfield,” said Pira-
nian.

The Generals played 82
scoreless minutes against a
physical Gettysburg team
before what Piranian called a
“dubious” handball call gave
the Bullets a penalty kick with
eight minutes left, which they
converted for the only goal of
the game.

The physical play of the
Bullets was a contributing fac-

tor in holding the Generals
scoreless for the first time this
season. ‘‘It got more and more
physical as the game went on,”
commented Piranian. ‘‘I got the
feeling that Gettysburg wanted
to play us that way.”

About the Bullets’ penalty
kick, Piranian noted, ‘‘There
were a couple of situations
where we felt they (the
referees) could have given us
penalty kicks.”

Piranian commended the
play of freshman midfielder
Ken Randby, who was named
Player of the Game. ‘‘He did a
super job defensively and offen-
sively,’’ said the eighth-year
coach.

“We know we've got the
talent out there,” said Piranian.
“We just have to take more
shots and get the job done.”’

The Generals have only one
game next week, a 2 p.m. match
Saturday with Hampden-
Sydney on Wilson Field.

Polo wins one at Invite

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
water polo team won one game
and lost three last weekend in
the Southeast Varsity Invita-
tional at Annapolis, Md. The
Generals collected a victory
against George Washington
University, but lost games to
Brown, Harvard and Bucknell.

Commenting on the Generals’
performance, assistant water
polo coach Bob Newcomb said,
“We played relatively poorly
against Brown.” Concerning
the Generals’ 6-5 loss to Har-
vard, Coach Newcomb said,
‘“‘Harvard was our best game.
We should have won. We led
most of the game.”’

He continued, ‘Nobody ex-
pected us to play that well ex-
cept us.”

According to Newcomb, W&L
displayed a very good counter
attack (the transition from of-
fense to defense), but they
made a lot of bad passes on of-

     
   
      
    
   

Visa

 

fense.

Kevin Kadesky, senior goalie,
had a very busy weekend.
Following an interview with the
University of Texas Medical
School on Friday, Kadesky
traveled to Annapolis for W&L’s
last two games of the tourna-
ment.

“Kevin Kadesky played
outstanding games. He played
extremely well,” said Coach
Newcomb.

Coach Newcomb also cited
freshman Dan Trice for playing
very good defense.

An important aspect of the
Generals’ participation in the
Southeast Varsity Invitational
is that W&L now has the oppor-
tunity to note any improvement
that they may have made since
they last played “‘top ten’ com-
petition. The Generals last en-
counter against “top ten’’ com-
petition was in the Northeast
Varsity Invitational at Brown
on Sept. 23, 24 and 25. Coach
Newcomb said, ‘We are play-
ing much better. We are not

making as many careless
mistakes as we used to and our
defense is much better.’’

. Newcomb, however, said, ‘““We

cannot generate any offense.”’

The Generals hope to gener-
ate a lot of offense this weekend
when they participate in the
Southern League Tournament
in Richmond, Va. The tourna-
ment will be played on Oct. 21,
22. and 23. W&L is scheduled to
play against Richmond,
Hampden-Sydney, Virginia
Commonwealth University and
the University of North
Carolina at Wilmington.

The W&L-Richmond game
will be the highlight of the
weekend. The Generals hope to
avenge an early season loss to
Richmond. According to Coach
Newcomb, Richmond is playing
good water polo. “The game
will be an indication of how
much we have improved since
the beginning of the season,’’
said Newcomb.

He concluded, ‘“‘It should be a
very good game.”’

McBryde paces harriers
to fifth place finish

By RICK PIERCE
Staff Reporter

This past weekend the
Washington and Lee harriers
competed in the Virginia State
Meet and placed fifth among 13
institutions. The Generals, run-
ning on their home course, fell
victim to an off day. Coach Dick
Miller commented, ‘‘We did not
run well and did not improve
our perfromances sufficiently
enough to win.’’ Although the
Generals ran without Paul
Chapman, Coach Miller said he
is not making any excuses.

Liberty Baptist and Radford
University placed first and se-
cond respectively in the meet.
These schools represented the
Division II powers in Virginia.

   

Christopher Newport College
and Roanoke College took the
laurels in Division III ahead of
W&L.

This week the Generals will
travel north to take on Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
foe, Bridgewater College, along
with West Virginia Tech and
Newport News Apprentice
School. The chances look good
for the Generals to improve on
their 7-1 record as W&L placed
ahead of Bridgewater this past
weekend.

Coach Miller noted, ‘‘We are
looking forward to the ODAC
meet in defending our title. Our
biggest challenge will probably
be Roanoke, but we are taking
one meet at a time.”’

Letter

 

(continued from page 2)

cited much debate among the
students, faculty, and adminis-
tration. Unfortunately, most of
this debate has been very super-
ficial. Sexist slogans, such as,
‘Girls in the hay, but not every-
‘day,’’ can only aid those who
support coeducation. It is time
for W&L to meet the real world.
By suggesting that women may
be incapable of reacting to the
inspiration of Robert E. Lee,
Jenevein has stereotyped the
entire: undergraduate student
body as male chauvinists. The
jokes about male chauvinism
are fun until you realize that
they aren’t jokes anymore.

We are just fooling ourselves
if we say we must go coed be-
cause of financial reasons or ad-
missions. W&L has the re-
sources in its alumni organi-
zation and endowment to re-
main single sex and fiscally
secure. The millions that would
be spent on the renovation of the
university could be used to in-
crease the endowment. We can
make it through a few lean
years if we have to lower the
size of our undergraduate
classes. There is no reason to
consider lowering admissions
standards. The drop in applica-
tions need not be so drastic.
West of the Mississippi W&L is
almost. unknown. There are
thousands of prospective
students that never hear of
W&L. Scott Mason and Ian Ban-
well were incorrect in their
assessments of the coeducation
issue in last week’s Ring-tum
Phi. If we go coed, it must be for
the right reasons — ethical
reasons. Do women have the
right to attend one of the finest
— if not the finest — liberal arts
colleges in the nation?

The decision will be made by
the Board of Trustees next
Spring. It is worth asking if the
trustees are really in touch with
the university. With the excep-
tion of President Wilson, none
live in Lexington. They will pro-
bably be most influenced by
John Delane Wilson who has not
yet finished his freshman year
as President. :

Washington and Lee has a
tremendous obligation to the
future generations of students.
This is the only liberal arts col-
lege of high academic standing
that offers young men a single
sex environment. If W&L were
to go coed, the options left to the
male high school seniors would
become very restricted.

Finally, if there are any
doubts about coeducation, we
must remain all-male. We can
always go coed, but we can
never go back!

The student body has reason
to feel helpless in this situation.
The faculty and administration
have a history of making deci-
sions without student input.
President Wilson, by encourag-
ing the issue of coeducation, has
allowed himself to become
alienated from the students

before he really had a chance to
find out what student life is like.

One of President Wilson’s
most recent faux pas occurred

when he addressed a meeting of
the Interfraternity Council. He
allowed himself to be drawn in-
to a debate by appearing to in-
dict the fraternity system for
the faults in our unique and
perhaps’ perverse social
system. The I.F.C. responded
with a near unanimous attack

on what were good intentions on
the part of President Wilson.

This was a typical reaction in
what is the tendency to blame
fraternities for most of our pro-
blems. Students at the
surrounding ‘‘women’s_ col-
leges.’’ must shoulder much of
the responsibility for our lack of
social graces. They encourage
the “‘meat market”’ fraternity-
type party, never failing to
show up every Tuesday,
Wednesday, Friday and Satur-
day night, often drunker than
any minks. One of the advan-
tages of coeducation, and a sure
cure for male chauvinism,
would be to have some smarter
women around.

At the aforementioned I.F.C.
meeting it was agreed that
there are problems with Rush,
fraternity-community rela-
tions, and the physical deteri-
oration of the houses. Instead of
starting any direct motion such

as a committee to revise our ob-
solete system of Rush, I.F.C.
President Emery Ellinger an-
nounced the formation of a
‘“‘Committee for Self-
Improvement.’’ Just what the
duties of this committee are is
unclear. It will be interesting to
see if they accomplish anything
of value.

Joseph Cadle must be com-
mended for his letter to the
Ring-tum Phi last week. He hit

home on every point but one,

Homecoming. Any group may
nominate someone for Home-
coming Queen. Intervarsity,
SABU and others had the oppor-
tunity, but did not make the ef-
fort to show up for the inter-
views.

For the first time in our few
short years at W&L, the student
body is excited. Whether we go
coed or not, we have an oppor-

In support of coeducation

To the Editors:

First I'd like to sincerely
thank Joseph Cadle for elo-
quently voicing the opinions on
fraternities so many of us have
wanted to express for so long.

Now to the issue of coeduca-
tion: W&L should stay all male
because it is a tradition. Well
bloodletting for medicinal pur-

poses was a tradition for more
than 300 years. The tradition of
human slavery dates back past
the building of the great

pyramids of Egypt. The tradi-
tion argument is baloney, and
those arguing it should consider
trading in their Volvos for a
horse and buggy. There looms a
heterogeneous world out there,
and it is simply archaic to at-

tempt to prepare modern young
men for a career in that modern
world while subjecting them to
an all male academic at-
mosphere that has changed lit-
tle this century.

“Unique,” that’s the word
Bob Jenevein used. The dic-
tionary reads, ‘‘being the only
one of it’s kind; solitary; sole.”’
Did you hear that VMI? Half of
those people on the parade
ground are really women!
Perhaps that explains the re-
cent performance of the Keydet
football team.

There are, at last count, five
all male institutions of higher
education in the United States,
two here in Lexington. Not only

aren’t we unique, we're not
even unique in Rockbridge
County!

The social atmosphere here is
totally unnatural, yet I hear
complaints to the effect that
women would be distracting in
class, that women would re-
mind men during the week of
their failures the previous
weekends. Mature adults must
learn to live and coexist on such
a basis. Why not mature under
such conditions, rather than be

thrust into it upon graduation.
When a W&L graduate finds
himself the subordinate of a
woman, I hope he doesn’t
classify her as something that
used to arrive Friday nights,
five to a BMW. Can you picture
Sandra Day O’Connor driving
for an hour in anticipation of
having grain punch spilled on
her while someone slurs ‘‘Whar-
dyagotaschool?”
Those in favor of the status
quo are living in a rich man’s

tunity to change W&L for the
better — if we can keep up the
level of student interest. The
Ring-tum Phi and President
John D. Wilson are two poten-
tial leaders in this change. We

can introduce W&L to the real ~

world.

dream world. If they truely love
W&L and want it to survive as a
fine academic institution first,
and a social club second, then
the statistics are all the persua-
sion they should need. Robert
E. Lee took this university and
turned it around. He dramati-
cally expanded the curriculum,
and took the unheard of step of
abolishing manditory daily
chapel. It is time for a change;
Lee would approve.

ODK responds to criticism

To the Editors:

In the October 13 issue of the
Ring-tum Phi, Joseph Cadle ex-
pressed his views on fraternity
influence at Washington and
Lee (“Fraternity Influences
Too Much on the Hill?’”’) In do-
ing so, he cited the criteria for
membership in the Alpha Circle
of Omicron Delta Kappa leader-
ship fraternity as being part of
a situation that is ‘‘just plain
sad.”’ He stated, ‘One of the
categories amidst its (ODK’s)
criteria is labelled ‘social.’ ”
Then he went on to ask, ‘‘Now
how does one cultivate social
leadership skills at W&L if one
is not in a fraternity?”’

To answer Mr. Cadle’s ques-
tion, let me begin by saying that
there are five major ‘‘phases”’
of campus life in which, accord-
ing to the General Council of
ODK, achievement should be

recognized, one of which is
given the heading ‘‘Social, ser-
vice, and religious activities,
and campus government.”’ The
Council suggests that when the
circle attempts to recognize
leaders in this particular
“phase’’ of college life, it should
consider the following: Presi-
dents of campus government
bodies; president of Student Ac-
tivities Board, Presidents of
Junior and Senior Classes;
Presidents of student religious
associations; chairpersons of
big weekend committees;
heads of other major campus-
wide activities or organizations.
Election to membership is on
the basis of merit and irrespec-
tive of a person’s affiliation
with other organizations.
Clearly, then, there are many
ways that one can cultivate
social leadership skills at W&L

without being in a fraternity;
one can, without having frater-
nity membership as a prere-
quisite, set an example through
social cooperation with and in-
terdependence upon various
campus groups.

While I support Mr. Cadle’s
right to publicly express his
views on what he considers to
be a disturbing and shameful
situation at W&L, I must object
to his generalization. The
fraternity system at W&L may
be influential but not enough to
seriously impede an indepen-
dent’s cultivation of superior
social leadership skills. And
finally, may I add that I certain-
ly hope that the Alpha Circle
would not disregard such
achievement.

VOLUME 83

 

NUMBER7

for 3 years by SAC

By JOHN CLEGHORN
Chief Editor

The Student Affairs Commit-
tee voted Monday to suspend a
Washington and Lee student
convicted on drug charges for
three years, extending a one-
year suspension recommenda-
tion by the Student Control
Committee, according to Dean
of Students and SAC Chairman
Lewis John.

Thomas J. Rohrig, a W&L
senior at the time, was con-
victed Sept. 9 on charges of sell-
ing marijuana and possession of
marijuana with intent to sell.

Rohrig’s case, which is still
under study by officials of the
Rockbridge Circuit Court in a
pre-sentence examination, was
brought to the university’s at-
tention upon his arrest last
spring, Dean John said.

The SAC, which is composed
of undergraduate class
presidents and vice-presidents
and law school class presidents,
followed normal procedure in
using the facts presented in
Rohrig’s court trial in its judg-
ment of the case.

At its Oct. 18 meeting, the
SCC voted unanimously to sus-
pend Rohrig for one year.
Under university regulations,
any recommendation for sus-
pension or expulsion must be
reviewed by the SAC which is a
student-faculty body.

The SAC met Monday and
voted to override the SCC rec-
commendation and suspend
Rohrig for three years effective
immediately. He will be eligible
to apply for re-entrance in
September, 1986, Dean John
said. Rohrig will be officially
withdrawn from the university
until that time.

Dean John explained that
each case of suspension heard
by the SAC. is treated. indi-

vidually.

“There are certainly no
automatic penalties resulting
from any particular charge,”
Dean John said. ‘‘Each case is
considered individually accor-
ding to the facts and cir-
cumstances,’ he said.

The members of the SAC are;
Dean John (Chairman), Dan
Murphy, assistant dean of
students, Professor H. Laurent
Boetsch, Professor John M.
Evans, Marshall K. Follo, Bob
Jenevein, Emery Ellinger, Tim
Schurr, Kelly Wrenn and
Charlie Alcorn.

The W&L Student Activities
Board will launch its revamped

clude a two-band party Friday
night in Doremus Gym and a se-

Friday night’s festivities will

begin the weekend with two
bands that will appeal to a wide
variety of taste. Doremus Gym
(the old gym) will feature The
Grandeurs and the Dads. The
doors will open at 8 p.m. and
proper identification is re-
quired. The bands will begin
their sets around 9. Refresh-
ments will be served on the up-

per level balcony (25* or 5 for a

dollar). The SAB has con-
structed one large stage on
which both bands will set up
their equipment. The two bands

Letters to the Editors Student wants W&L unique

Coeducation will help

remove Minks’ masks

To the Editors:

In spite of the large quantity
of nonsense that has been ut-
tered recently, some warm con-
gratulations are in order. To
Scott Tilley for his plea for in-
tellectual debate on coeduca-
tion. To Jim Murphy and Scott
Stockburger for some of their
insights into the issue. To Joe
Cadle and Pete Whitehead for
daring to take the risks of voic-
ing unpopular opinions. And
lastly to Markham Pyle for pro-
ving once again that the spirit of
Archie Bunker is alive and well
in the good ol’ U.S. of A. I spoke
of risks. On a campus this size,
one cannot possibly remain
anonymous. Those dissenters
who have not already been out-
cast risk being ostracized for
not *follwoing the status quo.
Heaven forbid that anyone out
of the mainstream should be
allowed to represent or help to
better the school.

My approach to the issue of
coeducation is quite different
from that of most students. I try
to view it from an intellectual
and human outlook. I am speak-
ing from my head and my
heart, not from my emotions
and my glands. Therefore, this
letter is addressed primarily to
those who are either undecided,
or willing to listen to discussion
on the issue.

The first thing one must look
at when considering university
policy is the purpose of institu-
tions of higher learning. While
many choose to look to the
future, or listen to the voice of
tradition, I feel these must be
secondary to the concerns of the
present and to the guiding prin-
ciples of education. The purpose
of a university is three-fold: to.
achieve a greater intellectual
capacity, to learn about oneself
and to learn how to live with
others.

The academic level of
Washington and Lee is com-
paratively high, but that does
not mean it cannot be improv-
ed. The faculty took a large step
forward in this regard last year
when it increased the distribu-
tion requirements, but this is
not enough. Intellectual pursuit
must take place outside the
classroom as well. When was
the last time you heard an
ideological discussion or debate
outside the classroom? Most
conversations deal with either
social activities or how to juggle
them with academic require-
ments. Of necessity, the all-
male atmosphere has complete-
ly separated the social world
from the academic world, and
this separation leads to conflict.
Unless the two can be melded
together somehow, there will

always be serious conflicts and

choices to be made between the
two. This can only be achieved
by coeducation.

The second purpose of the
university is for the student to
learn about himself. For the
first time in his life, the student
is thrown in with multitudes of
people with differing back-
grounds and values, and he
must shape his opinions without
parental assistance. He must
discover who he really is, and
how he really feels about things.
How can he decide if he must be
constantly changing masks?
Granted, at any school there
will be the two worlds of
academics and non-academics
that must be faced differently,
but this is heightened at W&L as
I explained earlier. In fact,
three separate roles must be
played here. There is the stu-
dent who is trying to do well in
class. There is the guy who is
trying to establish a certain
relationship with the other guys
on campus. There is the male
who must act quickly and
decisively with the females
since there is not enough time to
let a relationship grow natural-
ly. How can a person find his
true self if he must be three peo-
ple? While not a complete cure,
coeducation could limit this to
two which are somewhat linked.

Thirdly, universities are for
learning how to live with other
people. Despite popular belief,
girls are people too; and those
who don’t believe it will have to
face this reality eventually. An
all-male _ institution auto-
matically cuts this function in
half. So often we grow depress-
ed by life and need the comfort
of a gentle embrace —someone
physically saying ‘‘I care and
I’m rooting for you.” Social con-
vention prevents this between
males. What our education
lacks is human love and com-
passion, and learning ways to
help each other survive. This
can be learned only by ex-
perience — not from a textbook
or a philosophical essay.

For these reasons, I whole-
heartedly support coeducation.
I would like to conclude this let-
ter with a challenge to all
students. Figure out why you
feel the way you do about
coeducation (or anything else
for that matter) and let people
know what you come up with.
Write it down —or better yet,
talk to each other. If you should
feel like some serious conversa-
tion, I’m always willing and
easy to spot. Just look for the
guy with the long hair and a six-
week beard who is wearing a
ridiculous shirt.

Larry Butler
Class of ’84

To the Editors:

I would first like to commend
Joseph Cadle on his incredible
letter of two weeks ago that
outlined the bias that in-
dependents are subject to at
this university. His letter ad-
dressed a very real problem
faced by W&L if it is to remain
the fine institution it is.

This letter does the same
thing, but the problem it deals
with is much more urgent.

As the eloquent Markham
Pyle noted last week, the threat
of coeducation requires all our
action. In this light I address
the proponents of coeducation,
particularly Mr. N.P. White-
head, whose letter also ap-
peared last week.

Mr. Whitehead contends that
“the social problem here is
totally unnatural.’’ Well, of
course it is. At no other time in
your life will you be given the
choice of five different parties
to attend every Friday and
Saturday night, with free drink
and entertainment provided.
This is because college life itself
is unnatural, and it is even more
unnatural at coed colleges,
where for four years you live
within walking distance of a
dormitory full of unmarried
females your age.

Of course the social at-
mosphere here is unnatural.
But going coed will not change
it one bit: The same girls will
still be at the same parties.
Much-needed attempts to clean
up the social atmosphere are
being made by President Wil-
son with the IFC, and it is in this
area only that changes can be
made.

At an all male school one
realizes that he must be outgo-
ing and social in order to meet
girls. W&L teaches its students
a lesson and a skill in this
respect that they would never
gain if they were able to take for
granted that women would
always be right there. When
men graduate from college
there won’t be a dorm full of un-
married females right next
door — they will have to go out
and find them. And I think it is
those students who have failed
to mature socially who would
have us go coed. They want
girls living just down the street
or in the hall upstairs because
they can’t cope in the social
world.

And when I say social world,
please, Mr. Whitehead, don’t
conjure up that irrational and
very tiresome image of a W&L
man dragging somebody’s
screaming daughter up the
stairs and nailing her to a bed.
This myth is only perpetuated
by sarcastic letters like yours
and Mr. Cadle’s. If you do not
like this type of behavior (as I
don’t), then avoid the people ex-
hibiting it. The majority of
social gathering places on cam-
pus don’t display this type of
behavior.

Yes, Mr. Whitehead, ‘‘uni-

que”’ — that’s the word Bob
Jenevein used. And here is the
sentence that Bob Jenevein us-
ed: ‘It seems that many at the
school believe the all-male
status has quite a lot to do with
the uniqueness of the institu-
tion; and that to remove that
would be to transform the in-
stitution into something it has
never been and to destroy what
was.”’ Now I defy you, Mr.
Whitehead, to suggest
—seriously this time — that
W&L is not a unique school. Of
the many colleges that offer an
outstanding liberal arts educa-
tion, W&L is the only one that is
all-male, so taking away the all-
male status would mean that
W&L would no longer be unique.
Taking Mr. Jevenein’s word out
of context Mr. Whitehead tried
to suggest that W&L isn’t even
unique in Rockbridge County
because VMI is all-male also.
Now isn’t it a little ridiculous to

To the Editors:

Mr. Pyle’s editorial, which I
had the opportunity to see on a
visit to W&L last week, is the
same argument made by stu-
dents (and administrators) in
the ’60s against integration
—‘they have other choices..”
This is not a reason to avoid
coeducation, it has always
simply been an excuse to main-
tain a (white) Anglo-saxon pro-
testant male supremacy. Be-
tween each of the lines is the
real fear — that ‘“‘they,” in this
case women, may change an

suggest that VMI and W&L are
identical? W&L is unique in the
world.

Yes, Mr. Whitehead, I even
read the unedited version of
your letter that was tacked to
the Colonnade. I read it ‘“‘the
way it was written, before it
reached the editors of the Ring-
tum Phi,”’ and I counted twelve
grammatical errors, five spell-
ing errors, and one sentence
that was completely incom-
prehensible. Consider yourself
lucky that the Phi editors left
some bits out and even cor-
rected the spelling of our Mr.
Cadle’s name.

For those of you who don’t
read grafitti, Mr. Whitehead ex-
plained in the unedited version
that when he came to W&L,
“the fact that it is all-male oc-
cupied a space low on my list of
priorities.”” But now that he’s
here, it seems, he doesn’t like it,

come to like; we’re on top and
want to stay there as long as

“they” may prove true our
greatest fear —they may see
through us or be smarter than
us, or do better than us, or re-
ject US! They may put us on
equal footing with them so that
we have to prove our ability not
have it taken for granted.

The safest solution is don’t
give them the chance. Hang in

Exhaustive, disoriented,
and hate-mongering

To the Editors:

It is not often I find myself
compelled to reply to letters to
the editor, but the irrational
epistle of Messrs. Stockburger
& Murphy of 20 October bids me
to take up my pen.

In one exhaustively long,
disoriented and hate-mongering
letter, Messrs. S. & M. vilified:
Bob Jenevein, Charlie Alcorn,
Scott Mason, Ian Banwell,
President Wilson, Emery Ell-
inger, the Interfraternity Coun-
cil, the Executive Committee,
Student Control Committee,
and young ladies from “the sur-
rounding women’s colleges.” (I
apologize to any other person or
group who felt insulted, but I

tired in my attempt to make a
complete list.)

Let us first consider the peo-
ple who are so heinous in the
eyes of Messrs. S. & M. The
preeminent crime all these
folks share is their love and con-
cern for Washington and Lee.
The student body knows of the
competence, skill, and self-
sacrificing attitude of these
gentlemen in their constant
striving to enable Washington
and Lee to be the best it can be.
W&L was built by the fruits of
similarly minded men as these,
and has continued to prosper
because W&L renews this

CBS blunder imperils free

 

Gentlemen don’t

press and fair trial rights

By CLARK R. MOLLENHOFF

In broadcasting the De
Lorean tapes on October 23,
1983, CBS officials have stirred
a new storm on the Free Press-
Fair Trial issue in a manner
that does nothing but cast the
press ina bad light.

The short term damage is bad
enough in the waste of govern-
ment money and time in delay
of the trial of automaker John
Z. De Lorean on charges of traf-
ficking in cocaine.

United States District Judge
Robert Takasugi properly
postponed the criminal trial
scheduled for Nov. 1, and says:
he will not even try to set a new
trial date until at least Nov. 8
when he can assess the impact
of the CBS television broadcast
of De Lorean examining a suit-
case purportedly containing co-
caine.

Howard Weitzman, an at-
torney for De Lorean, said ‘lI
don’t think he (De Lorean) can
ever receive a fair trial.”

Because of the broadcast and
rebroadcast of the videotape of
De Lorean with the suitcase and
his arrest by FBI agents, Weitz-
man has an arguable point
because important evidence
dealing with his client’s guilt
was broadcast nationally on
CBS, and news items relative to
the content and the broadcast of
those tapes have been in news-
papers and newsmagazines
from coast to coast.

Prior to the broadcast of
those videotapes, CBS was
aware of the arguments of
lawyers for the prosecution and
for the defense that airing of
those tapes would make it im-

possible for the criminal trial to
start on Nov. 1, as scheduled —
only a week and one day after
the CBS broadcast.

Judge Takasugi had properly
warned lawyers for the govern-
ment and the prosecution of the
necessity of avoiding broadcast
of the tapes or distribution of
other potentially inflamatory
evidence that could con-
taminate the panel from which
the trial jury was to be selected.

That responsibility was im-
posed upon the trial court by the
Supreme Court in its ruling that
upset a murder conviction on
grounds that a trial judge in
Cleveland had permitted a cir-
cus atmosphere in the court-
room and the press had publish-
ed inflammatory news stories
and editorials that made it im-
possible for the defendant to get
a fair trial.

While accepting the First
Amendment rights of a free
press to publish freely what
took place in court, the
Supreme Court stated that the
trial court had the responsibili-
ty to maintain a proper at-
mosphere in court and to im-
pose specific restraints on
police officers, witnesses, and
counsel for both sides to prevent
publication or broadcast of in-
formation that might inflame
and prejudice potential jurors.

It was under the decisions of
the Supreme Court in the Dr.
Samuel Sheppard case and
subsequent decisions that
Judge Takasugi acted in seek-
ing to protect the judicial pro-
cess in ordering CBS not to
broadcast the FBI videotapes it
had obtained from Larry Flynt,

publisher of Hustler magazine.
Flynt confirmed that he had
purchased the De Lorean tapes
from a man who represented
himself as a ‘government
agent.”’

Although Judge Takasugi’s
order was entered for the pro-
per purpose of blocking publica-
tion of FBI tapes that had been
illegally and improperly obtain-
ed through prosecution. or
defense lawyers, CBS lawyers
found a way to circumvent
Judge Takasugi’s protective
order.

The Supreme Court in the
“Pentagon Papers’’ case had
ruled that the First Amendment
rights of the press barred any
“prior restraint” upon publica-
tion or broadcast unless there
was a demonstrated clear and
present danger of a catas-

trophic national security
disclosure.
Arguing that the First

Amendment decisions barred
any imposition of prior
restraint, CBS appealed Judge
Takasugi’s order to a panel of
the Ninth Circuit Court of Ap-
peals. That court’s ruling that
the De Lorean tapes could be
aired by CBS was not in any
sense an approval of CBS’s
broadcasting of the ill-gotten
tapes. It was a ruling that under
existing rulings of the United
States Supreme Court that the
courts do not have the authority
to interfere with a broadcast
unless it can be demonstrated
that there will be catastrophic
national security consequences.

Although the prosecution ap-
pealed to the United States
Supreme Court, Justice William

By BEN HALE

I’ll borrow a line from Andy
Rooney to start this off: Do you
know what makes me mad?

Some people actually enjoy
writing on the doors of the
library elevators. I find it very
hard to understand why or how
a Washington and Lee student
can, in good conscience, deface
a public area — in the library of
all places. I think most W&L
students enjoy telling their
friends at large, regulated
schools how we have no rules —
except that we are expected to
be honorable gentlemen at all
times. This public and some-
times crude grafitti certainly
speaks well of our ‘honorable
gentlemen.”’

Our loosely defined honor
system, which is one of the
strongest in the country, il-
lustrates perfectly that at W&L
we expect more of each other
than at ordinary schools. A lot
of the talk against coeducation
centers around the conviction
that W&L is special — a
gentleman’s college.

It seems to me that those who

 

write on the walls

 

 

write on elevator doors are do-
ing their best to display
Washington and Lee as near in
character and mind level to a
bush-league, juvenile delin-
quent center. I recently heard a
professor refer to W&L students
as “‘a chosen group.”’ This is a
nice thought — which is
destroyed with one trip down
the elevator. It is a shame when

My View

student recruitment tours use
the stairs to avoid letting the
parents of prospective students
see the broad evidence that
honor, pride, and tradition
aren’t as important as we claim
they are.

I realize that this complaint
applies to a few low-lifes. So, to
you I say — please keep grafitti
on fraternity bathroom walls or
in your own pitiable minds
—but, not in a public place
where it misrepresents the en-
tire university.

 

 

Rehnquist and Chief Justice
Warren Burger refused to in-
tercede and stop the broadcast.
Again, it would be incorrect to
state that either Chief Justice
Burger or Justice Rehnquist
“‘approved”’ of CBS_ broad-
casting the De Lorean tapes.
They were simply demonstrat-
ing a restraint on the power of
the court at a time when CBS
was pushing its rights to the
point where it was disregarding
the Sixth Amendment rights of

De Lorean to a fair and speedy
trial, and the rights of the
government toa fair trial.

In exercising its right to
broadcast the ill-gotten tapes,
CBS officials gave no detailed
explanation for the decision
that would obviously permeate
the airwaves with inflam-
matory and highly prejudicial
information. It was explained to
the New York Times by Ed
Joyce, the president of CBS

Phi seeks to solve circulation mystery

By SCOTT MASON

“It’s a rip off,’’ the student
said tossing aside the sheet of
paper which at the top read
“Ring-tum Phi Subscriptions”’
in bold letters.

A lot of students may have
had the same feeling seven
weeks ago when they passed the
Ring-tum Phi table near the end
of the matriculation line.
Parents whose sons signed
them up last year for a Phi
subscription rarely got the
paper despite paying the $12
subscription fee.

This year the fee has been
raised to $14. That, combined
with the apparent inefficiency
of the Phi last year in getting
issues mailed to subscribers
may have deterred many
parents from subscribing this
year. They’ve learned their
lesson. No longer, it appears,
are they going to be suckered by
the Ring-tum Phi out of Phis
they pay for but never get.

The problem last year was

with the circulation manager,
current chief editors Rick
Swagler and John Cleghorn
said. A lot of times he never
took the Ring-tum Phis to the
Post Office to be mailed.

He’d let the papers pile up.
When he finally got around to
delivering them to the Post Of-
fice, he’d take about three or
four issues at a time, Swagler
said. Consequently, when
parents did get copies of the
Phi, they were already several
weeks old.

Reader’s

Advocate

 

The circulation manager quit
in the middle of last year.
“There was just no incentive for
him to do his job,’’ Cleghorn
said. “The papers come in from
press Thursday afternoon. That
means sitting up half the night

folding, stapling, and stamping
some 300 papers so that they’re
ready to go to the Post Office
Friday morning.

Although there have been a
few complaints by subscribers
this year, the Phi thinks it’s got
the problem pretty well in
hand...well, almost anyway.

This year under Circulation
Manager Todd Barstow, the
Phis are getting to the Lex-
ington Post Office promptly
Friday morning. Barstow and a
team of helpers prepare the
paper for mailing Thursday
night.

But it seems only half the pro-
blem has been solved. No one in
the Phi office appears really
quite sure what happens to the
Phis once they’re dropped off at
the post office. At that point, it’s
out of their hands.

The post office is responsible
for seeing that the papers are
mailed on time, Barstow said.
The Ring-tum Phi isn’t to blame
if they don’t reach the sub-
scribers.

“There’s nothing I can do
about it once they get to the post
office,” Barstow said. ‘‘It’s not
our fault. We deliver them as
soon as we can. From then on,
it’s up to the post office.”

But the post office claims that
it’s been mailing the papers
almost immediately after
they’re delivered Friday.
“They’re normally mailed the
same day or the next day,”
Harry Lewis, superintendent of
postal operations in Lexington
said.

About 375 Ring-tum Phis a
week are mailed under a third
ciass permit which the Phi pays
the Lexington post office.

But the Phis don’t go straight
to the subscribers. The whole
bundle is put in one bag and sent
to a post office in Northern
Virginia, Lewis said.

“It’s a mystery what happens
to the papers there or if in fact
they ever reach that point.”

Normally if all goes well, if all
the addresses are correct, if the

papers are sent from Lexington
and mailed from Northern
Virginia to the subscribers, the
long-awaited Phis will finally
arrive at their proper destina-
tions. It’ll take only a few days
if the Ring-tum Phis are going
to parents whg live in-state.
Outside Virginia, it can take as
long as a week and a half, ac-
cording to Lewis.

All this means that the
system whereby Ring-tum Phis
are mailed to subscribers may
not be as good as it should be.
' After all, parents are paying for
the campus newspaper, and
they should get it and get it on
time. But right now there
doesn’t seem to be too many op-
tions. And, judging from the few
complaints registered by sub-

scribers this year, the Ring-tum
Phi may have ironed out its pro-
blems enough to satisfy its
customers. What was last
year’s rip off may now be a $14
bargain.
 

 

Committee considers dropping spring term

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

Faculty discontent with
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s six-week spring semester
has led to formation of a
faculty-student committee to
determine if the spring
semester should be dropped
from the school’s under-
graduate calendar.

Eight professors were ap-
pointed to the committee by
University President John D.
Wilson and two students by the
Executive Committee of the
student body after the faculty
committee on courses and
degrees voted 5-2 May 17 to
recommend that Wilson form
such a committee.

Several members of the com-
mittee, which began meeting
last month and‘is expected to
report to the faculty by April,
said it is divided in its opinions
regarding the spring semester.
The main alternative being
discussed is a 30-week calendar
split into two 15-week semes-

ters.

‘Within the faculty there has
been some discontent with the
12-124 plan (W&L’s current
calendar, which has two 12-
week semesters and the six-
week semester) ,’’ said Dr. John
Wise, chairman of the commit-
tee.

“Six weeks is just too short of
a time to present some of the
course material that is present-
ly being offered. The course
load for the students may be too
low, and some of the students
may be treating some of their
courses too cavalierly.

“Some are using spring term
for Goshen parties rather than
academics.”

Those feelings were prevalent
last spring when the courses
and degrees committee made
its recommendation, according
to senior Rob Woods, a student
representative to that commit-
tee who is now on the calendar
committee. Senior Lee Feld-
man is the other student
member.

“Some teachers were com-

plaining that students weren’t
putting out,’ Woods said. “I
pointed out that it was partly
the teacher’s fault as well...But
some courses aren’t what I
would consider respectable.
Some must be revised or im-
proved. If not, I think we should
go to a 15-week term.”

The calendar committee has
met three times and is still ac-
cumulating information, Wise
said. A questionnaire will be
sent to faculty members and
department chairmen within
the next week. Feldman and
Woods are preparing a student
questionnnaire that probably
will be distributed before
Thanksgiving vacation.

The questionnaires will
survey the opinions of the facul-
ty and students as to what type
of calendar they feel would be
most effective at W&L.

“We're not limiting discus-
sion to the 12-12-6 and the two
semester calendars,’’ Wise
said. The questionnaire will in-
clude such possibilities as the
4-1-4 calendar used by Sweet
Briar and Hollins Colleges, that
provides for a short semester in
January.

The questionnaire also will
determine if faculty members
have enough class meetings
during both the 12-week and the
six-week semesters.

Wilson said in a recent inter-
view that he could understand
the faculty’s not having enough
class time, particularly during
the six-week semester.

“There is a feeling that while

the six-week term provides
great opportunities in certain
fields, for the greater part it
doesn’t function very well.

“‘T can see the problem of con-
centration because I’m familiar
with the field of literature. I’m
mostly concerned with what
can provide us with an optimum
academic experience for the
students and the most satisfac-
tory teaching experience for the
faculty.

“You can read ‘Hamlet’ for a
lifetime and not fully under-
stand it.”’

Because Washington and
Lee’s school year ends later
than many other universities;
Feldman said, many students
have expressed concerns over
the availability of summer jobs.

‘A lot of students want to get
out early because they feel all
the summer jobs are taken by
the time they get home, and
they’ll get the jobs no one else
wanted,’’ Feldman said.

“I don’t see it (spring
semester) harming anybody,”
he said. “If it’s utilized to its
fullest potential, it can only
help. It’s up to the students to
take advantage of what’s of-
fered.”

The other student represen-
tative, Woods, disagrees. ‘I
would like to see some way to
improve the six-week term to
make it more legitimate,’’ he
said.

The split between the two stu-
dent representatives typifies
the split among the committee
as a whole. Woods said four of

the professors on the committee
were in favor of change and
four were opposed.

“The committee is sort of
mixed in its feelings,’ Wise
said. ‘‘We have members who
are quite approving of the
12-12-46 and others who think
that we ought to go to the
semester system.”’

“The committee is definitely
giving it a fair viewpoint,”
Woods said. “‘They’re not bias-
ed one way or the other.”

Both student representatives
said their goal was. to ensure
students a voice in any decision.

“The faculty does not have to
listen to the students,’ Feld-
man said. ‘But I think they’ll
make a significant attempt to.”’

“T think the best way is to find
out what interested people have
to say because we want thought-
out responses,” he added.

I think this faculty subcom-
mittee is very interested in
what students have to say.”

After receiving the commit-
tee’s report in April, the faculty
could make a decision on the
calendar either later in the
spring or next fall, Wise said.
He added that any changes
could become effective with the
1985-86 academic year.

Faculty members of the sub-
committee are Dr. Harlan
Beckley, Dr. Jay Cook Jr., Dr.
John Jennings, Dr. George Ray,
Dr. Taylor Sanders, Dr. Edgar

. Spencer, Dr. Buford Stephenson

and Wise. Registrar Harold
Head is an ex officio member.

EC downs paying poll watchers

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

The Executive Committee
voted Monday night not to pay
students to man polls during
elections.

Sophomore representative
James White proposed such an
action last week in light of the
recent throwing-out of a
freshman’ class__ election
because no one was watching
the polls. The EC had postponed
a decision until this week.

“It’s a way of getting a
positive incentive to get some-
one to go out there,” White said.
“Throughout history, things
have worked a lot better when
there’s been some kind of
reward.

“TI don’t see anything morally
wrong with paying people to
man the polls. I think that we
need some permanent solution
to get this problem alleviated.”

Nine EC members disagreed
with White’s assesment and
voted against the motion. Their
arguments, though, included
the rationale of having anyone

at the polls at all.

“‘The freshmen are kind of in
the dark about why there needs
to be people manning them,”’
said freshman representative
Andy Caruthers, who added
that it seemed to be “‘undermin-
ing the honor code.”’

However, said junior rep Cole
Dawson, ‘‘There are going to be
people who commit honor viola-
tions. It’s inherent in the stu-
dent body. All it takes is one
person. I think for that reason
alone there ought to be someone
there.”

“T don’t see that it’s

necessary to pay _ people,”
Dawson added.

Classmate Darby Brower
agreed. ‘‘I don’t like the idea of
people getting money for sitting
with the polls,” he said.

EC President Bob Jenevein,
upperclass law representative
Jim Green and White voted for
the motion, which failed 9-3.

In a related matter, the EC
voted unanimously to hold a poll
on the question of whether the
plus-minus grading system
should affect upperclassmen.

That poll will be taken before
Thanksgiving break.

Also Monday night, the EC
heard budget reports from the
Calyx, the Ring-tum Phi and the
Mock Convention.

Dave Killenbeck, business
manager of the Calyx, said any
fraternity that failed to pay past
bills by March 1 would not get
its picture in this year’s year-
book.

Steve Lewis, co-chairman of
the Mock Convention, reported
on four or five different
methods being used to raise
money.

These include letters to
parents and alumni and an arti-
cle in an upcoming issue of the
alumni magazine.

Lewis also said that some
bonds may have to be sold
before maturity because they
will not mature until after the
convention. He described the
loss involved as ‘‘not substan-
tial,’ though, and said that cash
flow should not be a problem.

Iwo sentenced Monday
for September assault

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

Two Lexington men were
sentenced Monday in Lexington
General District Court to six
months in jail each for the Sept.
18 assault of two Washington
and Lee students.

John Davis and Daniel Long,
who immediately appealed
their sentences, were given the
option of $500 cash bail or $1000
bond each. The appeal is
scheduled to be heard in
Rockbridge County Circuit
Court on Dec. 7, 1983.

The two men were charged
with the assault and battery of
W&L junior Ed Buttarazzi and
senior Roger McDonough.

Hess sentenced them to 90
days in jail on each count for a
total of six months.

Davis and Long confessed
their involvement to police
shortly afterward, but the two
students did not lodge charges
against their attackers until
Oct. 12, when warrants were
delivered to Lexington Police
Chief L.O. Sutton.

The warrants were served

shortly after they were received
by police. Sutton said he had
‘“‘no idea” why the W&L stu-
dents waited so Icng before
pressing charges.

Sutton said that the unusual
confession came when he and
investigating officer Torben
Pedersen were questioning the
two.

‘*‘We wanted to know for sure
who did it. We started asking
some questions, and they ad-
mitted it,’”’ Sutton said.

so he wants W&L to change to

. suit him.

And this is what chafes me
the most. If some students find
that this school isn’t right for
them, why don’t they go to
another school that suits their
taste better, instead of trying to
change a very distinctive school
like W&L? Get thee to a nun-
nery. You remind me of the
Iranians who held mass demon-
strations in Washington, saying
just -thow much they hated
America and burning American
flags, then popped the kids back
in the Buick and hurried home
so they could catch the ’Skins on
TV.

I know many guys who came
to W&L because it is all-male,
because that is what they
preferred. If you find that you
don’t like the idea of an all-male
school, then transfer to one that
isn’t. Now, let’s pretend, Mr.
Whitehead, that you walked into
a room that had 20 chairs, but
the one you chose to sit in was
all lumpy. Would you call an
upholsterer? No! You would
move to another chair! If you
catch my drift. I don’t mean to
sound too particularly nasty
here. It’s just that I really don’t
think it’s fair that the choice of
going to an all-male college is
being taken away by guys who
made the wrong choice in pick-
ing a college.

Pyle noted last week, ‘“‘Let open

the door to one so fundamental
a change, and nothing can stop
the tide.” If W&L goes coed, our
sports teams — including the
lacrosse team, which already
competes at a disadvantage in
Division I — will have a smaller
pool of men from which to
choose. So then the cry will go
up for W&L to bastardize itself
by giving athletic scholarships,
an idea that has been suggested
before. Next will come a growth
in the student body and, lo and
behold, with tradition crumbl-
ing behind us, we become as fat,
lazy, and bloated as our cousins
in Charlottesville. When Mr.
Jefferson created his universi-
ty, he made it small and all-
male for a purpose. Now his
University of Virginia pays peo-
ple to play sports for it, the
Honor Code has become the
Don’t-Get-Caught Code, and
poor Tom is turning in his grave
like a pig roasting ona spit.

And I don’t even want to talk
to the people who say we have to
go coed to stay alive financially.
Changing the _ philisophical
structure of this university for
monetary reasons would make
W&L a whore. As Messrs.
Stockburger and Murphy noted
in their letter last week, if W&L
were to go coed, it would have to
be for ethical reasons. For-
tunately, there are none.

Granted W&L has problems
right now, but none of them, ab-
solutely none of them will be
cured by going coed. Letters
like Mr. Cadle’s and Professor
Margand’s of last week will
help. Increasing the number of
women professors could help
cure the misogyny and male
chauvinism. President Wilson’s
attempts to straighten out the
fraternities will help.

These are the areas in which
changes can and should be
made. Best of all, these changes
won’t destroy our school.

IFC self-improvement committee formed

By PETER WRIGHT
Staff Reporter

An Interfraternity Council
Committee on Self-Improve-
ment and a University Ad Hoc
committee on Fraternity Af-
fairs have been formed by the
IFC and W&L President John
D. Wilson respectively to
develop some standards and
guidelines for the fraternities at
Washington and Lee.

The IFC committee on self-
improvement is composed of
the 17 fraternity presidents and
IFC officials, according to IFC
President Emery Ellinger.

Its formation follows a
meeting of President Wilson

and the IFC and a consequent
resolution to make an effort
toward improving fraternities
separately and as a group.

The IFC committee has held
only one meeting and sugges-
tions were made to help im-
prove the physical appearance
of the houses, problems with
security at open parties, and the
Rush system at W&L.

The committee stressed that
each fraternity should work
closely with its respective house
adviser and form a priority list
of needed improvements rank-
ed in order of importance. The
use of a capital improvements
fund, which is a_ fraternity
assessment to be invested and

set aside for use only in the case
of an emergency also was
recommended by the commit-
tee.

Concerning the problem of
security at fraternity parties,
Ellinger said there is definitely
more awareness among the
houses on campus. The commit-
tee still made a proposal that
each fraternity be equipped
with a lock that is bolted from
the inside of the room.

In regard to Rush, the com-
mittee suggested four alter-
natives. These include keeping
the rush system as it is, shorten-
ing the length of rush, holding
freshman orientation earlier in
the year or having a deferred

rush to be held either in the se-
cond term of school or later in
the first term.

Many arguments were heard
at the meeting and according to
Ellinger, the majority of the
fraternity presidents and IFC
officials feel that the fraternity
rush structure should remain
unchanged.

“‘We have a fine-tuned Rush
calendar which takes into con-
sideration both the freshmen
and the fraternities,”’ Ellinger
said.

Committee Chairman Wade
Brannon agreed with Ellinger.

“‘We think the Rush system is
a good thing for the freshmen,”’
he said.

Both Ellinger and Brannon
also said they felt the Rush
calendar, which approved by
the Student Affairs Committee
each year, provides an ade-
quate amount of time for the
freshmen to both study and
become involved in the affairs
of the university. Nevertheless,
Ellinger said, the IFC will place
more interest on the academic
endeavors of the freshmen in
the future.

Mann predicts close race for
Commonwealth’s Attorney

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

Democratic Commonwealth’s
Attorney candidate Larry Mann
says the citizens of Lexington
and Rockbridge County are
“ready for a change” and that
he is the candidate with the best
chance of unseating incumbent
John Read Nov. 8.

“IT think he may be surpris-
ed,’”’ Mann said in an interview
this week. ‘“‘But my feeling is
that it’s going to be extremely
close either way.

“If it were a two-way race, I
could be more confident, but in
a four-way contest the vote can
go so many different ways.”

He does not view either of the
other two challengers as a
distinct threat to his candidacy.

When independent Robert N.
Joyce entered the race, Mann
said ‘‘the way [Joyce] perceiv-
ed it, he was in the middle”’
and would draw votes from both
Read and Mann.

Larry Mann

“It’s not developing that way,
though,”’ Mann said. “I’m get-
ting people crossing over from
John and voting for me. I’ve
gotten a lot of that in the last
week.”’ :

Mann said that an ideal race
would be ‘‘between two strong,
viable candidates. Bucky
[Joyce] is certainly a viable
candidate, but he’s not a strong
one.”’

According to Mann, indepen-
dent James T. Adams ‘‘has

   

been a wondertui asset to the
campaign. Jim is willing to call
things exactly as he sees them.

‘“‘He’s unafraid of any of the
consequences of his remarks.
He’s an appealing individual,
but not a strong candidate.”’

Mann said he sees broad dis-
satisfaction with the perfor-
mance of incumbent John
Read. ‘‘Some people don’t like
that hard attitude that every of-
fender has to serve time,’’ he
said.

“The main issue as I go
around talking to people is the
need for a change. Some people
want change for the sake of
change; others have questions
about Mr. Read’s conduct.”’

Mann said that “‘in order to
effect that change in a four-way
race, one candidate needs to get
a substantial block of votes.

“The voters need to get
behind the candidate that has
the best chance of winning if
they’re committed to making
that change.”’

His perception that he is the
candidate with the best chance
“is just a feeling I get from go-
ing out there and talking to peo-
ple. With my background, I
have a very broad base of sup-
port.”’

Calling Read’s conviction
rate ‘‘abysmal,’’ Mann says he
disagrees with the incumbent’s
entire approach to the office.

“The theme of my whole can-
didacy is that the person in that
office should be able to exercise
good judgment for the
Commonwealth,’’ Mann said.

“Mr. Read tends to ask for
jail or penitentiary time
regardless of the circum-
stances. To me, that is not the
proper exercise of judgment.

“John’s position is an easier
way to approach the office. I see
the job as very challenging.”’

Mann thinks his view of the
role of the Commonwealth’s At-
torney is in agreement with
both ‘the legal description’

and ‘‘the needs of the communi-
."

“It is not purely an adver-
sarial role,’’ he says. ‘When
you stand before the court as
the Commonwealth’s Attorney,
you stand clothed with the full
power and responsibility of the
Commonwealth.

“By definition, you have con-
flicting duties. You are respon-
sible for the protection of the in-
nocent as well as the protection
of the interests of the Common-
wealth against criminal con-
duct.”

One change Mann said he
would make is to devote all of
his time to the office. ‘“‘Based on
my observation of the office for
quite a while, the Common-
wealth’s Attorney should be
available at all times,” he said.

He also says he would reduce
the office expenses. ‘‘There are
tax dollars that can be saved
—there’s no question about it,”’
he said. “‘That’s part of your re-
sponsibility.

“But I wouldn't cut the
budget just for the sake of cut-
ting the budget — only as need-
ed.”’

Death of meal-in-a-peel :

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Siaff Reporter

Letitia P. Evans Dining Hall
may not be like home, as food
service director Jerry Darrell
told this year’s freshman class,
since he doesn’t know one’s
idiosyncrasies, such as whether
your mother butters your toast
from left to right or right to left.
Darrell did stress that the din-
ing hall is receptive to all sug-
gestions, yet in last spring’s din-
ing hall survey, an overwhelm-
ing majority of students
answered the question, ‘‘Is din-
ing hall management receptive
to suggestions?” with the
response, ‘“‘We’ll see after this
survey.”

The time to see has come, as
the 350 questionnaires dis-
tributed in the dining hall last
spring elicited about 200
responses. After personally
reading all of the twenty-
question survey sheets, Darrell
has made some_ sweeping
changes in Evans Dining Hall.

Darrell normally runs on a
four-week menu cycle, which he
alters slightly so that no two
weeks are exactly the same, but
for the first time in six years, he
has revamped the entire menu.
“You have to remember that
when you take something off,
you must put something else

on,” explains Darrell, who
eliminated a number of un-
popular items such as ‘‘meal in
a peel,” from the menu.

Students now have lunch
items in addition to breakfast.
Both eggs and omelettes to
order, as well as ‘‘make your
own waffles,’ are popular
breakfast changes begun last
spring.

Choice, half-pound, rib-eye
steaks are now offered twice a
month, and fried shrimp once a
cycle. Breakfast currently runs
until 9 a.m., rather than 8:45, so
‘“‘A”’ hour people can eat after
class ; root beer has been placed
on the lunch and dinner menus,
and ice cream is served more
often.

The food service director was
most surprised by the trend
from meat and potatoes to
vegetables and_ health-
conscious meals. ‘‘There are a
lot more vegetarians and non-
meat eaters here than I realiz-
ed,’”’ Darrell said. Thus, many
lunches now include a_ vege-
tarian third entree, as well as
non-meat casseroles’ with
seconds.

Overall, many of the sugges-

tions were acted upon. ‘We

can’t make everybody happy
every day (but), I feel very
strongly that I have a handle on
your group,’ said Darrell,
whose door is always open to
suggestions. Why go out of one’s
way to pass out a questionnaire
if few people use the suggestion
box, and freshmen are notor-
ious for gaining ‘‘the freshman
fifteen” pounds per year? Dar-
rell thinks people feel conscious
about using the suggestion box
on the door, and he may move it
back to the salad table. And
besides, adds Darrell, ‘You
can’t rest on tomorrow with
what you did yesterday.”’

Martinez trains
Samurai actors

Entertainment

By BOB BRYANT
Staff Reporter

“‘T have spent all my life try-
ing to find the correct technique
for teaching acting and move-
ment,” said Joseph Martinez, a
new drama professor at Wash-
ington and Lee University and
director of “‘Rashomon,”’ which
opens Nov. 4 at 9 p.m. at W&L’s
University Theatre.

Martinez, 36, is enthusiastic
about his new job at W&L for
that reason “I am enamored of
the true liberal arts focus at
Washington and Lee,”’ he said.
After 12 years of teaching at
such schools as Purdue, the
University of Denver, the
University of Chicago, Virginia
Commonwealth University and
the University of Illinois, he is
convinced that ‘‘drama should
be taught at either professional
theatre schools like Juilliard, or
liberal arts colleges like W&L.”’
He cites the geographic isola-
tion of many “‘pre-professional”’
drama programs at major uni-
versities as a hinderance to
what he calls ‘‘pragmatic’’
theater education.

On one wall of his office at the
University Theatre are 17
featureless masks, each wear-

ing a_ different expression.
Propped in one corner and lying
across a bookcase shelf are
several samurai swords, which
he forged himself for
‘Rashomon.’ Weapons and
combat have long interested
Martinez, who wrote a_ book,
““Combat Mime,” on the art of
fighting on the stage. He
describes the book as being ‘‘100
illusions of how to smash peo-
ple’s heads against brick walls
and things like that.”’

Martinez, who was on the fen-
cing team as an undergraduate
student at Illinois Wesleyan
University, fought with almost
every weapon since the ancient
Greeks while he was doing
graduate study at the Royal
Academy of Dramatic Arts in
London. That experience with
the academy’s weapons collec-
tion was extremely valuable to
him because he was able to
learn the method of fighting
with each one.

“This was particularly im-
portant with the earlier
weapons, because it wasn’t un-
til the 1400’s that there was any
written record of methods of
fighting with these weapops,”’
he said.

He has also fought in full com-

bat armor, and explained ‘‘the
myth of a man being rendered
immobile by his armor is
ridiculous. Wearing 60 pounds
of battle armor is like wearing a
backpack, except the weight is
distributed all over your body.
It’s very easy to handle if you
train with it.”’

Gridders fall to Sewanee

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
Generals football team had
several outstanding individual
performances last Saturday,
but these efforts were not
enough as the University of the
South Tigers defeated the
Generals, 16-10.

The Generals got over 200
yards rushing from the tailback
position alone, as junior Gene
Girard had 133 yards on 24 car-
ries while freshman Kevin
Weaver had 101 yards on 18 car-
ries.

“Gene Girard had probably
the most impressive perfor-
mance of his college career
with 133 tough yards,” said
head coach Gary Fallon.
“Kevin Weaver came in and did
an exceptional job in spot du-
a.

However, Fallon was not as
pleased with his team’s perfor-
mance on the whole. He said
that his team ‘“‘lacked overall
team performance both defen-
sively and offensively. We need
to cut down on our mental
mistakes and recapture that
team concept.”’

Sewanee took an early 60
lead when quarterback Mark
Kent scored on a 35-yard run in
the first quarter. The Generals
were quick to answer as
Girard’s 12-yard touchdown run
put the finishing touches on an
80-yard drive. James White ad-
ded the extra point, giving the
Generals a 7-6 half-time lead.

Sewanee regained the lead in
the third quarter as a result of a
42-yard field goal by Tiger
kicker Tom Langston.

Early in the fourth quarter,
James White gave the lead back
to the Generals by kicking a 36-
yard field goal, making the
score, 10-9. This lead was short-
lived, however, as Reggie Ben-
son scored the game-winner for
the Tigers on a three-yard run
with 5:22 remaining in the

game.

Trailing 16-10 in the waning
moments of the game, the
Generals had a chance to pull
the game out after linebacker
Kurt Specht blocked a Tiger
punt that was recovered at the
Sewanee 17-yard line. The Tiger
defense rose to the occasion,
however, sacking quarterback
Bobby Wilson on the final play
of the game.

“‘We have to play better than
we did at Sewanee, and I have
to coach better than I did at
Sewanee,” Fallon said. ‘‘We
have to put it behind us and

The brain and pain

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

...Watching the New York Ci-
ty Marathon last Sunday arous-
ed my curiosity about the
athlete and pain. Granted there
are a number of purely physical
aspects in the athlete’s battle to
deal with injury, and pain
varies as the athlete does, but
there are most certainly points
where the mind enters the con-
flict. It was this conflict that ap-
peared so noticeable in the
marathon. (Thank you, ABC,
for your fine coverage.) It has
been said that the brain’s poten-
tial is unknown, limitless for all
intents and purposes. What
seems even more astounding is
the power that man’s nerve
center wields over his body.
When the mind’s power to shut
out pain becomes greater than
the body’s ability to create pain
—an entirely feasible and
perhaps necessary quality in
the athlete — man’s ability to
succeed (finish a marathon in
this case) can become as
limitless as the brain’s capaci-
ty. In Sunday’s marathon, a
man who had never run a
marathon before led the race

come back strong.”’

The loss evened the Generals’
1983 record at 3-3. W&L hosts
ODAC foe Bridgewater College
this Saturday with hopes of
returning to winning ways. The
Eagles are 0-6 on the year, but
coach Fallon believes that his
team ‘‘can’t take them lightly
or else we'll be 3-4 in a big
hurry. Bridgewater has beaten
us three of the last five times
we’ve played them, including a
year ago (a 28-13 Eagle victory)
up at their place. They always
play out of their socks against
us.”

McBryde keeps on running

For Washington and Lee
senior Angus McBryde, the
decision to become a distance
runner was a pragmatic one.

As a seventh grader in his

native Charlotte, N.C.,
McBryde wanted to get involv-
ed in a varsity sport.

“I wasn’t very good at foot-
ball, and my father had run
track,” recalls McBryde. ‘‘So I
decided on track.”’

But McBryde began his track
career as a sprinter competing
in the 100- and 220-yard dashes.

“It took two meets to
establish beyond any doubt that
I was not a sprinter. That’s
when I decided to try dis-
tances,’ McBryde says with a
grin.

“I began running distance
before the running fad really
kicked in around the country.
Those of us who were running
back then were pretty much out
there alone. Now it seems
everyone is running.”’

But McBryde is still ahead of
the crowd.

He is as comfortable running
across the wooded hillsides on
the Generals’ picturesque five-
mile cross country course as he
is circling the track at Wilson
Field as the premier distance
runner on W&L’s track and field
team.

“It would be hard for me to
choose between my track and
cross country experiences,”’
says McBryde. “I love them
both, but for different reasons.”’

One obvious reason that
McBryde loves both is that he
has been so successful at both.

Last spring as a member of
the W&L track and field team
he set new W&L records in both
the 5000-meter (14:54.1) and
1500-meter (3:53.6) events and
became only the third Wash-
ington and Lee athlete ever to
qualify for the NCAA Division
III Track and Field Champion-
ships.

Already this fall McBryde has
reestablished himself as the

Generals’ top cross country per-
former. He has been the first
W&L runner across the finish
line in each of W&L’s first three
meets. Moreover, he has im-
proved his time with each per-
formance and was the indi-
vidual winner in last Saturday’s
quadrangular meet with

Catholic University, American
University and Eastern Men-
nonite. He won that event in a
time of 26 minutes, 52 seconds.
“There is a lot more strategy

 

involved in running cross coun-
try than non-runners might
realize. You have to know
where you can pick up time on a
given course. It’s important to
plan your strategy ahead of
time based on the course that
you are running:

‘Washington and Lee has the
toughest cross country course
in the state, in my opinion. It’s
also one of the best to run
because you get out in the
woods and can really lose touch.

You can lose yourself in the
country.”

McBryde’s best cross country
performance at W&L came dur-
ing his sophomore year when he
ran a 25 minute, 48 second race.

“Tt should be capable of
reaching the low of 25 minutes,”
says McBryde. “‘That’s my goal
right now.”’ 2

Another of McBryde’s goals
involves making the field for
the NCAA Division III Cham-
pionships, which will be held in

Newport News, Va., in Novem-
ber.

“T really believe that we have
a chance to qualify as a team
for the nationals,’ says
McBryde, who was the top run-
ner among independent high
school athletes in North
Carolina during his senior year
at Charlotte Latin. “This is my
last opportunity to compete in
the national cross country
meet, so it’s clearly one of my
major goals this season.”

A tale of two sports

After two seasons and one
game as a tight end on
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s football team, Ian Banwell
is no longer tempted to shout
scrum at the sight of a loose
ball.

The Lexington, Ky., native
could be excused for some in-
itial confusion when he entered
W&L as a freshman in 1981.
After all, it had been two years
since Banwell had seen a for-
ward pass, let alone catch one.

After playing tight end during
his sophomore year at Henry
Clay High School, Banwell had
dropped out of football and
taken up rugby.

“It was a -combination of
things,’’ said Banwell.

“On the one hand I’d lost in-
terest in football and had been a
bit confused about what I
wanted to do. But on the other
hand I knew that my father was
going to be working in England
during my senior year in high
school, so I thought I’d be able
to give rugby a try over there.”

So Banwell joined up with the
Blackstone club team in Lex-
ington and learned the in-
tricacies of the game. The
following year he was off to
England where he became a
rugby player of some note,
earning All-Eastern Counties
honors, the rough equivalent of
all-state in the U.S., in 19-and-
under rugby.

“My American football in-
stincts stood me in good stead
over there,” says Banwell
‘Rugby is quite a finesse game
in England. But I had a very ag-
gressive style of play, a more
physical style.”

When he came back to the
states, Banwell decided it was

time to switch back to the
American version of the sport
and asked W&L head coach
Gary Fallon for a tryout.

“We didn’t exactly recruit
him off the rugby field,” says
Fallon. ‘‘We didn’t have any
films of him to watch. And if I’d
seen films of him playing
rugby, I’m not sure I’d have
known what to look for.’’

But Banwell got his trial and
wound up playing quite a bit
during his freshman year when
starting tight end Mike Fogarty
was injured. Last year Banwell
suffered an early hamstring in-
jury, so his playing time was
limited. And this year he is
sharing the tight end spot with
sophomore Rob Brown.

“It took me a while to get
back into football when I first
started,’ says Banwell. “For
instance, I hadn’t worn pads
since my sophomore year in
high school, so thaf was an ad-
justment. And the skills in the
two sports are a bit different.

“In order to be a great rugby
player you have to be absolutely
nuts. I know because I played
with some great ones, and they
were absolutely nuts,’ says
Banwell.

Fallon is certainly happy that
Banwell switched.

“T only know what I’ve heard
about rugby — that you have to
love contact to play it,” says
Fallon. ‘‘Ian must have been a
pretty darn good rugby player
because he loves to block.”

Rumors to the contrary,
Fallon does not plan to start
recruiting the Eastern Counties
of England for tight ends.

‘‘We’ll stick to the States,” he
says. “For now.”

Generals win three

By RICK PIERCE
Staff Reporter

Angus McBryde, who finished
under 26 minutes, paced the
Washington & Lee harriers to a
victory in last Saturday’s
quadrangular meet in Bridge-
water. “That was Angus’ best
time of the season, but it came
on a very fast course,’’ Coach
Dick Miller said.

The Generals score was also
aided by fine performances
from Frank Pittman, Eddie
Goundry, Paul Chapman, Ted
Myers, and Mark Pembroke,
who finished second, third,
fifth, sixth, and seventh respec-
tively. Only a fourth-place
finisher contained the Generals
from achieving a shut out in a

quadrangular meet which
Coach Miller points out, ‘That
is something very hard to do.”’
The competing teams were
W&L, West Virginia Tech,
Newport News Apprentice
School, and host Bridgewater.

This week the Generals are
looking for three more wins in-
this week’s quadrangular meet
at home. Featured in the meet
will be Eastern Mennonite,
Lynchburg College, and
Hampden-Sydney ~- College.
Coach Miller commented that
this week’s meet is very impor-
tant. ‘We have to keep our
momentum with us going into
the ODAC Championships.”
The ODAC meet will be held on
Nov. 5.

Soccer stops H-SC,
ups mark to 6-4

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee soc-
cer team played over half of
Saturday’s home game against
Hampden-Sydney without head
coach Rolf Piranian, but still
the Generals came away with a
3-1 victory over their ODAC
rivals.

The Generals built a 2-0 lead
early in the game before Piran-
ian was shown first a yellow
caution card for alledgedly
stepping onto the field while
protesting one of the referee’s
calls, and then a red ejection
card for protesting the first
card. Piranian said of the
referee, who also gave yellow
cards to General midfielder
mark Sullivan and the Hamp-
den-Sydney coach, “I didn’t
think he did the world’s greatest
job. Fortunately, it didn’t mat-
ter that much.”

Senior co-captain Roland
Simon opened the scoring with
his sixth goal of the season.
(Simon scored last week’s goal
against Lynchburg, not Bill
Homes, as was_ incorrectly

reported.) Junior midfielder
Jeff Reichert notched his third
goal of the season to give W&La
2-0 lead.

Colonel David Fowler, in his
second season as_ assistant
coach, took over at the helm
after Piranian’s first-ever ejec-
tion as W&L head coach.
“Coach Piranian has a game
plan set up before every game,”
explained Col. Fowler, ‘‘and I
just followed his game plan.”’

Five minutes into the second
half Holmes’ long throw-in
found sophomore midfielder
Keith Scott, who sent home his
first goal of the season for a 3-0
lead.

W&L outshot the Tigers, 29-8,
and held them scoreless until a
goal with 28 minutes left kept
goalie Jay Werner from his
fourth shutout of the season.

The Generals, 6-4 overall and
2-2 in conference play, travel to
Washington, D.C., on Saturday
to face Catholic University in
the final ODAC game of the
season. The Generals also visit
Radford University on Tuesday
in the next to last game of the
season.

Richmond loss puts

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
water polo team finished second
in the Southern League Tourna-
ment last weekend in Rich-
mond, Va. The Generals won
three games and lost one. They
defeated Hampden-Sydney,
Virginia
University and the University
of North Carolina at Wilm-
ington. The Generals’ loss came
against tournament champion
Richmond.

-Richmond’s victory over
W&L last weekend combined
with their 13-5 early season vic-
tory over the Generals will give
Richmond the number one
seeding at the Southern League
Championships. W&L will be
the tournament’s second seed.

Concerning individual perfor-
mances last weekend, Tim
Rock led the Generals. Rock
scored four of W&L’s eight
goals against Richmond.

On Saturday the Generals will
participate in the Virginia State

Commonwealth

polo at second seed

Championships at Richmond.
In addition to W&L, teams from
Richmond, Hampden-Sydney,
Virginia, Virginia Common-
wealth University and Lynch-
burg College will compete.

Richmond and W&L will be
seeded one and two respectively
in the weekend’s tournament.
They have a bye to the semi-
finals.

A W&L victory over Rich-
mond this weekend will not af-
fect the seedings for the

‘Southern League Champion-

ships. Coach Newcomb
believes, however, that it is im-
portant for W&L to win this
weekend. He said, ‘‘We believe
that the winner this weekend
will have an edge going into the
Southern League Champion-
ships.’ Looking to the
Generals’ future, Coach
Newcomb is confident that
W&L will play well. Newcomb
stated, ‘‘We’re really looking
forward to the Southern League
Championships. We will be
playing well. Our game should
be complete.”’

when they leave, carry the prin-
ciples with them into their lives
and vocations. Where are the
fruits of Messrs. S. & M.’s
labor? Have they struggled to
be an actively positive force at

Now let us look at the accused

Control’s defense. Charlie
Alcorn has done a superior job
this year amid very difficult
and unpleasant circumstances.
He personally went to extraor-

possible information in the
Dederick affair. Most of this in-
formation is not, nor should it
be, common knowledge. We all
have Student Control to thank
for the restrained and proper
manner in which they have con-

even on what basis it was made.
The utmost confidence the
university administration has
in the idea of student self
discipline and likewise their
confidence in the opinion of Stu-

cepting the recommendation of
Student Control in the Dederick
affair. Messrs. S. & M. had a
chance to run for class offices,
and thus be a part of the system
of student government, they
chose not to do so. Student Con-

I would like to add my com-
ments on the Interfraternity

at Pennsylvania, I hope my
comments will not be con-
sidered fatally biased. I, con-
cededly, know very little about
the IFC at W&L but if the ac-
cusation of Messrs. S. & M.
—namely, that the IFC has
formed a ‘‘Committee for Self
Improvement”’ is true, then I
know the IFC is on the right
track. The IFC and the entire
fraternity system at W&L must
be allowed themselves to cor-
rect any perceived inade-
quacies in the system, and to

continue to develop an IFC net-
work which is proper for W&L.
Over the past three years, I
have visited several fraternity
parties, been graciously receiv-

‘ed by the hosts, and have yet to

see the ‘‘meat market’’ that
Messrs. S & M. describe. I feel it
is quite ungentlemanly for
Messrs. S&M to imply that the
ladies who do attend fraternity
parties are their intellectual in-
feriors, for I fear that would
place the young ladies in almost
an exclusive class. In short, I
feel the IFC and the Fraternity
System at W&L is one that the
entire University and the Alum-
ni can be proud of. Certainly
there is room for improvement
to the physical plants of some of
the houses, but there is nothing
wrong with the ideals and goals
of the system as it stands. From
what I have seen, Rush at W&L,
in comparison with other Rush

practices I have known, is far
from being an ‘‘obsolete
system’ as described by
Messrs. S. & M. Rush at W&L
appears to me to be well
organized, well carried out, and
ideally suited to the W&L tradi-
tion and the community.

While I am certain Messrs. S.
& M. felt bound to their tenets,
they need not have lashed out in
the fashion they chose. Their
style I find hard to reconcile
with the ideals of either our
benefactor, George Washington
or our beloved president,
Robert E. Lee. For even when
faced with most dire emergen-
cies and seemingly hopeless
situations, be it Valley Forge or
Washington College after the
War, these two great Virginians
by positive constructive efforts
and self sacrificing virtue lead
others forward by their own ex-
ample. The W&L_ tradition,
Messrs. S. & M., is one of action
not one of idle finger pointing.

Ignoring relevant facts

To the editors:

As the battle over coeduca-
tion rages on around him, Mr.
N.P. Whitehead chooses to ig-
nore the relevent facts in his re-
cent letter on coeducation.
There are good traditions and
bad traditions. The thought of
comparing being — single-sex

with slavery is not only
pointless, but serves only to
confuse the issue. Washington

and Lee is more than a tradi-
tion, it’s an institution. W&L
isn’t single sex because it’s a
neat idea. We are single-sex
because that is Washington and
Lee’s identity, it’s what makes

us not just another small col-
lege. W&L is unique. That’s
right, I said unique. How can
Mr. Whitehead claim that W&L,
an all-male university es-
tablished in 1749, with an

historical and beautiful cam-
pus, highly competitive
academics, and a_ working
honor code established by the
great Robert E. Lee, is not uni-
que. The dictionary states that
unique is ‘‘being without like or
equal,’’ and, ‘‘very rare or un-
common.’’ In my opinion we are
without either like or equal.

Mr. Whitehead claims that
“the social atmosphere is total-
ly unnatural.”’ It’s quite plain to
see though, that the entire col-
lege social system is unreal-
istic. The difference with W&L
is that our social system calls

   
 

 

SILILSDI LAS Dd

for imagination and ag-
gressiveness to make the best of
it. Partying at any of the large
coed schools will show you that
the college social scene is un-
natural whether you need to
walk across the street, or drive
45 minutes to get to a party. A
really mature adult should be
able to accept the equality of

women, regardless of how often
we see them.

But, does Washington and Lee
need coeducation? The answer
is that I don’t know. I do know
that the decision must be weigh-
ed with utmost care, because
the life of our university is on
the line. One thing must certain-
ly be kept in mind, though. W&L
is different, not just because we

are an all-male school, but ©

because we’re a good, all-male
school. The object is to find a
happy medium between the
high academics and the unique
all-male environment. If stay-
ing all-male seriously affects
the academic excellence of
W&L (which is so far only
postulated) then there seems to
be little choice than to go coed.
But, if coeducation is an issue
because of the supposed im-
maturity of our social system,
or the lack of women in the
classroom, then there is no
issue, Coeducation may become
necessary, but unlike Mr.
Whitehead, I think it would be a
necessary evil.

News, that the tapes were what
they were ‘“‘purported to be”’
and that the subject was ‘‘news-
worthy.”

Joyce said it was not relevant
to ask why Mr. Flynt or his
source wanted the tapes broad-
cast, because ‘‘every individual
you deal with has some
motive.”

It was apparent, or should
have been apparent, that the
prosecutor and his staff would

have no motivation for pre-.

mature public disclosure of key
evidence that they expected to
use to prove De Lorean’s par-
ticipation in a drug conspiracy
to raise money for his failing
auto company in Northern Ire-
land.

It should have been equally
apparent to CBS officials at
every level that the major
beneficiary of the premature
disclosure of the De Lorean
tapes would be De Lorean and
other defendants involved in the
drug conspiracy trial. CBS of-
ficials were warned that the
defendants and their lawyers
would use the improper dis-
closure of key evidence to ask
for delays, to demand dismissal
of all charges, and to create
general confusion in a prosecu-
tion that would be difficult
enough at best.

Is the people’s right to know
about the De Lorean tapes on
Oct. 23, 1983, paramount to the
rights of the government and
the defendants and the court to
have those tapes kept secret un-
til they are admitted in evi-
dence at the trial or at least un-
til after a jury has been
selected?

CBS executives answered the
question by deciding they were
“newsworthy” and above all
‘good television” and that the
rights of the government to a
fair trial and the Sixth Amend-
ment rights of John Z. De

Lorean could be sacrificed. The
fact that delays or moving the
trial might cost millions to the
government and _ defendants
was not relevant when CBS
decided the De Lorean tapes
were ‘‘newsworthy.”’

Nor was it important to CBS
executives as to whether there
was a miscarriage of justice
either through a dismissal of
the charges or the conduct of a
trial under a procedural cloud
— a cloud that will not be
removed until De Lorean has
exhausted all of his appeals.

CBS had a constitutional right
under the First Amendment to
be wrong, to cause confusion in
the administration of justice in
a major drug trafficking case,
and it exercised that right in
continued broadcast from
KNXT-TV in Los Angeles.

However, the excesses are so
great and the lack of respon-
sibility so glaring that it is cer-
tain to bring forth arguments
that such abuses of power can-
not be permitted, and that the
government or the courts must
establish some more effective
restrictions on the operations of
the free press.

In engaging in actions that
present press critics with such
strong arguments, CBS has
done a disservice to the long-
time cause of a free press. The
airing of the De Lorean tapes by
CBS will be a subject for Free
Press-Fair Trial forums for
years to come, and the press
will be fortunate indeed if it
does not become exhibit
number one in a court case that
strips the press of some of its
vital freedom under the First
Amendment.

Republican cites
deceptive resolution

To the Editors:

Appearing in last week’s
Ring-tum Phi (Oct. 20, 1983)
was a resolution paid for the
W&L College Republicans. The
resolution strongly urged the
Board of Trustees to reject all
attempts at coeducation on
behalf of the College Repub-
licans which the resolution cor-
rectly identified as ‘‘the largest
student group at Washington
and Lee.’’ At the bottom of this
ad appeared the fact that this
resolution had been passed
unanimously by the Executive
Board of the Republicans,
which was within its rights as
stated in the Republican’s by-
laws. However, here within this
fact lies the deception of the
public.

For this mighty resolution ex-
presses the opinion of those nine

executive board members —not
of every member of the College
Republicans! This resolution
was never voted upon by the en-
tire membership or even
discussed in a general monthly
meeting. It in no way expresses
the view of every College
Republican on the issue of
coeducation as suggested in the
resolutron.

As a faithful, dues-paying
member of the College Repub-
licans who is seriously consider-
ing the issue of coeducation in
my mind and who feels such a
hasty response is not conducive
to the future of W&L, I find it
difficult to have these nine
students appear as if speaking
for me. They do not in any way.
Let not the W&L community be
deceived.

EC looks at independents

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

The Executive Committee
formed a subcommittee to han-
dle concerns of independent
students Monday night.

“This is a very, very signifi-
cant committee with a big
task,’ EC President Bob Jene-
vein said. ‘That task is to ap-
pease the independents and
solve the problems voiced by
the independents recently. It’s
certainly an issue that’s come
to the forefront.”’

EC secretary Len Howard,
the only independent on the EC,
freshman representative An-
drew Caruthers, sophomore
representatives Ken Lindeman
and James White and Jenevein
were appointed to the subcom-
mittee.

At next Monday’s meeting,
Jim Sarle of the rejuvenated In-
dependent Union will meet with
EC members and with the SAB
in what Jenevein described as
‘“‘a forum on independent mat-
ters.”

Also last night, junior repre-
sentative Cole Dawson reported
on the progress of the subcom-

mittee investigating the open
exam policy that would allow
students to take exams
whenever they pleased during
the exam week.

Scott Mason, an EC represen-
tative last year, had begun
work on the possibility but
reported to the EC earlier this
year that the biggest opposition
to an open exam policy ap-
peared to be from the Com-
merce School.

Dawson said he had talked to
Edward Atwood, dean of the
Commerce school, and that
Dean Atwood ‘‘seems very in-
terested in the idea.”’

“He seems very willing to
talk about it. I think that we
might be able to work some-
thing out,’’ Dawson added.
‘Dawson said he hopes to talk

_ to the other department chair-

men in the upcoming weeks.
Howard reported that in-
dependent David Sprunt and
SAB member Burford Smith
had been appointed to the sub-
committee arranging social ac-

There was some debate as to

centered around whether the
subcommittee should arrange
band and beer parties such as

First Lt. Syd Farrar, a 1980
graduate of Washington and
Lee, was among the United
States servicemen wounded
during last week’s invasion of
Grenada.

A native of Blackstone, Va.,
Farrar was listed in satisfac-
tory condition at Walter Reed
Hospital in Washington Tues-
day.

He had been stationed at Fort
Stewart, Ga.

Farrar was tri-captain of
Washington and Lee’s 1979 foot-
ball team, serving as tight end
and the team’s punter. He was
active in the W&L Army ROTC
detachment. He was president
of the Interfraternity Council
during his senior year.

Washington and Lee Head
Football Coach Gary Fallon
recalled this week that while at
W&L Farrar displayed an in-
spiring character.

“He was an_ outstanding
youngster,” Fallon said. ‘‘He
exemplified (while at W&L)
high spirit and dedication. He
was a gutsy type of guy.”

Fallon said that the football

qualities which Farrar repre-
sents.

“Our prayers are with him
for a speedy recovery,” Fallon
said.

 

 

Jury probes drug trafticking

By DAVE JOHNSTON
Staff Reporter

A special grand jury in-
vestigating ‘‘drug trafficking
and other conditions tending to
promote illegal activity in the
community” began meeting
this week.

The grand jury was requested
by Commonwealth’s Attorney
Beverly C. “John’’ Read and
local enforcement officals in
response to a recent rash of
drug-related arrests and con-
victions. According to court
documents filed by Read, there
have been seven convictions for
felony drug trafficking crimes,
and an additional 10 defendants

have been charged with
felonies.

The main target of the in-
vestigation, according to Lex-
ington Police Chief L.O. Sutton,
is the suppliers, rather than the
users, of drugs.

“My primary objective is to
get the people — and I will call
them parasites — who are mak-
ing profits off the people who
are too weak to stand on their
own feet,”’ said Sutton, ‘‘and to
protect young people from be-
coming infected by these
parasites.”’

Some youths, Sutton said, fall
prey to drugs because of associ-
ating with users, and by
eliminating that element this
could possibly be prevented.

By forming the grand jury,
Sutton said, local enforcement
officials hope to be able to com-
bat the drug problem more easi-
ly. Sutton said the special grand
jury, which does not have the
power to indict, could be used to
gain more testimony. A defen-
dant must answer the special
grand jury’s subpoenas, and
must answer their questions,
unlike a standard interrogation
situation. He also said that
along with this testimony comes
varying degrees of immunity.

Sutton, who said he has many
names of people who may be in-
vestigated, could not elaborate
more on the special grand
jury’s procedure, and Read was
unavailable for comment.

Review and Outlook

Clear reflection

Once again, the issue of coeducation has reared its
controversial head.

Since the late 1960s, coeducation sometimes has
been a very hot issue here at General Lee’s college.
This is one of those times.

University President John D. Wilson has said he did
not bring the issue of coeducation to Washington and
Lee, as much as some students would like to believe
he did. He has said he is merely holding up a mirror to
the University, doing what he can to better the
University.

We tend to believe him, but we also believe that
there must be a maximum of free and open discussion
by faculty, students and alumni. When the Board of
Trustees announced the issue was being re-examined,
it added that at its February meeting, methods would
be devised to keep students informed and possibly in-
clude them in the decision-making process.

This is the first step in the right direction. Although
today’s students may only be moderately affected by
coeducation, they can best reflect the reactions of
future students — students who might be attracted to
Washington and Lee.

And, indeed, we feel that it is proper at this time for
the issue of coeducation to be re-examined. A declin-
ing applicant pool and the lowering of academic
standards that might result would seriously damage
the quality of W&L. Yet, the irreversible decision to
go coed would alter 234 years of tradition.

It is for this reason that we urge the administration
and the Board to take as much time as possible to
study the issue carefully before making any decision.
The issue is much too complicated for any decision to
be rushed.

And we do not intend to rush our decision. For as
Wilson holds up a mirror to the University, The Ring-
tum Phi serves as a window between the student body
and the administration, faculty and trustees.

If that window is clouded, it will be impossible to get
an accurate view of what is going on with the issue.

Letter

Cadet-General sees need to stay
all-male as an alternative

To the Editors:

I am a 1982 graduate of VMI
and I am presently a 2nd year
law student here at W&L.
Recently I have read a great
deal concerning the coeduca-
tion issue, and I feel I must
observe a point which has so far
been neglected. That point is
alternative schooling.

There are two facets to my
point about alternative school-
ing: for men in general, and for
W&L and this area as a whole.
Young men in this country have
but five schools to choose from
if they desire an all-male educa-
tional setting. These schools
are: W&L, Hampden-Sydney,
Wabash, The Citadel and VMI.
If the young man does not
desire a military education, his
choice is narrowed to but three
colleges. On the other hand,
young women still have tens of
all-female schools from which
to choose. Thus, despite con-
cern over W&L’s own potential
future admissions problems, I
think it best to consider the
situation on the whole and to
realize how very important it is
for young men to have a viable
alternative to coeducational
schooling.

W&L must also be mindful of
how its actions will affect this
region. This area is the last
place in our nation where the
single-sex alternative thrives.
Three all-male and five all-
female colleges are clustered in

or near the Shenandoah Valley.
W&L’s decision to go coed could
send reverberations throughout
the Valley, prompting each of
the seven other single-sex
schools to reconsider its status.
I do not wish to be an alarmist,
but I believe that a coed W&L
would ultimately destroy the
unique characteristic of the
Valley. Commensurate with
that change would be the near
total destruction forever of the
single-sex alternative to all
future college-bound young
men.

I could cite studies showing
that men and women perform
better scholastically in a single-
sex atmosphere. However, I
consider that fact to be secon-
dary to the possible undoing of
this nation’s last stronghold of
traditional schooling. Single-
sex colleges are not discrim-
inatory, they are an alternative
to coed schooling. And so long
as this republic of ours remains
free, so should the right to
choose a single-sex school.

So I say to the people who will
soon be making this important
decision — do not engross
yourselves in statistics and pro-
jections about W&L’s ability to
survive within a shrinking col-
lege age population pool. First
let us see if W&L may weather
the storm without changing the
face and nature of its and the
area’s educational institutions.
A hasty decision to go coed now,

will, I assure you, never be
reversed. I personally believe
enough qualified young men
will seek the single-sex alter-
native so that the all-male
school may not only survive,
but thrive in an era of dwindling
college age populations As col-
leges across the nation scram-
ble to admit qualified young
men, it may soon be revealed
that our all-male character,
once thought to be a fatal han-
dicap, is proven to be our forte.
The jury is still out on this one
Gentlemen, and so it should re-
main for several years.

Independents strive to form union

Athletic, social needs cited

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

The drive to form an indepen-
dent union of students is being
spearheaded by sophomore Jim
Sarle and junior Joseph Cadle,
whose letter to The Ring-tum
Phi (Oct. 13, 1983) regarding the
concerns of independent
students has sparked a number
of responses. In separate inter-
views for the Phi, Sarle and
Associate Dean of Students
Michael Cappeto explained
some of the history of reasons
for an independent union.

According to Dean Cappeto,
at least two fruitless attempts
have been made to form a union
during his nine years here. He
speculated that the failures
resulted from the naturally in-
dependent nature of the non-
fraternity students, as well as a
lack of a definite mission by the
union. He stressed that the in-
dependent students must decide
what they want, and added, ‘‘I
think it can be a very valuable
orgainzation.”’

Sarle has sent a flyer con-
cerning an organizational
meeting of the union to be held
this evening to all independent
students and all freshmen. He is
looking toward two main goals

functions.

prove the social lives and ac-
tivities of independents. He is
not, however, looking to gear
the union solely towards in-
dependents, nor is he trying to
serve as a spokesman for all in-
dependents, he said.

“President Wilson was very
responsive (to the idea),’’ Sarle
said, while Cappeto said, ‘‘Dean
John and | are very interested.”
Yet Sarle envisions’ the
possibility of the problems.
“There seems to be a lot of
hesitancy...as to what kind of
turnout we’ll get. Some people
say that an independent union is
a contradiction in terms. I sup-
pose to an extent that may be
true.’’ With some of the current
controversy concerning frater-
nities, some people fear that a
rift may develop between the
frats and the independents.

Sarle doesn’t believe so,

of students would like to play

He notes that if fraternities
start having closed parties, in-
dependents will need to have
something to do on weekends,
yet ‘The Student Activities
Board seems somewhat reluc-
tant to run bands on Fridays.”
He said the SAB has an obliga-
tion to provide activities for all
students, and should not
schedule all of its activities
around the fraternities’ social
functions.

At this point, Sarle and Cap-
peto are holding a wait-and-see

The Phi Gamma Delta frater-
nity was put on social probation
until Jan. 3 by the Interfraterni-
ty Council judicial board on
Thursday because of an inci-
dent involving two of the frater-
nity’s pledges at W&L’s football
game against Hampden-Sydney
College three weeks ago.

Vincent Lamanna and
Michael McCallister, both
freshman pledges of the frater-
nity, pulled the tail off the
Hampden-Sydney College mas-
cot’s tiger costume during the
game at Hampden-Sydney. The
damage ruined the costume and
the costume must be replaced
by the two students involved.
The cost of a new costume is
$250, according to IFC president
Emery Ellinger.

The ruling on the incident did
not come under the Student
Control Committee, Ellinger
said, because it (the van-
dalism) was definitely ‘‘frat-
related.” “A bunch of guys
from that fraternity were at the
game and the two freshmen in-
volved said that it was ‘heavily

The action taken against the
two freshmen was that they
must replace the costume and
each has written a letter of
apology to the Hampden-
Sydney Dean of Students.

The IFC also took action
directly against the fraternity
as a whole. Fiji had been. on
social probation until Thanks-
giving for previous offenses.
The IFC lengthened the proba-
tion period. In addition to the
probation, the fraternity was

fined $150 and they were re-
quired to clean the streets
around the campus after Fall
Weekend, according to Ell-
inger. Fiji also must sponsor a

Hunger Drive. The fraternity
must collect at least 300 cans.
The ruling handed down by
the IFC is subject to appeal by
the fraternity to the Student Af-

Timerman postponed again

Indefinite return due to illness

The scheduled lecture by
author Jacobo Timerman at
Washington and Lee University
has been indefinately postponed
due to Timerman’s illness.

Timerman had originally
been scheduled to speak at W&L
on Oct. 20. That presentation
was postponed and rescheduled
for Nov. 3.

Marty Harmon, co-chairman
of the student organization
sponsoring the lecture, ‘‘Con-
tact ’83,’”’ said that no future

 

date has been set for Timer-
man’s lecture but ind‘cated the
speaker sypmosium still hoped
to sponsor the lecture at a
future date.

Correction

In the last issue of The Ring-
tum Phi, the Student Affairs
Committee was _ incorrectly
described as a body made up of
class officers. In fact the SAC is
a faculty-student disciplinary
committee.

Pryor returns in film

Shows typical taste for tasteless

By COLE DAWSON
Special to the Phi

Richard Pryor once again
shows his rare talent in his new
movie “Here and Now.” The
film is set in New Orleans and is
his latest stage show. Pryor
lives up to Bourbon Street’s
age-old reputation with his flair
for the unexpected. He keeps
his audience, both on and off the
screen riveted with laughter.

In natural Pryor fashion, he
tantalizes and provokes his au-
dience with his usual taste for
the tasteless. I would not
recommend taking your mother
to see this film, unless of course

she is a mudwrestler and chews
Red Man at the dinner table.
Pryor has an innate ability to
bring himself across well to his
audience. He is very comfor-
table on stage and his dialogue
flows very well. His man-
nerisms speak for themselves
and are an integral part of the
show.

He brings the topics of drink-
ing and drugs to bear through-
out, and emphasizes the fact
that he has done neither for
seven months. If Pryor has ac-
tually made this commitment it
is hard to deduce from this film.
One almost gets the feeling that

he is making a_ statement
against drug abuse and alcohol,
but at the same time his is
ironically seeming to condone
them through much of his act.

The movie is good, but begins
to drag in the last half hour. For
Pryor fans it will be most en-
joyable; but for the more sedate
group, that would like to be
entertained by something more
than South Bronx vocabulary at
best, this one is not recommend-
ed. I give the film an average
rating. “Here and Now’’ is
entertaining, but I can only sit
still for so long and listen to any
comedian.

New display combines arts

“Extensions: In Time and
Space,”’ an installation by Bir-
mingham, Ala., artist Edith
Frohock will be in the duPont
Gallery from Nov. 1-18.

The exhibit includes an
unusual collection of painting,
drawings, sculpture, and con-
temporary synthesized music
written by Doug Carroll which
plays continuously while the
gallery is open.

According to the artist the in-
stallation will appear simul-
taneously in three different
locations — Washington and
Lee, the University of Alabama

 

 

in Birmingham, and Vanderbilt
University in Nashville, Tenn.
All the exhibits will feature the
same musical composition and
similar paintings and sculpture.
According to Debora Rindge,
art instructor and director of
the duPont Gallery, a viewer
traveling from Birmingham to
Nashville to Lexington would
notice the exhibit gradually
become more complex.
Frohock says she ‘frequently
felt the need to be in more than
one place at the same time. One
show opening simultaneously in
three different states allows me

Roberto yearns for a simpler,

“El Super’ provides the
viewer with a_ refreshingly
human perspective on Hispanic

working-class people who fled
Castro’s revolution, this work is
not really about politics. In-
stead, ‘El Super’ is a funny
and poignant film which deals
intelligently with the plight of
displaced persons in an alien
society. As one reviewer has
said, “El Super” is ‘an ex-
tremely enjoyable experience
to be shared by anyone possess-
ing a normal complement of
human sympathy.”

Generals again, will
try a fourth time

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
water polo team came away
with second place in_ the
Virginia State Championships
last weekend in Richmond, Va.
The Generals lost in the finals to
tournament champion Rich-
mond by a score of 9-4.

The Generals qualified for the
tournament finals by defeating
the University of Virginia 13-4
in the semi-finals. Tim Rock
scored four of the Generals’
goals against UVa.

Concerning the Richmond
game, head water polo coach
Page Remillard said, ‘“Rich-
mond took charge right away

  

IN

and we were never in the
game.”’

C-rated officials called the A-
rated game between W&L and
Richmond. But Coach Remil-
lard believes that W&L would
have lost anyway if A-rated of-
ficals had judged the game. He
did state, however, that Rich-
mond took advantage of the
referees’ inexperience and shut
down the Generals’ offense.

This weekend W&L will host
the Southern League Champion-
ships Tournament. Action will
begin Saturday morning.

The championships will be
the last regular season event for
the Southern League. The top

Canfield sees tough road

By PETER WRIGHT
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
University basketball team has
begun practicing for the upcom-
ing season, and basketball
coach Verne Canfield said his
team will have a very tough
year with only two returning
starters and a difficult schedule
this season.

The Generals only returning
starters are Chris Baldwin, a
5-9, 155-lb. guard, and John Lee
Graves, a 6-5, 190-lb. forward.
Both of the seniors were
selected as the team’s co-
captains.

Last season, Baldwin averag-
ed 2.8 points per game and had
58 assists for the Generals.
Graves, who has started for
W&L since his freshman year,
averaged 15.2 points and 6.7 re-
bounds a game last year.

With a young, inexperienced
team and a demanding sche-
dule which includes 11 games on
the road and eight at home,
Canfield said that two seniors
will definitely play a crucial
role in the success of the team.
“We will be looking toward
them for leadership,’ Canfield
said.

This year’s team includes
eight new players and two new
assistant coaches, according to
Canfield.

The problem with having an
inexperienced team is that a
review course over the basics
and fundamentals of basketball
is necessary at the beginning of
the year, Canfield explained.
He said that taking the time to
teach the new players the
basics will help eliminate some
of those inevitable mistakes a
player will make while in the
game.

“‘We will not make a mistake
that we won’t learn from,” he
added.

This year’s schedule will also
pose some problems for the

Generals, Canfield said. He
stated that most of the con-
ference (ODAC) teams will be
returning three or more
starters and that defending
ODAC champion Roanoke Col-
lege will be particularly strong.
Canfield described this year’s
schedule as a bad one and said
if he had known his team would
be lacking in experience, he
would not have formed such a
difficult schedule. Pointing out
the first seven to nine games as
being particularly tough, Can-
field said he is still optimistic.
“‘T think everybody we play will
know they’ve been in a basket-
ball game,”’ he said.

Although W&L has a lot of
work and preparation to do
before their opening game in
the W&L Tip-Off Tournament
Nov. 18, Canfield said he was
having m n this year. “I
didn’t enjoy coaching that much
last year,”’ he said. Last year’s

team finished with a 17-10
record, but Canfield said there
was no togetherness on last
year’s squad while referring to
this year’s team as one that has
a positive attitude and is willing
to work hard. ‘We believe in
one another,” Canfield said.
‘We have super people, and I
think we can win with super
people.”

Although last year’s team had
more individual ability, they
did not play their best, Canfield
said. ‘‘I want to see this year’s
team play up to its fullest poten-
tial and beyond.”’

Strategically, the Generals
will use a multiple offense and
defense this year, meaning that
the team will be constantly
changing their offenses and
defenses based on the game
conditions and _ personnel
availiable.

The development of the new,
inexperienced players is just a
matter of time, Canfield said.
“‘] definitely feel we will be a
factor (in the ODAC) and we
will work hard,” he said.

Baldwin and Graves also feel
the team will develop and are
optimistic about the upcoming
season.

Speaking of the younger
players, Baldwin said, ‘‘after
they get some game time, they
will be all right.”

According to Graves, the new
players ‘‘will grow up in a
hurry.”’

The two co-captains also said
they were looking forward to
the challenge of leading the
team, and they both have their
goals in mind.

“T just hope I can look back
after the season is over and say
we did the best we could,”
Baldwin said.

Graves mentioned that he
would like to make the All-
Conference team but stated his
overall goal was to do what he
could to make the team come
together as it should.”

Generals clip BC Eagles, 42-

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee foot-
ball Generals combined big
plays early in the game and a
devastating ground game to
snap a two-game losing streak
with a 42-7 thrashing of the
Bridgewater College Eagles
Saturday.

For the second time this
season, W&L returned the open-
ing kickoff for a touchdown and
never looked back. This time
sophomore Chris Bleggi ignited
the Generals with his 90-yard
return on the opening play, giv-
ing W&L a 7-0 lead only 13
seconds into the game.

“Once again we managed to
get a real big boost from the
opening kick-off, just like we
did against Maryville when we
ran that one back for the
touchdown,”’ head coach Gary
Fallon said.

The Generals added two more
first-quarter touchdowns as

 

Girard, White
jearn kudos

Gene Girard, a junior
tailback from Coral Gables,
Fla., needs only five points in
the last two games to set a new
school record for scoring in a
single season. The record of 64
points was established by Bob
Funkhouser in 1959.

Girard has already tied the
single season mark for touch-
downs with 10, sharing that
record with Chris Cavalline. On
the season, Girard has amassed
712 yards on 148 carries and has
an outside chance of reaching
1,000 yards for the season in the
last two games.

Placekicker James White is
also nearing a school record. He
needs only two more point-
after-touchdown kicks to break
Bill Devine’s single-season
record of 23 set in 1981.

 

 

 

       
  

Rick Swagler)

Charlie Alcorn’s interception
set up the first, a 10-yard run by
tailback Gene Girard. Later in
the quarter, quarterback Bobby
Wilson hit tight end Ian Banwell
for a 17-yard touchdown. After
James White added the third of
his six PAT’s, W&L had a 21-0
lead.

This lead was increased early
in the second quarter after
Frank Surface scored on a one-
yard run. After White’s kick,
the Generals led 28-0 and the
score remained the same until
halftime.

In the third quarter W&L put
the game out of reach as Gene
Girard scored on runs of 46 and
three yards, making the score
42). Bridgewater’s lone score
came just before the end of the
third quarter when Eagle
quarterback Randy Bleeden hit
Pete Ritchie for 55 yards for a
touchdown. Stefan South’s ex-
tra point finished the scoring for
the day, making the final score
42-7.

The Generals’ victory was
keyed by a strong rushing at-
tack led by Girard (15 carries,
120 yards) and Surface (13 car-
ries, 84 yards). Of the 361 total
yards of offense, only 17 of them
came through the air as the
Eagles were unable to stop the
W&L ground game.

“Gene and Frank ran excep-
tionally well all afternoon. But
then so did everybody else,”’
Fallon said. “Girard continues
to improve every week. Frank
gave us good blocking and also
had his best day running the
ball. Up front, we were pleased
with the way our linemen open-
ed holes,’’ he added.

Defense also was a bright
spot for the Generals. Bridge-
water was unable to establish a
rushing attack and was forced
to resort to the pass. They found
some success via the pass (12 of
30, 196 yards), but had three
passes intercepted and could

muster only one score against

the stubborn General defense.
Fallon singled out defensive end
Charlie Alcorn for making ‘“‘two
crucial plays by intercepting
one pass to set up our second
touchdown and by trapping the
quarterback for a loss in a key
situation.”

The Generals will host the
Catholic University Cardinals
this Saturday in Lexington.
Catholic is 4-4 on the year and
promises to be a dangerous op-

ponent. This is the last meeting
between the two schools as
Catholic has decided to leave
the ODAC after this year.

“We would certainly like to
end the series with a victory,”
Fallon stated. He added that
Catholic ‘‘could have the best

balance, offensively and defen-
sively, of any team we've
played. I certainly hope we’re
ready to play.”

It’s no go co,
at least from an
athletic perspective

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

...Well, it seems I can no
longer avoid commenting on
that dreaded topic looming over
our heads these past weeks.
Anyway, the big boys decided to
devote this issue to it, so I might
as well comply with a few
choice quips on ... shh... coedu-
cation and its relation to the
staid athletic tradition here at
W&L. Mr. Doremus most cer-
tainly is turning in his grave as
the thought of women wearing
the royal blue and white is being
bantered about. I most certain-
ly concur with his resting soul,
as well as some living ones to-
day. Admitting women would
naturally entail the develop-
ment of women’s athletic pro-
grams (see Title IX) and with
that athletics at W&L would be
on that slippery slope toward in-
escapable mediocrity. First,
the refurbishing costs of the
gym would be a matter of con-
cern. Second, with women
would come the need for a re-
vamped — and, in turn, perhaps
restrained — physical educa-
tion program. Third, the effects
on the staff in the athletic
department would be quite
detrimental as many coaches
would have to leave, their spots
to be taken over by the new
women’s sports coaches. Four-
th, adding women’s sports
would most probably mean los-
ing some men’s sports simply
because only so many can be
supported by the university. In

turn, the big sports such as
lacrosse, football, basketball
would have their choice of
players cut in half, making
recruitment twice as difficult as
itis now. The decline would thus
continue as with a smaller
group to select from there

Time out..,

would be fewer better athletes.
The W&L athletic department,
which has earned respect in re-
cent years, would then not be
able to produce the quality
teams it has prided itself upon.
From this there is the very real
possibility that dissatisfaction
athletically speaking would
lead to the abandoning of the
Division III non-scholarship,
true student-athlete philosophy.
The quick fix of athletic
scholarships would become a
reality, and well then we’d be
one of many in the sea of
mediocrity instead of the island
of supremacy W&L athletics
have developed into. No, there
is no debate here. The coeduca-
tion process would be more
trouble than it’s worth. Truer
words perhaps were never
spoken...

..We got congrats galore
for this weekend’s Colonnade:
crusaders. Jay Werner with.
four shutouts and the General
soccer group are playing like
they’ve deserved all season.

Werner claims fourth
shutout as soccer splits two

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

Sophomore forward Bill
Holmes scored a goal in each
game this week as the Gener-
als’ soccer team split two away
games, defeating Catholic
University, 3-0, on Saturday,
and losing in overtime, 3-2, to
Radford University on Tues-
day.

The victory over Catholic
ended the ODAC season for the
Generals, who finished at 3-3 in
the conference. Lynchburg Col-
lege, which defeated W&L, 2-1,
on Oct. 19, took the ODAC title
witha 5-1 record.

Tuesday’s defeat at Radford
left W&L with a 7-5 record with
one game remaining, a 10:00
a.m. match this Saturday
against Emory University on
Wilson Field.

Although the Generals failed
to capture the ODAC title, head
coach Rolf Piranian is happy

-with the way his team has

developed this season. “‘As a
team we’ve improved, clearly.
We’ve scored more goals and
played better defense,”’ said the
eighth-year coach.

Holmes, Gary Clements, and
freshman Ken Randby scored
the goals against Catholic. The
shutout was the fourth of the
season for junior goalie Jay
Werner, who has a 1.33 goals
against average per game. The
W&L shutout record is seven in
a season and 11 ina career.

Against Radford Holmes and
Steve McGrath gave the Gener-
als a 2-) lead, which they held
going into the final two minutes.
Radford scored with 1:39 left,
however, to send the game into
overtime, then ended the game
seven minutes into the first
overtime with the winning goal.

Holmes now has five goals
and seven assists on the season,
for 17 total points. Senior co-
captain Roland Simon, with six
goals and four assists, has 16
points.

 

An Open Letter from
Lloyd’s of Lexington

Dear Washington & Lee Students:
When we opened our restaurant 3 years ago, we did so hoping

 

that Lloyd’s would become a popular place for students to come
with their friends for a quick meal. We added the most popular
video games in the country to provide a little entertainment in a
conservative town that lacks a lot in the entertainment field.
You have been good to use.

In the past 12 months, Dominos and Arby’s have entered into
the fast food market and sliced the pie. There are only so many
dollars to be spent on food.

One thing that is unique about our ‘‘Lloyd’s of Lexington,”’ is
that the owner works and manages his store, which keeps him in.
touch with the needs of the community. We have responded to
the needs of you students by operating 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week. But, with this, we have excess overhead to pay.

I can tell you that we have tried for the past 3 years to provide
a quality product, with fast, courteous service, in a clean
restaurant. Some businesses would have you to believe that your
business does not matter. Let me be the first to say, if it were not
for Washington and Lee students, Lloyd’s of Lexington would
not survive. ;

We will continue to provide specials to build business. We hope
you will take advantage of these specials, as you could save
some money.

We will be purchasing two of the latest new ‘‘laser disc’’ video
games next week, Dragon’s Lair, and Mach III. These games
are intense. Come by and let them blow your mind.

Please friends, think twice before spending your money in
chain food stores. Your money will be invested back into this
business, to better it, which will benefit you in the long run. As
we celebrate our 3rd anniversary, I would like say thank you; a
million thank you’s for making Lloyd’s better today than yester-
day. Help us make it better tomorrow than it is today.

Respectfully,
Lloyd W. Smith Jr.

1980 student survey leans toward coeducation
Honors thesis finds 50% in favor of change

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

Over half of Washington and
Lee students and three-quarters
of W&L faculty members polled
several
coeducation, according to a
sociology honors thesis by
David Bowen, who graduated
last spring.

Students in Sociology 375
(Research Methods) distrib-
uted questionnaires to students
registering for classes during
the winter semester of 1980. Of
1,200 students, 1,050 returned
the questionnaires, a number
that Bowen said makes the
survey representative and
significant.

Of those 1,050 students, 527, or
50.2 percent, favored coeduca-
tion, and 453, or 43.1 percent, op-
posed coeducation. Six percent
had no opinion.

Bowen was not involved with
conducting this survey, but he

   
 

in the fall of 1981 through inter-
campus mail. Creating essen-
tially the same questionnaire as
that distributed to the students,
he found that the faculty greatly
favored coeducation.

Of the 92 faculty members
who responded, 76.9 percent
favored coeducation, 19.8 per-
cent opposed coeducation and
3.3 percent had no opinion.
Although only 68 percent of the
faculty members responded,
Bowen said it was a represen-
tative sample and thus could be
generalized to the faculty as a
whole.

Bowen said his findings were
“surprising to those who are

H-SC, VMI

(continued from page 4)

Both Drew and Settle said
that Hampden-Sydney’s ap-
plications for admission would
probably not increase a great
deal if W&L went coed.

Drew said that only a small
percentage of freshmen enter-
ing Hampden-Sydney listed the
all-male environment as the
main reason they chose the
school. Nevertheless, Drew said
that at least two-thirds of the

years ago favored ©

did survey the faculty members

adamantly opposed to coeduca-
tion. It was surprising to me.”’

Bowen said he felt that even
though nearly all students who
were surveyed have graduated
(last year’s seniors would have
been freshmen then), the sur-
vey probably comes close to re-
flecting current student at-
titudes about coedcuation at
W&L. However, both Bowen
and Dr. David Novack, who
helped him with the project,
pointed out that a_ similar
survey today might not reflect
those attitudes.

“When that survey was
taken,’”’ Bowen said, ‘‘the issue
was not as hot as it is now.
Students know if they’re asked
the same questions now, that
they’re being put on the spot
and what they have to say
might really be important.

“TI don’t see students as
changing as that much,”’ he ad-
ded. “‘But their attitudes might
be clouded a bit by the heat of

   

the issue right now.”

Reading Bowen’s 120-page
thesis, some __ interesting
phenomena come to light.

Using a series of demo-
graphic variables, Bowen found
little relationship between a stu-
dent’s year in school or his ma-
jor and his feeling toward
coeducation. However, he did
find that 36.8 percent of frater-
nity members were strongly op-
posed to coeducation, while 17.8
percent of independents were
strongly opposed, and 42.4 per-

cent strongly supportive.
Bowen also discovered that

72.8 percent of students from
the Northeast favored coeduca-
tion while 34.4 percent from the

 

students are strongly in favor of
remaining all-male.

Capt. O. Lawrence Burnette
Jr., Public Information Direc-
tor at VMI, said that it would be
improper for any offical at VMI
to comment on W&L’s study of
the coed question.

“We have no intention of
changing our all-male status,”
Burnette said.

Burnette said that he would
not elaborate on that statement.

   
   

South favored it. Forty-five per-
cent of the Southerners were
strongly opposed. Virginia,
Maryland and the District of
Columbia were not included in
any regional classification, and
the breakdown in those areas
was fairly similar to that of the
student sample as a whole.

The student questionnaire
also asked if W&L’s all-male
status was a positive or
negative factor in a student’s
decision to enroll at W&L. 23.1
percent said it was a positive
factor and 33.4 percent said it
was a negative factor. However
these numbers were generally
in the minor positive and minor
negative categories rather than
the major positive and major
negative categories. 447
students, or 42.5 percent, said
the single-sex status had no ef-
fect on their decision to enroll.

An objective question, ‘Is
coeducation in the best interest
of W&L as a quality institu-
tion?’’ was also asked. Bowen
found “a shift in sentiment”
between whether a_ student
thought W&L should go coed
and whether it was in the
school’s best interest.

Many students who did not
want the school to go coed
seemed to believe that coeduca-
tion was in the school’s best in-
terest. For example, 29.4 per-
cent, or 309, of the students said
they were strongly opposed to
coeducation. However, 191, or
19.2 percent said it was strongly
not in W&L’s best interest to go
coed.

In terms of the advantages
and disadvantages of coeduca-
tion, W&L students saw a
“more natural and improved

Dr. David Novack advised a W&L student who found support for coeducation.

social atmosphere as the most
important advantage” rather
than academic advantages. The
biggest disadvantage seen by
students was ‘“‘loss of. tradi-
tion.” :

The faculty survey produced
some opposite opinions, though.
The increasing acadcmic pool
and better academics were
cited more frequently as advan-
tages of coeduation than was
the factor of a better social en-
vironment.

Faculty members also named
the expenses involved in going
coeducational and the possible
loss of alumni support as well as
the loss of tradition as disad-
vantages of going coed.

Additional analysis showed
that many faculty members
thought female students would
enhance the academic, social
and classroom environments.

**'.the faculty desire compe-
tent students,’”’ Bowen wrote.
“It looks as though the faculty
are calling for coeducation and
the improved academics which
would follow.”

In his final section, Bowen
wrote, “The majority of stu-
dents believe that the social at-
mosphere at W&L is lacking,
lacking in women and thus
naturalness.”

One question asked students
if they would choose W&L
again. 47 percent of the students
said they ‘‘were not happy
enough with the school to say
they would choose it again.”’ 522
of the 1,050 respondents would
choose W&L again.

In addition, there is a strong
relationship between whether a
student would choose W&L
again and whether he thought

ste

     

W&L should go coed. Students
who would not choose W&L
tended to be in favor of coeduca-
tion, and vice versa.

“This table certainly is
evidence of student dissatisfac-
tion and that this discontent-
ment is related to W&L’s being
an all-male institution,’’ Bowen
wrote.

In the conclusion to the sum-
mary of his report Bowen
wrote, “These two surveys...ap-
pear to indicate that the current
W&L ‘mood’ favors coeduca-
tion.”

And in the introduction to his
main report, he wrote, ‘‘What I
have found more commonly
seems to be a sort of tolerance
rather than a celebration for
single-sex education.

“Although Washington and
Lee’s single-sex student body is
an attractive option for some
students, many others seem
stigmatized. Many students feel
awkward about the single-sex
nature of their school.’’

In an interview earlier this
week from the University of
Richmond, where he is a law
student, Bowen said, “‘I was op-
posed to coeducation before I
did all the research. I was very
concerned about W&L’s tradi-
tions and I still am. I’m very
proud of the school. But I think
it can be better.

“T think it loses out on good
Students and some of the pres-
tige it could have if it were coed.
“A lot of people are not that
informed on the issue,” he con-
cluded. “‘If they had both sides
of the issue, a lot more people
who are opposed to coeducation
might be in favor of it.”

Athletic ‘headaches’ possible

By PAUL CLARK
Staff Reporter

While much has been written
ibout the subject of coeduca-
ion, problems of athletic facili-
y renovation, coaching and re-
‘ruitment have not been
yrought up. According to Wash-
ngton and Lee Athletic Direc-
or Bill McHenry, coeducation
vould cause ‘‘a_ lot of
ieadaches”’ in the halls of
Joremus Gym and on Wilson
Field.

Coach McHenry has _ been
busy conducting his own re-
search into the matter ever
since the issue of coeducation
was re-raised. This Friday,

McHenry plans to offer to the
University Athletic Committee
his findings concerning the in-
tegration of a women’s athletic
program into the W&L athletic
department. He hopes his re-
port will serve as advice and
counsel to the committee, the
faculty and President Wilson,
he said.

The U.A.C. is an advisory
committee which, according to
Dr. George Ray, chairman of
the committee, ‘‘exists to ad-
vise the president and the ath-
letic director on all matters per-
taining to the athletic pro-

gram.”’

The committee is composed
of six faculty members as well
as two alumni and three student
representatives. The three stu-
dent members on this year’s
committee are Marty Bechtold
(784), Ian Banwell (’85) and
Gordon Ogden (’85). Dr. Ray
urges students to use these
representatives to com-
municate student opinion on the
matter of coeducation. How-
ever, Dr. Ray emphasized, ‘I
have not been directed by the
President to look at coeducation
(in sports) in any formal way.
We have held informal discus-
sions in case coeducation be-
comes a reality, and have iden-
tified areas in which coeduca-
tion would have an impact.”

Ray also said that at this
point, or until a decision can be
made on the issue, nothing de-
finitive can be said.

McHenry outlines in his re-
port several of his concerns
about the athletic department
should it be forced to ‘‘go coed.”’
One of the many problems with
the aspect of coeducation is
simple logistics and a lack of
space. Current conditions are
grossly inadequate for any
change of the student body in
sports. he said. Making a sports

program coed these days re-
quires an expense of hundreds
of thousands of dollars.
McHenry also cites a terrible
shortage of field space for such
a change.

“We're dealing with a lot of
money when talking about

renovation on this major a

scale,”’ he said.

There is currently not enough
field space to support football,
lacrosse, soccer and baseball
for the men. as well as field
hockey, lacrosse, soccer and
softball for women’s teams,
McHenry said. In addition, for
the women’s teams to be able to
join and to participate in con-
ference championships, W&L
must have a minimum of four
varsity women’s teams. Final-
ly, to make the sports program
coed, other space than just field
space must be found, McHenry
said.

At this point, there is no space
for the addition of locker rooms
for female athletes. Such space
would call for major renovation
of current facilities and addi-
tional construction to provide
adequate facilities. Office
space, said McHenry, is
already a prized possession and
there is absolutely no more
room for offices in the gym

 

unless drastic work occurs in
that department also.

Another aspect coeducation
would bring is the operational
difficulty to the athletic depart-
ment. There would have to be
provisions in the budget, said
McHenry, that ‘‘would allow the
hiring of new coaches, interns
and administrators’ to cope
with the change in the depart-
ment. Almost all of the new per-
sonnel would have to be women
“so we are in compliance with
Title [X,”” McHenry said. (Title
IX is an NCAA rule and federal
regulation which states that
equal facilities and equal oppor-
tunities must be present for
men and women in a coeduca-
tional school.) Coach McHenry

Athletic Director Bill McHenry

 

 

 

added, “‘I don’t think Title IX
would allow an all-male staff to
coach a coed sports program.”’
Here, McHenry is faced with
possible cutbacks in his current
staff to allow the hiring of
female coaches, trainers, in-
terns and administrators that
will be required.

“I would hate to think that we
would have to force some of the
staff from their jobs because of
budget problems entailed by go-
ing coed,”’ he said.

Other budget problems exist.
Somewhere in the endowment
or through outside contributions
must come the funds which will
enable W&L to add all of the
women’s sports to the program:
field hockey, volleyball, la-
crosse, softball, cross country,
track, swimming, golf and ten-
nis. Of these, says McHenry,

Powell, Mudd, Dobyns comment

Three prominent W&L alum-
ni — Supreme Court Justice
Lewis G. Powell, Roger Mudd
and Lloyd Dobyns — also ex-
pressed opinions on coeducation
in interviews with the Ring-tum
Phi this week.

Powell (’29, ’31L) declined
comment on the coeducation
situation “because of my posi-
tion on the Court’’ and ‘“‘because
I don’t know enough about it.’’

Justice Powell said that
‘‘within the last month”’ he had
sent a letter to President Wilson
expressing his views on coedu-
cation.

However, the Justice says
now that ‘‘that letter was not
written in light of some infor-
mation about population trends
that is now being assembled.”’

In a recent decision of the
United States Supreme Court
involving the Mississippi Col-
lege for Women, a state institu-
tion that had been unisex for
many years, the justices upheld
that the all-women policy was
discriminatory since it was a
government school.

 

“WE&L is not

about to go broke.

I don’t agree

that it’s something

that has to be
done

by September.”
—Lloyd Dobyns

 

In a dissenting opinion to the
5-4 decision, Justice Powell ex-
pressed his view that the oppor-
tunity for a choice was an op-
portunity tlt was worth pre-
serving in the courts. That
diversity, he wrote, was a
characteristic of both the
United States and its popula-
tion, and was a tradition. The
country, Justice Powell said,
was made up of diversity.

He also made reference in the
dissenting opinion to the tradi-
tion of excellence which many
women’s colleges had achieved,
including some of the local
women’s colleges. They have
produced superb academic op-
portunities, he said.

Mudd (’50), a correspondent
for NBC News, said, ‘‘My view
is that I’m in favor of retaining
a few good all-male schools.”
He also said said he thinks there
should be some quality all-fe-
male institutions.

As a member of the Board of
Trustees of Randolph-Macon
Woman’s College from 1971 to
1978, Mudd observed an experi-
ment they conducted with coed-
ucation. “It never really work-
ed out satisfactorily for
anybody,” he recalls.

“The women regarded the
men as nuisances. The men felt
set apart — they didn’t feel they
had the facilities. They became
sort of cranks.”’

Mudd was unimpressed by
some of the arguments in favor
of coeducation that are cir-
culating. ‘‘I never felt deprived
of any social experience or any
sort of knowledge that I needed.
We had fairly easy access,” he
said.

He also remarked, “I never
heard that W&L is in financial
trouble.”

Dobyns (’57), editor and an-
chor of NBC News’s “First
Camera,”’ said, “I wouldn’t be
in favor of it. I’m not against it,

  

,

Roger Mudd ( W&L *50)

but I’d have to know a good
reason for it.’’

Dobyns said that the declin-
ing pool of students is a reality,
but “‘to do something because it
is economically desirable is a
very poor reason.

“W&L is not about to go
broke. I don’t agree that it’s
something that has to be done
by September. I know better
than that.’’

“The reasons for having them
are the better argument,’ he
continued. ‘‘That’s the way we
live. If we could all go back to
Victorian clubs, that would be

‘ fine, but we can’t...It thay well

be that these students will work
in a company headed by a wom-
an and think nothing of it.”

W&L students, Dobyns says,
can sometimes get unaccustom-
ed to that attitude toward
women. “When I was here,
women were quite pleasant
starting at 2 p.m. on Friday,
and as long as they were gone
by Sunday night, no harm was
done, and maybe even some
good.

 

_ History

“God knows that was true.
That was undeniably true. It’s
an invalid attitude and is
counterproductive to the liberal
arts education. You can’t argue
for it.’’

“If you’re not used to coping
with something, you’re going to
have difficulties dealing with
it,” Dobyns said. With coeduca-
tion, ‘‘the easiest way to deal
with it would be to say,‘Ha! Ha!
They’ve let a few of the play
things in permanently so that
those of us who want to can play
for seven days instead of two.’ ”’

While the traditional attitudes

about women may not be ap- .

plicable to today’s world, he
says “‘it is also true, whether we
like it or not, that it is easier to
pay attention in class when
there’s nothing to look at be-
sides the blackboard. It is very
difficult not to look at a good-
looking woman.”

If the implementation of
coeducation were being con-

sidered, Dobyns says, ‘‘I would
hope that they would consult the
students, and even go some-
what beyond that.

“It would be interesting to
talk to the future students of
W&L. See what they have to say
about it. The future students are
going to be the ones who have to
live with this.’’

Dobyns was asked his reac-
tion to two slogans being used
by anti-coeducation students on
campus. if

“Better Dead Than Coed”’:
“‘That’s the dumbest thing I’ve
ever heard. What a silly thing to
say. W&L is not going to be de-
stroyed because it lets women
in. That’s pathetically dumb.
Whether it’s desirable is
another question.”

“Girls in the Hay, but not All
Day’’: ‘‘Physiologically,
women are capable of doing
what they do in the hay for the
whole day. Men aren’t.’’

—Mike Allen

 

(continued from page 2)

The recommendation of that
study was to remain all-male.
“They didn’t close the door,”
said Parsons, ‘“‘but they found
no compelling reason at that
time for the University to aban-
don an academic role it had
been filling for a long time —
usefully and successfully.’’

Throughout the _ period,
Huntley consistently consulted
with presidents of recently
coeducated schools, said Par-
sons.

‘‘He was friends with a group.

of presidents of schools that
were similar in size and educa-
tional character to W&L. He
received a lot of good informa-
tion from highly regarded
peers,’’ said Parsons.

decides to go coed, if they are
ever going to do so.

“The general climate is that
there is a greater urgency for
them to make their decision and
get on with it.”

According to Parsons, the
students this year, in com-
parison with years past, ‘‘are
more active in their response
and seem more inclined to come

a eat ate at eaaninaem ate tp

to the defense of the status "a

quo.”

“There is a new element in
student reaction as well,’’ said
Parsons. Students feel more
personally threatened than they
have in previous years, an at-
titude Parsons attributes at
least partially to a fear of a
“potential for change in their
social patterns.”

While Parsons is still ‘‘per-
sonally wrestling’ with the
question, he cited Huntley’s
1968 Parent’s Weekend com-
ment as being as ‘‘true today as
ever.”” When asked when W&L
was going to go coed, Huntley
responded that he did not know
if or when the change would oc-
cur, but that “W&L, with our
history, could not be allowed to
go out of business providing an
alternative no one wants,’’ Par-
sons said.

Fifteen years later, his words
have a hauntingly familiar
sound.

Let’s make sure of our facts and figures
before we make an irreversible change.

Drop in student
market projected

By RICK SWAGLER
Chief Editor

The Washington and Lee
Class of 1996 will only number
265, a drop of 104 students as
compared with the class of 1986,
according to the Admissions Of-
fice Demographics report for
the faculty. The prediction is
based on the assumption that
the economy and federal finan-
cial aid situations remain stable
and that the two classes are
academically comparable.

These figures — from the Na-
tional Center for Education
Statistics — are based on the
study’s prediction that the 18-
year-old population will dwindle
making admissions more com-
petitive among colleges.

Associate Director of Admis-
sions, Van H. Pate pointed out
that beyond 1992 “there is
another bubble.” Pate said that
the children of ‘‘baby-boom”
babies will be entering college.

Pate discounted this increase,
though, saying it was ‘‘flatter
and not as “‘wide.”’

Adults from the baby-boom
era, Pate said, are having fewer
children and are having them
later in life.

According to the study,
W&L’s 15-state market which
has accounted for over 84 per-
cent of the student enrollment

in the past five years, is ex-
pected to suffer a 22 percent
decline in 18-year-olds between
1982 and 1992. (See accompany-
ing graph.)

W&L’s five-state market (ex-
cluding Texas), which has ac-
counted for nearly half the
enrollment over the past five
years, is expected to drop by 33
percent. Only Texas is pre-
dicted to post a gain, .02 per-
cent,

The 15-state market is of key
importance to W&L, according
to the report, because it ac-
counts for 84 percent of both the
accepted pool and the enrolling
class.

According to Pate, the bulk of
the statistics, particularly the
15-state market projections are
from the national report but,
“the Center also ran some
special searches for us.’’

The Admissions Office has
also prepared a breakdown on
the number of students who
possess characteristics typical-
ly found in W&L students.

eMales who score 500 or more
on the verbal section of the SAT

eMales who also score 550 or
better on the Math section of the
SAT, and

top 2/5ths of their class and
have a ‘B’ average or better.

Coed issue

By B. SCOTT TILLEY
Staff Reporter

This generation of
Washington and Lee gentlemen
is not the first to confront the

issue of coeducation. As early .

as 1896, the faculty considered
the possibility of coeducation,
voting the idea down. In 1902, it
was again br t up, and
again it was defeated in a vote
of the faculty.

In recent years, most of the
remaining all-male schools, in-
cluding Harvard, Yale, Prince-
ton, and Virginia, have decided
to go coed. Their decisions led
W&L twice to consider the ques-
tion of coeducation — in 1969
and 1975.

  

addressed before

‘Many of those schools were
making changes for pedagogi-
cal reasons, to enrich their
overall educational experi-
ences,” said Frank Parsons,
the executive assistant to the
president and a 1965 graduate of
W&L, from his office in Wash-
ington Hall.

‘Many others, though, looked
ahead and saw difficulties for
themselves. Student recruit-
ment possibilities were enhanc-
ed by the admissions of women.

“In that climate, in 1969, the
question was addressed here by
a faculty student committee,”’
said Parsons.

That committee, he explain-
ed, was deliberately ‘‘loaded’’
with proponents of coeducation
by then-President Robert E.R.

Huntley. They were charged
with looking at the issue and
determining the consequences
of going coed, ‘‘not necessarily
whether to go coed.”

The faculty committee
studied coeducation’s conse-
quences from two angles: from
that of simply adding women,
thereby increasing the student
body size, or from that of
substituting women, thereby
maintaining the same student
population.

The conclusions of the com-
mittee, explained Parsons,
were never made public or
acted upon. The Board of
Trustees, in response, simply
thanked the committee and ask-
ed Huntley to keep them
abreast of the situation.

The 1975 study was requested
by the Board of Trustees pro-

‘bably at the request one year

earlier of the student body
president, remembered Par-
sons. He was a law student who
had not attended W&L as an
undergraduate and who had run
emphasizing his pro-coeduca-
tion stance.

Dean Lewis John’s office pro-
vided the staff support for that
study, which Parson’s describ-
ed as “substantial.’’ John’s of-
fice consulted several schools
that had recently gone coed,
asking them to assess their
gains and losses, and asking for
faculty comment.

W&L Siadents
Board to examine issue with
great care, Ballengee says

By JOHN CLEGHORN
Chief Editor

Since formally making the
announcement that they will
reexamine the issue of coeduca-
tion at Washington and Lee, the
members of the W&L Board of
Trustees have adjourned until
their February meeting to
study the question and probe
the options, according to Board
Rector James M. Ballengee.

Ballengee said that the Board
plans to make a preliminary
study of the issue in February in
an effort to be ready to make a
final judgment at its May
meeting.

“‘We have been looking at pro-
jections that Bill Hartog and his
people have brought to us,”’ Bal-
lengee said. ‘‘and that, coin-
ciding with the arrival of the
new president of Washington
and Lee, has raised this issue
again.”

- Ballengee said that the Board
was given no particular direc-
tion on how to study the issue in
preparing for the vote.

‘‘We’re taking our lead from
President Wilson,” he said.

“I have not appointed any
committee or committees,’’ he
continued, ‘“‘my current think-
ing is that we would do this a
committee as a whole.”

“We will examine it in a very
careful and deliberate way.”’

Ballengee said that it would
be difficult to predict the pre-
sent opinion of the current
Board on the question and that
he thought the board would vote
as individuals.

“T don’t think there are any
factions on the Board,’’ he said.

The announcemcnt of four
new Board members to replace
retiring members is expected in
the next week. Although the
names of the new members
have not been announced yet,
Ballengee said he is in the pro-
cess of speaking to the can-
didates and that he foresees no
dramatic change in the senti-
ment of the Board because of
the transition.

“T don’t think the change will
affect the decision in any way,”’
he said.

In the press announcement
released arter the Board’s

meeting two weeks ago, Ballen-
gee wrote that the reexamina-
tion of the question stemmed
from the board’s ‘desire to
understand all of the options
before (it).’’ Ballengee men-
tioned alternatives of lowering
enrollment or lowering stan-
dards as the other viable ‘‘op-
tions.”

Ballengee agreed with Presi-
dent Wilson that the major con-
stituents in the decision are the
faculty, the alumni and the
students. He also said that pro-
spective students, college
counselors and citizens of Lex-
ington would be considered in

the decision.

He added that all of these con-
stituents would be informed of
any major actions by the Board
before its May decision.

“We're not going to handle
this like Grenada,” he said.
‘“‘We are going to keep people in-
formed.”

In a statement released after

the Board’s October meeting,
Ballengee wrote, ‘‘...American
colleges and universities are
now facing an unprecendented
fall-off in the number of high
school graduates who will enter
upon collegiate study.”’

Coeducation would be tough on fraternities

By PETER WRIGHT
Staff Reporter

The question of coeducation
and its possible effect on the
fraternity system at Washing-
ton and Lee is still lingering
around the campus, but accor-
ding to officials at the Universi-
ty of the South (Sewanee) and
Randolph-Macon College, two

In 1968 Seiter said Sewanee
had 800 males enrolled, while
only 380 were enrolled last year.

According to Seiter, the abili-
ty of the fraternities at Sewanee
to pay their bills has been ham-
pered by the decline of the num-
bers in the respective houses,
yet he added, “I think the
change in the social life has
been extremely positive.”’

 

“we do have a significant decline in

the number of males in fraternities.”

 

schools that changed their all-
male status and admitted
women over a decade ago,
coeducation has only had a
minimal effect on the survival
of the fraternities.

At the University of the South,
the arrival of women did not
pose any serious problem to the
fraternity system said the uni-
versity’s dean of men, Doug
Seiter. Seiter said that since the
decision to go coed in 1969, the
number of fraternities on the
university’s campus has re-
mained the same.

“Presently, we have the same
number of fraternities,’’ Seiter

said, but he added, ‘“‘we do have ©

a significant decline in the
number of males in frater-
nities.”

 

Seiter explained that the cam-
pus of the University of the
South is somewhat isolated with
no other colleges nearby, which
is not the case at W&L. As a re-
sult of the school’s accepting
coeducation, the students now
have many social outlets and
have parties every weekend,
Seiter said. Having graduated
from Sewanee in 1965, Seiter
said the school “has gained so
much more” by admitting
women.

Although many people at
Sewanee were afraid the
change would wipe out much of
the tradition of the school,
Seiter said, “‘we were able to
preserve what was of value of
the all-boys’ school.”’

Andrews agreed with Seiter
that the change to coeducation
has been for the better.

There have been no momen-
tous changes in the structure of
the fraternities, Andrews said.
Identical to Sewanee, the num-
ber of fraternities has remained
the same since the decision of
the school to go coed in 1972, An-
drews said.

Of course there are now fewer
males at the college, but An-
drews said, ‘‘there is simply no
problem at Randolph-Macon
with the student population.”

Andrews pointed out that the
relationships between the
males and females were not
healthy before women were ad-
mitted to the school.

“TI think Randolph-Macon was
not normal because women
came to campus for only social
purposes,”’ he said.

According to Andrews, wom-

said.

Meanwhile, here at W&L,
Dean of Students Lewis John
anticipates that if the school
does go coed, some fraternities
could run into trouble.

“Obviously, it’s going . to
make it tougher to keep all 17
fraternities on campus with
fewer males,” John said. He ad-
ded that he felt the social life

would still revolve around the
fraternities at W&L, but an-
ticipated that there would be
less ‘frenzy activity’? on
weekends and on Wednesday
nights.

John did point out that
previously at W&L over 80 per-

cent of the student body was af-
filiated with fraternities and if
the interest increased to that
point again, there would be less
of a problem with the stability
of the fraternities.

en have since been fully in-
tegrated into both the social en-
vironment and the student af-
fairs of the school.

“It’s all gone very well so far,

here the whole time,’’ Andrews

President of the the Inter-
fraternity Council Emery Ell-
inger said he does not foresee
the interest in fraternities in-
creasing with the advent of
coeducation.

“It is absurd to think W&L
fraternities will increase from
60 to 80 percent.”’ he said.

Ellinger explained that fra-
ternities will not have as many
members if women enter the
school and said that many of the

fraternities would fold because
of their inability to fulfil] their
financial responsibilities.

Ellinger also said, ‘...the
W&L fraternity system has
been so strong because of its be-
ing an all-male school surround-
ed by five girls’ schools.”’

Surrounding
women’s colleges

fear coed W&L

By NELSON PATTERSON
Staff Reporter

If W&L were to go coed,
neighboring women’s colleges
say they fear the ‘‘new W&L”’
might, in the long run, irrevers-
ibly harm the social life and
academic life of their schools.
While none of the schools
believe such a move would
force them to go coed also, they
acknowledge that there will be
immediate effects.

One of these effects will be on
the social life W&L shares with
neighboring schools. All of the
area women’s colleges feel the
close social network developed
over the years would be broken
by coeducation.

“Mary Baldwin and Washing-
ton and Lee have always had
close social ties, but I believe
that we would have to recon-
sider those ties if coeducation
comes to light. We are close to
Hampden-Sydney also because
of our Presbyterian ties,’’ said

Kris Milker, admissions
counselor at Mary Baldwin Col-
lege.

The Director of Public Rela-
tions for Sweet Briar agrees
that the social environment
would change.

“One can only speculate as to
the effect of coeducation
academically, but socially I’m
sure it would be there. Sweet
Briar students spend a great
deal of time with W&L students,
and women at the W&L campus
would affect that to some ex-
tent,” said Janet Lowry.

“As you well know, Randolph-
Macon and W&L are socially
active. But I’m sure that with
other girls around, that might
change,”’ said Bill Driskill,
Associate Director of Admis-
sions at Randolph-Macon
Woman’s College.

None of the schools believe
coeducation at W&L would lead
to coeducation at their schools.

“The applicant who looks at
Mary Baldwin definitely looks
at it because it is all-women. If
W&L were to go coed, I don’t
think it would force us to go
coed,’’ Milker said.

Driskill agreed. ‘‘I doubt we
would have to consider going
- coed. We are a traditional
school, just as W&L is. But we
are deeply committed to the
principles and ideals behind
women’s education,”’ he said.

That same committment to
principles and ideals in
women’s education also holds
true for Hollins College.

“Let me make one thing
clear! (W&L’s going coed)
would not force Hollins to go
coed. We would hope that what-

ever the outcome, there would
still be a close relationship bet-
ween the schools,”’ said Sandra
Loveinguth, Director of Admis-
sions for Hollins.

Loveinguth wondered what
type of woman would attend
W&L.

“‘Would the type of woman at-
tracted to W&L be the type of
woman W&L men would want to
date?’’ she asked. ‘‘What type
of woman would be attracted to
W&L?”

The question of traditional,
all-male education means much
more to neighboring women’s
colleges than most would
believe.

“We use W&L, Hampden-
Sydney and VMI as selling
points in the admission process,
and with W&L coed, that would
change, drastically,’ said
Driskill.

“There’s just a_ historical
tradition to your institution, an
all-male tradition. I don’t think
Hollins is threatened by coedu-
cation, but concerned we are.
We would think thoughtful
men’s colleges should exist to
complement women’s colleges.
The role of the all-male college
is as distinctive a role as ours
is,’’ said Loveinguth. “It takes
judicious planning.”

The academic effect on other
schools is of great concern to
the neighboring schools. While
fewer high school graduates are
attending college, many more
women are opting for higher
education. Competition for top
students will heat up, admis-
sions counselors at the
neighboring women’s colleges
predict.

“‘W&L would skim the cream !

off our applicant pool, and I fear
the academic students might be
lost,”’ said Loveinguth, citing
past gains in average SAT
scores as typical of Hollins’
growth in the academic realm.

‘While it is conceivable that
applications might drop off, I
doubt that it would. Enrollment
is at its second highest in the
history of Sweet Briar. In that
sense, it might not necessarily
affect us,” Lowrey said.

Each of the women’s colleges,
however, admits the real effect
of W&L’s going coed is pure
speculation.

“It is hard to anticipate ex-
actly what the effect would be.
However, we need to remember
that the strength of each of the
schools in the area is derived
from the strengths of all of the
schools, and Washington and
Lee’s going coed would mean
some strength would be lost,’’
Loveinguth said.

According to VMI officials, there will be no women in the ranks in the near future.

 

Hampden-Sydney, VMI look on

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

Although neither Virginia .

Military Institute nor Hamp-
den-Sydney College currently
has any plans to abandon its all-
male status, officials at
Hampden-Sydney said that they
are keeping track of the coedu-
cation issue.

“‘We’re monitoring the situa-
tion, but at this moment we
don’t have any high-level com-
mittee studying it,’’ Lewis
Drew, the dean of students at
Hampden-Sydney, said.

Drew said that about 18
months ago a study group had
recommended that Hampden-
Sydney remain all-male for the
foreseeable future. The pro-
hibitive cost of going coed was
the main reason for the deci-
sion, Drew said.

Hampden-Sydney officals
also realize that demographic
trends show that there will be a
sharp drop in the number of

    
 
 
   
  

persons of college age in the
next decade, Drew said. The
college is trying to broaden its
recruiting base in order to
make up for this, he said.

Roughly 52 percent of. this
year’s freshman class at
Hampden-Sydney are Virginia
residents, Drew said. A large
percentage of: the non-Virgin-
ians come from states that
border Virginia, Drew added.

“We've set records for ap-
plications in the last two years.
But the worst years are yet to
come,” Drew said.

W. Sydnor Settle, the chair-
man of the Board of Trustees of
Hampden-Sydney, said that the
Board has supported attempts
to broaden the college’s re-
cruiting area.

“For whatever reason, the
college has a tradition of draw-
ing most of its students from
Virginia and bordering states,”
Settle said.

Both Drew and Settle said
that Hampden-Sydney’s admin-

“T really think that you might

of the coed question.

“I think we would probably
have to look at the issue again,”

‘Settle said concerning Hamp-

den-Sydney’s reaction to a
possible decision by Washing-
ton and Lee to go coed.

“As the number of all-male
colleges gets smaller, it might
seem more unique. It might
seem somewhat unusual,”’ Set-
tle said.

Drew said that if W&L went
coed, Hampden-Sydney would
have to ‘‘consider more closely
the coed issue.”” The necwork of
single-sex colleges in Virginia
provides a comfortable social
atmosphere that might be hurt
by a decision by W&L to go
coed, Drew said.

Alumni express divided opinions

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

Recent telephone interviews
with a handful of prominent
Washington and Lee alumni
show that opinion is divided on
the coeducation question, with
few willing to lend whole-
hearted support to either posi-
tion in the debate.

Although most had a strong
idea of their general sentiments
about such a change, a hesitant
sense of doubt pervaded the
- responses. Peter A. Agelasto III
(62), president of the 17-
member Alumni Board of Di-
rectors, said ‘“‘it’s a little pre-
mature” to have an opinion on
the question. ‘I speak for the
alumni. I need to be as aloof as I
possibly can so that I can make
a responsible evaluation,’”’ he
said.

The Norfolk lawyer con-
tinued, “I think what’s being
done from the University’s
standpoint is to educate every-
body. This is a very important

question for the alumni, the —

students and the University.”

“This is definitely not an
adversary proceeding,’’ he
said. ‘‘We’re all on the same
side of the fence. It’s just that
we represent different consti-
tuencies.”’

Agelasto said he believes he
can accurately speak for the
University’s alumni when he
submits his written recommen-
dation on the coeducation ques-
tion later this year. ‘I think the
Alumni Board is a big, diverse
group, and I think it will be
representative. A day doesn’t
go by that we don’t get input
from somebody.”’

He emphasized, however that
he ‘‘wouldn’t recommend for a
minute that we send out a post-
card asking for everybody’s
opinion.”’ ;

“T think it’s a question of
education,’’ he said. ‘‘It’s awful-
ly hard to keep the emotional-
ism out of the argument. You
get that on both sides. It’s not

black and white. It’s very
gray.”
He concluded by adminishing

the reporter, ‘I don’t think
anybody you contact ought to
give you a response with enough
meat to digest.”

William C. Norman Jr. (’56),
vice-president of the Alumni
Board, said, ‘‘I would anticipate
that any decision by the Board
of Trustees or the administra-
tion would be made in the in-
terest of what is going to be
needed to ensure the survival of
W&L into the next century.

“That’s a pretty heavy re-
sponsibility. I would not pre-
judge any decision that would
be made.”

However, he said, ‘‘If there’s
any possible way that the school
could survive as an all-male in-

West Virginia, Army and the
University of Virginia.

“There was all this hue and
cry from the students and the
alumni. We felt we’d been be-
trayed. But it was absolutely
the right decision,’’ he said.

According to Norman, ‘‘Ma-
jor changes are in the short run
disruptive. Unfortunately,
there is only one generation
that’s going to suffer the conse-
quences of this, and that’s
yours.

“It’s easy for me to take a
liberal viewpoint — and I’m not

I have no problem with being one

of five schools in our position.”

 

stitution, I’d be the first to say

that it was folly to try to change
that.’
The Crossett, Ark., bank

president said that an Alumni
Leadership Conference held in
Lexington last month was ‘‘the

first indication we had that the -

current administration might
be moving very rapidly toward
a resolution of this problem.”’

Norman said he was meeting
with a group of Arkansas alum-
ni over the weekend, and said
that ‘‘it’ll come as a big shock to
many of the alumni, I’m sure.”’

At the Alumni Leadership
Conference, the administration
gave a presentation which some
interpreted as being pro-coedu-
cation.

“T think it is possible that we
were not given and have not
been presented a totally balanc-
ed view if there is an opposing
constituency,’’ Norman
ackowledged.

Norman said his main con-
cern is that ‘‘I want that school
to survive. I think the debate
that is going on is healthy. All
opposing sides should be allow-
ed to present their point of
view.”

He pointed out that change
has racked the institution
before. As an example, he cited
the dropping of subsidized ath-
letics when he was a student.

At the time, W&L was playing
football with such schools as

saying I favor that.

“It would disrupt a pattern of
life and living that you folks
have out there now. That would
be extremely unfortunate. I’m
wrestling with that.”’

William E. Latture (’49),
treasurer of the Alumni Board,
had originally agreed to ex-
press his views on coeducation
for publication.

When he was contacted again,
however, he said, “Since we
talked last, I’ve received a com-
munication’’ asking him not to
speak with The Ring-tum Phi.
He said he would ‘‘prefer not to
say’’ who had made the request.

“‘We are in the process of for-
mulating our opinions,”’ he said.
“T don’t feel free to discuss it.
We will be submitting a report
by December. We feel this is
what’s in the best interest of the
University.”

James M. Slay Jr. (’65, ’71L),
chairman of the Alumni Admis-
sions Program for the ‘Del-
marva”’ (Delaware, Maryland,
Virginia) region, said, ‘I’m not
sure there’s any way for the
trustees to know (the effects of
coeducation) short of trying it.

“If they do that, and they’re
wrong, then it’s going to be too
late. They’re going to make sort
of a god-like decision.”’

“T’m not convinced that
there’s not a market for an all-

men’s school,” he said. “It -

frankly strikes me as being
change for change’s sake.”’
Slay, who concentrates his
recruiting efforts in the Eastern
Shore area, brought seven
freshmen to the class of 1987.
“‘We have never had any pro-

blem with boys being turned off
by the single sex. They’re much
more likely to be turned off by
geography or the expense.

“In fact, many of them like
the idea of not having women
around during the week and
then having big party week-
ends. That’s the same attitude I
had when I went up there from
Richmond.”

“We are unique,”’ he said. ‘‘I
have no problem with being one
of five schools in our position.

“When I go out and sell the
school, I’m selling a spirit, and
a lot of that is the spirit that I
experienced when I went there.

“Maybe we’ll lose that with
coeducation. Perhaps coeduca-
tion will improve it. I don’t
know.”

Slay praised the Admissions
Office for the assistance it gives
him, and says his W&L ex-
perience has been invaluable to
him. ‘‘The whole school is like a
big fraternity after you gradu-
ate,” he said.

The contacts are so helpful,
he said, that in legal circles,
people talk of ‘the W&L
Mafia.”

This could be lost-with coedu-
cation, according to Slay.
“Under the guise of academic

coeducation.

“The Admissions Office can
quantify demographic trends.
The people who are in favor of
coeducation have lots of dry,
empirical data.

“The way they respond, the
undergraduates trivialize their

position. An observer sees it as
cold, hard facts versus buf-
foonery.

“There’re a lot of good, sound
arguments that could be mus-
tered in opposition to coeduca-
tion. A rational defense is possi-

ble. But they’re probably
outgunned in the assembly of
data and cogent arguments.”’
Slay was also extremely
displeased by what he saw at
the fraternity houses he visited.

“They were given enough rope
to hang themselves with, and
they did,’’ he stated.

With these actions, Slay said,
“The people in the fraternities
may have just played into the
hands of those on the faculty
who want to close them down.”’

I. Langston Donkle III (’74),
Alumni Admissions Program
chairman for the South Caro-
lina/Piedmont region, said he
“would generally be opposed
to’’ coeducation at W&L.

 

“I think it’s a question of education.

It’s awfully hard to keep

the emotionalism out of the argument.

You get that on both sides.”

 

excellence, We could be losing
something even more valua-
ble,” Slay stated.

One proposal involves _in-
creasing the size of the school if
women are added. ‘‘I’d certain-
ly be opposed to raising the size
of the school, whether it’s coed
or single sex,”’ Slay said.

At the Alumni Conference,
Slay said, W&L President John
D. Wilson ‘‘was careful not to
state his views to us. I don’t

doubt him, and he says he
hasn’t made up his mind yet.”’
Slay was critical of the me-
thods he saw used by under-
graduate students opposed to

‘1 saw them try it at schools
like Davidson, Sewanee, Dart-
mouth and Virginia, and it
didn’t seem to work out at all as
they planned,”’ he observed.

Donkle said that the respon-
sibility for dealing with the
shrinking applicant pool lies
with the Admissions Office.

“If they’ll get out and do their
work and meet with the pro-
spective students, they can
overcome their apprehension
and misunderstanding’ about
the single-sex environment.
“It’s something we can easily
work with,’’ he said.

“They need to recruit more
intensely if we’re going to get
the quality of students we’re ac-
customed to. We need intelli-
gent, personable and im-
pressive people in admissions.

“IT need more help. I frankly
don’t get the help that I need
from admissions...I can tell the
difference.”’

Donkle said he thinks Direc-
tor of Admissions William M.
Hartog ‘‘might be a little more
cut and dried about admissions
— a little less personable’’ than
the previous director.

“IT see no reason for’’
coeducation, he concluded.

Wilson:

Copyright 1983,
The Ring-tum Phi

The Ring-tum Phi- You've
been president of Washington
and Lee since January, what
are your feelings about the
university in general?
President John Wilson- Well, I
have a very positive feeling
about Washington and Lee. I
think it was, from my point of
view, a very happy day when I
was elected in August...

I am immensely impressed
with the quality of the people
here. The faculty are superb
people to be with. The staff I
have inherited I think is full of
lovely, decent people. They are
also great characters and good
human beings. I think that’s
true of the students too...I think
the civility and the decency of
our students is impressive. So I
am enjoying it a lot, frankly. I
am stimulated by it every day.
Phi- During your interviews
with the Board, presumably the
question of coeducation was
raised. What was your initial
reaction when the Board of
Trustees asked you about coed-
ucation?

Wilson- Well, I was asked
about my attitudes in general,
not in the particular context of
Washington and Lee. I had to
say this, that I was a student in
a coeducational undergraduate
institution, large and public.
Then I was a student in an all-

male institution — essentially
private — though Oxford Uni-
versity is a very mixed institu-
tion in the terms of its support
but it was fundamentally a
small, private, superior-quality
kind of place, all-male. Then I
turned out later to be president
of a college for women-single-
sex (Wells College) and I de-
fended the single-sex institution
as vigorously as I could from
the perspective of the female as
opposed to a male institution.
And then I — of course — went
from there as you know to a
large public setting (Virginia
Tech) again where I was chiefly
taken up with the academic pro-
gram and relationships with
faculty...So it wasn’t an issue at
VPI though it had been in the
60s. VPI was also all male until
1963. So I knew a lot about what
they had gone through.

Back in the period at Wells, I
read every report that was ever
published on coeducation by the
major private institutions that
were then thinking about it. It
was necessary for me as a pres-
ident of a single-sex college to
become very much acquainted
with the literature and I
published a few articles on the
question of single-sex (educa-
tion). I thought frankly in 1982
when I came to Washington and
Lee that the question was rela-
tively moot. I didn’t think it was
a burning question. After all

 

“I thought frankly in 1982 when I

came to Washington and Lee that

the question was relatively moot.”

these decisions were made 10 or
12 years ago in most institu-
tions. The decision was made at
Washington and Lee in 1972 or
so to permit women to the law
school and they were happily
accomodated there... ©

When I had my first press
conference I wasn’t five min-
utes into the press conference
before that question was asked.
I said to the Board and I said at
the press conference that I
thought that...the success of an
institution was certainly to be
taken into account as well as
how well it had succeeded over
the years. How many genera-
tions of young people had it
prepared to go out into the
world they inherited and to suc-
ceed in that world? That if there
were to be a shift, to play with
the characteristics of an institu-
tion, the proof surely would rest
upon those who advocated a
significant shift. I still believe
that’s true... There were many
more concerns expressed by
faculty and by some students
about the total quality of life at
Washington and Lee... Now I
could have stopped them. I
could have said, ‘Look, that
issue has been settled. I don’t
care to take it up.’ I was trying
to learn about the university so
I didn’t really cut them off... So
obviously I probably — as a new
person whose views weren’t
known, whose views were still
being formed in fact — I pro-
bably turned out to be more of a
catalyst than I realized to this
whole process of self-examina-
tion.

So I didn’t bring the issue of
coeducation to Washington and
Lee, the Western World has
brought it to all of us. When my
Oxford College, which was
established in 1314, decided that
it could no longer sensibly
restrict its enrollment to men
alone in 1975, I knew that
something very serious was
afoot...

I tried to say to Lem Tucker
(CBS News Reporter) the other
day when CBS was up here with
the red light on, Washington
and Lee isn’t Amherst, it isn’t
Princeton, it isn’t Yale, it isn’t
Davidson. It’s its own special
place. It has its own great
characters in its past and in its
present. It has quintessentially
Robert E. Lee and what he
stood for and the values that he
represents and continues to
represent here and one has to
make, if one can, a calculation
of how translatable those values
are into a_e different
undergraduate setting... The
question is, what is the female
presence at W&L? Is it good
that it should be strictly social,
strictly weekend and mid-week
social events where women are
present here, where the serious
work of the university, its col-
lege, is reserved for men? So
the people who advocate
coeducation here say it isn’t to

 

fool of young people
| who are we g to Wash-

 

Improved Intellectual

increase the presence of women
here, it is to change the nature

‘of the presence of women here

and therefore to change the en-
vironment in ways they think
will be constructive and helpful
for the young men as well as the
young women who are going to
be going out into a very dif-
ferent, changed world.

Phi- You have had a chance to
observe academic and social
life here at Washington and Lee
for a year now. Has your at-
titude toward coeducation
changed during that course of
time?

Wilson- Well, not my attitude
about how the matter should be
approached. I think it should be
approached in the most. ra-
tional, intelligent, thoughtful,
sober way it could possibly be
approached. And I feel a genu-
ine responsibility to ensure as
much as I can that that be done.
I cannot stop bumper stickers
or banners to be flown ... that’s
part of the fun and zest of an in-
teresting, important conversa-
tion.

But I do feel an obligation to
contrive as objective an assess-
ment as we can of what is to be
lost and what is to be gained,
what is at stake, what is at
risk...SO my own. attitudes
about it, I am going to reserve,
frankly... If I don’t come
through the next few months
with some of my attitudes
shaped, changed, altered,
modified in one way or another,
then I will have not been very
observant...

So I am still learning about
Washington and Lee. There are
some people who say ‘How dare
he, how dare he indeed, with on-
ly seven months, come in here

 

‘I didn’t bring the issue of (

and advocate Coeducation?’

that’s a simplistic way of look-
ing at it.

Phi- Whose decision was it to
raise the question of coeduca-
tion this seriously? Was it your
decision or the Board’s deci-
sion?

Wilson- Well, the Board at the

meeting - just concluded — as
you know — formally took steps

to ask that the matter be
seriously re-examined...

I said in the spring at the
Alumni Association meeting in
Lee Chapel “I do not believe
that a serious re-examination
can be avoided, much as you
would like to hear me say that it
can be avoided.”’ So it is cer-
tainly true to say that I have
recommended that this matter
be taken off the table and re-
examined...

We cannot go into this decade
blithely skipping through the
tulips, assuming that all is go-
ing to be well and that we’ll
have our 1,325 undergraduate
men. It’s just not going to hap-
pen unless we cause it to hap-
pen... If we decide to remain all
male at the undergraduate
level, then some very extraor-
dinary things are going to have
to happen in order to protect the
quality of this place and I don’t

ee

“We cannot go

—
know what all those are yet. So
it’s part of trying to take stock
and that’s what I am for. That’s
what any president must do. To
try to plan what needs to be
done in order to secure a
stronger, better Washington
and Lee. That’s the only thing
that is important here. Not me
or my feelings or you and your
feelings or the alumni’s feelings
about this. Those are all part of
a mosaic. But it’s all part of try-
ing to figure out what is in the
best interest of this University.

Phi- Eventually you will make
a recommendation about coedu-
cation to the Board. How big a
factor is tradition in that recom-
mendation?

Wilson- The point about tradi-
tion is I think it’s silly to say
that anything that was here 234
years ago must remain. Be-
cause then you would be
reading Livy, Suetonius,
Herotodotus and Thucydides
and you wouldn’t be remotely
connected up with the courses
and curriculum. But you have
to inquire beneath the label
“What is meant by Tradition?
What is exactly at stake here?
Now when people say ‘‘Well, the
Honor System.”’ That’s the first
thing that comes to mind of
those who invoke tradition...

programs change that?...

You start out with a defini-
tion of Washington and Lee as a
first-rate university; national in
scope, pretentions to the highest
quality, successful alums, etc.
That’s the definition of Wash-
ington and Lee. That’s the in-
stitution most of you applied to.
To what extent did you also app-
ly because it was all male?
Since coming — whether in
spite of that or because of it
—you have become fond of the
place, you see how it works, and
you like how it works, and that’s
associated with its gender. Can
you untangle that in some kind
of intellectual exercise to see
whether or not what matters
most would survive or whether
what matters most would in
some way be changed.

Phi- When you make your
recommendation regarding co-
education to the Board, whose
opinion — student or faculty or
alumni — will you consider the
most?

Wilson- When I make a recom-
mendation to the Board, I am
going to have to make it in a
way that I can live with. it.
That’s first and foremost...

I would have to say that the
faculty who are here now who
know the University well and
have committed their lives to
the University and who are re-
sponsible for its chief activity
and especially those who were
also students here...I am going
to pay special attention to the
law faculty who were here be-
fore and who took their under-
graduate degrees here and who
have seen coeducation in that
context. And I am going to pay

 

attention to key emeritus
trustees as well as the current
trustees and I am going to be
obviously interested in key
donors and alumni who have
been responsible and who love
the place, who have given
money to it. I am going to pay
attention to what they have to
say. And then I am going to try
to tap into responsible student
leaders... And then I am going
to trust my own judgments.

Phi- You say you are going to
consider key alumni. What goes
through your mind when you
get a letter from Supreme Court
Justice Lewis Powell?

Wilson- Well, I take Mr.
Powell very seriously. He is a
thoughtful man. He enclosed in
his letter — I don’t think it
would be wrong to say — a copy
of his dissent in the Mississippi
Women’s College case and
made a point about diversity in
American higher education and
his hope that it would remain a
diverse system. I replied to that
letter in some length and tried
to explain to him some of the
things that were being raised
here in the Washington and Lee
context. He has since replied to
me to say that he was grateful
for my thoughtful letter and
that I had raised some points
that he hadn’t considered and
that dialogue will continue.

Phi- When do you think that
this issue will be decided?
Wilson- May may be too early.
The Board may judge other-
wise. I have said to the Board
that I hope that we do not have
to carry this over into another
academic year. Let’s try to
work within that framework
and see how we come out. I hope
I am in a position to take a posi-
tion in May and don’t ask me be-
fore the Board meeting.

Phi- How far are you away
from making your decision?
Wilson- Well, I am still trying
to find out how students truly
think about it. We have got to
get beyond the bumper sticker.
And I have got to get with the
faculty and get their considered
views... 1 am half way there in
the sense that I believe the mat-
ter requires serious examina-
tion.

Phi- Are you an advocate of
coeducation?

Wilson- No, I am not going to
declare that. Iam going to be an
advocate for what I think is best
for Washington and Lee and the
Board is then going to have to
make a judgment about that
and they will then finally make
a decision based on what they
collectively think is best for
Washington and Lee. I am not
an ideologue when it comes to
coeducation, I didn’t come here
saying the first and foremost
thing we must do is change this
institution. I would not have
come here. Why would I have
come here? I was happy in my
work... I came to Washington
and Lee because it is a first-rate
institution and I wanted to be

associated and have something
to do with a first-rate institution
and to be president of a first-
rate institution with such
memorable people who have
been here before me. All of that
is immensely attractive and
satisfying. I didn’t come think-
ing it’s deeply flawed in its cen-
tral characteristic. I have bet-
ter things to do than take on
15,000 alumni and 1,325 under-
graduates and 350 law students

you don’t shrink from issues
that seem to be important to
people and that seem to mat-

I have no choice but to look at

body in my position would.

Phi- Is this just an academic
problem, or does it become an
economic problem?

Wilson- To be sure there are
financial implications to the
problem of contraction. If you
are going to reduce your fresh-
‘man class by 25 percent, and
then over four years reduce the
total undergraduate student
population by 25 percent, you
are compelled to do that in
order to keep some modicum of
standards. Then you are not
able to contract your faculty the
same way. Then you have a fi-
nancial problem to be sure; an
acute one, a serious one.

Phi- During your time here as
president you have raised such

controversial questions as
coeducation, fraternities and
housing. Do you feel that rais-
ing these questions has
alienated you from members of
the university community?
Wilson- I don’t in any way
shrink or apologize for raising
those questions. I think that’s
my job. I do have the human
weakness of not wanting to be
desperately dislikes, and that is
troublesome because I think in
some cases I am thought to be
meddling without license in
things I don’t understand —
either through ‘ignorance or in-
experience’ I believe is the
phrase — and that’s trouble-
some...I don’t go through life
saying that everything I do, say
or may be or stand for is going
to be universally applauded.
Especially in a position like this
where I happen to be the focal
point of a lot of interests, some
of them not entirely compati-
ble...No, I don’t like not to be
liked. I like to feel that what I
am doing is understood and gen-
erally approved of, but I fully
realize that I will not satisfy
everybody. I only hope one
thing and that is my motives
are not suspect, that I am not
thought to have some hidden
ideological agenda.

Other coed schools cite improvements
R-MC, Sewanee, Davidson compared to WGL

- By TODD SMITH
Staff Reporter

Comparisons between W&L
and three similar universities
— Randolph-Macon in Ashland,
The University of the South and
Davidson College — seem to in-
dicate that recent conversions
to coeducation have improved
the schools and that they have
not consequently suffered from
a fall of alumni support.

“As for overall impact, it’s .

probably the greatest thing
Randolph-Macon ever did,’’ Ad-
missions Director John Conk-
right of Randolph-Macon said.

The University of the South at
Sewanee, Tenn., “‘has been
nicer,” Dean of Men Doug
Seiters said. “It’s a more nor-
mal community with a better
social situation,”’ he said.

Davidson vs. W&L

The situation of Davidson Col-
lege, Davidson, N.C., is most
comparable to that of Washing-
ton and Lee, according to W&L
Dean of Students Lewis John
and Associate Dean of Admis-
sions at Davidson Gardner
Roller.

‘‘We were drawing from ex-
actly the same applicant pool,
we had the same quality stu-
dents,’’ Ms. Roller said. In 1971
the two schools accepted about
60 percent of applicants in order
to fill their freshman classes,

although Davidson had ac-
cepted a lower percentage
throughout the 1960s.

Since coeducation in 1972,
Davidson has surged ahead, ac-
cording to W&L admissions
figures. Davidson now accepts
35 percent of its applicants to
get enough to fill up its
freshman class; because only
41 percent of W&L’s accepted
students will matriculate, W&L
must accept 57 percent of its ap-
plicants. In other words, David-
son extends admission to fewer
applicants because it knows
three in five will accept; W&L
can only count on two in five
coming.

Another yardstick is SATs, in
which Davidson led W&L by
roughly 20 points in 1971;
Davison now leads by 100
points, according to W&L ad-
mission figures.

Ms. Roller believes that the
effect of coeducation ‘‘is entire-
ly positive. The applicant pool
has increased dramatically and
the quality has also improved,”
she said. ‘‘The change has been
more rapid in the last five or six
years as the concentration of
women has increased.”’

“The world has changed and
single-sex education is no
longer in vogue,” Ms. Roller
said. ‘‘As a result, students
have begun to seek out coed en-
vironments.”

“If W&L was to make the

 

“The world has changed

and single-sex education

is no longer in vogue.”

decision in favor of coeduca-
tion, we would be competing for
the same students in a very
short time,”’ she said.

Davidson’s trustees made the
decision to admit women as
degree candidates in May of
1972, after a poll showed that a
substantial majority of stu-
dents, faculty, staff and alumni
favored the move.

According to Dr. Julius
Melton of the Davidson develop-
ment office, alumni giving did
not drop off after coeducation.
In fact, the unrelated instiga-
tion of an annual giving cam-
paign drove alumni funding up.

Because alumni were in favor
of coeducation from the start,
and because there would be no
displacement of men by wom-
en, Melton found little alumni

resentment. He has never met -

an alumnus disgruntled over

"the issue, he said.
‘
As planned, the admission of

women would not have displac-
ed men because total enroll-
ment would have increased
from 1000 to 1500. In reality,
Melton said declining applicant
pools have kept enrollment at
around 1400 — 900 men, 500
women.

“I got here about the time
coeducation began,” Melton
said. ‘‘We have been consistent-
ly going up ever since.”

Sewanee’s intangibles

At Sewanee, Dean of Men and
alumnus Doug Seiters mea-
sures the impact of coeducation
in less quantitative ways, and
yet defends coeducation. “I
have always been a supporter of
the change. For our isolated
community it was necessary,”
Seiters said.

Coeducation “‘had a leveling
effect. When I was a student in
1965 there were three big
weekends when women were
here, and otherwise we just sat

around the fraternity house and
listened to the juke box, and
thought about how miserable
we were,”’ he said.

“We liked to think, as you
may, that being different was
part of the distinctive charm of
the school. But the social life is
much healthier and less abnor-
mal now.

“There was something in-
tangible that was lost...There
was a kind of closeness among
students and faculty that’s not
the same today.

“A lot of it (the closeness)
was out of necessity, too. You
just didn’t go out on a date, so
you socialized with your pro-
fessors more,’’ he said.

Sewanee’s applicant pool had
shrunk so greatly during the
1960s that in 1968 over 90 per-
cent of the applicants -were of-
fered admission. Since coeduca-
tion in September of 1969, the
number of applications has
shown an overall increase.

“It seemed to me that it was a
total breath of fresh air,” said
Oliver Marcus, director of an-
nual giving at Sewanee. ‘‘The
girls hit the ground running.
Within a year or two the
valedictorian was a girl...It was
a civilizing influence of a

~ serious magnitude.”

Marcus found annual giving
to increase between 1968 and
1969, despite any chilling effect
of coeducation on alumni.
‘There was no serious reaction
that could be measured in gifts
atall.”

“‘T think there was a residual :

regret that the world was mov-
ing on and that it was necessary
to change in order to maintain
quality,’”’ Marcus said. But ‘99
percent of the alumni under-
stood and approved,”’ excluding
the “crabby individuals who
say, ‘I hate change even if it’s
for the better.’ ”

Randolph-Macon, Ashland

John Conkright, Director of
Admissions at Randolph-
Macon, finds a similar re-
sponse. ‘I am sure the majority
of alumni are realistic and saw
it (coeducation) was an ex-
cellent decision.”

Like Sewanee, Randolph-
Macon’s declining pull on ap-
plicants suggested financial
danger. The trustees voted in
January 1971 to plunge into
coeducation the following
September.

“The transition was not
traumatic at all. Now the
women contribute to the life of
the college in every way,”
Conkright said. Most of the
students who earn academic
scholarships are women, he
noted.

Conkright in turn asked about
coeducation as an issue at W&L.
News that a change may be in
the offing has obviously moved
through the network of
Southern college administra-
tions, especially through admis-
sions and development offices.

“‘T think the fact that it comes
up over and over again (at

W&L) means it won’t go away,”
Conkright said.

Former CIA agent will speak

John Stockwell, a former
agent of the Central In-
telligence Agency who has writ-
ten a controversial analysis of
covert action in the Angola civil
war, will present a lecture en-
titled ‘‘The Secret Wars of the
CIA” today at 8 p.m. in Lee
Chapel. The public is invited.
Admission is free.

The program is part of Con-
tact ’83, a speaker symposium
sponsored by the interfraternity
council and the student body.

A former case officer in
Africa and Vietnam, Stockwell
served in the CIA from 1964 to
1977 when he quit the agency in

anger over what he considered
the ‘‘dirty tricks’ engaged in by
the Agency.

“In Search of Enemies’’ is
Stockwell’s 1978 book in which
he argues that the CIA ought to

 

be dismantled ‘‘for the good of
the United States and the
world.” He was sued by the CIA
as a result of his book.

He has —_* on CEe-TY s

Stockwell has charged that
the “‘CIA poses the ultimate
threat to democracy and is a

major cause of the world’s
move toward nuclear extinc-
tion.”’

A native of Texas, Stockwell
was raised in the Belgian Congo
where his father was an
engineer. He graduated from
the University of Texas and
served three years on active du-
ty in the Marine Corps and 19
years in the Marine Corps
Reserve.

During his 13 years as a CIA
field case officer, he was chief
of station in Africa, spent two
years in Vietnam, and was a

Lexington man

NOV1 11963

indicted for rape

G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

A Lexington man has been in-
dicted on one count of rape and
one count of statutory burglary
in connection with the Sept. 15
incident involving a Randolph-
Macon Woman’s College stu-
dent at the Pi Kappa Alpha
fraternity house, 106 N. Main St.

The indictment against
Daniel Robert Tinsley, 20, of 224
Maury St., was handed down
Monday by a Rockbridge Coun-
ty grand jury.

If convicted, Tinsley could
face from five years to life in
prison on the rape count and up

.to 20 years on the statutory

burglary count, according to
Lexington Police Chief L.O. Sut-
ton.

Tinsley was indicted on the
statutory burglary count, Sut-
ton said, because allegedly he
entered the house with the in-
tent to commit a larceny or
rape and that this intent ‘‘was
verified by the act itself.’’

Although Sutton said he could
not give the specifics on how the
evidence was gathered because
“that gets into evidence that
should be presented before the
court,” he did say, “‘it was
gathered, for the greater part,
through forensic science.”

Sutton called forensic science
“a tremendous investigating
tool.”’

“Tll use any investigative
tool at my disposal,”’ he added.

Sutton said evidence gathered
from the scene of the crime was
taken to the forensics labor-
atory in Roanoke for analysis.

The student was sleeping in a
bedroom on the second floor of
the Washington and Lee Univer-
sity fraternity house when she
was assaulted about 3:45 in the
morning, police said at the
time.

A fraternity member in
another room was awakened by
her struggling and removed the
assailant from the house.

Tinsley is being held in
Rockbridge County jail. No trial
date has been set.

 

 

WGL Parents’ Weekend
focuses on student life

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity will observe its 29th annual
Parents’ Weekend Friday,
Saturday and Sunday.

Designed to encourage
among the parents of W&L
students a greater understand-
ing of the university, the
weekend will feature numerous
activities to acquaint the
parents with various aspects of
student life at W&L.

The weekend will begin with a
series of open houses in univer-
sity departments and will also
include a Friday evening con-
cert by three of the university’s
musical organizations and the
annual President’s Reception.

In addition to more open
houses on Saturday, parents
will be invited to participate in

 

Calendar on page 11

 

seminars with members of the
university’s faculty and admin-
istration and student leaders.

Washington and Lee Presi-
dent John D. Wilson will deliver
his annual Report to Parents in
Lee Chapel on Saturday morn-
ing at 11:30 a.m.

The Washington and Lee foot-
ball team will conclude its
season by playing Lebanon
Valley on Wilson Field on Satur-
day afternoon, and the Univer-
sity Theatre will present
‘“‘Rashomon’”’ on Saturday eve-
ning.

Throughout the weekend, the
parents are also encouraged to
meet individually with faculty
members.

Review and Outlook [Js a/J-male only attraction ?

A clouded window

In our editorial last week, we advocated open
discussion between students and the administration
concerning major university decisions.

At the heart of this idea is the need for the ad-
ministration to inform the students when such deci-
sions are being contemplated. The most recent pro-
blem in this respect is the proposed shortening of the
February Washington break.

The Faculty Executive Committee drew up the plan
about a month ago but put off its vote. Last Thursday,
the student members of the University Council voted
the proposal down 7-1. Monday the faculty as a whole
also voted the proposal down.

Although we are happy that the plan did not pass,
we feel that the outcome was not as important as the
manner in which it was decided.

The only opportunity for student opinion in this
decision was at the University Council meeting. Un-
fortunately, there was no notice that this question
would be taken up. Of course there were notices that
the Council would meet but it is unrealistic and im-
practical to think that students will go to every
meeting to see whether or not an important issue is
being discussed.

This lack of communication is dangerous and unfor-
tunately not without precedent.

The new curriculum requirements were passed
with a minimum of student input as were the changes
to the grade-point system. Student opinion is essential
to a fair discussion of these matters but for there to be
student opinion, students must first be informed

This is especially important in light of two decisions
facing the University as a whole: the need for a
Spring term and the more basic decision about
whether to remain all-male at the undergraduate
level.

Decisions made behind the student body’s back only
serve to create distrust toward the administration
despite its intentions. The window between the
students and the administration need not be clouded.

To the Editors:

Among any number of in-
cisive points in his column last
week, Stephen Matrazzo noted
an argument which deserves
some further consideration: ‘‘If
single-sex education is all that
makes this university unique,
what good is the university?”’

This is an essential question. Is
being all-male so important
that W&L’s quality . depends
upon it?

We have to begin by demon-
strating that W&L is a good
university. I will define a “good
university’’ as a place where an
education of excellent quality

Student cites Fiji merits

Recently, the Student Ac-

to kick the fraternity of Phi

decision came after two in-
cidents this year involving the

In reference to ‘Faculty

removal of the Hampton and
Sydney mascot’s tail by pledges
during the recent game held
there. However, upon closer in-
spection of the circumstances
surrounding these incidents and
the rulings concerning similar
actions by other fraternity
houses on campus, it does not
appear that such a_ stern

measure was required.
I am a junior here at W&L,

and have just had the opportuni-
ty to witness the drastic im-
provements which Fiji has
undergone during these past
three years, changing from a
house with a flooded basement
and an exterior to match, to one
of the best maintained houses
on campus. They have gone
from a state of near bankruptcy
to one which is today financially

may be obtained. It is still dif-
ficult to determine whether
W&L is a good school since I
have no comparative ex-
perience at another school. But
over three years’ experience
here has led me to believe that
an excellent education may be
found here. The principal
reason for this, I feel, is not our
single-sex status, but, instead,
our size. Instruction here is
generally on a very personal
level. Many of the things we
take for granted are not avail-
able in larger universities. At
the University of Illinois, one of
the nation’s finest schools,
Chemistry 101 meets with 300 or
so students at 9 a.m. The lecture
is recorded and played back for
each hourly section during the
day. Here, we get back papers
graded by the professor, who
knows our names, who probably
notices if we blow off class, who
has office hours primarily to
speak with students. We don’t
even need an appointment’ to
speak to a dean. These instruc-
tors are, with few exceptions,
wise and learned men who have
chosen to teach first and to
research and write as a secon-
dary pursuit. They offer us an
excellent education if we want
it.

But do we? Are we interested

(continued on page 9)

Matrazzo overlooked free choice

To the Editors:

Stephen J. Matrazzo’s column
in the Nov. 3 edition of The
Ring-tum Phi, presented one of
the most twisted and distorted
arguments concerning coeduca-
tion put forth to date. One need
not favor or oppose coeducation
to see the holes in his swiss
cheese argument. Matrazzo
comes to the conclusion that
Washington and Lee should
become coed in an effort to
broaden its horizons. He says
that the university is, ‘“‘geared
to a certain constituency...
uniform in background, politi-
cal beliefs, ethnic origin, taste
etc.” In a word, he calls the
university, ‘‘one dimensional.”

Mr. Matrazzo dismisses free
choice as a reason for W&L re-
maining single-sex by saying,
“if you want freedom of choice,
you’re free to go to Hampden-
Sydney, etc.”’ Well Mr. Matraz-
zo, if you want diversity, and
think you can find it, you are
free to go to UVa, Virginia
Tech, UNC, The University of
Florida, etc., etc. No one is forc-
ed to go to Washington and
Lee, Furthermore, if Hampden-
Sydney and other all-male col-
leges and universities accepted
your attitude of passing the
buck the choice of attending an
all-male school would no longer
be available. Mr. Matrazzo says
that we heard all the standard
arguments for and against
coeducation and, ‘‘everyone has
missed the point.’’ Unfortunate-

 

 

ly, he did not have a chance to

read the Phi’s in-depth 10-page
supplementary analysis of
coeducation that covers nearly
every aspect of the issue. Clear-
ly, Mr. Matrazzo has missed the
point.

Stephen Matrazzo refutes the
more common arguments for
and against coeducation by say-
ing that they are based on “‘in-
justice” and “‘tradition,” and
that these are “meaningless
subjective terms.” People feel
very strongly about traditions
and are often willing to fight for
them. As far as injustice is con-
cerned, perhaps Mr. Matrazzo
should consult a dictionary or a
thesaurus where he would find
that an injustice is a wrong.
Matrazzo claims that one
dimensionality pervades at all
levels and leads to conformity
both in and out of the class-
room. Furthermore, he argues
that one should “try really
disagreeing with a professor.”
Obviously, he thinks this cannot
or is not done. Perhaps Mr.
Matrazzo is afraid to oppose his
teachers, or perhaps he has
argued with them and used the
same type of faulty reasoning
he used in his commentary. In
either case, one can see why he
may find it impossible to “‘real-
ly” disagree with a professor.

Stephen Matrazzo argues in
favor of making W&L coed as a
step in the right direction
toward diversification. How-
ever, there is no guarantee, ex-
cept for the inclusion of women,
that coeducation would make

our university more diverse.
There is nothing to ensure that
the women would be from dif-
ferent political or ethnic
backgrounds than the men who
already attend. What we might
very well see, is men and
women of the same “dimen-
sion.” '

Mr. Matrazzo concluded his
article by saying “if coeduca-
tion passes in May, will those
declaring ‘better dead than
coed’ bless us with voluntary
euthanasia?” They may, but it
seems Stephen J. Matrazzo has
beaten them to the punch with
his commentary and committed
voluntary intellectual
euthanasia.

Grenadian policy dangerous, Handelman charges

‘We are fair game for everyone’

By NELSON PATTERSON
Staff Reporter

The American “invasion” of
Grenada was “‘a convenient op-
portunity for the military to flex
its muscles in a sure-win situa-
tion’’ and sets a dangerous
precedent for foreign policy
based on ‘‘potential’’ threats,
according to politics Professor
John Handelman.

“Is it a legitimate foreign
policy goal, to make the world
safe for democracy versus be-
ing safe for tourists? It seemed
our justification for the entire
operation was that 10,000 foot
runway and the potential for a
Cuban base there. Such a policy
of potential harm is danger-
ous,’’ Handelman noted. ‘Do
we not place ourselves as a
target since we have the poten-
tial to do harm to everyone? We
are fair game for everyone.”

In objecting to the policy of
potential for harm as a basis for
a policy judgment, Handelman
also sees other problems with
the Grenadian invasion. The
damage done to the United
States’ reputation as
democratic and freedom loving
is irreparable.

“I think we have to look at the
cost-benefit of the move. Ana-
lyze the cost to our international
reputation. For whatever gains
we made. The Security Council.
Everyone’ voted against the
United States except Great Bri-
tain, who abstained. We, of
course vetoed the resolution.
One has to worry about cost in-
curred. It is not equitable to the
benefit,’’ he said.

Supporters of the show of
military prowess note that
Grenada now has (or will have)
a stable, democratic govern-
ment. Such words are fodder to
Handelman’s argument.

“Promoting stability? That’s
a can of worms! Should stabili-
ty be a goal? I don’t know
whether stability is enough to
offset the costs. By promoting
stability in such a move, we are
denying the reality of change in
the world. If stability is our
goal, what about self-determin-
ation?’’ questioned Handelman.

The seemingly overwhelming
approval by the American
public and the Grenadian
population to the move also fell
prey to Handelman’s_skep-
ticism. Many backers of the
move note the willingness of the
native army to lay down its
guns and not fight the Marines
as evidence of an unpopular
government being forced upon
a people.

“Tl would lay down my arms
also in the face of the (US.)
Marines,”’ he said.

“What really bugs me,’’ he
continued, ‘‘is the censoring go-
ing on in reporting the invasion.
If it warranted being reportcd
that there were a number of
Grenadians who wanted — even
were thankful — for the inva-
sion then surely it warranted
being reported that there were

a number of Grenadians who
preferred us not to be there.”’
Similarly, Handelman is
angered by the Pentagon at-
titude that a ‘“‘minimum’’ of
lives were lost in the operation.

“IT have a student who said in
class, ‘Well, Marines are expen-
dable.’ Frankly, I don’t accept
that. Even if you lose one
soldier, it is unacceptable. I
realize you won’t hear that idea
from the President, with all his
emotional trauma,’’ Handel-
man noted.

“I don’t like the undercurrent
of indifference in the Grenada
policy, that makes it easy to be
heroic at a distance — to be an
armchair quarterback, but if
your son or daughter is there,
well that’s a different story. It
should have been addressed
earlier,”’ said Handelman.

Another fault Handelman
finds with the Grenadian inva-
sion is the implications it brings
about proceduralism and inter-
national law. The United States,
Handelman notes, was the
enraged party at the Interna-
tional Court of Justice when
Iran ‘‘thumbed its nose’’ at the
law in holding United States’
diplomats hostage. Now, the
United States is thumbing its
nose at International law, the
Rio Treaty (of the Organization
of American States) and the
United Nations’ Charter.

‘“‘We need to ask ourselves yet
another question. What are our
legitimate concerns? , this being
a threat at our ‘backdoor.’ As
though geographically it war-
rants our immediate attention.
We have 40,000 troops in South
Korea. We have troops all over.
What are the limits of our
American interests? Just

because they’re close geo-
graphically? What were they
doing to really threaten us?’’ he
asked.

“We find equipment for 4,000
troops, a rifle and a sidearm for
each. Does that really threaten
us? Are we afraid they’!] splash
up on Boca Raton and make
their way to Atlanta? Is that
really a threat? I’m worried,
real worried, if we perceive that
as a threat,’ said Handelman.

While he is eager to chew
apart the policy, he is slow to
provide substantive alternative
policies.

‘(Grenada’s neighbors) have
reason to be concerned, but at
the same time, I’m not entirely
sure that they should not have
done more themselves. They
could have asked us for arms.
We'll gleefully supply arms.
We'll gleefully supply advisers
to show them how to use the

arms. We could even have tried
a blockade,’ he noted.

“But that brings us all back to
potential. Was there really a
danger to the medical students?
or just a potential danger? I’m
not convinced the danger was
enough. You’ve got to go on
evidence. You can’t go on poten-
tial. We’re still issuing visas for
people to go to the Philippines.
Even the President won’t go
there,”’ he said.

“There is just greater poten-
tial in this for us to come out
smelling like a turd. There is no
potential for benefits. The costs
are real. The big risk is the in-
terim p.r. Who are we trying to
convince, ourselves’ or
others?,”’ he asked, going on to
answer his own question. ‘“‘We
do a good job of convincing our-
selves with the help of the
media, but we sure do a poor job
convincing others.”’

Questions arise about commentary

~ by SCOTT MASON
Coeducation has aroused
more debate on the Washington
and Lee campus than perhaps
any other issue in the last
decade. A lot of students feel

Reader’s
Advocate

 

 

strongly about the matter.
That’s evident from the number
of letters that have poured in to
The Ring-tum Phi. Students
have found an outlet where they
can vent their opinions. They
have something to say about
coeducation and aren’t afraid to
Say it.

Faculty opinion, on the other

hand, has been almost non-
existent. Students don’t really
know what professors think
about coeducation.

Last week an article under
the heading, “Dismissing the
Obvious Piffle’’ appeared on the
oninion page of the Phi. It was
written by a faculty member at
the request of Phi Chief Editors
Rick Swagier and John
Cleghorn. The professor didn’t
sign his name to the article,
because he was ‘concerned
about repercussions from the
administration,’ according to
Swagler.

Its been a long-standing pol-
icy of the Phi not to print let-
ters that aren’t signed, An
anonymous letter is_ risky
because there is no way of
checking whether it is true,
Swagler said. It could be
libelous. If it is, the Phi is
responsible.

The faculty member’s com-
mentary last week wasn’t sign-
ed. Why did the Phi decide to
print the unsigned article when
it refuses to print anonymous
letters?

In this instance Swagler and
Cleghorn asked the faculty
member to write the commen-
tary. They knew who the author

was. There was little risk in
Sts the commentary with-
ut the author’s signature since

they knew who to check with if
questions arose about the arti-
cle.

The Phi has received at least
one written complaint and
numerous vocal complaints
arguing that the unsigned com-
mentary shouldn’t have been
printed. But in this instance, the
Phi’s decision to run the article
makes sense. After all, the
Phi’s policy not to print
anonymous letters is based only

on avoiding legal trouble. There
was no such risk of libel when
the Phi printed the unsigned
commentary.

vocate, operates on a separated
basis from the editorial board of

analyze the Phi's news coverage
and address any consequent ques-
tions.

“Wreck families, ruin homes
and scar bewildered children’

By MARKHAM SHAW PYLE

I remember the day I decided
to give it up. It was a rainy day.
Cold. Dreary. A good day for
goodbyes.

I'd told myself it was not
abuse. I could stop if I wanted
to. I didn’t do half as much as
some. Not like ... well, I knew
the names. I.couldn’t hold a
candle to the real addicts. I
could handle it.

But then it got out of hand, for
me and for others. I saw its
results. It branded one student,
and then another, and yet
another. And it wasn’t just

students. I saw it wreck
families, ruin homes, scar
bewildered children. Daddy,

what happened to Mama?

I saw that it inevitably got the
upper hand, took command.
And it devoured all good things,
light and love and laughter.

So I quit. I’m through with it.
The Church knew: it must be
given no quarter. It’s always
wrong, no matter what it pleads
in its defense. So I quit.

No more gossip. Not a drop.

I've been gossipped about in

my time; and to. And God
knows I had passed it on. I
verified my sources. I was
discriminate. I checked for ac-
curacy, for witnesses. I careful-
ly distinguished mere rumor
from real scandal. I was
reliable. I was the AP wire for
the campus. Others might
break a story faster or tell a
livelier tale; but if you wanted
the inside track on fact over fic-
tion, you probably ended up

My View

asking me. So I have had some
part in the wrecking. I hope the
greater part came from others.
But that excuses nothing.
Gossip is a genteel form of
murder, so common in the com-
fortable classes that its basic
viciousness is overlooked. But

 

 

- murder it remains. True or

false, impartial or malicious,
hateful or merely indiscreet,
rumor is a ravening beast. It

must not be tolerated for an ins-
tant.

They say Gossip is a. woman-
ish vice. I doubt it. This place is
a ‘dark satanic mill’ of scandal.
If this. is a feminine trait, here
at least no coeducation is need-
ed to give us insight into the
psyche of women.

I was not, I know, the only or
even the worst practitioner of
this ancient dark art. I can
think of perhaps three saintly
folk above the practice. All
sorts and conditions of men do
it. We have the ladies beat on
this. The wildest tales of the
gossip that goes on in Anglican
women’s groups, southern la-
dies’ sodalities and the Junior
League, even if true, would pale
in comparison with the amount
of scandal mongered on this
campus in a slow week. It
shouldn’t be that way. I for one
am through with it, by God’s
good grace.

Quaecunque honesta .. What-
soever things are pure, what-
soever ... honest, think on these
things. There is really no ex-
cuse not to. Ever.

Read is re-elected as Commonwealth’s Attorne
ie

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

Republican Beverly § C.
‘John’? Read defeated three
challengers Tuesday to win a
third term as Commonwealth’s
Attorney for Lexington and
Rockbridge County.

Read received 46 percent of
the votes cast in the election,
which drew a 73 percent turnout
in the city and 69 percent in the
county.

His nearest competitor,
Democrat Larry Mann, was 479
votes behind with 38 percent. In-
dependents Robert Joyce and
James Adams garnered 14 per-
cent and 2 percent of the total,
respectively.

In the wake of his victory,
Read promised citizens that he
would work ‘‘to preserve their
security, to keep their trust, and
to be fair and even-handed in all
matters involving our system of
justice.”

“‘T have tried to do a good job
as Commonwealth’s Attorney
over the last eight years,’’ Read
said. ‘‘I hope people have ap-
preciated the work that I have
done during that time and I will
try to do a good job for the next
four years.”

“I said during the entire cam-
paign that I would continue to
operate my office in the same
way in the next four years that I
have during this term,”’ he con-
tinued.

“My actions involving pro-
secution, plea bargaining and
requests for jail time — all of

these features icve been the
same during the last tour vears
that they were during my tirst
term, and the people will see
that they won't change in the
next four years, either.’’

Read says that during a cam-
paign, he works to avoid ‘‘any
type of mudslinging or negative
advertising about’’ his op-
ponents. ‘‘I have chosen a dif-
ferent style of campaigning,”’
he said. “I campaign only on
positive points.

“Tm not a politician. I don’t
know all the nuances of political
campaigning. I believe in pos-
itive campaigns — not to distort
anything or take it out of con-
text.”’

Read said he was ‘very
pleased’’ that he took the City of
Lexington and thanked the
Washington and Lee College
Republicans and some of the
faculty members for their
assistance.

The prosecutor said he ‘‘can’t
think of any’’ other office he’d
like to hold. ‘I enjoy being the
Commonwealth’s Attorney, and
I enjoy serving the community
in that capacity.”

Republican Vance Wilkins
was elected to a fifth term as
the 24th District representative
to the House of Delegates by a
surprisingly large margin.

He handily defeated Demo-
crat Nanalou Sauder, a
Rockbridge resident, 59 percent
to 41 percent. His margin last
year over Mrs. Sauder was 37
votes out of over 12,000 cast.

to win, but I was surprised at
the margin,”’ Wilkins said.
Wilkins attributed the victory
to hard campaigning and fre-
quent trips to the Rockbridge
and Augusta portions of the

district, which has its seat in
Amherst.

“We worked like _hell,”’
Wilkins said. ‘‘I drove over the
mountain, an hour trip from my

He also said that Sauder's
“credibility suffered when she
made charges she couldn’t back
up.”

Independent Union launches plans

by STEVE POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

Weekend road trips, non-
party functions and weekend
bands in the Cockpit were
among several ideas suggested
for independent entertainment
at the first Independent Student
Union meeting last Thursday.

About 64 students as well as
Dean of Students Lewis G. John
and Associate Dean of Students
Michael A. Cappetto attended
the meeting where students
aired their opinions about the
need for and function of an in-
dependent union.

The meeting was the result of
initiatives taken by junior
Joseph Cadle and sophomore
Jim Sarle. Cadle and Sarle
spoke to the EC at its Monday
night meeting about the sugges-
tions made at the independent
union meeting.

“Bob Jenevein (EC presi-
dent) said they were valid ques-
tions,” Sarle said. ‘“‘He didn’t
feel that the EC could answer
them right on the spot.”’

Jenevein said that he and
Cadle will meet with the EC
subcommittee on independent
student affairs soon.

Sarle said he was impressed
by the turnout at the orginiza-
tional meeting.

“There were more than just
Joe and I running the meeting,”’
he said. Sarle noted that since
the meeting, an additional 15
students have come to him ex-
pressing interest in the union.

The co-chairmen’s next move
will be to send out a question-
naire next week. They said they
already have a list of students
who are interested in playing
winter intramural sports. A
bulletin board located near the
Cockpit in the University
Center will be used for an-
noucements concerning the
union, Sarle said.

The next meeting of the in-
dependent union will be in the
week following Thanksgiving
vacation and Sarle said that he
is hoping to have a faculty ad-
visory committee by that time.

‘They were overjoyed’

WGL grad injured in Grenada invasion says students

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

Tuesday, Oct. 25, was a busy
day for Syd Farrar.

The 1980 Washington and Lee
graduate, a first lieutenant in
the 75th Ranger Battalion, took
off from Barbados on a C-130
transport plane and parachuted
into the Point Salines, Grenada,
airstrip before dawn that morn-
ing.

Farrar was leading a 35-man
platoon that was in the first
wave of American troops to in-
vade the tiny Caribbean island.
Less than a week before, the
assassination of Prime Minister
Maurice Bishop had led the
United States to believe Cubans

and Russians were intervening
in (Grenada’s) affairs.

President Ronald Reagan
decided that weekend to send
American troops into Grenada.

The airfield onto which Far-
rar jumped also concerned the
Reagan administration. Cuban
construction workers were ex-
tending the runway beyond a
length normally required for
the island. Many of those con-
struction workers were actually
Cuban soldiers.

Farrar discussed his role in

After clearing the airfield by
7:30 that morning, Farrar’s pla-
toon was assigned to secure the
True Blue campus of the St.
George’s University School of
Medicine, where several hun-
dred American students were
studying.

Farrar contacted two student
leaders at the school and told
them ‘‘who we were and that
there was nothing to be scared
of.”’

“They were overjoyed. They
were ready to get out of there,”’
Farrar added. ‘They had
figured they were under some
sort of threat. They were very
happy to see us.”

Later that afternoon, Farrar
was leading a small patrol try-
ing to locate other friendly
troops. ‘‘I stepped out into a
road and caught some rounds,”’
Farrar said.

“The guys just happened to
be there and I happened to be

One bullet went through his
arm, breaking his humerus
bone into several pieces, and
then entered his lungs. Another
bullet ‘‘nicked” his hip.

Farrar said his arm was in a
brace and the tubes had been
taken out of his chest. ‘‘I’m feel-
ing pretty good right now,”’ he
added. He was listed in satisfac-
tory condition Tuesday.

Barring pneumonia or other
infection, Farrar said he should

have to return to the hospital
afterward.

Farrar would not say when he

By G. BRUCE POTTER

The Executive Committee
spent a good portion of its
longest non-budgetary meeting
of the year Monday night clari-
fying its policy regarding the
signing of honor cards with
representatives of the law
school.

Last week, the EC had decid-
ed that upperclass law students
who did not sign honor cards
would not be allowed to vote in
the spring’s EC elections. First-

were happy to see Rangers

little bit stronger than what we
had expected.

“There were certainly other
elements that we didn’t think
were going to be there. We had
expected little or no_resis-
tance.”’

Farrar indicated that all the
Americans’ goals were ac-
complished and that the troops
had planned to stay only a few
days.

Asked whether he supported
the decision to invade Grenada,
Farrar said, ‘“‘Without a doubt. I
was ready to go. Everybody in
the battalion was ready to go.
We were fully supportive of
Reagan and the Chiefs of Staff
in their decision to do such a
thing.

“After the failure of the Ira-
nian hostage rescue mission,
American armed forces needed
to show that they were powerful
and that they could put forces
where they wanted to when they
wanted to.

“We did just that.’’

Farrar said he also supported
the decision not to allow media
representatives onto the island
until the fighting had moved
toward conclusion. ‘‘The media

tends to distort the actualities
and the facts,” he said.

“If it had got to the media, I
can assure you, we would have
had 10 times as many people
killed. I would have been scared
to death of the plans being leak-
ed somehow, and they (the
enemy) would be waiting for us
when we dropped out of the
clouds.’’

While at Washington and Lee,
Farrar, an English major, was
president of the Interfraternity
Council and Phi Delta Theta
and co-captain of the 1979 foot-
ball team.

“IT got a hell of a leadership
experience (at W&L),” he said.

“The leadership experience I
got there helped me many times
over in the military.”’

He joined the ROTC at W&L
for what he descirbed as ‘‘corny
reasons’’: his father fought in
World War II and Vietnam, and
Farrar viewed serving in the
armed forces as ‘‘a duty...I ow-
ed it to my country.”

Farrar said he has only one
regret about deciding to join the
ROTC: “I don’t get to see my
wife enough.”

to bridge gap

year law students normally sign
these cards upon matriculation,
as do freshmen, but ‘‘an over-
sight of EC’s in the past,’’ said
President Bob Jenevein, led to
the second- and third-year law
students’ never having signed
‘these cards.

Second-year law student
Bruce Poole, one of several law
students at the meeting, said
“It looks as though the com-
munication problem between
the undergraduates and the law
school has flared up again.”’

The law students expressed a

concern that the EC was ques-
tioning their honor, but Jene-
vein explained, ‘‘All we’re do-
ing is restoring our old prac-
tice.”

Senior law _ representative

honor cards and an explanatory
letter to law students last Fri-
day. As of Monday, Green said,
60 to 70 signed cards had been
returned.

Washington break spared

Faculty nixes plan to trim holiday by three days

By COLE DAWSON
Staff Reporter

The faculty decided Monday
not to shorten the 1985 Washing-
ton’s Birthday break from five
to two days, in accordance with
a vote by the University Coun-
cil.

That proposal, for the 1984-85
calendar, was developed by the
Faculty Executive Committee,
which consists of ten faculty
and two student members.

The ’85 winter term would
have begun on Thursday Jan. 3,
instead of Jan. 7; and the
Washington break would have
begun after classes Wednesday
Feb. 13 and resumed the follow-
ing Monday.

The central idea behind the
changes was to make gradua-
tion a week earlier. Next year’s
graduation date, June 7, will
throw W&L students into the
summer job market much later
than most other schools.

The Faculty E.C. drew up the
proposal as an alternative to
what they believe might be a
detriment to some students’ job
opportunities. The shortened
break, they believe, could have
also been a viable time for Fan-
cy Dress.

The student members on the
University Council voted 7-1
against the proposed calendar.
According to junior UC repre-
sentative Marc Monyek, the
biggest complaint concerned
the shortened winter break.

The student representatives
felt the Washington vacation is
one that students need in order

to break up the harsh winter
term. Professors also use this
time to catch up on their
grading. It might also be dif-
ficult to arrange Fancy Dress at
this time because of conflicts
with the athletic department.
The Council believed that
many students would cut the
first two days of winter term

i a yg,

(Thursday and Friday) in order

to extend their Christmas vaca-
tion.

Monyek felt the U.C. mem-
bers should have been given
prior notice of the proposed
calendar so that more campus-
wide input could have been
brought into Thursday’s
meeting.

The proposed Honors and
Capstone courses were also
discussed by the University

Council. These would be team-

taught inderdepartmental
seminars, such as _ econo-
mics/sociology. They would be
taught by a professor from each
department.

The courses would be cross-
listed and would be offered for
credit in the appropriate ma-
jors.

Monyek commented that the
outline for these courses was a
bit vague but he felt they were a
good idea and should be geared
toward the spring term.

 

EC

your understanding about us
and our understanding about
you.”

“It’s definitely a problem of
communication,’’ she added.

Other students complained
that there was no legal distinc-
tion between signing honor
cards and obeying the honor
code while such a distinction did
exist between whether or not
one could vote.

The EC voted unanimously
for Green to word his ex-
planatory letter to indicate that
the EC has no doubts about law
students’ integrity. On an 11-1,
vote, with freshman represen-
tative Andrew Caruthers oppos-
ed, the EC also established the
policy of requiring the cards to
be signed before law students
could vote in elections. .

The EC also heard a report
from Joe Cadle and Jim Sarle of
the independent union regar-
ding that group’s first meeting
last Thursday.

Cadle said there was ‘‘a near-
ly unanimous strong interest
shown for weekend bands inthe

il, an ln,

Cockpit and/or non-party social
functions.”

Representatives of the Stu-
dent Activities Board pointed
out that previous weekend
Cockpit bands have not been
very successful.

‘“‘We feel our job is to provide
schoolwide functions for in-
dependents and _ everyone,”’
treasurer John Haywood said.
“We're not afraid to lose money
in some areas and make up for
it in others. We did some Satur-
day night bands last year and
the attendance has never been
good. We have to look at it on a
school-wide basis, not just one
group.”’

The EC decided to let its in-
dependent subcommittee, form-
ed last week and chaired by
secretary Len Howard, debate
ways of solving the issue. Cadle,

Rohrig criticizes SAC decision

By TIM McCUNE
Staff Reporter

“It’s quite obvious that the
Student Affairs Committee
doesn’t want me to come back.”

Tom Rohrig made these com-
ments in the wake of the three-
year suspension given to him by
the Student Affairs Committee.

“I’m just trying to take it in
stride. They could have expell-
ed me, which would have looked
a lot worse on my record.”

The Student Control Commit-
tee, an all-student group,
recommended that Rohrig be
given a one-year suspension
beginning at the end of the
term. The Student Affairs Com-
mittee, a group comprised of
students and representatives
from the faculty, increased the
suspension to three years. The
Student Affairs Committee
automatically reviews all deci-
sions of the Student Control
Committee when an expulsion
or suspension is involved. _

Rohrig said that he believes
he knows why the Student Af-
fairs Committee was more
severe than the Student Control
Committee.

“There is a lot more support
and sympathy from the stu-
dents than from the administra-
tion. I could almost feel the
deans putting a nail in my cof-
fin.”’

Commonwealth’s Attorney
Beverly C. ‘John’ Read has
repeatedly referred to Rohrig’s
case, telling how Rohrig ‘‘risk-
ed his life’’ to set up a major
drug dealer.

According to Rohrig, this
didn’t matter to the Student Af-
fairs Committee.

“‘They didn’t care about what
I did, turning state’s evidence.
They didn’t care about Sen-
sabaugh (the dealer). They
think that I’m a blemish or a
taint on the campus. They’re
wrong. They don’t know any-
thing about me, what I feel or
who I am. I try not to let what

people say about me bother
me.”

The three-year suspension
will, for all practical purposes,
prevent Rohrig from finishing
his education at Washington
and Lee.

‘I’m kind of upset that I can’t
graduate from here — it’s a
pretty fine institution. I think
being a Washington and Lee
grad would help me in more
ways than being a grad from
Central Michigan. I’m going to
apply to some state schools. A
lot of people will ask questions
and I’ll have to spill my guts.
Some places will say thanks,
but no thanks. I need a diploma

to do what I want to do, to be a
trader in the stock market. I’ll
just have to see what happens.”’

Rohrig is still awaiting
sentencing. While he was
attending classes he was releas-
ed from the Rockbridge County
Jail as part of a work release
program. As a result of the
suspension his work release

program has been discontinued. -

About the jail, Rohrig said
that “It’s pretty nice here.’’
Even as he said it, he did not
seem to believe his own words.
He puffed nervously on a
cigarette and glanced around
the room. Earlier he had men-
tioned that the dealer he had set

up was being held upstairs. The
jailer, overhearing part of the
conversation, remarked joking-
ly that he had better not say
anything bad about the jail or
they would stop being so nice to
him. Rohrig assured him that
he wouldn’t think of saying
anything like that.

Rohrig said he isn’t bitter
about what happened. “‘I’m still
extremely optimistic. In fact
I’m more optimistic and more
enthusiastic about the future
than I’ve ever been in my life. I
know I can still do a very com-
petent job — even though I’m a -
convicted felon. It doesn’t mean
I’m going to live in a gutter
from now on.”’

Dederick, Ham warn against
‘snowball effect’ of drugs

By KEVIN McCLATCHY
Special to the Phi

In a recent drug-awareness
program at Lexington High
School, two former Washington
and Lee students shared their
experiences with drugs with
local high school students.

Bill Dederick and Marc Ham
were among a panel of five
speakers to talk with the
students. Other participating
were Lexington Police Chief
Lawrence QO. Sutton and Com-
monwealth’s Attorney John
Read, who organized the pro-
gram and Rockbridge County
Sheriff's Department Capt.
Fred Spence.

Both Sutton and Spence each
gave brief talks on drugs and
their potential effects, but Ham
and Dederick were the ones who
carried the program. The stu-
dents were able to identify with
them more than with three
authority figures.

Dederick and Ham both re-
lated their own personal ex-

periences to the students and
pointed out the reality of the
consequences waiting for those
people who get involved with
drugs.

“I don’t want any of you to go
through what I went through,”
said Ham. “If I can keep just
one of you out of trouble by
relating my personal experi-
ences to you, then it’s (the pro-
gram) with it.”’

Ham also called drug involve-
ment ‘‘a road to self-destruc-
tion.’’ He explained that drugs
have a “‘snowball effect’”’ on a
person. He started with recrea-
tional use of drugs and wound
up dealing in large quantities of
drugs. ‘‘The danger of cocaine
is that psychologically once you
start, you want more all the
time,’’ said Ham. Ham added
that drugs are “not worth it,
they are illegal, bad for your
health, and they lead you to hurt
the people around you.”

Dederick’s talk was similar to
Ham’s. He also referred to the
‘snowball effect’? of drugs.

Both began selling drugs to sup-
port their own habits. “People I
cared about took a backseat to
drugs. My priorities were all
mixed up,’”’ said Dederick. “I
threw away a lot of things just
to get high. It was ridiculous,”
added Dederick.

Spence had nothing but praise
for Dederick and Ham as volun-
teers in the program. ‘‘Billy and
Marc were very anxious to help.
They showed a genuine interest
in doing something that must be
very difficult for them,’’ Spence
said.

Dederick explained why he is
involved in the program, ‘I
wouldn’t wish what I have gone
through on anyone. I have
learned a lot of valuable
lessons. I hope sharing my ex-
periences will prevent someone
from learning the hard way.”

Tom Rohrig, a Washington
and Lee student also serving a
jail sentence for drug-related
crimes, will also be involved in
the program.

sound, and the attitudes them-
selves have evolved from one of
constant disobedience and total
disregard for the house, into one
of deep concern and
brotherhood toward the frater-
nity. Perhaps the Fiji of my
freshman year could have
merited an action such as the
SAC has recently deemed
necessary, but certainly not the
fraternity which it has grown
into this year.

During my first year at this
school, there was a fraternity
kicked off campus, that being
the old Sigma Nu. The reasons
for that decision included a debt
of over $5000 to the university, a

in gaining a good education
(which has nothing to do with
grades) or a college degree?
Does W&L turn out gentlemen
or men with bachelor’s de-
grees?

These are important ques-
tions to consider. The essential
question of coeducation is
whether the introduction of
women would significantly
alter the answers to these ques-
tions and how they would be
altered. The argument, offered
by some of us, that the quality
of education would go down
with the introduction of the op-
posite sex, is hardly an argu-
ment of a gentleman. A gentle-
man finds unsubstantiated in-
sult distasteful
engaging in it. So far I have
seen no evidence that the in-
troduction of women would
cause W&L’s quality of educa-
tion to go down. Indeed, the
comparison in last week’s Phi
with Davidson seemed to in-
dicate that they have a better

house which was incapable of
habitation, a destructive
nature, and a basic feeling that
their fraternity could no longer
contribute anything worthwhile
to this university and its frater-
nity system. And even with this
strong rationale, there was
much controversy over that
decision, and yet this year’s
SAC would casually kick a
fraternity off campus which in
no way resembles the old Sigma
Nu.

The Fraternity of Phi Gam-
ma Delta is financially sound
and in good standing with the

than we do. Nor have I seen
comparative evidence concern-
ing alumni support. Will W&L
grads not consider a coed W&L
their alma mater? Will they en-
courage their children to go
elsewhere (like Hampden-
Sydney)?

I say a good education can be
obtained here, but I still wonder
whether most of us who gradu-
ate have bothered to get one.
Have we taken advantage of the
education offered us? I think
not. For evidence, I offer a few
random examples of faculty
comment. But first an example
of the respect we give our pro-
fessors:

I have a course this term held
in an auditorium. Every class
has been attended by a majority
of the students as well as one
puppy dog. Don’t get me wrong,
he’s a great puppy. He wanders
all over the room, romps with
other dogs, has a jingling collar,
likes to chew up erasers, will go
outside and bring in the occa-
sional dead bird, and, in short,
provides an excellent diversion

They have been convicted of on-
ly two violations this year for
which a more than adequate
probation of eight weeks was
imposed. In addition, Fijis are
seen in every facet of university
life. They are active in ac-
tivities that vary from this
year’s Rush Chairman to the
head of the Cockpit, from
several dorm counselors to
numerous ROTC cadets. They
are active in most sports here at
W&L, including football,
lacrosse, wrestling, basketball,
baseball, golf, cross country,
fencing and soccer. In addition,
Fiji has maintained a cumula-
tive GPA above the combined
student body average for the
past three years as well as plac-

ing in the top six in IMs. And
one of last year’s valedictorians
and three all-ODAC players
were among those numerous F'i-
ji graduates that are constantly
bringing prestige to this univer-
sity. It is apparent from these
acheivements that Phi Gamma
Delta is indeed involved with, if
not an integral part, of this
university, and it is unfortunate
that the SAC would deprive this
fraternity of the good which it is
capable of offering.

However, I am concerned not
merely with the outcome of Fiji
in this battle, but with all of the
fraternities here at this univer-
sity. The new administration
has already expressed its inten-
tions of limiting the number of

fraternities which remain here
at Washington and Lee in order
to make the way for the propos-
ed plan of co-education some
time in the future, and if a
fraternity such as Phi Gamma
Delta can be kicked off campus
for these petty incidents, then
who will be next? I do not
believe that a handful of com-
mittee members and Deans
should be able to casually kick a
fraternity off campus because
of reasons which do not in-
herently demand expulsion, for
if they are allowed such folly,
then no chapter here at W&L is
truly safe from such a disaster.

from the topic at hand.

Three days a ‘veek, I sit in a
class which is renowned for its
rigors and taken mostly by
those required to do so for their
major. By force of habit, the
professor always opens the
class with a simple question
dealing with the day’s short
reading assignment. Once or
twice someone’s guessed the

assigned reading.’’

Another professor asked a
large 200 level English course I
was in last year what season
Frost’s ‘“‘Oven-bird”’ was set in.
(The answer is the third word of
the second line: ‘‘mid-
summer’’). However, no one in
the class would admit to know-
ing that. The professor replied
that the poem was set in

“I say a good education

can be obtained here, but...”’

 

answer with some clues and a
bit of prodding. Otherwise, the
professor grins and chuckles at
us. We grin back, relieved that
he, like most of the others, has
gone beyond indignation and
passed into an accepted amuse-
ment at the consistency of our
lack of concern and interest.
They say humor is at bottom
repetition.

Myth has it that another pro-
fessor, in search of advice from
a wiser elder in his department,
received as an answer to a
query on how to ensure student
preparation: ‘‘Not even
Yahweh Himself could make

the students at W&L do their

turkey in the oven for Thanks-
giving...He elaborated a few
moments before noticing that
students were taking notes.

In a History seminar last year
(seminar, by common practice,
means a discussion-class), I
was ina class where a professor
asked for questions on the
assigned reading. When no one
offered any, he pushed further,
asking several students. He
gave the whole class a second,
final chance. No one had any.
He dismissed the class. We all
agreed he was in a bad mood
and would, we hoped be better
next time. He was. He didn’t
ask us for questions. -

Legend has it that a professor
was on the faculty committee
which recently came up with
the changed graduation re-
quirements. He described the
committee’s task as like “rear-
ranging the deck chairs on the
Titanic.”

A general disgust or genteel
amusement is how I feel the
faculty views our intellectual
abilities. Oh, we’re nice enough
chaps, all right. But the above
incidents are just examples and
not isolated ones. Why should
the faculty care? They are of-
fering us an education and few
of us bother to accept. Here is
the problem beneath the pro-
blem. What in our lifestyle
hampers us from accepting this
opportunity to be educated?
These are the things which the
administration ought to change.
If coeducation will bring us
brighter and more eager
students, then it will create a
better W&L. That is how the
Trustees ought to view the ques-
tion. Social life must be a secon-
dary concern to this decision.
No matter what sort of student
body W&L has — coed or not,
with frats or without them — it
will have a social life; all col-
leges do.

I find most of Mr. Matrazzo’s
points valid. I do not feel,
however, that we can place the
blame on the staff for unen-
thusiastic teaching. ‘‘The free
interplay of ideas and the ideas
of moral and _ intellectual
growth” aren’t stifled; there’s
nothing to stifle. On the con-
trary, when a student is in-
terested in the pursuit of
knowledge and wisdom, I think
the faculty is generally at first
astonished and full of sound ad-
vice and interest.

Finally, I close with an
acknowledgment that I speak
as someone who is guilty of
what I herein condemn. Well,
Mr. Matrazzo, I trust I am put-
ting myself in shoes not unlike
yours. We shall see what reac-

tions I get. Tom Connors

A new beat

Students form jazz quintet

‘‘Who’s Buyin’,’’ a new ‘‘Kool
Jazz’’ quintet, has been formed
at Washington and Lee Univer-
sity and is composed of students

from W&L’s Glee Club and the

Brass and Percussion Ensem-
ble.

According to Robert Stewart,
professor of music and director
of the Brass and Percussion
Ensemble, the new quintet
features a repertoire of such
standards ‘‘As Time Goes By,”’
“Take the A Train,’ and
‘‘Autumn Leaves.”’

The quintet will be composed
of a percussion, trumpet/flugel

horn, saxophone, bass, and
piano.
Members of the quintet are:

—Barthe vanDoorn, a senior

from Herndon, Va., and a per-
cussionist with the Brass and
Percussion Ensemble;

—Jim Davis, a senior from

Shreveport, La., who is a soloist
on trumpet and flugel horn with
the W&L Jazz Lab Band;

—Whitney Gadsby, a junior
from Wilmington, Del., a sax-
ophonist with the W&L Jazz Lab
Band;

—Chris Fure, a freshman
from Berkeley, Cal., who plays
the bass and was second in the
state of California at the
Monterey Jazz Festival;

—Bruin Richardson, a
sophomore from Port Huron,
Mich., who accompanies the
W&L Glee Club on the piano and
has played in jazz ensembles in
the Port Huron area.

‘“‘Who’s Buyin’ ”’ hopes to be
able to perform for private par-
ties, dinners and receptions.

For information on booking
the new quintet, contact
Whitney Gadsby at 463-6043 or

Trio will open concert series

The Burdette Trio will pre-
sent the first program in the
1983-84 Washington and Lee
Concert Guild series at 8 p.m.,
Monday, Nov. 14, in Lee Chapel.

Tickets are $4 for adults and
$2 for non-W&L_ students.
Season tickets for all four Con-
cert Guild performances are
still available at a cost of $12 for
adults and $6 for non-W&L
students. (Members of the
Washington and Lee communi-
ty are admitted without
charge.)

The Burdette Trio is a
chamber ensemble whose
delicate blend of piano, cello
and violin has been hailed by
many critics not only for the
trio’s technical proficiency but
also for their understanding of
the genre.

The program for the Burdette
Trio’s W&L concert will be
Beethoven’s ‘‘Trio in E-flat Ma-
jor, Opus 1, No. 1,” ‘Three Noc-
turnes’’ by Ernest Bloch and

“Trio in B Major, Opus 8” by

Brahms. 2
The Burdette Trio came

together an as ensemble in the

summer of 1977 at the Meadow-

mount Schoo! of Music while
completing master’s programs
at the Juilliard School.

Since then, the trio has ap-
peared at Alice Tully Hall, the
Juilliard Theater in Lincoln
Center and the summer
chamber music series at Stony
Brook University, among many
other places.

Moot court team places second

A national moot court team

A second team from the
Washington and Lee law school
finished among the top four in
the competition, losing to their
W&L classmates in the semi-
final round.

The Washington and Lee
team competed against a team
from the Wake Forest law
school in the championship

Exhibit called ‘striking ’

By SCOTT PRYSE
Staff Reporter

The current installation in du-
Pont Gallery, ‘‘Extensions of
Time and Space,” by Edith
Frohock, has generated a great
deal of excitement and con-
troversy among W&L students
and faculty. Comments in the
Gallery visitor’s book have call-
ed Ms. Frohock’s work every-
thing from ‘‘a waste of time’”’ to
a “daring and provocative”
creation. Specifically, viewers
have called it ‘‘childish,”’ ‘‘ab-
normal’’ and even ‘“‘the work of
a monkey.’ At the same time
several admirers have seen it
as ‘“‘striking,” “intriguing” and
‘full of imagination.”

Whether or not people like
this exhibit is really not impor-
tant to the artist or the gallery.
The present installation is sup-
posed to give us something to
think about. Unlike a traditional
exhibit, this show invites, even
insists, that the viewer become
a participant. The idea behind
an installation is that the actual
space in the gallery should
become integral to the entire

work. Frohock chose to make
this exhibit an_ installation
because she enjoys the element
of chance that is introduced
with viewer participation. She
is also interested in time as a
dimension in the installation.

In an interview last week, the
artist stated that in the work
she tries to show ‘“‘the dif-
ference between time as an
abstract idea and time as the
experience of duration; one
having to do with symbolic ex-
pression, the other rooted in
physical fact.” On a table in the
gallery is a book called “Time
Screen” which has_inter-
changeable multicolored panels
to be manipulated by the viewer
to create unique and personal
visual images. This is linked to
the rest of the installation by an
electronic music piece.

The music, like the ‘Time
Screen,’’ is meant to enhance
the viewer’s experience of time
and space set up by the artist.
According to the composer,
Doug Carroll of Alabama,
“Pantheism I,” recorded last
summer, is ‘‘a tape piece that is
comprised of musique concrete,

sounds include students talking

in approximately 20 different
languages, various machines,
several types of animals and an
array of weather-produced

generated sounds came from
synthesizers and tape effects.

The acoustically generated
sounds include cello, piano and

which was inspired by the pain-
tings, plays continuously in the
Gallery.

Frohock incorporated many
ideas from the Orient into her
work. The rhoplex. panels of
blue, red, white and black stand
for the ancient Chinese
discrimination of east, south,
west, and north, respectively.
‘‘Astronomer’s Bowl,”’ the plex-
iglass sculpture on the floor in
the center of the gallery, was
inspired by an observatory in
India. Its yellow base signifies
the harmony of earth and man.

For many people at Washing-
ton and Lee ‘Extensions in
Time and Space’’ is a new form
of artistic expression and due to
viewer response, duPont plans
to exhibit several installations
of this kind in the near future.
This show will remain in the
Gallery thru Nov. 18.

General comeback stuns CU ,22-21

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
Generals clinched their fourth
consecutive winning season last
Saturday with a_ last-second
22-21 victory over the Catholic
University Cardinals.

The Generals drove 65 yards
during the last six minutes of
the game, scoring with eleven
seconds remaining on a seven-
yard pass from quarterback
Bobby Wilson to tight end Rob
Brown. Wilson then hit tailback
Gene Girard in the corner of the
end zone for the two-point con-
version and the victory.

Head coach Gary Fallon said
there was no hesitation in mak-
ing the decision to go for the win
rather than the tie. ““‘We’d come
too far on that drive to settle for
anything less than the win,”
Fallon stated.

The game was close the entire
way as the two teams traded
touchdowns throughout the
afternoon. Catholic got on the
scoreboard first when quarter-
back Tony Gallis hit Walt
Kalinowski for a_ six-yard
touchdown, giving the Car-
dinals an early 7-0 lead.

The Generals tied the game
midway through the second
quarter when strong safety Tim
Janyska picked off a Gallis pass
and returned it 22 yards to
paydirt. James White added the
point after, knotting the score at
7-7. Neither team could manage
another score before the half.

W&L took the lead at 14-7
when Gene Girard scored on a
nine-yard run with 4:20 remain-
ing in the third quarter. This
lead was short-lived, however,
as Catholic quickly answered
with a 25-yard Gallis to John
Hildreth touchdown pass that
tied the score at 14-14 with 1:54
left in the third quarter.
Catholic took the lead in the
fourth quarter when quarter-
back Gallis again connected
with Kalinowski, this time for a
10-yard score. After Mike Can-
non added his third PAT of the
day, Catholic led 21-14 with only
6:20 remaining to be played.

Starting at their own 35 yard
line, the Generals put together
the game-winning drive of 17
plays. Of these 17 plays, all but
one, the touchdown pass with 11
seconds remaining, were run-
ning plays.

“‘On that last drive, we simply
took it right at them. We didn’t
do anything fancy,” Fallon
said. ‘‘The offensive line took
control of the line of scrim-
mage, and our backs just ran
hard. That was a very good
defensive football team that we
played against. We hadn't
underestimated them at all.’’

The Generals relied primari-
ly on their rushing attack
against Catholic, gaining 227 of
their 267 total yards on the
ground. Fallon praised his run-
ning backs after the game.

day’s W&L victory over the Catholic Cardinals, (Photo by Rick Swagler)

“Gene Girard (142 yards, 33
carries) must have felt like he’d
wrestled two bears. I hadn’t
planned to have him run the ball
33 times, but we needed to have
him and he gave us 110 percent
again,”’ Fallon stated. “Frank
Surface’s blocking was sensa-
tional. Kevin Weaver (79 yards,
11 carries) came in and ran ex-
ceptionally well,” he added.

Fallon was also pleased with
his defense, citing its ability to

make the key play as a crucial

factor in the victory. ‘Catholic
threw the ball real well against
us, but we came up with some
big defensive plays like Kelvin
Newsome’s interception in the
end zone and Tim Janyska’s in-
terception return for a
touchdown,”’ Fallon said.

W&L hosts the Lebanon
Valley Flying Dutchmen this
Saturday in their season finale.
The game will be part of
Parents’ Weekend activities.
Lebanon Valley is 2-6-1 on the
year and a relative unknown to
coach Fallon.

“IT don’t know beans about
this team, except that they have
played some tough teams,”
Fallon stated. ‘‘What I’m anx-
ious to see now is whether this
group will be content to have a
winning season or whether
they'll be hungry to get that
sixth victory against Lebanon
Valley. Based on what I’ve seen
thus far, I think I know the
answer. We'll be ready to
play.”

SIDELINE: The Generals
dedicated the game ball from
Saturday’s victory to Syd Far-
rar, tri-captain of the 1979 W&L
football team. Farrar was
wounded last month in Grenada
and is currently in Walter Reed
Hospital in Washington. The
ball will be delivered to him as
soon as it is inscribed.

Girard, White
slash former
season marks

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

Three Washington and Lee
single season records were sur-
passed last Saturday in the
Generals’ 22-21 victory over
Catholic University.

Tailback Gene Girard
established new records for
both touchdowns and scoring
for one season. Girard scored
eight points (one touchdown,
one two-point conversion)
against Catholic to raise his
point total for the season to 68,
four more than the mark set by
Bob Funkhouser 24 years ago.
Girard also broke the single
season touchdown record, eclip-
sing Chris Cavalline’s 1981
record of ten by one score.

Girard has the chance to set
yet another record this Satur-
day against Lebanon Valley. He
has 854 yards rushing for the
year and needs only 75 yards
against Lebanon Valley to pass
the school record of 928 yards
set by Stewart Atkinson in 1979.
In addition, Girard could
become the first 1,000-yard
rusher in W&L history if he
gains 146 yards this Saturday. It
is worth noting that Girard has
accomplished these things play-
ing a nine-game schedule while
Atkinson and Cavalline set their
records during a _ ten-game
schedule.

The third record set last
Saturday belongs to place-
kicker James White. White had
two extra points against
Catholic, bringing his season
total to 24, without a miss, one
more than the record set by Bill
Devine, who was good for 23 of
24 attempts in 1981.

Four times a charm as
Polo stops Richmond, 7-4

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
water polo team won its third
consecutive Southern League ti-
tle last weekend by defeating
the University of Richmond 7-4
in the final game of the
Southern League Champion-
ships. The tournament was
played in W&L’s Cy Twombly
Pool.

The Generals, 23-9 on the
season, won all five of their
games in the tournament. In ad-
dition to defeating Richmond,
W&L defeated Lynchburg 24-2,
George Washington 12-6, Duke
10-8 and Virginia Com-
monwealth 11-7,

The Generals controlled the
Richmond game from the start.
W&L scored the first four goals
of the game. Richmond did not
score a goal until the second
quarter.

quarter, when a series of Spider
tallies reduced the Generals’
margin to 5-4.

W&L ended Richmond’s
hopes for victory by scoring two
goals early in the fourth
quarter.

Commenting on the Generals’
victory over Richmond, head
water polo coach Page
Remillard said, “They (Rich-
mond) came out flat.’’

Richmond had defeated W&L
three times this season before
losing to the Generals last
weekend. Explaining the
Generals’ victory, Remillard
said, ‘‘W&L championship
teams have always played well
at the end of the season.”

Coach Remillard cited
freshmen Dan Trice and
Charlie Groh for outstanding
play against Richmond. Trice
won a sprint and scored a goal
early in the second quarter.
Groh blocked a Richmond pen-
alty shot also in the second
quarter. “‘They were two guys

 

 

who stood out because we did
not expect them to,” said
Remillard.

Because they qualified for the
finals of the Southern League,
W&L and Richmond will par-
ticipate in the Eastern Region
of the NCAA Division I water
polo tournament. In addition to
W&L and Richmond, teams
from Brown, Navy, Slippery
Rock, Bucknell, Harvard and
the University of Massachu-
setts will participatc. The tour-
nament will be played this
weekend at the Naval Academy
in Annapolis, Md. The
Generals’ first game will be
against Slippery Rock on Satur-
day.

Concerning the Eastern
Region, Remillard said, ‘This
is the most balanced Eastern
Region that I can remember.”’
The top two finishers in the
Eastern Region qualify for the
National tournament which will
be played in Long Beach, Calif.

Five out of
eight ain’t bad

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

...It is one thing to win a close
football game. It is another
thing entirely to win the way the
Generals did last Saturday.
Just some facts for those of you
who were watching the Florida-
Georgia or Auburn-Maryland
games or were engaged in some
other equally trivial task rather
than having all attention focus-
ed on Wilson Field: First, the
teams were never more than a
touchdown apart. Second, the
final touchdown was the result
of an 18-play drive against the
best defense in the conference.
Third, three records were
broken by Generals during the
course of the afternoon. And
fourth, Gene Girard had anoth-
er typical day for him, as his
142-yard effort put him just 75
yards shy of another W&L sing-
le-season mark. It was not by
any means an expertly played
contest, but perhaps this lack of
perfection is simply a reflection
of how evenly the two teams

played each other. Above
everything else, one thing
stands clear about this football

Time out...

team. When concentrated pres-
sure mounts, they have been
able to rise to meet it. The
Generals faced and conquered
do-or-die situations both last
Saturday and in the early
season 28-21 victory over R-MC.
Frankly, I don’t wee any other
ODAC team capable of replica-
ting such feats. The bottom line
is that W&L has the best team in
the conference. It’s just that it’s
been shown only five times this
season, instead of eight...
....More sports notes from the
colonnade. If Mr. Girard goes,
over 1,000 yards for the season,
an achievement surprisingly
not out of the question, he
deserves unanimous All-Ameri-
can _ selection...Speaking of
superstars in your own
backyard, you’ll never guess’

enough to retain the Old Domi-

Coach Miller also noted that
Roanoke appeared the stronger
team. ‘‘We knew going into the
meet that in order to win the
team title we would have to split
up Roanoke’s top three runners,
but we just weren’t able to do
that.”” Coach Miller was not
about to make excuses. ‘You
can’t let a course bother you.
It’s a mental problem, not
physical,”’ he said.

Also scoring for the second-
place Generals were Frank
Pittman, Ted Myers, Eddie
Goundry and Cameron Adams.

Lex High grid coach center of controversy

By PAULCLARK
Staff Reporter

The question of the over em-
phasis on athletics in high
school education has hit close to
home.

Chaos that threatens to split
Lexington High School, and
possibly even the city, has
erupted around Lexington
High’s football team. The con-
troversy stems from. the
suspension and reinstatement
of head football coach Ron
Pyles, and from reports that he
has assaulted several of his
players.

The issue has been evolving
for some time but began to take
on steam back in August, when
Lexington High School hired a
football coach who was to be the
savior of the team. Two weeks
later, the coach quit his posi-

tion, citing ‘‘personal pro-
blems”’ as the reason for his
departure.

Later that month Ron Pyles,

the sixth coach in seven years,
was hired so Lexington could
‘eld a team this year. Little
background checking was done
because of the urgency of the
situation. Said Jerry Darrell,
the W&L food service director
and a man with a genuine in-

terest in Lexington High School,
‘“T heard nice things about
him...but shortly thereafter
problems arose.”’

After the second or third
game of the season, Lexington
assistant coaches Doug Chase,
a W&L alumnus, and Dave
Melton asked to see the prin-
cipal of the high school, Glen
Stark, so they could voice some
of their concerns about the way
the football team was being run.
Stark then decided that their
allegations against Coach Pyles

 

 

SAFEWAY

were serious enough to require
a meeting between Coach
Pyles, assistant coaches Chase
and Melton, principal Stark and
school superintendent Jim Jay.

At that meeting Chase and
Melton voiced their grievances
before Jay, after which Jay
suspended Pyles on the spot,
stripping him of all duties as
teacher, coach and athletic
director. Jay also directed
Chase and Melton to take over
the football team and called for
a meeting of parents and foot-
ball players that evening.

The meeting that night
resembled a kind of ‘‘witch
hunt,’ said Darrell. ‘There
were two camps...a pro-Pyles
camp and an anti-Pyles camp.”
According to Darrell most of
the parents were ‘‘stunned”’ to
find out the nature of the allega-
tions and the action Jay had
taken against Pyles. ‘Many of
us were confused as to what was
happening,’’ added Darrell.

Principal Stark stated that he
fully supported the action Jay
had taken and furthermore, had
recommended it. ‘‘The meeting
turned into a shouting match
—it really got wild... people
screaming at each otner. wvar-
rell recalled. ‘‘This has turned
into a very serious matter.”

When the problem gained

parents of the high schoolers
called for an executive session
on the matter. In the hearing,
Coach Pyles was questioned by
the board and the parents were
allowed a five-minute appoint-
ment to voice their concerns.
The meeting lasted from 8 p.m.
until 3:30 a.m., when the board,
chaired by Mac Wilkerson, a
businessman who runs Leg-
gett’s, overruled the decisions
of Stark and Jay and reinstated
Pyles.to his duties.

 

**T heard

nice things
about him...

but

shortly thereafter

problems arose.”

 

However, during that hear-
ing, Stark was never called to
testify before the board. “And
that,”’ says Darrell, ‘‘is a ques-
tion I and a lot of people would
like answered.”’

The Committee for Joint Con-
trol of Lexington High School is

Shortly after being re-
instated, Pyles said he planned
to resign immediately after the
last football game Nov. 4. Since
that time, however, Pyles
seems to have changed his
mind. He has distributed a list
of demands that will have to be
complied with if he is to stay.
Some of the demands include
the termination of some peo-
ple’s jobs. In addition, he wants
to answer only to the County
Superintendent.

Pyles’ supporters have sug-
gested that Stark be removed as
principal of Lexington High.
This proposition has upset the
teachers at the high school,
because in the words of Darrell,
many feel “‘Stark’s a hell of a
good man.”’

The current situation offers
many questions. What exactly
did Pyles do to his players?
Why was his suspension over-
ruled without regard to the
testimony of the school prin-
cipal? Why is he presenting a
list of demands so that he is
answerable only to the county
superintendent? Is _ football
more important than the
smooth running of a school and
its academics?

ject originally scheduled for

Werner’s fifth shutout gives soccer 8-5 mark

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee soc-
cer team finished the season on
a winning note Saturday on
Wilson Field with a 2-0 victory
over Emory University of
Atlanta, giving the Generals an
8-5 final record.

The shutout victory was the
fifth of the season for junior
goalie Jay Werner, a transfer
student from St. Louis Universi-
ty.

Werner will return next
season with his entire defense
intact, as the Generals lose only
two seniors to graduation, for-
ward Roland Simon and mid-
fielder Ted Petrides, both four-
year lettermen.

“I don’t know if you ever get a

 

guy like Roland,’”’ commented
head coach Rolf Piranian.
“Both losing Roland and Teddy
will be a great loss. We’ve
got some holes to fill.’

Simon finished his soccer
career at W&L with 23 goals and
12 assists, putting him second
on the all-time assist list here,
despite being hampered by in-
jury much of last year.

“Among others, I’d be most
disappointed if Roland doesn’t
at least make All-South this
year,’’ said Piranian. ‘‘I say ‘at
least’ because I think he’s an
All-American.”

Against Emory, Simon’s shot
with five minutes left led to Eric
Obeck’s first goal of the season
when the Eagle goalie
mishandled the ball, sealing the
2-0 victory. Earlier Gary

Clements notched his third goal
of the season off an assist by
Mark Sullivan.

“T think it was a great year
for us,’”’ noted Piranian, whose
eight-year record at W&L now
stands at 46-58-6. ‘‘We lost six
players to graduation from last

year and we almost had as good
a season.”” W&L was 8-3-2 last
year.

The team voted the co-
captains for next year to be
junior Rob Coleman, co-captain
along with Simon this season,
and sophomore Billy Holmes,
who finished the season with
seven assists, tying a school
record, and five goals.

Piranian cited the 2-1 upset
victory over Messiah, ranked
fourth in the nation in Division
III at the time, as one of the

victory over Emory University on Saturday. The four-year letterman finished his career with 23 goals

high points of the season. ‘They
haven’t lost a game since we
beat them,”’ said Piranian.

The Generals’ 8-5 record
almost earned them a bid to the
NCAA Division III playoffs. ‘“‘If
we had not lost that Radford
game we would have been se-
lected,” said Piranian. W&L
lost to Division II Radford, 3-2,
in overtime on Nov. 1, after
holding a 2-1 lead going into the
final two minutes of the game.

Although he considers the
season a success, Piranian has
one lament as coach. “‘Of all the
fine things we’ve done, we’ve
never won the conference since
I’ve been here.”’

The 1974 W&L graduate noted
one of the reasons for the lack of
success in the conference is the
need to schedule conference

games during midweek, to re-
duce travel on school days. Of
the six midweek games this
season, three were conference
matches and four were defeats.
Four of the Generals’ five
defeats and 13 of the 16 goals
scored against them came from
Tuesday or Wednesday games,
when players take the field as
little as an hour after sitting ina
classroom.

“That’s been a problem ever
since I’ve been coaching here,”
said Piranian. “I’ve _ tried
everything,” including having
the school psychologist try to
help the team make the transi-
tion from school work to soccer.

“When a lot of other schools
have a game on a school day,
they just blow off classes that
day” added Piranian.

Look Billie Jean, men and

athletic field and_ the

equal competition. No, Billie
Jean, to equate men and women
on the athletic field is to deny

EC rules

on drugs
Says dealing

is dishonorable

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

Drug dealing may be con-
sidered dishonorable and thus
an honor violation, the Ex-
ecutive Committee decided
Monday night after a_ brief
debate.

The EC also decided no longer
to require law students to sign
honor cards in order to vote in
EC elections and expressed an
interest in the possibility of
again having house mothers for
fraternities.

The EC’s action regarding
drug dealing reversed its state-
ment last year that declared
that drug dealing did not fall
under the honor system.

“T think drug use shouldn’t
fall under us,’’ freshman rep
Andrew Caruthers said. ‘‘But
drug trafficking, where some-
one is out to make a buck, is
dishonorable and
disreputable.” .

Caruthers motion was ap-
proved unanimously by the EC.

Sophomore rep James White
established a distinction bet-
ween dealing in drugs and
merely using drugs. ‘“‘People
who get caught up in it, rather
than pushers, need to be
helped,’’ he said.

The only other point of debate
centered around at which point
in the judicial process the EC
should begin to consider drug
dealing an honor violation.

EC President Bob Jenevein
said, ‘‘I hesitate to agree to wait
until the law has caught up with
somebody before we do.”’ The
EC decided to treat drug deal-
ing as any other honor violation
that would be reported by fellow
students or faculty members.

Parents hear Wilson

Wastes no time on issue of coeducation

By G. BRUCE POTTER

Acknowledging that he was
the catalyst of the coeducation
issue, Washington and Lee
University President John D.
Wilson outlined the debate over
whether the school should ac-
cept women at the undergradu-
ate level during his report to the
parents Saturday morning.

Wilson’s Lee Chapel address
was the highlight of last week-

end’s 29th annual Parents’
Weekend.
“Bob Huntley (president

before Wilson) warned me that
the issue of coeducation would
arise,”’ Wilson said. ‘‘But I was
a little taken aback that it arose
so quickly.

SAC votes to

reinstate Fiji

Selfimprovement plan initiated

By JOHN CLEGHORN
Chief Editor

After losing its University

~ recognition: three weeks ago

because of accumulated in-
cidents of misconduct, the
Washington and Lee chapter of
Phi Gamma Delta regained its
recognition Monday when the
Student Affairs Committee
voted unanimously to reinstate
the fraternity based on a pro-
mise of an extensive Fiji-
designed self-improvement
plan.

The Monday meeting was the
result of an appeal request by
Phi Gamma Delta after SAC
voted to rescind University
recognition of the fraternity in
the wake of an incident involv-
ing the Hampden-Sydney Col-
lege mascot.

At the Monday meeting, Fiji
presented a proposal which was
designed largely by represen-
tatives of the International of-
fice of Phi Gamma Delta, ac-
cording to Dean of Students and
SAC Chairman Lewis G. John.

The proposal specifies that all
of the current members of the
fraternity are suspended and
each must be interviewed by
members of the International
office before they are readmit-
ted to the fraternity, Dean John
said.

Phi Gamma Delta Interna-
tional will name a Board of Con-
trol which will be made up of
W&L Fiji alumni and Interna-
tional representatives who will
establish a set of minimum
standards which the fraternity
must meet, Dean John said.

“They (the Board of Control)
are really taking over,’’ said
Dean John. ‘‘They are not just
supervising.”’

Dean John said that the cur-
rent members of the fraternity
will be interviewed immediate-
ly following the Thanksgiving
holiday and an alumni advisor
to the fraternity will move into
the house as soon as possible.

“The plan is to have a newly
reorganized chapter by the end
of the term,’’ he said, ‘‘so that
those who are reaccepted will
have to agree to a very specific
standard of conduct.”

“‘T think the SAC did the right
thing,’’ said Dick Sessoms,
director of alumni programs
and Phi Gamma Delta faculty
advisor, after the SAC decision.

“T think that the University
and all those involved acted
responsibly,” he said. ‘‘I would
have been disappointed if they
had not given the fraternity a
chance.”

Although Sessoms responded
optimistically to the SAC deci-
sion, he noted that the future of
the fraternity is still uncertain.
He said that in the upcoming in-
terviews, the suspended mem-
bers of the fraternity will face
‘ta tough board of control.”

“‘T think it is clear that not all
will make it,’”’ he said. ‘‘They
are going to have to commit to
responsibility.”

‘In the future we will impress
upon the members one rule,”’ he

continued, ‘“‘the rule of the
gentleman. That’s the one
thing.”’

“This shows that Fiji is not as
bad as everyone says it is,”’ said
Mark McDonough, a Fiji sopho-
more. ‘‘In this matter we show-
ed that we are willing to
cooperate with the administra-
tion.”’

“We are still on campus. Phi
Gamma Delta is still around,”
McDonough said. ‘‘The alter-
native was nothing.”

Opinion

 

Wilson’s speech
raises questions

by JOHN CLEGHORN
Chief Editor

Coeducation. Coeducation.
Coeducation. Coeducation.
Many of us are on the verge of
becoming sick of the issue. It
pervades our classrooms, our
dinner table discussions and
even our parties. While we
sometimes want to shy away
from the matter, it is crucial
that we do not. Because of its
monumental effect on our uni-
versity, it is necessary that we
remain constantly in touch with
any stimuli in connection with
the subject.

Another opportunity to widen
our knowledge on the matter
arose this past weekend when
President John D. Wilson gave
the traditional report to the
parents in Lee Chapel Saturday
morning. In this most impor-
tant appearance before the
parents, it would have been
easy for President Wilson to
skirt the issue which no doubt
must be taking the same toll on
him as each of us. But in his
respectable never-waning
thought process, President
Wilson dove headfirst into the
issue. And in his aggressive ad-
dress of coeducation President
Wilson, in a very subtle but un-
mistakeable manner, displayed
some very pro-coeducation sen-
timents.

Comment

 

One of the most interesting
points in the speech came in his
discussion of the role of General
Robert E. Lee in the develop-
ment of Washington and Lee. In
only a few weeks after coming
to Washington College, Presi-
dent Wilson told the parents,
Lee made some of the most
revolutionary changes in the
history of the college including
the replacement of the code of
the gentleman for the previous-
ly used conduct catalogue, the
institution of the strict liberal
arts curriculum and the beginn-
ing of the construction of Lee
Chapel. Upon hearing President
Wilson tell of Generals Lee’s
liberal but vastly effective
measures, one could not help
thinking that he might have

been strategically driving at a
point of similarity.

In the second portion of his
speech, President Wilson took
time to spell out for the parents
the pro and con arguments of
coeducation. In weighing the
pro argument, President Wilson
took great care to cite the
details of demographics and the
possibility that W&L might be
falling behind the social mores
of the outside world. In this seg-
ment of his explanation, Presi-
dent Wilson posed the question,
“Are we (W&L) only _tech-
nically single sex?’’ And in sup-
port of this rhetorical point he
cited the women at the law
school, the exchange students
and several foreign exchange
students who attended W&L last
year. The fact that these women
had already attended W&L,
President Wilson seemed to
suggest, proved that indeed
W&L is only technically single
sex.

A large part of his pro-
coeducation explanation con-
sisted of a letter he had receiv-
ed that morning from a faculty
member on the subject. In that
letter, from which President
Wilson read several para-
graphs, the faculty member ad-
vocated coeducation, stating
that if W&L does not go coed, it
would soon be ‘“‘isolated...into
ethnocentricity.”

In all fairness, President
Wilson did give time to the
argument against coeducation.
But the reasons he cited were
clearly not explained in an
equally articulate and exten-
sive manner and the time given
to them did not approach that
given to the pro-coeducation ex-
planation.

Three weeks ago President
Wilson told the Ring-tum Phi
that his mind on the matter is
not yet made up. While it is not
ours to attempt to question the
thoughts of such a clearly
brilliant man as President
Wilson, it is vital to remain
evercognizant and watchful of
his moves. His speech to the
parents, which was unques-
tionable key in the formulation
of their ideas about the matter,
certainly should have raised
many warning flags among
those in the audience.

Introspection is healthy Lex High
as questions swarm

by BEN HALE

Will we go coed? Will we
abolish spring term? Will we
abolish Washington’s break?
Will the fraternity system be
reorganized? Will sophomores
soon have to live on campus?
Will the size of the student body
increase?

Questions buzz around us like
bees these days and replies are
swarming too. These questions
are raising tempers, shocking
people, sending people out to
research, and causing intro-
spective debate and discussion
that has been missing for so
long it seems odd. This in-
trospection is good, though it
may be painful for those of us
who are happy as we are. This
is a pain, however, that ought to
be suffered. We ought to ex-
amine ourselves and our life-
style(s) because examination
leads to better understanding,
appreciation, and improvement
(if and where it is possible. )

We take for granted our all-
male tradition with its special
camaraderie, its honor system
grounded in its noblesse oblige
of gentlemen, its academic
freedom unhampered by sex
and role playing, etc. When the
question of coeducation is rais-
ed, especially by an outsider,
we are shaken out of our com-
placency. We are forced to
scrutinize this tradition that is
assumed and accepted. We are
forced to question ourselves and

our reasons for cherishing this
tradition. This look inward may
not change our sentiments. In-
deed, in a thoughtful communi-
ty such as ours we probably had
sound reasons for clinging to
this tradition anyway. But be-
ing forced to formulate and ar-
ticulate (as well as doubt) these
reasons is a healthy exercise.

My View

 

 

(And there may be some views
that do change.)

This need for introspection
goes farther than the single-sex
We also take for granted our
celebrated Spring term, our
open living arrangements, our
strong fraternity system, and
endless other aspects of W&L
life that fit smoothly and
pleasantly into our groove.
Perhaps a little shaking of the
tree is in order. We ought to be
explicitly aware of our way of
life and to be able to explain it
and defend it to ourselves (as
well as the outside world). If
our unique lifestyle is as social-
ly and intellectually fertile as
most of us believe it to be, then
these annoying questions are
helpful because they may jolt us
to understand why it is so good
(or why not, if that be the case).
It is not in the W&L tradition of
sound thought and action to lead
an unexamined life.

Lexington businesses prosper

Parents’ Weekend income bolsters profits

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

Although many area
businesses, restaurants and
hotels have reported higher
than normal sales on Washing-
ton and Lee’s 29th Annual
Parents’ Weekend, the late date
of this year’s parents’ weekend
may have cut into some local
merchants’ profits.

Hotels and motels do espe-
cially well on this weekend.
‘‘We were completely booked.
Most of our weekends are fully
booked. We are completely
booked for next years’
(Parents’) weekend,” said Don
Fredenburg of the 23-room
Alexander-Withrow House.

“It (Parents’ Weekend) does
have an impact on us here at
Natural Bridge,’’ said Winston
B. Tolley, general manager of
the Natural Bridge Hotel. But
Tolley also added that other
events such as the Virginia
Military Institute football game
and _ activities at Southern
Seminary Junior College also

increased business.
“Forty to 45 percent were
(W&L) parents.”

Other managers agreed with
Tolley that it was hard to judge
the percentage of W&L parents

‘due to other area activities.

Keydet-General Motel Manager
Maxine Holland said, “‘All the
weekends up to Parents Week-
end are good.’’ Miss Holland
already has 14 people on a
waiting list for next year at the
56-room hotel.

Connie Terry of Barnes Motel
felt that graduation weekend
probably resulted in a larger
turnout, but she said all of her
40 rooms were full this
weekend. Only when Barnes
Motel fills up do the managers
open the nearby Buena Vista
Motel, which was also full. Miss
Terry said that the 18-room
Buena Vista Motel is only open-
ed 10-15 times a year. The local
Econo Lodge was also filled up,
and expects to book all 48 rooms
for next year’s Parents’ Week-
end by February, according to
new managers Joan and Jack

 

EC

(continued from page 1)

After two weeks of what Jene-
vein described as ‘‘ruffling
feathers”’ of the law school, the
EC voted unanimously Monday
night not to require law stu-
dents to sign honor cards in
order to vote in EC elections.

“T’ve been assured that more
honor cards will be returned if
we don’t make this a require-
ment for the voting registration
list,” Jenevein said.

Vice-president Dave Judge
expressed the same opinion. “I
think we’ll get more cards, and
that’s the main purpose,’ he
said.

In supporting upperclass law
rep Jim Green’s motion not to
require signing of the cards for
voting in elections, Jenevein
also cited constitutional pro-
blems.

The question of house
mothers arose during the ODK
Symposium on community-uni-
versity relations last Wednes-
day, according to Jenevein.

Other questions raised were
the effectiveness of the honor
system and the disregard for
the speaking tradition and the
dress code.

“It was believed that we’ve
slipped a lot in a lot of different
ways,” Jenevein said. Although
sudden changes may not be wel-
come, he added, “‘It was sug-
gested that maybe they should
be forced until they’re
welcome.”’

An Assimilation Committee
at Washington and Lee used to
fine students for not speaking to
others on'‘campus or for walking
on the grass, Jenevein said.

“The students took pride in
that,’”’ he added. ‘‘They found

themselves on a higher plane
—above the Wahoos of UVa.

Jenevein also described
house mothers as ‘‘nothing but
a positive thing.”’

The EC unanimously approv-
ed junior rep Darby Brower’s
motion to recommend that the
Interfraternity Council  in-
vestigate the possibility of
reinstating house mothers.

In other action, the EC heard
budget reports from the Student
Activities Board and the Film
Society.

Andy Cooney reported that
the SAB is doing ‘‘better than
last year,” although ‘“‘Saturday
night bands (in the Cockpit)
have pretty much killed us.”’

No revenues were reported
for the SAB’s two Saturday
night bands — the Phonecops
and Public Service.

The SAB lost $21 on the White
Animals Oct. 11 because of what
Cooney described as ‘‘a lack of
communication.”

The band was to receive 85
percent of the receipts, minus
the $90 deposit already paid to
it. However, the person calcu-
lating the receipts that evening
did not figure in that deposit
and the band was thus overpaid
by about $100.

“It’s kind of hard to go up (to
the group) and say, ‘We did
this. Can you give us our money
back?’ ” Cooney said.

Both the films and the Fall
Weekend have done well finan-
cially, Cooney said, adding that
the continuation of Fall Week-
end would depend upon the
scheduling of Homecoming.

Cooney also said a weekend
was being worked out for Janu-
ary between the SAB and the
lacrosse team that would

Howard.

Restaurants and businesses
also noted increases. Spanky’s
Assistant Manager Jayne Plog-
ger noted approximately a 50
percent increase.

Connie Hostetter of the Palms
said, “Business goes up 70 to 75
percent. Parents’ weekend is
really the biggest (weekend of
the year).”’

Howard Johnson’s Emory
Smith feels that business went
up five to ten percent, but ‘‘it’s
been hard to figure the last two
years.” ,

Even movie attendance was
up for the weekend. According
to Lyric Theatre Manager Dale
Tomlin, attendance increases,
“whenever we have a big
event.”’ He estimated a 50 per-
cent increase in business for
last weekend. ‘It was the best
one of the year” for Alvin-
Dennis (apparrel shop) said
owner Alvin Carter of last
weekend. His reductions entic-
ed people to shop, and
“business goes up  con-
siderably.”

 

 

EC proposes referendum

on new grade scale

Following the initiative of
sophomore EC rep Darby
Brower and a W&L senior, the
Executive Committee decided
Monday to schedule a school-
wide referendum vote on the
new plus-or-minus. grading
scale for the week following
Thanksgiving vacation.

In the Oct. 31 EC meeting,
Brower brought to the floor a
suggestion from senior Parker
Schenecker that the new grade
scale should only affect the
freshman class as that was the

Brower said he suggested to
the EC that a referendum vote
be held and that the results then
be taken to the faculty.

Although the faculty voted in
the spring of 1982 to adopt the
new grade scale to become ef-

fective this fall, some members:

of the EC maintain that the
faculty should reconsider press-
ing the new scale on the upper
three classes.

“It’s certainly a school-wide
issue,’’ said EC President Bob

Jenevein. ‘The Executive Com-
mittee foresees a request that
the faculty postpone application
of that policy on the three upper
classes for as long as those
three upper classes are here.”’

“If I didn’t think that the stu-
dent sentiment would be
against this, I wouldn’t think
that there would be any reason
to take a poll,’’ Jenevein said.
“IT hope that there is faculty
sympathy for what the students
think.”

 

“It’s certainly

The faculty has one last

first applied.

Report to parents

(continued from page 1)

Wilson briefly outlined the
pros and cons of coeducation for
the parents and explained that
he hopes that a final decision on
the issue can be made by May.

“It was a question of whether
or not we are truly talking about
an all-male experience or a
male-female experience of a
very special sort,’’ Wilson said.

Wilson emphasized the point
that society has shifted since
W&L’s founding in the 18th cen-
tury so that women now ‘“‘par-
ticipate in the shaping of socie-
ty.”

Claiming that Washington
and Lee has become isolated

from an important part of the
educational culture, Wilson said
coeducation may be “‘the only
sensible way to protect our
selectivity.”

Wilson called the decision he
must make regarding his rec-
ommendation to the Board of
Trustees ‘‘a wonderfully
frightening obligation, but it’s
one that I truly relish.”

He added, though, that
“‘there’s something going on in
the W&L experience — it may
not be gender-fixed, but it
may,’ and for that reason
“we're going to study it
(coeducation) as carefully and

tion aside for yay or nay,”’ he
added.

‘“‘We must ask, ‘How can we

Wilson also reported to the
parents on the problems with
the fraternities and the process
by which they were being solv-
ed and repeated his goal of hav-
ing more on-campus housing.

In his opening remarks,
Wilson talked about the many
changes Robert E. Lee made as
president of the school only five
months after the end of the Civil
War. These included making
chapel attendance voluntary,
no longer requiring the classi-
cal curriculum and establishing
the new code of student regula-
tions by which W&L students
abide today.

“These changes were not
evolutionary, but revolu-
tionary,” Wilsonsaid. _

tivities included meetings with
faculty members, open houses
in many departments on cam-
pus, a Glee Club concert, a

CIA worse than KGB

Stockwell criticizes US world image

John Stockwell, the highest-
ranking Central Intelligence
Agency case officer to criticize
the agency’s policies publicly,
told a Washington and Lee Uni-
versity audience last Thursday
that the United States is seen
throughout the world ‘‘as just as
dangerous and dirty as the KGB
and the Russians ever were”
because of the CIA’s covert
operations throughout the
world.

Stockwell spoke as part of

Farrar to be released

First Lt. Syd Farrar, the 1980
W&L graduate injured in the
Grenada invasion, said Wednes-
day that he is ‘feeling real
well” and expects to be releas-
ed from Walter Reed Hospital

and transfered to Fort Stewart,
Ga., where he will stay for a few
days before being released in
time for Thanksgiving holiday.
“l’m walking around and

feeling real good,’ Farrar said
from his hospital room. “I’ve
got about six pins in my arm
and my chest has healed up
nicely.”

Farrar added that he was
pleased to receive the game ball
from the Washington and Lee-
Catholic University football

game.
“I’m mighty proud of that,”’
he said.

Contact ’84, the university’s
speaker symposium sponsored
jointly by the Interfraternity
Council and the student body.

A former chief of the CIA’s
Angolan task force, Stockwell
left the agency in 1977 and has
since written a book entitled ‘‘In
Search of Enemies” in which he
is highly critical of CIA policies.

The CIA, Stockwell charged
in his speech, has been directly
responsible for the deaths of 1
million people and ‘‘two million
more in the Vietnam War and
then the starvation in Cambodia
and killing there.”’

“The survivors know that
these people were killed by the
CIA and they do not love Ameri-
ca and Americans for it,’’ said
Stockwell, referring to various
operations in Africa, Asia, and
Central America.

‘“‘Now after 35 years of this, if
we had great credibility in 1945
in comparison with the Rus-
sions, we don’t now. The world
sees us as being just as
dangerous and dirty as the KGB
and the Russians ever were,”
Stockwell said.

Stockwell charged in his lec-
ture that the CIA and the Na-
tional Security Council routine-
ly lie to the American people
about their operations abroad.

“T saw lies at every level of
the program,” Stockwell said.
“Truth has no applicability to
the covert activities of the CIA
or the operations of the United
States in places like Grenada.”

Stockwell said that secrecy in
such covert activities is not a
matter of protecting the opera-
tion but is ‘‘designed to keep the
American people from knowing
what is happening..,’

Further, Stockwell contended
that the Reagan administration
“wants to lead us into another
war.

“It’s madness. The world is
like the hull of an ancient
wooden ship that is filled with
explosives, and the United
States is in the business of play-
ing with matches,” Stockwell
said.

‘Rashomon’ closes its run with success

But much of the behind-the-scenes work is never seen

sively by Martinez from the
beginning of October to the
opening night of the play for
their fight.

Martinez forged the swords
used in the play out of steel by
the middle of October. Before
that, Cartmill and Richardson
used sticks.

While all this was going on,
Tom Ziegler’s Drama 131 class
was working on the costumes,
publicity, set building, and the
building of props for the play.
Each student put in roughly:
four hours of work a week to
keep up with the progression of
the play.

The set has been struck at
Washington and Lee’s Trouba-

been swept up and the costumes
have been stored.

For six nights the stage of the
W&L theatre took the form of a
Japanese field around 900 A.D.

What people who attended the
play didn’t see was the many
hours spent to ‘make sure the
finished product would meet the
public’s expectations.

Originally, the department’s
fall production was supposed to
be “A Funny Thing Happen-
ed on the Way to the Forum.”’

Martinez had the problem of
replacing three cast members
throughout the course of the
play. Fortunately, there was on-
ly one major character replac-
ed, and that was done by the end
of September.

‘‘Rashomon’’ features a
scene in which two characters
engage in a sword battle. This is

Most of the class were required
to attend the ‘‘dry-tech”’ rehear-

“intense perfectionist,’ said
the first show was “‘okay,” but
added that the cast was “‘dis-

The show was not without its
faults, however. During the
opening night performance

New movie offers little more

By CHARLIE ALCORN
Special to the Phi

The new James Bond movie is
on the streets and ready for lus-
ty viewing by all you minks out
there suffering from early
winter blues. Never Say Never
Again is a fun movie, but it could
be dangerous to anybody with
an I.Q. over 90. Who cares if it
has the most asinine plodding
screenplay in the history of
film? What it does have is the
real Bond, Sean Connery, for
the first time since he abdicated
the title after Diamonds Are
Forever (1971) and enough skin
(we're talking all-world) and
stunts to keep any red blooded

Burdette Trio is well

By CHRISTOPHER DEIGHAN
Special to the Phi

A receptive crowd welcomed
a musical trio in Lee Chapel this
past Monday evening as the
Washington and Lee Concert
Guild began its series of four
performances.

The Burdette Trio, a group of
superior artists: violinist David
Kim, pianist Jungeun Kim and
cellist Robert Cafaro, perform-
ed three sensational works by
Ludwing van Beethoven,
Ernest Bloch and Johannes
Brahms.

Beethoven’s “Trio in E-flat
Major, Opus 1, No. 1’’ carried
the audience through a transi-
tion of bright movement to gen-
tle sorrow and then to a finale of

climactic excitement.
The musicians’ expression

about the direction this movie is
going to take. The women are
above average even for a Bond
flick. Fatima Blush (Barbara
Carrera) gives new meaning to
the word wedgie in one scene.
And the All-American blonde
Domino (Kim Bassinger) is
spectacular. My favorite scene
involves Domino being sold into
slavery by a fat bedouin from
the Sudan and Bond sweeping
her away on horseback and
leaping off a 100-foot wall —
horse and all. Heck yea! If
you’re going to be mindless at
least have a great imagination.
This kind of scene is typical of
the whole movie, which I
suspect won’t be in line for an
Academy Award (perhaps a

tion and fascinating syncopa-

talent and sense of unity of
sound.

The contemporary style of
Bloch’s “Three Nocturnes’’
refreshed the classical style of
Beethoven and earned the trio
an explosion of applause as the
first half of the program con-
cluded. Three times the group
was called back to receive the
audience’s praise.

Following the intermission,
the three musicians performed
Brahms’ “Trio in B Major,
Opus 8,’’ impressing upon the
listeners feelings of calm har-
mony which suddenly devel-
oped into raging excitement.
The violin, piano and cello ef-
fectively played off one

Weekend.

After the show, the actors
removed their costumes and
their make up, which they had
applied themselves nightly.
They were finished with the
show. But for Ziegler’s 131
class, one painstaking day was
left: the day the set was torn
down, known as ‘“‘striking the
set.”” Packaging the costumes
that were rented, tearing down
the set that was scarcely three
weeks old, and carrying the
many props across the street to

the Boiler Room Theatre and

the storage area next to it are

_ all involved in the day-long pro-

cess.

For Martinez and the actors,
they have a feeling of ac-
complishment for the play,
which gained approval from
most of the people who attend-
ed. For Drama 131 students,
they hope to gain the ‘‘A” that
comes with all the monotonous
work and recent nights spent in

ominous as in other Bond ven-
tures and the special effects are
not quite as futuristic as was ex-
pected (ie. you might find
some of the gadgets in a
Sharper Image catalogue). Also
the title song is not the usual top
40 smash of recent Bond flicks.

What makes this film is Con-
nery, who is the undisputable
Bond in my book. He is graying
at the temples and not quite as
stout, but there is no question
when he beds Fatima Blush or
beats up a possessed shark that

Generals thrash Dutchmen, 41-15

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
Generals finished the 1983
season Saturday with a 41-15
thrashing of the Lebanon Valley
“Flying Dutchmen.” The vic-
tory, which gave the Generals a
final record of 6-3, secured W&L
a second-place tie in the ODAC
with Randolph-Macon and
Emory and Henry behind con-
ference champion Hampden-
Sydney.

Saturday’s win also included
two’ milestones for record-
setting tailback Gene Girard.
Girard, who gained 157 yards on
28 rushes, established a new
W&L single-season rushing
mark during the first half
against Lebanon Valley. He
also became the first General
player to pass 1,000 yards
rushing in a season since the
end of subsidized athletics at
W&L in 1953. Girard totaled
1,011 yards on 209 carries in
1983.

The Generals got off to a
shaky start against Lebanon
Valley, spotting the Flying
Dutchmen an early 7-0 lead.
After receiving the opening
kick-off, Lebanon Valley drove
for a touchdown, scoring on a
six-yard pass from James
Algeo to Bob Kransley less than
six minutes into the game.

The Generals suffered
another setback only minutes
later when quarterback Bobby
Wilson went down with an in-
jured knee on their fifth offen-
sive play. However, on the next
play, Girard took a hand-off
from Wilson’s replacement,
freshman Jon Thornton, and
raced 72 yards for a touchdown
with 6:51 remaining in the first
quarter. James White added the
first of his five extra points on
the day, tying the score at 7-7.

Girard scored three more
times all on short runs, before
intermission, and the Generals
coasted to a comfortable 28-7
half-time lead.

Late in the third quarter,

senior defensive end Charlie
Alcorn recovered a_ blocked
punt in the end zone, increasing

the Generals’ lead to 34-7.
Freshman Kevin Weaver
scored the last General touch-

down on a one-yard run with
10:19 remaining in the game,
making the score 41-7.

Lebanon Valley scored a late
touchdown on quarterback
James Algeo’s three-yard pass
to Jim Reilly. Algeo also passed
for the two-point conversion,
making the final score 41-15.

Head coach Gary Fallon had
nothing but praise for his
team’s performance during the
1983 season, particularly that of
his seniors and Girard.

“‘T couldn’t be happier for the
seniors on this football team
that they could go through four
years here and be winners all
the way through,” Fallon said.
“In fact, the way this progress-
ed, [’m really sorry to see it
end.”’

Fallon also lauded the perfor-
mance of Girard.

“Gene worked hard for
everything he got this year. He
came back to school on August
9, ahead of everyone else, just
to get himself in shape. You
couldn’t ask for a better team
player,” stated Fallon. “Of
course, Gene’s record is also a
tribute to the steady play of our
offensive line, to the blocking of
fullback Frank Surface, and to
the blocking of our wide re-
ceivers. Everyone shares in
that achievement.”’

Fallon would take none of the
credit for the successful season
himself as he gave it all to his
staff.

‘‘My hat is off to our coaching
staff,’ said Fallon. ‘‘When we
started this season, there were
plenty of question marks. But
the coaches got our players to
perform at their highest level.
The record is a credit to the
staff.”’

Fallon is not about to relax
after his team’s performance in
1983. He is already planning for
the next season.

‘‘We had some young players
who really grew up in a hurry
this season,’ Fallon _ said.
‘“‘There are some obvious holes
that we’ll have to plug up be-
tween now and next fall, but I
think everyone connected with
the program is already looking
forward to next season.”

 

Generals set

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The 1983 Washington and Lee
football team was a record-
setting one as six school marks
were broken during the season.

Gene Girard was responsible
for four of these by establishing
single-season highs in rushing
and scoring. Girard, a junior
from Coral Gables, Fla., rushed
for 1,011 yards during the
season, surpassing the record of
928 yards set by Stewart Atkin-

son in 1979.

He also broke three scoring
records for rushing touch-
downs, total touchdowns and
total points, by scoring 15 touch-
downs, 14 of which came on the
ground, and one two-point con-
version for 92 total points. In ad-

 

six records

dition, Girard was the first
1,000-yard rusher since W&L
eliminated subsidized athletics
in 1953.

James White also placed his
name in the W&L record books
by setting a new single-season
mark for successful point-after-
touchdown conversions. White
was good on 29 PATs, six more
than the 1981 record of 23 held
by Bill Devine.

The last record set in 1983
belongs to freshman Kevin
Weaver. Against , Maryville,
Weaver returned the opening
kick-off 100 yards for a touch-
down, breaking the record of 93
yards established in 1979 by
Chris Leiser. Weaver was the
second. leading rusher for the
Generals in 1983, totalling 376
yards on 68 carries.

Frosh to lead swimmers

With high hopes for a suc-
cessful season, Washington and
Lee’s swimming team will open
its 1983-84 season with a pair of
dual meets this week.

The Generals swam against
VMI in Cy Twombly Pool at 7
p.m. Wednesday. Then on Fri-
day W&L will compete against
Johns Hopkins while the Sweet
Briar College team will swim

against Johns Hopkins’
women’s team. That meet also
begins at 7 p.m.

‘“‘We’re jumping right into the
thick of things at the outset,”’
said W&L head aquatics coach
Page Remillard. ‘‘One of the

biggest questions facing us in-

volves ‘a number of very tal- .

ented freshmen. Until we get in-
to our season, we really won’t
know how they will make the
transition from high school to
college although we’re very en-
couraged by the practices.”’

The Generals will return All-
America performer Gary
Meyer, a senior who specializes
in the freestyle sprint events
and finished 11th in the national
competition in the 100-yard
freestyle last year.

Also returning is sophomore
John Moody who qualified for

the national meet last year in

the butterfly.
Some of the promising
newcomers include Bryan

Chaffe and divers Joe Donovan
and Matt DiVito as well as three
freshmen who also competed in
water polo — Jim Savage of
North Tonawanda, N.Y., Dan
Trice of Tuscaloosa, Ala., and
Jay ReVille of Raleigh, N.C.

Following Friday’s dual meet
with Johns Hopkins, the Gener-
als will be competing in the
W&L Senior Invitational on
Saturday and Sunday, also at
Twombly Pool.

Polo drops two at Easterns;
finishes season at 25-12

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
water polo team captured one
victory against two losses to
finished seventh in the NCAA
Division I Eastern Water Polo
Championships, held last
weekend at the U.S. Naval
Academy. The Generals de-
feated the University of
Massachusetts, and lost to Slip-
pery Rock and _ Richmond.
W&L’s 1-2 performance last
weekend gives them a final
season record of 25-12.

According to Assistant Water
Polo Coach Bob Newcomb, Tim
Rock and Bobby Pearson
played exceptionally well for
the Generals last weekend.
Rock scored five goals and
Pearson scored six during the
weekend.

The Generals dropped their
first game of the tournament to
third seeded Slippery Rock, 10-
6. Although the game was even
after the first quarter, Slippery
Rock possessed a 6-4 lead at

‘halftime. According to Coach

Newcomb, “Slippery Rock con-
trolled the entire game.”
Newcomb said, ‘‘They (Slip-
pery Rock) were on this week-
end. To lose to a team like that
when they are playing that well
is not bad.”’

Slippery Rock upset second-
seeded Navy 16-10, in the semi-
finals. The victory placed Slip-
pery Rock in the finals against
Brown and gave them a berth in
the national water polo tourna-
ment.

The Generals lost a close
game against Richmond by a
score of 7-4 in W&L’s second
game. Richmond avenged their
loss to the Generals in the finals
of the Southern League Cham-
pionships, when they scored the
winning goal with 26 seconds re-
maining inthe game.

The Generals rebounded from
their two losses to earn a vic-
tory against the University of
Massachusetts. The Generals
won, 6-5.

“We were in control most of
the game, but we could never

break it open,’’ Newcomb said.
He added, ‘‘The Richmond
game took a lot out of us men-
tally. It was hard losing to them
for the fourth time (this
season).”’

Coach Newcomb believes that
the 1983 W&L water polo season
was a great success. ‘“‘We are
upset that we lost to Richmond
(at the Easterns) but we are
still very, very pleased with the
season and how it came out,’’ he
said.

According to Newcomb,
coaches and officials at the
Easterns last weekend noticed
and remarked on W&L’s im-
provement from the beginning
to the end of the season.

“It would have been really
nice to earn a berth to the Na-
tional tournament,’’ said
Newcomb. He concluded, how-
ever, ‘‘The main thing we were
looking for this season was what

_ we accomplished.”

The Generals’ accomplish-
ment: their third consecutive
Southern League Title.

Hoops begins with

Lip-Off Tourney

By BOB BRYANT
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
Generals will begin the 1983-84
basketball season when they
host three teams in the W&L
Tip-Off Tournament Friday and
Saturday in Warner Center.

The tournament will begin at
7 p.m. Friday when John Jay
College of New York City meets
Eastern College of St. David’s,
Pa. The 1983-84 basketball
Generals will make their debut
at 9 p.m. against the State
University of Old Westbury,
N.Y.

The winners of these two
games will meet in the cham-
pionship game Saturday at 9
p.m., which follows the consola-
tion game at 7 p.m. between the
two losing teams.

“Old Westbury finished with
a 19-2 mark a year ago and has
nine lettermen from that team
returning,’’ noted W&L Head
Coach Verne Canfield. ‘‘We ex-
pect them to be formidable to
say the least.”’

But, Canfield adds, his team
has “worked hard, and I think
we’re ready for an excellent ef-

fort in the tournament.”’

The Generals have lost three
of last year’s starters, who
helped the team finish with a
17-10 record. “‘We’ve still got
some adjustments to make,”
said Canfield, who expects to be
experimenting with his team’s
lineup in the tournament. ‘I
want to find the right chemistry
out there on the court.”

The two returning starters
this year are senior co-captains
John Lee Graves, a 6-foot-5 for-
ward, and Chris Baldwin, a 5-
foot-9 point guard. New to the
Starting lineup are juniors
Kevin McClatchy, a_ 6-foot
guard, and Scott Shannon, a 6-
foot-5 forward.

The fifth starter will be a
freshman forward, either Rob
Spencer (6-foot-4) or Keith
Brideweser (6-foot-6). Spencer
made Canfield’s decision easier
by turning his ankle in practice
last week. ‘‘His availability for
the tournament is uncertain,”
said the coach.

Sixth man Lex Fitzenhagen, a
6-foot-2 junior, will see plenty of
action at guard and/or forward,
Canfield added.

College presidents give W&L top ranking

By NELSON PATTERSON
Staff Reporter

A “‘U.S. News and World Report”’ survey
of college presidents placed Washington
and Lee as the most frequently cited

‘“‘smaller comprehensive university” east

of the Mississippi.

The survey of 662 college and university
presidents, published as the cover story in
the Nov. 28, 1983, issue, noted that
Washington and Lee distinguished itself by
its small size, scholarly atmosphere -and
wide range of course offerings.

In the survey, education editor Lucia
Solorzano and staff writer Barbara Quick

used classifications of institutions of
higher learning developed by the Carnegie
Council on Public studies in Higher Educa-
tion in sending out nine separate surveys
to 1,308 four-year college presidents. Each
president received a survey with a list of
schools in the same classification as
his/her respective college, and, where ap-
plicable, in the same geographic region.
W&L was named as one of the top tive
smaller comprehensive universities in the
country by 47.6 percent of the presidents, far
ahead of the second-place school east of the
Mississippi, Lafayette College (Pa.), which
received 28.6 percent of the votes.
“Presidents of national universities

were given lists of national universities
and were told to choose the top five.’’ Ms.
Quick said during an interview this week.

“Presidents of regional liberal arts col-
leges east of the Mississippi were given
lists of similar liberal arts colleges east of
the Mississippi and were told to choose the
best five colleges in that list or to add to
that list in a blank at the end of the
survey,’ she said.

Ms. Quick said some college presidents
were offended by the idea of rating them-
selves, but she noted that most responses
showed the presidents ‘‘tooting their own
horns.”’

The survey responses in the comprehen-

Sive university category cited W&L for its
keen adherence to a liberal-arts cur-
riculum while offering a wide range of pro-
fessional programs such as journalism
and business administration.

‘We found Washington and Lee was,
“* ‘a very strong place — at once scholarly
and collegial.’ as we quoted one man,”’
said Ms. Quick in reference to a quote in
the story by Harvard professor-emeritus
David Riesman.

Ms. Quick said the diverse responses
they received seemed to point to one con-
clusion — there is a school out there for
every prospective college student.

Open exam plans

postponed until winter

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

Time has run out on the open
exam policy — for this semes-
ter, at least.

The policy may still be ap-
proved in time for winter
semester exams, though, ac-
cording to Cole Dawson, junior
representative to the Executive
Committee, who headed up a
subcommittee to investigate
open exams.

Dawson reported at the EC’s
regular meeting Monday night
that he had not had time to draw
up a detailed proposal — one
that he said was warranted
—for Monday afternoon’s
meeting of the faculty Ex-
ecutive Committee.

In order for the open exam
policy to have been approved in
time for this semester’s exams,
the faculty EC would have had
to make a recommendation this
week in time for the entire
faculty to make a final decision
during the regular faculty
meeting Monday afternoon.

“There’s a lot of detail that
we really have to define,”’
Dawson said. ‘‘We have to work
out the logistics of each depart-

ment and exactly which secre-
taries will be on duty “‘

The open exam policy would
provide for students to sign up
only for a particular exam time,
rather than both time and date,
as is done now.

A student could then take the
exam any day during the exam
week at that time — either 9
a.m. or2 p.m.

Scott Mason, junior represen-
tative to the EC last year, had
initiated the investigation but
met with opposition from the
Commerce School. Mason, who
did not run for re-election,
reported to the EC on his find-
ing earlier this year.

“This really is an important
aspect of the future of - the
school, the honor system and
the exam policy,’’ Dawson said.

However, he said he had
wanted to be able to present the
faculty EC with a comprehen-
sive proposal.

“The faculty EC’s vote will
probably carry some weight
with the faculty. I have been
talking to several professors,
and if we can draft a good pro-
posal, they feel that we’ll be
able to get it through for next
semester,’’ he said.

83% against

plus/minus

for upper
classmen

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

An overwhelming majority of
students voting in yesterday’s
poll cast ballots against the
plus-minus system’s affecting
upperclassmen.

Of the 458 sophomores, jun-
iors and seniors who voted in
the poll, 379, 83 percent, voted
against the new grading system
affecting upperclassmen, 57, 12
percent, supported that system,
and 22, 5 percent, said they
were indifferent or undecided.

The plus-minus grading sys-
tem, which would enable pro-
fessors to grade students on a
scale that would add .33 grade
points to a grade for a plus and
subtract .33 for a minus, was
approved by the faculty in May
1982.

The faculty decided last year
that the system would affect up-
perclassmen as well as entering
freshmen.

The faculty committee on
courses and degrees voted
Tuesday not to recommend to
the entire faculty that the plus-

1eWw and Outlook
Not too late

While the referendum movement against the new
plus and minus grading system is a worthwhile one, it
has been said that it has come too late. When the
faculty voted to adopt the system in the spring of 1982,
the change was reported but little else was mentioned
of it. Not until this fall, when students realized that
they would be affected by the change, has concern
arisen about the system, which, some argue, is being
applied unfairly to the upper three undergraduate
classes which did not enter the university under such
a rule. As with other changes in the academic realm
such as the increased credit requirement, this new
policy should only affect the freshmen who will be
graded by it for four complete years.

Wednesday’s referendum, which showed that 83
percent of those who voted did not favor the imposi-
tion of the new grade scale on the upper three classes,
was a special opportunity for the students to voice
their opinions on the issues. It was a rare chance for
the faculty and the administration to discover the stu-
dent sentiment on a subject over which the students
have no control but are greatly affected. The Ex-
ecutive Committee is to be thanked for providing such
an opportunity.

Four hundred and fifty-eight of the sophomores,
juniors and seniors voted in Wednesday’s referen-
dum. That is roughly half of their number. At a school
which has become marked by its apathy and which
usually turns out at the polls in numbers closer to 20
or 30 percent, the high voter turn-out is significant. It
proves simply that this is an issue of great impor-
tance to the students who will be affected by it. And
for 83 percent of those students to vote against the
move is a fairly clear indication of where the stu-
dent’s opinions fall.

The faculty will meet Monday to decide whether
this new grade system will indeed be applied this fall.
Although the movement against the referendum
comes at the very last minute, a substantial impact
can still be made.

If students seek out their faculty advisers and their
professors, they can have their voices heard in Mon-
day’s meeting. This could further their involvement
ina matter which is otherwise out of their hands.

Although it could be too late to make an impact, it is ©

nevertheless vital that the students have their voices

‘Losing with class’

To the Editors:

During the weekend of
November 19 and 20, I attended
the games of the Washington
and Lee Tip-off Basketball
Tournament. A relatively inex-
perienced Washington and Lee
team lost two close games, and
thus Saturday night’s cham-
pionship game did not include
the Generals. The sparse crowd

at the championship only made
more conspicuous the absence
of the Washington and Lee
coach and players, presumably
the tournament hosts. After the

game, trophies were presented
to the first, second, and third
place teams, and to members of
the all-tournament' team.
Again, no members of our team

were there to congratulate the
winners. I believe this to have
been an embarrassment to
Washington and Lee.

Ina period of many suggested
changes for our institution and
much talk of tradition, let’s not
abandon the tradition of win-
ning — and losing — with class.

Bumper sticker is reactionary

To the Editors:

Recently -I saw a bumper
sticker avowing the predictable
sentiment ‘‘Better dead than
Co-ed.”” The slogan continued
and urged one to ‘‘preserve the
W&L tradition.”

I had alwavs believed that the
“W&L’ tradition’ was of
greater substance than the
mere issue of single-sex educa-
tion.

I had believed that W&L’s
traditions were rationality, in-
telligence and informed judg-
ments: all hallmarks of a fine
liberal arts education.

The reactionary sentiments
reflected by that bumper
sticker connote bigotry and
egoism, and many students in-
sinuate, through buzz words
and association with the univer-
sity, an unimpeachable authori-
ty to speak preemptively.

The coeducational issue will
be decided upon not by the stu-
dent or the alumni, but by
President Wilson and the board
of trustees. It will be resolved
not on the basis of emotions,
preference or sentiment, but
upon clear rational thought.

Academic, not social

To the Editors:

It has come to my attention
that a problem is arising con-
cerning the noise in the Univer-
sity Library. The issue was
originally raised by the Library
Advisory Committee, but I am
writing this letter from my own
experience. Studying in a dorm
room or fraternity house is
close to impossible if you have
serious work to do. The library
is the only place where many
people, myself included, can
study in peace. So if there are
too many distractions to work
even there, those of us who use
it as our sole place of study are

out of luck.

One of the biggest problems
with noise arises when groups
of friends sit together at tables
or adjoining carrels; especially
when a group of fraternity
members gather to study. This
is fine if they do so in a side
room. But when they gather in
the open part of the library they
can cause a great disturbance.
Don’t kid yourself. If you really
want to get something accom-
plished, study by yourself. This
is what carrels are meant for.
Then you can go elsewhere and

Perhaps those who are spur-

in the issue of coeducation
should take heed and refrain
from speaking to the issue until
they can do so in an informed
and intelligent manner, in the

true Washington and Lee tradi-

No clear advantages in semester system
Students should fight for this one

By Scott Mason

It’s as if John Wilson has lac-
ed up his boxing gloves and
stepped into the ring. He’s hurl-
ed blows at issues involving
fraternities and single-sex
education, and students, buckl-
ing under the force of his
onslaught, fear W&L’s future
may be on the ropes.

Wilson’s most recent target is
W&L’s six-week spring semes-
ter. Upon recommendation
from the committee on courses
and degrees, Wilson appointed
eight professors to determine if
the spring semester should be
dropped from the school’s
undergraduate calendar.

Professors have complained
that the six-week semester isn’t
enough time in which to teach
an entire course. The material
has to be crammed in, and
because teachers are rushed for
time, much of it isn’t gone over
as thoroughly as it should.

Besides that, most faculty see
spring term as a joke, a Six-
week vacation for students to
enjoy afternoons at Goshen and
late-night fraternity parties.
They see the course load as be-
ing too low and spring fever as
being too high.

Reader’s
Advocate

 

 

The six-week spring semester
follows a 12-week fall and 12-
week winter semester. The
newly-formed calendar com-
mittee is thinking about
dividing the 30-week school
year into two 15-week semes-
ters. That would get rid of the
six-week ‘‘vacation.”’

The committee is keeping its
options open. It has some viable
alternatives. The two 15-week

Who has the right?

Communism is a dirty word
in the United States. In recent
decades, we have even seen fit
to commit our men and re-
sources to resist the spread of
communism. For this, the com-
munists we oppose have called
us imperialists. Are they right?
Imperialism is generally defin-
ed as the practice or policy of
forming and maintaining an
empire by the conquest and/or
colonization of other lands. With
this as a working definition,
let’s draw a few comparisons.

My View

 

 

Why did countries have col-
onies? The various reasons can
be grouped in three categories.
The first used to be called the
‘‘white man’s burden.’’
Westerners saw those they col-
onized as morally inferior and
took upon themselves the task

of “enlightening” the natives.
' The second is mercantilism, the

use of colonies as sources of raw
materials and as markets for
finished goods. The third is
geopolitics, the hunger for more
absolute power and greater
strength in international strug-
gles.

Now then, let’s examine our
own foreign policy in terms of
the goals of colonialism. First of
all, we have postured ourselves
as the world’s moral leader, in-
sisting that the American
system should be the world’s
system. In countries such as

China and Vietnam, we have
supported leaders unpopular
among their own people but
loyal to the United States. We’re
doing that even now, most
notably in Central America.
Part of our concern with hostile
takeovers is a concern for loss
of strategic materials such as
petroleum, bauxite, rubber, as
well as for American business
interests whose markets in the
revolutionized nations would
disappear. Therein lies our
mercantilist motivation. Our
desire for military bases
abroad and our deployment of
missiles on foreign soil should

make our geopolitical motiva-
tions obvious. Although there
are differences, our foreign
policy does come disturbingly

. Close to the colonialist model.

International communism is a
threat to our ‘colonialist’

goals, and therefore we combat
it. That is, we oppose com-
munism because it opposes our
empire-building, not because
we have moral difficulties with
communism.

That makes U.S. foreign
policy seem awfully petty, and
many will fight the conclusion
Americans would like to think
that we oppose communism
because it runs counter to the
freedoms we cherish. Yet we
have supported unrepresen-
tative monarchies in Saudi
Arabia and Iran, military
governments such as that in
Guatemala, brutal dictator-
ships in nations like the Philip-
pines, state religion in Israel,
and racist governments like

semester system however isn’t
one of them.

Under this system, students
would be required to take at
least 15 credits per semester in-
stead of 12. The added course
would presumably mean added
work and an extra burden on
students to study.

Competition among students
is often intense. The com-
petitive student places a heavy
emphasis on class standing. It’s.
important that he make good
grades, but it’s essential that
his grades are better than the
next guy’s.

The heavier course load

under a two 15-week semester
system would seemingly make
it harder to get good grades in
all subjects. Students would
now have to put studying time
into a fifth course which before
they didn’t have to worry about.

Because grades are so impor-
tant to the competitive student,
he must somehow alleviate this
extra burden so that his

Communism vs. Colonialism

South Africa. Morality was
never an issue in our dealings
with those countries, yet we
have tried to characterize our
dealings with communists as
moral struggles.

So far this has been an article
with apparent leanings but no
real conclusion. In considering
the information and com-
parisons, what can be conclud-
ed? Perhaps that our nation’s
leaders have been misleading

the public as to the true motiva-
tions behind our foreign policy.
Perhaps they’ve been mis-
leading themselves. Whatever
the case, the lesson to be learn-
ed is that in order to have a con-
sistent and reasonable foreign
policy, we must be a little more
honest with ourselves. If we
want morality to be a foreign
policy issue, let’s demand that
morality equally from our
friends and our foes. If we wish
to maintain the status quo, then
we must stop characterizing
our clashes as moral struggles
and call them what they are:
simple struggles between op-
ponents, characterized not by
great moral questions but by
self-interest. Either way, a
more honest presentation of our
foreign policy aims will
stimulate more _ productive
discussion of our foreign policy
by our policy-makers and by the
public.

At a time when American
resources and American
soldiers are such active agents
of our foriegn policy, we need to
be a little more honest with
ourselves about what we’re do-
ing and why we're doing it.

chances of making all As are as ©

high as they were before the
fifth course was added.
Therefore, he may enroll in
“‘gut’’ courses where an A can
be gotten easily.

Gut courses don’t require a
lot of “‘intellectual stimula-
tion.’”’ The competitive student
is generally more apt to go for
the easy A.

The added work under the two

15-week semester system is
likely to drive students to gut
courses. Consequently, they
won’t be getting as much out of
their education. They’ll be
sacrificing good courses for
easy courses, intellectual
stimulation for an A earned
without having to think. When
that happens, it’s unfortunate
for students but also unfor-
tunate for the school which fails
in its responsibility of properly
educating those students.
Another drawback to the two
15-week semester system is that
it doesn’t provide for off-

campus studies. Internships
can be extremely valuable.
They give students a chance to
gain working experience in the
“real” world. The current six-

week semester is ideally suited
for that purpose.

Whether or not President
Wilson and the calendar com-
mittee decide to adopt the two
15-week semester system in
place of the six-week spring
semester, it’s a sure bet that
students will voice their opin-
ions loudly. They’ve suffered
unexpected blows by what they
see as attacks upon the fraterni-
ty system and single-sex educa-
tion. Now, the school calendar
is under siege. It’s time to fight
back. Another round has begun.

vocate, operates on a separated

Letter writers charge
Admissions Office

To the Editors:

The question at the heart of
the coeducation issue is the
following: Given projections of
a 22 percent decline in its pool of
applicants, can Washington and
Lee continue to attract a suffi-
cient number of high quality
students while remaining all-
male? Thus far, opponents of
coeducation have, to the extent
possible, tried to avoid this
question. We, therefore, take
this opportunity to respond
directly to the question of
whether W&L can survive with-
out coeducation.

After a detailed examination
of admissions statistics compil-
ed on the fifteen most recent
freshman classes, including the

numbers of applicants, the
numbers of students admitted,
and the numbers of students
enrolled, and of the responses to
questionnaires sent to all
students who are admitted, we
must answer this question with
a definite yes.

Consider, first, the admis-
sions picture in 1976, the last
time the Board of Trustees con-
sidered coeducation. The
number of applications had
dropped to around 1,300 from
slightly more than 1,400 in 1966.
While this figure was not static,
the yearly dips and rises had
tended to be small and to offset
each other. The Board conclud-
ed, wisely, that the number of

really enjoy yourself without
feeling guilty. If you can’t study
by yourself or you study better
with someone find a side room
where you can close the door
and study without disturbing
others. I realize that everyone
needs a break now and then just
to talk; but even this can be
done quietly, just whisper.

Another problem arises in
that underclassmen seem to be
afraid to ask upperclassmen to
be quiet. Everyone has the right
to use the library regardless of
class. It is the upperclassmen’s
responsibility to honor this
right. Last year all you had to
do was snap your fingers and
people would quiet down. There
is no reason why this cannot
continue.

This noise problem is really
serious. With exams coming up

people will start getting really
uptight, and a great many of
them will flock to the library.
This could be hell unless we are
all courteous and respectful of
others’ rights like the
gentlemen that we are supposed
to be. The administration is
really serious about this. There
has been talk about closing the
library at night. It has even
been suggested that monitors
be placed in the library. Come
on guys, we already have a
great deal of freedom in the
library. How many other
libraries do you know of that let .
you sleep in them and put your
feet up on the desks? Let’s not
jeopardize this freedom. We
simply need to be responsible
and monitor ourselves.

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

The Executive Committee
formed a subcommittee Mon-
day night to explore the
possibility of upperclassmen
serving as registration ad-
visers.

Citing a general student opin-
ion that some faculty advisers
do not offer much help in choos-
ing particular courses, senior
representative Jim Messer
said, ‘“‘but someone who could
devote a little more time during
registration.

“It might run into problems
with the faculty, though.”’

The EC discussed the possi-
bility of students in particular
majors helping other students
interested in taking a course in
that major.

Also discussed was the
possibility of compiling course
critiques to which students
could refer when selecting
courses.

EC examines adviser system

Such a system already exists
at the law school, where each
student critiques his courses,
and the critiques are compiled
and bound in a publication
available to all law students.

“Some times a very good pro-
fessor might have lousy
students who give him a lousy
critique,’’ upperclass law
representative Jim Green said.

“I think the faculty might be
kind of sensitive to it.’’

Freshman representative An-
drew Caruthers, sophomore
representatives Ken Lindeman
and James White and senior
representative George
Youmans were appointed to
serve with Messer on the sub-
committee.

In other action Monday night,
the EC decided to recommend
to the faculty Executive Com-
mittee that all classes be
dismissed Friday, May 11, the
first day of the 1984 Washington

 

and Lee Mock Democratic Con-
vention.

Steve Lewis, co-chairman of
the Mock Convention, requested
the action because the Mock
Convention parade will be held
at 10 that morning and the first
session will begin at 1 p.m. He
said classes on that day were
dismissed for the 1980 Mock
Convention. A final decision
must be made by the faculty.

Lewis also said that 25 states
have now raised money for the
Mock Convention. ‘‘I’m reason-
ably optimistic (regarding fund
raising),”’ he added.

The EC also relieved itself of
any immediate responsibility in
dealing with the Independent
Union. After a meeting among
the EC’s committee on in-
dependents, the Independent
Union and the Student Ac-
tivities Board, the organiza-
tions decided that the Indepen-
dent Union would work with the
SAB and would come to the EC
only if problems arose.

who stay out too long on New
Year’s Eve this year and don’t

Tuesday will be relieved to
learn that they will not have
missed classes that Monday.
But, in turn, they will be obliged
to attend classes the next Satur-

Because Jan. 1 falls on a Sun-

pushed back one day in the first
week of Winter term to allow
students an extra day after the

Edward C. Atwood, dean of the

man of the Faculty Executive
Committee.

Atwood said that since the
12-124 school calendar was
adopted in 1970, it has been
necessary to schedule Saturday
classes whenever the first falls
on a Sunday, about every six
years. He said the move was
necessary to get in 12 complete
weeks of classes: before the
Winter exam period.

He explained that the daily
class schedule would be thrown
off one day during that week
and that the Saturday classes
will actually be classes schedul-
ed for Friday.

“On Fridays there are really
no afternoon classes,’’ said At-
wood, ‘‘so we are really only
talking about Saturday morn-

Atwood also said that the first

After taking three months to
examine the details of each
case, a Rockbridge County Cir-
cuit Court judge has set the
sentencing dates for two

years, will be sentenced Dec. 12
for his conviction in September
of selling marijuana and
possession of marijuana with
intent to distribute.

William L. Dederick, who has

sentenced Dec. 12 for his
September conviction of selling
cocaine, possession of cocaine

stating that the exclusion of
Washington and Lee and Virgin-

from the jury lists is unconstitu-

The right to a jury that is

New theatre plans studied

By STEVE POCKRASS

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity has “made some pre-
liminary studies’ into the
possibility of constructing a
new theatre on the parking lot
east of the U.S. 60 overpass, ac-
cording to executive assistant
to the president Frank Parsons.
Parsons is quick to point out,
however, that these are only
preliminary studies and that
there is currently no source of
funds for the project.

cleared the project with both
William Watt, Dean of the Col-
lege, and Lewis John, Dean of
Students, and that Dederick will
receive no W&L credits for his
work. ;

Dederick has been suspend
for one year by the Student Af-
fairs Committee.

“Because of the sensitivity of
the issue,’ McDaniel said, ‘“‘I
cleared his being on campus
and in my office using the
library and research facilities.

“This is not something that
W&L has supported institu-
tionally. His status as far as
W&L is concerned has not

ed.

McDaniel said he felt the pro-
ject was worthwhile, both for
the community and for

“There are other possible
sites,’’ Parsons said, ‘‘(but) this
site does lend itself to the
development of theatre.”

Advantages of this location
include a large parking area
and the availability of the old
railroad station building, to
which the theatre would be jux-
taposed.

“In general, as the concept
has been developed, it would in-
corporate a three hundred seat

square feet in all.’’ Also includ-
ed would be a black box theatre,
a scene shop, rehearsal areas,

added, ‘‘And there really is a
great deal that could be learned
out there.

that he has some talents in this
sort of thing.’’

In approving the work-
release project, Honts told
Dederick, ‘‘I think the project is
worthwhile. This is an oppor-
tunity for you to do some useful
work during your incarcera-
tion.”

Among the conditions set by
Honts for the work-release pro-
gram were that Dederick must
return to the jail by 5 p.m. each
day and that he should not let

“Keep in mind that this is a
teaching theatre,’’ Parsons
said.

Plans for the theatre, which
would cost about $5 million
were drawn up by the architec-
tural firm of Ford, Powell, and
Carson of San Antonio, Texas.

‘“‘We don’t have the money for
it yet,’ Parsons said. ‘‘We are
exploring the possibilities of
funding it. Parsons also stated
that a couple of other alter-
natives are being explored, but
he said he was not at liberty to
discuss them.

If funding were available,
Ford, Powell and Carson would
associate with architects in this
area to supervise the construc-
tion.

“If we had a green light to-
day, we could develop the
theatre in two years,’ Parsons
said. ‘‘Because of funding pro-
blems, there is no green light to-
day. This said Parsons, is why
there has not been more news
about the theatre, and why he
cannot say if or when the
theatre will be built.

While there are other projects
under consideration, such as an
activities pavilion and more
student housing, “at the mo-
ment, it (the theatre) is a very
high priority need for us.’”’ Par-
sons said. ‘‘We’ve needed one
for quite some time,’’ explained
Parsons, whose role as the ex-
ecutive assistant to the presi-
dent includes the responsibility
for coordinating physical plan-
ning. During the fifteen years
he served under President
Huntley, about $35 million in
construction was completed.

1956 Mock Con was marked by tragedy —

By JOHN WILTSE
Mock Convention
_ Correspondent

A keynote address — the focal
point which sets the tone for any
event.

In 1956, the W&L Mock
Democratic Convention almost
didn’t carry out its respon-
sibilities because the keynote
speech cloaked the convention
in a temporary shadow of gloom
— a shadow darkened by
tragedy.

But it was not the keynote ad-
dress itself that enveloped the
convention in darkness — words
of inspiration actually filled
Doremus Gymnasium that day.
Instead, it was the loss of a
public servant that was felt by
all.

It was April 30, 1956, the open-
ing day of the Mock Convention,
and unusually warm Spring
temperatures topping 90
degrees baked the City of Lex-
ington. Washington and Lee
students crowded into the gym
to hear the address of the
keynote speaker, one of the
most experienced statesmen of
the era, Senator and former
Vice President Alben Barkley
of Kentucky.

Barkley had given 50 years of
his life to public service,
reaching his highest office as
Vice President under President
Harry S. Truman. After the ad-
ministration’s defeat in 1952,

Barkley returned to Kentucky
and became one of its Senators.

It was this change from occu-
pying the second highest office
in the land to becoming Ken-
tucky’s junior Senator that the
fiery and deliberate Barkley ad-
dressed after concluding his
prepared speech in front of an
excited and responsive au-
dience.

Barkley: ‘But I no longer
have any personal interest (in
standing for highest office). I
have served my country and my
people for half a century...I
went into the House of
Representatives in 1913 and
served 14 years; I was a junior
Congressman; then I became a
senior Congressman; and then I
went to the Senate and became
a junior Senator and then I
became a senior Senator, and
then I became majority leader
of the Senate, and then vice
president of the United States.
And now I’m back again as a
junior Senator. (laughter). And
I am WILLING to be a junior.
I’m GLAD to sit on the back
row.

“For I would rather be a ser-
vant (his voice booming by
now) in the house of the Lord

than to sit in the seats of the
mighty.”

As the crowd roared its ap-
proval, the 78-year-old Barkley
stepped back from the podium
— and collapsed. Within
minutes he was pronounced

dead of a heart attack.

John Jennings, W&L Pro-
fessor of journalism, was a stu-
dent here in 1956 and was the
sole reporter broadcasting the
Mock Convention on station
WREL when Barkley collapsed.

“I didn’t know what to think. I
was stunned... sort of bewil-
dered. I did not know what was
going on — like everyone else,”’
recalled Jennings.

This is how Jennings describ-
ed the tragedy over WREL in
1956: “Senator Barkley has just
collapsed after saying he would
‘rather be a servant in the house
of the Lord than to sit in the
seats of the mighty.’ He is now
being being fanned by the chair-
man of the convention...the
delegates are standing...there
is just an air of disbelief here.”’

All convention proceedings _

came to an end. Only Barkley’s
widow could make the student
delegates return to their task.
‘“‘You have’ unfinished
business,’’ she told convention

officals.

A week later, the students
reconvened and correctly
predicted that Adlai Stevenson
would once again be the
Democratic nominee.

Although Barkley’s keynote
address ended in tragedy, his
final words are regarded as one
of the meaningful and reflective
declarations of all public ser-
vants.

Letters to Ufle CLULLOrs

The Ring-tum Phi, December 1, 1983, Page 7

Admissions Office should recruit more actively

(continued from page 3)
applications had not reached
the ‘“‘alarmingly low levels”
cited by Davidson in its decision
to become coeducational; nor
had applications “receded to
near disaster levels,’’ as they
had at Sewanee in the years im-
mediately preceding the deci-
sion there to admit women.
Please remember that, in 1976,
the Board was informed of pro-
jections of ‘‘a levelling off (of
college-age populations) in the
late 1970s and a decline in the
1980s,’ in the report of the
Trustee Study Committee on
Coeducation, which was
chaired by Trustee Frank
Brooks. Why, then, did the
Board decide against coeduca-
tion?

In the press release announc-
ing its decision, the Board cited
“considerations of size, cur-
riculum, and_ traditional
character” as the factors in-
fluencing its decision. In-
terestingly enough, in an Ad-
missions Office survey of this
year’s freshman class, tradi-
tion, size, and academic stan-
dards were the factors most
often cited as influential in a
student’s decision to attend
Washington and Lee.

As we approach a period of
declining numbers of ap-
plicants, President Wilson has
asked the trustees to again con-
sider the question of coeduca-
tion. Recent admissions figures
reveal that the University is in
better shape, with regard to the
number of applicants, than it
was in 1976. The number of ap-
plications for this year’s
freshman class was 1,562, a con-
siderable improvement over
the low of 975. More important-
ly, however, since 1978, the year
in which Mr. William Hartog
came to W&L as director of ad-
missions, the number of
students who have enrolled
here, as a percentage of those
students offered admission, has
nosedived, from 57 percent to 42
percent. It would seem as
though Mr. Hartog has become

anywhere.

complacent, and sees coeduca-
tion as the way to attract
students to W&L without alter-
ing his current recruiting prac-
tices.

We feel that the significant
decrease in the percentage of
student enrolled is not justifica-
tion for admitting women.
Rather, it is an indication that
the Admissions Office is not
working hard enough to attract
students to Washington and
Lee. Please consider a few
more Statistics. First, the
distribution of freshmen by high
school rank is almost identical
this year to that in 1969. But in
1969, 47 percent of the ap-
plicants who were admitted ac-
tually enrolled. This year, only
42 percent enrolled. Some would
argue that this is true because
students do not want to attend
an all-male college. Question-
naires distributed to all
students admitted prove other-
wise. The Trustee Study Com-
mittee on Coeducation reported
in 1976 that ‘‘almost 50 percent”’
of admitted students who chose
to go elsewhere did so based
partially on a desire to attend a
coeducational school. The
results of this year’s survey
show that only 34 percent of the
students who decline offers of
admission here consider the
lack of coeducation to be a
drawback. We must conclude,
therefore, that the inability to
attract students to Washington
and Lee is rooted not in a desire
on the students’ part to attend
coeducational colleges, but,
rather, in less-than-vigorous
recruitment practices on the
part of the Admissions Office.

In a recent poll of 1983
freshmen, conducted by the Ad-
missions Office, 48 percent of
the respondents reported that
they. had first become _in-
terested in Washington and Lee
through alumni (19 percent),
parents (16 percent), or current
students (13 percent). In only 15
percent of the cases did the
university initiate contact,
through student search. More

applicants found out about W&L
through college guides and
other reference books than
through their high school
guidance counselors! The
message contained in these
statistics is that many students
are not applying to Washington
and Lee because they don’t
know about it. While we agree
that alumni and current
students are an important arm
of the admissions process, we
conclude that this arm has
become gangrenous. A repre-
sentative of the Alumni Admis-
sions program, with whom we
spoke, indicated that there is
virtually no cooperation or com-
munication between the Alumni
Admissions program and the
Admissions Office. The Student
Recruitment Committee is
designed primarily for the
benefit of students who have
already applied. Clearly, both
of these organizations are in
need of strengthening and ex-
pansion.

We recommend, therefore,
that the Admissions Office
adopt and practice a policy of
actively recruiting students —
that is, getting them to apply,
and, more importantly, getting
them to attend W&L once they
have been accepted. There is,
currently, no member of the Ad-
missions staff whose full-time
job is to travel to schools and
recruit top-notch students. One
should be hired immediately.
This person need not fly to
Idaho or South Dakota in search
of students; rather, he or she
should concentrate on attrac-
ting students from nearby
states. While W&L is well
respected in areas of high alum-
ni concentration, it is virtually
unknown outside these areas.
As aresult, Washington and Lee
has only a total of 165
undergraduate students from
the nearby states of North
Caroline, Tennessee, Kentucky,
South Carolina and West
Virginia. Surely an_ intense
recruiting effort in these states
could add at least 150 more high
calibre students to the W&L
population during the lean
years ahead. We further recom-
mend that the Admissions Of-
fice strive for closer coopera-
tion with the Alumni Admis-
sions program and that they

work to expand the role of this
program. Additionally, we
recommend that the Student
Recruitment Committee be
enlarged, and that its role be ex-
panded.

We recommend to the Board
of Trustees that they recall the
conclusions they reached - in
1976, namely, ‘‘that coeducation
would almost necessarily re-
quire a substantial increase in
the size of the W&L student
body,” and that coeducation
would represent a significant
break with tradition; and, fur-
ther, we hope that they will con-
sider the fact that it is the small
size and rich tradition of the
University which attracts
students to Washington and
Lee. We further recommend
that they consider that, as
President Wilson has reported,
demographic trends will re-

verse by 1992 and the period of
crisis will have passed. We urge
the Board of Trustees to keep
these factors in mind, to
recognize that any decision
made at this time would be ir-
reversible, and ultimately, to
reject any proposal for co-
education at Washington and
Lee at any time in_ the
forseeable future.

We conclude, finally, that a
‘go-get-em admissions policy,
even without the projected
reversal of demographic trends
by 1992, will ensure that
Washington and Lee can re-
main all-male and academical-
ly excellent long into the next
century.

EC should regard
honor not conduct

To the Editors:

I must take serious issue with
the recent decision of the Ex-
ecutive Committee to consider
the sale of drugs for profit as a
violation of the Honor System.
While I do not disagree with the
premise that one dealing in
drugs should be expelled from
the University, I do not see the
wisdom of placing this trans-
gression under the auspices of
the Executive Committee.

Last year’s White Book em-
phasizes that the Honor System
is designed to foster a mutual
trust within the Washington and
Lee community. Our student
government makes a clear
distinction between honor viola-
tions and conduct offenses. The
former are handled by the EC,
while the latter are under the
jurisdiction of the Student Con-
trol Committee and the Student
Affairs Committee.

One could most simply define
honor and conduct offenses in
the following manner. Honor of-
fenses are those that in the
words of the White Book “‘in-
dicate a student is not worthy of
trust by his peers.’’ Conduct
violations prove that a person is
unable to conduct himself in a

legal or civilized manner, or
that he poses a threat to the
safety of amember or members
of the University community.

While our White Book says
(and I wholeheartedly agree)
that honor cannot be codified, it
goes on to explain that lying,
cheating, and stealing are ob-
vious violations. I do not think
that anyone has been convicted
of an honor violation for any
other type of offense since I
have been at W&L. Yet, an EC
which finds it necessary to elicit
student opinion by a poll on
issues such as coeducation and
grading policies, does not seem
to feel the need to do likewise
when considering a drastic
reinterpretation (not revision)
of the Honor System. This
reinterpretation is even more
radical in light of the fact that
last year’s EC voted against
such a change while this year’s
voted unanimously for the new
policy.

I have always heard and
believed that the single sanction
is justified by a belief that honor
has no degrees. Yet during its

‘debate of the issue of drug

sales, the EC found it necessary
to say that the use of drugs is
different from the sale of drugs,
because a drug dealer has a
profit motive. If the state of
Virginia were suddenly to
reinstate Prohibition, one must
wonder if the EC would feel the
same duty to prosecute in-
dustrious minks who wanted to
make a few extra dollars by im-
porting out-of-state liquor to the
W&L campus.

In conclusion, I believe that it
is necessary for the student
body to let the Student Control
Committee and Student Affairs
Committee know of its dis-
pleasure with drug dealers. The
SAC has expulsion power; it
should have the courage to use
it. There are inherent dangers

Stones show new outlook

By EDWIN BELL
Staff Reporter

Several facts must be men-
tioned before the album can be
discussed. First, Mick Jagger
turned 40 last summer and
Keith Richards turns 40 on Dec.
18. Bill Wyman and Charlie
Watts, are even older. Only Rob
Wood, 31, is still a young man. I
do not point out this fact to join
the masses in saying the Stones
are too old. The Who did not
break up because of their ages,
but because of personal dif-
ferences. Their music was still
very much to be admired.

The reason I point out this
fact is that the Stones’ recent
album, Undercover, is also a
great album. Their age would
lead one to believe that the
Stones are too old to be thinking
of politics, girls and
debauchery. To the contrary,
the Stones aren’t too old to think
about these things only their
perspective has changed. Once
known for their reputation as
degenerates and outlaws, they
now have become mature
adults with families of their
own. But the band has not
forgotten its roots, they still like
to write about sex and violence.

“ ~y ‘ >

 

 

Undercover is the album the
Stones have always wanted to
record. The work is steeped in
violence, sex and macho chest-
beating of the male ego. Yet the
Stones deal with these subjects
in a unique approach, not the
Straight-forward approach of
others. Jagger has often said
that these themes are only
meant to poke fun at the intend-
ed objects of attack. Songs
about girls are the Stones
favorite with Some Girls, T&A,
and Brown Sugar. Also the
Stones albums are beginning to
be easily identified by structure
— 10 songs, mostly uptempo
numbers (thank God, all uptem-
po this time), one Keith song,
and one reggae tune.

The best songs on the album
are Undercover, She Was Hot,
Wanna Hold You Too Tough,
Too Much Blood and It Must Be
Hell. The album, unlike others,
has a number of good singles.
An interview in the December
1983 Musician Magazine with
Keith Richards picks the single
to be She Was Hot, but it turns
out to be Undercover. Under-
cover is definitely a step for-
ward for Richards and Jagger.

The song features the steady

~ and always precise backbeat of

aR

Charlie Watts and mixes the

Philip Booth

guitars in a _pseudo-reggae
rhythm. Undercover is_ the
Stones contribution to current
politics. What is going on in
South America? they ask.

Too Tough is also in this
genre. Here the Stones again
assert infallibility of the male
ego. The cut features some
great guitar work from Ron
Wood. It Must Be Hell again
finds the Stones questioning the
world. Jagger calmly asks the
East, “‘What’s wrong with your
worl’?”

Richards’ song on the album,
Wanna Hold You, is not as good
as Happy or T&A, but then
again, it is different. The song
seems to be his declaration of
love for his girl, Patti Hansen.
Unlike most Stones songs, here
Richards says he’ll be the lover
and slave.

Now for the Mick Jagger ex-
planation of love, Tie You Up
(the pain of love). Jagger
should know a lot about the sub-
ject seeing how he has been
divorced from two wives, ac-
counted for a bastard child and
is expecting a new child from
his live-in-partner Jerry Hall.

Overall the Stones new album
is great. It gives us fresh songs
that reflect the current musical
trends of today, but also re-

 

mains true to the Stones’ classic
R&B sound we all love. Also the
album addresses current issues
of our world such as South
America and the East-West ten-
sions, as well as the problems of
violence and ‘‘too much blood”’
on the screen.

Yet the Stones do not overdo
their political feelings like The
Clash nor do they fall in the
Rolling Stone Magazine’s
classic five star category,
which considers deep. political
thought a must. Instead they
address the problems from a
different view, they raise the
issues as questions for the

public to decide.

Undercover is a fine example
of what a band can do even
though they are supposedly
“over the hill.”” The Stones are
very much like the musicians
they admire. Rhythm and Blues
greats such as Muddy Waters
and rock and roll’s founders

such as Chuck Berry still play
their music today as they did
when they were 20. Nothing is
wrong with playing music when
you’re 40 as long as you respect-
fully pass something on to the
next generation. Surely the
Rolling Stones have done this.

Film Society presents
Devil’s Playground

The Washington and Lee Film
Society’s third presentation of
the 1983-84 season will be the
1976 Australian film ‘The
Devil’s Playground’ (107
minutes), directed by Fred
Schepisi. The film will be shown
at 8 p.m. on Friday, Dec. 2 and
Saturday, Dec. 3 in classroom
“A” of Lewis Hall in the Law
School. There is no charge for
admission.

“The Devil’s Playground’’ is
director Schepisi’s (The Chant
of Jimmie Blacksmith, Bar-
barosa) semi-autobiographical
account of life in a Catholic
seminary school in Australia in
the early 1950s. Not surprising-
ly, considerable tension is
created by the conflict between
the developing sexuality of the
adolescent boys and the teach-
ings of the Church, ad-
ministered by the school’s

monks. This conflict and the
resulting problems are exacer-
bated by the school’s isolation
and the exclusively-male
character of the student body
and the clerical teaching staff.
Schepisi’s treatment of these
themes is tactful and balanced.
He does not oversimplify or
misrepresent the characters as
stereotypical innocent school-
boys or as dogmatically op-
pressive clerics. Instead, there
is sympathetic understanding

for both the boys and the
teachers, who, after all, are
subject to many of the same
frustrations and constraints.

“The Devil’s Playground is
an intelligent and sensitive at-
tempt to portray the problems
of growing up naturally in an
unnatural environment. Indeed,
few films have so well captured
the sheer embarrassment of
growing up.

 

 
New duPont exhibit
features photographs

The works of four Virginia
photographers make up the new
exhibition in Washington and
Lee duPont Gallery.

The photographers whose

works will comprise the exhibi-
tion are W. Patrick Hinely of
Lexington, Nancy Lensen-
Tomasson of Richmond, Ter-
ence Roberts of Blacksburg,
and Steve Zapton of Harrison-
burg.
The exhibition will remain on
view through Dec. 16. A recep-
tion for the artists will be held
tomorrow from 5 p.m. to7 p.m.

Hinely is a native of Jackson-
ville, Fla., and a graduate of
Washington and Lee. He has ex-
hibited in group and one-man
shows in his home state of
Florida as well as in Virginia,
South Carolina, Washington,
and Alberta, Canada. Currently
university photographer at
W&L, he will show images of
Florida in black and white.

Lenson-Tomasson is a native
of Washington, D.C., and re-
ceived her undergraduate de-
gree from Wellesley College
with graduate degrees from the
University of New Mexico. She

is assistant professor in the
department of photograph and
film at Virginia Commonwealth
University in Richmond. Her
works have been exhibited in
several shows and one-person
exhibitions. She will be ex-
hibiting Ektacolor prints of her
magnolia series.

Roberts received his bache-
lor’s degree from the Univer-
sity of Virginia and studied
photography at Corcoran
School of Art in Washington.
During 1983 he has been com-
missioned to create two in-
Stallations for businesses in
Washington. The recipient of
the $1,000 Award of Excellence
at the 27th Annual Virginia
Beach Boardwalk Art Show
earlier this year, he will exhibit
hand-tinted photographs.

Zapton is a native of Detroit
and received his bachelor’s
degree in fine arts from the
University of Michigan and his
master’s from the Pratt In-
stitute. A member of the James
Madison University faculty

Education and athletics

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

....All Lexington is disgrun-
tled about such a monumental
topic as high school football
with the off again, on again, off
again soap opera featuring Ron
Pyles and a cast of thousands.
It’s the cast’ of thousands that
I’m worried about. What I think
we have here is alot of missing
information. (Are you listening
out there at the Committee for
Joint Control and the School
Board? ) Missing information, it
would seem, only heightens ten-
sion. Something that the pro-
blem at Lex High didn’t need
any more of. Coach...er ex-
Coach Pyles obviously had
something to say Monday night,
but the School Board refused to
hear it. In the earlier meeting of
the Committee for Joint Con-
trol, more questions were left
unsolved like why was Pyles ac-
tually reinstated, or for that
matter, why was he ever re-
moved? Also, why was Prin-
cipal Glen Stark, the man who
heard the original complaints
against Pyles, not called to
testify? Not tosay that answers
to any of these questions would
immediately rectify the situa-

tion, but a little pertinent would
certainly have gotten matters
back under control and pointed
in the right direction. As it is,
Pyles has resigned, this time
for good, and those who are say-
ing the matter is best left un-
discussed perhaps fail to see the

cifents igh an unresolved

situation can have on the com-
munity and the relationship be-
tween athletics and education, a
relationship that must remain
strong and pure if education, as
a whole, is to be meaningful and
productive...

that right chemistry he was
looking for a couple couple of
weeks back. Freshman Keith
Brideweiser and Scott Shannon

thank you the play of steady
John Lee Graves to illustrate a
point. The key to the Generals’
success is that they know what
they can and can’t do, and
they’re very good at putting this
knowledge into practice. One
other thing, the Generals are
often going to be outmanned
talent wise. That is, except at

Franke sees success

Washington and Lee’s head
wrestling coach Gary Franke is
very optimistic about this
year’s team. ‘‘We have the op-
portunity to be very com-
petitive in all 15 meets this
year,” said Franke. ‘“‘We have
good wrestlers in most of the
weight classes, and if we stay
free of injury we should have
another successful season,’’ ac-
cording to Franke.

The team, which posted a 9-2
record last year, welcomes
seven returning lettermen. The
team is led by seniors Carlton
Peebles and Tim Valliere and
junior Jeff Dixon. Both Dixon

y

and Valliere were undefeated in
last year’s dual-meet action.

The Generals will open their
season in Lynchburg against
Lynchburg College on Nov. 30.
When the teams met last year
W&L won by a score of 22-21.

On Saturday, Dec. 3, the W&L
Tournament will be hosted by
the Generals. The tournament
will include Hiram College, Get-
tysburg College, George Wash-
ington University, Longwood
College, University of Scranton,
Virginia Military Institute and
York College. Last year W&L
placed seventh in the competi-
tion.

...While we were away there
was that ‘‘fight’”’ extravaganza
staged by NBC. Let’s face it, the
only man who wanted the title
fight in the ring was the one who
couldn’t win it, namely Joe
Frazier. It was all Joe could do
to keep himself from jumping in

McBryde earns A-A status

Senior Angus McBryde earn-
ed All-America status in NCAA
Division III cross country when

he finished tenth in the national .

meet at Christopher Newport
College in Newport News, Va.,
on Saturday, November 19.

McBryde covered the 8,000-
meter course in a time of 24
minutes, 19 seconds.

A week earlier he had cap-
tured the regional qualifying
meet on the same course with a

time of 24 minutes, 36 seconds.
“We had to be happy that
Angus improved his time by 17
seconds from the regional meet
to the national meet,” said W&L
cross country coach Dick Mil-
ler. “Angus had a genuinely
sensational season progressed.
I couldn’t be happier for him.”
Earlier this season McBryde
captured the ODAC individual
crown and was named the Run-
ner of the Year in the ODAC.

Swimmers fall short to Hopkins

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
swimming and diving team lost
a dual meet to Division III na-
tional powerhouse Johns
Hopkins, 57-56, on Nov. 18 at
W&L’s Cy Twombly Pool.

W&L coaches labeled the
defeat a disappointing one. ‘“‘We
were disappointed that we
came so close to beating
Hopkins but just couldn’t quite
do it,” said head swimming
coach Pago Remillard. ‘‘You
can look back over the meet and
find many places where we

could have picked up the
necessary point to win it.”

The Generals (1-1) outscored
Hopkins in the swimming
events, but suffered a 16-2 set-
back in the diving competition.
In NCAA competition, swimm-
ing and diving scores are com-
bined to produce an overall
score.

Diving coach Bob Newcomb
said, “I am not disappointed
with the way that the divers
performed.’’ According to
Newcomb, the divers, freshmen
Joe Donovan and Matt Divito,

Cagers bounce back,

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

The Generals’ basketball
team defeated Hampden-Syd-
ney, 63-52, Tuesday night in
Warner Center, evening their
record at 2-2 after losing both
games of the W&L Tip-Off Tour-
nament tostart the season.

For the third game this
season, 6-5 senior forward John
Lee Graves led the Generals in
scoring, getting 24 points in the
ODAC-opener against Hamp-
den-Sydney.

In the Tip-Off Tournament
W&L lost the opener to SUNY
Old Westbury, 55-51, and the
consolation game to Eastern
College, 47-45. ‘‘(In the tourna-
ment) the opposition was ex-
tremely strong and we were
very young and inexperienc-
ed,” head coach Verne Canfield
commented. But he added, “‘We
did more things right than
wrong.”

W&L’s first victory of the

 

 

bell)

    
 

season came at UNC-Greens-
boro, 43-42, on Nov. 22. In this
game the Generals applied
some of the lessons they learned
in the Tip-Off Tournament, ac-
cording to Canfield.

‘“‘We found that on offense we
had to control the ball rather
than just run up the court,” said
Canfield.

Against Hampden-Sydney,
the Generals did just that, mak-
ing 25 of 40 field goals (62.5%) to
the Tigers 21 of 44 (47.7%). W&L
also hit on 11 out of 16 free
throws, all in the second half.

The second-leading scorer
behind Graves is 6-2 junior
guard Lex Fitzenhagen, with
9.75 points per game. Fitzen-
hagen had 15 points against the
Tigers, including two three-
point plays late in the second
half that helped put the game
out of reach.

chey added 10 points and junior
forward Scott Shannon had six
points and led the team in re-
bounds with eight.

The Generals’ next game will
be against Ithaca College in the
Ithaca Tournament on Dec. 3.
The other teams participating
will be Lehman and Western
New England.

According to Canfield, all
three of the other teams are
strong, coming off winning
seasons and returning all their
starters.

‘“‘When you play the host team
in the first game, you can ex-
pect the other teams to be
stronger than you,’’ said Can-
field. This is because the host
team tends to make sure it in-
vites less-talented teams to its
tournament, and to make sure it
plays the weakest team in the
first game, according to Can-
field.

He also noted that the fact
that W&L came last in its own
tournament is an indication of
the strength of the Generals’
schedule this season.

“This is the toughest schedule
we’ve had in the 20 years I’ve
been coaching here,’’ said Can-
field.

The Generals’ next home
game is against ODAC-oppon-
ent Catholic University on Dec.

Pyles resigns at Lex High

By PAUL CLARK
. Staff Reporter

The saga has ended. Or
maybe it has just begun. That
seems to be the question these
days at Lexington High School
where head football coach Ron
Pyles has left his job for the se-
cond time this year, this time
for good.

As reported in the Nov. 10
issue of the Ring-tum Phi,
Coach Pyles had come under
considerable pressure from
reports that he had mistreated
his players. After being
dismissed from his coaching
duties by the county superinten-
dent, Pyles was re-instated in a
hearing last month by the Com-
mittee for Joint Control, at
which point his assistant
coaches resigned.

This past Monday Pyles

resigned offically when the
school board refused to allow
Pyles to ‘“‘name names’’ in his
defense. Pyles apparently felt,
and many people seem to agree,
that he should have had an op-
portunity to name people in his
defense.

When the board refused to let j

Pyles speak, he walked to the
front of the room and presented
his resignation.

“T think it’s a shame that...he
couldn’t name people in that
hearing. He basically pleaded
for an opportunity to give his
side of the story,’”’ said Gerald
Darrell, W&L Food Services
Manager.

Many Lexington High parents
and football players say they
feel like they’ve lost a good
coach and a good man. On the
other side, though, many
parents feel like it is time to
move ahead and start anew.
Glen Stark, Lexington High
Principal, has said, “‘it’s all
history now...talking about it
won’t do any good.”’ It would ap-
pear that ex-coach Pyles feels
differently. In a report in the
Lexington News-Gazette, Pyles
said that if he could raise the
money he would take legal ac-
tion against the persons who
tainted his name. He feels that
because of the “‘stigma’’ hang-
ing over him he will not have an
easy time finding a job.

Perhaps Genevieve Fried-
man, mother of team co-captain
Frank Friedman, summed up
many of the parents feelings
best in an Associated Press
release ‘‘If he has to take other
people down with him, if what
he has tosay casts bad things on
other people, then it’s better off
not said.”

At this point, Lexington prin-
cipal Glen Stark has started an
advisory committee of school
board members, teachers, par-
ents, and players to help heal
the wounds caused by the foot-
ball melee. However, the ten-
sion still leaves Lexington High
torn apart.

at 4:15 this afternoon, and the
faculty is expected to make a

EC President Bob Jenevein
will ask the faculty Monday to
reconsider implementing the
plus-minus system for up-
perclassmen.

“‘T hope one of the considera-
tions (the faculty takes into ac-
count) is how the students want
tobe graded,”’ Jenevein said.

“The students don’t think
they should be subjected to it,
either for fairness or because
they think it might hurt them.
They don’t agree with what the

This year’s EC has received
some criticism, Jenevein ack-
nowledged, for taking up the
plus-minus issue nearly a year
and a half after its adoption by
the faculty. He pointed out,
however, that the initial deci-
sion was made too late for the
1981-82 EC to act on it, and that
last year’s EC was caught be-
tween the time the policy was
adopted and its implementa-

Conduct decision, not honor

(continued from page 7)
in passively allowing the boun-
daries of honor to stretch
beyond lying, cheating, and
stealing. First, it makes one
wonder what new interpretation

the EC will issue next, Suppose
that the University receives bad
publicity because a freshman
dies in an alcohol-related acci-
dent due to intoxication induced
by liquor which his dorm
counselor obtains for him (not
an unknown practice). Would
the dorm counselor’s actions

suddenly become, to use

freshman representative An-
drew Caruther’s words, ‘‘dis-
honorable and disreputable?”’
Secondly, in handling what
were previously conduct of-
fenses, the EC finds itself in the
precarious position of making
gradations among certain acts.
For example, it is not dis-
honorable to demand drugs, bur
it is dishonorable to .supply
them. With the varying penal-
ties at its disposal, Student Af-
fairs is more capable of discuss-
ing such issues. In the cases in-
volving students convicted of
selling drugs earlier this year,

the SAC not only did not expel
the students, it also assessed
different penalties. There must
have been a good reason for the
SAC’s decisions. An honor con-
viction, however, provides only
one penalty. I do not believe
that a drug dealer deserves to
stay in the university any more
than I believe that a petty thief
deserves to be a student. I simp-
ly assert that different bodies
should expel them. I know that I
cannot trust a thief; a drug en-
trepreneur who provides what
in some circles is a desired
commodity, has only proven
that he is ungentlemanly and
capable of committing a very
serious violation of the law. Il-
legality and dishonor are not

. necessarily synonymous.

New trustees

include
Tom Wolfe

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

Four new members of the Washington
ind Lee Board of Trustees were announc-
ed Friday, including Tom Wolfe, author of
the best-selling book, The Right Stuff which
Sa major current movie.

\lso named were James F. Gallivan,
National Sales Manager for J.C. Bradford
& Co. in Nashville; Frances A. Lewis, ex-
ecutive vice president of Best Products Co
n Richmond; and Charles S. Rowe, the
editor and co-publisher of the
redericksburg Free Lance-Star.

The four were elected to six-year terms
which begin on Jan. 1

jack Warner, the Alabama paper com-
pany executive for whom the Warner
\thletic Center is named, is retiring from
the Board and will become a Trustee
Emeritus.

Frank Brooks, E. Waller Dudley, and
Sydney Lewis have all served the max-
imum allowed twelve consecutive years on
the Board, and will be eligible for re-
election in a vear.

James Whitehead, secretary of the
University and by virtue of that office
secretary of the Board of Trustees, said
that Gallivan was elected to the Board by a
vote of the University’s alumni.

He said that the alumni recommend a
candidate for Trustee in that way every
two years. The other three were chosen
first by the Board’s nominating commit-
tee, and were then elected at the October
meeting of the trustees.

James M. Ballengee, Rector of the
Board, said that the four accepted their ap-
pointments within 10 days of that meeting.

University President John D. Wilson
said, ‘‘In any active renewal you have feel-
ings of loss, to be sure, but also feelings of
anticipation for the new talent and new
ideas you'll have access to.””

Wilson pointed out that until the institu-

tion of six year terms, members served un-

til they chose to retire.

“Great trustees came out of that tradi-
tion,” he said. ‘‘This way, though, you br-

ing new ideas and new energy to bear and
share the governance responsibility.”’

Wilson said he met Wolfe, a 1951 W&L
graduate, at a conference in Richmond at
which they both spoke two years ago.

He said that he met with Gallivan, a
classmate of Wolfe’s who was national
president of the Alumni Association in
1981-82, shortly after his election to the
presidency of the university last year.

Wilson said that he and his wife had
spent a week at the summer home of
Frances Lewis, wife of retiring trustee
Sydney Lewis, the chairman of Best Pro-

ducts.

‘“They’re a partnership in a very ex-
traordinary way,’ Wilson said. ‘‘Their
love for W&L is mutual and shared. She’s a
strong personality in her own right, and an
outstanding addition to the board.’’ Lewis
Hall is named for her.

The president said that this year he had
been the guest of Rowe at Strattord Hall,
the Lee ancestral home on the Potomac
and birthplace of Robert E. Lee. Rowe, a
1947 graduate, also attended Wilson’s in-
auguration last spring.

Plus-minus
stands
despite
protest

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

 

The faculty has rejected the Executive
Committee’s request that the plus-minus
grading system not affect upperclassmen.

During the faculty meeting Monday
afternoon, no faculty member moved that
a vote be taken on the issue, according to
Edward Atwood, dean of the Commerce
School.

A new motion would have had to been
made on the issue for a vote to have been
taken, Atwood said, because the Faculty
Committee on Courses and Degrees voted
against recommending the proposal to the
entire faculty.

“If anyone on the faculty had wanted to
change that, he would have had to make
another motion,’’ Atwood said. ‘‘There
was no motion to change our present
system.”

EC President Bob Jenevein presented
the students’ case to the faculty and cited
last week’s poll that showed 83 percent of
the students voted against having the plus-
minus system affect upperclassmen. Dean
of Students Lewis John told the faculty

Faculty takes latest round over
students with plus/minus victory

By G. BRUCE POTTER

Another chapter in the saga of
administration/faculty-student
relations has come to an end,
and the faculty has won the
latest round.

A little more than a month
ago, the Executive Committee
began lobbying against the
plus-minus grading system’s af-
fecting upperclassmen. Those
of you who were around in April
1982 will recall the faculty’s ap-
proval of that system to go into
effect this fall.

It was there, though, that the
problems perhaps began. Many
students assumed the changes
would be phased in, just as the
distribution requirements and

Comment

 

the increased graduation re-
quirements were.

Such was not to be the case,
though, as The Ring-tum Phi
reported in its first issue this
year. The plus-minus system
would affect everybody at the
same time.

Here is where the second pro-
blem occurred. Rather than im-
mediately jumping on the band-
wagon of change, the EC waited
until the end of October before
deciding to poll students on the
issue and then didn’t hold the
poll until last week.

It must be noted here that the
EC was not complaining about
the new grading system per se,
EC President Bob Jenevein and
the students were arguing that
the system shouldn’t affect up-
perclassmen who came to W&L
under a_ different grading
system.

Indeed, Jenevein has
acknowledged that the plus-
minus system is a good idea,
and I tend to agree.

However, by waiting until the

last minute, the EC had to con-
duct a poll (83 percent of
students against plus-minus af-
fecting upperclassmen) and
petition the faculty committee
on courses and degrees, the
University Council and the
faculty as a whole all within a
week and all just before exams.

Although this delay brought
what may have been justified
criticism of the EC, it was not
reason enough for the faculty’s
out-of-hand rejection of the peti-
tion.

But the faculty did just that.

Last Thursday’s University
Council meeting was almost
more of a farce than the EC’s
coeducation poll. Jenevein was
prepared to logically discuss
the issue with the faculty and
administration, but the faculty
and administration did not
seem to be prepared to listen.

Faculty, particularly Deans
Atwood and Watt, continually
interupted Jenevein’s state-
ments and showed little respect
for his position.

Atwood complained that he
might have to give a freshman
and a sophomore in the same
course different grades.(He
didn’t mention that because the
two students were in different
classes, they would never be
compared to each other for
ODK, Who’s Who, or Phi Beta

Kappa.)
Watt told the EC president,
“That (argument) really

doesn’t hold water, Mr. Jene-
vein.”

Oh, and then there was that
compromise that said students
who failed to graduate because
of plus-minus might receive
special consideration from the
automatic rule committee.

Of course, it didn’t quite say
that. It suggested that the
courses and degrees committee
consider doing that.

It was not a recommendation.
(‘I wouldn’t vote for that,” said

The Ring-tum Phi is published every Thursday during the undergraduate school year at
Washington and Lee University, Lexington, Virginia. Funding for the Ring-tum Phi
comes primarily from advertising and from a portion of the student activities fee. The
Publications Board elects the Chief Editors and Business Manager, but the Ring-tum Phi
is otherwise independent.

 

 

 

Dr. Harlan Beckley.)

The compromise also means
little because a student who
falls under the automatic rule
can petition the committee to
reconsider his status if there
have been extenuating cir-
cumstances. Suddenly being
graded under a new system in
one’s senior year could be con-
sidered an extenuating cir-
cumstance, one would hope.

Nevertheless, the point is that
the student members of the UC
were willing to listen to the
faculty, willing to accept a com-
promise. The faculty members
rather obviously just wanted to
go home, and thus no action was
taken on the real _ issue
—whether plus-minus should af-
fect upperclassmen.

One would have hoped that
Jenevein would have been
treated with a little more
respect when he made his
presentation to the entire facul-
ty Monday.

Unfortunately, he was not.
Not one faculty member in Nor-
then Auditorium was willing to
stand up and make the neces-
sary motion to support the EC’s
peittion. In fact, there was little
discussion on an issue 83 per-
cent of the students supported.

Because faculty meetings are
closed (even Jenevein was ex-
cused after his statement), no
one will know exactly what was
said. What resulted, though,
was an insensitive repudiation
of the student body’s wishes.

Dean Attwood’s comment to
me this week is typical: ‘‘What
is there to discuss?” he asked
rhetorically.

But listen to Jenevein at Mon-
day’s EC meeting: ‘‘We very
logically expressed what seem-
ed to me a very soundly-based
student sentiment and they
completely, insensitively turn-
ed their backs on us. There was
clearly no desire on the part of
the faculty to accommodate our
request.”’

Jenevein also described the
faculty as ‘‘closed-minded,
cold.”

“T got the distinct impression
that they didn’t want to bother
with having different grading
systems,’’ he added.

Whatever the faculty’s opi-
nions and wishes, there was ab-
solutely no need for the lack of
respect apparently accorded
Jenevein, the EC and the stu-
dent body.

Only one good thing resulted
from this confrontation: an-
nouncements of the UC meeting
included the items on the agen-
da.

That is the first step toward
improving relations.

But after the faculty’s actions
this week, we apparently still
have a long way to go.

To the Editors:

This has been an interesting
year to read the Ring-tum Phi.
The numerous letters reveal an
unusual level of interest in the
issues under consideration. It is
clear that Washington and Lee
has entered a period of self-
examination that may lead to
significant changes in this in-
stitution. Although all of the
issues now being discussed
(coeducation, fraternities,
grading, distribution re-
quirements, and calendar)
have been considered before,
never have so many issues been
debated at the same time; nor
has the probability of change
seemed so likely.

I think most of us in this com-
munity welcome the open de-
bate, and we are glad to see the

free exchange of ideas and sen-
timents, but some of the
statements now being made
reveal misconceptions and a
lack of understanding. Among
the misconceptions sometimes
stated are the idea that ‘‘the
faculty” is of a-single mind on
the issues and that President
Wilson is in some way responsi-
ble for the problems now being
debated.

I have been a member of this
faculty for nearly twenty-five
years. Rarely has the faculty
voted unanimously on anything.
Only slightly more than half
favored the 12-12-46 calendar
when it was adopted in 1970, at
least a third disagreed with the
recently enacted change in

Parents correct charges

To the Editors:

We present our reply to Dr.
Williams’ letter as printed in
your Dec. 1 issue.

We are immensely disturbed
by the erroneous information
issued by Dr. Williams. We
want to make the W&L com-
munity cognizant of the fact
that his written word is com-
pletely inaccurate regarding
the “Generals” during the W&L
Tip-Off Tournament.

We were present for the tour-
nament and can attest to the
presence of team members and

game and awards presentation.

To the Editors:

As a member of the Washing-
ton and Lee University basket-
ball team, I found Dr. Williams’
letter in the Dec. 1 issue of The
Ring-tum Phi very distress-
ing. As a four-year member of
the team, I have never known it
(the team) to behave in a man-
ner that was anything less than
that of class. The W&L Tip-Off
Tournament was no exception.
Since Dr. Williams was one of
the few people from the
Washington and Lee communi-
ty present, I find it very disturb-
ing that his account to that com-
munity was very much in error.

Every member of the team
and its coach was there for a
half or better, and over half of
the ‘‘tournament hosts’’ not on-
ly were present for the awards
ceremony, but also were en-
thusiastic in their support of the
efforts of those two teams. I find
it almost unforgivable that the
eventual author of such a
pointed letter could overlook
such a fact.

need. However Dr. Williams
has necessitated this response
to assure that the W&L stand-
ards have been upheld by the
basketball team family. The
team did perform in a courteous
and responsible manner. They
were visibly present and sup-
portive of their school’s tourna-
ment.

The sparse crowd attending
the game is another reason why
it seems unlikely that such an
oversight by a college professor
could take place and we hope
the W&L community will con-
tinue to support such a fine
representative of the university
as the basketball team.

The Ring-tum Phi, December 8, 1983, Page 3

 

Pub Board could have purse strings tightened

Is reserve fund an unfair financial advantage ?

by SCOTT MASON

The final Ring-tum Phi issue
for 1983 has at long last arrived.
It’s called the Christmas issue,
but the Phi isn’t celebrating. Its
Christmas came last
September at the Executive
Committee budget hearing. At
that hearing, the EC donned
white beards and red suits and
handed the Phi a Christmas gift
of $13,000. Santa Claus had
come to town.

It’s not as if the Phi is hurting
for money. Until recently, it had
access to about 8,000 extra
dollars tucked away for safe
keeping. It’s lost some of that
money now, but still has several
thousand surplus dollars. The
money has come from left-over
budget funds which the Phi
always seems to save at the end

of each school year. But the Phi
alone doesn’t share that money.
It, along with the Calyx and the
Ariel, are all governed by
what’s known as the Publica-
tions Board, and the money is
part of the Pub Board Reserve

Reader’s

Fund. If the Phi, Calyx or Ariel
gets into financial trouble, they
always have the reserve fund to
bail them out. The money is also
available for legal fees and
possible libel suits. Whatever
its use, the extra money makes
for a nice security blanket

which other committees don’t
have.

But that’s exactly the pro-
blem. While the Phi, Calyx and
Ariel are sitting financially fat,
other committees are desper-
ately searching their pockets to
come up with enough money
just to survive. The question
some people are asking is why
The Ring-tum Phi, The Calyx
and the Ariel continue to get
money from the Executive
Committee when there’s all this
surplus cash sitting in the Pub
Board Reserve Fund? Why not
force these organizations to dip
into the reserve fund? That
way, money that would have or-
dinarily been budgeted to them
could then be allocated to less
wealthy orginizations? In other
words, why not take from the
rich and give to the poor?

That was the issue that came
in front of the Executive Com-
mittee last year. At budget
hearings this year, no mention
of it was made.

Some say there’s a definite
need for a Pub Board Reserve
Fund. ‘It’s a necessary re-
source,” insists Peter Cronin,
Pub Board secretary and Calyx
editor. Unless the EC will pro-
mise to come to the rescue of
the Calyx when financial
emergencies arise, the reserve
fund must be left intact, he said.

Pub Board President and
Ring-tum Phi Editor Rick
Swagler agrees that the reserve
fund is necessary. From the
Phi’s point of view, it’s essential
that the paper have a degree of
financial independence from
the EC. Without the reserve
fund, it would have to go begg-

ing to the EC for money. That
would then give the EC
‘leverage’ over the Phi,
Swagler said. Total control of
the purse strings by the EC
could damage the objectivity of
the Phi’s coverage. As Swagler
put it, ‘It’s awfully hard to be
critical of someone when you
have to go to them for your din-

‘Gimme gimme’ and the Christmas ghost

By MARKHAM S. PYLE

“Gloria in Excelsis Deo Et in
terra pax hominibus bonae
voluntatis.”’

December 6th is the feast day
of one Nicholas, Bishop of Myra
in the 4th century. St. Nicholas
was a good and godly man. He
lived in a subtropical climate.
He was an humble and self-
effacing servant of God.

Nowadays, of course, he is
known in a debased form as
Santa Claus, has been sent
north to live (surrounded by
aeronautically-minded _rein-
deer), and is the patron saint of
merchants and advertisers,
regardless of creed.

I will tell you how St. Nicholas
was picked for this role. In his
day in Asia Minor, there surviv-
ed a variety of barbaric cus-
toms. Many of the poorer folk
had had to sell themselves or
their children into slavery or

Criticism of Wilson refuted

inany opposed the change in
grading approved in 1982; and
we have argued over how to and
whether or not to regulate
fraternities ever since I got
here. Because there are so
many of us and because we are
such a diverse group fully
capable of shifting responsibili-
ty to others, ‘‘the faculty’’ can
withstand criticism easily. It is
a much more serious matter
when unfair criticisms are
leveled at individuals as has
happened with President
Wilson in some recent letters to
the Ring-tum Phi.

In the most recent instance, it
is alleged that President Wilson
is trying to change the calen-
dar. The calendar is under con-
sideration because.a number of
faculty members think other
calendars would be better
suited to meet the academic ob-

prostitution. One unfortunate

household was in worse straits
than most. The three daughters
of its unhappy head had no
chance of marriage, for they
had neither a dowry nor any
hope of one. No hope, that is, un-
til their bishop heard of their
plight. One cold night, he took
horse and rode out into the
bleak hills. He crept to a win-

My View

 

 

dow of sorts (the chimney

would have been a last resort)
and lobbed in three bags of gold.
No one could say where the
mysterious dowries came
from; but the girls were not
slow to use them. It was observ-
ed that the Bishop looked rather
thinner when he rose to read the

jectives of the college. They
raised this qtlestion in the
courses and degrees committee
which in turn voted by a large
majority in favor of
recommending that a study be
made. The President agreed to
honor this recommdation. He
appointed a committee chaired
by Dr. Wise who was selected
by President Wilson because of
his reputation for fair and un-
biased judgment. The commit-
tee is composed of students as
well as faculty members; it is
not a biased committee; and it
is currently making an honest
effort to evaluate the present
calendar and other options to it.

President Wilson has also
been criticized for expressing
some unfavorable opinions
about the operation of frater-
nities on the campus. He came
here without bias toward frater-
nities. He has simply stated in

Gospel at their wedding. And no
wonder; for the gold was his
allowance, and by giving it
away he had shot his household
budget for the year.

This sort of behavior is com-
monplace among saints. Just
one hundred years before, the
archdeacon of Rome, Law-
rence, had been martyred by
the tax collectors. They were
confiscating the property of the
Church, and demanded
Lawrence surrender’ the
treasury of the Roman see. But
that had already been li-
quidated. Not for fear of
Caesar. Rather, it had been con-
verted into cash and given to
the poor of the city. It was these
humble folk whom Lawrence
rounded up and brought before
the authorities. ‘These,’ he
smiled, ‘are the treasures of the
Church.” They beheaded him
for it, of course.

These saints are but two in

the millions of the noble army of
martyrs, some famed through-
out all lands, some known but to
God. They lived as they died
and died as they did according
to the example of their Master,
Christ Jesus, who, though in-
finite God, took on finited and
mortality, became mere man
for the express purpose of being
executed by torture; dying only
to rise again and blaze for all
other mere men a trail into
Heaven. These saints, in im-
itating Him, lived and died for
others.

That is what is wrong with the
falsifying of St. Nicholas’
character, with the profaning of
the glad Feast of the Incarna-
tion. The loud cry of “I want, I
want, gimme, gimme” drowns
out the choirs angelic. The
season has become a high
Saturnalia of greed.

This sort of self-centeredness
has gotten us in an awful mess.

The sounds of Christmas this
year — and not for the first time
— will be the crying of starving
children; the screams of in-
ternees in the Gulag; the sick-
ening shock of mortar fire. All
this because the Gospel has not
been preached in half the world
and has been twisted or discard-
ed in the other half. Things were
less barbarous in St. Nicholas’
day.

But hope dies not, though it
may sleep for a season. All
things which the world now
needs could be accomplished by
the abandonment of our slavery
to self. This is a season for giv-
ing to others. Let us begin doing
so, now. I am assured that
miracles would follow in the
wake of that commitment;
miracles like Peace and Justice
and the Joy of God. I hope you,
each of you, enjoy such mercies
this Christmas. God rest ye
merry. Amen.

 

he thinks that fraternities can
be improved, and he has inden-
tified some changes that he
thinks could lead to that im-
provement. He has no concern
about fraternities that is not
shared by many members of
the faculty, by many alumni
who were active members of
fraternities, and by - many
parents. The hope is that these
concerns will prompt a self ex-
amination and improvements
that will come from within the
fraternities themselves. There
are already some indications
that this is happening.

By far the most important
question facing us is coeduca-
tion. No change could have such
far-reaching consequences for
the college as this one. Presi-
dent Wilson did not bring this
question to Washington & Lee,
nor has he advocated a course

of action. The question has been
with us for more than a decade,
but the delimma it poses for us
has not been as clear in the past
as it is now becoming. Based on
the data now available to us, the
dilemma appears to be that we
must chose between maintain-
ing the high academic quality of
the college or preserving the
single-sex character of the stu-

dent body. If this is correct,
W&L will certainly change in
the future regardless of which
course of action is ultimately
selected.

Our Board of Trustees will
make that decision. They will
listen to what we, the faculty,
the students, the alumni, have

. to say. They will be impressed

by sound, well-reasoned argu-
ments. I suspect they will reject
frivolous and _ histrionic
arguments.

The debate is important; the
potential changes deserve our
most careful consideration. But
we must be careful in the pro-
cess to maintain another of our
most cherished traditions —
that of mutual respect among
the students, the faculty, and
the administration. We are for-
tunate indeed to have a Presi-
dent who is open, candid, and
honest in his discussions with
us. Few schools are so lucky. By
asking tough questions and by
giving us his unprejudiced
views he is a catalyst for our
self-examination. He is in a
sense holding a mirror up for us
to look into, but he is not respon-
sible for the problems we face
or the flaws we see.

Funding studied for
possible pavilion

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

The Executive Committee
may recommend to Stewart
Epley, university treasurer,
that the student activities fee be
increased to $100 next year.

The increase from this year’s
$70 fee would include a $5 fee so
the EC would have more funds
to distribute among the clubs
and $25 for a proposed pavilion
or pavilion-like structure.

A final recommendation by
the EC will be made next
month, President Bob Jenevein
told members during the EC’s
regular meeting Monday night.

In other action, the EC voted
not to pay for members of the
International Club to attend a
Mock United Nations in New
York and tabled action on the
continued existence of the
Political Review.

 

Reminder

A reminder about the class
schedule for the first week of
classes of the winter semester :

Classes begin on Tuesday,
Jan. 3.

Monday classes will meet on
Tuesday (Jan. 3). Tuesday
classes will meet on Wednes-
day; Wednesday classes on
Thursday; Thursday classes on
Friday; and, Friday classes on
Saturday.

 

 

President John Wilson, who’s
‘‘behind it and thinks it’s a good
idea,’’ according to Jenevein,
said the funds could be found.
Jenevein, however, said he told
Wilson ‘‘that I didn’t think that
would be a good precedent to
establish.’’

Other members of the com-
mittee said expenses for four
people to travel to New York
should not come out of student
taxes.

“T myself would be upset, let
alone the people who are paying
the taxes,” junior represen-
tative Darby Brower said.

Other students pay their own
way to conferences and conven-
tions, several members of the
committee noted.

“T’d rather have the commit-
tees banging on President
Wilson’s door than coming to
us,’’ Vice President Dave Judge
said.

Brower’s motion to leave
such funding up to Wilson’s
jurisdiction but to write him a
letter explaining the possible
precedent-setting problems of
his funding the trip passed
unanimously.

After only receiving $850 of its
requested $1,900 during budget
hearings, the Political Review
was told it might receive money
for a second issue if the first
were good.

Editor Mike Singer reported
Monday that the first issue only
cost $600 and requested $500 to
produce a second.

“Well...that’s nice...But I
think we ran out of money the
first time through,” upperclass
law representative Jim Green
responded.

“I think the Political Review
is really outstanding, especially
compared to last year’s
Political Review,” Jenevein
said.

Action on whether to grant .

the Political Review additional
funds was tabled until the EC’s
next meeting, Jan. 9, at which
time Judge will report on the
EC’s funding status.

The EC also tabled action on
whether to release a statement
supporting President Wilson,
who has come under much
criticism because such issues
as coeducation, spring term and
fraternities have again surfac-
ed.

“Personally, I’m sure that
John D. Wilson is thinking about
what is best for the school,”
Jenevein said. “I think it’s in
the best interests of W&L to
boost him and make people
realize he’s a good man.”’

Debate centered around
whether to release a statement
prepared by Green which de-
scribed Wilson as ‘...warm-
hearted...a gifted and conscien-
tious administrator.

“We applaud John D. Wilson
as President of this Universi-
e

Another, prepared by Jene-
vein, asked students to consider
Wilson’s academic and ad-
ministrative record and not to
let rumor affect their percep-
tion of him.

Action on the statements was
postponed until after Christmas
vacation.

 

 

With Your

The EC also heard budget
reports from:

—Contact, which spent $2,000
on John Stockwell and is in-
vestigating the possibility of
splitting expenses for a political
speaker with the Mock Conven-
tion.

—The Rugby Club, which
spent $390 during its fall season,

which it finished with a 3-5-1
record.

—The Ariel, which will
publish its first issue in
February.

The Student Bar Association
failed to appear to answer ques-
tions about its report, so the
SBA was rescheduled for Jan.
16.

 

College rating no
surprise to Wilson

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee Presi-
dent John D. Wilson said this
week that. he ‘‘wasn’t entirely
surprised” at W&L’s recent
first-place showing in a ranking
of smaller comprehensive
universities east of the
Mississippi River.

The list resulted from a
survey by U.S. News & World
Report of college presidents
whose institutions are in that
category.

“I would have been disap-
pointed if we weren’t ranked,”’
Wilson said.

He continued that ‘‘because of
the Law School, we were put in
this peculiar category, whereas
normally we would be thought
of as a ‘national liberal arts col-

 

lege.’ This threw us into a
curious bunch.”’

Wilson ranked the schools
much as they appeared in the
magazine. He put Washington
and Lee first, followed by Union
College, Lafayette College, Get-
tysburg College, and St.
Lawrence University.

He said he ranked W&L first
“without self-serving motives. I
really felt that way.”

Virginia Military Institute
was in the same category as
W&L. ‘I don’t think of VMI as a
comprehensive university,”’
Wilson said. ‘‘I think of VMI as
a military institution with a
unique character and style. I
found it impossible to rank.”’

Of W&L’s finish in the poll,
Wilson said, ‘‘It can’t but help
us. It’s good to be number one.”’

faculty what had happened dur-
ing Thursday’s University
Council meeting, when no ac-
tion was taken on the matter.

After that, though, Atwood
said, ‘‘There wasn’t much
discussion.

“What is there to discuss?”’

The plus-minus system,
which will add .33 points to a
grade for a plus and subtract .33
points for a minus, was approv-
ed by the University Council
and the faculty in April, 1982.

A compromise approved dur-
ing the UC meeting Thursday
stipulates that the UC would
suggest that the committee on
courses and degrees consider
allowing a student to graduate
if he would fail to achieve the
minimum grade point average
because of the plus-minus sys-
tem.

That proposal received
unanimous approval from the
20 UC members present. A
straw vote on whether this
should apply to just seniors or to
all three classes showed 17
members favoring seniors and
three, including Jenevein,
favoring all three classes.

During the UC meeting, Jene-
vein argued the students’ case
on the plus-minus by pointing
out the problems that might
arise with graduation re-
quirements and the inequities of
having the system affect all
classes simultaneously.

“The faculty is changing the
rules in the middle of the
game,” Jenevein said. ‘“‘two
students could get the same
grade numerically in the same
course (in different years), and
one would get a better or worse
grade.”

Atwood noted though that
having the system only affect
freshmen would require pro-
fessors to give two students in
the same class different grades.
“You’re asking me to give a
sophomore a higher grade than
a freshman?” he said.

Dean John questioned
whether the system should be

 

changed so late in the semester.
“Is it also fair to change the
rules in the middle of the game
because we started off this term
with the plus-minus system?”’
he asked.

Two student members to the
UC spoke out in favor of the
plus-minus system.

“‘T think a lot of students are
missing the boat,’’ senior UC
representative Paul Ziebert
said. ‘It’s up to us to get the
grades. The students can get
the plus if they put the time into
the class. It’s imperative to
keep in mind that we knew
about this at the beginning of
the year.”

Sophomore representative
Steve Losquadro said he agreed
with Ziebert. ‘‘I feel this helps
the hard-working student,” he
added. “It gives graduate
schools a more accurate
representation of the work a
student can do.”

Jenevein noted, though, that
the issue was not the value of

the plus-minus system but

rather whether the system

-should affect upperclassmen or

should be phased into effect.

Dr. Harlan Beckley originally
made the motion about the
graduation requirements, and
Jenevein seconded it, saying ‘‘I
think the students would be
more anpeased if the faculty
were to agree to look into the
nature of a graduate can-
didate’s performance to see if
his eligibility is affected by the
new grading system.

“T think that would answer a
lot of the problems the students
have with this.”’

After passage of that com-
promise and the straw vote on
whether just seniors should be
given special consideration, the
meeting was adjourned without
any action being taken on
whether plus-minus should af-
fect upperclassmen.

Jenevein said afterward that
he’d considered making a mo-
tion to that effect for the record
but decided there was no point
init.

City seeks to annex
more county land

The city of Lexington and
Rockbridge County clashed
Monday afternoon over the ci-
ty’s proposal to annex part of
the county.

The city, which presently
spans 2.48 miles, wants to more
than triple its size by annexing
another 6.86 square miles. City
officials say that there is a need
for the expansion because the
city tax base is shrinking while
the county tax base is growing.
The proposed annexation would
boost the city’s population,
which is presently 7,292, by
about 880 people.

Because the annexation
would undoubtably raise their
taxes, Rockbridge County mer-
chants, citizens and officials
are fighting the proposal.

The city is anticipating a
significant boost in their sales
tax income, which has dropped
about 16 percent in 11 years, by
absorbing some _ profitable
businesses in the county which
include Kroger, Rose’s, SuperX
Drugs, Sears, the Holiday Inn,
Woody Chevrolet, Long John
Silver’s Seafood Shoppe and the
Keydet-General Motel.

Read says drug grand
jury working hard

By DAVID W. JOHNSTON
Staff Reporter

A special grand jury in-
vestigating drug trafficking and
dealing in Lexington and Rock-
bridge County has already
generated over 1,000 pages of
testimony, according to Com-
monwealth’s Attorney Beverly
C. ‘‘John’”’ Read.

The grand jury, which was
formed shortly before the elec-
tions last month, was prompted
by a recent rash of drug-related
arrests and convictions, some
involving Washington and Lee
students.

The grand jury, which is
‘meeting every week, is taking
‘“‘an enormous amount of time,”
both in actual hearings and
“preparation of witnesses,”
Read said. Read said he could
not speculate whether or not the

ments or further action.

Robin Sensabaugh, a Lex-
ington man convicted as part of
the drug crackdown, has ap-
pealed his conviction because,
his lawyers say, the jury for the
trial, and the jury pool for
Rockbridge in general, did not
properly reflect the population
of the county. Current laws pro-
hibit most students at W&L and
VMI from serving on juries, and
Sensabaugh’s attorneys argue
this is unfair because students
make up a significant part of
the population.

Read said the appeal was
‘without merit’ because there
is ‘‘no basis for it.’’ He said he
did not expect the appeal to be

would not result in any changes

Death of sixties mourned in “The Big Chill’

Characters cling to their motivations through 20 years of change

By EDDIE CURRAN
Special to the Phi

In an article from “Rolling
Stone” magazine (Sept., 1982)
concerning the ‘60s genera-
tion,’’ Marcelle Clements
wrote, “Trying to recall the
spirit of a certain epoch is often
like describing a dream: it’s
easy to chronicle the events, but
almost impossible to charac-
terize the motivations.’’
Lawrence Kasdan’s new movie
The Big Chill examines the
motivations of the 60s genera-
tion — the impassioned
idealism, the anti-war move-
ment, the long hair — by
mourning their passing. The
characters in The Big Chill are
in their thirties, and have, at
least superficially, conformed
to society’s ways; and yet in
their college days at Michigan,
they were the radical students
who are, to us, the ‘‘60s genera-

 

tion.” College students of today,
who at the time were out play-
ing in the backyard, are as far
removed from our 60s prede-
cessors as from any other
previous generation — to us,
they’re just another slice of
Americana, pictured in Life
magazine compilations next to
50s motorcycle gangs and
marathon dancers from the 40s.
They were the ones who march-
ed on Washington and put
flowers in the rifles of the Na-
tional Guard, who grew their
hair long and first smoked pot,
who swore they’d never vote,
and who burned their draft
cards.

Yet the movie takes place in.

1983, and the 60s generation is
no longer isolated by their
politics or their appearance.
For a symbol, take Jerry
Ruben, who’s now on Wall
Street. Did they sell out? Did
they bite off more than they

could chew? Do their parents
say, ‘‘See how stupid you looked
back then” or ask ‘Did you get
that out of your system?”

Such is the emotional back-
drop of ‘‘The Big Chill.’’ Seven
college friends from the late
sixties reunite at the funeral of

away a promising career for
“the movement.’ As he was the
catalyst of their rebellious ac-
tivities, his death forces them to
come to grips with the motiva-
tions of their college days —
have they sold out, or are they
simply doing the best they can?

The entire movie takes place
in one weekend in South
Carolina and, lest I forget, is a
comedy. It is also one of the
most enjoyable movies of the
year for several reasons. First,

it was simply a good idea to cast
an all-star team of the hottest, .

most talented actors and ac-
tresses in the around-30 age set.
Among those present are
William Hurt (Altered States,
Body Heat), Kevin Kline
(Sophie’s Choice), Mary Kay
Place (Poltergeist), Marilu
Henner (Mary Hartman, Mary
Hartman), and Glen Close
(Garp’s mother). Secondly, the
soundtrack is vintage late 60s-
early 70s, with the Stones,

Smokey Robinson, Creedence.

Clearwater, Procul Harem, and
many other great groups from
the represented period. With all
this going for it, I was a little
suspicious that maybe they
might’ve written the script to
The Big Chill after they got the
cast and the soundtrack
together. But there is no
evidence of this in the movie
—the dialogue is crisp, where it
could have been pretentious. In
one scene they have all
gathered and get on the subject
of what they could have done to
prevent Alex’s suicide. As each
is articulate, they sort of take
turns theorizing on Alex, who
had lost touch with most of
them since college. Instead of
seeming like preconceived pro-
fundity, the moviegoer gets a
feeling of sitting in the same liv-
ing room with them, moving his
head in each direction as if at a
tennis match. Each character’s
speech seems to hold some form
of self-revelation and explana-
tion, the kind of excited, even
rambling rhetoric of sensitivity
that one would imagine coming
from these types of characters.
From the dialogue, we learn
something about each charac-
ter: William Hurt’s hardened
cynicism, or Glenn Close’s
guilt-tinged grief, (I use the
names of the actors, for it would
be too confusing to use their
character’s names. )

The two most memorable
characters were those of Hurt’s
and Jeff Goldblum’s. Hurt’s

character was the big stud in
college, then rendered impotent
by a war injury in Vietnam. He
reacts by anesthetizing himself
with drugs and cynicism, re-
taining the anti-societal pose of
the 60s but for all the wrong
reasons. He is kept alive by his
sense of humor and toughness,
and by movie’s end, he is the
one character who has precep-
tably grown from the weekend.
He gets together with Alex’s
young girlfriend, played by Meg
Tilly. She needs a father figure,
he needs to re-establish his
manhood, but even more than
that, he needs love. Their
uniting satisfies the moviegoer,
as Hurt is the most sympathetic
of the characters, and his sense
of a new beginning gives the
film a touchstone on which to
end.

Jeff Goldblum’s character
provides the comic highlights of
the movie, Goldblum appeared
several years ago in a short-
lived but critically acclaimed
TV detective show with Ben
Vereen. I imagine he’ll be seen
more in the future. His
character here is a reporter for
People magazine whose philos-
ophy is that all human behavior
is ultimately motivated by the
desire to get laid. He is a
pleasure seeker pure and sim-
ple, and is the first to expound
on his own lack of principles. In
one scene William Hurt offers
him a Quaalude, and he takes it,
what the hell. A little while later
we get a shot of him knocked out
on the couch, his mouth wide
open and his arm on the floor.
He has that rare face which is
funny on its own, and this is one
of the funniest scenes in any
movie this year.

While The Big Chill is a com-
dey, the sense of loss brought on
by Alex’s death is everpresent.
The movie succeeds because it
develops the feelings of its
characters and the changes in
their motivations since the 60s
in the context of this sense of
loss and self doubt. Their senses
of purpose now have a small
scope — instead of saving the
world, they have come to terms
with raising kids, developing
relationships — whatever it is
that they can do to make their
own lives fulfilling and pur-
poseful. And most importantly,
they have kept their sense of
humor. In the same article in
“Rolling Stone,’’ Clements
wrote this about her peers from
the 60s, and it applies to the
characters in The Big Chill
‘But they still had in common a
strange, enticing quality that I
can only describe as the quality
to disturb. This can be
manifested in subtle ways: in
the midst of a conversation, in
the course of the casual en-
counter, there is the sudden
bold remark, the audacious
twist. You look into these peo-
ple’s eyes and you think, ‘This

- person’s capable of anything.’.”’

X-mas album picks

By EDWIN BELL
Staff Reporter

Rolling Stones - “‘Under-

cover”’

The Stones at their best since
“Some Girls.” The Glimmer
Twins rail about their favorite
subjects — sex, violence and the
male ego.

Bob Dylan - ‘‘Infidels”’
The album is supposedly
Dylan’s comeback and does not
contain religious material like
“Shot of Love.” Reviews have
been very favorable. Produc-
tion and guitar is credited to
Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits.

Yes - “90125”

“Lonely Heart” is a great
single and the album is also
good. The original members of
the band are together except
Rick Wakeman and _ Steve
Howe. Although the single is dif-
ferent from any previous Yes
songs, the album is not. I don’t
know whether that’s a plus or a
minus.

Culture Club - ‘Colour by
Numbers’”’

Although many people hate
Boy George’s appearance, they
should listen to his music. Boy
George has a fine rhythm and
blues voice and the songs center
around this feature. The album
is a mix of reggae, soul, pop and
rhythm & blues. A very
listenable record.

Graham Parker - “The

Real McCaw”’

Reviewers praise this album
as the best record he’s made in
a long time, possibly since his
days with Rumour. The album
reflects his recent happiness
over his new marriage.

_ Invasion,

Big Country - “The
Crossing”
This band is probably the best

to come out of the recent British
excepting Culture
Club. The sound is a resurrec-
tion of the sixties’ emphasis on
guitars (thank god no syn-
thesizers). The musicians write
well and have performed as
studio musicians on Pete
Townshend’s solo albums.

Paul Simon - ‘‘Hearts and

Bones”’

The album started off as a
Simon & Garfunkel collabora-
tion inspired by their popular
reunion over the summer. But
it’s just as well that it remained
a Simon album because it is wit-
ty and mellow.

Billy Joel - ‘An Innocent

Man’”’

One of Joel’s Many genre
albums. (Sometimes I believe
he will outdo Linda Ronstadt.)
This one is a throwback to the
fifties. If you don’t buy this
album at least watch the video
for “Uptown Girl” with Christie
Brinkley. Joel’s next album is
due over Christmas as well.

U2 - ‘‘Live Under a Blood.

Red Sky”’

The best band ever to come
from Scotland, U2 is probably
the hottest band around. The
album. features live versions of
“I Will Follow,” ‘New Year’s
Day” and “Gloria.” I also
recommend that if you like U2,
make sure you purchase
“Boy,” anearlier album.

Michael

‘“‘Thriller’’
What can be said about this
album? It has sold 10 million

Jackson. -

copies (second to Fleetwood
Mac’s ‘‘Rumours”’) and has had
five top ten singles (the Beatles
only had seven from more than
one album). The man is a
genius and this ablum is
definitely a must for anyone
who likes music. If he would on-
ly stop singing duets with Paul
McCartney.

The Police -

chronicity”

Probably the Police’s most
commercial work and its No. 1
Status has proved this. It is also
interesting for Sting’s latest
view of the world and contains a
more assured sound than in the
past. The best cut is
Synchronicity II.

Linda Ronstadt - ‘“‘What’s

New”’

The album is a collection of
old tunes such as “I’ve Got a’
Crush On You” and “Watch
over Me.” The orchestra is led
by Nelson Riddle, famous for
his work on Frank Sinatra’s
records. The album is a great
gift for your mom or dad. It is
perfect to relax by.

Talking Heads - ‘‘Speak-
ing In Tongues”’

An album that has done well
because of its African rhythms
and funky backbeats. Also it is
the first ‘Talking Heads”
album anyone could unders-
tand.

*‘Syn-

James Ingram - “It’s

Your Night”’

Probably an unknown name
to most people, except Quincy
Jones’ fans. Ingram is an im-
mense talent, His vocals grace
such songs as “Just Once,”’ “100
Ways,”’ “Baby Come to Me,”

‘All the Right Moves’
has perfect formula

By CHARLIE ALCORN
Staff Reporter

If there was ever a movie
destined to make money hand
over fist, “All the Right Moves”
Should be considered. Script
writer Micheal Kane comes up
with the perfect formula. The
ingredients: a little sex, a little
high school football, a lot of
Stefan Djordjevic (Tom
Cruise), a teenage pregnancy,

liberal amounts of poverty, a
little more Tom Cruise and a
plot that leaves no high school
melodrama uncovered. In the
war for box office receipts, “All
the Right Moves” has the
(Cruise) missiles in its corner.

The movie itself is stylishly
done. The cinematography is
excellent, especially in showing
the decaying mill town of Am-
pipe, Pa., in all its Steel-gray
glory. The football footage is
true to life, although I tired of
viewing it through the monsoon
that seemed to hover over the
rural Pennsylvania football
fields.

Cruise, as well as the rest of
the football characters, did
creditable acting jobs. The best
acting involved the coach
(Craig T. Nelson), who is half

' drill sergeant, half psycho with

the kind of personality that
anybody vaguely associated
with aspiring coaches could
relate to.

Stefan’s girl, Lisa (Lea
Thompson) is fairly convincing
in her role as the future grocery
checker with the heart of gold.
Their syrupy romance left the
girls in the audience swooning
and the boys squeamish. Her
ability to stop Stefan’s back
seat spelunking at mid-thigh is
particularly praiseworthy. The
final sex scene between Stef and
she, however, is tepid at best.

_ (PG strikes again. )

The final analysis shows that
a perfectly predictable plot
leaves one perfectly bored, but I
feel obligated to tread lightly on
such All-American fare. So go
see the movie after you flag that
first final; it will make you wish
you were back in Ampipe with
Stefan and the boys.

Letters to the Editors

Student questions application of drug rule

To the Editors:

Since I last wrote on the
Honor System, my interest has
been aroused twice. The first
time occurred last Spring dur-
ing an Honor case. I will not, in-
deed, cannot, go into details.
The important aspect is this: A
student had been accused of
cheating, based on fairly con-
clusive evidence. The evidence
had been obtained from the ac-
cused by his accuser without
the owner’s knowledge — in
other words, stolen. Can
evidence that has been stolen be
admitted as evidence in an
Honor trial? This particular
question of the case was never
raised by either side.

The question obviously cuts
deeper into the Honor System
than it would in cases of illegal-
ly obtained evidence in court.
Since the question never came
up during the trial, an assump-
tion must be made that the E.C.
either failed to see it or con-
sidered it irrelevant.

The second case is more re-
cent. The E.C. has determined
that honor violations now in-
clude ‘lying, cheating, stealing,
& dealing.’ I do not want to ex-
plore or defend the morality of
drug dealing. Instead, I would
like to look closely at this par-
ticular decision in regard to the
entire system, and then draw
conclusions that I hope will con-
tain some amount of logic. Here
are the arguments:

Alcohol is a drug which can be
distributed illegally, as most of
us are aware. Many freshmen
are 18, therefore underage.
Distribution of alcohol to these
freshmen is illegal, as Don Jef-
frey noted last week. Thus do-
ing so implies dealing in illegal
drugs. (Need I point out possi-
ble ends derived from grain and
mixed drinks? ) Watch out, well-
meaning dorm counselors, frat
brothers, and overage friends!
When you are discovered mak-
ing a beer run, you are dishon-
orable. Likewise I suspect, by
precedent, that fraternity

A

presidents are held responsible
for underage drinking at par-
ties. Perhaps the E.C. might
clarify this.

One effect of this system of
honor will be an increase of
care taken by any active dealer
in drugs — or alcohol. Unfor-
tunately or fortunately, depend-
ing on your point of view, those
most likely to know who to turn
in — users — are unlikely to do
so. This will mean ignoring the
Honor System by whatever
percentage of our student body
uses illegal drugs or drinks
while under 18 for beer (21 for
everything else). This can hard-
ly benefit the system. Instead, it
must weaken the system by
burdening it with an amend-
ment as unenforceable as Pro-
hibition.

I am not sure the E.C. ex-
amined these chains of thought
before they made their deci-
sion. The ruling seems rash in
many ways. I am reminded of
the ‘‘Budget Amendment” that
appeared in Congress a year or
so ago. It was defeated because
Congress knew the difference
between everyday nitty-gritty
politics and legislation worthy
of adding to the great docu-
ment. The issue here likewise
seems blown out of proportion
when one realizes that murder,
unaggravated assault and rape
are now okay with the honor
system. With the definition of
one specific crime outside ‘ly-
ing, cheating and stealing’
comes the necessity of defining
all others as well. Why have
murder and rape, among
others, been omitted? All in all,
the hurried, rough feeling of
this addition points to unfor-
tunate motives.

There is still another chain of
ideas. When we all entered
W&L, the Honor System did not
include dealing. In fact, we all
signed cards to the effect that
we understood this and had
waded through a brief book on
the subject. Last week, the E.C.
polled us on the plus-minus
system. They found out that an

overwhelming majority of us
believe that we ought to play by
the rules of the catalogue we
entered under. If we apply this
same belief to the Honor
System, we find none of us
should be affected by this
change either. But this time in-
stead of affecting the faculty,
who ignored the survey, it af-

these days, in the Phi and

directions, clearly there’s a plot
and a man behind it all — some
Dark Lord or “Star Wars’
Emperor, waiting malevolently
in the shadows. To lay any
scrutiny of our little com-
monwealth — whether it be a
single-sex admissions policy,
certain aspects of fraternity
life, or the Spring Term — at the
doorstep of Washington Hall is
the easy way to dismiss it, to ob-
viate the need for careful
gathering of facts or responsi-
ble analysis.

Take Mr. Scott Mason’s col-
umn last week. The Spring
term, we are told, is the ‘“‘most
recent target” of John Wilson
the Boxer, who’s given to “hurl-
ing blows’’ at issues and at
students. This allegation that
President Wilson has master-
minded the study of the present
calendar is all the more surpris-
ing because Mr. Mason, unlike
some recent inventors of con-
spiracies, was in possession of
some of the relevant facts. He
knew that the Committee on
Courses and Degrees (which, he
neglected to mention, has two
student members) had voted by
a large margin to ask the presi-

might assume that it’s NEXT

An obvious counterargument
to this is that the change was
publicized in the Phi, as it was.
However, a change in the Honor

dent, so it is essential that every
student must be notified. Since

really think that a college presi-
dent in his first term would
countermand the request of the
faculty committee entrusted
with curricular matters?

Had he looked further, Mr.
Mason might have discovered
that the resurgence of faculty
interest in re-examining the
calendar followed right on the
heels of the study which has
given us new requirements in
general education. This is to be
expected. In the late 60s, calen-

EC rep explains
drug dealing rule

To the Editors:

I could easily understand
Donald Jeffrey’s reasoning
after I read his letter to the
Ring-tum Phi about the E.C.’s
decision on drug dealing, I felt
the necessity to write a letter
and explain my reasoning as I
feel he is very entitled to it.

Lying, cheating, and stealing
are stated in the White Book as
“clear examples of breaches of
the Honor System,” but im-
mediately following is includ-
ed: ‘‘The system applies to any
conduct considered dishonora-
ble by the student generation in-
volved.” The Executive Com-
mittee is comprised of
representatives of that student
generation. We unanimously
felt and truly believed to be
justified in the decision that
drug dealing may be considered
dishonorable. The Honor
System is to create an at-
mosphere of trust on campus

and in the community. As for
that reason, I believed along
with the other members, al-
though I cannot speak for them,
that it was in our jurisdiction.
As Mr. Jeffrey stated in his
letter, ‘...a drug entrepre-
neur... has only proven that he
is ungentlemanly and capable
of committing a very serious
violation of the law.’’
Ungentlemanly. I looked up
“gentleman” in the dictionary,
it said: a person of gentle birth
or status. I looked up ‘‘gentle’’
and found one of the definitions
to read: HONORABLE, DIS-
TINGUISHED; specif: of or
relating to the gentleman. I, as
did the other members, made
the assumption that students
like himself would feel drug

dealers to be ungentlemanly, or.

in a more relative term to the
Honor System — dishonorable.

Catholic U.

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Writer

Senior forward John Lee
Graves scored his 1000th career
point this week as the Generals
basketball team rolled over
Catholic last night and split two
games in the Ithaca College
Tournament over the weekend,
raising its record to 4-3.

In Warner Center last night
the Generals raised their ODAC
record to 2-0 with an 86-70 vic-
tory over the Cardinals (2-5, 1-2
in ODAC play). At Ithaca the
Generals lost the opener to the
hosts, 70-57, then came back
Sunday night to win the consola-
tion match against Lehman Col-
lege, 68-52.

Graves, in the meantime,

 

went over the 1000 mark with 41
points over the weekend, and
added 29 last night to move into
10th position on the all-time
scoring list with 1058 points. He
was honored with a game ball at
halftime last night to mark his
achievement.

Going into last night’s game,
head coach Verne Canfield’s
major worry concerned Catho-
lic’s style of play. The Cardinals
were averaging 87.1 points per
game, while giving up 89.5 per
game. Catholic’s 70 points last
night equaled the highest total
for a W&L opponent this season.

“We didn’t play the style of
game we wanted to play, and
that hurts,” said Canfield. ‘“‘But

from the floor in the 13-point
loss to Ithaca, a team Canfield
believes could become one
the best in the East. ‘We jus
could not find any consistency
against them,” said Canfield.
“Our offense did not play well,
so we had to change our defen-
sive style, and we couldn’t stay
with them.”

Against Lehman, however,
the Generals shot 63 percent
from the floor and came away

Canfield said. ‘John Lee, in

game on both ends of the court.

play of Lex Fitzenhagen, who

Grapplers win big,

fourth at Invitational | |

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
wrestling squad posted two im-
pressive victories and a fourth-
place finish in last weekend’s
W&L Invitational on their way
to a solid start to their 1983-84
season.

Last night the Generals
played host to Hampden-
Sydney. The grapplers drubbed
the Tigers 45-11. Pacing the
Generals on the night were
freshman John Lowe at 142 lbs.,
who worked for a third period
fall, and senior tri-captain Tim
Valliere, who dominated his op-
ponent at 167 and also gained a
pin. Sophomore Larry Anker
earned a victory in a well-
fought 8-7 decision at 150 lbs. In
all, the Generals lost just two
bouts in the ten weight divi-
sions.

The Generals easily out-
pointed Lynchburg, 36-14, last
week in Lynchburg. The team
then returned to Lexington to
host the 10th annual W&L In-
vitational Tournament. The
tournament was won by Divi-
sion I school VMI. (113 3/4
points). Second place belonged
to George Washington (66
points), also a Division I team,
with York (42 1/4 points)
finishing third and Washington
and Lee (36 points) fourth. Get-
tysburg finished
fifth, trailed by Hiram, Scran-
ton and Longwood. The fourth
place showing by the Generals
was their best in the history of

 

The subjects of this bird’s-eye view are Larry Anker and his op-

the tournament.

“That was a_ particularly
tough tournament by design,”
said head coach Gary Franke.
“We wrestled some very good
teams, including Division I VMI
and George Washington, as well
as some excellent Division III
teams. Still, I was very pleased
with the outcome.”

Franke was particularly
pleased with the performance
of two of his wrestlers in the
tournament. ‘‘Veterans Tim
Valliere and Jeff Dixon have
been outstanding. And some of
our younger wrestlers did very
well,” he stated.

Dixon, a junior, won the 190
lb. championship by defeating
Bobby Knarr of VMI in the
final, 5-3. Valliere, a senior cap-
tured second place honors, los-
ing only to VMI’s Steve Green in
the championship round of the
167 lb. class.

Other General grapplers who
performed well in the tourna-
ment were Brian Lifsted (118
lbs.), Jeff Mazza (126 lbs.), Tim
Walker (150 lIbs.); and Joe
O’Neill (177 lbs.).”” All captured
fourth place finishes at the In-
vitational.

fhe W&L wrestlers will
resume action after the holiday
break, when they travel to
Durham, N.C. to square-off
against the Duke University
Blue Devils on Saturday,
January 6. The squad will be
looking to avenge last year’s
loss to the Blue Devils, the
worst defeat ever for the
Generals.

division. )

Said the Generals’ tri-
captain, “I made it (All-
America) a goal but I forgot
about it over the years. It was a
real shock last week when
Coach Fallon told me.”’

The six-foot-two, 220-pound
center from Point Pleasant,
N.J., experienced his best year
at Washington and Lee this
year. As a captain, he offered
leadership both on and off the
field. His play was consistently
dominating.

According to head coach
Gary Fallon, ‘Glenn was a real
pleasure to have on our team.
He is an outstanding player who
has consistently improved
himself over the years, and he
is a tremendous leader.

“He is a real man in every
respect. He has earned this
reward — he worked for it —
and I’m extremely pleased to
see him get the recognition that
he deserves.”

Rarely a glamour position,
the center is pivotal in seeing
that the snaps to the quarter-
back, punter, and holder are
conducted smoothly. In addi-
tion, the center is the catalyst
for the offensive line, a key to a
strong running game.

“The success of our running
game and Gene Girard is due to
our offensive line, and Glenn is
certainly an instrumental part
of line,” commented Fallon.

Kirschner returned the
praise: ‘‘I’d like to give alot of
credit to Coach Fallon. He’s the

Senior tri-captain Glenn Kirschner at work in the trenches where
he earned his All-American standing. The center was the only

person who kept me at W&L
when I thought about transfer-
ring because I was sitting on the
bench. Also, the academics
here were tough for me and I
was eight hours away from
home.”

Things have changed now,
though. Kirschner, a _ jour-
nalism major, is applying to

several law schools in the
Boston area, discarding any
idea of going pro.

*‘No, I’m too small. To be pro-
size, I’d have to be 250-260
pounds and my frame will only
allow me to carry 220 pounds. I
think it’s better for me to bow
out with this honor.”

Professor defends Wilson

To the Editors:

I feel compelled to respond to
Scott Mason’s charges that
President Wilson has initiated a
move to abandon our current
12-126 calendar in favor of a 15-
week semester system.

The facts are as follows: Last
year I served as a member of
the Committee on Courses and
Degrees. During the year I
heard various faculty members
criticize the 12-12-46 calendar.
During a Spring meeting of the
Committee a quite different
issue led us into a discussion of
the Spring term. Two members
of the Committee expressed
strong reservations about our
current calendar. Since I had
heard such concerns from
faculty both inside and outside
the Committee and, since the
Committee was obviously going
to be preoccupied for the im-
mediate future with implement-
ing the General Education pro-
posals, I made a motion to
recommend to the President
that he appoint a special com-
mittee to consider the calendar.

That motion passed the Com-
mitee on Courses and Degrees
and President Wilson, quite pro-
perly, responded to the recom-
mendations by appointing the
Calendar Committee.

At no time did I consult with
President Wilson or have any
prior knowledge of his views on
the calendar. | do not know to
this day what he thinks of the
12-124. Moreover, he com-
mented to me during the sum-
mer that he was surprised by
the recommendation since he
had not heard the criticism I
had heard.

I might also volunteer that
my motion did not stem from
any opposition, on my part, to
the 12-12-6 calendar. On the con-
trary, I favor the Spring term
because I believe it has
facilitated the development of
our present very rich and
varied curriculum and I believe
a return to the semester system
would force a reduction in
course offerings which would be
to our detriment in an increas-
ingly competitive market place.

Nevertheless I do also believe it
is appropriate for the faculty to
evaluate the effectiveness of the
calendar periodically, and that
faculty in disciplines which can-
not make effective use of the
Spring term deserve an oppor-
tunity to air their objections and
to search for solutions to their

problems. I hope that the out-
come of this process will be a

For a long time there was no
need to dip into the reserve
fund. It just kept growing, col-
lecting dust waiting to be used.
Then came last spring and the
Calyx found itself $5,000 in in
the hole. It took from the
reserve fund which now stands
at about $4,000.

So the surplus cash that had
been rotting away in the till
finally got used after all, and

reaffirmation and, therefore, a
renewed commitment to a
calendar which will offer us the
advantages of the 12-12-46 and
also afford some solution to the
problems which it presents to
some.

I might add that I am not cur-
rently a member of either the

Committee on Courses and

Degrees or the Calendar Com-
mittee, Students who want
some input into the Calendar
Committee may consult.the two
students whom President
Wilson appointed to that Com-
mittee: Messrs. Robert Woods

what were considered financial-
ly fat organizations don’t seem
fat any more. Still it’ll be in-
teresting to see what happens at
next year’s budget hearing. If
The Ring-tum Phi doesn’t use
all the money the Executive
Committee gave it this year, as
the Phi has had a knack of doing
in the past, it could run into a
jam. Since the Phi isn’t using all
the money it’s been given, the
EC simply might decide to

reduce the amount it usually
gives them. A conflict arises
between ‘‘punishing’’ an
orginization for saving money
by being well-run and being
financially fair to struggling
orginizations and seeing that
they remain alive. If the EC
decides in the future to play
Scrooge and cut back the
paper’s budget, they’re likely to
be some bleak Christmases
ahead for The Ring-tum Phi.

 

 

Trustees ——

(continued from page 1)

Wilson said retiring trustee Jack Warner
has been ‘‘very generous to Washington
and Lee. He’s a man. of extraordinary
education and talent. He’s a man with
strong opinions who has the courage to

state them.”

Warner recently traveled the country on

behalf of W&L’s capital fund.

Frank Brooks, who began his term in.
1972, was, Wilson says, ‘‘a wonderful and
caring member of the Board...He’s as sen-
sitive and as thoughtful a man as one could

expect.

“He speaks with great affection of his
years at W&L, and continues to be of great
service to us by giving his counsel.”
called Sydney Lewis ‘‘a
monumental figure in the history of this
university and of philanthropy. His great
contributions to W&L are matched by his
equally generous gifts to many other social

Wilson

institutions.

‘He is a great, great man and a wonder-
ful friend.’’ Wilson and Lewis once served
together on the board of the Virginia Foun-

dation for the Humanities.

In a recent letter to retiring trustee
Waller Dudley, Wilson said he combines
“great intelligence and experience with

candor.”’

Wilson said he was “‘able to tell you
where you’re going to go wrong, and warn
you of potential difficulties. He is absolute-
ly focused on the well-being of this Univer-

sity.”

When asked if there was a recent exam-
ple of this warning of “potential dif-
ficulties,’ Wilson said, ‘‘He’s certainly
counseled with me on the coeducation
question and how that should be approach-
ed. He has great concern for W&L, and I

trust him implicitly.

“‘He’s mostly concerned with the pro-
cess, and concerned about the impression
of an accelerated timetable and judgment.

I dare not go any further...’’

Coed decision
to be delayed

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

Copyright 1984 by The Ring-tum Phi

In a shift from previous
statements, University Presi-
dent John D. Wilson is now vir-
tually certain that a decision
regarding undergraduate coed-
ucation at Washington and Lee
cannot be made by the end of
this academic year.

Both he and James M. Ballen-
gee, rector (chairman) of the
Board of Trustees, agree that a
judgment on the coeducation
question probably will be made
sometime during the summer.

“‘T do not now anticipate that
there will be a May decision by
the Board,” Wilson said after
returning from a Monday
meeting with Ballengee in
Philadelphia.

It had been said earlier that
the Board of Trustees would
discuss the issue at its Feb. 4
meeting and vote on it at the
May 26 meeting.

It is now expected that those
gatherings will be used to study
the problem, with a final deci-
sion coming at a special session
during the summer.

“On a subject of this impor-
tance, it’s pretty clear to me
that a special meeting will be
needed,” Ballengee said by
telephone on Tuesday.

“It would certainly be no
later than mid-summer, and I
would hope the issue could be
resolved then.”

“It’s a tremendously com-
plicated issue with many conse-
quences no matter which way it
comes out,” Ballengee said.
“We certainly don’t want to
drag the issue out. It’s impor-
tant to let people who are apply-
ing know what the policy will
be.”

“l’m hoping that no later than
summer, we can know enough
to make a decision,” Wilson
said last week. ‘It would be

enervating for the university to
have the matter suspended in-
definitely.”

The rector said that special
sessions of the Board are rare,
but that ‘‘it has been done on

special occasions.”’

He said that a date for the
mid-summer session will be set
“tentatively” at the February
meeting, and “firmly” in May.

He reiterated that he expects ‘‘a
resolution’ of the question at
that summer meeting.

Ballengee said that the areas
of study will be decided in the
winter, and that preliminary
reports will be given in the
spring. ‘‘We’ll discuss it every
time we meet,” he said.

‘“‘We’re pretty well agreed on
the major outline of the
February meeting,’ Wilson
said Tuesday. ‘‘One session of
the Board meeting will be set
aside for consideration of
coeducation.

“First, we will have a discus-
sion with staff of various
aspects of the coeducation
issue.

“Later, the Board will go into
executive session. Without staff
present, the Board will try to
come to an understanding of
what steps would be most ap-
propriate to pursue.”

Wilson said that Bob Jene-
vein, who, as President of the
Student Body, attends meetings
of the trustees, ‘‘will be invited
to remain when the Board goes
into executive session.’ Alumni
Board of -Directors President
Peter A. Agelasto III will also
attend that session.

It is impossible, Wilson says,
to ‘‘prejudge”’ what studies the
trustees will initiate, He said,
however, that “it will be the
rector’s intention to use the
standing committee structure”

Huntley leaves for Best post

Former University president departs law faculty

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

Robert E.R. Huntley, former
president of Washington and
Lee, has joined Best Products
Co., Inc., in Richmond in a
newly-created top admjnistra-
tive position.

Since January 2, Huntley, 54,
has served as a Best executive
vice president and as chief
operating officer of the catalog
showroom division.

The position, which is the
result of a recent corporate
restructuring, makes the 1950
Washington and Lee graduate
responsible for the retailing
firm’s 197 showrooms in 27
states.

Huntley has spent 12 years on
the Board of Directors of Best
Products, which was founded in
1957 by Sydney and Frances
Lewis.

Lewis, a 1940 W&L graduate,
served on the University’s
Board of Trustees until the end
of last year. At that time, his
wife was named to a post on the
Board.

The Lewises have been gener-
ous benefactors of Washington
and Lee. The law school
building is named in Mrs.
Lewis’ honor.

“It came as a surprise, ob-
viously, to me,” President John
D. Wilson said of Huntley’s new
position. ‘‘We’re going to miss
him here.

“‘He’s a young, vigorous cor-

porate lawyer who will bring a
great deal of talent and energy
to his new endeavor. He wanted
a new challenge, and | have a
great deal of sympathy for
that.’”’

Wilson said that the Lewises
had talked to Huntley about the
position when he left office, but
at the time he said such a
change would be ‘‘premature.”’
The Lewises, Wilson said, re-
newed the offer late last year.

Huntley is living in Richmond
during the week, and drives the
two-and-a-half hours back to
Lexington each weekend to join
his family, which will take up
residence in Richmond this
summer. His youngest daugh-
ter is a senior at Lexington High

Review and Outlook

 

 

Taking time

Of all the developments in the coeducation saga the
decision by President John D. Wilson and Board of
Trustees Rector James M. Ballengee not to vote on
the issue at the Trustees’ May meeting is perhaps the
most significant.

Although the issue of coeducation surfaced in a
Ring-tum Phi interview with President Wilson last
spring, the Board did not officially take up the ques-
tion until this past November. At that time Ballengee
said that he expected a vote in May. Up until this
latest development it seemed that this was the
timetable for voicing opinions and being heard.

This additional time will allow more voices to
emerge, especially from the alumni who seemed least
informed. Perhaps more importantly it will allow
people to free themselves from emotional reactions
and their initial reactions. In short there will be more
time for careful, considered thought. A decision af-
fecting a 235-year-old institution should not be made
ina matter of months.

We find it particularly reassuring to see that the
— is flexible enough to reconsider their previous
plans.

It is also essential for Student Body President Bob
Jenevein and Alumni Board of Directors President
Peter A. Agelasto to consider how they might best
represent their particular constituencies. It is equally
important for the students and alumni to make their
opinions known to their respective representatives.

There cannot be too much discussion as long as it is
informed, thoughtful and rational. It is necessary,
especially at this point for this intercourse to con-
tinue.

Cadavers:

Open discussion needed

Tothe Editors:

The members of the Cadaver
Society, both current students
and alumni, have noted with
some concern the manner in
which the issue of coeducation
is being discussed within the
Washington and Lee communi-
ty. Our particular concern is for
those members of the Universi-
ty community who are off cam-
pus and who therefore usually
do not have as immediate ac-
cess to information as do on-
campus students, faculty, staff
and members of the adminis-
tration. This lack of informa-
tion, of course, makes it ex-
tremely difficult to make a
reasonable decision on the
issue, and often has the effect of
making an alumnus susceptibie
to innuendo and rumor. Al-
though the Cadaver Society is
convinced that no member of
the Washington and Lee com-
munity would intentionally
mislead another membcr on
such a question as coeducation,
we fear that this will be the ef-
fect if the forum of discussion is
not broadened in the immediate
future.

The Society is pleased to note
the interview with President
Wilson on the issue of coeduca-
tion in the Nov. 3 issue of The
Ring-tum Phi. We are hopeful
that discussion of this issue will
proceed on the most open and

informed course as possible, a
course that the Society believes
is the only one appropriate for
members of the W&L communi-
ty.

Moreover, we wish to express
our hope that a decision to make
Washington and Lee a coeduca-
tional institution at the
undergraduate level — a deci-
sion which would, of course,
completely change the unique
character of the school — only
be made for the most compell-
ing reasons, While the member-
ship of Cadaver is actively sup-
portive of Washington and Lee,
we believe that before we can
support a move to coeducation,
all available studies must lead
to the unavoidable conclusion

EC erred in public honor policy statement

By BEN HALE
Phi Columnist

The Executive Committee’s
Nov. 14 decision to announce to
the public that selling drugs
could be considered an honor
violation was a grave mistake.
The decision was wrong over
and above the issue of whether
or not dealing is dishonorable.
The EC has no duty to announce
possible honor violations. In-
deed, it has a duty not to an-
nounce its views about honor.

To announce publicly that a
certain act may or may not be
considered dishonorable is to
violate the central procedural
theme of the Honor System.
That procedure not only in-
cludes confidentiality about the
particular case but confiden-
tiality about the entire honor

procedure. Announcing that
dealing drugs is dishonorable or
using drugs or rape or defacing
school property or drinking
under age or any of an infinite
number of construably dishon-
orable acts) is wrong and un-
necessary. The bottom line of
the Honor Code is that: “The
System applies to any conduct

Common

By NELSON PATTERSON
Staff Reporter

Despite the inability of the
Common Market to reach con-
sensus on the topic of
agriculture payments in
December, the European Com-
mon Market will not go the way
of the Zollverein of Germany of
the 1920s, according to history
professor J.D. Futch III. Futch
noted that despite past Euro-
pean attempts to achieve
economic and political unity
through the formation of
trading communities and politi-
cal governing bodies for part:
of the continent, the very fact
that the European Economic
Community has survived since
1957 is a good indication of its
ability to survive for at least
that long into the future.

The latest crisis of the Com-
mon Market came during the
Community’s December
meeting in Athens. With two-
thirds of its budget going
toward agricultural price sup-
ports and rebates for farmers in
the member countries, the
Common Market faces tremen-
dous financial catastrophe
whenever the topic of higher
supports arises. Such was the
December meeting.

The common agricultural
policy (CAP), which pays
farmers not to produce above a
given quantity, takes much of
its financial supports from the
British and West German tax-

considered dishonorable by the
student generation involved,”
(the “‘student generation” be-

ing represented by the EC, as.

the trustees of the honor
system). To specify particular
acts that may or may not fall
under the system is redundant;
all imaginable dishonorable
acts are covered by the code as
it is stated. With the honor code

My View

 

 

stated positively and open-
endedly. It is the students’
responsibility to ‘be honor-
able” rather than ‘‘not be
dishonorable.’’ Dishonor is
defined as it can only be
—through the circumstances
mitigating each individual
case. Theoretically a particular
EC could view bouncing checks
as dishonorable and the next EC
not. The important point here is
that the public’s general under-
standing and faith in the System

need not and should not be jaun-
diced or shaken by - explicit
knowledge of changing EC
views.

The EC does answer to the
student body (and the student
body only) through public
trials. But such open debate as
we’ve had lately about whether
the dealing announcement was
literally right or wrong
—whether dealing is or isn’t
dishonorable — should never
occur. The EC should not open
itself up to unnecessary debate
about its treatment of honor.
The EC should certainly not
participate in such open debate.
Freshman representative An-
drew Caruthers’ well-inten-
tioned defense in the paper of
the dealing decision should not
have been written. The EC does
not debate or explain to the
public about its views on honor.
EC members should restrict
their official statements about
honor to private sessions. Once
entrusted with the Honor Sys-
tem, an EC member is in a
sense in a “sacred’’ position
—he doesn’t air the Honor
System in the newspaper.

If in this particular case the
committee sees fit to convict

someone for selling drugs, that
person can appeal to the public;
here and only here do the EC’s
honor views become __ public
ousiness. The EC also does not
answer to administration or
faculty. Any pressure from
Washington Hall to make a
statement about dealing should
have been politely and respect-
fully ignored. The EC does not
operate by precedents either; it
is not in any way constricted on-
ly by the consciences of its
members. Last year’s an-
nouncement might better have
been followed this year with a
statement that this ‘‘student
generation” does not make
public honor statements outside
the official Honor Code. Without
operating on precedents, the on-
ly continuity between EC’s is
the printed Honor Code. Public
statements ‘‘on the side’
weaken the absoluteness of the
code, which is quite sufficient
as is.

Besides calling the EC to un-
necessary public questioning
and dabbling foolishly with the
already comprehensive code,
announcing publicly what may
or may not be considered
dishonorable is more than un-

Market can look to past in

payers. With British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher
and West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl both renowned for
their abilities to swing an ax
through budgets, talks of an in-
creased CAP budget met with
deserved ire. The group could
not come to a consensus and ad-

Europe. Many problems arise
with such aspirations.”

“There is a problem with not
speaking the same languages,’’
he noted. The December EEC
meeting was highlighted by
several chilly breakfast meet-
ings where Prime Minister
Thatcher and French Prime

in reference to the two world
wars. “‘Simply to be rescued is
to be put in an embarassing
situation. Needless to say, there
exists a comtemptuous at-
titutde by the French toward
the British.”’

“There exist other attitude
problems, also. The French

‘Unfortunately, the dream of a United States

of Europe has been relegated to flakes,

utopians and Napoleons.’

 

journed without issuing any
statement, the first time any
Common Market meeting has
adjourned as such in its history.
Talk in the European press
told of the impending collapse
of the trading partnership. Such
talk, however, does not ring
true in the ears of Futch.
‘Historically speaking,
anything could happen to the
Common Market,” Futch said.
“In considering the matter,
remember that the EEC was
hoped to be the first step toward
the political unification of
Europe, a United States of

Minister Francois Mitterand
said nothing to each other
because neither speaks the
other’s language.

The differences among
cultures and nationalistic
aspirations also arise.

“(French Prime Minister
Charles) deGaulle’s _na-
tionalism hurt the EEC in its
early days. There is, of course,
the strong antipathy of the
English by the French, though
this is quite intangible since the
French have been rescued by
the British two times in this cen-
tury in 1914 and 1940,” he noted,

note that spaghetti not only is
the national dish of of Italy, but
that it also resembles the
Italian national mind. Again to
the French, Spaniards refer to
maids kept at home,” Futch
said.

Such nationalistic differences
were not considered by the
pioneers of the modern Euro-
pean unification movement,
men like Italian Alcide
De’Gasperi, West German
Konrad Adenauer, or the
Frenchman Reubert Schuman.
These men, considered by
historians to be the fathers of

necessary, it is a huge step
toware a codified, legalistic
Honor System. One of the main
strengths of our Honor System
is its foundation upon ‘‘Honor,”’
not a network of dishonorable
acts. Honor systems that at-
tempt to specify dishonorable
acts and therefore ‘‘outline”’
Honor step into a bottomless
swamp. Honor isn’t a negative
concept. The University of
Virginia’s attempts to catalog
dishonorable acts — with
a list changing yearly —
make a joke of their honor
system. Being honorable be-
came an empty concept. Once
the EC succumbs to the need to
be specific and detailed, there is
no logical boundary (eg if deal-
ing, why not using and then why
not rape, etc.) Our EC should
not pass on to another EC this
dangerous need to codify.

I am not attempting to assail

_ our EC, I think it is doing an ad-

mirable job. (Besides, the deal-
ing mess was started by Ben-
nett Ross’s more experienced
EC, which should certainly
have known better.) I am mere-
ly pointing out a wrong step that
might be corrected — and not
repeated.

Crisis

the Common Market (The
“George Washingtons’’ of a new
group) never really figured the
factor of nationalism into the
equation.

Before these men, countless
others had struggled to see their
dreams of a unified Europe
come to fruition, Futch notes.
One nobleman of Hungarian
and Orietnal descent, Count
Coudenhove-Kalergi, spent
countless years after WWI on
the speaking circuit throughout
Europe stumping for a ‘‘United
States of Europe.’’ He was seen
by many of his time, Futch said,
as an “‘itinerant flake.”’

‘Unfortunately, the dream of
a United States of Europe has
been relegated to flakes, uto-
pians and Napoleons,” he
remarked.

Does Futch see the Common
Market being ruined in the near
future? No.

“There has been relative suc-
cess in both the Common
Market and NATO in that both
have survived as long as they
have. I expect that both will sur-
vive indefinitely. The wonder is
considering the brevity of inter-
national arrangements that
both have survived.”’

“The hope for a Union of
Europe is a utopian hope. In
post World War II Europe with
all its supra-nationalism, hopes
and dreams flourished. I’m
sure there may be some who
are tucked away in European
universities that hope for such a
Union, but I don’t think anyone
takes the notion seriously.’’

Former
students

sentenced

By DAVE JOHNSTON
Staff Reporter

Three former Washington
and Lee University students
who were convicted of drug
violations have received
suspended sentences and proba-
tion in Rockbridge County Cir-
cuit Court.

Thomas J. Rohrig, William L.
Dederick and Marc A. Ham
were all given - suspended

sentences and 10 years’ proba-
tion by Judge George E. Honts,
Ill.

Rohrig, who was suspended
from W&L for three years
because of his conviction, had
pleaded guilty to possessing

marijuana with intent to
distribute.

Ham had been convicted of il-
legally possessing cocaine.

Dederick was convicted of il-
legally possessing marijuana
and cocaine.

All three were convicted of
felonies and are no longer at-
tending the university.

Another W&L student charg-
ed with drug violations, Charles
Phillips, is currently awaiting
trial for possession of cocaine
with intent to distribute. A trial
date has not been set.

Youth charged with murder

By DAVE JOHNSTON
Staff Reporter

A 17-year-old Rockbridge
County youth has been charged
with the murder of a 70-year-old
woman, and the rape and
shooting of another woman liv-
ing with her.

According to an account by
Rockbridge County Sheriff S.M.
Reynolds, Lillian Shover was
killed in her U.S. 11 house at
about 2 a.m. Dec. 27 after the
youth broke into her house.
Reynolds said that after

shooting Miss Shover, the youth
raped her 30-year-old house-
guest and shot the guest in the
back of the head before leaving.
The woman, a relative of
Shover’s whose name has not
been released, was treated and
later released from an area
hospital.

The youth, a Rockbridge High
School ninth grader whose
name cannon be released be-
cause of his age, has been
charged with six counts, in-
cluding murder, rape, sodomy,
malicious wounding and bur-
glary, according to Reynolds.

The day after the incident
Commonwealth’s Attorney Bev-
erly C. “John” Read filed a mo-
tion seeking the youth’s trial as
an adult, which would move the
trial from Juvenile and
Domestic Relations Court to
Rockbridge County Circuit
Court.

Virginia’s laws provide for
the trial of a juvenile as an adult
in most felonies, including
cases of murder, rape and
burglary.

No date has been set for a
hearing on Read’s motion.

support for spring term

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

Faculty members generally
are in favor of keeping spring
term, according to a survey by
the student-faculty committee
studying possible changes in the
calendar.

‘The faculty seems to
somewhat favor the continua-
tion of the present system,”
said Dr. John Wise, chairman of
the committee.

The eight-professor, two-
student committee began
meeting in the fall and is in-

vestigating the possibility of
dropping the spring semester in
favor of two 15-week semesters
or some other calendar.

The faculty surveys were
completed in November, and
the committee has taken no fur-
ther definite action, according
to Wise.

“We are still examining the
replies from the faculty, Wise
added. ‘There is still quite a bit
of variation in the responses.’

Wise said the committee will
be meeting with several faculty
members who wished to discuss
the matter at further length

A student survey that had
been scheduled for December
has not yet been held.

The committee is expected to
make a report in the spring,
with faculty action on the mat
ter possibly coming next fall.

EC requests a fee increase

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

The Executive Committee
will recommend to the Board of
Trustees that the base student
activities fee be increased $5 to
$75 next year, with a further ad-
dition possible to finance the
proposed pavilion.

Dave Judge, EC vice presi-
dent made the recommendation
after reviewing general finan-
cial needs of the student
organizations for the 1984-85
school year. The $75 fee, which
still must be approved by the
trustees at its Feb. 3-4 meeting,
was recommended unanimous-

ly.

The proposed pavilion, which
also needs Board of Trustees
approval, will cost $250,000,
which the student body will be
able to borrow from the univer-

sity at a 9.5 percent interest
rate.

SAB Treasurer John Hay-
wood presented five repayment
plans to the EC Monday night.
The plans spanned 9, 10, 15, 20
and 25 years and would require
a per student annual cost rang-
ing from $15.42 over the 25-year
period to $24.37 over the nine-
year span.

terest rate was much better

elsewhere, recommended the
15-year plan, which would cost
each student $18.42 per year for
a total cost of $469,900.

That plan would give the stu-
dent government flexibility to
raise taxes for other needs,
Haywood said, and would not
put the student government too
much in debt. Also, he added,
the normal depreciation period
for any building is 15 years.

Without taking any definite
action, the EC, unanimously ap-
proved a ceiling of $25 per stu-
dent per year to pay for the
pavilion.

That charge would be added
onto the already-existing stu-
dent tax.

term. Huntley said the .144 dif-
ference was “probably not a
very significant falling off.”’

The Freshmen class ‘average
rose to 2.314 from the mid-term
average of 2.19.

A breakdown of departmental
grading showed that mathe-
matics courses were ‘“‘the ma-
jor villain, as usual,’’ Huntley
said. While this year’s
freshman had a slightly lower
average in math than the previ-
ous two freshman classes, they
did cope better than the current
seniors did as freshmen.

Although this year’s fresh-
men registered slightly lower in
their math, verbal and achieve-
ment scores than last year,
Huntley said he found “no
perceivable significant trends
or patterns,”’

Huntley said he did not know
what effect the new plus/minus
grading system might have
had.

Vlahoplus named Rhodes Scholar

John C. Vlahoplus, a 1983
graduate of Washington and
Lee, has been named a Rhodes
Scholar.

Viahoplus is one of 32 students
from throughout the nation
awarded the Rhodes Scholar-
ships, which sponsor study at
Oxford University in England
for up to three years.

Plus/minus
makes debut

By ERIC CAMPBELL
Staff Reporter

After the first term of grading
under the plus/minus system at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty, the new system seems to be
on the road toward acceptance.

In an informal poll conducted
for The Ring-tum Phi, the ma-
jority of students interviewed
felt the system will benefit the
students in the long run.

Don Richardson, a_ senior,
remarked, ‘‘In all it’s a better
system...it breaks things up bet-
ter. It’s more competitive.”’

A poll conducted earlier this
year by the Executive Commit-
tee showed 83 percent of the
sophomores, juniors and
seniors were opposed to the new
system.

Twenty-seven of the 50
students interviewed received
more minuses than pluses on
their fall grades. Twelve
students were unaffected by the
new system, and 11 students
received more pluses than
minuses.

A majority of the students felt
the system helped them even
though they received a minus
instead of a plus. These
students felt their grades were
in limbo between, for example,
aBoraC grade.

There was a _ consensus
among the students interviewed
that the hard-working student
would benefit from the new
system. Most students agreed

the professor has a much
greater ability to reward the
hard worker and not the less
diligent student without drop-
ping the grade a full letter.

Rand McClain, a_ senior,
voiced the opinion of quite a few
of the students interviewed. ‘1
don’t like the system at all.., but
in the long run it will all
average out.”’

Some students felt stronger
about the system. ‘‘I hate it...it
stinks. I would have made the
Dean’s List (3.0 grade-point
average) without it,” senior
Marty Bechtold said.

Dean Atwood, a strong sup-
porter of the new system and
president of the faculty, said he
was surprised when he took a
look at his final grade spread.

“I ended up giving out more
pluses than minuses,”’ he said.
‘‘T was surprised because, when
I figured out the overall G.P.A.
of all my grades, the new
system brought up that
average.”’

Another common opinion was
expressed by Alex Castelli, a
sophomore, ‘‘The new system
hurts people with As but it helps
people with Bs and Cs.”

Ricky Zahn, a sophomore,
summed up several students’
feelings rather well.

“I don’t like the. system, but
overall it is more important
what the faculty feels. They are
the ones giving the final
grades.’’

 

‘In all it’s a better system...

it breaks things up better.

It’s more competitive.’

IFC probes Pika incident

By JOHN CLEGHORN
Chief Editor

A decision concerning a
pledge-fraternity activity in-
volving Pi Kappa Alpha has
been remanded to the Inter-
fraternity Council Judicial
Board from the Student Affairs
Committee after new facts
about the ase arose at an SAC
meeting Wednesday. The SAC
decision to remand the judg-
ment followed an IFC Judicial
Board original ruling of two
weeks’ social probation last
Thursday

The activity at the center of
the ruling, which occurred in
early December, resulted in
medical attention for two
freshmen pledges; one for a
broken leg and a second for
severe intoxication.

One pledge suffered a broken

leg when he and a group of
pledges were cutting down a
Christmas tree. The freshman
broke his leg attempting to
dodge the tree as it fell, accord-
ing tosourccs.

In the second incident, an
Emergency Medical Service
team examined a freshman
after he returned from the
fraternity to his dormitory in a
severely intoxicated state.

The IFC is scheduled to meet
Tuesday, Jan. 17 to reconsider
the case with the new informa-
tion, the nature of which Dean
John did not disclose.

The SAC will consider the
IFC’s recommendation the
following day, Jan. 18, Dean
John said.

According to IFC President
Emery Ellinger, Pika has
already begun its two-week pro-
bation period despite the IFC’s
reconsideration of the case.

C denies IU tunds

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

“Unless you have something
tosay, I don’t think you’re going
to get a dime,” Executive Com-
mittee President Bob Jenevein
told Jim Sarle and Joe Cadle,
founders and chairmen of the
Independent Union, Monday
night.

Indeed, Sarle and Cadle
received none of their $623.40
request to fund the Independent
Union for the remainder of the
year.

‘“‘We have no money,” Sarle
said, adding that next
September the Independent
Union’s expenses may be added
to either Dean Mike Cappeto’s
or Dean Lewis John’s budget,
instead of the EC-controlled stu-
dent tax fund.

Despite the claims of lack of
money and high participation,
though, no motion was made to
grant the Independent Union
any money. Requests for funds
must be submitted to the EC a
week in advance.

Because the EC doesn’t give
any money to fraternities,
junior representative Darby
Brower said, “I would find it
impossible to give y'all any
money.”

Sarle pointed out that this
would just be one grant and
“then we’ll be off your back”
and added that fraternities
receive support from their na-
tional chapters and from the
university.

“What we’re asking for here
is the basic hardware that we
need to get this organization go-
ing,” Cadle said. “We need a
chance, if we want to get roll-
ing. We can’t continually go to

- for money.”’

The Independent Union’s re-
quest included money for fliers,
telephone, newsletters, sta-
tionery, stamps, a letter to in-

' coming freshmen and miscel-

laneous expenses.

“It seems like we’re creating
a second SAB,” freshman rep-
resentative Andrew Caruthers
charged.

Cadle and Sarle defended that
charge by noting that no student
taxes would be used to sponsor
social events. However, they
also admitted they had never
met with the SAB to discuss
combined social events, and, in
fact, the two organizations have
scheduled bands in the Cockpit
for both Friday and Saturday
night this week.

Cadle criticized the SAB by
saying, ‘‘They’re not doing their
job, in my personal opinion.”

Other members of the EC
said the Union should collect
some kind of dues before. re-
questing EC funds. Len
Howard, secretary and the lone
undergraduate independent on
the EC, said ‘‘I really think the
Independent Union would be
better off working strictly
among the independents.”’

Jenevein encouraged the
Union to work with the SAB and
to collect money from the in-
dependents.

In other monetary action
Monday night, the EC approved
unanimously a $500 addition to
the W&L Political Review
budget for publication of a se-
cond issue.

Reporting on the EC finances,
vice president Dave Judge said
$2,000 remained in the funding
account and $7,363 in the

     
     
   
     
  

463-3106

reserve account. ‘We seem to
be fairly strong in those two
areas financially,” he said.

The EC also scheduled a poll
on coeducation for Friday, Jan.
20. Jenevein reported that the
Board of Trustees would be tak-
ing a genera! survey of student
opinions about what students
think the general nature. of
Washington and Lee should
be.”’

Also Monday night, the EC:

— Voted to ask the faculty
committee on Courses and
Degrees to re-evaluate the allot-
ment of only one credit for Com-
puter Science 100.

— Formed a subcommittee to
investigate the possibility of
hiring a secretary — to be paid
for by the administration — for
student organizations.

— Heard a report from senior
representative Jim Messer on
the possible addition of lights in
the lower parking lot and along
Jefferson Street. Messer said
he’d talked to Mayor Charles
Phillips and that the item might
be on the agenda of a future City
Council meeting.

— Announced that interviews
for the position of Voting
Regulations Board chairman
will be held next Monday.

Law students pen
rights legislation

By MIKE HUDSON
Special to the Phi

As Mike Shaffer and Tom
Howell sweated out their fall-
term exams this month at
Washington and Lee University
Law School, they must have
drawn some comfort from the

' fact that they’ve already ac-

quired some experience in the
law. By writing it.

If the Virginia General
Assembly cooperates next year,
their draft legislation could
become state law.

Last summer as interns at
W&L’s Lewis Law Center, the
two Lexington residents helped
draft the Virginia Human
Rights Act. If approved by the
legislature, the act would
establish a nine-member Vir-
ginia Commission on Human
Rights.

The Virginia Advisory Com-
mittee to the U.S. Civil Rights
Commission asked the law cen-
ter to write the act, which con-

‘solidates federal and state

discrimination complaints.
Adding the existing federal
laws to Virginia law will ensure
that the federal goverment will
reimburse the state or local
goverments for any cases han-
dled by the Virginia commis-
sion or by local commissions,

- also provided for under the act.

Shaffer, Howell and Thomas
A. Rutherglen, a law professor
at the University of Virginia,
divided the duties of writing the
act three ways: Shaffer took the
section on enforcement and set-
ting up the commission; Howell
took the section on housing and
public accommodations; Ruth-
erglen took the section on em-
ployment practices.

Three W&L law professors
provided advice and supervi-
sion.

“It was a nice job for the sum-
mer,” Howell said. ‘Usually

law students don’t get much op-
portunity to have a hand in
anything as momentous as this
:.. Its great to be given a pro-
ject where you start with a
clean slate, and all of a sudden,
you call the shots about how you
want to put it together.”’

Writing the act began with a
month’s research on human
rights acts in more than 30 other
states and on a model act writ-
ten in 1966 by a national con-
ference on encouraging uniform
state laws.

The researchers also studied
legal challenges to the state
acts, which have been numer-
ous.
“A lot of other people have
been trying to clarify the laws,”’
Shaffer said. “It’s been good
that other cities and states have
been working on this. The ’70s
were a good time for civil rights
law.”’

In addition, they sought ad-
vice from the state advisory
committee, the Virginia Equal
Employment Opportunity Com-
mittee and members of Virgin-
ia’s only two local commissions
in Fairfax and Alexandria.

Three drafts have been writ-
ten. After a conference last
month in Richmond at which
several human rights groups
suggested changes, the act will
probably see even more revi-
sions either before or after it is
introduced in the - General
Assembly this winter.

“If the act gets its foot in the
door and actually gets serious
consideration from the General
Assembly, there are going to be
certain trade-offs,’ Howell
said.

Both students said they
thought the act’s chances for
approval were good. State Sen.
Douglas Hilder, D-Richmond,
has failed in earlier attempts to
create a state human rights
commission.

Huntley made the remark in the
fall of 1968 at his first Parents’
Weekend as president.

“T never heard him differ
from that view,” Parsons said.
‘“‘What he meant was that we
could not afford to go out of
business offering something
which was traditional yet
undesirable.’

“‘As long as Washington and
Lee could maintain a healthy

admissions environment and
good students. wanted to exer-
cise this alternative, there was
no need to change. But he
thought it would be regrettable
if a school of the character of
Washington and Lee went out of
business because no one wanted
tocome here.”’

Huntley said in the interview,
“It’s the kind of thing that has
to be thought about. That sim-
ply asks the question — it
doesn’t answer it.”’

He said he would not be in-
volved with any of the forth-
coming studies on undergradu-
ate coeducation. ‘I’m staying
away from that, as you might
imagine,” he said.

Wilson succeeded Huntley as
president last January. At the
time that Huntley announced
his resignation after a 15-year
tenure, he said ina statement:

“‘T have achieved as muchas I
can achieve. The achievements
that have occurred here are
quite strong and commendable.

It seems to me that it’s time for ‘

a new president.”’

James M. Ballengee, rector
of the Board of Trustees, said,
“It is my personal view that
President Huntley has been the
most outstanding president of
Washington and Lee since
Robert E. Lee.”’

After Wilson took office,
Huntley returned to the law
school, of which he once served
as dean.

This fall, he taught corporate
finance to 40 second and third-
year students, which he said
was “a very pleasant ex-
perience,”’

Law School Dean Frederic L.
Kirgis Jr. said that Huntley was
“very well received” as a pro-
fessor.

Word circulated this fall that
Huntley was being considered
as a Republican candidate to
oppose Congressman James
Olin of the 6th District in Nov.
1984.

Huntley quickly quashed the
rumors: ‘Politics and running
for office have not and do not in-
terest me,” he said at the time.

 

Wilson

(continued from page 1)

for this research into the
coeducation question.

The committees involved
would likely be academic af-
fairs, budget and audit, plan-
ning and development, and a
proposed university life com-
mittee.

Expected studies, Wilson
said, include effects on the
recruitment and admission of
students, a physical space in-
ventory, and further extension

of the demographic data to the
year 2000.

‘‘T will be very surprised if the
Board does not commission a
large survey of alumni and the
students,” Wilson said last
week.

“In the spring, they’ll be
seeking fuller responses, more
than a simple expression of sen-
timent about the question’ such
as that obtained earlier this
year in a poll by the Executive
Committee of the Student Body.

Wilson said the trustees’ ma-
jor task will be to get ‘‘as clear
an idea as possible of what
Washington and Lee truly is.
What is this university, in
essence?’’

He said they will also have to
determine ‘‘how the male condi-
tion affects the mission and
character of the university.”

That type of appraisal, Wilson
says, is the first step. More
specific studies will then follow.

“If you can get past the in-
tangibles — what impact it will
have on the Washington and Lee
experience, positive or negative
— these things can be quan-
tified,’ he said in December.

As an example, he cited the
cost of renovating or construct-
ing dormitories. He said that’s
not a critical matter, however.
“TJ have a feeling that, over
time, we should build more resi-
dence halls into our planning
anyway,” he said.

“That’s not associated with
coeducation. It’s part of my
conception of a residential set-
ting where we live and work
together.’”’

Because ‘“‘women don’t take
up any more space then men,”
Wilson said it’s possible that
“no physical developments’’
would be needed with a move to
undergraduate women.

However, citing ‘physical
education and playing fields,”’
the President said, ‘‘perhaps
that’s a little naive. I’m sure
we’ll find changes which will
have tobe made.”’

In preparation for the
February meeting, Wilson said
that the trustees will be sent
copies of letters he has received
from the faculty on the question

Architect restores London

Charmian Lacey presents slide lecture

By TED LeCLERQ
Staff Reporter

To those who spend time with
Charmian Lacey, it is impossi-
ble not to become engulfed in
her effervescent child-like love
of life. And like so many suc-
cessful professionals it is dif-
ficult to determine where her
funloving ends and her serious
attitude about her work begins.
Perhaps there is no difference.

In her position as London’s
superintending architect of
Special Services, Ms. Lacey has
breathed life through restora-
tion back into such aged, well
known buildings as Big Ben,

The House of Lords, Buck-
ingham Palace and Westmin-
ster as well as stuffy, creaking
castles across the foggy fields
of Great Britain.

In a slide lecture last Thurs-
day, sponsored by the W&L
department of fine arts and the
University Lecturers Commit-
tee, Ms. Lacey detailed the dif-
ficult but rewarding, relation-

Ship between the buildings and

her ‘‘clients’’ who inhabit them.
‘“‘The work that we do is com-
plex,” Ms. Lacey said. ‘‘In

terms of people, our buildings _

are occupied by very vocal,
knowledgeable, demanding and
sometimes important people.”

 

she contends. :

Although taking on such huge,
cavernous structures could in-
timidate an ordinary architect,
Ms. Lacey draws nothing but
satisfaction from tackling such
jobs.

“Sometimes these people who
occupy these buildings find that
they are inhibited by the
buildings themselves,’’ she
said. “It is part of our skill to
turn that from an inhibition to
an enrichment and a delight
and once one’s clients love their
buildings, our task is very much
simpler.”

Despite the exciting respon-
sibility of overseeing work on
the Crown Historic buildings in
London, Ms. Lacey feels her job
can become quite hectic with
some of her clients.

“There comes a moment
when you decide that patching
will no longer do.’’ Ms. Lacey
said. ‘Then you must get
together a great deal of money
and disrupt your clients for
several years.”’

‘*Yet the most important part
of our work — even though
some of the firms we deal with
don’t understand it at first — is
getting the restoration done
without attracting attention to
it,’ Ms. Lacey said.

In dealing with castles that
are hundreds of years old, Ms.
Lacey constantly encounters
problems of outdated archetec-
tural techniques and obsolete
building materials. In some
cases, deterioration of buildings
is not simply due to the ravages
ot time. She spoke of one castle
which required buttressing
after the second World War.

“The large series of six glass
domed building, which were
damaged by flying bombs in the
war, were designed by a Major
Halkes,” Ms. Lacey said. ‘‘Yet
the difficult part is that they
have gutters five-feet deep and
one-foot wide that need to be

cleaned out,” she continued.

“We haven’t got the money
yet, but we’re working towards
it,’”’ she said.

Ms. Lacey said one of her
most interesting projects has
been the recent restoration of
the House of Lords.

“They had put off letting us
have the building until a big
piece of the roof fell where they
would have been sitting. Lucki-
ly, they weren’t in session that
day,’’ she said.

‘‘The men who were restoring
the ceiling were puzzled at first
about what had caused it to give
way. They then discovered that
the weakness was caused by
great heat from. glass

chandeliers over 80 years ago.”’

Ms. Lacey said.
Although the cleaning of the

House of Lords displaced them

for several years, Ms. Lacey
noted interestingly that the re-
cent cleaning of Big Ben took
much less time.

While most professionals gain
self-motivation from _ the

Satisfaction of having their
work noticed, quite the opposite
is true for Ms. Lacey and her
crew of expert craftsmen and
architects.

“The object of our work, I
hope, is that no one sees what
we have done, but that it looks
very much better.”” Ms. Lacey
Said.

Film Society to show ‘Amarcord’

The Washington and Lee Film
Society will present ‘‘Amar-
cord” (Italy, 1974), directed by
Federico Fellini at 8 p.m. on
Friday, Jan. 13 and Saturday,
Jan. 14 in Classroom ‘‘A’”’ of
Lewis Hall in the Law School.

There is no charge for admis-
sion and the public is invited.
The film is in Italian, with
English subtitles.

Said by many to be Fellini’s
most accessible work, ‘‘Amar-
cord” is at once sentimental
and surreal. The story is based
upon the director’s recollec-
tions of growing up in a small
Italian town during the heyday
of Mussolini. To risk a stale
cliche, ‘‘Amarcord”’ is highly
spiced with both sugar and salt;
Fellini is not making a ‘‘sad”’
story or a “‘happy’’ story, but
one in which the viewer will find

varying degrees of those two ex-
tremes.

A translation of the film’s title
might be ‘I remember.”’
“Amarcord could have been
subtitled ‘‘A Year in the Life of
a Town and Some of Its Peo-
ple.” The town in which “Amar-
cord’ is set is similar to small
towns everywhere, even to our
own Lexington. The faces of the
characters may not be familiar,

 

but many of the personalities
will be. In all likelihood, the
viewer will be able to identify
with at least one of the charac-
ters, whether the connection be
in the past, the present, or in
one’s dreams.

“Amarcord”’ is a feast for the
eye and for the imagination and
the Film Society invites all
—Fellini fans and others — to
attend this marvelous presenta-
tion.

Trustee Emeritus dies

Mrs. Christine Hale Martin, a
trustee emeritus of Washington
& Lee, died Friday, December

16, at her home in
Gloucester, Virginia. Mrs. Mar-
tin was elected a trustee in 1978

and retired as trustee emeritus
in 1981.

A funeral service for Mrs.
Martin was held Monday, Dec.
19. Burial was in the cemetery
of Ware Episcopal Church in
Gloucester.

Stene sculpture and prints

in duPont this month

By SCOTT PRYSI
Staff Reporter

W&L professor Larry Stene is
showing a collection of his work
in sculpture and prints in the
duPont Gallery this month.

The exhibit includes 16 prints
and drawings and eleven mixed
media sculptures representing
Stene’s developments in style
and subject matter since he
came to Washington and Lee in
1982. The character of the show
is primarily bucolic with tones
of brown and orange com-
plementing natural materials
such as wood, cloth and twine.

Highly representative of
Stene’s work is the central
sculpture piece, ‘Red/Green
Shift,” 1984. This heavy pine
structure emphasizes contrasts
of color and form found in
nature. Alternating beams are
dyed red and green while the
whole piece rests askew in a
tense but inviting balance. The
subdued contrasting colors
mimic the autumn leaves, and
its massive size and precarious
position reflect the rural en-
vironment of the artist’s home
in Rockbridge County. His
abstract prints and drawings
also carry a pastoral theme
with the use of (natural) tones
and shapes. Together with the
sculpture pieces they show an
interesting development over
time of his intellectual and
visual themes.

Professor Stene has taught
sculpture and print-making at
W&L for the past year and a
half since joining the faculty in
the fall of 1982. This is the first
exhibition of his work in Rock-
bridge County and it will re-
main in the Gallery through the
27th of January.

He has noted that, unlike the
independent artist who works
within an open time schedule,
the ‘“‘artist-educator’’ must
create in “chopped up” time
segments.

According to Stene, such
scarcity of ‘‘pure time” causes
him to work in a faster manner
that is more responsive to basic
materials. That, he adds, re-
quires ‘“‘the courage to be im-
perfect” — a willingness to ex-
periment and ‘rely on one’s
own innate skills, judgment and
wit to produce work under the
constraints of the profession.”

A native of Minnesota, Stene
received his bachelor’s degree
from Moorhead State College
and his master’s from the
University of Illinois.

He was assistant professor in
the art department of Bemidji
State University in Minnesota
prior to joining the W&L faculty
as assistant professor of art in
1982. His work is represented in
the Cooley Collection in Peoria,
Ill, and in private collections in
Minnesota, Illinois and
Virginia.

Theatre plans six
winter productions

By BOB BRYANT
Staff Reporter

Six student-directed produc-
tions will be offered this winter
by the Washington and Lee
drama department, including
one play that doesn’t even have
a title yet.

The untitled play, which will
be directed by senior Bob
Ferguson and is being written
by senior Ted Petrides, will be
performed in the Boiler Room
Theatre Feb. 3-8. Set in a
Virginia juvenile detention
home, the play focuses on the
victimization and social label-
ling of minors in the correction
system. Petrides has done ex-
tensive research on the subject,
and has worked as a volunteer
in a juvenile home in Rock-
bridge County.

Petrides will take the script
directly from improvisations
performed by the cast.

“It’s a very natural process
within theatre work, but uncom-
mon at W&L in the last several
years,” he said. The players are
“doing everything a playwright
has to do in order to write a
play,” he said.

Two one-act plays, Woody
Allen’s ‘“‘Death Knocks” and

“The Informer’ by Bertold
Brecht, will be performed Feb.
8 and 9 at the Troubador
Theatre as part of Dr. Albert
Gordon’s directing class. Brian
O’Riordan, a junior, will direct
“Death Knocks,” a play in
which he says ‘‘Allen is reduc-
ing death to a comic situation:
two old Jewish men playing gin
rummy.”

Junior Chris Lillja says he
chose to direct ‘‘The Informer’
because it’s 1984. There is an in-
creasing amount of personal
surveillance by the government
and others. Brecht gives us a
warning that is as clear today
as it was in Germany during the
late 30’s: ‘‘No one is safe.”

The two other members of the
directing class, Larry Butler
and George Weatherly, will pre-
sent their one-acts March 28
and 29 in the Boiler Room.

The other major production of
the winter term will be Ten-
nessee Williams’ ‘“‘Cat on a Hot
Tin Roof,” which will run
March 23-28 at the Troubador.
Drew Perkins, a senior, will
direct. Auditions are open to the
public and will be held Jan. 18
and 19 at the Troubador.

Generals take Tournament title

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

After a 1-1 West Coast road
trip over Christmas break,
the Generals’ basketball team
returned to Warner Center last
weekend and captured the W&L
Invitational Tournament, rais-
ing the team’s record to7-4.

In California on Dec. 20, W&L
defeated the College of Notre
Dame, 58-46. Senior forward
John Lee Graves led the Gener-
als with 14 points, followed by
junior guard Lex Fitzenhagen

with 13.
Two days later the Generals

bowed to Stanislaus State, 88-79.
Graves again led the team with
a career-high 32 points.

“We got a great deal out of
the trip, besides playing two
good basketball teams,’’ said
head coach Verne Canfield.
‘“‘We were exposed to some
outstanding competition.
Stanislaus State was an ex-
cellent team. They play basical-
ly a Division II schedule.”

After a week’s rest and a
week’s practice, the Generals
hosted the W&L Invitational,
which Canfield called ‘‘the
strongest tournament that W&L
has had in my 20 years here. All

three teams that are coming in ©

are proven entities — none is a
patsy — so we will have our
hands full.”

Against Dickinson College
Friday night, the Generals fell
behind 14-6 after six minutes,

 

_day night. The Generals tri-

then closed the half outscoring
the Red Devils 24-6 for a 30-20
halftime lead. W&L never look-
ed back in the second half and
won going away, 64-48.

The game’s statistics reveal a
classic Canfield coaching job.

A tough W&L defense held
Dickinson’s Ted Kirkpatrick,
who averages 22.3 points per
game this season, to eight. No
Red Devil scored in double
figures.

W&L’s deliberate offense pro-
duced 52 percent shooting to
Dickinson’s 48 percent. But
more important, the Generals
went to the free throw line 24
times, hitting 18. By contrast,
Dickinson was four of 12. The
Generals are 73 percent from
the line this season.

Typical of the Generals’ of-
fense was the last play of the
first half. Junior forward Scott
Shannon ripped down one of his
five rebounds and passed to
playmaker Chris Baldwin, who
brought the ball up court. The
Generals passed it around,
waiting for the last shot, then
passed the ball inside to
Graves, who tossed in an 8-foot,
one-handed jumper from the
left side to end the half.

Graves and Fitzenhagen
again led the Generals, with 20
and 13 points, respectively.

In the championship game
Saturday night, the Generals
met Salisbury State, 101-89 win-
ners over Geneva College Fri-

Generais Lex Fitzenhagen and Scott Shannon (54) fight for a re-
bound in the early going against Dickinson, (Photo by Patrick

umphed, 66-60, to win the tour-
nament.

Again the Generals won it at
the free-throw line. Outshot 52

' percent to 47 percent and out re-

bounded 33 to 31, W&L relied on
24 of 34 free-throw shooting to
win. Fitzenhagen, with 14
points, was 10 of 13 from the
line.

By drawing 30 personal fouls,
the Generals limited the Sea
Gulls offensively. Dave Prit-
chett, who had 17 points for
Salisbury against Geneva, foul-
ed out with two points against
W&L.

Graves, averaging 20.2 points
per game this season, was out-
standing, with game-highs of 18
points and 12 rebounds. His ef-
forts earned him tournament
VMP honors.

Joining Graves on the all-

tournament team was fellow co-
captain Baldwin, with eight
assists, seven steals and only
one turnover.

“I was especially happy to
see Baldwin make the _all-
tournament team,” said Can-
field. ‘‘He does not score many
points, but his contributions in
other areas are just as impor-
tant in helping the team win.”’

‘We still have some things to
work on — most notably our
defense — but I’m pleased we
won,” he added. “‘It is impor-
tant to win our own tournament
and the win will help prepare us
for the upcoming ODAC portion
of our schedule.”’

Tonight at 7:30 in Warner
Center the Generals take on
Emory and Henry in the first of
14 ODAC games ina row.

“We are getting close to the
point where I want to be now,”’
said Canfield. ‘‘When we can
make people play our style of
basketball, we should be able to
‘win. Salisbury came into the
game with a high-scoring of-
fense, but we were successful in
making them play at our tem-
po.”
Emory and Henry, 5-19 last
year and 1-8 so far this season,
is led by freshman forward
Kevin Brown, a 59 percent
shooter averaging 17.2 points
per game.

Canfield is not taking the
Wasps lightly, despite their
poor record. ‘‘They have some
great individual talent, so we
must be ready,” said Canfield.
‘Emory and Henry is the prime
example of a team that will be
up for us.”’

everyone’s full of questions:
Why not Auburn? Why not a
playoff? Well, let’s face it,
given the bowl system, no one
team deserved sole possession
of any national championship.
There were at least four very
good football teams this year,
as well as a few others who’d be
willing to give those top four
trouble. Logic seems to be say-
ing, then, “Hey, dummy, how
about a playoff?” I’ll admit it
looks good on the chalkboard.
But, that’s as far as it goes. For
one thing, the bowl games are
too firmly entrenched to be
bypassed for a national playoff.

Although they have yet to play a

Generals have been most profi-

playoff system would, you can
bet, require a bit more com-
promising than the planning
committees in Pasadena, New
Orleans, Dallas or Miami are
willing to consent to. Finally, in
a playoff system you’ll run into
problems with the number of
teams selected and how you
select them. Do you pick the top
eight? Sixteen? What’s the dif-
ference between team 16 and
17? How do you keep that
number down? (Just look at the

’ basketball tournament whose

size has doubled in five years. )
And if you have a tournament
format, what precludes the
possibility of a lower team
upsetting everyone to win the
championship? Can they then
be justified as national cham-
pions, despite others who have
better records? No, I think the
present setup is best. It’s simp-
ly the only practical choice. The
problem today is that we’ve
forgotten what a bowl game is
for. It’s time we return the bow]
game to its original place.
That’s as a reward for a job well
done rather than an extraneous
test of a good team’s worthi-
ness...

...Back down to the Colon-
nade, there’s a group that is
almost always overlooked that
deserves some of your atten-
tion. It’s the boys over at
Twombly Pool. Coaches
Remillard and Newcomb have
produced another fine team
that works extremely hard and
is reaping every benefit it
deserves. The only thing that
could slow this bunch down is if

are at least three left — losing...
It seems Bowie Kuhn, as he

Rock, freshmen
lead swimmers

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
University swim team lost a
close meet against Ship-
pensburg State by a score of
58-55 last Sunday night at the Cy
Twombly Pool.

The Generals held a slim lead
going into the final event: the
400-yard freestyle relay. Ship-
pensburg State (ranked sixth in
NCAA Division II) won the 400
free relay by four-tenths of a se-
cond, and as a result gained the
points necessary to win the
meet, The loss gives the
Generals a 1-2 record in dual
meet competition.

Freshman Jay ReVille led
W&L against Shippensburg
State with three individual vic-
tories. ReVille took first place
in the 200-yard individual
medley (2:02.71), the 200-yard
backstroke™(2: 19.12). ReVille is
undefeated in nine races in dual
meet competition.

In addition to ReVille, senior
Tim Rock and freshman Joe
Donovan have also contributed
outstanding individual perfor-
mances to the Generals this
season.

Rock has posted the fastest
time in NCAA Division III for
the 1000-yard freestyle

(10:09.72) so far this season.

According to head swimming
coach Page Remillard,
Donovan, who posted two diving
wins against Shippensburg
State Sunday night, has col-
lected the first diving victories
for W&L in five years.

The Generals’ 1-2 dual meet
record is deceptive. The
Generals’ have lost’ only to
powerhouses in their respective
divisions (Johns Hopkins and
Shippensburg State). The re-
mainder of the Generals’
schedule is also difficult
however. The only teams that
remain on W&L’s 1983-84
schedule are in NCAA Division
i,

Commenting on the Generals’
schedule, Coach Remillard
stated that the team’s goal this
season is to go over the .500
mark against Division I teams.
Remillard said, ‘‘We’ve got our
work cut out for us, but I know
these guys are going to see to it
that it takes place.”

The Generals continue their
schedule this weekend. They
travel to James Madison
University tomorrow night. On
Saturday the Generals will be at
Towson State for a tri-meet that
involves W&L, Towson State
and Loyola.

‘Duke defeats matmen, 35-7

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
University wrestling team,
perhaps feeling the effects of
the layoff over the Christmas
holidays, suffered its first dual
meet loss of the season at the
hands of Duke University on
Saturday.

General grapplers lost the
meet by a 35-7 count, leaving

each winning his match. Valli-
ere now sports an overall
record of 5-1, while Dixon’s
record remained unblemished
at6-0.

Head coach Gary Franke was
pleased with the performances
of Valliere and Dixon but was

slightly disappointed with the

remainder of the team.

“‘We were a little rusty after
not wrestling for a couple of
weeks,’’ Franke said. “Valliere

mances out of some other peo-
ple.”

The Generals have a quad-
meet on Saturday, Jan 14, with
Loyola, Johns Hopkins and
Hampden-Sydney. Coach
Franke feels this is a pivotal
meet for his team.

“I cannot be too disappointed
with our loss to Duke, but I
would like to see us get back on
track this weekend. We will

Wilson

(continued from page 10)
of coeducation, and possibly the
letters he has received from the
17-member Alumni Board of
Directors.

‘I don’t anticipate, but do not
preclude,’ that any other
material on coeducation will be
sent to the trustees before the
Feb. 3-4meeting, Wilsonsaid.

The key expression of Wil-
son’s opinion on this matter is a
20-page, 6000-word document
which is often referred to as the
‘White Paper.”

A confidential copy of the
report dated Oct. 19 was sent to
the 38 trustees and trustees
emeriti at the time of the Oc-
tober Board meeting.

A slightly different version,
dated Oct. 25 and titled ‘‘Reflec-
tions on the Question of Under-
graduate Coeducation at Wash-

“Dr. Wilson, in preparing his
White Paper, attempted to deal
with the matter of coeducation
in as objective a manner as
possible. That notwithstanding,
it is possible that it leads one to
the conclusion or at least in the
direction that he favors coedu-
cation,” he said.

Parsons said that a number of
alumni have written ‘seeking
to counter what they perceive
as the bias in the President’s

paper.”

He added, ‘‘We’ve seen
several indications that some

_ alumni are encouraging others

to write.”’ He said this can be
seen from ‘certain turns of
phrases which keep cropping
up” and from geographical
regions.

 

‘There's a lot of people who want

to be heard on this issu.’

 

ington and Lee,” was sent first
to the faculty and Alumni Board
of Directors.

Shortly thereafter, copies
were distributed to alumni
chapter presidents, class

agents, the 60 Alumni Admis-
sions Program chairmen, and
officials of five nearby colleges.

On Oct. 27, the paper was sent
to the 12 members of the Stu-
dent Body Executive Commit-
tee and to the six head dor-
mitory counselors.

Wilson said that the head
dorm counselors were included
at the suggestion of Dean of
Students Lewis G. John in order
to seek opinion from indepen-
dent students, since the EC is
perceived as being fraternity-
dominated.

A check of records shows that
nine of the 10 undergraduate
members of the EC are in
fraternities; half of the dorm
counselors are in houses.

All were asked for their
response to what Wilson calls
“the Reflections.’’ ‘‘I haven’t
had many letters yet,” he said
Tuesday, putting the number of
student leaders responding at
three or four.

The students received with
the report a cover letter signed
by President Wilson which said
the White Paper was “a
privileged document”’ and that
“wider circulation is not war-
ranted at this time.”’

The report was not available
to the press and public until ear-
ly December, when the full text
was published in ‘‘W&L,’’ the
alumni magazine.

University editor Frank Par
sons says that the paper may be
‘“‘weighted.”” He said, ‘In
response to the White Paper
we’ve had a number of people
say that it has a slight — some
would say not so slight — bias in
the direction of coeducation.”’

Parsons said that the January
magazine will carry ‘‘an ar-
ticulate argument” against
coeducation by trustee
emeritus Jack W. Warner of
Tuscaloosa, Ala., whom Par-
sons characterizes as ‘‘the
leader of the status quo forces.”’

“Since responsible people can
have different points of view, I
think we ought to present those
views in the magazine,” he
said. He added that War-
ner’s ‘knowledge and _ his
feeling about the university are
deeply held, and respected by
those who know him. On his own
initiative, he has shared his
views with his fellow trustees
and other alumni leaders and
his statement is one we felt that
we should present to the entire

alumni constituency.”
Wilson wrote ‘the White
Paper’ during the Alumni

Leadership Conference in Oc-
tober.

During a series of three inter-
views immediately before and
just after Christmas, Wilson
continually maintained that he
had not reached a final decision
on the coeducation question.

The report, he said, ‘‘should
not be construed to be the con-
cluding sense of my mind on the
matter.”

He characterized the
arguments on each side of the
debate as ‘“‘equally compel-
ling,’ and said that further
study was required.

The report mentions an inter-
view he did in October in front
of Lee Chapel with correspon-
dent Lem Tucker of CBS News.

Tucker and producer David
Caravella are on the road with
the Glenn campaign and could
not be reached.

A Washington spokesman for
“The CBS Evening News’”’ said
that the tape is ‘‘still in the
file,’ and could air at some

future time.

The decision to let the coedca-
tion question extend beyond
May isa new development.

An October article in the
Newport News Daily Press
quoted Wilson as saying: ‘I
want to put the question of
coeducation to rest by May
—one way or another.”

In. a December interview,
Wilson said he had begun to
realize that that might not be
possible.

He said he had told a meeting
of the Alumni Association
ez lier that year that a decision
w Juld be made by May.

‘‘T had hoped we would have a
quiet time in the next year so
that we could reach a ‘yes’ or
‘no’ decision by May, which was
then a year down the road,”’ he
said.

‘Now I don’t know whether
that’s still possible or desirable.
There’s a lot of people who want
to be heard on this issue.”’

Rector Ballengee said in a
December interview: ‘I had
hoped we would be able to de-
cide in May...It shouldn’t be left
hanging up there, but we
haven’t concluded exactly how
the agenda will proceed...Pro-
cedure could be very important
here.”’

Wilson apparently did not
originally plan to have the ad-
mission of women as one of the
items on his agenda as universi-
ty president.

At a press conference on Sept.
1, 1982, the day he was named to
succeed Robert E. R. Huntley,
Wilson said that coeducation
had ‘“‘passed out of the realm of
something we have to worry im-
mediately about or think im-
mediately about.

“This university has been
able to attract, it continues to be
able to attract first-rate
students, and retain them, and
to educate them to become suc-
cessful citizens of the larger
world, and that seems to me to
be a useful mission...

“IT would say this: that we
would not be in the position of
advocating change at this
stage. I will not argue with the
Board that we ought to con-
tradict success,’’ he told the
reporters gathered in the Com-
merce School.

Coeducation as an agenda
item has occurred principally
this year. As late as June of last
year Dean of Students Lewis
John told the Christian Science
Monitor:

‘For the time being, we have
chosen to remain single-sex for
essentially two reasons: there
was no compelling need to go
coeducational, and we continue
to attract the students we
need...

“We think Washington and
Lee is a unique institution for
many reasons — its history, its
traditions. Single-sex is only
one of them. For now, as long as
the market holds, there is no
reason to change that,” John
said. :

EC to vote on exam policy

Committee also defends policy on withdrawls

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

Washington and Lee students
will be able to take exams dur-
ing any exam period without
specifying a day and time on
their exam envelopes if a pro-
posal presented at Monday
night’s Executive Committee
meeting is approved by the
faculty.

Junior representative Cole
Dawson, presenting his findings
on the possible open exam
policy, said, ‘‘I think it will be
very good and very well receiv-
ed.”’

The EC will vote Monday on
whether to recommend
Dawson’s proposal to the Facul-
ty Executive Committee.

Dawson’s proposal consists of
the following major points:

— Students must hand in ex-
am envelopes with their name,
course and professor’s name to
their professor by 4:30 p.m. on

the Wednesday preceding ex-
ams. A student who fails to
meet that deadline will not be
allowed to take a Saturday ex-
am unless he receives an ex-
emption from his professor.

— Students are not required
to specify a date and time for an
exam on their envelope; nor do
they have to notify their pro-
fessor of the date and time.

— The same exam times (9
a.m.-noon and 2 p.m.-5 p.m.)
still will apply.

— The EC must pledge the
services of four or five students
per exam time (i.e. — twice a
day, 9 a.m. and 2 p.m.) to help
the secretaries in the Com-
merce School, history depart-
ment and math department
distribute exams. Executive
Committee members, Universi-
ty Council members and class
officers will share that respon-
sibility.

The Faculty EC will make a
recommendation on the plan to

Grand jury calls Jenevein
in local drug investigation

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

Executive Committee Presi-
dent Robert C. Jenevein
testified last Thursday before
the special grand jury in-
vestigating drug use in Lex-
ington and Rockbridge County.

University President John D.
Wilson and Dean of Students
Lewis G. John have also been
subpoenaed by the panel.

Commonwealth’s Attorney
John Read told Jenevein that he
had been called in connection
with his role as president of the
Washington and Lee student
body. r

The special grand jury, which
convened on Nov. 2 and has
since had nine other sessions,
was created by Circuit Court

the faculty as a whole during its
regular meeting Feb. 6. If the
faculty approves the plan, it
would go into effect for this
term’s exams, Dawson said.

Scott Mason, a _ junior
representative to last year’s
EC, initiated the study, which
Dawson was appointed to con-
tinue this year. ‘

Also Monday night, the EC
announced that, following the
receipt of letters from the law
school administration and an
executive session last week, it
had decided not to change its
policy regarding withdrawals in
the face of an honor violation
charge. A student who with-
draws after being charged with
an honor violation is no longer
considered in good standing
with the university.

‘“‘A student would not really
consider withdrawal in the face
of an honor violation unless he
had committed an honor viola-

(continued on page 12)

Judge George E. Honts III in
response to a request from
Read.

Read’s motion had been en-
dorsed by Lexington Police

Chief L.O. Sutton and
Rockbridge Sheriff S.M.
Reynolds.

At the time, Honts said the
nine jurors’ purpose was ‘‘to in-
vestigate drug trafficking and
certain other criminal activity
in this community.”

Special grand juries in
Virginia do not indict, but in-
stead issue recommendations to
a regular grand jury. According
to the Commonwealth code, the
jurors have subpoena power
and can cite witnesses for per-
jury and for contempt.

As with all grand juries, the
testimony is secret.

Clerk of Court Bruce Patter-
son said that this is the first
special grand jury in this area
in memory. He said the best in-
dications are that the last one
was in the 1920s.

According to records made
available by Patterson, Jene-
vein is currently the only W&L
student to have received a sum-
mons from the grand jury.

Among the 80 names released
are several VMI cadets. A few
of the people called have

testified more than once. In ad-
dition, a number of juveniles,
mostly from Lexington High
School, have testified, but their
names were not made public.

Former W&L students Wil-
liam L. Dederick, Marc A. Ham
and Thomas J. Rohrig, all of
whom have been convicted of
drug possession, have appeared
before the panel. The three are
serving suspended sentences
and are on ten years’ probation.

VMI Superintendent Sam S.
Walker and Commandant of
Cadets Harold B. Snyder Jr.
have been subpeonaed.

Walker said in a statement
obtained through his office that
he was unable to testify last
Thursday as originally schedul-
ed, and that his appearance had
been postponed.

Dean John said that his ap-
pearance has been rescheduled
for Jan. 27, and Wilson was ex-
pected to testify today.

Jenevein said that prior to his
appearance he expected that
they would ask him ‘about
honor system proceedings and
who we’ve dealt with in regard
to drugs.”’

“T can’t think of any other
reason that they would have
called me,”’ he said.

ODK initiates 26 students
at annual convocation

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s Alpha Chapter of
Omicron Delta Kappa, the
honorary fraternity for campus
leaders, held its annual inita-
tion, or ‘“‘tap day,’ ceremonies
during the Founders’ Day con-
vocation today.

W&L President John D.
Wilson delivered the principal
address for the convocation pro-
gram.

During the _ initiation
ceremonies, 26 W&L law and
undergraduate students were
“tapped” into membership in

the fraternity along with
Washington and Lee Dean
William J. Watt and three pro-
minent alumni of the university
— J. Carter Fox of West Point,
Va.; W. Hayne Hipp of Green-
ville, S.C.; and William J.
Wilcox Jr. of Oak Ridge, Tenn.

ODK was founded at Wash-
ington and Lee in 1914 and
recognizes superior leadership
achievements in various areas
of campus life.

Review and Outlook

 

Honor and the Law

In calling Washington and Lee Student Body Presi-
dent Bob Jenevein before his special drug grand jury
last Thursday, Commonwealth’s Attorney Beverly C.
“John” Read came dangerously close to opening a
conflict with numerous and monumental repercus-
sions.

In an effort to crack down on the major drug
distributors in the Rockbridge area, Read has formed
a grand jury to investigate drug trafficking which in-
evitably intersects with the W&L community. But by
tapping a witness for testimony without concrete
reasoning that he has valuable knowledge about drug
trafficking, Read has seemingly taken a stray step.

In calling Jenevein for testimony merely because
he is the student body president, Read and the of-
ficials behind the grand jury have come uncomfor-
tably close to clashing Virginia State law and the
Washington and Lee Honor System. As president of
the student body and the Executive Committee, Jene-
vein is entrusted with an honor code which transcends
law and consequently he is expected to hold that code
in complete confidentiality.

Although that confidentiality was not threatened
Thursday, Jenevein could have potentially been pos-
ed with the choice of being cited and charged for con-
tempt of court for an attempt to uphold the integrity
of the Honor System or exposing to public view an
Honor Code which has been Kept in reverent secrecy
for 119 years.

“I hope they’1l understand.” Jenevein said after the
testimony.

We also hope that such a confrontation does not
arise and apparently the honor system was not
threatened last week. But the grand jury is em-
powered to operate for four more months and as the
investigation heightens such a critically dangerous
situation could take place.

While Jenevein’s attitude is noble and loyal, such
qualities do not often hold up in a courtroom. It is
necessary for the University administration to take
action to ensure against such a disastrous choice. And
it is mandatory that the commonwealth’s attorney
limit his subpoenas to those who he is positive can of-
fer concrete and crucial evidence in the grand jury’s
investigation.

EEC function explained

To the Editors:

With all due respect to Mr.
Patterson and his article con-
cerning the Common Market
which appeared in last week’s
Phi, the common agricultural
policy of the E.E.C. does not
“pay farmers not to produce
above a given quantity.” To the
contrary it guarantees farmers
minimum prices for given pro-
ducts regardless of their sup-
ply. Although the guaranteed
price is below the expected
market price, this guaranty
nevertheless leads to a
misallocation of resources, that
is, overproduction in certain
sectors. This is one of the

negative aspects of CAP as it
presently exists.

The principal complaint of
Great Britain and West Ger-
many is their feeling that they
are getting an “unjust return”’
from the E.E.C. These two
countries and France are by far
the largest contributors to the

of 24 percent from 1973 to 1981.
FEOGA (European Fund for
Agricultural Orientation and
Guaranties) is presently ac-
countable for approximately
two-thirds of the annual budget
expenditure. Due to the struc-
ture of their economics, Great

Britain and West Germany
each receive a small portion of
these funds and thus resent the
fact that they are making little
more than transfer payments to
those countries in the communi-
ty whose economies depend
more heavily on agricultural
production than do _ theirs.
However, a_ cost-benefit
analysis of the gains that in-
dividual member countries
have reaped from the communi-
ty’s agricultural policy is an in-
complete measure of the
benefits of economic integra-
tion.

IU details funding stand

To the Editors:

We would like to take this op-
portunity to expand upon Bruce
Potter’s article in last week’s
Phi, which concerned itself with
the Executive Committee’s
denial of the Independent
Union’s budget request.
However, we still feel that we
are entitled to EC funding and
would like to point out why.

First of all, the EC has an ac-
count called EC Funding, which
has a balance of $2,000. The pur-
pose of this account is two-fold,
1) to help those groups which
have a deficit, and 2) to help
new groups which missed the
first budget hearing. Since we
are a new group, we feel that we
are entitled to a portion of this
account.

Second, since every student
pays $70 a year on student tax-
es, we feel that those students
who belong to IU are entitled to

see their money used by an
organization in which they par-
ticipate.

Third, the EC claims that we
do not deserve money since
they perceive us as a fraternity
and the fraternities don’t get
any money from EC. Why then
did the EC allocate $1,500 to Stu-
dent Association for Black Uni-
ty?

» Fourth, the EC refused our
request because they feel we
cater to a narrow scope of the

EC must avoid prejudice in

dealing with independents

By SCOTT MASON
Phi Columnist

The Executive Committee
seems to have had a quiet year
so far. It hasn’t made any
heroic achievements but hasn’t
made any serious blunders
either. It appears to be doing its
job efficiently, and as long as it
continues to do so, there’s no
need for bold headlines. After
all, no news is goodnews.

But last week the EC stepped
out from under its shell and
very quickly throttled cries for
financial help uttered by the
newly-formed Independent
Union. The IU asked for more
than $600 — ‘‘hardware’”’ to get
the organization on its feet. It
didn’t get a cent.

It’s probably safe to say that
there’s a certain antagonism
that exists between fraternity
members and independents —
“goddamn independents” as
they’re commonly referred to
on the Hill. They’re seen as out-
casts in a fraternity-dominated
environment — guys who just
don’t fit in.

It’s ironic but also a little bit
disturbing that nine of the 10
undergraduate members of the
EC belong to fraternities. On
the surface, that may suggest
that the EC was biased when it
decided not to give the in-
dependents money. However,
the EC said its reason for refus-
ing the Independent Union’s re-
quest was the IU had not
previsouly informed the com-
mittee of its intentions to ask for
funds. Executive Committee
policy states that organizations

seeking funds must notify the
EC a week in advance. Further-
more, some EC members be-
lieved the IU would be better off
working strictly among
themselves.

To IU Chairmen Joe Cadle
and Jim Sarle, it must have
seemed as though their pro-
posal was doomed from the
start. It was probably like step-
ping into enemy territory; they
weren’t facing the EC, but
rather a bunch of fraternity
boys eager to gun down any
move by the ‘goddamn in-
dependents’’ to organize. Better
to keep the outcasts out than to

 

Reader’s
Advocate

give them a foot in the door of
the “elite” W&L social scene.
Whatever the independents’
feelings, EC President Bob
Jenevein assures the commit-
tee made its decision without
bias when it chose to reject the
IU’s plea for funds. “‘If there is
an antagonism between frater-
nity members and independ-
ents, I’m sure it played no role
in our decision “‘ Jenevein said.
The incident brings to light
the issue of objectivity, an issue
which not only the EC should be
aware of, but the Ring-tum Phi
as well. From the press’ point of
view, a reporter has a tough
job. He must report events ac-

 

curately without interjecting
his own personal opinions into
the news. It’s often a job easier
said than done. Time and again,
the press has been accused of
slanting the news. When that
happens, when news is slanted
the public is mislead. Further-
more, the press goes beyond its
role of informing the public and
takes on a role of telling its au-
dience what’s right and what’s
wrong.
Even a_ small-college
newspaper like the Ring-tum
Phi must realize the danger
when personal biases get in the
way of facts. But the Phi isn’t
alone in its obligation to watch

‘ out for this danger; a. small-

college student government
must recognize it too.

No one is accusing the mem-
bers of the Executive Commit-
tee of letting their personal opi-
nions interfere with their
judicial decisions, in this case,
their refusal to grant funds to
the Independent Union. But it is
something the EC should take
note of. Even subconscious
biases are apt to affect the out-
come of a decision or the repor-
ting of news, and the more an
EC member of Ring-tum Phi
reporter is aware of these
biases, the easier it will be to
take an objective point of view.

The Executive Committee
may have caused a ripple in the
calm waters of its so-far quiet
year. But whether the EC’s ac-
tions are ‘‘quiet” or capture
bold headlines doesn’t really
matter. It’s quiet consciences
that count.

Kissinger committee overlooked morality

By NELSON PATTERSON
Staff Reporter

When the Kissinger Commis-
sion on Central America releas-
ed its findings this past week,
Spanish Professors’ S.J.
Williams Jr. and Laurent
Boetsch were watching careful-
ly — watching to see whether
the report would be just another
stamp on Reagan’s policy in the
region or whether it might
signal a real change in policy.
What they saw neither surpris-
ed them nor pleased them.

Most upsetting to the two pro-
fessors was a glaring absence in
the report.

‘‘Lacking in the commission’s
report was morality. There was
a refusal to acknowledge the
morality involved. It just did
not incorporate the moral with
the political,’’ Boetsch said.

Williams concurred. “There
is no mention of morality in the
report, much less a mentioning
of humanitarianism. And
humanitarianism is just what is
in our national interests,” he

noted.

The commission report, re-
leased last Thursday in
Washington with great fanfare
proposed an increased aid
schedule to Latin American
countries. It urged that a

“In El Salvador, military aid
will kill people. Tying military
aid to human rights assumes
that some killing is okay, other
is not. Is that human rights? It
must be addressed,”’ Boetsch
pointed out. ‘The commission

 

‘We tread on thin ice when we

tell countries they must

improve their human rights.

’

 

greater emphasis be placed on
human rights when military aid
is given, and it. placed greater
emphasis on economic aid to
the region.

The whole question of aid to
the region irritated the pro-
fessors a great deal.

Boetsch was upset by the no-
tion of tying military aid to
human rights, for reasons not
commonly cited.

addressed the issue (of human
rights) but their conclusions are
really nothing new.”

On the question of economic
aid to the region, Boetsch is

equally adamant. “It’s hard to
oppose economic aid to a pover-
ty stricken region. But before
we give it, let’s find out where it
is going and what happens to it.
We may just be bolstering the
elite. We just have little idea of

where it goes,”’ he said.

The idea of sending aid to a
country in the midst of a civil
war is equally preposterous to
Boetsch.

“Send economic aid to a coun-
try in civil war? What sort of
economic infrastructure is pre-
sent?” he questioned.

Williams, while not as ada-
mant as Boetsch, agrees that
aid is a tricky question. He ap-
proaches the commission’s
recommendations on aid from a
different perspective.

“We tread on thin ice when
we tell countries they must im-
prove their human rights. What
is human rights? If the people
cannot address their grievances
to a responsible government,
then, you see, to what extent
can we tie aid to that region?”’
Williams asked.

“Aid is theoretically, I sup-
pose, humanitarian in purpose.
Don’t we act paternalistically in
giving this aid? ‘Won’t you be
good children?’ we seem to be
saying to the countries,”’
Williams said.

“Our capitalistic enterprises
have worked these countries
over,’’ he added.

While the report made no
mention of the contras receiv-
ing CIA backing in their at-
tempt to overthrow the San-
dinista government in
Nicaragua, both professors
pointed to the U.S. backing of
such subversive movements as
indicative of the short-
sightedness of U.S. policy in the
region.

“IT am absolutely opposed to
covert aid. I am opposed in the
strongest terms,’’ Boetsch
stated.

Boetsch continued to defend
his policy by noting that all the
contras seem to be doing is kill-
ing innocent civilians and
wreaking havoc on _ the
Nicaraguan economy, an
economy which until two years
ago the U.S. subsidized.
Boetsch is no strong supporter
of Nicaragua, either.

“The original intent of the
revolution was good,’’ Boetsch

IU seeks to ‘clear
the air’ with SAB

By PETER WRIGHT
Staff Reporter

Communication between the
Independent Union and the Stu-
dent Activities Board (SAB)
has begun as a result of a
meeting among Independent
Union Chairman Jim Sarle,
SAB Chairman Andy Cooney
and Assistant Dean of Students
Mike Cappeto.

The two chairmen said they
want to ‘‘clear the air’ between
the two organizations.

After being denied $623.40 in
funds by the Executive Com-
mittee last week, the Indepen-
dent Union is now seeking help
from the SAB in hope of expand-
ing on the number of social ac-
tivities offered to students.

Requests made by the In-
dependent Union include offer-
ing more social activities and
that these social activities not
always be “‘band parties.”’

SAB chairman Andy Cooney
said he is open for suggestions

- and added that he anticipated
no major problems in working
with the Independent Union.
“It’s no real problem unless
there is a conflict with bands at
the same time,”’ Cooney said.

Last weekend, the two
organizations had scheduled
bands in the Cockpit for both
Friday and Saturday night.

Sarle said that he did not wish
“to step on the toes’’ of the SAB
but wanted to enhance the
social life for the independents
at W&L.

As it stands, Cooney said
there is one problem, however,
in regard to competition be-
tween the SAB and the frater-
nities at W&L. Cooney said the
majority of the students in
fraternities, which compose ap-
proximately 60 percent of the
student body, would rather at-
tend their respective house par-
ties than an SAB party. Conse-

“THE

quently, Cooney said he
recognized that there is not an
adequate amount of social ac-
tivities for the independents. He
added, though, that it was not
financially feasible for the SAB
to have parties at the same
times fraternities did.

Dean Cappeto said he too
realizes the problem the in-
dependents face. “Weekends
can be pretty dull for in-
dependents,,’ he said.

Suggestions have been pro-
posed to force fraternities to
leave one weekend open for an
SAB party, yet both Sarle and
Cooney said they felt the idea
would not work.

SAB Treasurer John Hay-
wood said he thinks the building
of a new University pavilion
would help matters. He added
that the SAB is limited by its
current facilities and pointed
out that a new pavilion could
prompt a possible reorganiza-
tion of the SAB. With this possi-
ble reorganization, the desire
among the students for more
weekend parties would be
seriously taken into considera-
tion, Haywood said.

According to EC President
Bob Jenevein, the answer to the
independent students’ problems
is not the Independent Union.
Jenevein said that the feeling
among EC members is that the
Independent Union is like a
fraternity and should not be
eligible for money from the stu-
dent tax fund.

Jenevein said that although
he “perceived social problems
for the independent students, he
is far from convinced that the
Independent Union is capable of
solving these problems.

‘Maybe the SAB needs to do
more,” Jenevein said.

appropriating more money to

the SAB to help meet the needs
of the Independent Union, Jene-

vein said the EC will wait and

see how the Independent Union
develops.

Sarle said he wanted the In-
dependent Union to help unify
the independents, promote in-
tramural participation, and act
as a meeting place for in-
dependents.

Sarle added that he also saw a
need for the Independent Union
to act as a lobbying group,
because, he said, ‘‘Decisions on
campus...overlook the in-
dependents.”’

Although the Independent
Union, which is financed from
Dean Cappeto’s and Dean
Lewis John’s budgets, con-
tinues to face financial pro-
blems, Sarle is still optimistic.
“T think it can work...if the sup-
port keeps up,” he said.

bring probation

By STEVEN POCKRASS

An increased number of
freshmen and sophomores on
academic probation at Wash-
ington and Lee has led to a
higher-than-average _ total

ates on probation this term.

is below 1.50 as freshmen, 1.6 as
sophomores, 1.8 as juniors or 1.9
as seniors. )

According to statistics releas-
ed by Dean of Students Lewis G.
John, a total of 77 students were
placed on academic probation
after Fall term.

That figure was coraposed of
48 freshmen (13 percent of the
class), 12 sophomores (3.6 per-
cent), seven juniors (2.3 per-
cent) and 10 seniors (3 percent).

The total number of students
on probation is up slightly from
the fall term total last year, 70,
and the fall term total of 1981,
72.

The number of freshmen on
academic probation rose sharp-
ly from last year’s 33, but Dean
John feels that last year may
have seen ‘“‘an unusually low
number.’’

This is supported by the fact
that there were 48 freshmen on
probation two years ago, and 47
in 1977, 1978, and 1979. The
freshman average for the past
seven years is 42.

Students on probation may
not participate in more than one
extra-curricular activity during
the tenure of their probation,
while students whose G.P.A.’s
are below the minimum at the
end of the shool year will fall
unter the Automatic Rule and
will not be asked back, unless
reinstated by the Automatic
Rule Committee.
SAC extends Pika penalty

by JOHN CLEGHORN
Chief Editor

A recommendation from the
Interfraternity Council Judicial
Board to extend a social proba-
tion penalty for Pi Kappa Alpha
from two weeks to three weeks
was accepted Wednesday by the

Student Affairs Committee,

The original IFC ruling,
which was a penalty for a
pledge-fraternity activity which
resulted in medical attention
for two Pika pledges, was ex-
tended after new evidence was
discovered, according to Dean
of Students Lewis G. John.

In addition to the social pro-
bation period, Pika was penaliz-
ed $150 and was required to
begin an alcohol awareness pro-

gram, Dean John said,

The probation period began
after the first IFC ruling Jan. 5
and will end Jan. 26.

The pledge activity which
drew the penalty occured in
early December. One freshman
suffered a broken leg attemp-
ting to dodge a falling tree to be
used for a house Christmas
tree. A second freshman was
treated the same day by an
Emergency Medical Service
team for severe intoxication.

In addition, the IFC Judicial
Board placed Phi Kappa Sigma
on social probation following a
noise violation conviction in
Lexington District Court. The
noise violation is the first of the

1983-84 year.
The conditions of social pro-
bation are:

— No fraternity-sponsored
social functions are allowed by
a fraterntiy on social probation.

— No females are allowed in
the fraternity house of a frater-
nity on social probation.

— No more than five mem-
bers of a fraternity on social
probation can congregate at
any fraternity- or IFC-
sponsored social functions.

— A statement pledging that
all regulations have been
adhered to must be signed by
the house president.

14% of DUIs g0 to W&L

By BILL WOOLFOLK
Special to the Phi

Who remembers the party

Saturday, Feb. 20, 1982? Or the ©

one on Sunday, July 11, 1982?
How about the dance on Satur-
day, April 23, 1983?

There are three Washington &
Lee students who probably wish
they hadn’t been on the streets
of Lexington those days. Those
three dates were randomly
chosen from a two-year list of
arrests for driving under the in-
fluence of alcohol in the city of
Lexington, and one each of
those dates a W&L student was
charged with driving under the
influence.

Judicial records for the city
show that 121 persons were ar-
rested and charged with driving
under the influence of alcohol
(DUI) during 1982. That figure
for 1983 is 124.

Seventeen W&L students
were charged with DUI during
1982, 14 percent of the total DUI
arrests. In 1983 20 students were
arrested, 17.7 percent of the
total.

Can you recognize any of the
dates mentioned before? The
calendar shows no major

holidays, social functions or
university ceremonies on those
dates. However, in 1982, 29 (35)
of the DUI’s occurred the day of
a major holiday, social function
such as Fancy Dress and
Homecoming, or major univer-
sity function such as com-
mencement. Of those 35, seven
were W&L students. In 1983
those figures shifted upward,
with 45 DUI’s, nine of which
were W&L students.

You might expect more
students would be stopped for
DUI during major social func-
tions. Indeed, the records show
there were more DUI arrests at
those times in 1982 and 1983.
Take Fancy Dress weekend, for
example. In 1982 there were
eight DUI arrests, including
three W&L students, Fancy
Dress weekend. Four people
were arrested for DUI during
Fancy Dress 1983; none were
students. Someone could
possibly make a big deal out of
Friday March 5, 1982, the night
of the Fancy Dress Ball. The
greatest number of students ar-
rested on a single date occurred
that day: two.

What about fraternity rush?
September 1982 ranks tenth out

of the 24 months studied with
eight DUI’s, two of them
students. But September 1983
ranked first in the two years
with 29 DUI’s, seven of those 29
being students.

The percentage of W&L
students arrested during the
two rush periods actually drop-
ped between 1982 and 1983, fall-
ing almost nine-tenths of one
percent. :

charging Carletto with assault
and battery and Keeting with
assault and battery and
destruction of property.

The two were in town because
W&L, in its final football game
of the year, was playing
Lebanon Valley that afternoon.

According to Lexington
Police Chief Lawrence 0. Sut-
ton, the Parents’ Weekend inci-
dent began at about 1:30 a.m. as
Valder was leaving the Cockpit.

Carletto told officers he was
in the road when Valder began
to back up his car which almost
struck Carletto. A confrontation

resulted, according to the
report, and Carletto jumped up
on the hood of Valder’s car.

Valder then drove away,
throwing Carletto into the
street, the report says. Keeting,
a friend of Carletto’s, is said to
have pursued the vehicle, and

ty
a el a il i ee a el,

when it stopped at the stoplight
at Main and Nelson streets,
Keeting is said to have knocked
out Valder’s driver’s window
with his fists.

Keeting then held Valder, Sut-
ton said, until Carletto arrived.
A fight apparently ensued
among the three of them. Police
arrived shortly thereafter.

Carletto and Valder were
taken to the Stonewall Jackson
emergency room, where they
were both treated for facial
cuts, bruises and swelling.

Valder was released, and
Carletto was held for observa-
tion because of stitches he had
received.

Sutton said that Valder
originally requested charges of

serious offense, but the

Nobel Laureate to read ® |

English, Polish works

Nobel Laureate Cheslaw

Milosz will present a reading
from his works at Washington
and Lee University on Wednes-
day, Jan. 25.

Sponsored by the Glasgow
Endowment

Committee at

  
   

~ CHESLAW MILOSZ

W&L, the program will be at 8
p.m. in Lee Chapel. It is open to
the public at no charge.

The winner of the 1980 Nobel
Prize for Literature, Milosz is
an internationally honored poet,
essayist and novelist who has
been hailed as ‘‘one of the
greatest poets of our time,
possibly the greatest’ by
critics.

He is the author of two.

volumes of poetry, ‘‘Selected
Poems” and “Bells in Winter”’
and two novels, ‘‘The Issa
Valley” and “The Seizure of
Power’ as well as_ several
essays.

Since coming to the United

States in 1961, Milosz has
translated his early works from
Polish into English. His reading
will be given in English though
he will include some poems in
Polish.

Milosz was born in Lithuania
in 1911. A few years later his
engineer father moved the
family to Russia. But after
World War I, they returned to
his hometown, which had be-
come Polish territory known as
Wilno.

During World War II he work-
ed in Warsaw as a writer and
editor of Resistance publica-
tions. When the war ended, he
joined the Polish Diplomatic
Service, but broke with the
Regime in 1951, settling in Paris
to devote himself to writing and
translating.

He came to the United States
from France in 1961 at the in-
vitation of the University of
California, Berkeley, to teach
Slavic languages and literature.
Now an American citizen, he re-
mains at Berkeley as a tenured
professor on leave. He has also
served recently as a Dis-
tinguished Visiting Professor at
Harvard and at the University
of Michigan.

In 1981, after 30 years of en-
forced absence from Poland,
Milosz was invited to revisit his
homeland and was presented
with an honorary doctorate
from the Catholic Univesity in
Lublin. During his visit, he met
and talked with Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa.

Jenevein clarifies EC
view of drugs, honor

Executive Committee Presi-
dent Robert C. Jenevein
reacted this week to confusion
and controversy over whether
the EC has stated its view of
drugs in light of the Honor Code.

“There is a gross misunder-
standing among the student
body,”’ he said. “We are not
about to codify the system.

“Everything is treated case
by case. That is not to say that
any particular case of drug-
dealing will result in an honor
violation. Many cases may still
end up in Student Control.”

Last year’s EC had stated
that drugs would be the ex-
clusive province of the Student

Control Committee.

“Our statement was an effort
to free the system of codifica-
tion,’ Jenevein said. ‘‘We felt
we had to clarify our return to
policy.”

Jenevein expressed some
uncertainty as to how students
were reacting to knowledge
they might have of other
students’ activities involving
controlled substances.

“It’s a culture barrier with
this generation,” he said.
“Modern students are not likely
to turn in fellow students either
to the law or to the EC for use or
distribution of drugs. We can
only encourage them to do
that.’’

‘It’s a chance to do well while doing good. ’

Superdance provides WGL with a party and MDA funds for the handicapped

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee’s 1984
Muscular Dystrophy Super-
dance will give students a
chance to do something good
while having fun, Superdance
co-chairman Rick DeAlessan-
drini said.

Scheduled for Jan. 27-29 in
Evans Dining Hall, the Super-
dance will include four bands,
pie throws and a radiothon on
WLUR. The four bands will be
Brice Street, The Sparkplugs,
Caspar and Steps.

“It’s a chance to do well while
doing good. It’s a lot of fun,”’
said senior Mark Mitschow,
who will be dancing in the
Superdance for the second time.

The reason for the Super-
dance cannot be overshadowed
by the fun, however. Super-
dance co-chairman Markham
Pyle notes that many of the
poster children who attend the
dance cannot make it back the
next year because their condi-
tion has gotten worse.

‘That is not good. We have to
raise money to help solve the
problem. This is one of the
places where capitalism anc
charity intersect,”’ Pyle said.

DeAlessandrini also recalled
some of his experiences with
victims of muscular dystrophy.

“Some of the children who
are afflicted with MD come in
wheelchairs. They lose their
muscle control, but their minds
still work. They’re really not
handicapped when it comes to
the mind.” Dealessandrini said.

“They’re having to deal with
problems that are bigger than
life,’’ DeAlessandrini said.

DeAlessandrini said that
remembering what you’re dan-
cing for gives you the adrenalin
to keep going during the 30-hour
dance.

“Even though you're tired,
you realize what it’s for,’’ he
said.

DeAlessandrini has been

Back to the old grindstone, eh? Well,
it's good to see you again.

working on the Superdance for
three years. He previously had
served as entertainment chair-
man.

“At first, I just got into it
because it’s such a big
weekend. It’s a lot of fun. It’s
not anything that I consider a
burden,” DeAlessandrini said.

‘“‘Now, I sense that the at-
titude is that we can do
something good by having fun
ourselves. It’s probably the
most rewarding thing that I’ve
been involved with at W&L,”’
observed DeAlessandrini.

Mitschow said that he had
some reservations about the
Superdance at first because of
the 30-hour duration of the
dance.

“I didn’t think I could do it.
But I really enjoyed it,”
Mitschow said.

Mitschow said he was tired
after the two-hour break at 6
a.m. Saturday and near the end
of the dance.

“It’s not as bad as 30 hours
sounds. They keep you oc-
cupied. Anything to keep your
mind off the time,’’ Mitschow
explained.

However, Mitschow advises
anyone who is planning to dance
not to go to sleep during the two-
hour break because it is dif-
ficult to wake up after the short
nap.

DeAlessandrini said the pie

idea of W&L journalism pro-
fessor Robert de Maria.
DeMaria will again be one of

Although the dancing natural-

become popular in the last few
years.

DeAlessandrini said the
Superdance committee tries to
get professors who will attract
different groups of students who
are eager to toss a pie at a pro-
fessor in exchange for a con-
tribution to MDA. The commit-
tee usually tries to get someone
from the commerce school, the
military science department
and the physical education
department.

But the target who brought in
the most money last year was

tor, Pyle, said DeAlessandrini.
Several of the staffers who
worked for Pyle on the Super-
dance raised over $200 in order
to earn the right to smash a pie
into Pyle’s face.

“He was a pretty good sport
about it. He knows how he can
get people going,’’ DeAlessan-
drini said regarding Pyle’s
sacrifice. :

“He saw it as a chance to
benefit a good cause, or, as
Markham would say, a chance
to be cost effective,’ DeAles-
sandrini joked.

“The pie was a surprise. Ap-
parently, I’d been working my
staffers a little too hard,” Pyle
remarked.

“‘T was glad to do it, of course.

_ Anything for the kids,” he said.

DeAlessandrini said _ that
W&L President John D. Wilson
had said that he would be will-
ing to become a target of a pie,
but his schedule forced him to
be out of town this weekend.

‘‘President Wilson, as an out-
sider, came in and observed the
Superdance last year, and he
picked up the sense of it im-
mediately. If we can come off
that way, then I think we’re
headed in the right direction,”
DeAlessandrini said.

Superdance committee hopes to
raise $28,000 this year for the
Muscular Dystrophy Associa-
tion.

W&L’s 1983 Superdance rais-
ed more money per capita for
the Muscular Dystrophy
Association than any other col-
lege fundraiser. W&L was 12th
in total funds raised.

DeAlessandrini said that the
steering committee began work
on the Superdance almost im-
medrately after classes began
in September. The committee
started having meetings twice a
week in December.

In addition to the steering
committee, the dancers, spec-
tators and athletes who serve as
security guards all are vital to
the event’s success, DeAlessan-
drini said.

Jerry Darrell, who provided
Evans Dining hall for the Super-
dance, and the W&L frater-
nities, which contributed money
to pay for one of the bands, also
deserve credit, noted DeAles-
sandrini.

One addition to the Super-
dance this year will be the
WLUR radiothon. WLUR will
broadcast segments of the con-
certs, and disc jockeys Bob
Halloran and Taylor Hathaway
will broadcast live from Evans
Dining Hall form 2 p.m. to 5
p.m. Saturday. Halloran and
Hathaway will play three dance
sets Saturday afternoon.

“If you’re not dancing, come
out and have a beer and enjoy
the concert. Pledge money to
somebody to dance,’’ DeAles-
sandrini said.
 

Impressed

Lee Chapel curator returned to W&L
on basis of his first visit

By B. SCOTT TILLEY
Staff Reporter

Robert C. Peniston — known
as Capt. Peniston to those
around the university — seems
to epitomize the essence of the
mythic Washington and Lee
gentleman.

His blue blazer, gray vest and
tartan wool pants effervesce the
spirit of traditional Washington
and Lee dress.

But even more so, the spirit of
Peniston, who directs Lee
Chapel and the museum, seems
to come to life when the Captain
' speaks.

“The first time I stepped foot
on campus was in the summer
of 1971, when we brought our
son’s gear up from Florida. My
wife and I remarked then that
there was something different
about W&L,”’ said Peniston, sit-
ting in his “home” in Lee
Chapel.

“As I reflect back over the
years, the spirit of Robert E.

Tee is the only way I can ex- .

plain it. Somehow General
Lee’s spirit endures here. I’ve
always been impressed with
_
- Captain Peniston even com-
pares that feeling to the
historical atmosphere that
abounds at his alma mater, the
U.S. Naval Academy.

“The historical aura is strong
there, but I feel it just as strong-

 

ly here. The two institutions go
about it differently, but there is
not two cents worth of dif-
ference bewteen their objec-
tives — turning out men of
Honor.”’

Capt. Peniston arrived at the
Naval Academy by way of
Wichita, Kan., where he grew
up. He graduated in the Class of
’46 in an accelerated three-year
curriculum designed to turn out
officers for the war effort. His
first ship assignment was the
U.S.S. New Jersey.

After 23 years of various
assignments, Peniston ex-
perienced ‘‘the biggest thrill of
my life, really,’ when he was
assigned to return to that first
ship, the New Jersey, as com-
manding officer.

That assignment also proved
to be ‘‘one of his greatest heart-
aches’’ as the New Jersey was
inactivated during his com-
mand. Just last year, though,
Capt. Peniston took part in the
fanfare accompanying the
recommission of the ship.

After leaving the New Jersey,
he commanded one of the
“Goldplated cruisers,’ the
U.S.S. Albany. “I take great
pride,’’ he said, ‘‘in the fact that
I am one of the few officers of
the navy to command both a
battlehsip and a cruiser.”’

Peniston said his hardest job

was as assistant chief of staff —

to possible Russian entry into
the Arab-Israeli War.”’

Peniston’s association with
Washington and Lee first began
in 1971 when he was command-
ing the Albany. His son, Robert,
wanted to go to the University.
As Peniston remembers, being
Florida residents and with 1971
being the first year Virginia ac-
cepted women, Robert didn’t
stand a “snowball in Hell’s
chance of getting in.” Peniston
then recommended to his son a
school in the Shenandoah Valley
that he had never visited, but
that was named after General
Robert E. Lee.

“If it has anything to do with
Robert E. Lee, you can’t go
wrong,”’ he said.

The family was ‘‘enamored”
with the place, but the son, who
was a Phi Kappa Sigma, died in
1975, just short of graduation.

“The four years he spent here
were the four happiest years of
his life,’’ reflected Capt.
Peniston, ‘‘and if he was so
pleased with it, the best thing
we could do was to become a
part of it, and be of assistance.”’

Peniston is now in charge of
all aspects of Lee Chapel, a job
he accepts with reverent
seriousness.

insurance coordinator, and in
1981 he coordinated the first
successful movable equipment
inventory ever taken at W&L.

“Anything I can do to
enhance the image or stature of
Washington and Lee, I’m glad
to do it. I’m willing to do
anything willing to be done.”’

Mrs. Peniston has also
become active in the W&L com-
munity, according to her hus-
band.

“She has taken many history
courses, and she loves them.

Peniston, paraphrasing Will
Rogers. ‘‘I find that they are a
pretty darn good cut of
America.”’

Because of the love he has
developed for the university,
Peniston opposes the lingering
question of coeducation, though
he admits he has ‘‘..no basis
other than a visceral feeling
that it is not necessary. It just
seems to me that W&L is unique
now, and if it changes I don’t
know if it would continue along
that line or not. I would hope
that Washington and Lee could
find a way to remain all-male
and still be the outstanding in-
stitution that it is.”

But, Capt. Peniston em-
phasized in conclusion, the
coeducation factor has not been
the significant tradition that
has set this school apart.

“The punchline with me is
that Washington and Lee has
endured over the years because
of the principle General Lee
laid down...that every man has
to be a gentleman.

“That is the most difficult
rule you can put down. Most

And she hasn’t met a troop up

Capt. Peniston even ‘‘saw to

Lexington Police Chief L.O.
Sutton is urging Washington
and Lee students to report
break-ins and other crimes im-
mediately after they occur.

“They don’t report things
promptly,”” he said Monday.
‘They’ ll have to if they expect
any help from the police.

“We usually get the reports
second- or third-hand. We'd
prefer to get them from the in-
dividual.”

This includes matters which
involve W&L proctor Charles
Murray. ‘Instead of calling
Murph, call us,”’ Sutton said.

“If it is an offense and if it oc-
curs within the city limits of
Lexington, we’re responsible
for it we’ll come out,” he said.

“We'll assist even in very
minor instances. We need a
report, though, because what
we don’t know about, we can’t

do anything about.”

Sutton said that often
students wait for periods rang-
ing from hours to days after a
crime has occurred before
reporting it.

“Sometimes they wait until
they find out that they need a
report for insurance purposes,”’
he said.

“The result is that frequently
the crime scene has _ been
destroyed or altered by the time
an investigating officer ar-
rives.”’

The police chief said that no
separate crime statistics are
available for Washington and
Lee or its students.

“They’re all citizens,” he
said. ‘I don’t see the University
as being separate or apart from
the community. They're all part
of the citizenry and that’s the
way the records are kept.

German professor to
lecture on Soviet law

Dietrich Andre Loeber, pro-
fessor of law at the University
of Kiel in West Germany, will
present a lecture entitled ‘‘On
the Importance of Understand-
ing Soviet Law’’ at the Washing-
ton and Lee University School
of Law on Monday, Jan. 23.

Sponsored by the Tucker Law
Forum and the International
Law Society at W&L, the lec-
ture will begin at 8 p.m. in
Classroom D of Lewis Hall. It is
open to the public at no charge.

Loeber is a visiting professor

at the Columbia University law
school.

A native of Riga, Latvia, he is
the author of four books and
about 70 articles and studies
written in English, German,
French, Italian, Spanish and
Latvian.

He has previously been a
visiting professor at the law
schools of UCLA and Stanford
University and was a research
associate in law at Harvard. He

spent a year of research at the »

Institute of International
Economic Relations in Moscow.

Grand jury ——

(continued from page 1)

Jenevein said that in order to
preserve the integrity of the
honor system’s principle of con-
fidentiality, he would refuse to
answer any such questions.

“If they were to ask me about
any personal information I have
gained outside my post as EC
President, I am bound by law
not to commit perjury but to
answer those questions.”’

He said questions regarding
the honor system were a dif-
ferent matter, however, “I was
prepared, if pressed, to tell
them that if they couldn’t
respect the confidentiality of
the honor system, they couldn’t
expect me to maintain the con-
fidentiality of the grand jury
proceeding,” he added.

“They have to do their job,
though,”’ he continued. ‘I can’t
blame them for that — I’d pro-
bably do the same thing.”

Before Jenevein testified, he
expressed concern that the
special grand jury might sub-
poena the Executive Commit-
tee’s honor records.

He indicated that his Thurs-
day appearance did not allay
those fears.

“I’m concerned that in the
desire to purge W&L of drug
users, they might subpoena
these files, and that would be a
monumental mistake,” he said.

“Those files are crucial to the
strength of the honor system.
Confidentiality is one of the ma-
jor tenets that’s allowed it to
survive all these years.

“Everybody’s good is at
stake. If they ask that the files
be opened, it will have long-
term ill effects on the honor
system as a whole.”

Jenevein said that ‘‘there are
several legally recognized
reasons for -maintaining con-
fidentiality, none of which cover
our honor system.”

On Friday he sent a letter to
Read which said in_ part:
‘While there is perhaps no legal
ground for the Honor System
secrets to be kept that way,
morality and the law do not
always go hand-in-hand.

“And we all know that the
school’s Honor System and the
law are on the same side of
right and wrong.”

When asked about Jenevein’s
concern, Read said, ‘I don’t
have any comment to make
about him or the records or
anything else.

“I’m not talking to anybody
about the special grand jury.
Now is not an appropriate time
to make any comment.”

Read would say only that the
jury is “going to be a while
longer.” By law, the panel can
function in its present form for
a maximum of six months.

Before Jenevein testified, one
of the grand jurors told him that

they expected to be in business
for about two more months.

President Wilson said that he
expects that the jurors ‘‘want
my sense of the overall problem
in Lexington and the University
and they want to become more
acquainted with University
policy for student drug of-
fenses.”’

The W&L policy statement on
drugs says that the University
“shall act as neither a sword
nor a shield’? when the state
acts on an individual’s use of
controlled substances.

Wilson said that ‘‘after the
shock of last spring’ and “the
major arrests,”’ people became
“aware of the grievous conse-
quences to the career and well-
being that occur with this sort of

 

To the Editors:

The subject of my argument
is Mr. Stachura’s section in the
‘“‘Phi’’ where he shows his bias-
ed views and his stupidity. Per-
sonally, I can’t believe the Phi
promoted Mr. Stachura to
Sports Editor this year. All of
last year we heard his verbal
assaults on last year’s Heisman
Trophy winner, Hershel

Walker. Tell me something Mr.
Stachura, if someone offered
you a multi-million dollar con-
tract to be an editor for a well-
circulated paper, now, wouldn’t
you take it? I thought so.

I thought to myself, if I don’t
read his column, maybe others
are thinking on the same lines
and he won’t get to waste the
page of the ‘‘Phi’’ on his idiotic

their own union. While we are
not against charging each
member $4 or $5, this alone will
not cover our costs. As to the
contention that the _ in-
dependents don’t support their
own cause, we point to the
Automatix, the band in the
Cockpit last Saturday. The in-
dependents came out in
numbers and even enabled the
IU to net a marginal profit.

Contrary to the EC belief, we
are trying to become neither a
second SAB nor an 18th frater-
nity, claims the EC made.

Rather our purpose is to get the

W&L community to recognize
and deal with the problems we
as independents face here at
fraternity-oriented W&L. In-
dependents are an integral part
of W&L and we deserve to be
treated as such. If Deans Cap-
peto and John, as well as Presi-
dent Wilson, are able to

recognize the importance of and
need for the Independent Union,
why then cannot the EC
recognize the need for funding

the IU?

reflections. Then, maybe the
editors will use the space to
report more of the less popular
sports that many of our fellow
students participate or perhaps
something on the IM sports. It
hasn’t happened at least not
yet. I broke down and read Mr.
Stachura’s column this week
only to see he was still writing
his absurd column. (See Out,
Time) In this (Jan. 12) issue of
the “Phi” he refers to the swim
team as “The boys over at
Twombly Pool.”” How gay can
you sound? This is sports, there
is no need to exercise poetic
license.

The paragraph that disturbed
me enough to write this letter
was his “putting things into
perspective” about Georgia’s
upset victory over Texas in the
Cotton Bowl. I think it is impor-
tant to point out that both UGA
and UT have very similar game
plans — a strong defensive that
causes their opponents to make
mistakes and an offensive to
capitalize on these mistakes. In
his article Mr. Stachura says
that game films show a Georgia
lineman guilty of “flagrant”
holding penalty on the play that

Reader attacks Sports Editor’s Time Out

the winning touchdown was
scored. It’s ironic that the
referees did not make the call,
considering the Univ. of Texas
is so close to where the game
was played.

Second Mr. Stachura says
that the UGA player who re-
covered the fumbled punt that
set up the final score has failed
out of school. What does that
have to do with the price of tea

in China? Are you saying that

Gary Moss, who has now failed
out, was destined to recover the
fumble and if he wasn’t playing
that Texas would have gotten
it? Mr. Stachura fails to men-
tion anything about the Texas
player who fumbled the ball in
the first place. As I mentioned
earlier, Georgia and Texas both
prey on their opponent’s
mistakes. It was the Texas
player that made the mistake
and that’s the reason Texas lost
the game.

In closing, there are more in-
triguing sports stories that I’m
sure the students would be more
interested in reading than Mr.
Stachura’s respections.

experimentation.

“I would think that use had
fallen off after that. I get the im-
pression from conversations
with students I trust that the use
is lower. I’m leaving alcohol out
of that.”

“These felony convictions
will reverberate through the
lives of our former students in
debilitating ways,’’ Wilson con-
tinued. ‘‘I hope that some good
can come of that — that others
will realize that this is a very
serious business.”’

‘“‘We have a responsibility,”’
he said, ‘‘for creating an en-
vironment where people have
the opportunity to learn and
grow into responsible social be-
ings.

“If a student finds himself in
trouble, he should be able to ap-
proach a University official
without the fear that if he did he
would necessarily face discipli-
nary action.

“‘We would fail in our role as
mentors and ‘counselors if
Students . hesitated to seek
help.”’

“I have one further concern,”
Wilson said. ‘‘That is that our
disciplinary system is student
run and depends to a high
degree on confidentiality. I
hope that confidentiality can be
maintained.”

Lexington Police Chief Sutton
said that ‘even though the
grand jury is_ investigating,
we're still doing investigations
and making arrests.

‘“‘We’re not concentrating on
the users: we’re concentrating
on the dealers.”

Two people were recently ar-
rested in Lexington and charg-
ed with possession of narcotics
with intent to distribute.

Clinton O’Neill Turner was
located while in town with his
car with Washington, D.C.,
tags.

His preliminary hearing in
General District Court was
scheduled for Tuesday, but
Judge Joseph E. Hess granted a
continuance to Feb. 21 because
the tests on the substances con-
fiscated from his car had not
come back from the laboratory.

David Jeffrey Latrud was ar-
rested in conjunction with coun-
ty law enforcement officials.
They were able to establish
enough probable cause to
secure search warrants, raid
the house where he was staying,
and make the arrest.

Latrud’s preliminary hearing
is scheduled for Jan. 25. Both
men are free on bond.

Judge Honts, who signed the
order setting up the special
grand jury, said that the report
will come to him sealed, and
that it will be his decision
whether or not to make the
panel’s findings public.

“T haven’t made up my mind
on that, and I won’t until the
report comes in,’’ he said.

Factors he said he might take
into account include: ‘‘public
interest,” ‘‘the protection of in-
nocent people’ and ‘‘the sancti-
ty of the procedure itself.”

“The report will remain seal-
ed unless someone requests that
it be opened, and then J’ll rule
on it,” he said. “I fully expect
someone to make that request.”

because the moderate left
organizations have _ been
eliminated from the political
process by physical measures.
If we want pluralism, we need
to encourage and permit
them.”’

Boetsch noted that in Spain,
Italy and France, once the Com-
munist Party was allowed to
participate in elections and
field their own candidates, the
popularity of the party decreas-
ed. He sees the same carry-over
occurring in Latin America

noted, referring to the revolt
against the Somoza regime,
‘“‘but it has strayed from its
original intent.”

By continually attacking
Nicaragua in the press and on
land through the contras, a
polarization of political thought
and philosophy is occurring in
the region.

“The situation in Latin
America is not an East-West
conflict,” he said. “The situa-

tion results from hunger —
physical hunger and poverty.
The region has more than its
share of military rulers who
disregard human rights.”’

“The tragedy of our policy
has been that every time an op-
portunity for reform and in-
digenous revolution has raised
its head, we have been there
stomping it in the bud. We need
to back pluralism in the region.
All we now see is a radical left

were the left allowed to partake
fully in national elections. As
long as such groups do not ad-
vocate the overthrow of the
democratic process, Boetsch
believes they should be allowed
to participate.

While both professors have
problems with parts of the
report, both find hope in it also.

“The findings are positive,
though the recommendations
are not,” Boetsch said. “It is a

positive move. We now realize
that we cannot consider the
region in one-dimensional
terms. It is complex, and the
problems are different for each
of the nations.”’

Williams agrees. “If the
report shows anything, it points
to the fact that we need to
reconsider establishing rela-
tions with Cuba.”’

One glaring absence from
both the report and the recom-
mendations is the mention of
the church in Central America.

“It’s remarkable! Not one
mention of the church. It would
behoove us to listen to what the
church has to say, especially of
social injustice, of reform, and
all from a non-Marxist, non-
Leninist point of view,’’ Boetsch
said.

Both professors noted the role
of the church in Latin America
has figured prominently in the
past. Military leaders once

sought the consent of the church
in establishing any new govern-
ment. Recently, especially
after Vatican II, the church has
taken a more independent role.
Liberation theology and calls
for the righting of social in-
justices have been the new
gospels of the church, gospels
many military leaders do not
want to hear.

Criticism and praise aside, by
what authority can a professor
of modern languages comment
on a political statement?

‘*My approach does not come
from political science or
economics. My knowledge
comes from literature and
culture, and they are no less
valid. There is a great deal to be
learned in how these people ex-
press themselves. After all,
isn’t literature just another
form of revolution?’ Boetsch
asked.

tion,’’ EC President Bob Jene-
vein said.

Jenevein added that the
authority to determine whether
a student is in good standing has
been granted the EC by the
Board of Trustees.

The EC also castigated two
committees for their lack of a
proper budget report.

David Thompson of the
Frisbee Club had not prepared
a printed, duplicated budget
report for the EC. He said he
had not been informed that he
was to present a report until
Monday afternoon. Jenevein,
though, mentioned that the
schedule for budget hearings
had been in the EC minutes in
November and December.

Three members of the
Frisbee Club have paid dues for
both the fall and spring seasons
and three more paid for the fall
season, Thompson said. Dues
are $10 per season. Thompson
added that the club might have

 

Sunfire

a budget surplus at the end of
the year.

The Student Association for
Black Unity, meanwhile, had a
written budget report but no one
present to answer questions.
And there were questions.

SABU’s initial budget request
in September had been $5,100;
$3,000 for two speakers and
$2,100 for the SABU ball. The
EC cut that to $1,500, all intend-
ed for the ball.

The budget report Monday
night showed projected expen-
ditures of $750 for the ball,
which touched off debate
among the EC members as to
whether SABU was spending its
funds correctly.

“I’m not too concerned that
they’ve deviated from their
original plans.” vice president
Dave Judge said.

Dawson said, ‘‘If they’re go-
ing to substantially change
(their projected expenditures),
they should come back to us.”’

cluding law representative Jim

Green, agreed.

“If it had gone the other way
around (used speaker money to
pay for the ball), perhaps we
wouldn’t agree,’’ Green said.

Senior representative George
Youmans and freshman
representative Andrew
Caruthers said it was SABU’s
prerogative to do whatever it
liked with its money.

Action Monday night, the EC
heard an initial report from a
subcommittee, chaired by
secretary Len Howard, _in-
vestigating the possibility of
hiring a secretary for the stu-
dent organizations. Howard
said a 10-month contract for an
$8,500 salary was being con-
sidered. The secretary’s salary
would be paid from university
funds.

The EC decided also to limit
voting in tomorrow’s coeduca-
tion poll to undergraduates and
to allow the Student Bar
Association to conduct a similar
poll among law students.

Injury-ridden

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

Second-leading scorer Lex
Fitzenhagen is out of the W&L
basketball lineup for at least
two weeks with a hyperextend-
ed knee joint.

Second-leading rebounder
Scott Shannon is taking anti-
inflammatory pills to combat a
nagging knee injury.

Freshmen forwards Rob
Spencer and Jeff Harralson are
recovering from a broken bone
in the ankle and a broken
finger, respectively.

And head coach Verne Can-
field has a very big headache,
as his 8-5, injury-plagued
Generals host fourth-ranked,
undefeated Roanoke College
tonight at 7:30 in Warner
Center.

With a three-game winning
streak and a 3-0 ODAC record
after a Thursday night

thrashing of Emory & Henry,
91-49, the Generals traveled on
Saturday night to Bridgewater

College, where a_ promising
season suffered a setback.

Two minutes into the game
Fitzenhagen, who had a game-
high 21 points against Emory &
Henry, went down with the in-
jury to his knee. The Generals
went on to a 64-53 defeat at the
hands of the Eagles.

“With Bridgewater we just
got outplayed,”’ explained Can-
field. “They were very ag-
gressive, we lost our concentra-
tion and we deserved to be beat.

‘Losing Lex would certainly
be a factor,’’ added Canfield,
‘not only in the number of
points he scores, but in the
things he creates with his speed
and quickness.”’

In addition to the hyperex-
tended knee, Fitzenhagen has
possible rotary instability and
cartilage damage, according to
trainer Jim Murdock, who
estimates a two-week absence
for Fitzenhagen.

With Fitzenhagen out, leading
scorer and rebounder John Lee

Sports

Graves had to carry the scoring
load against Bridgewater. The
senior forward was nine of 15
from the floor and had a game-
high 20 points.

Junior guard Kevin McClat-
chey followed Graves with 10
points. No other General had
more than five.

W&L was outshot 59 percent
to 45 percent from the field, but
the team showed typical con-
sistency from the free-throw
line with 87.5 percent shooting.
This percentage had little effect
on the outcome, though, since
the Generals only had eight at-
tempts, compared _ to
Bridgewater’s 25, of which it
made 18.

Despite being slowed by in-
jury, junior forward Shannon
had a game-high seven re-
bounds. He was less effective in
the scoring department,
however, going one for seven
from the field, for two points.

According to Canfield, Shan-
non’s injury is less understood
than Fitzenhagen’s. ‘‘Scott has
got something wrong with his
knee, and we don’t quite know
what yet,” said the 20th-year
coach. ‘‘I think he should be
able to play (against Roanoke)
but he may not be up to full
speed.”

In the demolition of Emory &
Henry in Warner Center a week
ago, the Generals held a 52-23
halftime lead and cruised to the
easy victory.

Emory & Henry shot a miser-
able 39 percent from the floor in
earning the loss.

In addition to Fitzenhagen’s
21 points, Graves had 17 and
junior guard David Wilkinson
added 10.

In preparation for the
Roanoke game, Canfield is try-
ing to come up with a strategy

to offset the injuries. ‘‘Obvious-

ly we’ve got to make some other
plans,” said the coach.

For example, said Canfield,
“‘We’ve got to take better care
of the ball, which we didn’t do
against Bridgewater.

“I’m sure some time or
another with Roanoke we’ve got
to spread the ball out,’’ he add-
ed. ‘‘We sure as heck can’t run
with them.”

Whatever strategies Canfield
comes up with, he has full con-
fidence in his players. ‘‘I think
it should be noted that they’re

not quitters; they have never
quit,” said the coach. “It just
doesn’t enter my thoughts that
they’d ever quit, no matter
what the odds. And I’d say for
the Roanoke game the odds will
be very much against us.”’
Roanoke is led by senior for-
ward Tim Woodson (22 points
per game), one of three players
who averages in double figures.
Following the Roanoke game,
the Generals travel to Lynch-
eg College on Saturday, Jan.

Warner Center was the scene
last Saturday of the Washingotn
and Lee fencing team’s first
regular season meet. The
Generals triumphed over the
University of Virginia for the
second straight year by a score
of 14-13, but fell to Virginia
Tech, 11-16.

Senior Pat Berg and junior
Chuck DePoy led the team
against U.Va, each going 3-0 in
sabre. Sophomore Mike Berg
was 1-2, bringing the sabre
squad score to 7-2.

A strong 2-1 performance
from freshman Steve Holmes
paced the foil squad, while
sophomores Mike Grow and
Lou Mondello finished 1-2 and
1-1, respectively. Freshman
Jeff Blomster was 0-1, giving
the foil squad a 4-5 mark.

The epee squad finished 3-4
with senior Rick Swagler,
sophomore Cotton Puryear and
freshman Charles Grandpierre
all finishing 1-2.

The Generals finished off the
Hoos last year when U.Va was
the Virginia Cup Champion. It
was the first victory over U.Va
since 1941.

The Generals had more trou-
ble with the Hokies of Virginia
Tech. Holmes led the team with
a 3-0 performance, with Grow

A sate bet?

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

...AS you head over to the
Warner Center tonight to watch
The Game (W&L vs. Roanoke
Who?), here are some thoughts
on what the evening’s festivities
might bring. Frankly, the
Generals may be the only
ODAC squad able to unseat the
Maroons. But with the injury to
junior intensity man Lex
Fitzenhagen and assorted other
Generals looking like extras
from an outtake of ‘“‘The Day
After,” the game has a changed
outlook. But there’s no sense
crying over spilled milk. in
Roanoke, W&L will be facing
the No. 4-ranked team in Divi-
sion III, and one that, for the
most part, outmans the
Generals. It would be undeni-
ably a safe bet to go with the
Maroons tonight. To win, W&L,
as it has in all previous vic-
tories, has to be able to
establish its game first, and
then make sure Roanoke does
not settle into its game. A tall
order for even a_ healthy
Generals’ squad. There are,
however, these things to con-
sider. At 10-0 the Maroons have
yet to be tested. As No. 4 in the
country, they, like last year,
have everything to lose. What’s
more, they undoubtedly can’t

help from considering these
facts, either, a sort of self-
inflicted pressure that Coach
Verne Canfield certainly won’t
mind. One final relevant state-
ment: W&L 91, Emory & Henry
49; Roanoke 82, Emory & Henry
68. I’ve never been one much for
safe bets, and I’m sure the good

guys in white aren’t, either....

Time Out...

....Checking other campus ac-
tivity, kudos are extended to the
W&L fencing-club on its im-
pressive weekend performance.
The query from this corner is
how much longer until this
group is justly elevated to varsi-
ty status...

....Tennis is in the sportlight,
once again, as John McEnroe
reaffirmed his claim to the
world No. 1 ranking with his
weekend thrashing of the dour
Czech’ Ivan Lendl. With four
different gentleman taking
each of the four majors, this
year’s Volvo Grand Priz
Masters — a heretofore ex-
traneous post-year playoff
money binge — actually meant
something. All this aside, the
man to watch is the 19-year-old
Swede Mats Wilander, who will

The Washington and Lee
swim team lost a close meet to
Virginia State champion James
Madison University but
defeated Towson State and
Loyola last weekend to even
their dual meet record at 3-3.

The Generals lost at Division
I Madison by a score of 61-52
last Friday night. W&L bounced
back to claim victories against
Towson St. (64-47) and Loyola
(91-20) in a double dual meet
last Saturday at Towson.

Against Madison, W&L divers
Joe Donovan and Matt Devito
placed ist and 2nd on both the
one- and three-meter boards.

Junior Bobby Pearson and
freshman Dan Trice also led the
Generals with outstanding in-
dividual performances last

weekend.

The Generals have lost two
dual meets to Division I and II
teams. Both meets were decid-
ed on the final event. Head
swimming coach Page Remil-
lard noted, though, ‘‘We don’t
get frustrated by being touched
out on the final relay by a Divi-
sion I or II team who is not in
our league.”’

Though the Generals want to ~

do well against Division I and II
teams, their primary concern is
performing well against Divi-
sion III teams.

“This year we want to get
back into the top 20 (Division
III),” said Remillard. ‘Right
now we are in the midst of a suc-
cessful season,’’ he added.

This weekend the Generals
travel to Washington, D.C., to
face Georgetown and Frostburg
State in a double dual meet.

The Washington and Lee
wrestling team returned to its
pre-Christmas form by regis-
tering four victories at two
triangular meets. Last night at
the Davidson College Triangu-
lar, the Generals defeated
Davidson, 34-17, and Pfeiffer
College, 47-12. On Saturday they

swept two at the Loyola College
Triangular, thrashing the hosts,
44-9, and slipping past Johns
Hopkins, 26-20.

Last ‘night’s road victories,
which upped the W&L season
mark to 6-1, were paced by
strong efforts from tri-captains
Tim Valliere, who saw duty at
167 lbs. and 177 lbs., and Jeff

Gee, maybe if Rozier had turn-

before the game begins. So that
leaves us prophets to play the

hate to admit it, the Redskins
look unbeatable. The Redskins
have more weapons than the
Raiders do (watch out — Mark
Moseley had his bad game two
weeks ago), and if Theismann

the Redskins will win.” The
Prince picks it like this: 34-31,
Redskins...

....Finally, this word from the
NCAA: The tournament com-

have the right number, now.”
That sounds good, Dave, until

Undergraduates oppose mak-
ing Washington and Lee a
coeducational institution by a
nearly two-to-one margin, anda
majority is strongly opposed to
such a change, according to a
poll conducted by the Executive
Committee.

The results of Friday’s poll
show that 61.3 percent of the
students responding were
against coeducation, while 36.3
percent said they would favor
it.

Of those, slightly more than
half (50.3 percent) were strong-
ly opposed to admitting women,
while 26.7 percent were strongly
in favor of coeducation.

‘These numbers tell me that
students do not want coeduca-
tion — period,’’ EC President
Robert C. Jenevein said.

“If you look at the two ex-
tremes in the response choices,
you see that some people really
want coeducation, and some
really don’t. Twice as many
people really don’t as really
do,”’ he said.

“Long ago, the EC came out
unanimously against coeduca-
tion,’ Jenevein continued.
‘“‘Now we know the students are
against coeducation, and that
enables us to take much more
definitive steps toward express-
ing student views.

“This gives us more credibili-
ty. We can now be responsive,
as well as responsible.”’

The number voting was 798,

or 59 percent of the undergradu-

ate student body.

That’s a better turnout than
we've gotten in any election,”’
said Jenevein. ‘‘It’s five or ten
points higher than anything
we've gotten before.”

The poll, which was ad-
ministered by sophomore EC
representative James A. White
Jr., consisted of four questions,
three of which were multiple
choice.

Jenevein said computer cor-
relations will be run on the
responses to help the EC inter-
pret the data.

“This will show us the validi-
ty of the trends we think we’ve
identified, and help us to locate
new ones,” he said.

The first question simply ask-
ed if students ‘‘feel W&L should

Washington and Lee University

become a coeducational institu-
tion.”’

The second asked if re-
spondents ‘‘feel coeducation
would improve W&L as an
academic institution.”’

Responses showed that 50.3
percent said coeducation would
not or probably would not
benefit the University, while

Lexington, Virginia

42.4 percent thought it would or
probably would help.

The third question asked
students how committed they
were ‘‘to the traditions and
ideals of W&L.”’

Nearly 60 percent said they
were ‘‘very committed’’;
another third said they were
‘‘somewhat committed”’; 4 per-

President John D. Wilson said
that he has decided to create a
‘‘free-standing’’ computer
science department at W&L.

Wilson made the decision in
response to a report issued by a
faculty committee, which
recommended W&L add a com-
puter science major to the cur-
riculum. The decision as to
whether the computer science
major would be part of the
mathematics department or
controlled by an independent

 

department was made solely by
Wilson, he said.

The faculty as a whole must
approve the curriculum and
degrees, however, Wilson said.

The committee’s report
recommends that both a B.S.
and a B.A. degree in computer
science be offered at W&L. The
B.A. degree would require
fewer credits and would make it
easier for students to double
major in computer science and
a non-science major.

puter science and a non-science

cumulating the number of
credits proposed for the B.S.
degree,’’ the committee
reported.

Fifty credits of work would be
required to receive the B.S.
degree in computer science.
The B.A. degree could be earn-
ed with a minimum of 27 credits
in computer science plus two
additional math courses and
three additional credits from
300-level courses in either
physics, computer science or
mathematics, according to the
committee’s proposal.

ows 60% opposed to coed

cent said they were ‘‘not very
committed”’; and only 18 voters
out of 798 (2.3 percent) said they
were “not at all’? committed.

White said there was ‘‘a
definite trend”’ in the relation-
ship between an_ individual’s
response to the first two ques-
tions and how he answered the

third.
The fourth, an open-ended

question, asked students to “‘list
in order of their importance to
you, those traditions and ideals
of W&L.”

Although responses to that
question have not yet been
tabulated, White said the most
frequent response was ‘‘the
honor system.”

The poll was designed in con-
sultation with sociology Pro-
fessor David R. Novack, who
has supervised previous
coeducation polls at W&L.

“If the majority of students
are opposed to coeducation at
Washington and Lee, I think the
trustees should know about it,’’
Novack said.

Novack identifies himself as

‘‘an advocate of coeducation.’

White says the questions were
meant to be ‘‘flexible,’’ with ‘‘a
wide range of answers’’ offered
to the three multiple choice
questions.

Review and Outlook

Has EC thought ?

The Executive Committee has sometimes been ac-
cused of forming too many subcommittees, of taking
too much time to make decisions and thus of being
largely ineffective at representing student opinions.

A decision the group made this week, though,
perhaps would have benefited from further study. We
refer to the EC’s unanimous vote to recommend
that faculty members require their students to wear
ties.

Whether this policy will decrease student apathy —
which seems to be its purpose — and whether the
faculty will heed the EC’s vote are questions that can-
not yet be answered. Indeed, the wearing of ties by
students might prove to be a good idea.

This decision appears to have been made, though,
with little opportunity for comprehensive study. No
subcommittee was formed, and the only student opin-
ion apparently taken into account was that of the
students in the EC room Monday night.

A subcommittee should have been formed to in-
vestigate student apathy and the possibility of re-
establishing some W&L traditions. Previous subcom-
mittees on such problems as open exams have proven
effective; by talking with faculty, administration and
students, this subcommittee could have developed
some concrete proposals for thwarting student
apathy.

In this way, students would have had an opportunity
to express their opinions regarding student apathy in
general and the wearing of ties in particular.

When EC President Bob Jenevein appears before
the faculty Feb. 6 with the EC’s recommendation, he
purportedly will be representing student feelings on
the issue. In this case, he actually appears to be
representing the feelings of only 10 other students
—the rest of the EC.

Only by taking the time and effort to consider all
possible student reactions to any decision can the Ex-
ecutive Committee be truly representative of the stu-
dent body.

Letters to the Editors

IU complaints disputed

To the Editors:

I’ve always hesitated and
usually refrained from respond-
ing to criticisms of the Ex-
ecutive Committee that appear
in the Phi, feeling that I should
wait for the most destructive
and ill-founded criticisms. Well,
I think they appeared last week
concerning our treatment of the
“Independent Union.’’ In one
article, one commentary, and
one letter, the IU was portrayed
as an oppressed victim of a
fraternity-dominated student
body and student government. I
particularly want to answer the
letter:

1. Mssrs. Cadle and Sarle, the
self-appointed co-chairmen of
the IU, feel they are entitled toa
portion of the $2000 in the EC
funding account because they
are a new group. But as they
themselves pointed out in the
EC meeting, they may not be
around next year or the next.
This new group may soon be a
group of the past. If a new
Camel Watchers Club asked for
several hundred dollars, I
suspect our reaction would be
the same.

2. Mssrs. Cadle and Sarle
think the students who belong to
the IU are entitled to ‘‘see their
money (student tax) used by an
organization in which they par-
ticipdte.’’ I challenge them to
name one organization where
they are not allowed to par-
ticipate.

3. When comparing them-
selves to the Student Associa-
tion for Black Unity, perhaps
the IU should be more realistic.

4. The co-chairmen claim
representation of 40 percent of
the student body. That rests on
one very inappropriate assump-
tion — that all independents
want to have something to do
with the IU. I have personally

encountered many _indepen-
dents who chuckle at the IU,
and only two who take it
seriously. There is no question
that most independents think
they have better things to do
with their time and money.

4. Finally, the leaders of the
IU claim no objection to charg-

ever made to approach the
SAB. Instead, the IU leaders

complain that they will need

charges about $40 a member,
the Fencing Club about $75 per

its belief that real interest will
generate real income. I do not
expect the IU to collect any
dues.

I’m not going to go on and on
about this, but I should remind
our critics that the EC formed a
subcommittee on the problems
of independents before the IU
was formed. The ‘‘Reader’s Ad-
vocate’’ commentary warned
against our prejudice toward in-
dependents, but I’m afraid that
was an unnecessary precaution
and out of place in a column
designed to criticize the

newspaper.

Furthermore, the EC sub-
committee including several in-
dependents, directed Mssrs.

SAB about any changes the IU
thought were needed. What hap-

The question students should
be asking is not ‘‘Why was the
EC so harsh with the Indepen-

still solicits any suggestions for
improving the W&L experience
for independents.

Tradition includes participation

To the Editors:

The attendance at last week’s
Founder’s Day Convocation
was an embarrassment to the
University; I counted fewer
students in attendance than
faculty and guests. Yet every
member of the W&L student
body should have been present,
not only to celebrate our found-
ing, but also to honor the in-
itiates into ODK and to hear
President Wilson’s speech. The
Founder’s Day-ODK Convoca-
tion is one of our greatest tradi-
tions. (Indeed, the ODK order
was founded at Washington and
Lee.) It seems to me that all
arguments against coeducation
from the standpoint of preserv-
ing tradition lose their power if
no one is going to participate in
the tradition.

A similar phenomena oc-
curred Monday night at the
delegate sign-up for the 1984
Mock Convention, It too was

poorly attended. The Mock Con-
vention, like Founder’s Day and
ODK, is one of our greatest
traditions, something we talk
about when discussing our
great heritage. There are a lot
of people at various levels in the
Mock Convention who are work-
ing hard in order to ensure its
success and carry on its tradi-
tion. However, their hard work
will be for naught if no one par-
ticipates, or if participation is
last minute and shallow.

Those who talk about Wash-
ington and Lee’s tradition (as if
they are a part of it) and yet do
not participate in it are, in my
opinion, hypocritical. It is easy
to talk and point, it is another
thing to act. Many people have
noted a general sense of apathy
among the student body at
W&L; the poor attendance on
Founder’s Day and at the
delegate sign-up only serve to
further this perception. If we
really wish to preserve tradi-

tion at W&L, verbal reverence

alone will not suffice; rather,
we must all take part actively.

Low ODK turnout sparks apathy complaints

By MIKE ALLEN

Low attendance at last Thurs-
day’s combined Omicron Delta
Kappa and Founders’ Day
ceremonies has_ sparked
criticism of students’ apathy
and lack of regard for tradition
from faculty, administrators,
and student leaders.

On Jan. 12, Dean of the Col-
lege William J. Watt sent a
letter to the professors telling
them that ‘‘all students and
faculty are asked to attend.”

Coed poll results

(continued from page 1)
“‘We wanted the bare bones of
the issue,” he said. ‘‘We wanted
to keep it as short as possible
while still touching on all the
basic issues.”’

“This poll is a definite indica-
tion of student opinion,” he con-
tinued. ‘‘The turnout shows
that. Everybody really cares
about it.”

EC Vice President David C.
Judge said he thought that
“while a number of polls have
been taken in the past, this is
the best indication of student
sympathies because it was
taken while the students were
informed, aware and concern-

On Jan. 16, Executive Com-
mittee President Robert C.
Jenevein reminded people of
the event, and ‘‘encouraged all
students to attend the ODK-
Founders’ Day convocation.”’

In keeping with tradition, the
administration shortened after-
noon classes, providing a free
period of time for the
ceremonies.

The result, on what would
have been Robert E. Lee’s 177th
birthday, was only a handful of

students aside from those being
“tapped” and an Evans Dining
Hall full of empty seats.

“Don’t lose your capacity for
outrage,” . Said politics Pro-
fessor Delos D. Hughes. “‘I only
believe it because I’ve seen it so
many times before.”’

‘I was embarrassed for the
University to be attempting to
honor people and have the at-
tendance as sparse as it was,”
said Frank Parsons, executive

 

‘“‘We’ve seen more tension in
the student body on the issue at
this time than ever before.”’

Jenevein said he also was
pleased with the results of the
EC undertaking.

“We got a lot of criticism for
the last poll. Thanks primarily
to the publicity which preceded
this poll and James’ efforts,
I don’t expect any valid
criticism of this one.”’

White was ‘‘surprised that the
turnout was as high as it was’’
because of the cold weather and
the time required to fill it out.”

According to Jenevein, all
three polling places were

manned at all times, and White
said the people at the polls were
instructed to encourage pas-
sersby to vote.

“That really helped in the
turnout,” White said. ““We got
them torecruit people to vote.”

Politics department chair-
man William Buchanan, who
wrote the text ‘Understanding
Political Variables,’’ said this
turnout probably gave an ac-
curate reflection of student sen-
timent.

“The problem you have is
whether those who turn out are
representative of those who
don’t,” he said. ‘Obviously
those who are most interested

President Wilson said he
‘“‘would have been pleased to
see more students there.”’

“I think we could do more to
support one another, whether
it’s the basketball team, or
students in recital, or Contact,”
he said.

“We miss something real
when we miss the opportunity to
come together, especially when
that is to celebrate what I have
come to call the great heroes of
this place...

“Whether we know it or not,
we owe a great debt to the
founders of Washington and

Chapter V, Section 3 of the

Bylaws of the University says ,

Founders’ Day ‘‘shall be
observed annually, forever,
with appropriate com-
memorative exercises...

“There shall be a suspension

of all lectures and ordinary ~

University exercises on
Founders’ Day...”

Despite that requirement,
classes are no longer cancelled
on Jan. 19, and Parsons
suspects that attendance would
be even less if they were. ‘At

least now people are on the
Hill,” he said.

At one time, attendance was
not optional.

Through 1969-70, the Catalog
said that a student ‘‘is required
to attend” certain ‘‘compulsory
assemblies.”

From. 1970-71 to the present,
the Catalog says that a student
“is expected to attend.”’

Parsons said the change was
made during the time ‘‘we
thought we'd have a hard time
requiring students to do
anything around here.

“Student attitudes were such
that they were perceived by the
administration as being anti-
establishment. The inclination
on the part of a lot of colleges,
and I think Washington and Lee
participated in that, was back-
ing off from certain re-
quirements.”’

EC calls for ties; exam proposal delayed

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

The Executive Committee
voted Monday night to ask the
faculty on an individual basis to
require students to wear re-
spectable clothes, including
ties, toclass.

But final approval of the open
exam policy was delayed a
week because the entire pro-
posal had not been typed.

The questions of students’
wearing ties to class came dur-
ing a discussion of student
apathy in general. Also discuss-
ed, but without any action
taken, were proposals to com-
bine athletic events and social
functions, publish a ‘‘Blue
Book” of Washington and Lee
traditions, re-establish .a
Boosters’ Club and reaffirm the
- speaking tradition.

' Junior representative Cole
Dawson noted that even if only
60 percent of the faculty re-
quested their students to wear
ties, nearly everyone on the

 

campus would have one on.
“There will be enough people
with ties so that it will become
accepted,’’ Dawson predicted.
Vice president Dave Judge,
who has taken several classes
with Dr. J.D. Futch, who re-
quires ties, said, ‘I’ve found

‘that kids who don’t take it

seriously are few and far be-
tween.”

Jenevein will make his pro-
posal, which was approved
unanimously by the EC, to the
faculty during its Feb. 6
meeting.

Earlier in the meeting, some
infighting between Jenevein
and Secretary Len Howard sur-
faced.

Jenevein first asked Howard
to get the EC minutes posted on
campus sooner. Jenevein said
the minutes of last week’s
meeting hadn’t been posted in
several places until a week
later, and that two items — an-
nouncements of the ODK Con-
vocation and the coeducation
poll — were dependent upon the

minutes being posted.

Then, Howard had typed a
cover letter to Dean Atwood
and Dawson’s nine-point open
exam proposal for the EC to ap-
prove. Jenevein first questioned
several editing changes
Howard made and then chastis-
ed Howard for not typing
another page dealing with the
specific logistics of how exams
would be distributed.

“T want to know why the ex-
tent of the proposal was not
typed up,” Jenevein said. .

Howard said he thought the
EC still had to approve the idea,

* but Jenevein said the idea was

approved last week, and the
logistics needed to be approved
this week.

The issue was tabled for a
week, and Dawson volunteered
to type the rest of the proposal.
After the EC approves the pro-
posal, the Faculty Executive
Committee must make a
recommendation to the whole
faculty.

The Faculty EC, though,
meets on Monday afternoons
and thus will not have an oppor-
tunity to consider the open ex-
am proposal before the next

Also Monday night, the EC
cleared up its budget misunder-
standing with the Student Asso-
ciation for Black Unity as SABU
President Ron Magee agreed to
spend all of the EC’s $1,500
allocation on the SABU ball. A’
budget report presented by
SABU last week showed pro-
jected expenditures of $750 for
the ball and $750 for.a speaker.

Judge said he wanted to en-
sure that organizations spend
EC funds for what they say they
are going to spend them for dur-
ing budget request.

Magee said he was.not aware
the EC had intended the $1,500
solely for the ball. He added
that SABU should still be able to
pay for the speaker, Evonne
Braithwaite Burke, March 22.

The issue of honor relations
with the law school was raised
following the Student Bar
Association’s budget report.
Jenevein asked the SBA mem-
bers whether they felt the honor
system should apply to law
students.

“I think the law students are
partly to blame because they’re

system as they should be.”’

John Sicilian, a second-year
law student who was an EC
representative last year, said,
“The opposition to-the honor
system in the law school is a
vocal minority.

‘*A lot of people question the
idea of their peers — other
students — judging their par-
ticular situation. When you get
into law school, you have more
of a vested interest in staying
there.”’

No action was taken on the
matter.

The EC did approve a letter to
Dean John requesting the crea-
tion of a new staff position, stu-

ported through the university

EC clashes with police over evidence

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

Lexington police have issued
warrants for the arrest of a
former Washington and Lee law
student on 18 felony counts.

Lexington Police Chief L.O.
Sutton said that a black male
from New York City is charged
with the forgery and uttering,
or passing, of nine fraudulent
checks.

“I suspect he is a former
Washington and Lee student,”’
Sutton said. The police chief
characterizes the man as “a
fugitive.”

‘‘We understand he was in
Lexington up until a few days
ago,”’ he said. ‘‘He was living on
University grounds.”

His name has been entered in

Grand jury subpoenas

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

The special grand jury in-
vestigating local drug distribu-
tion has asked the university to
release certain files for use in
the investigation.

‘There have been some docu-
ments subpoenaed, and we're
not sure yet of our response,”
said Dean of Students Lewis G.
John.

He said the records involved
‘‘several’”’ former students.

‘“‘We have a real problem with
balancing the university’s in-
terest and students’ privacy
with a desire to cooperate with
the law and the grand jury,”
Dean John said.

“We want to establish as
university policy on that, and
we have to do that with legal
counsel.

‘“‘We have to comply with cer-
tain requirements of the
‘Buckley Amendment,’ which
prevent unauthorized access to
student files,” he said.

Dean John is scheduled to
testify before the grand jury on
Friday.

The documents were ap-
parently requested through the
office of Commonwealth’s At-

torney John Read.
No subpoenas duces tecum

the National Crime Information
Center computer, and Sutton
says that ‘“‘any jurisdiction that
comes into contact with him has
the right to arrest him and hold
him for extradition.”

He said the suspect is also be-
ing investigated for possible in-
volvement in at least two
burglaries, which would also
carry felony charges.

The police chief confirmed
that the checks were drawn on
the Lexington branch of the
First National Exchange Bank.

Robert P. Diethrich, a
Washington and Lee freshman
who is a customer of FNEB,
said that he had a box of checks
stolen from his dormitory room
during Thanksgiving vacation.

He was aware last week that

(requesting documents) involv-
ing Washington and Lee are on
file with the Clerk of the Court.

On Tuesday, Read gave his
refusal to discuss any aspect of
the investigation.

Clerk of Circuit Court Bruce
Patterson said that 103 different
individuals have received sum-

work on the major in their
sophomore years without any

report said.

The committee estimated
that eight to ten students would
graduate with degrees in com-
puter science each year. That
total would be greater than the
average number of graduates
from 18 of 30 majors at W&L,
the committee said.

The committee reported that
enrollment in 100-level courses
would run between less than 30
students to 70 students in some
courses. Nevertheless, it warn-
ed that these were rough
estimates.

the new courses require a

someone had written five of the

checks for a total of $110.
Sutton said last week that the

case had involved ‘‘a coopera-
tive investigative effort’ with
University officials.

A conflict has arisen between
Sutton and Executive Commit-
tee President Robert C. Jene-
vein over what they both say is
“a piece of evidence’ which
Sutton said is related to the
case.

“It is my understanding that
(the EC) may very well possess
instruments or documents of an
evidentiary nature,’’ Sutton
said. “Depending on how the

case develops, I may be in-

terested in obtaining it.”’

“If they have something of an -

evidentiary nature, I will take

records

monses from the grand jury.

Patterson confirmed that on
Nov. 17, the grand jury sub-
poenaed the long distance
telephone records for the last
two years of three former
Washington and Lee students
who have been convicted on
drug charges.

that possessed by the commit-
tee. With few exceptions, in-
stitutions upon creation of a
computer science program
have experienced enrollment
considerably larger than an-
ticipated — sometimes by fac-
tors of five-eight. Appreciating
the character and disposition of
students electing to attend
Washington and Lee, there will
not be a flood of students into
the program...”’ —

The committee said that it did
believe the addition of the com-
puter science major would have
some positive effect on recruit-
ment of students.

“In the opinion of the (Admis-
sions) office, this new program
would benefit their recruiting
efforts, allowing them to
answer in the affirmative a
question, vis a vis computer
science, that now must be gloss-
ed over with vague statements
about an independent major,”’
the committee said.

Sutton also said that “‘it is not

that I have that piece of
evidence,’’ which he later con-
firmed was ‘‘a document.”’

“TI can get it from somewhere
else,’’ he said.

“By attempting to handle

Darrell offers meal
plan in Cockpit

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

Students (including all
freshmen) on the 20-meal con-
tract plan in Evans Dining Hall
can now eat lunch in the
Cockpit, according to Washing-
ton & Lee University Food Ser-
vice Director Jerry Darrell,
who has been working on this
project for over a year.

The newest innovation in his
attempt to improve variety is
lunch in the Cockpit, which has
two options. The first is the dai-
ly “Contract Special,” which
consists of the sandwich of the
day with chips and a pickle
spear, soup, a
beverage, and a dessert. When
soup is not available, french
fries may be substituted. Sand-
wiches are made to order and a
salad bar may be substituted
for the sandwich.

The second option permits
students to order from the
regular menu and take $1.50 off

the bill, although beer and can-
dy may not be included in the
cash credit.

Darrell feels there are a
number advantages to the
system. ‘‘The (main) idea is to
offer the student some diversi-
ty. We hope it will make our 20-
meal plan more popular,”’ says
Darrell, who also says that the
Cockpit offers a restaurant at-
mosphere for student luncheon
meetings.

On Monday, Jan. 23, the first
day of the new system, 15
students ate in the Cockpit. On
Tuesday, 26 people ate there,
although Darrell expects an
average 40-60 people per day
since hamburgers and pizza,
two of the favorite meals, were
served on Monday and Tues-
day. Darrell will be at the
Cockpit during the first two
weeks of the new system to
decide whether it continues or
stops. ‘‘Chances are it’s going to
(continue],” Darrell said.

Matmen run streak to 5

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
wrestling team ran its winning
streak to five with last night’s
44-6 victory over Virginia State.
The grapplers also took top
honors in the W&L College In-
vitational on Saturday.

After dropping the initial bout
at 118 lbs., the Generals storm-
ed back to win every other mat-
ch. Pacing W&L were Jeff Maz-
za (134 lbs.), Tim Walker (150
Ibs.) and Carlton Peebles
(HWT), who registered pins,
and Larry Anker (142 lbs.), who
won a _ superior decison,
defeating his VSU opponent
31-8.

W&L placed eight wrestlers
in the final round and out-
pointed second-place finisher
Catawba by 29 3/4 points in
Saturday’s Invitational. David-
son finished third, followed by

Lynchburg, Hampden-Sydney,

Elon, the University of the
South, and Pfeiffer.

Larry Anker (134 lbs.) and
Jeff Dixon (190 Ibs.) were the
Generals’ individual cham-
pions. Dixon’s overall record
now stands at 13-0. The other
finalists, all of whom took
second-place finishes, were:
Brian Lifsted (118 lbs.), Jeff
Mazza (126 lbs,), Tim Walker
(142 lbs.), Tim Valliere (167
lbs.), Joe O’Neill (177 lbs.), and
Carlton Peebles (heavyweight).

‘“‘We had a very good team
performance as was indicated
by the eight individuals who
made the finals,’ said head
coach Gary Franke. “Larry
and Jeff, in particular, wrestled
well, but we got good perfor-
mances out of a number of peo-
ple.”’

The Generals see action this
Saturday in a tri-meet at
Washington and Jefferson,
which will also include Hiram
College.

“‘We will be tested this week.
The competition should be good,
and our performance should
give us an indication of just how
good we are,’’ said Franke.
‘They jury is still out, because
we have a long way to go, but I
feel that this team is among the

 

best I’ve ever had here.”’

Cagers bounce back

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

After a heartbreaking loss to
Roanoke a week ago, the
Generals’ basketball team
bounced back to beat Lynch-
burg and Eastern Mennonite

Fencers stab VMI,
look to Virginia Cup

The Washington and Lee fenc-
ing team won Lexington brag-
ging rights with a 15-12 victory
over VMI last Saturday. The
Generals dropped the second
meet of the day to Navy by a
score of 12-15.

The win over VMI leaves the
Generals 2-1 in state competi-
tion with high hopes for the
Virginia Cup Championship on
Feb. 19. The Cup is a five-way

competition between W&L and
the state’s four other fencing
teams: UVa., VPI, VMI and
William and Mary.

The Generals will be taking a
break this weekend for some in-
dividual amateur competition.
The team will be back in action
on the first weekend of Wash-
ington’s birthday break, when
they will travel to Baltimore to
face Johns Hopkins.

this week, raising its record to
10-6, 5-2 in the conference.

And in the continuing story of
“General Hospital,’ the team
learned that second-leading
scorer Lex Fitzenhagen will be
out for the rest of the season
with ligament damage. In addi-
tion, junior guard Mike Hudson
missed Tuesday night’s game
against Eastern Mennonite with
the flu.

With Fitzenhagen out and for-
wards Scott Shannon and Rob
Spencer slowed by injuries, the
Generals seemed to have little
chance against the undefeated,
third-ranked Maroons.

But the 1,100 fans who packed
Warner Center Thursday night
saw an inspired, disciplined
W&L team control the tempo of
the game and fight to a 54-54 tie
with a minute anda half left.

Shannon (10 points, six re-
bounds) took a shot from 10 feet

...A couple of weeks back, I
petitioned, in my usual, mild-
mannered way, for a little more
fan support for Generals’
teams. A week ago, I saw the
typical turnout for a Roanoke-
W&L confrontation. By the time
the last of the spectors had
trickled out, I felt quite disap-
pointed...but not because of the
outcome. Some of us, I believe,
forgot there was a basketball
game being played. What hap-
pened in the Warner Center last
Thursday night simply left a
bad taste in my mouth. The inci-
dent at the end of the game in-
volving Roanoke players and
coaches and W&L fans where
punches were thrown was a sad
occurrence that may only por-
tend greater and more sense-
less acts of violence. I mean, it
is one thing to come out to cheer
for your team, but it is another
species entirely to go out to
belittle another team and its
fans. There are degrees to spec-
tator participation, and there is
no question that the game last
week overstepped those bounds.
A little disrespect is allowable
but activities such as_ the
Unknown Fans (perhaps a good
idea that has turned sour)
sneaking up on the Roanoke
bench during timeouts or their
failing to yield the way to tne
Roanoke cheerleaders lead one
to wonder where W&L fans are
headed. It’s not any coincidence
that Dick Duden, associate
editor of In The Crease
magazine found W&L’s Wilson
Field to be among his most
unpleasant playing places. A
primary reason: the W&L fans
whom he calls ‘‘geeks” and
“unruly drunkards.’”’ What is
probably most distressing
about this situation is that such
criticism may reflect upon a
minority of those attending
W&L athletic contests. But then
again it’s also distressing to
witness the damage a minority

 

 

can do. W&L is supposedly a

      
     
  
  

Fans’

foul

school steeped in a tradition of
honorable behavior and
gentlemanly conduct. It would
be commendable, rather ex-
pected, that some of us might
like to try to live up to that
ideal...

Time Out...

...On to happier colonnade
happenings: The W&L grap-
plers, having the best record of
any W&L winter sports team at
6-1, is to be congratulated on its
impressive domination of
Saturday’s W&L College Invita-
tional, sending eight men to the
finals and outpointing second
place Catawba by 29 3/4 points.
They are giving one of the finest
seasons ever, led by junior 190
man Jeff Dixon who’s
undefeated on the season. Their
only dual meet loss was to Divi-
sion I Duke. The latest Virginia
College Wrestling Coaches Poll
has them 10th, the only Division
III squad to make the rankings.

Should the rest of their slate
follow suit, give this bunch

along with the fifth-ranked
swimmers (Wow!) a nomina-
tion as W&L team of the year...
Of other concern, the General
cagers showed not only a
valiant effort in last Thurs-
day’s to-do with Roanoke but
also a graciousness in defeat;
for while Coach Ed Green and
the Maroons were mixing it up
with the W&L fans, Coach
Verne Canfield’s gentlemen
quietly headed to the locker
room. The Generals showed
some character as they were
able to bounce back to defeat
Lynchburg on Saturday and
Eastern Mennonite on Tuesday.
Perhaps Thursday’s loss, in
which nearly every player filled
his role perfectly, will serve as
a rejuvenating factor for the
rest of the campaign. With
Fitzenhagen gone for probably
the rest of the year, this group is
going to have to know they can
perform without the Super
Swing Man. Performances like
those of late will give them that

 

confidence. Stay tuned.....

that hung on the rim, then fell
into the hands of a Roanoke re-
bounder.

Roanoke’s Shane Abernathy
then hit two clutch free. throws
to give his team the lead, 56-54,
forcing the Generals to score
again.

With 23 seconds left to
Generals called their last
timeout to set up a play to
senior forward John Lee
Graves (game high of 24 points
and eight rebounds).

Covered by three men,
Graves got the ball on the right
side, turned around and threw
in a 15-footer to tie the game at
56 with 10 seconds remaining.

With no way to stop the clock
to set the defense, W&L could do
little more than watch as the
fast-breaking Maroons sped the
ball downcourt, and guard Reg-
gie Thomas (team high 17
points) tossed in an 18-footer
with three seconds left to win
the game.

“I thought every man on the
team played exceptionally
well,” head coach Verne Can-
field said often the game. ‘You
take a guy like Mike Hudson,
who came in in the second half
and just shut down (Roanoke’s
Tim) Woodson...’ Canfield add-
ed as an example.

You’ve got to give our kids a
lot of credit,’’ said the coach.
“I’m extremely proud of them
and I think the whole school
should be.”

Canfield had one worry after
the game — that the team would
experience a letdown against
Lynchburg, Saturday night.

The Generals did experience
somewhat of a letdown, but the
hapless Gnomes, shooting 35
percent from the field and 58
percent from the free throw
line, were unable to take advan-
tage, as W&L won, 46-45.

But in Warner Center Tues-
day night, the Generals strolled
to a 76-56 victory over Eastern
Mennonite.

The Generals again were not

in top form. Graves, with the
second-highest field goal
percentage in the ODAC, was
four of 14 from the floor, but still
led the team with 18 points.

The bright spot for the
Generals was three freshmen:
guard Fred Bissinger and for-
wards Keith Brideweser and
Rob Spencer. As a group, the
three were 12 of 17 from the
field.

Brideweser, in particular,
has been playing well of late. He
shot 10 of 13 from the floor in
this week’s three games.

‘“‘He’s gaining confidence
with every game, and that’s im-
portant’’’ noted Canfield.

Tonight the Generals travel to
Washington, D.C., to take on
ODAC foe Catholic. Canfield
sees a tougher game than the
two teams’ last meeting, when
W&L dropped the Cardinals,
86-70.

W&L closes the month of
January’ with a home game
against Maryville, Monday
night.

Swimmers fifth in poll

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The College Swimming
Coaches Association has ranked
the Washington and Lee swim-
ming team as the 5th best team
in NCAA Division III.

The rankings, released Mon-
day, concluded a_ successful
weekend for the Generals, who
defeated Georgetown (67-41)
and Frostburg State (66-45) in a
double dual meet at George-
town.

“T think it (the ranking) is in-
flated a little,” head coach
Page Remillard said. “It’s

nothing we’re going to try to
live up to. We’re going to try to
live up to our potential.”’
Remillard stands on his state-
ment of last week that the
Generals’ goal is to finish in the

top 20.

The ranking does please
Remillard, however, because it
brings national recognition to
the W&L swim program and ap-
pears attractive to W&L swim-
ming recruits.

Commenting on the Generals
double victory last weekend,
Remillard said, ‘‘We did what
we had to do. (It was) nothing
spectacular.”’

Joe Donovan and Tim Rock
contributed outstanding perfor-
mances in the W&L victories.
According to Remillard,
Donovan dove very well from
the one meter board, while
Rock’s time in the 800-meter
freestyle converted into a per-
sonal best for the same distance
in yards.

The Generals (5-3) will host
William and Mary on Saturday
at 1 p.m. in the Cy Twombly
Pool.

The meet has historical im-
portance because it is the last

time W&L will meet William
and Mary in swimming. The
William and Mary athletic
department has announced that
this is the last year it will offer
swimming as a varsity sport.

“That (meet) is going to be
real tough,” said Remillard.
“‘The teams are well matched.”

The meet may become a
coaching battle as strategy will
be important in deciding the
winner.

Remillard suggested that a
coach may match his better
swimmers against the opposi-
tion’s weaknesses. Remillard
concluded, however, ‘‘I’d like to
go head to head with them.”

University President John D.
Wilson said that he was not sur-
prised by the outcome.

“IT wouldn’t have said that
last spring,” he said. ‘‘This fall,
I have been a little bit taken
aback by the strong tone of the
Opposition to the idea of even
considering coeducation.”’

“I think these are probably
good numbers,’ he said. “I
don’t argue with the result.”’

Wilson said that in com-
parison with a 1980 survey
directed by Dr. Novack, this

poll ‘‘shows a sharpening of the
negative on the issue, and a
lessening of the middle
responses.”’

The EC selected the questions
from 32 Novack used in his
winter, 1980 survey.

Those who are strongly op-
posed to coeducation increased
21 percent over that study,
while total opposition was up 18
percent.

Wilson attributes this to the
fact that ‘‘there are a lot of an-
cillary issues that have clus-
tered around’’ coeducation.

February 2, 1984

 

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
University Board of Trustees
will meet beginning tomorrow
to consider coeducation, next
year’s tuition and other budget
matters.

The 25 members of the Board
will travel to Lexington from
points as far apart as San Fran-
cisco, Tampa and Hartford,
Conn.

This February assemblage is
one of three’ regularly-
scheduled annual meetings of
the trustees.

Friday morning will be
devoted to meetings of the six
committees, and their recom-
mendations will be presented to
the entire Board at its Saturday

 

Trustees to discuss
jcoed issue, budget

session.

Tomorrow atternens. a
special session will be held to
discuss the coeducation ques-
tion.

“The Board, as a Board, has
never had a chance to discuss
the implications of coeduca-
tion,” said University President
John Wilson. “This will be the
beginning of that process.

“An important part of that
meeting will be deciding what,
if any, further directions for
study are warranted.”’

On Oct. 24, following the
Board’s fall meeting, Rector
James M. Ballengee issued a
statement which said that the
trustees had ‘‘asked the Presi-
dent to re-examine the general
question of coeducation in the

EC plans $400, 000
for cost of pavilion

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

The student body will commit
$400,000 toward the proposed
student activities pavilion, the
Executive Committee decided
ina special session Tuesday.

Students will face a $25 stu-
dent tax increase for the next 25
years to finance the expen-
diture. The $400,000 will be bor-
rowed at a 9.5 percent interest
rate, creating a total cost to the
students of $1.06 million.

The Student Activities Board
submitted four plans to the EC
at its regular Monday night
meeting. The least expensive
plan, an 11,960-square foot
pavilion with a 14-foot ceiling,
would cost $519,673. The same
size building with a 24-foot ceil-
ing would cost $582,053.

A second building proposed
would be 14,700 square feet.

With a 14-foot ceiling, it would

cost $600,709, and $677,475 with a
24-foot ceiling.

The Board of Trustees will
vote this weekend whether to
approve construction of a
pavilion, and, if so, whether the
university will finance any ex-
penditures above $400,000.

If the trustees fail to approve
any additional expenditures for
a pavilion, the EC has three
choices, as outlined in the
meeting Tuesday: (1) increase
student taxes even more or for
an even greater length of time
(2) have the architects design a
pavilion that can be built for
$400,000, perhaps without some
of the extras in the plans sub-
mitted this week or (3) drop the
idea.

Athletic Director William
McHenry opposes a_ pavilion

WGL turns over records

Eight students to testify before special grand jury

By JOHN CLEGHORN
Chief Editor

Commonwealth’s Attorney
Beverly C. ‘“John’’ Read’s
special drug grand jury fur-
thered its probe of the
Washington and Lee student
body this week subpoenaing at
least eight students in addition
to University discipline records
of seven other current and
former students.

Although records in the
Rockbridge Circuit Court
clerk’s office show that only two
W&L students have been sub-
poenaed to appear before the
jury Feb. 17, sources close to
the investigation said that at
least six others have been
called to testify that day.

Circuit. Court Clerk Bruce
Patterson said the discrepancy

- could be explained in two ways.

Either the Rockbridge County
Sheriff has been unable to serve
all of the subpoenas or Read has
chosen to subpoena witnesses
without making public record in
the clerk’s office, an™ option
which is open to Read, Patter-
son said.

The eight students, all
undergraduates, are the only
W&L students who have been
subpoenaed to date other than
Executive Committee Presi-
dent Bob Jenevein who has said
he was called because of his
familiarity with the student
body.

Student Control Committee
Charlie Alcorn said he turned
over all the names of students
who had appeared before the
SCC in the last three years, a
total of seven, to Dean of
Students Lewis John. The ma-
jority of the cases involved
students caught smoking mari-
juana in the dormitories, Alcorn
said.

Dean John said the docu-
ments were turned over to Read
on Friday after each of the
students involved was given the
option of signing a release giv-
ing the University the right to

release the documents concern-
ing the SCC action against
them.

Such a release is required by |

the Buckley Amendment which
protects the confidentiality of
student records.

According to Alcorn, four of
the seven former and current
students whose SCC records
were subpoenaed signed the
consent release.

“I think we went a little
beyond the Buckley Amend-
ment,’’ said Dean John of the
release which he termed ‘‘infor-
mally worded.”

After increased media atten-

tion in relation to the grand jury

probe, the University issued the
following statement through
News Office Director Jeff Han-
na:

‘‘The university has
cooperated with the special
grand jury by providing that
grand jury certain records of
the Student Control Commit-
tee.”

Dean John would _ not
speculate whether Read plan-
ned to call more W&L students
to testify, saying Read’s in-
vestigation was unpredictable.
_Jenevein said Wednesday

that no Executive Committee
records had been subpoenaed.

Alcorn said he.expected to be
subpoenaed in relation to his in-
vestigation authority after
Jenevien was called. However,
Alcorn said he learned he would
not be called when Dean John
took over the responsibility of
the SCC records.

During the September _in-
vestigations of former W&L
students William Dederick,
Thomas Rorhig and Marc Ham,
Read possessed a list of approx-
imately 50 names of W&L
students, according to Alcorn.
He said the names were sup-
plied by the convicted students
and gained from the checks
written to them.

Alcorn said he had not spoken
with Read since those investiga-
tions.

Dean John was scheduled to
appear before the jury Jan. 27
but said he did not testify and
that his testimony has been
postponed indefinitely.

In addition to the 11 VMI
cadets who had been sub-
poenaed before this week, nine
more cadets have been added to
the witness list, according to
circuit court records.

Review and Outlook

The media blitz

In less than a week, Washington and Lee has been
catapulted into the national news following the Ex-
ecutive Committee’s vote to ask the faculty to require
students to wear ties toclass.

What has followed from this seemingly simple pro-
posal has been a perfect example of how the media
determine what is news. The story which originally
was on page four of The Ring-tum Phi found its way
into the Roanoke Times and World News, the Rich-
mond Times-Dispatch, and the Washington Post. It
did not stay a regional story for long, though, as the
Associated Press carried it as well as United Press
International. The dissemination of the story has
grown in geometric proportions as more newspapers
see other newspapers covering it.

Since the approval of the request to the faculty the
EC and Student Body President Bob Jenevein have
been deluged with telephone calls from the media.
Just this week, Jenevein has been interviewed on
WRC, a Washington, D.C. radio station, and WMCA, a
New York City radio station. Wednesday morning he
was contacted by a representative of ABC-TV’s
“Good Morning, America’ about a possible ap-
pearance.

We find it surprising that the national media has
found to be news the simple question of whether or not
students at a small, liberal arts university in a small
Southern town should wear neckties to class.

Perhaps the key to the situation lies in the context.
Here at W&L the idea was taken as the serious pro-
posal it was intended to be. But what about the
perception of the issue by the national media?
Chances are they think it’s cute or novel. ‘‘What will
those W&L boys think of next?’’

When this story is placed next to stories of violence
in Beirut and fighting in El Salvador, it probably
seems petty and trivial. This is where the harm may
lie.

Free publicity is a wonderful thing, provided it is
good publicity. We are afraid, however, that this
media blitz may associate the name of Washington
and Lee with pettiness and triviality, disregarding the
school’s fine academic reputation and time-honored
traditions. This publicity may not be free after all.

Tradition may hint insecurity

To the Editors:
The recent action by the EC
urging the professoriate, on an

_ individual basis, to consider re-

quiring the wearing of neckties
in class is the latest of a series
of ‘tradition’ revivifying pro-
posals aimed at reducing ‘‘stu-
dent apathy,” among other
things. Some of these seem to
have the additional effect of
casting doubt upon the con-
fidence of those who most vocal-
ly and stridently support the
University.

These supporters would make
us know how much we should
respect the “traditional” (a
cliche in all of its declensions by
now) aspects of this school and
nearly everything ever
associated with it, however
vaguely. They do this in gravely
worded letters to the Phi, IFC
announcements and, most
evidently, in EC proposals and
decisions. They stress the
seriousness of long-standing in-
stitutions and the necessity of
their continued veneration.

It seems, though, that this is
done in increasingly less poetic
than commercialistic language
(Mock Convention official sta-
tionery: ‘‘Seventy. six years of
authenticity,” Rather like a

turer) and media (painters’
caps advertising ‘‘fine
gentlemen since 1749”). These
and other related items, like
bumper stickers directing us,
while ‘thinking Mink,” to read
the “U.S. News and World
Report” and to remember our
duty in making ‘‘better women’’
are, to some degree, ostensibly
humorous. Even so, these may
suggest something like in-
security in some of the self-

appointed guardians of our
legacy who aid their prolifera-
tion.

Comparisons to Harvard,
Yale and U.Va. only seem to
add to what may be seen as sort
of a communal inferiority com-
plex. Does one ever hear of
Washington and Lee spoken of
in a Harvard quad, a Princeton

dining club or at one of the
libraries at Duke? This practice
of comparison is, regrettably,
carried in the opposite direc-
tion, as shown at the recent
Roanoke game by the embar-
rassing behavior of W&L fans,
some of whom chanted, ‘“‘Some
day you’ll_work for me!’’ at

EC is ‘misguided’

To the Editors:

I am increasingly offended by
my fellow student leaders on
this campus, in particular the
president and members of
Washington and Lee’s Ex-
ecutive Committee. Their
misguided sensibilities and
warped logic continually disillu-
sion me with regards to the
kinds of students Washington
and Lee is producing.

The Student Body President
speaks of an eagerness to help
the independent students of this
campus, yet writes a commen-
tary with little tone of com-
promise. The EC speaks of an
eagerness to boost morale and
displace rampant student
apathy on this campus, yet they

-insult the President of the

University by questioning his
right to make suggestions to the
student government.

The EC sees the revitalization
of traditions as the way to re-
juvenate this campus. Certain-
ly, no one can quibble with the
principal traditions at W&L;
this institution is built on tradi-
tions of excellence. We needn’t
however, wallow in them either.
Dress codes, assimilation com-
mittees, and the like belong to
an era dead twenty years.

Bringing back 1964 won’t help
this campus, looking to the
future will. I urge the EC to
follow this course rather than
the one they are navigating.

Race detail

wmproper

To the Editors:

Page 5 of The Ring-tum Phi,
of January 26, is devoted to the
criminal records of “former
Washington and Lee students.”’
One of these students ‘is a black
male; the others have no race
or sex at all.

Does this distinction reflect
Chief Sutton’s attitudes? Is it
one that will help this communi-
ty apprehend a felonious fug-
itive? Or is the distinction be-
tween “black males” and
“students”? an index to racial
attitudes — inbred, unthinking
and cruel — that bring dishonor
on us all?

A ‘No’ vote for neckties

To the Editors:

Neckties do not gentlemen
make, and, with all due respect
to Dr. Futch, it is not the
responsibility of the faculty to
even suggest, much less dictate
what student dress standards
should be.

That the student government
would waste its time on such ir-
relevant superficialities is a sad
comment in itself, but taking in-
to account that this is 1984 and
Ronald Reagan is President,
the absurdity of asking some-
one else to enforce your rules
for you on a subject as trivial as
this doesn’t seem out of tune
with the times.

I am heartened that those
budding bureaucrats on the EC
had enough vision to recognize
the unfortunately deceased con-
dition of one of W&L’s more
meaningful traditions, the
custom of speaking on campus.
Much warm air gets moved
around here extolling the vir-
tues of our ‘community,’ but
that will continue to be no more
than mere hokum until students
learn to behave cordially
toward one another as well as
others on campus.

Beyond the borders of our
alleged utopia, general local
perception of W&L students has
plenty of room for improve-
ment, but we can’t hope too
realistically for this to change
until we have our own house in
order. I find it hard to argue
with people who look upon the
stereotype of the W&L student
as part of a gang of loud-,
smart- and foul-mouthed thugs
speeding through town and
country, tossing imported beer
bottles out of their BMWs.

So, to approach the general
problem of student deportment
from an angle of appearances
rather than more substantive
issues of common decency in
behavior is rather myopic, and
ultimately dangerous. What
will be next? Haircut regula-
tions? Prohibition of non-
designer jeans on the Colon-

nade? I can only suggest that
anyone needing such specific
guidance in determining their
lifestyle might be more comfor-
table at the school further north
on Letcher Avenue, where
they’ll even tell you what to eat
at every meal.

Opinion

Colvin sees resumption as crucial to NATO's future

By NELSON PATTERSON
Staff Reporter

The suspension of
intermediate-range nuclear
arms talks between the Soviet
Union and the United States
threatens the NATO alliance
and gives the Soviet Union an
advantage in the propaganda
war for Western Europe, ac-
cording to politics Professor
Milton Colvin. Colvin sees a
resumption of the talks —
though not necessarily in the
near future —as the only way to
avert a breakup of NATO and
guarantee a free Western Eur-
ope for generations to come.

“The intermediate range
talks are the most important
talks,’ Colvin said in a recent
interview. ‘With hesitation by
the Dutch government to posi-
tion the (Pershing and cruise)
missles, as well as the prevail-
ing sentiments in West Ger-
many against the missiles, the

..competence of the alliance is

called into question. A collapse
of the alliance would give the
neutralist movement in Europe
an impetus. ;

the defense of Europe is im--

possible without the defense of

Unspoken
out of the

by MARKHAM SHAW PYLE
Phi Columnist

Universities generally, and
this one in particular, have a
tendency toward self-righteous-
ness at times. Indeed, there are
times when only the news
business preens itself more
readily than does Academe.
One of our most cherished
myths is that of academic
freedom.

I call it a myth because it is
one: the distance between reali-
ty and its representation is
dizzying. Let me give you a few
examples. Some months back,
WLUR-FM and Cable IX co-
sponsored a debate on the ques-
tion of coeducation. It was fair-
ly well attended. But there were
members of the faculty and the
staff of this University who
were conspicuous by their
absence. They were absent
because they were afraid. A
tyranny of opinion has
established itself upon the cam-
pus. And there are those who
oppose in their hearts the
changes they fear are in-
evitable; but they dare not
speak. Not even tenure is an im-
pregnable defense, and they
know it. How many times I have
been commended by night for
my stance against the In-
novators; and always com-
mended off the record, by those

West Germany,” Colvin added.
“As Sir Alfred Mackinder
(British politician and theorist)
noted, he who controls Ger-
many controls Europe.”’

To get the intermediate-range
talks resumed, Colvin ad-
vocates deploying the remain-
ing missiles (primarily cruise
missiles) offshore. He noted the
willingness of the Navy to com-
ply with such a plan as well as
the Soviets’ promise to begin
deployment of their version of
the cruise aboard Soviet subs
off the east coast of the United
States. The accuracy of the
missiles, whether fired from
sea or shore, is the same.

“The point of any resumption
of the talks, though, is to avoid
or evade a nuclear war. After
all, as the old saying goes, ‘If
the enemies are talking, then
they’re not shooting,’ ”’ he said.

The time factor involved in
the talks also is important in
Colvin’s eyes. The Strategic
Arms’ Reduction Talks
(START) are not as important
to the alliance as are the
intermediate-range talks. ‘We
may face ugly choices, if the in-
termediate talks don’t resume,
like the collapse of NATO. That
may come in the form of the
Europeans asking us to leave or

who dare not speak out. If our
faculty and staff were to choose
a patron saint today, it might
very well be Nicodemus.

The president, with the hones-
ty we have come to expect of
that gentleman, admits that
there is unspoken opposition
which dare not speak out. But
he is at a loss, we are all ata
loss, to do anything about it.
Perhaps it is insoluble. But it
seems to me more as if we have
found the solution difficult and
left it untried.

My View

 

 

We must not underestimate
the deadly seriousness of the
blight which threatens the in-
tellectual life of our University.
This brute tyranny of opinion is
a direct attack upon the fun-
damental intellectual right of
disagreeement. That right is
jealously safeguarded because
it assures the continuance of
debate and leaves a niche for
Loyal Opposition. Academe is
well aware that majorities are
all too often dead wrong about
essentials; and has always kept
at least a ghetto set aside for the
minority. After all, in fifteen

the American public not being
willing to sustain the burden of
defending Europe,” said Col-
vin.

A return to the control table,
however, should not be an act of

“If we want a credible de-
fense in Western Europe, we
need better quality U.S. troops
in Western Europe, especially if
we decrease the size of our
presence there. We need a
credible conventional deter-
rence if we submit to a build-
down of our nuclear ability. We
must not give up our credibili-
ty,” hesaid.

“The quality of the U.S.
troops is poor in Western
Europe, a ‘hollow army’ in the
words of the former Chief of the
Army. If we build-down nu-
clear, we must build-up conven-
tional forces. We have a simple
choice: either to live with the
Soviet Union or die with the
Soviet Union. I think sane peo-
ple will choose to live with the
Soviet Union,” he said.

Colvin sees a certain danger
in the continued emphasis on
nuclear warfare in the Euro-
peantheater.

‘Don’t let them fool you. The
present policy of the United
States calls for the use of
nuclear weapons. That is the

opposition must come
closet for the fight

years we may have to admit
they were right. Universities,
like successful religions,
always hedge their bets.

The whole tenor of academic
life relies upon the freedom to
follow offbeat premises to a
starkly unpopular conclusion.
That right is threatened by an
enforced homogeneity of
thought on any matter;
especially ones so pressing as
coeducation and the other New
Improved Ideas. The thing is
dangerous if it arises more or
less spontaneously, as when,
periodically, professordom in-
dulges in one of its frenzied,
lemming-like moves to the left.
But here, given the scope of the
unspoken opposition, that is
unlikely. Rather, it seems pro-
bable that the tyranny was
more enforced than embraced.
And this is more than distress-
ing.

If there are men who are so
determined to Innovate that
they are attempting to enforce
an unnatural agreement on the
issues; men who then attempt
to daunt and persuade by
representing this agreement as
the fruit of consideration: let
them be warned. Theirs is a
form of sly dishonesty which
would not long be tolerated of a
student here. I see no reason
why the Innovators should be
allowed to behave thus.

The Ring-tum Phi, February 2, 1984, Page 3

U.S. policy,” he noted. ‘If what
I say is not acceptable to the
hard-liners, then what they
want must be war. Folks like
the Conservative Caucus and
Richard Viguerie have never
heard a shot fired in anger. I’ve
lived through a war. I have
heard those shots. The hard-
liners are just a nitwit faction.
Let’s not try to placate them.
Let’s run them over.”

Can the United States trust
the Soviet Union? No, says Col-
vin.

“Can they trust us? No. We’
operate in an environment of
mutual distrust. It is difficult to
negotiate in that sort of environ-
ment. I say we can trust the
Soviet Union to the extent that
they do not wish nuclear war
and they can trust us to the ex-
tent that we do not want a
nuclear war. On that flimsy
thread hangs the business of the
whole negotiations.”

According to Colvin, the
Soviets’ leaving the negotiating
table has furthered their goal to
split the United States from the
Western Europe.

“The aim of the Soviet Union
is to separate the United States
from Western Europe, and they
achieved that by walking out of
the talks. It was a smart move
on their part,” said Colvin.

Warning against hopes for an
early resumption of discus-
sions, Colvin nevertheless sees
a return as inevitable.

“The date is not so important.
If we rush to the talks, and we
accomplish nothing, the people
will be let down. There is
always a next time, and in this
case, I believe there will be
many next times,”’ he noted.

“I don’t foresee a new cold
war. No new arms race,” he
said, turning in his chair and
leaning back a bit. ‘‘In the cold
light of dawn, neither side
wants it.”

Arms talks break-up gives USSR advantage

capitulation on the part of the

{ United States, Colvin argues.

“We shouldn’t let the USSR
set the terms for negotiations.
The only meaningful negotia-
tions need trade — give and
take, so to speak,” he said.

The question of Soviet com-
piance with any treaty or agree-
ment reached at the talks
presents Colvin with many
questions. He wonders whether
the United States can better its
ability to-monitor compliance.
Whether the United States
should even participate in talks
with a nation which has shown
flagrant disregard for past
treaties does not bother Colvin.

“Breaking the talks for
whatever reason means losing
Europe. One is a risk, the other
a certainty. I doubt the
American public would support
Ronald Reagan (were he to
withdraw from negotiations) ,”’
Colvin said.

For Colvin, arms talks do not
mean forfeiting security. Quite
the contrary, Colvin views arms
talks as building security not
found in’ weapons of mass
destruction.

“In his most recent book,
“Real Peace,” Richard Nixon
argues that peace equals deter-
rence and deterrence equals
peace. I agree,’’ noted Colvin.

But does Colvin agree with
Ronald Reagan that deterrence
means a buildup of the arsenal?
No.

“But to me, deterrence
means a build-down,” he said.

Colvin noted that the Mutual
and Balanced Force Reduction
(MBFR) talks, which have been
taking place in Vienna for near-
ly 15 years, ought to be em-
phasized in the strategic plan-
ning of the United States. Colvin
supports a reduction of Ameri-
can troops in Western Europe,
but only on the condition that
the draft is reinstituted in the
United States.

Superdance raises $7,000 over $28,000 goal

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity raised $35,264 for the
Muscular Dystrophy Associa-
tion at the university’s sixth an-
nual Superdance, which was
sponsored by Miller Beer and
held last Friday, Saturday and
Sunday in Evans Dining Hall.
The total surpassed this year’s
goal of $28,000 and last year’s
total of $33,500.

Money was raised by dancers
collecting pledges, ticket sales,
raffles, food and beverage
sales, pie throws and a pre-
Superdance slave auction.
Those who sponsored dancers
will be billed directly by
M.D.A., and W&L normally
“thas a great collection rate,
close to 90 percent,”’ according
to Chris Williams a junior who
served as Superdance chair-
man along with seniors
Markham Pyle and Rick de
Alessandrini.

  

Ke

uccdays

Dance registration opened at
5 p.m. Friday with actual danc-
ing beginning at 8:15 p.m. The
event lasted for thirty hours, di-
vided into 45 minute dance ses-
sions and 15 minute breaks
along with a two-hour sleep
break Saturday morning.

The dance featured four
bands: Bryce Street, Steps, the
Spark Plugs and Casper, as well
as a number of special events,
including games and pie
throws.

‘Special events were great,”’
said Williams, who felt that the
pie throws, especially the one at
President Wilson, ‘‘were a big
draw.”

“We had asked him (Presi-
dent Wilson) originally, and he
thought he would have a
schedule conflict...but his
schedule worked out.”’

Wilson drew $1,406 from a
number of student organiza-
tions, with Executive Commit-
tee President Bob Jenevein
selected to throw the pie. Others

who had pies thrown at them
were Major John J. Mears and
Colonel David F. Fowler from
the military science depart-
ment, Commerce School Pro-
fessor Delos D. Hughes, English
Professor George W. Ray,
Coach Mervin J. Stickley, jour-
nalism Professor Robert J.
DeMaria and senior Pete White-
head.

The Superdance was accom-
panied by a marathon radio
broadcast over campus radio
station WLUR by Bob Halloran,
Taylor Hathaway and Jim
Strader, which included live
broadcasts from the Super-
dance.

“‘We raised over $150 on the
phone, which is a first,’’ said
Williams about the radiothon.

M.D.A. poster child Joshua
Cross and his mother met with
the dancers and participated in
a question and answer session
which Williams termed ‘‘very
inspiring.”

‘Muscular dystrophy is a
dramatic experience for the
family as well (as the person af-
flicted). The dancers got to see
how much things actually
cost,’’ said Williams, in
reference to the purchase of a
$4,000 wheelchair from Cross.

Cross and other area resi-
dents will be aided by all of the
money raised by W&L, which
last year raised the largest con-
tribution per capita among col-
leges which held a Superdance.
This year’s dance was made
successful mainly through the
efforts of the 53-member steer-
ing committee and 159 dancers
from W&L and other local col-
leges.

For the fourth straight year
W&L student Mike Wyatt col-
lected the most money ($5,000),

followed by Jet Taylor and VMI
cadet Chris Hinton.

Williams, who will chair next
year’s Superdance committee
was especially grateful for the
efforts of faculty advisor Fon-
taine Bostic, who has helped the
dance every year.

‘She does so much for us, and
advises us on a number of
things. She helps us _ year
round,”’ he said. ‘Ricky and
Markham (also) did a super
job.”

All of these people were cited
during the remarks at the con-
clusion of the 30-hour dance-a-

thon. Also cited was Wendy
Turner, the M.D.A. worker who
assisted the steering commit-
tee. Jerry Darrell, food services
director, also was thanked for
his help during the dance. Clos-
ing remarks were made by the
tri-chairman and Dean Lewis
John.

‘Who said Washington and
Lee students are apathetic?”
Dean John queried.

The 1984 Superdance raised
nearly twice as much as the
$17,000 collected by the first
Superdance five years ago.

Open exam decision
put off until March

The proposed open exam
policy, approved by the Ex-
ecutive Committee Thursday,
has run into another hitch,
delaying faculty action until
March 5 at the earliest.

Because a quorum was not
present at Monday’s Faculty
Exectuive Committee meeting,
no vote on the proposal could be
taken. The Faculty EC must act
on the matter before it goes to
the faculty as a whole.

The. student EC called a
special session Thursday to ap-
prove the final proposal and did
sO unanimously. Sophomore
representative Ken Lindeman,
junior representative Darby
Brower and vice president
Dave Judge were absent.

Junior representative Cole
Dawson, chairman of the open
exam subcommittee, said he
received ‘‘a very positive
response and some constructive
criticism”’ from the faculty EC.

eS OS PD WD ee

“Overall, they thought it was
pretty direct and had some good
arguments in favor of the (open
exam) system,’’ Dawson said.

He added, though, that the
members felt it would be better
not to rush a decision this week
and to study the proposal for a
couple of weeks.

The EC, Monday, scheduled a
special meeting Sunday at 7
p.m. to consider any amend-
ments or corrections to the open
exam proposal.

As approved Thursday, the
proposal would allow students
to take an exam during any ex-
am time without notifying the
professor beforehand and with-
out designating a time on the
exam envelope.

KC clarifies request for
neckties on the Hill

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

Following a week of publicity,
the Executive Committee Mon-
day clarified and toned down its
request that individual faculty
members require students to
wear ties to class.

“The Executive Committee
does not presume the authority
or the ability to reinstate or en-
force a dréss code of any kind,”’
read a statement approved
unanimously by the committee.
“Our intent...is to encourage
students to dress respectably

and to encourage faculty to -

recognize their privilege of con-

trol in the classroom.”
EC President Bob Jenevein
said the statement was

prepared in consultation with
the other members of the com-
mittee. It was read and ap-
proved with no discussion.

The EC also voted 11-1
against coeducation (Secretary
Len Howard voted for coeduca-
tion) and unanimously for
spring term and Wednesday
night parties.

A $100 loan was approved for
the re-establishment of a
boosters’ club. Ed Buttarazzi,
who requested the funds, said
the money would be for alumni
mailings and promised to pay it
back by March 5.

“‘We’re trying to decrease the
apathy that’s apparent on cam-
pus,’ Buttarazzi said. ‘“‘We’re
looking for any kind of sup-
port.”’

Action on a proposed student
advisor system was tabled until
Monday following a report by
senior representative Jim

Messer of his subcommittee’s
work. Messer developed an
eight-point plan that calls for
EC selection of student ad-
visors, who would be able to
help students, especially
freshmen, in course selection.

In a cover letter to EC
members, Messer emphasized
that student advisors would be
intended to complement, not
replace, faculty advisors and
dormitory counselors. Messer
said dormitory counselors and
faculty advisors often do not
have enough time to devote to
counselling.

‘‘Last year, there were a lot of
freshmen who didn’t know what
to. expect,’’ sophomore repre-
sentative James White said. ‘I
think this system really will be.
a great thing, especially for
freshmen.”’

The EC did approve a letter
requesting a student organiza-
tion secretary to assist with typ-
ing and filing. The secretary
would be paid from university
funds.

Also Monday night, the EC
heard budget reports from:

— The Mock Convention,
which reported having raised 77
percent of its budget. Co
chairman Peter Muller said
openings still were available on
many state delegations, and
that ‘‘there’s no specific time
requirement’’ for delegates to
the convention. The Mock Con-
vention also will sponsor a fund-
raising pavilion party Feb. 25.

— The Emergency Loan Com-
mittee, which reported 16
outstanding loans for a total of
$1,666. Three loans are current,
and 13 are past due.

Fiji regroups,

By COTTON PURYEAR
Staff Reporter

After losing recognition as an
active social fraternity last fall,
Phi Gamma Delta’s future
looks optimistic, according to
co-president Tom Fellin.

According to Dean of
Students Lewis John, the with-
drawal of recognition was the
result of accumulated social
misconduct offenses over the

_years. The Student Affairs

Committee withdrew recogni-
tion immediately after an addi-
tional offense while the fraterni-
ty was on social probation in-
volving an incident involving
the Hamden-Sydney College
mascot.

With backing from their na-
tional organization, Fiji was
granted an appeal from the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee. Fiji’s
Alumni House Corporation
presented a plan to the commit-
tee for een out the pro-

blems at the house. The SAC ac-
cepted the plan and turned over
the chores of disciplining Fiji to
the House Corporation.

The House Corporation’s first
action was to set up the Alumni
Board of Control, according to
Richard Sessoms, faculty ad-
visor to Fiji. This board consists
of Fiji alumni in the general
area, and they became respon-
sible for all actions taken by Fi-

ji. The Alumni Board reviewed
each brother and pledge on an
individual basis to determine
whether or not he was deserv-
ing of any disciplinary action.
As a result of this review, 16
members were punished. Three
members were expelled from
the chapter but remain
members of Phi Gamma Delta
on a national basis. Five were
suspended from the house for a
time period ending between the
end of March and the end of
June. The expelled and sus-
— members are not allow-

if their behavior warrants such
action.

The Alumni Board also felt a
change in leadership would be
helpful, Fellin said. The Alumni
Board selected six brothers to
fill the leadership positions and
those brothers decided among
themselves who would assume
the different Cabinet positions.
Fellin and Alex Castelli were
chosen to serve as ‘‘co-pres-

“There is no resentment on

Fellin said. ‘Everyone is show-

there is a big group effort in
everything we do.”

“No expenditure over $100
can be made by Fiji without the
approval of the Alumni Board of

‘“‘We have 11 pledges and hope

“Their involvement will go a
long way to offset the largest
part of the budget increase,
which is faculty salary,”’ Wilson
said.

Wilson said that based on the
faculty committee’s estimates,
approximately $37,000 worth of
laboratory software would have
to be purchased for the new
department. The most expen-
sive item to be added is a
microcomputer laboratory,
Wilson said.

Wilson said this increase
represented a very small part
of the university’s total budget
and will not precipitate a major
increase in tuition.

“‘We’ll be able to work out an
intelligent program over time,”’
Wilson said. “I think it’s ab-
solutely necessary.”

Wilson noted it was possible
that student interest in the com-
puter science department
might increase over the years

and upset current plans for the
department. He added that a
major upgrading of the main
computer scheduled for 1985
also will increase the universi-
ty’s capacities.

Wilson said he sees value in
computer science both as a
separate major and as part of
double majors. The B.A. degree
in computer science, which re-
quires fewer credits than the
B.S., will be more accessible to
double majors, noted Wilson.

“I do believe it has intellec-
tual substance and merit on its
own. I really look forward to
this development, and I hope
our attempt to find a good
senior person to head the
department will be successful,”
Wilson said.

‘Uncommon Valor’ too common

By EDDIE CURRAN
Staff Reporter’

You're eight years old, and
you're waiting outside the theater
for your friend’s mother to come
pick you_and your three best
friends up. Ya'll have just seen
Tex Cobb's "Uncommon Valor,
and ya'll are kicking each other
with your P.F. Flyers. Your
friend says, “I’m Tex,” and you
say, ‘No, I'm Tex,” and then you
kick him to prove it.

Up drives Johnny’s mother. She
lets down the back window of the
station wagon and ya'll climb in.
“Did ya'll like the movie?” she
asks.

“It was the best movie I've ever
seen.”

“There's no way it was better
than Billy Jack.”

“It was the fourth best movie
I've ever seen. I liked Billy Jack
better, and Blackbeard’s Ghost,
and Papilon better too. But I want
to see it again tomorrow.”

review:

The creative explosion which
ultimately became Uncommon
Valor occurred when some
screenwriter, told to write a
script based on Bo Gritz’s re-
cent failed POW rescue mission
— and told to make it snappy,
decided to stir in a little Dirty
Dozen. The results are nothing
less than predictable. The
movie begins as Gene Hack-
man, in anguish over his miss-
ing son, gets snubbed by insen-
sitive politicians. A man’s gotta
do what a man’s gotta do, so
Gene goes knocking on the
doors of all his son’s former Ar-
my buddies. At first, each
refuses -— ‘‘Don’t go layin’ a
guilt trip on me, man,”’ — but to
Gene and ourselves, who know
better, they sound like Gilligan
saying, ““You can’t make me,
you can’t make me.”’ Gilligan
did wear the dress (he probably
wanted to), and these guys, ina
display of nothing less than un-

 

‘the movie totally self-destructs

..there is no tension,

only

viewer apathy by the rescue’

 

I’ll stop now. If 1 go any fur-
ther, I might accidentally
radiate the idea that this movie
is so full of basic, childlike
pleasures (see E.T.) that, even
though we’ve become mature,
intelligent young adults, we’ll
still cherish it for its refreshing
innocence and numerous explo-
sions. So I’m putting a stop sign
on Memory Lane in order to put
Uncommon Valor in a more pro-
per, and therefore more nega-
tive, perspective. Here’s the

common valor, join Gene.

Once decided, they go ‘‘north
of Galveston” to an exact
replica of the Vietnamese
prison camp. The camp, as with
all of the expenses, is paid for
by a wealthy businessman, who
is also missing a son. As the
wealthy businessman, Robert
Stack really inhabits this role,
in much the same way he in-
habits every role. At the end,
when he flashes a_ winning
smile, thus discarding his

stoney image for a moment, we
come to understand why he
keeps that smile in check
whenever possible.

But the scenes at the camp
are easily the movie’s best.
Here, the members of Gene’s
brigade are introduced to the
audience so that we'll care
when they die, or be relieved if
they live. And if Uncommon
Valor has one strength, it’s that
these characters are all
likeable and portrayed good
naturedly. Especially Tex
Cobb. While he is big, ugly and
stupid, he’s also pretty funny,
as when he does his herky-
jerky-kung Fu — Martin Sheen
in Apocalypse Now, before he
chops the mirror dance. If Mr.
T had Tex’s personality maybe
I’d watch the “A-Team.”

But the movie totally self-
destructs when they arrive in
Asia. There is no tension, only
viewer apathy, by the time of
the grande finale rescue. This
Vietnam is very green and very
empty of Vietnamese, and it
would be very easy to win a war
here. When some Vietnamese
finally do appear, it’s only to
run around and get blown up;
there is not one bit of dialogue
or one close-up of the enemy.
The actual rescue has no
method or clarity at all, just a
Chinese fire drill with
fireworks. Worst of all, the
movie loses its sense of humor
when it leaves Galvaston. Just
obligatory problems, obligatory
deaths and obligatory POW’s
who look too much like
obligatory actors trying to look
emaciated and spaced-out. —

So should you go see
Uncommon Valor? Assuming
you’ve cone your homework,
checked the TV Guide for
anything better and you enjoy
just sitting ina theatre, maybe.

Two plays presented
by University Theatre

By BOB BRYANT
Staff Reporter

The University Theatre will
present two one-act plays that
differ greatly in tone this
Wednesday and Thursday, Feb.
8 and 9, at 8 p.m. in the
Troubador Theatre.

The first, Woody Allen’s
‘“‘Death Knocks,” is a satirical
comedy. ‘‘What Allen does is
take our greatest fear, death,
and reduce it to a comic situa-
tion,’ said Brian O’Riordan,
who is directing the play. Nat
Ackerman, the protagonist, will
be played by Robert J. Whann
IV. Todd Harvey will star op-
posite him as Death.

The second play, ‘‘The In-

former’’ by Bertold Brecht, is
far more somber. Taken from
Brecht’s ‘‘The Private Life of
the Master Race,’ the play tells
the story of .a couple whose son
is a member of the Hitler
Youth.

“Brecht gives us a warning
that is-as clear today as it was
in Germany during the late 30s:
‘No one is safe,’ ” said director
Chris Lillja. The cast includes
Frank King as the servant,
Chris Cartmill as the husband,
Elizabeth Ray as the wife and
Tom Ziegler as the boy.

Both plays are _ being
presented as part of Professor
Albert Gordon’s directing class.
Reservations are required and
admission is free.

 

‘Kagemusha’ to be

here this weekend

The Washington and Lee
University Film Society will
show ‘‘Kagemusha”’ (‘‘The
Shadow Warrior’’), directed by

- Akira Kurosawa, as its next

presentation on Friday and
‘Saturday, Feb. 3 and 4.

The film, which won the 1980
Cannes Film Festival Grand
Prize, will be shown at 8 p.m.
both evenings in Classroom A of
Lewis Hall, the Washington and
Lee law school building. There
is no charge for admission and
the public is invited to attend.

“‘Kagemusha’”’ is set in 16th-
century Japan and concerns a
powerful warlord and his dou-
ble, a petty thief, who occa-
sionally ‘‘substitutes’” for the
warlord in dangerous situa-
tions. When this leader dies, the
double ‘‘becomes”’ the warlord
ei order to protect and unify the
clan.

463-9152

 

According to Dick Grefe,
faculty adviser of the W&L
Film Society, Kurosawa ‘“‘has
taken great pains to recreate
the costumes, settings and even
the weapons of a violent and
turbulent time in Japanese
history. Nevertheless, Kuro-
sawa did not photograph colors,
and sweeping motions create
enhanced images of epic pro-
portion.”’

Glover
paintings
on display

An exhibition of paintings by
Roanoke artist Ann Glover is on
display in Washington and Lee
University’s duPont Gallery
through Feb. 24.

A Roanoke native and a
graduate of Mary Baldwin Col-
lege, Mrs. Glover has taught
painting at the Roanoke
Museum of Fine Arts and
Virginia Western Community
College. She has served as one
of the Virginia Museum’s
traveling artist program in-
structors.

Works by Glover are contain-
ed in several permanent collec-
tions, including the Roanoke
Museum of Fine Arts. She has
had one-woman exhibitions at
the Roanoke Museum of Fine
Arts, the Lynchburg Art
League, Mary Baldwin College

and the Dorsey Gallery in
Roanoke.

duPont Gallery is open from 9
a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through
Friday, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Satur-
day, and 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. Sun-
day. Admission is free.

Depressed?
Mood may affect how you Study |

By COLE DAWSON
Staff Reporter

Mood affects memory. A re
cent study concluded by psy-
chology professor David G.
Elmes found that the efficiency
with which students remember
is directly correlated with their
mood and study environment.

Studying over a_ gradual
length of time proved to be
almost three times as effective
in learning and retaining most
material than last-minute
cramming. This analysis was
true for people in an ordinary or
content mood, but the dif-
ference was remarkably
smaller for those students who
were depressed.

The study found last-minute
cramming to be only one-third
less effective than spreading
out one’s study time for
depressed students. Depression
reduced the effectiveness of
more efficient learning situa-
tions.

In fact, according to Elmes,
depressed students had better
recall after cramming than did
the non-depressed students
after cramming.

“It may be that ‘optimal

learning situations may have to
be tailored to the emotional
characteristics of the in-
dividual,’’ Elmes said. Some

students may find it more effi-
cient to cram than to spread out
their work depending on their
mood, the study found.

The Elmes study involved in-
ducing a ‘‘mild depression’”’ by
letting a student ‘‘read through
a long series of self-referent
statements that were very
depressing in  connotation.”’
These included such statements
as, ‘‘all of the unhappiness of
my past life is catching up with
me,” and “I feel so depressed
today, I could go to sleep and
never wake up.”

The students were to think
about the statements and im-
agine they were indeed in those
situations. They were given
miniature personality tests to
ensure that they had reached a
depressive state.

The non-depressed control
group read through statements
that were not emotionally
charging and then given similar
personality tests.

“The particular mood you are
in, determines what you re-

member,’ according to Dr.
Elmes. He concluded that there
is a “‘state-dependent memory
based on mood.’’ That is, “‘if
students themselves are unhap-
py or depressed, then they may
indeed learn better under un-
pleasant studying situations,
like high pressure, than if they
are in a happy or ordinary
mood.”’

At this point it is ‘‘not at all
clear how an emotion, like
depression, influences the
memory directly.” Dr. Elmes
hopes that through his research
he will gain a better under-
standing of how ‘emotions in
general and depression in par-
ticular’ influence what aid how
people remember.

Dr. Elmes has two goals in his
research on mood and the
memory. One is trying to
understand how the memory
system itself works, and he also
is trying to “perhaps define effi-
cient learning situations.”

Elmes has been studying
memory in general since gradu-
ate school; but since 1920 has
been particularly interested in
the conditions that lead to effi-
cient memorizing.

To the Editors:

It is time to reply to pomposi-
ty with: logic. After reading
Markham S§. Pyle’s article in
the Jan. 19 issue of the Phi, I felt
compelled to write you. It is in-
teresting to note that the forces
of single-sex education always
someway bind themselves with
the tradition of Robert E. Lee.
Our ancestors did it this way so

why should not we?

Mr. Pyle defends Washington
and Lee, one of the Best Liberal
Arts Colleges in the nation, with
close minded, sneeringly sar-
castic remarks. Will the admis-
sion of women make us all card-
carrying communist members?
A new San Francisco or Green-

ODK lacks publicity

To the Editors:

I agree that it is unfortunate
that few students attended the
O.D.K.-Founders’ Day cere-
mony on Jan. 20. However, I
would not place the blame sole-
ly on student apathy.

In the past announcements
have been made by. teachers
concerning the important event
and the corresponding schedule
changes. This year, out of the
five classes I attended before
the event, not one of my
teachers made mention of the
situation. On campus there
were only one or two signs an-
nouncing the event, and the Phi

was only able to announce it the
week before, undoubtedly caus-
ing many students to simply
forget.

Last year’s ceremony pro-
duced an extremely large atten-
dance due to the fact that it was
the student’s first official con-
tact with our new president. I
doubt this incentive will be a
common occurrence, therefore,
I suggest more promotion by
the ODK Society, administra-
tion and faculty, and less
criticism of the students.

will not. I suggest Mr. Pyle
return to Goshen and get in
touch with his senses.

The spirit of this institution is
found not in the superflous, self-
serving remarks of Mr. Pyle,
but in Lee himself. Robert E.
Lee was an innovator as an
educator. Lee’s proscription for
this college was a demarcation
line in American educational
history. He started one of the
first elective systems in this
country. This was a departure
from the “Classics steeped
prewar education of Southern
gentlemen, all of whom were
expected to take exactly the
same courses in college no mat-
ter what they planned to do in
life.’’ Lee encouraged his facul-
ty to experiment and suggest
new ideas. Lee knew that as a
sanctuary for future Hope,
Washington College had to
change its course to be adept in
the new postwar era.

The charge that the admis-
sion will indirectly drive the
honor code underground and
that the role of student govern-
ment would take place in
revolutionary modes is absurd.
Lee said that ‘‘experience has
shown it (the Honor Code) can
be safely trusted — upon the
honour and self-respect of the
students themselves.” Will the
admission of women corrupt
this spirit which existed then
and today? Mr. Pyle implies
that it will and that is an insult
to every student on this cam-
pus. /

The Ring-tum Phi, February 2, 1984, Page 9

Lee would want it that way, Mr. Pyle

The students of VMI and
Washington College used to
march in a procession, to the
beat of a military drum. ‘Lee
made a point of marching out of
step.”’ he knew that a kindling
of past spirit could not benefit
the future of the South or the
Union. Lee knew that the battle
had ended. His energies were
expended to ensure that an
education through exposure
would enable men to have the
composure to see through
arguments that are as baldly

Slanted and irrational as Mr.
Pyle.

General Lee was a visionary.
He knew that the ability to
change, no matter how bitter
the metamorphosis, was a
necessity in a man’s character.
As President Reagan recently
told us, there are more women
entering executive positions
than ever before. It is no longer
a man’s world. It is time that we
adhere to Lee’s idea of change
and follow his off-beat March.

I think not. Since the eigh-
teenth century our graduates
have been producing records
which stand by themselves
while living lives consistent
with the high ideals enumerated
by our founders and shapers.
Until fairly lately there has
been little perceived need to
make the school a Harvard or a
Yale. Many men have chosen
the school over others such as
those for its unique qualities,
which are beyond comparison.

It seems then, and I suggest,
that this school might benefit
most by urgently striving
toward a new awareness of its
most historically pervasive and

appropriate tradition — un-

spoken, innate self-confidence.
This school has many strengths
which may be best presented in
a manner consistent with our
highest ideal. The gentleman of
Mark Twain, ‘‘conceals how
much he thinks of himself and
how little he thinks of other peo-
ple.’’ Whether specific
measures such as_ requiring

must be considered in this con-

Swimmers maintain national
ranking; four place in top 10

By DAVID NAVE

The Washington and Lee
swimming team defeated
William and Mary 66-47 last
weekend in a dual meet at the
Cy Twombly Pool. The victory
improved the Generals’ dual
meet record to 6-3 and helped
them retain their fifth-place na-
tional ranking in NCAA Divi-
sion III.

Taber Smith swam a personal
best on his split as the anchor-
man of the 400-yard medley
relay, and Tim Rock and Bobhy
Pearson placed first and secon
in the 1000-yard freestyle to help
give the Generals a 15-1 lead
after the first two events.

“It was an uphill fight for
William and Mary the rest of
the way,”’ said head swim coach
Page Remillard. The Generals
clinched the meet in the next to
last event.

According to Remillard, W&L
diver Joe Donovan dove very
well, despite losing his contacts.
Donovan won third place on the
one meter board and second
place on the three meter.

Currently the W&L swim
team is preparing for a dual
meet against Virginia Com-
monwealth on Feb. 10. The
meet will be held at Sweetbriar
College.

In preparation for the meet
against VCU, the Generals are
beginning to reduce the work
load during practices. Remil-
lard believes that the lighter
work-outs will allow the swim-
mers to rest. Also, the Generals
are going to spend more time
working on starts, turns and
race pace.

“VCU is a very, very good
team,” Remillard said. ‘‘A win.
would be the biggest of the year.
It could happen. VCU would
have to make a mistake, but I

final two months of the season,
here are a few thoughts on
everything from the Final Four
to drugs in Maryland. First,
there’s the Heels of UNC.
Frankly, a week ago, I would
have reserved the tournament
championship to the gang from
Chapel Hill. But now that Kenny
Smith (Phil Ford with
Skywalker capabilities) is out
for an indefinite period with a
broken wrist, the outlook may
have been changed. The Heels
are still the team to beat, but
when the game gets close,
Smith’s ability to see Michael
Jordan and his quickness on the
fast break will be missed. They
can get close to the champion-
ship without him (Jordan, Sam
Perkins et. als. are a little
familiar with winning and
aren’t ready to give it up) but

the explosiveness of a UNLV,
the menacing defense of a
Georgetown or the all-court
strength of a DePaul become a
greater threat should any of
these squads meet UNC minus
No. 30. Speakng of threats to the
crown, those three teams along
with the Carolina crowd are my
mid-season guesses as guests in
Seattle come the last weekend
in March. One warning though:
Watch out for those with three
or four losses right now (Mem-

be surprises, and these teams
will be doing the surprising.
And finally, it saddens, rather
sickens, me to listen to the story
out of College Park, Md., this
week. Adrian Branch was ar-

Coach Lefty Driesell said he
knew nothing of Branch’s drug

quickly suspended Mr. Branch
and his accomplice bench

“I am concerned with the per-

dividuals.’”’ Gee, Lefty, your
prepared statement sounds
great. But if you were really
concerned, coach, wouldn’t you
have been able to avoid having
this happen. Maybe Lefty
should think about what the

Hoopsters split,

face E&2H tonight

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
basketball team this week easi-
ly defeated Maryville on Mon-
day night, 75-62, but lost Thurs-
day night, 70-67, to a Catholic
team that W&L had already
beaten earlier in the season.

The win against Maryville in
Warner Center gave the team
an 11-7 record, 6-3in the ODAC. '

The Generals took the early
lead against the Scots and never
let up. W&L went on a 15-5
streak to end the half, leading
30-23. The Generals coasted to
the victory in the second half.

W&L outrebounded the Scots
40-32 and outshot them 48 per-
cent to 40 percent for the game.

The team welcomed the re-

Graves scored a game-high 22
points to pull within 10 points of
the number nine spot in career
basketball scoring. Junior for-
ward Scott Shannon added 14
points and a game-high 12 re-
bounds.

In Washington, D.C., Thurs-
day night the Generals lost toa
Catholic team that they had
beaten here earlier in the
season, 86-70.

Head coach Verne Canfield

expected a tougher game this”

time because of the four-hour
drive to get to Catholic Univer-
sity. Also, the Cardinals had the
services of 6-foot-8 sophomore
Bill.Clare, who missed the first
game between the two teams.

Canfield’s worries were well-
founded. The Generals had to
fight back from a 12-point
deficit to tie the game on a

Dixon paces WEL
grapplers to 9-2

By WILLIAM KING and
MIKE STACHURA
Staff Reporters

The Washington and Lee
wrestling team won two of its
three matches on the week, in-
cluding a 33-18 favorable deci-
sion last night against Long-
wood College to raise their
season tally to 9-2.

Last night, the Generals fell
behind the Lancers, 18-9, after
the first six bouts. But three
forfeits and a pin from Joe
O’Neill at 177 lbs. secured the
team victory for W&L. Other
winners on the evening for the
Generals were Jeff Mazza who
registered a fall at 126 lbs.,
Larry Anker (142 (142 lbs.),
Tim Valliere (167 lbs.) and
Carlton Peebles (HWT).

Pacing the Generals on the
season has been junior tri-
captain Jeff Dixon at 190 lbs.
With yesterday’s victory Dix-
on’s season mark stands at a

spotless 17-0.

Dixon is not the only General
with an impresseve record.
Valliere sports a 14-2 slate,
while Anker is 12-5 and Mazza is
11-6.

At the Washington and Jeffer-
son tri-meet, the Generals
defeated the host team 22-21,
thanks to Peebles’ 8-1 decision
at heavyweight. They lost to
Hiram College in their second
meet of the day, 38-12.

Head coach Gary Franke was
pleased with his team’s perfor-
mance in its two meets on the
week,

‘We wrestled very well in the
two wins,” Franke said. ‘‘And
despite the score, I felt that if
we could have wrestled a little
more aggressively, we could

have beaten Hiram.”

Saturday, the Generals play
host to Lynchburg, Furman and
LaSalle for the W&L Quad-
rangular meet, which begins at
1:30p.m.

Pavilion

 

(continued from page 1)

Tuesday’s meeting.

‘“‘He would not oppose a
building that -has some
usefulness to the athletic
needs,”’ though, Parsons added.

When not being used for
social functions, the bigger
pavilions would provide room
for athletic practices and in-
tramural events.

On Jan. 9, the EC approved a
maximum expenditure of $25
per student for 15 years. At that
time, the projected pavilion
cost was $250,000. Detailed
plans were drawn up by the
Richmond architectural firm of
Marcellus, Wright, Cox and
Smith showed an increase over
that estimate by a local firm.

Those plans were presented
to the EC Monday night, when
junior representative Darby
Brower told the EC that the
University would pay the in-
terest on a $400,000 loan.

After a lengthy debate on
whether to spend $400,000 for
the pavilion, the EC delayed ac-
tion until Tuesday.

‘“‘There’s just no way in the
world we can decide right now,
in this meeting, to spend this
money,” EC President Bob
Jenevein said.

SAB co-chairman Burford
Smith opened Tuesday’s
meeting by reporting that the
students would, indeed, be
responsible for both the prin-
cipal amount of the loan and the
interest. Dean of Students
Lewis John, Associate Dean of
Students Michael Cappetto and
Parsons were at the meeting to
answer questions.

Parsons said $25 per student
per year for 25 years, based on
1,700 students, would finance a
loan of $405,365.71.

“Do you want the place?
That’s what you have to ask
yourself,’’ Cappetto said. “Is
the pavilion worth it to you?”

Senior representative George
Youmans answered the ques-
tion. ‘‘This building’s supposed
to last 50 years,”’ he said. ‘‘It’s
going to affect everybody.”

Secretary Len Howard said,
“T’m still very much in favor of
building this facility. We’re go-
ing to need a facility like this.

‘“‘We’re not charging more to
the students as individuals,”
added Howard, noting that all
the EC had to do was extend the
$25 student tax increase from 15
years to 25 years to cover the
loan.

Jenevein suggested that
perhaps the EC should first find
out if the Board of Trustees
would approve such a project
and how much money the board
would be willing to contribute.
Then, Jenevein said, the EC can
make its decision.

Dean John said the student
body was doing the right thing,
though, by presenting the
trustees with a financial com-
mittment.

“There isn’t a whole lot of
money to be found at the mo-
ment,’ Parsons warned. ‘‘The
trustees will be considering re-
quests with a number of other
requirements that are coming
due.

“The university is interested
(in the pavilion),’’ Parsons add-

ed. ‘It will bring great relief
because of the problems we
have getting things set up in the
dinihg hall or in the gym (for a
social event).”

Brower’s motion to increase
the student tax by $25 (to $100
for 1984-85) for a 25-year period
was seconded by Youmans and
approved unanimously.

Before the vote, Cappetto
said, ‘Your sons and daughters
will be seniors here when you’re
paying for it.”

The smaller pavilion would be
about 72 feet wide and 103 feet

long for a total floor space of
7,400 feet. Fire regulations re-
quire at least seven feet of floor
space for each occupant. For
purposes of comparison, Evans
Dining Hall has a floor space of
about 6,300 square feet.

The larger pavilion would be
about 78 feet by 123 feet for a
total floor space of 9,600 feet.
Both pavilions would have a 3-
foot-high stage 24 feet deep.

Both also would have bath-
rooms, dressing rooms, a bar,
an office and storage area. The
larger pavilion would have ad-
ditional storage space.

In making his motion to raise
the student tax $25, Brower
noted that the tax had once been
2 percent of tuition but in recent
years had dropped to about 1
percent of tuition. Even the $100
tax, he said, would only be
about 1.5 percent of the tuition.

In a related matter, the EC
voted Monday to name the
pavilion after former W&L
president and law professor
Robert E.R. Huntley, who left
Jan, 1 to become executive vice-
president for Best Products,
Inc., in Richmond.

 

Trustees

undergraduate schools...

“We are...determined to do
everything we can to keep the
alumni, faculty and students of
the University informed about
our progress and in appropriate
ways, involved in our assess-
ments.

“We will discuss at our
February meeting how we
might best ensure this result.”’

President Wilson said he ex-
pects the session to be divided
into two parts.

The first, with staff present,
will be a general discussion of
the issue and how the Board ex-
pects to proceed.

“The Board concluded in Oc-
tober that the matter warranted
further study, but it didn’t
decide how that study would be
undertaken,’’ Wilson said.
‘“That’s what will be done at
this meeting.”

That will be followed by an
executive session of the
trustees, during which Wilson

said “the Board will be talking
quietly among itself, deciding

_ what’s at stake and what they

regard as the most important
issue.”’

Wilson said that the Board
will use its standing committee
structure to investigate ‘‘this
question of improving Washing-
ton and Lee and the question of
coeducation.

' “The Board could decide that
this does not have merit, and
that we should continue in our
current character,’’ he added. -

In addition to the trustees, the
executive session will include
Alumni Board of Directors
President Peter A. Agelasto III
and Student Body President
Robert C. Jenevein.

Wilson said they will attend
‘because they are by formal
agreement non-voting partici-
pants in Board activities.

“Though they are not formal
members of the Board and don’t
vote,”” he continued, ‘‘they can
and do have a voice. In this
case, it was thought valuable to
have them present from the
beginning.”’

‘‘As it was originally planned
by the Board, we were not in-

- vited to be in that session until I

brought it to President Wilson’s
attention,’’ Jenevein said.

‘“T firmly expressed my
desire and I think other people’s
desire to have students repre-
sented the whole time. I said in
no uncertain terms that I
thought that was the right thing
to do.”’

‘‘T hope they’ ll decide to settle
the issue before the end of this
school year,” Jenevein said.

A combined meeting of the
Budget and Audit and Invest-
ment committees will consider,
among other issues, tuition and
financial aid for the 1984-85
academic year.

University Treasurer E.
Stewart Epley said he will
recommend a substantial in-
crease over this year’s tuition of

He said that in their planning,
they are projecting inflation at5
percent, and the proposed in-
crease is well above that figure.

At Tuesday’s Executive Com-
mittee meeting, junior repre-
sentative Darby Brower, dis-
cussing a student tax increase
to finance the proposed
pavilion, said a $100 student tax
would be 1.5-percent of the pro-
posed 1984-85 tuition. $100 is 1.5
percent of $6,666.67.

‘One of the biggest factors in
that increase is that President
Wilson is concerned with the
level of faculty salaries,’’ Epley
said.

‘‘We try to stay competitive,”
Wilson added, and he said that
consideration would dictate a
higher level of compensation
next year.

Another reason for the in-
crease, Epley said, is inflation
and the increased cost of sup-
plies and equipment, particu-
larly energy.

Also, Epley said, “Dr. Wilson
wants to provide every year a
capital reserve provision’
which would likely be ‘‘in the
low six figures.”’

Possible uses of that would in-
clude purchase of a needed
$250,000 cooler, and replace-
ment of the Harris academic
computer in the 1985-86 school
year.

In addition, Epley said, there
will be a net increase in the
number of faculty next year.
This will include a Computer
Science department head and,
Wilson said, another chair in
the Romance Languages.

Epley said that funded finan-

cial aid for 1984-85 will ‘‘go up,

largely triggered by the in-
crease in tuition.”

Wilson said that the
Academic Affairs committee
will consider, among other
agenda items, the appointment
of a specialist in Judaic Studies
to a newly endowed chair in the
religion department.

VMI G WGL: A quiet rivalry

Relationship spans riots
in 20s to parties in 80s

By B. SCOTT TILLEY
Staff Reporter

Legends abound of the abuse
heaped on Virginia Military In-
stitute cadets by Washington
and Lee students, and vice-
versa. And, according to retired
W&L professor Dr. Charles
Turner, most probably are true.

“When I started teaching
here (1946) things were some-
what antagonistic between the
student bodies,’’ remembered
Turner.

‘‘In sports events and such, I
remember them ending up in
fights, sometimes. And I can
remember when the cadets
used to march to church on Sun-
days. The frats use to mock
them, trying to get them out of
step.”’

Turner also remembers “‘Vee
Mees, as we call them,’’ sneak-
ing over to “‘borrow”’ flags from
Lee Chapel, and W&L students
doing the same in Jackson Hall.

“They were even antagonistic
in church,” he recalled. ‘‘In the
baptist church, we had a special
place, the balcony, reserved for
them. When the church used to
vote on something, even on
something like new members,
they would all vote no, in a
block. But we just used to laugh,
because their vote didn’t count

much anyway.”

Relations between the two
schools had a much more
auspicious start, though. In
fact, VMI was originally a com-
ponent of Washington College.

According to Ollinger Cren-
shaw’s ‘‘General Lee’s Col-
lege,” in 1836 the Virginia
legislature passed a_ bill
“reorganizing the Lexington
arsenal and establishing a
Military school in connection
with Washington College.”’

In 1838, the Virginia Military
Institute was officially orga-
nized. The Washington College
Board of Trustees used money
in its Cincinnati fund to appoint
the Cincinnati Professor of the
College. They elected Colonel
Francis H. Smith, who also
became commandant.

Before the two schools would
formally separate, the Wash-
ington College trustees would
consider, and defeat, a proposal
to combine the two schools into
“The Washington Institute of
Virginia.” When the formal
separation occurred, Dr.
George Armstrong, professor of
chemistry, wrote the Rock-
bridge County delegate to the
General Assembly that VMI’s
independence would ‘‘convert it

_into a College which shall be a

rival of Washington College, of

 

   

 

 

a

 

  

such a character that the
rivalry, between them must
eventually result in the
downfall of one of them or the
other.”’

By the time of the Civil War,
antagonism had clearly begun.

 

Three times (before the battle
of New Market) the cadets were
called into service. And three
times, after seeing no action
and not firing a shot, they
returned to Lexington amidst
the mocking and jibes of
Washington College students.

By the turn of the century,
rocky relations also had
become prevalent on _ the
athletic fields.

“One time, years and years
ago, students broke out in a riot
between the two schools at an
athletic event,’ said W&L
athletic director William
McHenry. ‘That was back
when the rivalry was intense.”’

After that incident, athletic
competition between the two
virtually ceased, said
McHenry. Even in the early
1950s, when McHenry was a stu-
dent here, the wisdom of
athletic competition still was
questionable. The two teams
relented to scrimmage, but it
was closed to student spec-
tators.

Competition in all sports ex-
cept those subsidized by
scholarships at VMI — football,
basketball, and track — was not
resumed until 1971. ‘‘Even when
we were subsidized in athletics,
when we were usually much
stronger, we still didn’t play
them,” said McHenry.

Dr. Turner noted that interac-
tion used to be prevalent among
the schools in the academic
spectrum. He was one of many
professors that used to be in-
volved in a professor exchange
program between the two col-
leges.

But even that is minimal to-
day, according to Dean of
Students Lewis John.

 

“It is too bad there isn’t
(more academic interaction),
but our different natures
preclude a lot of it,’’ he ex-
plained.

Different academic calendars
and daily schedules have
limited the number of pro-
grams, such as a student taking
classes at the other school, said
John. ‘‘It’s not impossible, but it
is difficult. There are a lot of
barriers,” he said.

The major source of aca-
demic cooperation, he added,
has been the cross-referencing
of the card catalogues at the
libraries of each school.

But the degree. of segregation
between the two schools was
made particularly clear to VMI
Chaplain Charles Caudill last
year during a tragic time at
VMI. Three cadets, as well as a
Randolph-Macon Woman’s Col-
lege student, were killed in an
automobile accident on U.S. 11,
just north of Lexington. Not a
single W&L student attended
the memorial service at VMI.

‘“‘W&L and VMI are so close,
we need to get to know each
other more,”’ Chaplain Caudill
said at the time while summing
up the history of the two
schools. The only growth he
said he has seen between the
two schools is their Christian
communities. é

“If two students, one from
VMI and one from W&L, had
been in the car, I don’t know if
there would have been a joint
service,’ he concluded. ‘‘It
would be interesting to see what
would happen. I don’t know.”’

Exactly how is life across the
way? Ask any number of VMI
cadets and one will get any
number of answers: these,
unrealistic, disciplined were a
few of the adjectives used to
describe life at our brother
campus.

If a man from W&L were ask-
ed to trade places with a cadet
for a week and then describe the
experience, ‘“‘harsh’’ probably
would be the predominant ad-
jective used.

The legend of New Market

By B. SCOTT TILLEY
Staff Reporter

On May 15, 1864, 247 cadets
charged into battle at New
Market, and thus changed the
history of the Virginia Military
Institute. The annual recogni-
tion of that event is still the
most revered celebration at
VMI.

The Battle of New Market
was the climactic point of Union
General Franz Sigel’s Shenan-
doah Valley campaign of 1864.
General Ulysses S. Grant was
then battling General Robert E.
Lee at Spotsylvania in his quest
to take the Confederate capital
at Richmond, and he realized
the implications that a
simultaneous victory in the
Valley could have.

Not only was the Valley the
breadbasket of the South, but
Sigel could also capture the ma-
jor railroad transportation
centers of Staunton and Lynch-
burg. If victorious, he would on-
ly be 60 miles west of Lee’s left
flank at Spotsylvania. “I pro-
pose to fight it out on this line if
it takes all summer,” said
Grant.

The force charged with stop-
ping Sigel was led by Major-
General John C. Breckinridge,
the former vice-president and
1860 presidential candidate. As
he advanced toward the en-
counter from southwest Vir-
ginia, he found himself greatly
outmanned. The Augusta and
Rockingham County Reserves
had been called up, but that
number was still insufficient.
On May 2, General Francis H.
Smith, superintendent of VMI,
offered the services of the
cadets. On May 10,
Breckinridge called the cadets
into service.

That afternoon, they had par-
ticipated in a Lexington
ceremony commemorating the

death of Thomas ‘Stonewall’
Jackson, a former professor of
physics at VMI, a year earlier
at Chancellorsville, Va.

The cadets cheered as they
broke from ranks upon hearing
the news. They had grown de-
jected listening to reports of the
war and burying local dead
while never being called
themselves. On three occasions
the cadets had been summoned
to oppose the Union raids of
Brigadier-General William
Averell, but each time failed to
find him or fire a shot, return-
ing to the jibes of Lexington
residents. In March, they had
even called themselves _ to-
gether into a mass meeting and
passed a resolution offering
their services to Lee.

The youthful cadet corps was
led by Colonel Scott Shipp, only
24 himself. The veterans teased
the cadets, calling them the
‘‘Seedcorn Battalion.’”’ A
regimental band struck up the
tune ‘“‘Rockabye Baby”’ and the
veterans cradled their rifles in
their arms and sang along.

The confrontation between
Union and Confederate troops
occured May 15 at New Market.
Breckinridge hoped to keep the
cadets in reserve, vowing only
to use them if necessary.

As the battle reached its
peak, the Confederate center
was on the verge of collapse.
Major Charles Semple told
Breckinridge that the cadets
were the only hope, but he
allegedly responded, ‘‘No
Charley, this will not do, they
are only children and I cannot
expose them to such fire as our
center will receive.”

Semple tried to contract the
lines, but soon returned saying
that it was impossible. Breckin-
ridge, with a tear in his eye,
said, ‘‘Put the boys in...and God
forgive me for the order.’’ It is

said that he turned his back as
the cadets charged into battle.

Suddenly, Sigel attempted a
charge with the 34th Massachu-
setts leading the way. The
cadets repulsed them, though,
and Captain Henry A. Wise,
who replaced the injured Shipp,
jumped up and_ =yelled
“Charge!”

The cadets moved forward
like a human avalanche. As
they rushed forward, the
ground, like a swamp from the
rain, literally sucked the shoes
from their feet. ‘‘The Field of
Lost Shoes’’ did not stop them;
and the left and right flanks
rallied around. Soon Sigel’s
whole line was under attack,
retreating, Sigel screaming
orders in German. Unfortunate-
ly, none of his men spoke Ger-
man.

Triumphantly, Oliver
“Brave” Evans waved the flag
of VMI from the top of a cap-
tured caisson from Captain
Albert Von Kleiser’s battery.
Future U.S. Senator Charles
Faulkner took 23 prisoners
himself.

The victory was a costly one:
47 cadets were wounded. Ten
were dead. The cadets quickly
became romantic heroes. Lee
thanked them for protecting his
flank, Breckinridge praised
their courageous actions. Presi-
dent Jefferson Davis addressed
them in Richmond, “Stone-
wall’ Jackson’s old brigade
paid tribute to them, the Con-
federate Congress commended
them and thousands cheered
them. Breckinridge, later ap-
pointed Confederate Secretary
of War, would always refer to
them as ‘‘my cadets.’’

On that day, they had saved
Staunton, protected Lee’s left
flank while he fought at Spot-
sylvania, created a legend and
made a name for the Virginia
Military Institute.

 

Controversy rases
over Rat line

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

On the Chinese calendar,
“The Year of the Rat’’ (year
4682), began Sunday, but you
won’t find anyone celebrating
over at the Virginia Military In-
stitute.

That’s because the freshmen
have become the focus of a bit-
ter conflict between the In-
stitute’s administration and the
upper classes.

“Things are getting pretty
slack around here,’’ a cadet in
the guardroom said Tuesday of
the treatment this year’s Rats
are receiving as a result of ad-
ministration policy.

The Institute is run by the
Superintendent, General Sam S.
Walker, and the Commandant
of Cadets, Col. Harold B.
Snyder Jr.

The head of student govern-
ment is the First Class Presi-
dent, Jamie Edward Clark, an
English major from Sharps-
ville, Penn., who will be in the
Marine Corps.

From the beginning of the
year, there were reports of
“friction’”’ and “‘lack of com-
munication’ between the two
sides.

said at the time that the ‘“‘whole
issue stems from the fact...that
the Administration is bending
over backwards to keep Rats
from leaving.”

The official count at integra-
tion time showed that 43 Rats
had left, but the Cadet said that
the actual figure was somewhat
higher.

The newspaper said that for
each Rat that had left at that
point in the year, the Institute
lost about $8,000 in reim-
bursements to the parents and
loss in state support. Clark said
he was concerned that when the
system gets easier, the ‘‘quality
of the product drops.”’

The First Class acquiesced to
integration reluctantly. ‘They
have listened to me, and
understand we don’t have a
choice, fight or not,”’ Clark said.

An editorial in the Cadet the
following week said the effect of
administration policy was ‘‘to
ram rat integration, in both
ranks and the mess hall, down
the Corps’ throat. Little, if any,
consideration was given to the
First Class,’ which normally
runs the Rat line.

 

‘The whole issue stems from the

fact. .. that the Administration is

bending over backwards

to keep Rats from leaving.’

 

In an interview in eariy Oc-
tober with The V.M.I. Cadet,
the student newspaper, Clark
took a conciliatory tone, saying
that ‘“‘a portion of it was our
fault.”

However, he pointed out the
conflict he faced in having to
follow orders from the admin-
istration as well as trying to ac-
commodate the many wishes of
the cadets.

On Oct. 24, the dispute
escalated when the separate
Rat ranks were dissolved and
the freshmen were ‘‘integrated
into the Old Corps.” In recent
times, this has taken place
much later in the year, after
“breakout,”” when the Rats
achieve fourth class status.

Several nights earlier, the
First Class had voted ‘‘over-
whelmingly’’ against pre-
breakout integration. Accord-
ing to an account in the Cadet,
at Supper Roll the Thursday
night before, by ‘‘throwing his
Regimental Executive Officer’s

collar brass to the floor, Clark .

dramatically proved his sin-
cerity in carrying out the
desires of the class.”’
Integration took place as
scheduled, however, and Clark

On Oct. 28, Clark met with the
VMI Board of Visitors, and
received a vote of no con-
fidence.

The next week, he outlined for
the First Class the options
available to it, including “step-
ping off.”

“The Bullet,”’ known as “The
Rat Bible,” defines a ‘‘step off”’
as “‘the ultimate act of protest
by the Corps of Cadets in de-
fiance of an unfavorable ad-
ministrative policy.”

At the meeting with the First
Class, Clark pointed out that ‘‘a
step off could result in a
dismissal of some members of
the class.”’

In two separate votes that
night, approximately half the
class expressed its approval of
integration, so further protests
were not pursued.

Last week, the administration
(known to Cadets as ‘‘Smith
Hall’’) stated that in the future,
the First Class would no longer
be permitted to work out the
Rats in any manner.

In addition, the Rat Dis-
ciplinary Committee is now per-
mitted to meet only once a week
for half an hour.

First Class reaction has not
yet been determined.

Alumni help cadets

with placement

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

Virginia Military Institute
alumni play an important role
in assisting cadets find job op-
portunities, Lt. Col. Royce E.
Jones, director of cadet affairs
and placement, said in an inter-
view last week.

About 300 VMI alumni assist
the placement office in helping
caydets find jobs, Jones said.
Alumni not only alert cadets to
possible job openings, but also
do such things as house cadets
who are in a city for a job inter-
view and lecture on aspects of
finding a job, Jones said.

Alumni inform the placement
office of job openings in their

A cadet can specify his
employment interest and even a
geographical preference to the
computer, and receive a print-
out of alumni matching the
specifications who might have
information on job openings,
Jones said.

“Everyone uses something
that fits their situation. A lot of
people are using computers.
The computer just makes it
easier to organize,’’ Jones said.

On occasion, the placement
office also will send out the
resumes of cadets to companies
that request information on
future graduates in certain
fields, Jones said. Unless the
company specifically requests
resumes for certain individuals,

‘ That kind of contact is like having

many sets of eyes instead of just one’

 

own companies and companies
they do business with, Jones
said. The pool of VMI alumni is
too small to provide enough job
openings for graduating cadets
in their own companies alone,
Jones explained.

“That kind of contact is like
having many sets of eyes in-
stead of just one guy,’’ Jones
said.

Jones describes the place-
ment office’s role as being that
of a ‘“‘middle-man’”’ who finds
out about jobs and informs like-
ly candidates of the openings.
The placement office might
suggest that the two parties get
together, but after that it is up
to the cadet, said Jones.

“We purposely don’t want
them to think that we get them
jobs. The responsibility of get-
ting the job is with the cadet,”
Jones emphasized.

In order to spread informa-
tion about job openings and
possible job applicants, the
placement office utilizes
several sophisticated methods.

Jones said the placement of-
fice sends out a bulletin to both
alumni who have volunteered to
assist in placement and to
cadets who have registered
with the placement office. The
bulletin provides information
on both job openings and brief
summaries of the credentials of
cadets looking for jobs.

Starting this year, the place-
ment office also has begun to
use several computer programs
to cross reference cadets seek-
ing jobs with possible sources of
jobs, Jones said. A similar pro-
cedure had been used previous-
ly; however, the cross referenc-
ing had to be done by hand, he
said.

the placement office will send
the company the resumes of
every registered cadet in that
field, he added.

“One thing we don’t do is try
to judge who is a good engineer.
We don’t pick out individual
Students,’ Jones emphasized.

About 60 cadets register each
year with the placement office
to receive assistance in the job
search, Jones said. In addition,
30 alumni, many just coming off
active duty in the military, he
added, register with the place-
ment office.

Although Jones said that he
does not rely on statistics to
justify what the placement pro-
gram does, the px. . has
been fairly successful.

‘About a quarter or a third of
our guys Say they got their jobs
through the placement officer
in their department,” Jones
said.

Nonetheless, Jones said the
career planning part of the
placement office’s program is
probably as important as the
placement part. A great deal of
time is spent teaching cadets
how to go about getting a job
and helping them find a career
that appeals to them, Jones
said.

“The key to the whole career
planning and placement pro-
gram is that the students get in-
volved in it early. A guy has to
find out what a job is about,”’
Jones said.

Jones said that he expects
VMI’s placement program to be
upgraded next year because a
full time placement officer pro-
bably will be added. Jones said
he spends only about half his
time at VMI working on place-
ment duties.

 

 

Running: a daily chore for cadets

By PAUL CLARK
Staff Reporter

Did you ever wonder why
VMI cadets constantly are run-
ning across our campus?

According to Dr. Clark King,
chairman of the VMI physical
education department, running
is only a part of an extensive
and rigorous physical fitness
program required for all
cadets.

All freshmen, sophomores
and juniors are enrolled in a
physical education program,
Clark said. The P.E. cur-
riculum is divided into two
parts: classroom study and ac-
tivities. The classroom subjects
include CPR, drug and alcohol
abuse and films. Activities in-
ciude swimming, boxing,
weight training, wrestling and
scuba diving, among others,
King explained.

The freshman, or Rat, class

Front Lawn, February 2, 1984, Page 5

 

has a program that, according
to King, is designed like Out-
ward Bound — an intense exer-
cise program that brings out the
survival element in man. The
Rat program only lasts one
semester. When it is completed
the first-year cadets can then
join another program, such as
aerobics.

Keydets take the aerobics
class four days a week. Each
Keydet has to earn a minimum
of seven points a day. To
receive maximum credit for the
class, a Keydet must earn 40
points a week. Failure to earn
30 points in a week results in a
zero. Similar to the W&L
Physical Education depart-
ment, three zero marks means
the student fails the course
regardless of any additional ef-
fort he puts into it.

Rats at VMI are required to
complete a 1% mile run in 10

 

 

minutes, 30 seconds to receive
credit for the program. Points
can be earned in a variety of
ways, but the amount of points
earned is determined by the in-
tensity of the sport. For exam-
ple, two rats playing raquetball
will receive more points if they
play ata high level of intensity,
whereas if they play lackadais-
ically they will get fewer points,
King said.

According to Dr. King, ‘“‘We
give points based on a pulse of
150 — a 60 percent level for men
of their ages.’’ Some men, said
King, choose to earn all of their
points through running.

“It is all very complicated
and confusing to someone not
aware of or familiar with our
system,’’ adds King. ‘‘There is
one thing we can be assured of
— these men undergo strenuous
workouts — they are very chal-
lenging.

Cadets are upset over possible changes

By FRANK
KOLLMANSPERGER and
BILL JEMIS

OF THE
VMI CADET

While their neighbors, the
students of Washington and Lee
University have struggled with
the questions of coeducation
and necktie requirements, the
cadets at Virginia Military In-
stitute have loudly questioned
administrative directives con-
cerning the Ratline and Rat in-
tegration. Although conflict be-
tween the Corps and the ad-
ministration has become as
much a tradition as the Friday
afternoon parade, the changes
this year have been more startl-
ing and the responses more im-
passioned than in years past.

Brochures describing VMI to.

prospective cadets characterize
barracks life as an experiment
in self government and leader-
ship. The First Class has tradi-
tionally taken the leading role
in this experiment, through
cadet organizations such as the
Honor Court, the General and
Executive Committees and the
Rat Disciplinary Committee.
The Honor Court is composed of
fifteen elected members, five
from the Second Class and 10

social life. So do the cadets
become angry when they hear
parties roaring into the wee
hours while they remain con-
fined to the barracks?

“Yeah,”’ said one upper-
classman, ‘‘but you have to ac-
cept it or you’ll gocrazy.”’

At some point, many cadets
become a little bit tired of life at
the “I’’ and the result is a
phenomenon known as “run-
ning the block” — escaping
from the barracks, usually to an
illegal apartment party or a
W&L fraternity. If caught in the
act, a cadet may face a penalty
of several weeks in confine-
ment.

So what is a good cadet to do
with the petty rules and the
tight hours putting never-
ceasing pressure on him. For
many at the Institute, sports is
the only viable outlet.

As of last year, VMI was
dropped from Division I to Divi-
sion I-AA status by the NCAA.
This means that VMI is not
obligated to schedule all the big-
ger schools in the area. They do
manage to play a good deal of
Division I competition and in
many cases, especially in foot-
ball, they pay for it. A school of
1,500 students just cannot keep
up with a program that has
30,000 students to work with.

The cadets interviewed
seemed to believe that VMI was
heading toward Division III
status but was being pushed to
stay on a scholarhsip level by
the alumni.

 

from the First Class, and they
are directly responsible for ap-
plying the cadet honor — “A
cadet will not lie, cheat or steal,
nor tolerate those who do’’ — to
everyday situations, setting
policies concerning exams,
homework, and status, and en-
forcing those policies regard-
less of the offender’s rank,
positiion or popularity within
the Corps. Its authority is
seldom questioned, and the ad-
ministration is strongly suppor-
tive of the Court and its policies.

The same level of administra-
tion support has not been forth-
coming this year to the other-
three student governing bodies.
While the Executive and
General Committees, which are
composed of the three officers
of the upper three classes, are

responsible for enforcing a self-
imposed standard of conduct
and appearance of cadets in
public, the Rat Disciplinary
Committee (RDC) is concerned
solely with the enforcement of a
strict code of additional restric-
tions placed on the first-year
cadet (Rat.) This last commit-
tee has become the focal point
of conflict between the ad-
ministration and the First
Class.

This year General Sam
Walker, by direction of the VMI
Board of Visitors, has taken ac-
tion to remove perceived ex-
cesses and abuses of the Rat
system, most especially in the
area of physical conditioning
and disciplinary action. These
changes have attracted the
fierce opposition of the

Corps, who feel that the com-
mon hardships and physical
obstacles of the Rat year pro-
vide for a better cadet and a
strong unified class. Amid emo-
tional charges that Walker is at-
tempting to transform VMI into
a model of West Point, his alma
mater, the Corps has been
frustrated in every attempt to
seek redress; and many believe
that the only option left is a

“step off’’ — a demonstration in
which the entire Corps refuses
to attend classes, wear
uniforms, or march in parades.
Past “‘step offs” have been met
with stern reprisals to include
the dismissal of entire classes.
This year is no exception as
Gen. Walker has threatened to
dismiss those cadets who open-
ly defy his directives.

A Rat consumes his ‘square meal’ in the VMI dining hall.

Walker’s determined effort to
“clean up’’ the Ratline and gain
a tighter control of barracks
coupled with the fierce opposi-
tion of the Corps to include the
Rats themselves, only serve to
illustrate the emotional nature
of the issues at hand. VMI men,
whether they be Rats, upper-
classmen or alumni, all at-
tribute the unique nature of
VMI and its successorsuccess in
furthering the ideals on which it
is founded, to the system of in-
doctrination and training of new
cadets known as the Ratline.

Whatever the outcome of the
current power struggle between
Gen. Walker and the Corps may
be, this much is seems certain,
the Ratline, as it has existed in
recent years is an endangered
species destined to be modified
or replaced.

 

 

The mention of alumni raised
another major topic with most
of the cadets — the inordinate
amount of influence the alumni
have on the school. One cadet
called them ‘‘the silent voice;”’
most refer to them as ‘‘pains.”’
Perhaps this is because most of
the tactical officers — faculty
members who help police the
barracks — are VMI graduates
and the commandant (dean of
students), who is in charge of
discipline, is invariably a VMI
graduate.

Needless to say, the new
cadets don’t get much slack
from the old cadets now running
the show. The administration
says it’s all part of the VMI
tradition. The current students
call it pressure, pressure to
make the grade in a world that
is changing outside the parade
grounds of VMI, but remains
static, some say unforgiving, in-
side the institution.

In many cases, students
under the kind of pressure that
cadets insist is real would turn
to drugs for some kind of relief.
Most cadets are quick to admit
that there are drugs on the cam-
pus; heard of, but not seen.

In light of the fact that 11
cadets have been subpoenaed
by the recent grand jury in-
vestigating drug dealing in Lex-
ington, perhaps the problem is a
little worse than many are will-
ing to admit. When asked which
campus had a worse drug pfo-
blem between W&L and VMI,
the general response was that
they were probably about the
same, but that it was not a ma-
jor problem at VMI.

The big difference between
the schools, according to some
cadets, was the two school’s
honor systems. The cadets feel
that theirs is much stricter and,
therefore, taken more serious-
ly. In the same breath, they also

would say that it is unrealistic
because it is too all-encom-
passing and doesn’t give
students enough room for gen-
uine error.

Lying, cheating and stealing
are covered by W&L’s honor
code. VMI’s covers these areas
as well as nearly every other
aspect of daily life. The cadets
say their system works, but at
the expense of any hint of
casual flippancy. The sound of
percussion in the middle of the
night — a cadet being “drum-
med out’’ for an honor violation
—punctuates the respect with
which it is treated.

So, with all its gothic code of
honor, stringent system of dis-
cipline and regimine and the
Spartan way of life, from the ar-
chitecture of the buildings to the
starch-laden meals, is there
still a place in the American col-
lege scene for the kind of ex-
perience VMI has to offer?

The cadets answer with a re-
sounding yes. Why? Because
they fast are becoming the last
of a dying breed — an all-male
military institute. With the ser-
vice academies going coeduca-
tional and pointing toward a
more __ technically-orineted
education, the men at VMI feel
their school offers a superior
education. Some referred to it
as a “pure” military ex-
perience. Pure in a sense that
has been grounded in the values
given the academy by
Stonewall Jackson. There has
been little change since.

First classman A.W. Meade
caught the overriding sense of
pride the cadets have for their
school when asked whether he
thought tradition was the glue
that holds the institute together.

“No,” he replied. ‘It’s people
fighting to hold the tradition

 together.’’

AD, coach satisfied with Cameron Hall

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

An arena seating over 5,000
spectators would seem to be out
of place in small-town Lex-
ington. Not so if you ask Tom
Joynes or Marty Fletcher about
Cameron Hall, the imposing
athletics and convocations
structure on the campus of
Virginia Military Institute.

Joynes, athletic director at
VMI, was initially suspect of the
size of the $7 million facility,
saying in January 1983, “It’s
ridiculous to have a_ building
which seats 5,000 in a town
which only has 5,000 people in
Nig

In the interview last year, he
also said that the arena would
rarely be filled for sporting
events or other functions. He
felt it would be difficult to at-
tract popular bands, saying,
“The type of show that would
come wouldn’t clear enough to
pay for their advertising.”

The hall has been used for
VMI drama productions, ban-
quets, and other special events
like the Founder’s Day Con-
vocation at VMI and former
President Gerald Ford’s speech
in October.

However, it has not attracted
many concerts in its two-and-a-
half year existence. Pure
Prairie League played the hall
in April 1983, and the Fancy
Dress Thursday night concert
was held there in 1982 when the
Atlanta Rhythm Section played.

Joynes explained that
although there was no plan that
it would generate any revenue,
the Board of Visitors at VMI
(similar to W&L’s Board of
Trustees) thought Cameron
Hall would get more get more
business than it does.

Ike Sherlock, Director of
Cameron Hall, declined com-
ment on the issue.

Joynes’ attitude has changed
somewhat over time, however.
He still feels Cameron Hall has
too many seats for basketball
but recognizes its important
functions for the school and the
cadets. “It’s given us a great
place to play basketball and a
great place for graduation and
corps convocations.

‘‘There are too many seats for
basketball, but those extra
seats are used for corps con-
vocations,” Joynes said.

Joynes explained that
Cameron Hall is an improve-
ment as a site for corps con-
vocations and graduation
ceremonies because the
building formerly used, JM
Hall, wasn’t large enough to
seat the cadets, faculty and
guests.

“It was built for the special
needs. It has served its purpose
as a multi-purpose facility,” he
said.

According to Capt. 0.
Lawrence Burnett, Director of
Public Information at VMI,
“VMI had long felt the need for
a multi-purpose auditorium.
The facility was 10 years in the

ia

 

planning.”’

The primary tenant at
Cameron Hall has been head
basketball coach Marty Fletch-
er and his Keydets, who began
playing their home games there
in November 1981 with an open-
ing night contest against the
University of Virginia and
Ralph Sampson. Even then,
with the second best team and
number one player in the na-
tion, ‘“There were still 600 seats
open,”’ Joynes said.

Coach Fletcher, though, feels
it is an excellent facility for

basketball. ‘‘Spectator-wise, I
don’t think there’s a bad seat in
the house. We feel like the
crowd is able to be right there
with us,” the Keydets’ third-
year leader said. Fletcher also
praised the technical aspects of

' the gymnasium.

The hall is rarely more than
half full for a basketball game,
but Fletcher finds this to be no
hindrance to his team’s play.
‘‘We’ve had crowds of 700, 800
people, but the corps is so en-
thusiastic and they cheer so

well for us.

Cameron Hall is a change
from the Keydets’ former
home, affectionately known as
“The Pit,’ where the corps
played an instrumental role in
not only cheering for VMI
teams but also disturbing op-
posing squads.

Fletcher hopes to establish
the same type of atmosphere in
Cameron Hall. “It’s a bigger
place than The Pit. We’ll just
have to work a little harder, and
it seems like it’s starting to
move in that direction.”

VMI clings to Division I status

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

Virginia Military Institute is
one of the smallest schools com-
peting in Division I athletics,
and although major sports
there have had a few lean years
recently, the school’s inter-
collegiate athletic program has
produced success that belies the
school’s size.

The Keydet basketball team
has not posted a winning season
in five years, yet as few as eight
years ago VMI reached the final
eight of the NCAA tournament.

From the 1975-76 season
through the ’77-78 season, the
basketball team went 22-10, 26-4
and 21-7, respectively. In 1976
the team lost to Rutgers, 91-75,
in the Eastern Region finals of
the NCAA tournament. In 1977
the team lost to Kentucky in the
semifinals, 93-78.

The team’s last winning
season before 1975 came in 1941.

The Keydet football team,
which competes in Division
IAA, hasn’t produced the great
successes of the basketball

team, but it has been more con-

sistent. In 1981 the team was
6-3-1, winning against Virginia
Tech and Army. This year,
though, the team posted a 2-9
record.

In track and wrestling, less-
emphasized sports, VMI is
more successful. The track
team has won the state cham-
pionship three out of the last
five years, and the wrestling

successful __ intercollegiate
sports program is important to
VMI. “‘We want to win and we
want to be competitive, but we
haven’t been in the last five
years in our two major sports,”’
said Strickler.

However, there are no major
plans to improve the teams by a
radical change in the program,
and under no circumstances

VMI is going to do everything
possible to compete on a Divi-
sion I level in athletics and win
as many championships in the
state and Southern Conference
as possible,”’ said Strickler.

One of the reasons that a Divi-
sion I program is important to
VMI, he suggested, is the
athletic scholarships attract
athletes who would not normal-

‘VMI recruiting is a little bit tougher because

of the academic and military requirements’

 

team has won 30 consecutive
dual meets over the last three
years.

According to Sports Informa-
tion Director Mike Strickler, a

would VMI drop to a lower divi-
sion, according to Strickler.
“The Board of Visitors (com-
parable to W&L’s Board of
Trustees) set a policy not too
many years ago that states that

ly have become cadets.

“VMI recruiting is a little bit
tougher because of the aca-
demic and the military require-
ments,” he said. ‘‘The type of

recruit they’re looking for is the
kid who can handle the
toughness of the military
system here and still play ma-
jor college athletics and get a

good education.

“If there were no scholar-
ships, VMI would be _ hard-
pressed to get the number of
cadets they want in the bar-
racks,” said Strickler. ‘‘The ad-
missions office and the business
offices have said as much.”

According to Strickler, 159 out
of the 1,300 cadets in the school
are on some sort of athletic
scholarship, with a little over
half that number receiving full
scholarships.

Of that 159, about 145 scholar-
ships go to athletes in football,
basketball, track and wrestling.
The other sports for which
scholarships are awarded are
baseball, soccer, tennis, golf
and swimming.

Athletic scholarships are
funded by the Keydet Ciub,
which this year will raise
$700,000 from alumni for
scholarships.

EC president calls incident ‘honest oversight’

By RICK SWAGLER
Chief Editor

A case of jury tampering by
Student Body President Bob
Jenevein resulted in the strik-
ing of a juror prior to the public
honor hearing Monday.

Jenevein, who argued the Ex-
ecutive Committee’s case in the
trial along with Vice President
David Judge, spoke to the juror,
‘Scott John Fitzgerald, on Satur-
day.

Fitzgerald said that Jenevein
approached him and another
student, Emory Edwards, at
the Board of Trustees luncheon
Saturday.

Although specifics were not
discussed, honor in general was
discussed.

‘‘My intention was just to say
‘hi’ to some other students,”’
Jenevein said. ‘‘At the time it
never crossed my mind that it
would be questioned.”

Fitzgerald, a member of the
Class of 1984, said, ‘For my
part, I thought it was pretty
harmless.”

Jenevein, Fitzgerald and Ed-
wards all agree on the facts of
the incident, including that the
specifics of Monday’s trial were
not discussed.

Fitzgerald told Jenevein and
Edwards that a juror from a
previous public honor trial had
told him that the deliberations
had centered on the ethics of
‘‘booting’”’ someone rather than
on guilt or innocence.

‘“‘T wouldn’t have that pro-
blem. I could try a case on its
facts,’ Fitzgerald said he told
Jenevein.

According to Edwards, Jene-
vein mentioned the incident to
senior law representative Jim
Green because of the potential
effect on the outcome of the
hearing, in which the two de-
fendants were acquitted. Green
raised the question with Student
Bar Association President Kel-
ly Wrenn prior to the hearing to
ensure a fair trial, Edwards
said.

Fitzgerald was informed that

he had been struck from the
jury when he reported to the
trial Monday morning.

‘] think I could have tried the
case on its merits,’’ Fitzgerald
said. ‘I figured if there was a
policy of non-contact with the
jurors, Bob wouldn’t have sat
down — assuming he knew
about it.”’

Jenevein called the incident
an “honest oversight’” and ‘“‘un-

fortunate, given the waves it’s
caused.”

‘“Tt’s unfortunate when
something like this comes up,
but it reminds us to be careful
with the Honor System,’’ he
said.

Jenevein added that after
discussing the matter with
Wrenn, all parties agreed that
Fitzgerald could be struck from
the jury without jeopardizing
the fairness of the trial.

Trustees hike tuition,
endorse party pavilion

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
University Board of Trustees
decided last weekend to begin a
comprehensive study of the
coeducation question.

Board rector (chairman)
James M. Ballengee said that
the study would be ‘‘as thorough
and as systematic as possible.”’

In other action, the Board:

e Approved a tuition of $6515
for next year, up $715 from this
year;

¢ Endorsed the idea of a stu-
dent pavilion and the proposed
student tax to partially finance
it;

e Formed a Campus Life
Committee, which becomes the
seventh committee of the
Board.

Ballengee said that the for-
mation of such a committee has
been under consideration for
some time.

‘‘We didn’t have a committee
that focused on the residential
life of the University, and we
thought that would be valua-
ble,”’ he said.

The rector said the commit-
tee is responsible for Board
matters involving co-curricular
and extracurricular activities,
the dining hall, the fraternities
and ‘“‘all residential aspects of
Washington and Lee.’’

 

° Coed, page 4
* Pavilion, page 4
¢ Tuition, page 5

 

He said the committee’s work
will involve ‘‘some visitation to
campus.”

The committee will be
chaired by H. Gordon Leggett
Jr. of Lynchburg.

The Board met in committees
Friday morning and gathered
as a body to approve committee
recommendations on Saturday.

Friday afternoon was devoted
to an extensive discussion of
coeducation.

Rapist given 50-year sentence

by JOHN CLEGHORN
Chief Editor

A Lexington man was found
guilty in Rockbridge Circuit
Court yesterday for the Sept. 15
rape of a Randolph-Macon
Woman’s College student at a
Washington and Lee fraternity.

Daniel R. Tinsley, 21, of 224
Maury St., was convicted by an
eight-woman, four-man jury for
the rape which occured about
3:45 a.m. at Pi Kappa Alpha
following a party there.

He was sentenced to 50 years

in prison by Circuit Court Judge
George E. Honts III.
Commonweatlh’s Attorney
Beverly C. ‘‘John’’ Read called
three Washington and Lee stu-
dents to the stand in his pro-
secution of the case. The stu-
dents testified that they had
seen Tinsley with the victim on
the third floor of the fraternity
house the night of the rape.
Under questioning by Read,
Tinsley testified that on the the
night of the rape he had been to
a party at a nearby fraternity
but had not entered the Pika

house. Tinsley said he returned
home that night about 2 a.m.

When Read questioned Tin-
sley about the identity of the
victim Tinsley referred to her
previous testimony.

“I can say in my heart that
that’s the first time she (the vic-
tim) has ever seen me.”

Forensics tests showed that
the type of pubic hair found at
the scene of the attack cor-
responded to Tinsley’s.

At the time of the rape,
Tinsley was on parole for a

Review and Outlook

Cold policies

The public honor trial on Monday raised a number
of questions concerning the use of cold materials.
Although the precise issues in the case on trial seem-
ed clear cut, there are many peripheral issues that
should be addressed by the faculty so that further con-
fusion can be avoided.

 

The use of cold materials is increasingly common
at W&L. Many professors recommend it as a useful
study method. Volumes of cold tests are provided in
the library during exam periods.

But complications can arise when cold answers
enter the consideration. Any time cold materials are
used there is an inherent risk in that their use could
represent another student’s work to some extent.
Clear distinctions can be drawn when cold material is
used for study purposes, but confusion occurs when
cold answers are used in any way to answer home-
work or test questions.

The key to avoiding this type of confusion lies with
the individual faculty members. Each course is u-
nique and cold material is consequently used in a
wide range of ways. As with the case Monday, pro-
blems can be sidestepped if the instructor adresses all
types of study aids, especially cold material, and sets
the -guidelines for his particular course. Such in-
dividual policy setting, we think, would be a much
more advantageous solution than a university-wide
policy. Such a policy would only quickly become laden
with footnotes, explanations and exemptions par-
ticular to each course which would make it com-
paratively ineffective.

Although the bitter circumstances in which these
questions were raised are far from desirable, it is for-
tunate that they have been brought to light.

Letters

EC fails to represent students

To the Editors:

I am responding to the letter
from Bob Jenevein that was
printed in the Jan. 27 Phi. I
would like to point out to Mr.
Jenevein that the Executive
Committee is based upon the
idea of representative student
government, and unfortunately,
I don’t feel that my interests are
being represented. This feeling
springs from two sources, the
EC’s treatment (particularly
Jenevein) of the Independent
Union, and the controversial tie

issue.

First of all I would like to ad-
dress a number of points that
Mr. Jenevein put forth in his let-
ter. First of all, I’m not sure
who he encountered, but the In-
dependent Union had a very
large turn-out for their first

‘meeting. Secondly, I did not

realize that the ‘‘chucklings”’ of
a few of Mr. Jenevein’s friends
was a decision-making factor of
the EC’s budgetary decisions or
the legitimacy of the I.U.

Next, if 40 percent, even 10

percent of the W&L population
were ‘“camel-watchers” and
they set up an organized union
consisting of executive posi-
tions, a large membership and
some common goal, then I
would expect that they should
be able to receive a little of the
money that is supposed to be
used for their benefit. My God,
why should the Frisbee Club be
granted funds, and the Indepen-
dent Union be forced to live out
of Dean John and Dean Cappet-

‘We already have coeducation’

To the Editors:

Some young men, for various
reasons, find it very helpful to
have their masculinity, or sense
of sexual identity, reinforced by
experiencing for several years
in later adolescence a strictly

masculine enviornment. Such
an environment, such an at-
mosphere, was once provided
by our university. No more. A
choice? Meaningless.

In my time the faculty was all
male. There were no girls in the
classes. For sanitary reasons,

Student views requested

To the Editors:

The Calendar Committee is
seeking the views of the student
body regarding the academic
calendar. This questionnaire is
designed to obtain information
and suggestions concerning the
present calendar.

As you consider answering
this questionnaire, keep in mind
that any change from our pre-
sent calendar may entail
changes in both student load
(probably 5 courses in a
semester system) and faculty

load (probably 4 sections in a
semester system) as well as
changes in the daily class
schedules.

We would appreciate an early
reply to this questionnaire, and
we hope to hear from each of
you by February 24th. You may
pickup (starting February 20th)
and return this questionnaire to
the boxes placed in the Dining
Hall, Library, Co-op and
Registrar’s office.

Trial sparks comments

To the Editors:
The recent open honor trial
was a gross miscarriage of

justice and disgrace to the

honorable traditions of this in-
stitution. This farce exemplifies
some of the weaknesses of our
honor system that most certain-
ly should be mended. Although
both defendants admitted to us-
ing ‘‘unacknowledged aid’’ on
the assignment, without in-
cluding this in their pledge, they
were not convicted. We care too
much for the traditions of the
honor system to see them so
blatantly ignored.

Restraint

gives way
To the Editor:

I’ve calmly refrained fron,
commenting on the often
ridiculous commentary
emanating from coeducation
and its related issues over the
last few months because I felt
that everyone was entitled to
his opinion, But, unfortunately,
I can tolerate only so much.

Whose opinion, other than its
own, was the EC expressing last
week when it resolved that a
recommendation should be
made to the faculty that we

(continued on page 3)

The main weakness we
observed was the inequality of
the legal counsel. We find no
fault with Mr. Jenevein and Mr.
Judge, nor with the advocates
of the accused. But, the ad-
vocates for the EC did not have
the luxury of two-and-a-half
years of legal training to aid in
the presentation of their case.
We also believe that decisions

Correction

Because of a reporter’s error,
the Executive Committee’s vote
on coeducation was incorrectly
reported in last week’s Ring-
tum Phi. The correct vote was
11-0-1 against coeducation, with
Secretary Len Howard abstain-

ing.
Clarification
The Ring-tum Phi apologizes
for any confusion caused by last
week’s issue, which included an
eight-page Front Lawn supple-
ment on Virginia Military In-
stitute. A pressman’s error
caused The Front Lawn pages
to be mistakenly shuffled into
The Ring-tum Phi pages, in-
stead of being kept as a
separate center supplement.

bathing suits were not permit-
ted in the pool.
Today we have many female

' teachers, a fair number of girls

in the classrooms. Nude swim-
ming is not even an option, with
women allowed in the pool.

Let us not fool ourselves. The
masculine atmosphere is gone.
We already have coeducation.
Let us either phase out these in-
novations, or go the whole way.

I am adamantly opposed to
even the slightest increase in
the enrollment. I would rather
cut it to 1,300. And let us have no
sort of quota system for girls.
Let us admit students, not boys
and girls.

Media celebrities battle over necktie story

By BEN HALE
Phi Columnist

To tie or not to tie — that is
the question these days. It
seems to be an especially im-
portant question to the news
media. Actually the folks at The
Washington Post, The Roanoke
Times and World News, Rolling
Stone magazine, Good Morning
America and even George F.
Will are more concerned about
the EC tie recommendation
than most students around
here. I have been curious as to
why the media seems so con-
cerned about neckwear at our
little college in the Valley of
Virginia. Finally I decided to
get on the phone and find out,

putting in a call to Good Morn-
ing America. After several
minutes on hold, I was put
through to Clyde Crumbum,
David Hartman’s personal
secretary. He seemed to be try-
ing to hustle me off the phone
until I told him I had called
about the ties; he then became
very cordial.

to know why Good Morning
America had jumped on the lit-
tle obscure issue of our dress

Public trial results in

hypocrisy about honor

By JOHN CLEGHORN
Chief Editor

It is rare these days that a
student can spend a few hours

on the hill without hearing at

least one conversation between
students about any of the recent
actions of the Executive Com-
mittee. In the wake of charges
of student apathy, students are
~ now furiously chattering about
issues ranging from ties to the
Independent Union. Conse-
quently, many students have
come to know the members of
the EC both as individuals and
as a body in their student
government roles. Although re-
cent decisions have made
students painfully aware that
the members of the EC are
responsible for being represen-
tative of the students, many of

us, itseems, have forgotten that .

the EC also shoulders the
responsibility of upholding the
Honor System.

Comment

 

On Monday the University ex-
perienced a rare occurrence in
the public honor trial held in
Lee Chapel. A student had been
found guilty of an honor viola-
tion in a closed hearing and ap-
pealed to a jury of his peers for
a new judgment. To all but the
freshmen, such -public honor
trials are becoming increasing-
ly common. It is in these public
trials, and Monday was no dif-
ferent, that many students
forget that the EC also strives
to uphold the Honor System.

At times Monday, members
of the audience at. the trial
snickered, sneered, whispered
and laughed at the attempts by
Bob Jenevein and Dave Judge
to argue and prove their case to
the student jury. Finally, after
almost 11 hours of trial and jury
deliberation, the verdict was

announced. Audience members
cheered in unmistakeable de-
fiance of the EC and its then-
overturned ruling. Such a reac-
tion by any member of the W&L
student body, no matter the cir-
cumstance, is grossly inap-
propriate.

We at W&L take great pride
in our Honor System. It is rare,
if not unique, in that it has
withstood the onslaught of
changing generations and
values. The Honor System
works and because it does we
like to consider ourselves
‘gentlemen.’ It is this pride in
our Honor System and the con-
current show of disrespect for it
by more than a few students
Monday night which produces a
most embarrassing kind
hypocrisy.

Each year we elect the mem-
bers of the Executive Commit-
tee. They are the popular choice
for the job and all of its duties.
We also still rely on a confiden-
tial Honor System in which we
trust those elected members to
do their best in trying a student.
As the EC must perform part of
its job in secret, and as we still
uphold such a_ confidential
system, no one is justified in ac-
cusing it of trying to convict a
student outside the letter of the
law as defined in The White
Book.

But it was apparent Monday
that a number of such hypo-
crites were present. There they
were jeering and chuckling at
Jenevein and Judge who at that
point were the very embodi-
ment of the Honor System to
which we all cling desperately.
Many students quibble with the
EC members as student govern-
ment leaders and that is only
natural. But when we show that
same antagonism toward them
as they strive to ensure as best
they know how the survival of
the Honor System, our
hypocrisy is shameful.

“W&L is is spearheading the in-
evitable national swing toward
right-dress, and besides, we had
to act quickly to beat the Today
Show.” He went on to explain
that their sources confirmed
that Jane Pauley was trying to
slot Bob Jenevein and Jerry
Darrell even before the EC’s tie
vote, saying that she had
predicted the vote for months.

“This can’t be true,’’ I pro-
tested.

“Oh no,” Clyde replied, ‘‘This
is a tough business and a very
real issue. I am not kidding.
Besides we morning shows
must compete against the eve-
ning news shows. But there’s
where the real fight is bubbling
over the tie exclusive.”’

‘What fight?” says I, becom-
ing numb with disbelief.

‘‘Well,”’ Clyde chuckled, “‘the
word is that Bill Moyers and
Walter Cronkite are at logger
heads over who called first on
the feature.’’

“This isn’t the type story for
either of their shows, not to
mention...”

“Oh, this story has so many
leads it could fit on almost any
spot. I heard this morning that
Charles Kuralt was heading

down 11 South today.” I was
dumbfounded, but before I
could express my _ astonish-
ment, Clyde lowered his voice
to a whisper. ‘‘And,’’ he said,
“Tl let you know a secret.
Geraldo Rivera is planning a
big spot on the next 20/20 featur-
ing Jim Green, Markham Pyle,
Eddie Atwood and Dick
Miller.”’

“Hmmm,’’ I said, ‘‘Why isn’t
Bob Jenevein going to be on?’’
Clyde explained that Geraldo
had promised Time Magazine
the Jenevein exclusive. ‘“‘What
about President Wilson?”’ I ask-
ed.

“Oh,” Clyde said, “‘the show
only lasts one hour and he
thinks it would take a series to
get Wilson to address the
issue.”

I was almost chuckling with
shock and said, ‘I suppose
you’re going to tell me 60
Minutes is going to run the
ties.”’

‘‘They were,’’ Clyde
answered. ‘‘but Mike Wallace is
angry at Geraldo for beating
him to the draw and now says
he wouldn’t touch it. But I think
they’re making a big mistake.
Parade magazine is going to hit

it Sunday and then the flood
gates will open.”’

‘“‘Wait!’’ I half shouted, ‘‘why
in the world is everyone so in-
terested in this?”

“Oh my, you really don’t have
a clue,’’ Clyde sighed. He ex-
plained that it is known around
Washington that Jerry Falwell
is pushing the President to re-
quire ties on all government
employees at all times; he also
wants the president to recom-
mend to Tip O’Neil that con-
gressmen wear ties at all times
while in the D.C. city limits.
Clyde said everyone is convinc-
ed that Reagan agrees because
lately he has been walking
around the White House re-
citing a new Bible verse about
bare necks being the root of all
evil.

I was stupefied when Clyde
started to ask what I thought. I
began to try to explain how I
thought it would be nice if cer-
tain W&L traditions re-sprang
from their dormant roots. But
before I could address the ties
specifically, Clyde was rushing
me off the phone, saying some-
thing about a phone interview
with the W&L _ Bookstore
clothing selection staff at noon.

 

More ties

(continued from page 2)
students be required to wear
ties? Obviously, someone has
lost his mind making such a
recommendation without even
first consulting the student
body. Five members of the EC
are my fraternity brothers and
no members of my house knew
about this until we read it in The
Phi. Is that what the EC con-
siders responsible decision-
making?

The situation was bad
enough, but then the fearless
leader of the EC, Bob Jenevein,
was quoted in The Roanoke
Times and World News, as say-
ing that the wearing of ties
would further promote
homogeneity at W&L. Is he im-
plying that W&L needs to
become more homogeneous?
Come on now, James Watt
would not even make a com-
ment that ridiculous. But, none-
the-less, Bob did.

Tell me, is what we have now
at W&L a picture of multi-
dimensionality? I seriously
doubt that even the staunchest
of conservatives among us can
even begin to imagine a more
homogeneous community than
our little refuge on the Blue
Ridge.

Steve Matrazzo said it very
well last term when he noted
that the main reason W&L need-
ed coeducation was to relieve
the one-dimensionality that ex-
ists here in Lexington. Maybe
going coed is too great a step in
that direction for too many peo-
ple to fathom, but by reacting
with moves in the opposite
direction is not the solution to

«~ our problem.

If everyone would take the
time to read the University’s
formal statement on_ its
philosophy. in the catalogue,
they~would see that the main
purpose of this institution is the
development of minds in a
climate that stresses the impor-
tance of the individual. In no
way does this philosophy imply
homogeneity, conformity, or
what ever you want to label the
sitnation at W&L.

Prof. J.K. Jennings made a

Independents

(continued from page 2)
to’s pockets?

We as independents should be
given some consideration when
the budget is planned, and Mr.
Jenevein’s personal rantings
should not be taken too serious-
ly. Which brings me to my next
humorous consideration — the
issue of ‘‘asking”’ the faculty to
require us to wear ties to class.
This is very funny; the EC has
decided to say to the faculty on
an individual basis, ‘‘oh please
may we wear ties to your
class?” If the EC and/or
anyone else wants to wear ties
to class then the more power to
them, but I don’t feel it is
necessary for you to cry to the
teacher that I should wear a tie
too. The comment that springs
to mind is, “If I wanted to wear
a uniform, I would have gone to
VMI.”

Is this representation? I find
this more to be the instigation of
a few students who want to im-
pose their personal habits on

very noteworthy comment
when he said that when you re-
quire someone to conform to
tradition, that tradition ceases
to exist and becomes a rule.

The question we must ask
ourselves is do we really need
more rules. Hopefully the EC
will think about that (or at least
just think) the next time it
comes up with one of its
brilliant ideas.

when he created the honor

We don’t feel that we are
alone in this position, but rather
that a large portion of the stu-
dent body was horrified by the
scene that recently took place in
Lee Chapel. In closing, we
would like to repeat the words

Trustees give ‘tentative’ approval to pavilion

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

The Board of Trustees last
weekend approved the pavilion
project, with the size of the
building to be determined by
University President John D.
Wilson in ‘“‘direct consultation”
with Athletic Director William
N. McHenry

The student tax proposal sub-
mitted by the Executive Com-
mittee of the Student Body was
also endorsed by the Board.

Wilson said the trustees gave
the proposed student pavilion
“tentative approval, pending an
administrative recommenda-
tion and the May board
meeting.’”’

“The decision will come in
two parts,”’ he said. ‘‘We didn’t
have a clear decision on which
of the optional plans the Board
is willing to endorse, because of
the difference in capital costs.

“There will be a final recom-
mendation of the administra-
tion after we’ve refined our cost
and size figures,” he added.
“But I don’t think we’re losing
any time this way.”’

Frank Parsons, executive
assistant to the president and a
staff assistant to the Board’s
Planning and Development
Committee, said he expects
construction can begin by June
1.

‘“‘My expectation is that we
will resolve the size issue, pro-
ceed with planning and begin
building,” he said.

Parsons estimates that the
structure will be ready for use
five months after construction
is begun.

The pavilion, which has been
designed to accomodate be-
tween 1000 and 1200 students,
will be named for former
University President Robert
E.R. Huntley.

The site, one of three which
were considered, is in the pine
woods directly north of Lewis
Hall, about 500 feet from the
Buildings and Grounds com-

plex.

Two floor plans were
presented to the Planning and
Development committee.

One contained 7,440 square
feet of activity space (11,976
total), and one had 9,692 square
feet of activity space (14,700
total).

An additional plan was also
submitted for each of those
sizes, but with flooring,
lighting, and ceiling height
adapted for use by the athletic
department.

It is the latter two plans which
are under consideration.

The smaller size with the
higher ceiling, Parsons said,
was “no larger than the Student
Activities Board felt would
work for them, and no smaller
than the athletic department
thought would work for them.”

When President Wilson
reviewed the options, Parsons
said he viewed that plan ‘‘as be-
ing a reasonable compromise
among the needs of the S.A.B.,
the needs of the athletic depart-
ment, and the ability of the
University to provide additional
funds.”’

McHenry was one of those
present at the committee
meeting to assist in explaining
the features of the various plans
to the trustees.

“The committee felt that
some of the points made by Mr.
McHenry in response to ques-
tions from the trustees created
a strong argument for the
larger building,” Parsons said.

“They felt that perhaps
another look should be taken at
the feasibility of funding the
larger building.”

The financing plan approved
by the trustees calls for $25 of
the student taxes from each stu-
dent for the next 25 years to be
used as the student contribution
to the funding of the building.

Figuring enrollment at 1700
students per year yields
$1,062,500, of which $404,000 is
the principal on a loan at 9.5
percent from the University.

“The University would make
the funds available from the en-
dowment at this rate, which is
in line with the lending policies
of the University,’’ Parsons ex-
plained.

The difference between the
student contribution and the
proposed cost will be made up
by the trustees from the capital
projects budget.

In the case of the smaller
building, that would be $178,053

(total estimated cost: $582,053) ;
for the larger building, that
would be $273,475 (total
estimated cost. $677,475).

Parsons said that while the
resources available are limited,
“there were never any thoughts
expressed in Planning and
Development about limiting the
building to student funding on-
l eae
"He said that President Wilson
will make a recommendation on
the size ‘‘very soon.”’

“If there is any merit
discovered in the larger size,
then the final decision to con-

duct planning on that may
await the budget analysis we
will be going through very
shortly,’’ Parsons said.

“That will determine the
amount of capital available. It
may be that we can’t afford to
build the bigger building even if
we want to.”

Parsons said the Budget and
Audit Committee has a meeting
in the early spring at which it
determines a_ preliminary
budget, with final approval
coming at the May trustee
meeting.

‘In formal terms, approval

for the pavilion would come at
the May meeting. But in prac-
tical terms it would come when
the budget is finalized,”’ he said.

“At that point, it might be
possible to proceed with the
plans, and begin some
preliminary site work before
the May meeting.

“We don’t think there’ll be
any change in the trustees’ at-
titude toward the building.”

“The students have been very
creative and very positive in the
way they’ve approached it and
their willingness to be involved
through the tax,” Parsons said.

Trustees initiate coed study,
schedule meeting for July 13

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

The Board of Trustees last
weekend initiated an intensive
review of the possibility of ad-
mitting women to the Universi-
ty’s undergraduate program.

The study will be conducted
by the standing committees of
the Board, and will include a.
systematic survey of alumni
opinion on the question.

A tentative special session of
the Board was set for July 13-14
to assess the results of the in-
quiry. The subject will also be
discussed at the regularly
scheduled May 25-26 meeting.

Two sessions last weekend
were devoted to coeducation.

Board Rector (chairman)
James M. Ballengee said that
those were primarily
‘‘procedural rather than
substantive” in nature.

“I didn’t try to test the
temperature of the water at
all,”’ Ballengee said Tuesday.
‘I hope everyone still has an
open mind on the question.

“The Board has an obligation
to make a decision that’s in the
best interests of the University,
regardless of personal feelings.

“This is of course, a very im-
portant decision,” he continued.
‘‘Kither way, it will have great
consequences for the Universi-
ty.
“There has been a great deal
of heat on this question. Now we
hope there’Il be more light.”

“Each committee is free to
set its own agenda,’ said
University President John D.
Wilson. ‘‘It will be totally up to

them to do what they want to
about this.

“T will be working with each
chairman to help them relate to
the relevant groups on cam-
pus,”’ he said.

Each committee will have a
liaison in the administration to
assist it in its study.

The Committee on Academic

- Affairs, Wilson said, will ex-

amine staffing patterns, course
enrollment patters, classroom
and faculty office space, and
what changes would need to be
anticipated in those areas.

Working with Dean of the Col-
lege William J. Watt, the com-
mittee will also examine admis-
sions projections and _ alter-
natives, and new initiatives
which could be taken there.

Additionally, Academic Af-
fairs will look at the overall size
of the undergraduate school,
and how that size could or
should shrink or expand.

The new Committee on Cam-
pus Life, assisted by Dean of
Students Lewis G. John, will
assess the possible effects of
coeducation on the athletic pro-
gram and the fraternity
system.

The Planning and Develop-
ment Committee, in conjunc-
tion with Development Director
Farris P. Hotchkiss, will deal
with alumni reactions and in-
put, and, Wilson says, deter-
mine how communications can
be maintained with that group.

The Committee on Budget
and Audit, along with Universi-
ty Treasurer E. Stewart Epley,
will examine the impact of
coeducation on operating costs
and assess the capital and
renovative costs involved.

They also will look at the
number of students enrolled
and determine if present policy
should continue, or if the
number should shrink or ex-

pand.

Wilson said that the Ex-
ecutive Committee, which he
chairs, “thas the most difficult
task of all.

“We will be looking at the in-
tangibles — the spirit of Wash-
ington and Lee, its purpose, its
institutional character, and the
factors that make Washington
and Lee distinctive.

“‘We will make an evaluation
of its all-male character in that
context.”

Wilson said that this under-
taking is warranted, in spite of
the extensive study completed
in August 1975.

“Things change,’’ he said.
“The society has changed
some. We have a deeper set ot
institutional experiences to
draw on — Princeton, for exam-
ple.

‘We know a lot more about
this than we could have in 1975.

“Faculty opinion hasn’t
changed in any dramatic way,”
he continued. ‘‘Student opinion
will have changed — I’m not
sure how much.

“Life is a moving stream, and
so, too, are our social institu-
tions. They move, too, over
time.

‘We want to know how the
quality of Washington and Lee’s
academic, co-curricular and ex-
tracurricular programs can be
enhanced,” he said.

“Coeducation is clearly a
very conspicuous option among
others. But my hope is that,
should the Board decide to re-
main all-male, we will emerge
from this with a_ sharper,
clearer idea of how Washington
and Lee’s all-male character
contributes to its distinc-
tiveness.

“We won’t be content to say
that we’re all-male because we
haven’t yet been compelled to
change.”’

Wilson recently received a
letter dated Jan. 30 from a
trustee. It read in part:

‘“‘My mind remains quite open
on the coeducation issue, and it
is my intention to consider
every fact, opinion, concept,
perception, prediction, and idea
before deciding how I shall
vote.”

The Ring-tum Phi, February 9, 1984, Page 5

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

The tuition of $6,515 for the
1984-85 academic year which

was approved by the Board of -

Trustees last weekend repre-
sents a 12.3 percent increase
over this year’s fee of $5,800.

“We try to keep it as low as
possible,”’ said University
Treasurer E. Stewart Epley.
“We’re in good shape, com-
pared to other private institu-
tions.

“‘We haven’t priced ourselves
‘way beyond Wake Forest,
Duke, or Davidson,”’ he con-
tinued.

“Several trustees expressed
the sentiment that we could go

higher if we had to and still be

competitive with our indepen-
dent competitors.

“If anything, we’ve been on
the low side,”’ he said. ‘‘Now I
suspect we’re getting up so
we’re more comparable.

“Of course, we’re getting far-
ther and farther apart from
public institutions, of which we
have three in our own back-

yard,” he said, referring to the
University of Virginia, William
and Mary, and the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Initially, the tuition to be pro-
posed to the Budget and Audit
Committee was $6,500, but
Epley said that ‘last minute
refinements’’ increased it
slightly.

For purposes of planning the
budget for the fiscal year which
begins July 1, the University
projected inflation at 5 percent.

Epley pointed out several |

reasons that the tuition increase
is well above that rate.

All of the University’s sources
of revenue do not increase with
the cost of living, and, in fact,
the amount available for the
operating budget from two ma-
jor pools of capital will
decrease next year, he said.

The trustees this weekend
adopted what Epley called a
“more prudent’ formula for
determining the amount availa-
ble in a given year from the the
endowment and the Pratt Fund.

“It makes fewer dollars

available,’ the treasurer said.
“If the rules were in effect that
applied this year, there would
be $75,000 more available than
will be under the new rules.”

Another factor in the increase
is a reserve capital provision
which is being instituted next
year.

Also, Epley said that Presi-
dent John Wilson is _inter-
ested in increasing the level
of compensation for the faculty.

The Chronicle of Higher
Education reported on Feb. 8
that the average faculty
salaries at Washington and Lee
for the 1982-83 academic year,
not including fringe benefits,
are as follows:

Professor, $34,300; Associate
Professor, $25,000; Assistant
Professor, $21,300; and Instruc-
tor, $15,500.

Director of Admissions
William M. Hartog said that,
while ‘the cost structure
always has a significant im-
pact’’ on admissions, ‘‘our costs
are very competitive.

FC votes not to request ties

Decision ends two weeks of discussion

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

Faced with a petition signed
by 383 students, the Executive
Committee voted Sunday not to
ask the faculty to require ties in
the classrooms and merely en-
couraged students to wear ties
on campus.

Senior Mark Mitschow, with a

tie wrapped around his waist,
protested the EC’s original de-
cision two weeks ago to ask fac-
ulty members to require their
ty members to require tneir
students to wear ties to class.
The petition accused the EC of
making an “‘ill-timed and
ludicrous” decision that ‘does
not reflect the views of the stu-
dent body as a whole,” without
any input from the student
body.
“We wish to remind the EC
that they are neither autocrats
nor potentates,” the petition
continued, ‘‘but elected
representatives of the student
body.”

About 30 students were
shoehorned into the EC room
for Sunday’s debate during a
special meeting originally call-
ed to discuss the open exam pro-
posal, which was adopted
unanimously.

EC President Bob Jenevein
defended the original decision
but also pointed out the
clarification approved by the
EC the previous week.

“It’s the opinion of this com-
mittee that (the wearing of ties)
is a good thing,”’ Jenevein said.
“This committee admits that
we were out of line to (recom-
mend) that.

“We don’t pretend to tell peo-
ple how they can and cannot
dress.’’

Mitschow, who said about 10
man-hours were spent obtain-
ing signatures on the petitions,
said his biggest complaint was
that the EC didn’t get any sense
of student opinion before acting
on the issue.

“What bothered the people
was that one day they woke up
and they looked at the EC
minutes and they said, ‘Wow,
the EC has done this without
asking anyone,’”’ Mitschow
said.

“They’re very resentful and
I’m very resentful,”’ he added.

Senior Lee Feldman said he
supported the EC’s decision
because the EC members are
elected representatives of the
student body and can’t consult
every student.

“They’re going to consult the
people who are close at hand,”
Feldman said, ‘‘and I think the
EC’s done that. They did what
was within their bounds and I
think they did it well.”’

Vice president Dave Judge
echoed Feldman’s point. “We
can’t take a referendum on
everything we do here,” he
said.

Just as citizens have the right
to petition their congressmen,
though, Mitschow said, students
have a right to petition the EC.

“I believe you owe them an
explanation,” he added. “‘If a
professor doesn’t like what
someone’s wearing, that’s his
business. That’s not the
business of the Executive Com-
mittee. I would think that you

gentlemen have something bet-
ter to do with your time.”

Jenevein said, ‘“The intention
of this committee was solely to
benefit Washington and Lee. We
felt it would result in an improv-
ed atmosphere in direct propor-
tion to the number of ties
worn.”

Secretary Len Howard said
he believed the EC should have
had a wider discussion on this
issue.

“Even though we are en-
trusted with certain rights and
responsibilities, that doesn’t
mean we're infallible,”” Howard
said.

He added that he stands
behind the original decision, but
made the motion for the EC to
merely explain the issue and its
intentions to the faculty without
asking them to require ties.

Howard’s motion, seconded
by junior representative Darby
Brower, passed unanimously,
ending 30 minutes of debate.

Senior representative Jim
Messer represented the EC at
Monday’s faculty meeting and
said he was well received and
that the faculty understood the
EC’s actions.

Freshman Steve Pockrass
presented another petition,
signed by 105 students, calling
on Jenevein to ‘quote facts,
rather than merely presenting
his own personal opinions” and
to properly represent the stu-
dent body on national televi-
sion.

Jenevein confirmed that he
had been invited to appear on
ABC’s ‘‘Good Morning,

(continued on page 12)

sive private university,” he
said. ‘“‘We are generally quite a
bit less expensive than our
private northeastern com-
petitors, and we’re less than
many schools around the
South.”

Hartog named Washington
and Lee’s primary private
Southern competition as David-
son, Duke and Vanderbilt.

He pointed out that ‘“‘we have
in our own state two presti-
gious, nationally-known public
institutions,’ and said it was in
those two schools and in Chapel
Hill that the most students
enrolled who were also admit-
ted to Washington and Lee.

A survey last September of
371 students who declined ad-
mission to Washington and Lee
showed that 24 percent were in-
fluenced by the cost, and 14 per-
cent named it as the number
one factor in not coming to the
school.

Hartog said that the area in

  

- Tuition to increase to $6,515

which the tuition increase
“really has impact”’ is in finan-
cial aid.

“At a school like this, when
we go up significantly in tuition,
that puts pressure on financial
aid, which has an impact on ad-
missions,’’ he said.

Hartog said this pressure is
partly the result of the fact that
no student’s tuition is used to

_ Supplement another student’s.

“‘We are one of a handful of
schools that does not apply a
percentage of tuition revenue to
financial aid,’’ he said.

That type of “redistribution”
of tuition, he said, is ‘‘a short-
term remedy, but a long-term
disaster,” because ‘‘you have to
keep raising the tuition until
you price yourself out of the
market.”

“I don’t think any of us can
lose sight of the fact that for a
number of years, we have been
a very well-managed, well-run
institution,”’ he said.

members, nine belong to frater-
nities, and five belong to the
same fraternity.

Of the 12 members on the EC,
10 — including three from
Texas and three from Georgia
— are from southern states.

Only two of the members had
served on the EC before this
year.

This homogeneity is
represented in nearly every
vote, every decision the EC has
made this year. The closest vote
on an issue of any significance
was a 93 vote not to pay
students to man the polls during
elections. And even the three
(President Bob Jenevein,
sophomore _ representative
James White and freshman
representative Andrew
Caruthers) who voted for the
proposal did so for different
reasons: Caruthers, for exam-
ple, didn’t see a need for anyone
to man the polls at all.

On nearly all other issues,
even such potentially explosive
ones as coeducation, spring
term, Wédnesday night parties
and the wearing of ties, votes
have been unanimous, perhaps,
with an abstention or two.

Perhaps this is due to skillful
behind-the-scenes manipulating
and expert leadership by Jene-
vein. While there seems to be
little question that he confers
with other EC members before
bringing a provocative issue to
the floor, the outcome almost
undoubtedly is a result of the
homogeneity.

This is further exemplified by
the fact that issues often are
resolved with little discussion
and compromise during the
open meetings. What discussion
there is usually consists of dif-
ferent members espousing
basically the same ideas.

Of course, this is not entirely
a fault of the EC, because the
lack of debate on most issues
enables meetings to move
smoothly and questions to be
resolved rapidly. The casual
observer, though, sometimes
gets the opinion that perhaps
not all student interests are be-
ing represented. Then again, if
students want their interests
represented, they can go to an
EC meeting to express them or
at least tell their represen-
tative.

This all boils down to the sim-
ple question of whether the Ex-
ecutive Committee should be
responsive or responsible.

A responsive EC considers
the wishes and desires of every
group of students before mak-
ing a decision. A responsible EC
makes decisions that, although

perhaps not appreciated by
many students, may prove
beneficial to the university.

The 1983-84 EC, thus far, has
been more responsible than
responsive, particularly earlier
this semester through such ac-
tions as denying funds to the In-
dependent Union and asking
professors to require their
students to wear ties to class.

Within the last two weeks,
though, there has been a shift
toward responsiveness as Jene-
vein delayed a decision on the
pavilion for a day and on the
student advisers for a week so
that members would have an
opportunity to sound out their
classmates on these issues.

Following the actions of
previous ECs, this year’s EC
has formed many subcom-
mittees to investigate such
things as social activities in
conjunction with Randolph-
Macon Woman’s College, open
exams, independent life and a
gift of appreciation for former
W&L President Robert E.R.
Huntley. Most of these subcom-
mittees, with a few exceptions
(R-MWC, independents and ad-
ditional lighting in the parking

Jot), have been effective.

Perhaps the most effective
was the finance subcommittee,
which reviewed all budget re-
quests and made recommenda-
tions to the entire EC, This sub-
committee expedited the
budgetary process tremendous-
ly but again exemplified the
EC’s homogeneity.

Of the finance subcom-
mittee’s 17 recommendations 12
were adopted by the EC, often

unanimously and frequently
with little debate. In past years,
this process has lasted until the
wee hours of the morning. This
year, it was over by 11 p.m.

Again, this is another aspect
of the responsive-responsible
debate. The EC acted respon-
sibly by having most of the in-
itial discussions and debates
take place in the finance sub-
committee. Some would ques-
tion, though, whether having
nearly all debate take place
behind closed doors is respon-
sive,

One problem that could have
plagued the EC this year, but
usually doesn’t appear during
open meetings, is the fact that
10 of the 12 members had never
served on the EC before. Only
junior representatives Darby
Brower and Cole Dawson had
previous EC experience.

Whether this inexperience
has presented any problems in
the EC’s other jurisdiction
—honor cases — is a question
that cannot, of course, be
answered.

As the Executive Committee
turns down the backstretch and
heads for home, with Big Three
elections less than a month
away, it has tackled many
issues of importance to this
university and has tackled most
of them responsibly and has
made some difficult decisions.

Whether these decisions have
been correct and have ac-
curately represented the feel-
ings of the student body are
matters for the voters to decide
next month.

 

 

  

BOB JENEVEIN

Despite the criticism he has
received in the past few weeks,
Executive Committee Presi-
-dent Bob Jenevein seems to
have done a respectable job in a
tough, time-consuming _posi-
tion. ;

Jenevein’s biggest drawback
has been his lack of prior EC ex-
perience, and this occasionally
has shown during meetings and
in other actions. —

On at least two occasions,

Jenevein has said during an~

open meeting something that
was told him confidentially and
afterward had to ask reporters
to refrain from printing it. On
other occasions, Jenevein will
make statements directed espe-
cially for the media present (he
is a political science major),
but his politicking is not a
serious fault.

Jenevein’s' most serious
mistake may have been the
curtness with which he treated
the Independent Union’s budget
request during the Jan. 9
meeting and in a letter to The
Ring-tum Phi. The EC Presi-
dent seemed to forget that 35

percent of his constituency are

independents.

Jenevein may have been
right, though, in charging that
part of the fault lay with the
IU’s inability to assess dues and
meet with the Student Activities
Board. Appointing a subcom-
mittee Oct. 31 to investigate the
problem, he said, ‘‘It’s
(independent life) certainly an
issue that’s come to the
forefront.”

Enough has been written
about the recent tie debate, both
in this newspaper and in others
around the country, so that
everybody should know that
Jenevein apparently still favors
the idea.

The whole question of student
apathy and a dress code seems
to stem from a November
Omicron Delta Kappa sym-
pusium, after which Jenevein
told the EC that the consensus
of the participants was that
“‘we’ve slipped in a lot of dif-
ferent ways,’”’ such as_ the
speaking tradition and the dress
code.

Jenevein must be credited for
turning what could have been a
nasty debate Sunday night into
a reasonably calm discussion of
the tie decisions, resulting in an
outcome that seemed to satisfy
all involved.

Jenevein apparently has
worked closely with President
John Wilson on the coeducation
issue and is to commended for
asking and being allowed, to
participate in last weekend’s

Jenevein’s quibbles may have
been valid, there was little ap-
parent reason to bring them up
during a public meeting.

After criticizing Howard,
Jenevein turned to vice presi-
dent Dave Judge, who had
prepared a memo to all student
organizations about budget
reports and asked the EC to ap-
prove the memo _ without
Judge’s reading it. ‘‘Let’s just
approve what Dave’s done and
trust Dave,’’ Jenevein siad.
“‘That’s a good job, Dave, and I
appreciate it.”

Meetings have run smoothly
and generally under control
thus far this year, but squabbles
among the Big Three must be
resolved if the EC is to achieve
ultimate effectiveness.

As president, Jenevein has
the responsibility for guiding
the EC and for controlling the
meetings and handling _in-
dividual grievances. Drawing
on leadership skills gained as a
co-captain of the football team,
Jenevein has basically ac-
complished those respon-
sibilities. After the necktie
issue, though, increased
pressure will be on him to per-
form with all of the students in
mind.

 

{bp

seems to have made sensible
decisions as to whether the EC
can afford additional expen-
ditures. For example, he ap-
proved of giving the Political
Review an additional $500 for a
second issue and voted against
paying students to man the polls
during EC elections.

Working with SBA treasurer
Cheryl Boggs, Judge helped
establish a new account system
for the SBA that helped clear up
many past problems.

On the pavilion issue, though,
which would involve raising the
student tax by $25, Judge has
had little to say, although he did
support raising the tax.

Judge did represent the stu-
dent body during the meetings
of the Alumni Association and
the Board of Trustees last fall,
when Jenevein was playing
football.

Judge was the major force
behind forcing the Student
Association for Black Unity to
spend its $1,500 on the SABU
Ball, for which the money
originally had been intended.
SABU had planned to split the
money between the ball and a
speaker. Thus, Judge helped
establish a precedent that
organizations must spend their
money for what they say they
are going to spend it for.

After many weeks of confu-
sion, Judge also finally worked
out a schedule for organizations
to present budget reports to the
EC

 

LEN HOWARD

Secretary Len Howard, the
lone independent on the EC, has
done his best to champion the
cause of the independents this
year, but has been out-
numbered on most issues by the
other members of the Big
Three, Jenevein and Judge.

Howard has hurt his cause
somewhat through his chair-
manship of two apparently inef-
fective subcommittees, one to
arrange joint social functions
with Ranolph-Macon Woman’s
College and the other to study
the problems of the in-
dependents.

Formed Sept. 19, the R-MWC

Secretary
Len Howard

committee did not even fill all
its positions until December
and had not scheduled a
meeting until the middle of
January. This may have been a
good idea that never got off the
ground.

The independent subcom-
mittee — as demonstrated by
the antagonism among the In-
dependent Union, the EC and
the SAB — seems to have done
little toward that problem.

Howard’s failure on many oc-
casions to post the minutes of
EC meetings until several days
after the meeting also has hurt
him and brought some criticism
from Jenevein. However, the
minutes generally have been
accurate.

The highlight of Howard’s
year thus far may have been his
ability to forge a compromise
Sunday between the EC and
students protesting the necktie
decision. When the meeting
threatened to degenerate into a
shouting match, Howard seized

the initiative and introduced a
proposal acceptable to
everyone.

Howard did write a letter re-
questing the hiring of a student
organization secretary. Wheth-
er this will produce any
results is yet to be seen.

When Contact’s budget re-
quest came before the EC,
Howard was the sole person to
vote against granting the
organization $9,400, because it
was more than Contact would
be receiving from the Inter
Fraternity Council.

‘“‘Why the decision to hit the
EC for 13 (thousand dollars,
Contact’s original request) and
the IFC for only eight? Is it real-
ly fair for the EC to foot the
larger portion of the bill?”
Howard asked.

In the weeks ahead, Howard
may have to take even more in-
itiative while diligently per-
forming his usual duties if he is
to get anywhere against the
homogeneity of the EC.

 

 

DARBY BROWER

Jumwor representative

Darby Brower

Junior representative Darby
Brower, the only member of the
EC who also served last year,
has used his experience to con-
tribute greatly to the EC’s ac-
tivities this year.

Brower’s work with the Stu-
dent Activities Board in for-
mulating the plans for the stu-
dent activities building
(pavilion) apparently was
momentous and may benefit
generations of students to
come. He originally began
working on the pavilion idea
last spring and has not stopped
since.

Brower also has spoken out
against giving additional
money to organizations he

doesn’t feel deserve it, such as
the Independent Union (‘I
would find it impossible to give
you all any money”’) and the In-
ternational Club for the Mock
United Nations (“I myself
would be upset, let alone the
people who are paying the tax-

‘es.’’) The rest of the EC agreed

with him in both cases.

Sometimes, it almost seemed
as though Brower were leading
the EC, or at least helping Jene-
vein, and he has put his
previous EC experience to good
use both in open meetings and
in committees.

If Brower wants a Big Three
position next year, he certainly
would be a deserving candidate.

 

COLE DAWSON

 

Jumior representative

Cole Dawson

Junior class representative
Cole Dawson has devoted
almost the entire year thus far
to chairing the open exam sub-
committee and has done a
remarkable job of resolving the
various conflicts and pounding
out a workable proposal.

Dawson has worked effective-
ly to iron out the problems the
Commerce School had with the
open exam policy — problems
that prevented a similar pro-
posal from getting anywhere
last year.

Dawson also has remained
patient in dealing with the
quirks of the faculty and the
Faculty Executive Committee
(which was unable to obtain a
quorum the day it was supposed
to vote on the proposal last
week ).

Dawson has parlayed the ex-
perience he gained as a fresh-
man class representative two
years ago into a position as one
of the more respected EC
members.

His value to this EC also
stems from the fact that he is
one of the student represen-
tatives to the faculty EC, where
nearly all important faculty
decisions originate. Dawson has
kept the rest of the student EC
informed of what the faculty is
doing.

Dawson has made few sug-
gestions outside of his work
with the open exams, but he
usually contributes to most
discussions. Dawson certainly
could be a potential candidate
for a higher position next year.

 

JIM GREEN
Semior law rep
Jim Green

While upperclass law
representative Jim Green’s
performance in honor situations
and subcommittee delibera-
tions may be worthwhile (he did
serve on the finance subcom-
mittee), his contributions to the
open EC meetings sometimes
have been meaningless.

You have to give this much to
Green: He’s not afraid to speak
his mind:

— ‘I’m not sure what it’s
tried to do,’’ he said about the
Political Review. '

— ‘I’m wondering if we can
afford a Frisbee Club at all.”’

— ‘Well. That’s nice... think
we ran out of money the first
time,” he said when the
Political Review asked the EC
for an additional $500 for a se-
cond issue.

— ‘‘We applaud John D. Wil-
son as president of this univer-
sity...a gifted and conscientious
administrator...,’’ Green wrote
in a letter trying to quelch
rumors flying around campus.

Green, apparently a fiscal
conservative, also voted to pay
students to man the polls during
EC elections.

As many law students are
wont to do, Green will cite
volume and verse of the law
code during EC meetings, even
if it doesn’t apply.

Representing the law stu-
dents has been Green’s only ap-
parent strong point. He suc-
ceeded in having the finance
subcommittee’s recommenda-
tion for the Student Bar
Association, $17,907, raised to
$18,354.67. And he made the mo-
tion to rescind the requirement
that upperclass law students
sign their honor cards in order
to vote in EC elections.

Still, the major responsibility
of the upperclass law represen-
tative should be to bridge the
gap between the law school and
the undergraduate campus.
Few moves have been made
toward bridging that gap this
year.

Perhaps Green’s’ most
notable accomplishment was
his receipt, by a unanimous
vote of the EC, of the ‘First An-
nual Wounded Beached Whale
Award.”’

in elections, several law
students showed up during the
EC meeting to complain.
Eleven EC members backed
the original policy; one,
Caruthers, suggested that the
EC rescind its earlier actions,
only to be told off by Jenevein.
The following week the EC,
faced with an onslaught of law
school protest, did indeed re-
scind the honor card require-
ment by a unanimous vote.
Caruthers always has ex-
pressed his opinions, no matter
how much he disagrees with
other members. He questioned
the need to man polls at all dur-
ing elections. (‘‘The freshmen
are kind of in the dark about
why there needs to be people
manning them’), and said
about the pavilion, “I’d like a
building we could grow into.”’
When the plus/minus poll was
taken, Caruthers lobbied for the
freshmen to be_ included.
Although unsuccessful, his ef-
forts showed that he has looked
out for the wishes of his class,
as well as for the entire school.

Freshman law rep
Steve Grist

Perhaps the most difficult
job, in terms of representation,
on the EC is that of the first-
year law representative. The
reason is that this person is not
elected until almost two months
after law school classes begin
and thus doesn’t have a whole
lot of time to accomplish much.

Steve Grist, this year’s first-
year law representative, has
done a little better job than his
predecessors and generally has
stood up for the rights of the law
students, even in such seeming-

On a vote to sponsor last mon-

the Lexington bureaucracy
over the seemingly eternal pro-

Messer and James White serve
on the “Lexington Lighting and

which is attempting to resolve
the problem.

Messer served on the finance
subcommittee that reviewed
budget requests at the begin-
ning of the year and made
recommendations to the entire
EC.

However, he has, on occasion,
adopted seemingly hypocritical
stances on various issues. For
example, during debate over
whether drug dealing should be
considered an honor violation,
Messer said, ‘‘I’d love to be able
to do it, but I think we’re going
to get in trouble trying to do it.”

He voted for the measure,
though.

Senior representative
George Youmans

Senior class representative
George Youmans is one of the
quietest members of this year’s
EC.

Youmans’ contributions to
discussions rarely range much
further than to agree with a
point someone else has already
made, and he rarely introduces
any new items for discussion.

Youmans did serve on the
open exam subcommittee with
Cole Dawson and presumably
helped with that proposal.

When the Independent Union
appeared before the EC to re-

quest student tax funds,

Youmans quickly suggested
that the IU should charge dues,
perhaps five dollars per mem-
ber, before coming to the EC for
money.

He was one of the few people
on the EC who questioned the
necessity of having the Student
Association for Black Unity
spend its funds like it had told
the EC the funds would be used.

_ Youmans said he didn’t see

anything wrong with shifting
funds from the SABU Ball to a
speaker, an intellectual event.

Sophomore. representative

James White

For a first-time EC mem-
ber, sophomore representative
James White has been effective
and seems genuinely concerned
for the interests of the Washing-
ton and Lee student body as a
whole.

White lost perhaps his biggest
battle of the year, even though
he had the support of EC Presi-
dent Bob Jenevein. White
orignially proposed that the EC
pay students to man the polls
during EC elections after the
returns from the freshman
class elections had to be
discarded and the election held
again.

‘‘We need some kind of incen-
tive to get people out there,”
White said.

White backed his proposal

‘through two. EC meetings

before losing on a 9-3 vote.

White himself manned the
polls during the coeducation
poll last month. He was in
charge of developing the ques-
tions, obtaining people to man
the polls and tabulating the
results. The turnout of nearly 60
percent is a tribute to his ef-
forts.

When the issue of what to do
about various rumors flying
around campus came up, a sug-
gestion was made at the EC
meeting to draft a statement
supporting President Wilson.
White wasn’t so sure that should
be done, though, and he said,
“Are you sure you’re represen-
ting the whole student body
when we say this?”’

Sophomore. representative
Ken Lindeman

Sophomore representative
Ken Lindeman has_ been
another relatively quiet
member of this year’s EC.

His most important duty was
the writing of a letter to The
Ring-tum Phi concerning noise
and food in the library, and
even then he had to be cajoled
into writing the letter.

However, Lindeman general-
ly does participate in discus-
sions, even if he rarely offers
any new ideas or brings any
complaints or problems before
the EC.

Lindeman missed two crucial
meetings within the past few
weeks. He was absent Jan. 23,
when the EC made its necktie
decision and he also missed two
special meetings, the Jan. 26
meeting to approve the open ex-
am policy and the Jan. 31
meeting to discuss the proposed
student activities building.

When ad hoc reports were
presented a few weeks ago,
Lindeman, an ad hoc member
of the Student Bar Association
said he had yet to be contacted

about a meeting. Perhaps he
needs to be a little more ag-
gressive both during regular
meetings and in other situations
in order to be a completely ef-
fective representative.

Artist describes her influences

By SCOTT PRYSI
Staff Reporter

Ann Glover of Roanoke, Va.,
is currently exhibiting a collec-
tion of her most recent water-
color and oil paintings in du-
Pont Gallery. She graduated
from Mary Baldwin College in
1972 with a degree in studio art
and has recently taught pain-
ting at the Roanoke Museum of
Fine Arts and Virginia Western
Community College. Her work
has been included in over 20
group exhibits and six solo
shows since 1978. Nearly all of
the paintings in this exhibit
depict her impressionistic inter-
pretation of a landscape similar
to Goshen near Arcadia, just
south of Lexington.

A few hours before the recep-
tion in duPont Gallery last Fri-
day, which officially opened her
show, she discussed her back-
ground, artistic influences and
method of painting.

Q. When did you first begin
painting?

A. With oil paints, at Mary
Baldwin, about 1969. I was do-
ing full-length portraits there. I
did not, to my surprise, become
a painter immediately after
graduation. I worked in
Charlottesville for two years as
a short-order cook, then went
into advertising as a graphic
designer. I finally began to
paint nearly full-time in 1978.

Q. When were the works in
this show done?

A. Most of the watercolor
sketches and oil painting of Ar-
cadia were done this past sum-
mer and fall. The four interior
still-lifes were done earlier,
sometime in the spring of last
year.

Q. On the average, how long
did the paintings in this show
take to complete?

A. The watercolors took about
two days. The oils took from a
week to eight or nine months.
That’s not working every day
but just looking at it and coming
back to it many times.

Q. How are working in oils
and working in watercolors dif-
ferent?

A. The logistics of each kind
of painting are different. The
watercolors are done on a flat
drawing board with all the col-
ors within a square-foot area,
literally. It’s much less of an
athletic event than working
with oils which require a great
deal of movement and mixing of
colors. The smell is very dif-
ferent also.

Q. There seems to be a
chromatic link between all the
paintings in this show. There is
an aqua-blue in almost every
work. Did you purposely do
this?

A. No. I think it’s a color I
need to see right now. It’s not
like a favorite color, but one I
need to use. For a while I had to
see red and black. It probably
will disappear.

Q. When I go out to Goshen
and look at scenes like what you
are depicting, I don’t see these
brilliant colors. Is this what you
actually see or do you add color
to enhance the painting?

A. There are interpretations
of what I see. I take liberties
with the colors I see. Since I
have the license and the choice
to change the colors slightly, to
intensify them, I do that. But I
try to allow the natural color to
give me the suggestion.

Q. Why do you paint?

A. I identified with the
picture-making works in the se-
cond grade. And early that was
an escape from uncomfortable
situations — from math class to
any social situation which to me
was overwhelming. I share that
with a lot of people who enjoy
things that involve solitude
—like writing music. By
temperament I was suited to
solitary pursuit. I want to make
some record of the awesome
things I see around me
—whether it’s in a fish-bowl or
in dishes in the sink or on a win-
dowsill. It involves a personal
interpretation. That, I feel, is
my job.

Q. Everyone who walks into
the Gallery certainly has come
reaction to your work. Do you
want people to like it?

A. Since my work is about a
place I think is awesome or
wonderful in terms of visuals
and evidence of something
magnificent, I try tomake some
approximation of it and always
fall short. I will always fall
short and feel frustrated. They
are pleasing to me. The best
thing that could happen would
be for someone to see my work,
then look at a place similar to
Arcadia with more clarity and
meaning. I don’t want to flatter
the place or just please people
but I want to clarify and
simplify an enormously com-
plex scene.

Q. You use photographs to
complete some of the paintings
you do. How do they influence
your work?

Long Necks

   

A. I need them for the large
shapes. For an oil painting I
spend quite a while just looking
at the landscape. I make
sketches in pencil and water-
color and take photographs of
the area. Back in my studio I
refer to the photographs to
check on details and general,
larger forms. I don’t use them
as a color guide.

Q. What direction do you see
your painting taking?

A. I want to take several of
my paintings and blow them up
to a very large scale — about
the size of an entire wall — us-
ing pieces of cut paper of
various colors. That’s
something I want to work with
soon.

Q. Why?

A. I want to simplify the
shapes and colors in work I’ve
already done. Two or three
shades of a color will become
one.

Glover is strongly influenced
by 19th century Impressionism
and particularly the work of
Mary Cassat. Her fascination

shapes her paintings, which are |

dominated by subtle, natural
shapes and an impressive range
of brilliant colors. Her work will
remain on display in duPont

‘Angel’ defiles

the silver screen

By CHARLIE ALCORN
Staff Reporter

As a rule films usually come
under one of three headings
here in Lexington; Foreign,
First Run, and B movies. I per-
sonally refuse to relegate the
movie Angel, to any one of these
three catagories for fear of tain-
ting the good name of show bus-
iness. No, Angel, is in a class by
itself. (F-, perhaps).

Never has the silver screen
been so defiled by such sopho-
moric dialogue, moronic plot or
cliched setting. But what sets
this movie apart as a classic in
garbage is the mindbending
cast of characters.

For example, the villian is no
less than a_ schizophrenic-
necrophiliac with an Oedipus
Complex who sucks raw eggs
(with shell), pumps cinder
blocks for jollies, washes with
Ajax and kills hookers while
doubling as a Hare Krishna.
They didn’t show him eating his
buggers, but I bet he does.
Anyway, they just don’t come
any better than this guy.

The heroine is your basic high
school honor student turned

hooker by night. This role is
toughingly played by newcomer
Donna Wilkes (smart money
says she’s the new Dorothy
Stratten). The supporting cast
includes a transvestite with a
heart of gold, a dyke who makes
Wendy O. Williams look like the
Ivory Soap baby, an octogener-
ian Kit Carson impersonator
who is rumored to have a hot
iron in his pants, and a black
who is portrayed as being so
dumb that the NAACP should
file suit. There is one straight
guy, Hollywood Cop Anderson,
whose brilliant detective work
leaves Angel no other choice
than to avenge her cohort’s
deaths with a .357 Magnum.

I’m chomping at the bit to rail
on the final scene, but such a
classic piece of celluloid has to
be seen to be appreciated
(believed? ).

My recommendation to the
W&L moviegoer: by all means
go see it. It will make you feel
like Einstein himself compared
to the guys who made this farce.
Haggling, however, is required
at the box office because high-
way robbery is illegal, even in
Lexington.

 

 

‘The Cottage’ portrays incarcerated life
by using realism and improvisation

By BOB BRYANT
Staff Reporter

“If you put anyone behind
bars, they act like animals,”’
said Ted Petrides, whose play
“The Cottage,’’ was presented
at the Boiler Room Theatre this
week. The one-act play centers
on the initiation of a new inmate
to the social hierarchy of a
juvenile detention center.
Petrides describes his work as a
“living script. We add stuff
every night, and that’s part of
the whole process.”

This week’s production is just
one step in the writing of the
play, according to Petrides.

‘“‘What happened was I wrote
the play once, turned it in think-
ing I had finished it, and my
professors kind of panned it,”
he said. ‘‘They thought the plot
was contrived, and the story
was kind of boring. They said,
‘Let’s improvise it.’ ” He then
had actors perform improvisa-
tional exercises based on situa-
tions in the original script.

“These gave me a much bet-
ter feel for it. My biggest pro-
blem was natural dialogue: just
setting the words down on
paper. I had done all my re-
search, I knew what I was try-
ing to say, I was just having
problems accomplishing it,”’ he
added.

Each actor was given a
character in the detention
center and told to play certain
objectives, which Petrides
observed and used in his final

script.

‘We would say, ‘Gus, I want
you to go to George’s locker and
take his brownies. Your goal is
to eat as many of the brownies
you can and have no one get
upset at you.’ That would force
that actor to use the manipula-
tive qualities that his character
has. In this way we developed
the characters as well as the
situation,” he said.

Petrides said this improvisa-
tional process has been used in
writing such works as “A
Chorus Line,’’ ‘‘Nicholas
Nickleby” and ‘‘Hair.”’ ‘‘It’s an
old process but one that hasn’t
been used at W&L for a while,”’
he added.

Petrides originally intended
to major in sociology at
Washington and Lee. He draws
heavily on his background in
that discipline in the writing of
“The Cottage.”

“As a writer, social problems
are very good topics to write
about. I need to care about
something, and I feel I need to
teach people something,” he
said.

He was inspired to write
about detention centers after a
friend who worked at one told
him it might be a good subject
for a play. As part of his
research he spent several days
observing young people at the
Natural Bridge Learning
Center, which he describes as
“one of the best in Virginia,’
and visited juvenile homes in
Philadelphia. ‘‘I’ve had people
tell me, ‘Anything you write in-

to the play could actually hap-
pen,’ they’re so bad,’’ he said.

“There are several different
ways a student can be exploited
or victimized in these places,”
he added. ‘‘Other inmates do
things to alienate a newcomer
and put him on the low end of
the inmate subculture. In our
play the central character is
Vanny, who’s a naive, pretty
nice kid when he came in.
Rather than using other types of
corrective measures, his father
recommends that he be placed
in one of these homes, and by
the end of the play he is doing
bad things and has become a lot
more of a jerk.”’

Petrides uses Danny to
demonstrate a phenomenon
known as “labeling.” ‘Once
you’ve been given so many
labels and called so many bad
things, like ‘troublemaker’ or
‘burn-out’ by the end of the day
you begin to believe what
they’re saying about you,” he
said.

After this production'is over,
Petrides plans to sit down and
write the finished product,
which he will turn in for his
senior thesis. Although ‘The
Cottage”’ is a one-act, he hopes
the final version to be a full-
length play.

The actors Petrides has been
working with are David Marsh,
Chris Carmouche, Blake
O’Neill, Ned Richardson and
Turner Friedman, all of whom
are sophomores. Senior Bob
Ferguson directed the produc-
tion.

Cagers upset Bridgewater

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
basketball team continued its
streak of inconsistency this
week.

The Generals crushed Emory
& Henry on Thursday night, lost
on Saturday night to a Lynch-
burg team it had already
defeated earlier in the season,
and defeated on Tuesday night
a Bridgewater team it had
already lost to earlier in the
season.

W&L’s record stands at 13-8
overall and 8-4 in the Old Domi-
nion Athletic Conference with
four regular season games re-
maining, all on the road against

ODAC opponents, including the
rematch against archrival
Roanoke Saturday night at 7:30.
The Generals are in third
place in the ODAC, behind
Bridgewater (9-3) and Roanoke
(10-1). The fourth-place team is
Lynchburg, with a 6-5 record.
The ODAC tournament will
begin on Tuesday, Feb. 21, and
will be the first game played
after W&L students return from
February break. If the Gener-
als end the season among the
top four teams in the con-
ference, they will host a
quarterfinal game at 7:30 that
evening in Warner Center.

game for senior co-captains
John Lee Graves and Chris
Baldwin.

The team rose to the occasion
by breezing past the Eagles,
who had defeated W&L 64-53 on
Jan. 14.

Graves turned in another
stellar performance, scoring 26
points — including two on a
slam-dunk that brought the
crowd to its feet — and grab-
bing 10 rebounds.

Graves now has 1,350 career
points at W&L, putting him
eighth on the all-time list. He
passed Brian Hanson Tuesday
night, who graduated last year
with 1,338 points.

Head coach Verne Canfield
could not recall the last time
—if there ever was a first time
—that Graves had dunked.

‘You could almost see it com-

ing from halfcourt,”’ said Can-
field. “I think there was a lot of
adrenalin built up for that
play. ”

Baldwin scored six points and
had six assists while running
W&L’s offense. Junior forward
Scott Shannon added 16 points
on eight-for-11 shooting.

The Generals dominated the
team statistics, outrebounding
the Eagles 34-26, outshooting
them from the floor 60 percent
to 49 percent, and outshooting
them from the free throw line 91
‘percent to 56 percent. The
Generals made 23 free throws in
a row during the game,
finishing 30 of 33 from the line.

W&L was never in any real
trouble after taking a halftime
lead of 38-25. Down 17-14 after
seven minutes of play, the
Generals went on a 10-0 streak

to lead 24-17 four minutes later.
Their lead didn’t fall below five
for the rest of the game.

The Jeckyll-and-Hyde
Generals met Lynchburg on
Saturday night in Warner
Center, two weeks after W&L
defeated the Hornets in Lynch-
burg 46-45.

The usually poor free-throw
shooting Hornets shot 21 of 25
from the line while winning
67-59,

Graves again led the Gener-
als, who were 43 percent from
the floor, with 17 points and 10
rebounds.

On Thursday night the
Generals traveled to Emory &
Henry College and came away
with a 74-62 victory.

The Generals shot 67 percent
from the floor and were led by
Graves’ 26 points and Bride-
weser’s six rebounds.

Canfield is hoping to complete
the regular season without los-
ing the Generals’ hold on third
place in the ODAC.

Spring squads travel to Florida

spring athletic teams will be
taking a different sort of break.

The Generals’ baseball and
lacrosse teams will be making
their annual trips to Florida
over the Washington holiday for
a week of practicing and what
both baseball coach Jim Mur-
dock and lacrosse coach Dennis
Daly termed a “coming to-
gether as a team.”

Both teams have worked to
pay the expenses for their trips
south. “Our kids take a lot of
pride in the fact that ‘we work-
ed hard to come here and we’re
going to put it to good use,’ ”
Murdock said of his players.

This year’s trip will be Mur-
dock’s third as the Generals’
coach, and he feels they have
been a large contributing factor
to the team’s play during the
regular season.

“I think a great deal of our
success can be attributed to
Florida. In the past, our first
time outside would be for an ac-
tual game. Now, we can work

on things, and if they make a
mistake, they learn from it, but
there’s no pressure. It builds a
very positive attitude,’ Mur-
dock said.

The baseball squad will have
two practice sessions a day, an
early morning run everyday,
and the opportunity for night
practice sessions. In addition,
on Friday they will play in a
double-header against Eckerd
College. The team will have at
least two free days in Sarasota,
as well as having most of the
evenings off.

Head lax coach Daly, in his
year at the Generals’ helm, sees
three objectives for the team’s
trip to Fort Lauderdale. One is
to gain a sense of team unity,
another is to return from
Florida as better lacrosse
players, and the third is to have
fun.

“Tt expect to accomplish all
three,” Daly said.

The Generals will hold double
practice sessions daily and
scrimmage against various
club teams in the Fort Lauder-
dale area. The club teams are
composed of many ex-college
players, Daly said.

Daly agreed with Murdock
that a major benefit of the trip
would be the weather. “We
can’t stand and teach and go
over things up here because the
guys are just freezing. For that
reason, Florida gives us a
chance to really concentrate
solely on lacrosse. It‘s worth at
least two weeks if not three
weeks of practice up here,’’ he
said.

Daly probably best summed
up the real worth of the break in
this way, “This is one of the
times that the team is really at
the focus, where everyone is
thinking along the same guide-
lines, everyone has the same
frame of reference.

“It really allows a team to get
to know each other, which I
think is a definite plus.”’

By MIKE STACHURA

..AS we head home for a
deserved rest, here are some
Olympic thoughts on the
festival in Sarajevo. I’m begin-
ning to wonder if the Olympics
mean that special something
anymore. Four year’s ago, I
could think of nothing else but
flicking on the talking heads
box and spending umpteen
hours viewing everything from
the biathlon to an update on the
transportation problem in Lake
Placid. This go-round, I’m still
willing to do that, but that ex-
citement seems gone. With the
U.S. and Canada screaming
“Injustice! ’’ about each other’s
hockey teams, various and sun-
dry skiers from tiny European
countries being banned from
the competition, and everything
from instant soup to designer
clothes (Yes, you the American
people can vote for the U.S.A.
wardrobe) being plugged as of-
fical contributors to ‘‘our Olym-
pic effort,”’) the whole concept
seems a bit overdone, leaving
me with more than just your
average bad aftertaste. Does
anybody care to remember
what the Olympics is all about?
Or is it that they’re not willing
to speak up for fear of being
laughed at by those “‘real com-

Grapplers finish with four wins,

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
wrestling team closed out its
regular season with four wins
last week, raising its record to
12-2, its best record in ten years.

Jeff Dixon finished the
regular season with a perfect
record of 19-0, making him the
first W&L wrestler to ac-
complish that feat. Dixon also
established a new W&L mark
for the fastest pin by taking only
10 seconds to defeat his oppo-
nent from Furman.

“I cannot say enough about
what Jeff has meant to this

team, both on and off the mat,”’
said head coach Gary Franke.
“His record is testimony of his
hard work, determination and
his ability. He was also a leader
who helped everyone on the
team this year.’

The Generals defeated
Longwood 33-18 on Wednesday
and won the W&L Quadrangu-
lar meet in a laugher, beating
Lynchburg, 42-11, Furman 540
and LaSalle 37-14.

For the season, six W&L
grapplers with 15 or more deci-
sions have winning records. The
team finished first in the W&L
College Invitational meet and
fourth in the W&L Invitational.

head to Eastern Regionals

The Generals were undefeated
at home, and outpointed their
opponents by a total of 449-163.

“It was a very satisfying
regular season and a very good
week for us,” said Franke. “We
had a lot of wrestlers perform
well, and I feel that we are
peaking at the right time. We
have the Eastern regional
(NCAA Division III at Trenton,
N.J., on Feb. 10-11) coming up
and I hope we continue to do
well.”’

Franke now has 85 career vic-
tories in his 11 years as wres-
tling coach at W&L, making
him the most successful wrestl-
ing coach in the school’s
history.

Booster Club loaned $100

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee Ex-
ecutive Committee has given a
$100 loan to a group of Universi-
ty students interested in form-
ing a Booster Club. Heading the
group is Ed Buttarazzi, a junior
from Auburn, N.Y., who has
promised to pay back the loan
by March 5.

“It’s important to know that
we didn’t allocate any money,”’

said Executive Committee
President Robert Jenevein, who
said that the loan will be used on
a mailing to alumni.

The purpose of the mailing
would be to find out about the
former Assimilation Commit-
tee, which according to a recent
‘Washington Post’’ article
(Jan. 31, 1984) ‘‘disciplined
students who walked on the
grass, failed to greet fellow
students, or were caught
without a necktie,” Jenevein

America” Tuesday, but said,
‘““My feeling and the feeling of
this committee is that further
publicity in this light is
something the students don’t
want. As it stands now, I won’t
do that.

“It’s technically my decision,
and I’m asking the committee
to help me decide...I would not
go under any circumstances if
this school would not benefit.’’

No action was taken on
Pockrass’ petition, but Jene-
vein did not appear on the pro-
gram.

In other action this week: the
EC took less than three minutes
to approve four minor changes
to the open exam proposal,
which now awaits action by the
Faculty Executive Committee

and the faculty as a whole. The
entire faculty is expected to
discuss the issue at its March 5
meeting, and if the proposal is
approved then, it would go into

effect for this semester’s ex-
ams.

Monday’s regular meeting
was postponed until Tuesday
afternoon, at which time the EC
approved the student adviser

system 11-1, with freshman law
representative Steve Grist op-
posed.

Selected by the EC, student

advisers would advise other ~

said that Buttarazzi’s group
merely wants to find out
what made the Assimilation
Committee and its policies a
source of pride to the students,
was quoted in the Post article as
saying, ‘“‘We have no intention _

of going back to an Assimilation
Committee.”

Jenevein does not feel that the
Booster Club would try to in-
stitute an Assimilation Commit-
tee. ‘‘There’s no way anybody
would try that. I think the
Assimilation Committee is out
‘of date here.”’

According to Jenevein, the
Booster Club advocates ap-
proached the EC once they saw
the Committee’s concern about
student apathy. Regardless of
what the Boosters do, Jenevein
has certain goals that he would
like to see met.

These include some way for
all of the students to learn ‘‘The
Washington and Lee Swing,”
the University’s fight song. He
would like to see students take
more pride in W&L’s traditions
and the school’s namesake,
General Robert E. Lee, as well
as gain an understanding of Lee

Lexington, Virginia,

John W. Elrod, chairman of
the department of philosophy at
Iowa State University in Ames,
Iowa, has been named Dean of
the College at Washington and
Lee, effective Aug. 1.

He will succeed William J.
Watt, who announced last
spring that he would be leaving
the post he has held since 1971.

After a year’s leave of
absence, Watt will return full-
time in the fall of 1985 as a
chemistry professor. While he
was dean he taught one course
inthat department.

Elrod, 44, was chosen from
among 200 candidates who were
screened by a nine-member
dean search committee headed
by President John D. Wilson

Read’s drug probe raises questions

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

At least 13 Washington and Lee students
have been subpoenaed by the special grand
jury investigating drug trafficking in Lex-
ington and Rockbridge County.

Several of the students were scheduled to
testify this morning at the 16th session of the
panel, which has become the focus of increas-
ing local controversy.

The special grand jury was impaneled Oct.
24 by Circuit Court Judge George E. Honts III
at the request of Commonwealth’s Attorney
Beverly C. ‘‘John” Read.

It cannot issue indictments, but instead can
make recommendations to the regular grand
jury through Read.

W&L Dean of Students Lewis G. John said
he’s ‘‘talked with a number of students
who’ ve expressed a variety of concerns about
the investigation.

‘It’s not only students who are expressing
concern about it, but also others in the com-
munity,” he said.

Dean John said he is uncertain exactly what
effect the special grand jury has had on drug

use at Washington and Lee.

‘‘Kither the use and sale of drugs is not so
widespread as it was, or it has been driven
underground. I sense that one of the two is oc-
curring,’’ he said.

‘Some students have told me that they feel
there is significantly less use than there was a
year ago, and that’s primarily because of the
investigation,’ he continued.

Clerk of Circuit Court Bruce Patterson said
that the regular grand jury is next scheduled
to meet on May 7.

‘‘T’m not sure, but I think they plan on being
through before the next grand jury meeting,”’
Patterson said.

A special grand jury normally operates for
a maximum of six months, but state law pro-
vides that the court may make an extension if
it ‘‘determines that the special grand jury i
making progress in its investigation.”’

‘‘Any extension has to be justified,’’ Judge
Honts said. ‘If they present such justifica-
tion, and it is in the best interest of the com-
munity to extend it, then I would doso.”’

The nine jurors have heard testimony from
at least 121 witnesses. In addition, a number
of juveniles have been called. Their names

were not released.

Read said he is continuing his policy of not
commenting on any aspect of the investiga-
tion until it is completed.

In interviews, many local lawyers express-
ed disagreement with the tactics and scope of
the investigation.

‘‘T’ve heard a number of complaints from
attorneys,”’ said J. Todd Jones, president of
the Lexington-Buena Vista Bar Association.

A lawyer who asked not to be identified con-
firmed that he and 13 other local attorneys
met at the Green Valley Restaurant outside
Lexington on Feb. 9 and discussed the in-
vestigation.

Jones would not comment on whether he at-
tended the meeting.

He said that the bar association had taken
no official action, and that no formal action
had been requested.

“I think the system is being abused,”’ said
James T. Adams, a lawyer who ran against
Read for Commonwealth’s Attorney last
year.

“In a grand jury situation, you can ask
questions you couldn't ask in a courtroom

Successor to Watt
named by trustees

had two books on that subject
published by the Princeton
University Press.

The dean-elect was unavaila-
ble for an interview this week.

Last February at Washington
and Lee, Elrod presented a
series of lectures for the depart-
ment of religion.

One of the presentations was
called ‘Einstein and God,” an
examination of Albert Eins
tein’s scientific and religious
ideas, which Elrod developed in
conjunction with an Iowa State
physicist

Watt met Elrod when he was
in Lexington last year

“T thought he was very nice
and I enjoyed meeting his wife
as well,”’ Watt said.

‘‘He seemed like a person wh«
would be very easy to get along
with. He seemed quite friendly
and very open. I enjoyed
meeting him.’

Watt said he decided to give
up his office because he’d been
in it so long. ‘I’ve been here 12
years — you can’t last forever,”
he said.

He also said that this was a
good time for a change because
there is a new president. He
said he had been in office for a
year and a half transition peri-
od, and now it was possible
for President Wilson to bring in
a new dean of the college.

Referring to their respective
specialties, Watt said he’d told
Elrod that in his office ‘there
are chemical problems and
there are philosophical pro-
blems — I’ll leave you all the
philosophical ones.”

Elrod, a native of Griffin,
Ga., studied at Presbyterian
College before getting his
master’s and doctorate degrees
from Columbia University.

He was a lecturer in the
philosophy of religion at Union
Theological Seminary in New
York before joining the lowa
State University philosophy
department in 1971

Review and Outlook

 

‘Yes’ for open exams

After what seemed to be an interminable number of
delays, the Faculty Executive Committee finally ap-
proved the long-awaited open exam policy this week.
If the faculty as a whole approves the proposal March
5, students will be free from the constraints of having
to inform their professors when they intend to take
theirexams. |

One of this university’s major attractions is its
honor system founded in the traditions of Robert E.
Lee. The fact that students already can choose par-
ticular times to take exams is a convenient feature of
our honor system.

Under the proposal passed by the Faculty EC,
students can take their exams at either 9 a.m. or 2
p.m. any day of the exam week. They do not need to
indicate an exam time on their envelopes, although
they must turn in envelopes to the professors with just
their name and course on them.

While this would, indeed, make things easier for
students, there are other benefits.

The exam procedure would be standardized
throughout the school. Many religion students
already operate under the open exam rules. In the
Commerce School, though, students usually have dif-
ficulty changing the time of their exam once they’ve
turned in their envelopes.

Most other departments fall somewhere between
the two extremes, creating nothing but confusion.

The open exam policy would alleviate most of that
confusion, and the student Executive Committee’s
volunteering of student help to distribute exams in the
Commerce School and the history department should
qualm any fears faculty may have about the pro-
posal’s creating too much work for secretaries or pro-
fessors.

The faculty recently has been accused of not follow-
ing the wishes of the student body. It will have the op-
portunity a week from Monday to stem that tide of
criticism while at the same time broadening the ap-
plication of our honor system.

Tie issue : distraction from introspection

To the Editors:

Congratulations, gentlemen,
you’ve made national news
again. While driving through
Washington today, a radio com-
mentator’s lead line caught my
attention. For a_ nationally
disseminated network feature,
he began by suggesting that a
rebellion was near critical mass
at one of America’s colleges.
Somehow I guessed that W&L
was to be named, so I listened
closely through three adver-
tisements, distressed that our
coeducation crises was about to
be aired to the nation.

But no — it was an impending
riot concerning the wearing of
coats and ties at that same
venerable institution that had
the broadcaster agog. He also
found piquant a seeming role
reversal — students wishing a

. dress code while an unnamed

faculty member snorted,
‘‘Medieval!”’ The commentator
was pro, suggesting that dress-
ing like gentlemen would en-
courage acting like gentlemen.
The wording reminded me of
Saint Bob’s profundity, “‘We
have but one rule here...” I was

also interested because my
time in Lexington was also one
of relative upheaval. While we
were not exactly a hotbed of
SDS activity, classes were
disrupted. However, I recall
that even then, and even the
most intensely committed,
Washington and Lee students
were judicious in attempting to
influence their peers. Everyone
seemed to realize that no strike,
no picket line could reasonably
be expected to delay those of us
who, for example, had to get to
Organic lab. Keith Shillington
awaited with tech points in
hand; the age of Aquarius
would simply have to defer
dawning.

Imposing our own ideas of
propriety on others can be tir-
ing and time consuming, but it
provides a wonderful distrac-
tion from introspection. When
resisted, should not he who
seeks to control ask if the
necessity is so great, if the
result is so desirable, as to war-
rant even a little lessening of
liberty or free expression.

I hope all the combatants in
this great clash of principles
can enjoy the conflict, bemused
by the realization that none of it
will matter a whit in five or ten
years, regardless. Now coedu-
cation, on the other hand...

Hugh F. Hill III
Class of 1971

CPR course to be offered

To the Editors:

Once again our Athletic
Department in conjunction with
the American Red Cross will
sponsor a module CPR Course
available for administration,
faculty, staff, and students.
Classes will be conducted from
7 to 9 p.m. Monday through

Ties, ties, ties, more ties

To the Editors:

I was outraged to hear of the
Executive Committee’s vote to
ask the faculty to require
students to wear ‘respectable
clothes, including ties,” to
classes. The whole idea is
ludicrous. We pay almost
$10,000 a year to come here to

learn, not to be subjected to pet-
ty regulations affecting our ap-
pearance. I had to wear a coat
and tie for school since sixth
grade, and I looked forward to
college and its intellectual pur-
suits which were free of such
petty rules.

That's not the most important
point, though. The EC is suppos-
ed to be a representative body.

Yet the student body was never
consulted on the matter of dress
and appearance. Also, isn’t the
issue of the open exam policy
more important than how we
look? I find it hard to believe
that the EC can vote on clothing
regulations, yet continued to
delay its decision on the open
exam policy which is one of the
most important aspects of our
honor system.

The Executive Committee
seems to have forgotten that
Washington and Lee is a univer-
sity, not a finishing school. We
are here to learn to think for
ourselves, not to have our way
of life dictated tous.

Faculty EC approves open exam proposal

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

The Faculty Executive Com-
mittee approved the proposed
open exam policy 8-2 Monday,
junior representative Cole
Dawson reported at Monday
evening’s. Student Executive
Committee meeting.

The faculty as a whole will
debate the proposal and pro-
bably vote on it at its regular
meeting March 5. If approved
the open exam proposal would
go into effect for this semester’s
exams.

As approved by the Faculty
EC, the open exam policy would
allow a student to take an exam
at any time during the final
week of the term. The student
would not have to decide in ad-
vance when he would take his
exam.

The student EC must supply
three students to help distribute
exams in the Commerce School

Mock Con

Robb, Sen.

By JOHN WILTSE
Mock Convention
Correspondent

The ‘“‘call for delegates” of-
ficially has been made by the
organizers of Washington and
Lee’s Mock Democratic Con-
vention and 24 state delegations
‘still have openings.

Nearly the . entire
undergraduate student body
will be needed to participate as
delegates during the convention
to be held May 11 and 12.

The Mock Convention staff

held Delegate Sign-up Night

Jan. 23, in Evans Dining Hall .

with a rather low student turn-
out. The chairmen of the 50
state delegations recruited
students for their delegations
and answered any questions
students might have.

Pete Muller, Mock Conven-
tion co-chairman, said students
will be given another opportuni-
ty to sign-up “in the near
future.’”” Anyone who hasn’t
joined a delegation can leave

and one or two for the history
department. These students
would be appointed from among
all elected student officers.

-The EC also announced that
petitions for candidates for the
Big Three — president, vice
president and secretary — are
due in the EC room Monday at 7
p.m.

A forum among the can-
didates is scheduled Wednes-
day, Feb. 29, at 4 p.m. in Room
327 of the Commerce School and
elections will be the following
Monday, March5.

Also Monday night, the EC
debated, but took no action on,
whether to continue to support
using student body funds for
construction of the student ac-
tivities pavilion in light of a re-
cent vote by the House of
Delegates of the Virginia
General Assembly to raise the
drinking age to21.

To become law, that proposal
still must be approved by the

Virginia Senate.

‘Burford Smith, co-chairman
of the Student Activities Board,
and John Haywood, treasurer,
said raising the drinking age
wouldn’t hurt pavilion func-
tions.

“It would make the use of the
building more attractive and
probably a little more often
because everyone would be in
the same situation,’ Smith
said.

Haywood warned, though,
that if the bill passed, no beer
would be sold at the pavilion.
Because of problems with li-
censing and with getting
students over 21 to serve the
beer, ‘‘we cannot provide beer
for a handful of students and
control it,’” Haywood said.

“] think trying to second-
guess the government just belit-
tles the whole idea of the
pavilion,” freshman represen-
tative Andrew Caruthers said.

The EC did approve an expen-

delegate slots open;
Randolph to speak

his name at the Mock Conven-
tion office in the University
Center, he added.

The primary responsibilities
of a delegate will fall on the
weekend of the convention,
Muller said. Delegates con-
struct their state’s float for the
convention parade and are ex-
pected to be present at all ses-
sions of the convention.

Pending faculty approval,
classes will be canceled on the
opening day of the Mock Con-
vention, Friday, May 11, in
order to allow students to view
the parade and participate in
the opening session.

In addition, delegates are
responsible for keeping inform-
ed of major campaign develop-
ments in their states. Delegates
also will have the opportunity to
participate in various social
events sponsored by their state
prior to the convention.

“Each delegate can have as
much initiative as he wants or
as little initiative as he wants,”’
Muller said. During the conven-

Public hearing tomorrow
on proposed beer bill

A committee of the Virginia
Senate has scheduied a public
hearing tomorrow morning to
debate whether the legal age for
buying beer should be raised
from 19 to21.

The Virginia House of
Delegates approved the bill,
sponsored by Del. Frank D.
Hargrove, R-Hanover, Feb. 14
by a 58-39 vote.

The Senate Rehabilitation
and Social Services Committee
will consider the bill at 9 a.m.
tomorrow, according to a clerk

for the committee.

The Senate Courts and
Justice Committee rejected a
similar bill 10-7 last month.

As passed by the House, the
bill contains a “grandfather
clause’’ that would allow people
who have turned 19 by July 1 to
continue to buy beer.

The House of Delegates pass-
ed a similar bill last year but
had to settle for only raising the
age for purchasing beer to 19
from 18 when the Senate balked
at raising the age to 21.

uon sessions, he said, a del-
egate’s activity can range from
giving input to the platform
debate to discussing ideological
preferences within his delega-
tion in choosing a nominee.

“The delegates compose the
foundation of decision-making,
which ultimately leads to the
correct presidential nominee,”
Muller said.

In related Mock Convention
news, two speakers have been
announced.

Sen. Jennings Randolph, D-
W.Va., will deliver the platform
address, which will be followed
by the platform debate May 11.

Randolph was first elected to
the House of Representatives in

1932 with the Franklin Roose-

velt administration. Defeated
in 1946, he entered the private
sector and then was elected to
the Senate in 1958. He is
presently the ranking minority
member of the Senate Environ-
ment and Public Works Com-
mittee and a member of the
Labor and Human Resources
Committee and the Committee
on Veterans’ Affairs.

During his 40-year career
as a legislator, Randolph
has been a champion of a
nationwide _ transportation
system and the rights of the
handicapped. The 81-year-old
Randolph announced his retire-
ment from the Senate last year.

Virginia Governor Charles S.
Robb will deliver the introduc-
tory address to the Mock Con-
vention. Robb, who received his
law degree in 1973 from the
University of Virginia, served
as Lieutenant Governor of
Virginia from 1977 to 1981.

W&L President John D.
Wilson and Lexington Mayor
Charles Phillips, an economics
professor, will also be address-
ing the convention.

IFC approves

By PETER WRIGHT
Staff Reporter

The Interfraternity Council
recently unanimously approved
a 1984-85 budget of over $18,000,
and IFC President Emery Ell-
inger said no major changes
were made as compared to last
year’s appropriations.

The largest allotment of the
budget, drafted by IFC
treasurer Willie Wilson, went to
Contact ’84, which received
$7,500 the same amount it
received last year. Never-
theless, Ellinger expressed his
disappointment that Contact
did not publicize the fact that it
is sponsored by the IFC as well
as the Executive Committee.

“The budget was, overall,
non-controversial other than
that Contact part,” Ellinger
said.

In addition to the Contact ap-
propriation, $5,650 was set aside
to pay for the room and board of
two exchange students spon-
sored by the IFC. Although one
of these students plans to
graduate at the end of this
school year, Ellinger said a new
exchange student would be
recruited.

Other expenditures noted in
the budget include $1,663 for a
Rush book, $2,500 for a fraterni-
ty spring weekend and $700 for
miscellaneous expenses, in-
cluding donations to charities
and payments to workers for
picking up trash near frater-
‘nities, Ellinger said.

$100 loan

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

A $100 loan was returned
unused to the Washington and
Lee Executive Committee Mon-
day night by junior Ed But-
tarazzi. The loan, meant to help
finance a Booster Club, was to
have been repaid March 5.

According to Buttarazzi, the
project was stopped because of
a lack of expected support from
would-be supporters. The $100
was to have financed a mailing

$18,000 budget

Ellinger noted that the IFC
sponsored the annual Christ-
mas parade in Lexington last
December, paid for one of the
bands that performed at the
Muscular Dystrophy Super-
dance and plans to donate near-
ly $350 to the World Hunger
Organization.

Ellinger added that some of
the miscellaneous expenses are
used in the day-to-day operation
of the IFC and that any money
left over from the budget would
be donated to charitable
organizations.

According to the budget
report, the IFC expects to earn

$4,950 from the students who
pay the $15 fee to participate in

Rush activities. In addition, Ell-
inger said, the IFC should ob-
tain about $600 from fraternities

fined for misconduct.

Overall, the IFC needs to
raise $12,463 to break even.
Each fraternity member thus is
required to pay about $15 of the
IFC budget. These payments
are collected by the respective
fraternities. The first payment
is due at the end of March, with
the other due in late April.

In other fraternity news, elec-
tions for IFC President and
Vice president will be held
March 5. Nominations for the
senior and junior justices,

to alumni, which Buttarazzi
hoped would generate income.
This, in turn, would have been
used to repay the loan and spon-
sor publicity of university ac-
tivities, so some might not have
considered it a true booster
club.

“It (the name - Booster Club)
was a name for lack of a better
name,” said Buttarazzi, who
does not foresee making
another attempt at the project
in the near future.

Poll shows 1983 grads doing well

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

Only 6.4 percent of
Washington and Lee’s Class of
1983 that participated in a re-
cent poll had not entered
graduate school or found a job
by October, according to a
report prepared by the place-
ment office.

The report is based on the
returns from a questionnaire
mailed to all 276 members of the
Class of 1983 who graduated in
June. More than 82 percent of
the 1983 graduates responded to
the survey.

The report notes that 31.2 per-
cent of the W&L graduates went
on to graduate or professional
school, and 60.6 percent found
jobs. Most of those graduates
_who remained unemployed in

~ October indicated that they had
just recently begun to look for a
job, the report said.

“It is concluded from this
finding that unemployement af-
fects only an_ insignificant
number of recent W&L stu-
dents.

“I am now seeing a high de-
mand in almost every forsee-
able job market,” Cappetto
said.

Not only did the 1983 W&L
graduates do fairly well in ob-

taining jobs, but the survey in-

 

   

dicates that most graduates
found jobs that satisfied them.

Almost 88 percent of the
respondents said that their jobs
required a college degree. In
1980, 92 percent of the graduates
reported that their jobs re-
quired a college diploma.

In addition, 85.7 percent of the
respondents said they were
satisfied with the type of work
they were doing, and 77 percent
of the respondents said their job
was consistent with their long-
term career goals.

Graduates in the humanities
had the lowest percentage — 70
percent — of individuals who
believed their job required a
college degree. In 1980,
however, more than 92 percent
of humanities graduates said
their job required a college
degree.

“‘It goes up and down, but I’m
not discouraged by that,” Cap-
petto said.

Cappetto said some of the
people who reported that their
job did not require a college
education, based on the job’s
challenge, probably would not
have gotten the job if they did
not have a college degree.

Merchandising and sales was
the most popular occupation
among 1983 W&L graduates, ac-

cording to the report. Banking |

and finance, real estate and the

military were also popular
career choices for 1983 W&L
graduates.

Occupations that saw major
declines in popularity among
W&L graduates were educa-
tion, government work and
social work and counseling.

Starting salaries for 1983
W&L graduates tended to be
below the national mean
salaries for 1983 graduates, the
report indicated. The median
salary of the 1983 W&L
graduates was $15,000-$16,999,
according to the report.

Business graduates had the
highest median salaries and
journalism and humanities
graduates had the lowest me-
dian salaries.

A possible explanation of the
below average starting salaries
for W&L graduates is that many
W&L students took jobs in the
Southeast, Cappetto said.
Salaries tend to be higher on
average in the Northeast
because the cost of living also is
higher, asserted Cappetto.

Cappetto emphasized that
salary should not be the only
factor a student considers when
looking for a job. People should
find jobs they enjoy, Cappetto
said.

“T would never want a W&L
student to pick a major because
he thinks it’s marketable. Find

work that you regard as en-
joyable,” said Cappetto.

Of the more than 30 percent of
W&L graduates who went on to
graduate work, the most
noticeable decline was among
students going to law school.
Only 11.5 percent of 1983 W&L
graduates, the lowest percent-
age for any year that data was
collected, went to law school.
Fourteen percent of 1980 W&L
graduates went to law school.

“For many years a bright stu-
dent from W&L found it easier
to get into grad school than it
was to get a job. The job market
is improving, and it’s not easier
to get into grad school than it is
to get a job,” Cappetto said.

This year, however, Cappetto
said law schools are reporting a
20-30 percent drop in applica-
tions nationally.

“It’s going to be much easier
to get into law or business
schools. The message to
everyone who is applying to
graduate school is that you
should apply to at least one
place you think is over your
head,”’ advised Capetto.

While law school applicants
from W&L declined in 1983, the
number of W&L graduates go-
ing to medical school increased.
Seven percent of W&L gradu-
ates went to medical school in
1983 as compared to 3 percent of
1980 graduates.

An additional 3 percent of
W&L graduates in 1983 went to
business school and the remain-
ing 8 percent went into a variety
of graduate programs ranging
from aviation to nuclear
engineering.

Former student convicted

A former Washington and Lee
student was found guilty of
possession of cocaine Feb. 6 in
Rockbridge County Circuit
Court and was given a suspend-
ed five-year sentence.

Charles M. Phillips, of Mont-
clair, N.J., pleaded guilty to the
charge, which was placed Feb.
4, 1983, after 27.88 grams of co-
caine were found in his posse-
sion.

WGL

According to evidence
presented by Virginia State
Trooper Wayne Oyler, the co-
caine discovered was 33 percent

pure.

Phillips withdrew from the
University following the 1982-83
academic year.

Circuit Court Judge George
A. Honts III heard the evidence
and pronounced both the ver-
dict and the sentence.

Footloose ain ’t Flashdance

By CHARLIE ALCORN
Staff Reporter

Question? What is the first
thing you think of when you
hear the word ‘Footloose?’
“Flashdance,” right? Well so
much for word association
because that is about all the two
movies have incommon.

Yes, ‘Footloose’ does have
the obligatory dance numbers
that are as slickly choreograph-
ed and performed as those in
‘“‘Flashdance’” but did you ever
give a serious thought as to the
validity of a female-steelworker
turned stripper in Pittsburgh?
No, neither did I, but it sure
looked good.

The problem with ‘“Foot-
loose’’ is that it tried too hard.
Tackling real problematic
themes such as why people
can’t dance in the corn belt and
whether- ‘Slaughterhouse
Five’’ is a classic in Beaumont,
Iowa. It’s the kind of stuff that
Jerry Falwell could work up a
sweat over, but it left most
wishing that they would just put
on their dancing shoes.

There are, however, some
fine performances by a cast
which is shackled by a screen-
play that might enthrall a
sociologist but left much of the
’ audience trudging up for pop-
corn during the lengthy breaks
in action.

Ren (Kevin Bacon) is the
rebel with a cause. Bacon car-
ries off this Chicago punk
routine well and gets great sup-
port from his redneck pal
Willard (Christopher Penn)
who turns out to be the Michael
Jackson of the International

Harvester set.

The femme fatale is a
preacher’s daughter who is
leaning more toward the devil.
Ariel (Lori Singer) is a tempt-
ing young lass and Miss Singer
fits the character mold like the
skin tight denims she wears.
The Rev. Shaw Moore (John
Lithgow) rants and raves
against the heathen disco infer-
no that threatens to turn his
Sunday services into Dance

Fever, but his is no match for
the all powerful ‘‘movie sound-
track” (hail, oh great Kenny
Loggins) At least the Reverend
was a good sport.

So, my advice to the W&L
moviegoer: Go on and see the
movie. You could do much
worse, just don’t expect to find
yourself jumping to break
dance in the aisles when the
credits roll up.

Choosing among

Lex ’s finest fowl

By EDDIE CURRAN
Staff Reporter

Before discussing what Lex-
ington has to offer in the way of
fried chicken to go I’m going to
take a second to explain the pur-
pose of this new column, the Eat
Beat. (Credit for the name Eat
Beat goes to consultant and

ee
Eat Beat

fellow chow hound, Doug
Teague). Pure and simple, it’s a
consumer guide, and, if I do my
job and you pay attention, then
just maybe you can avoid some
of the needless mistakes which
too often befall the consumer
who, with a couple of bucks in
his pocket and an empty
stomach, is hungry for some-
thing but he doesn’t know exact-
ly what for. This column is aim-
ed especially at late Sunday

afternoons; that time beginning
just after the sports ends and
before the Sunday might movie
begins. Too often there is
hesitation and the next thing
you know the movie’s on so you
settle for dialing the inevitable
7375 for Domino’s. But if you
make your move quickly and
smartly, you can add variety to
your eating life without cussing
yourself after it’s too late
because you wasted your Sun-
day dinner on basic Domino’s
filler.

So where in Lexington do you
go if you have a craving for
fried chicken, and you don’t
have time to drive all the way to
Westmorelands, or spend 30
minutes and six bucks in a
restaurant? You have four
choices: Kentucky Fried
Chicken, Kenney’s, Kroger and
Safeway. Unfortunately,
neither of these places offers a
truly transcendental fried
chicken eating experience, the

‘Scenes from a Marriage’
to be screened this weekend

The Washington and Lee Film
Society will present ‘Scenes
from a Marriage’ (Sweden,
1974), directed by Ingmar
Bergman, at 8 p.m. on Friday,
Feb. 24 and Saturday, Feb. 25.
Showings will be in Classroom
“A” of Lewis Hall in the W&L
Law School. There is no charge
for admission and the public is
invited. The film is in Swedish,
with English subtitles.

Director Bergman is, of
course, one of the greatest film
makers of all time. His films
have dealt powerfully with per-
sonal, introspective themes
—loneliness, alienation, psycho-
sexuality, family relationships.
Though “Scenes from a Mar-
riage” continues Bergman’s in-
terest in intimate themes, the

film is something of a stylistic
departure from most of his
earlier works; utilizing an
unusually straightforward and
explicit manner, the film
reflects its origins as a Swedish
television series.

“Scenes from a Marriage’
does not have a particularly ex-
traordinary plot or theme; the
film explores the relationship
between a husband and his wife.
However, it has been hailed for
its unusual frankness, in-
telligence and sensitivity in
dealing with the very intimate
events which may color a rela-
tionship. Critic Roger Ebert has
described ‘“‘Scenes” as ‘one of
the truest, most luminous love
stories ever made, an almost
heart-breaking masterpiece.”’

Cagers fall in first round

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
basketball team lost three of its
last four regular-season games,
then suffered a 65-60 overtime
loss to Lynchburg College Tues-
day night in the opening round
of the ODAC tournament at
Warner Center.

The Generals began the week
of February break by losing at
Roanoke College, 66-62, Satur-
day night. Senior forward John
Lee Graves led the Generals
with 24 points.

Tuesday night W&L traveled
to Eastern Mennonite College to
face a team that finished
seventh out of nine teams in the
ODAC and that the Generals

to Maryville College, a team
they had beaten by 13 points
here earlier in the season, and
lost by eight points, 72-64, for
their third straight road defeat.
Junior forward Scott Shannon,
the team’s second-leading re-
bounder and third-leading
scorer, injured his ankle and
missed the last ten minutes of
the game.

Finally, the team traveled to
Hampden-Sydney for the final
regular-season game. Playing
without Shannon, the Generals
were victorious, 55-48.

The difference in_ the
Hampden-Sydney game was
that the Generals played
defense as they were supposed
to, said head coach Verne Can-
field.

final regular-season record of
14-11 overall and 9-7 in the con-
ference. Catholic and Lynch-
burg both also had 9-7 ODAC
records. The tie-breaking pro-
cedure placed Catholic third,
W&L fourth and Lynchburg
fifth, which meant that the
Generals would host Lynchburg
Tuesday night in the quarter-
final round of the tournament.

W&L beat Lynchburg, 46-45,
in the teams’ first meeting on
Jan. 21 but lost, 67-59, when the
Hornets came to Lexington
Feb.4.

The Generals opened the
game with the spark that seems
to have been lacking in some of
their recent games. Starting off

with 10 unanswered points, the
Generals built their lead to 24-10
with 10 minutes left in the first
half on 10 of 16 shooting.

Then they fell apart. W&L
managed only three points (a
three-point play by Kevin Mc-
Clatchey) in the last 10 minutes
of the half, while shooting one
for five from the floor and com-
mitting five turnovers.

The Hornets took advantage
of W&L’s collapse by making 7
of 10 field goals and tying the
game at halftime, 27-27. -

The second half was fairly
even, as reflected in the score at
the end of it: 49-49. The Hornets
shot 46 percent from the floor
(11 of 24) to the Generals 42 per-

cent (13 of 31).

In the overtime period W&L
fell apart again. Lynchburg
took a 51-50 lead, then went ona
7-0 spurt.

At the end of that spurt, with
one minute left, W&L down
58-50 and his college basketball
career effectively over, Graves
committed his fifth and final
foul. As he walked to the bench
the crowd gave him a standing
ovation. His 519 points this
season (20.0 points per game)
leave him seventh on the all-
time scoring list at W&L, with
1,441.

The Generals shot 3 of 11 from
the floor in the overtime period
and fell, 65-60.

The Generals’ overall record
of 14-12 is the team’s worst since
the 1979-80 season, when the
team went 14-15, but won the
ODAC tournament.

The Washington and Lee
wrestling team made its best
showing in recent years at the
NCAA Division III Eastern
Regional meet in Trenton, N.J.,
on Feb. 11-12.

The tournament featured the
top wrestlers from 25 schools in
the Eastern region.

The Generals entered six
wrestlers in the championships,

. andall performed well.

Tim Valliere (167 lbs.), Joe
O’Neill (177 Ibs.) and Jeff Dixon
(190 Ibs.) all captured fourth-
place finishes, falling only one
victory short of qualifying for
the national tournament.

Dixon came painfully close to
qualifying, being eliminated by
only one point in overtime in his
final bout.

Larry Anker (142 lbs.) and
Carlton Peebles (HWT) both
finished fifth in their respective
weight classes.

Brian Lifsted (118 lbs.) won
one match, but was eliminated
by the eventual winner of his
weight class.

The Generals finished the
season witha record of 12-2. The
team won one tournament dur-
ing the year and finished fourth
in the tough W&L Invitational
meet. With the loss of only two
seniors from the 1983-84 team,
W&L wrestling will return eight
of ten starters for the 1984-85
edition.

....Well, back from a week’s
hiatus and it’s time for a review
of that ABC miniseries ‘‘Sara-
jevo.”” A good 80 percent of the
production rivaled “Winds of
Bore (er, War)’’ for excitement
and equaled at times that series
in sports content. Anticlimactic
perhaps best sums up this XIV
winter meeting of the world’s
cold weather athletes.
Everytime the activity in Sara-
jevo got mildly interesting,
ABC decided to put the sports
on hold and give us some
brilliant fluff piece on the
fascinating coffee shop nestled
in the hills overlooking the
Olympic city. And who can
forget the new and improved
“Up Close and Personal”
segments. The Russian speed-
skater playing his guitar made
me actually wish for John
Denver. One wonders, though,
just how exciting any Winter
Olympics can be. Seriously,
there’s cross country skiing and
the biathlon which remind one
of chores more than athletic
contests. As well, ABC’s
coverage did leave me with a
few questions. First, where did
they get those blazers? Glow-in-
the-dark light blue? C’mon Jim.
Did we really need those Ray
Gandolph reports? Nothing per-
sonal, Ray, but the Olympics
means sports or sports-related
not the story of three sisters
who make rugs the old-
fashioned way. Sarajevo is a
wonderfully obscure eastern
European city, or rather
wonderful because it is obscure.
Now that the ABC trucks and
cameras have exposed every
nook and cranny of the Olympic
city, it seems as attractive a
place as...well, Harrisburg, Pa.
All this aside, ABC’s hype could
not take away from the ath-
letes’ special moments. There

as tacky a fashion as possible),
and Bill Johnson, perhaps the
most realistic and fun athlete at
the games (No cute, mean-
ingless phrases, just straight
and to the point: What does this
mean to you, Bill? Millions!).

The Washington and Lee
swimming team lost a dual
meet to Virginia Common-
wealth University in the final
event of the day on Feb. 10 at
Sweet Briar College.

Head swimming coach Page
Remillard is pleased that his
Division III team was very
competitive against the Divi-
sion I program of VCU. Com-
menting on the meet, Remillard
said, ‘‘We took them to the free
relay. It was something a lot of
other teams couldn’t do.”’

The Generals finished their
dual meet schedule with a
record of 6-4. W&L is currently
ranked 6th in the country
among Division II swim teams.

Last weekend the Generals
participated in the Seahawk In-
vitational at UNC Wilmington.
W&L was the only Division III
team at the meet which Coach
Remillard described as ‘‘very,
very fast.”

W&L now has qualified swim-

mers in 10 events for the NCAA

cording to Coach Remillard,
that figure represents the most
events that the Generals have
qualified for the nationals.
‘ This weekend the Generals
will swim at the Virginia Senior
Championships at Virginia

“That’s our big meet,” said
Remillard. Because the Gener-
als do not compete in a confer-
ence, Remillard believes the
meet is important to the W&L
swim program as the final
regular event of the season.
Remillard also said, ‘‘There
will be team rankings there that
we can compete with.”’

Several Generals are swim-
ming times that are very close
to the national qualifying time
in their events and may qualify
this weekend. For example, the
400 medley relay team is .05 of a
second off the national cut-off
time. Remillard said, ‘‘A couple
of guys will hit their taper this
weekend, and I expect a couple
of them to qualify.”

McDonald’s to open in August

Construction to begin in April in Maxway Shopping Center

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

Burger battles soon may
make their way to the city of
Lexington. A Waynesboro cor-
poration recently leased a
building on U.S. 60 in Lexington
that it plans to convert into a
McDonald’s restaurant by fall.

“It’s fairly definite,” said
R.A. Hendricks, founder and
president of RAHE Inc., con-
cerning the construction of the
fast food restaurant on the end
of the Maxway Shopping center
(across from Safeway Super-
market) in a building that
formerly housed Sears Roebuck
Inc. Construction should begin
in April, according to Hen-
dricks, with opening day
targeted for the last week in
August.

At first, it seemed ques-

 

tionable whether there would be
enough room for parking and a
drive-thru. ‘‘The architects just
gave us some drawings.’’ said
Hendricks, who noted that there
will be 82 parking spaces and a
drive-thru. To accomplish this,
the shopping center’s driveway
will be widened, with drive-thru
customers traveling toward the
Maxway before making a U-
turn to the drive-thru window.

‘Route 60 is the main artery
for the town of Lexington,’’ said
Hendricks, who added that
W&L, Virginia Military In-
stitute and Lexington, ‘‘shop-
ping hub for the Rockbridge
County,” were all factors that
influenced his decision to locate
the McDonalds’s in Lexington.
“The trading area would sup-
porta McDonald’s,”’ he said,
adding that the closest
McDonald’s locations are in

terms the hours ‘‘flexible.”’

to 11 p.m., seven days a week,
with the possibility of longer

‘“‘We’re looking forward to go-

business is an _ independent
licensee of 16 McDonald’s
restaurants.

situation,’ he said. “To me,
that’s the most significant
thing, and I think John is taking
advantage of it.

“If you’re going to charge
people with something, then
charge them. But this grand
jury is an abuse of public
responsibility,’ he said.

Larry Mann, another at-

'| torney in the field of four seek-

ing the prosecutor’s post last

-fall, also finds fault with the in-

vestigation.

“There’s no question in my
mind that the process is having
a negative impact on this com-
munity,’ he said.

“Part of the problem is the
use of the subpoena power to

compel people to answer ques-
tions that might be answered
voluntarily.”

Bernard J. Natkin, who has
practiced law in Lexington
since 1950, takes a different
view. “John Read got the ap-
proval of the Circuit Court to
have a grand jury, and until we
see the results of it, we should
reserve judgment,”’ he said.

“Tf it’s not worthwhile, he will
be responsible to the electorate.
If the results justify the means,
he shouldn’t be criticized,”
Natkin said. !

Lexington Police Chief L.O.
Sutton joined Read and
Rockbridge County Sheriff S.M.
Reynolds in requesting the
special grand jury.

two choices, either the famous
“regular recipe,’’ or the newer
“extra-crispy recipe.’’ While
I’m the type who likes his
chicken crispy, the nod here
goes to the regular recipe, no
contest. Extra-crispy at KFC is
crispy, but it must lack at least
nine of the Colonels’ 11 secret
herbs and spices. It’s dry and
virtually tasteless — you’ll have

to add salt and that’s bad on the
conscience. Yet the regular
recipe, though hardly great
fried chicken, is the best take-
out in Lexington. The 11 herbs
and spices make a tasty batter,
and it’s a bit more moist than
the extra-crispy, though still not
as moist as it should be. Yet my
main objection with KFC is on
ethical grounds, rather than on
purely culinary grounds; when
they cut up the chicken, they
come up with three breasts —
two side breasts and a center

breast —rather than the two

you would expect. So rather
than getting ‘‘a breast’ like you
ordered, you get two-thirds of a
breast, which looks little more
than bite-size, and represents
something of a rip-off.

Next week I’ll wind up the

fried chicken review, with the
three lesser known spots, Ken-
ney’s, Kroger and Safeway.

A walk through the Cities of Gold

By JOHN HAYWOOD
Summer Intern

The towering search light
beams will once again be cir-
cling high above Warner Center
announcing the 77th annual
Fancy Dress Ball on Friday,
March 2. The theme of this
year’s Ball, Lost Cities of Gold,
will take students and alumni
back to the wild and mystical
South American civilizations of
the fifteenth century.

The Student Activities Board,
with a budget of $70,000 and a
staff of 50, has spared no effort
in transforming Warner Center
into a panorama of Aztec,
Mayan and Incan cities and
festivals. This year’s decora-
tions are the most expensive
and spectacular in the Ball’s 77-
year history.

Mr. F.D. Arrives

ing to the entrance,

Mr. F.D. and his date will climb
along the falls of the Urubamba
river towards Lake Titicaca in
the Andes mountains of Peru.
Ancient myth claims that this is
where the Sun God created the
first Incan, Monco Capac.
Vegetation covers the rocky ter-
rain to the top of the waterfalls,
but a path has been carefully il-
luminated to lead Mr. F.D.
toward the ancient cities
beyond.

Gulf of Campeche

Passing through the en-
trance, Mr. F.D. will travel
north to the tropical forests

 

along the Gulf of Campeche.
Traveling past the ancient walls
of Vera Cruz, he can view Aztec
Lord Montezuma greeting and
giving gifts of gold to the newly
arrived Spaniards who are led
by the. famous conquistador
Hernandez Cortez. Moving into
Doremus, Mr. F..D. will pass the
columns of Quetzalcoatl, God of
Morning, who, while journeying
to the Yucatan, was mysteri-
ously murdered. As_ legend
tells, Quetzalcoatl rose into the
sky and became the morning
star of Venus.
Quetzalcoatl’s Journey

Continuing along Quet-
zalcoatl’s intended journey, Mr.
F .D. will find Doremus changed
into the rain forests of the
Yucatan Peninsula. He can
view the abandoned ruins of the
two great cities of the Mayan
era, Palengue and Chicihen It-
za. Doremus will be jumping
with the rock and roll sounds of
the Producers as well as the
memorable beach and soul
sound of the Chairmen of the
Board.

Child Sacrifice

A spectacular display of
Aztec architecture will be found
in the new gym which will be
transformed into the center of
Teotihuacan — the ritual city of
the gods. Towering pyramids
line the Pathway of the Dead,
which leads to the Grand
Pyramid of the Moon. The ex-
citing sounds of the 1930s and
40s, provided by Lester Lanin

ANNIE JO WHITE

and his Orchestra, will recreate
the festivesinging and dancing
which once began the ceremony
of Tlaloc, the God of Rain. The
customary child sacrifice,
however, may be excluded.

City of Teotihuacan

Ascending the balcony op-
posite the Pyramid of the Moon,
Mr. F.D. will climb the
Pyramid of the Sun, where he
can view the ancient city of
Teotihuacan. The great Wall of
the Gods lies before him con-
taining colorful murals of Aztec
gods including Tezcatlipoch,
God of Providence, Xiuhtecuht-
li, God of Fire, Tlaloc, God of
Rain, and Centeol, God of Corn.
Exotic and interesting enter-
tainers will display talents new
and old on the balcony.

Temple of Inscriptions

Passing through the rain
forests of Chiapas, Mr. F.D. will
find the classroom changed into
the secret chamber of the Tem-
ple of Inscriptions. Here lie the
ancient hidden treasures of the
Mayan civilization. Roomful of
Blues, playing the hottest
rhythm and blues, and the com-
edy of the Rev. Billy C. Wirtz
are sure toentertain.

Many surprises await the
festive crowd throughout the
evening. This trip through
South American cultures of cen-
turies past promises to be the
most spectacular Fancy Dress
in history.

Take an energetic librarian,
$47, a handful of students in
costume, and you have the
essential ingredients of Wash-
ington and Lee’s first Fancy
Dress Ball in 1907. Seventy-
seven years later this annual
event requires the talents and
efforts of 50 Student Activities
Board members, six months of
planning, a budget of $70,000
and an expected turnout of 4,000
people.

Miss Annie Jo White, a W&L
librarian, initiated the Fancy
Dress tradition when she threw
a costume party for a few of her
student friends, using proceeds
from a theatrical production.
Aware of her possibilities for
social stimulus during the
doldrums of mid-winter, Miss
Annie set out to make her
February event an annual af-
fair. Her efforts were at first
greeted with student indif-
ference, but her persistence
paid off and her “balmasque”’
soon gained enormous support
and enthusiasm from the entire
W&L community.

Each year Fancy Dress grew
in popularity and prestige. By
1919 its extravagance and
elaborate decorations were

Fancy Dress has been inter-
rupted twice in its 76-year
history. It was discontinued
briefly during the war of the
early 40s and completely aban-

- doned for a three-year period

beginning in 1971. As The New
York Times reported that year:

“Perhaps, as one student
sighed, ‘it can be resur-
rected.’ ”’

of Mardi Gras, and the re-
vitalized tradition has been
growing in strength ever since.

Thursday night

 

SpongeTones, Push to play Thursday in Evans

By EDWIN BELL
Staff Reporter

Thursday night of the 77th An-
nual Fancy Dress Ball will start
off with a bang. Evans Dining
Hall will feature two of the
South’s hottest bands — Push
and the SpongeTones.

Both bands have received na-
tional recognition by the enter-
tainment world. Push is a 10-
man band from Petersburg, Va.
Its high-stepping, foot-tapping
funk will warm the audience up.

Afterward, the SpongeTones
will take the stage in a revival
of the 60s British invasion. This
“Fab Four” will bring out even
the most timid of the crowd. By
the end of the evening, everyone
should be danced out, while
remembering that the weekend
has only just begun.

Push will begin about 9 p.m.
Thursday. The 10-man group
was discovered by Bill McGee
and brought to Fun Town
Records. McGee most recently
has worked with Evelyn King,
SugerHill, Ray Goodman and
Brown and the O’Jays. Push’s
first single ‘Running For Your
Love’’ was added to many radio
playlists throughout the
Southeast. Their recent groove
effort is a 12-inch single called
“The Wave.”’ It has been

featured by Billboard magazine
as a ‘‘Top Single Pick’’ in the
“First Time Around Category.”’
Billboard describes the ““Wave’’
as a “sassy dance number in
the Parliment/Funkadelic vein,
full of spunk and humor.”

Each of the 10 members of the
band is very dedicated to
music. In addition to the three
years the band has performed
together, each member has
seven years of musical ex-
perience. Also, each member

SugarHill gang. Rounding out
the sound and providing the
rhythm is a set of keyboards,
bass, drums, synthesizer and
percussion.

After Push has worked the
crowd through a seat set,

Puterbaugh said, ‘‘the grooves
on ‘Beat Music’ are aglow with
a forward-thrushing musical
abandon that recalls the glory
days of many of the most
familiar British Invasion front
lines, including the Beatles, the
Dave Clark Five, the Zombies
and the Who of ‘Anyway,
Anyhow, Anywhere.’

State University. The group is
fronted by Calvin Dugger, who
is the lead singer and showman
who compels the audience into a
frantic frenzy. Dugger is back-

‘“‘K-9 horn.” (Saxophone, tenor

track to a party so good it could
never happen in real life.”’

Fancy Dress is certainly the
party that is so good it could
never happen in real life.

The group started out as a
local Charlotte band that played
Beatles’ covers. Member Pat
Walter describes the group’s
basic feeling. ‘The Spongetones

started out as something we lik-
ed and has become more fulfill-

ing than I ever imagined,” he
said. ‘I enjoy playing the type
of music people really respond
to.”

A favorable crowd response
from the beginning led the
group to dig even deeper into
the 60s and emerge with a com-
plete mastery of the period’s
sound.

The group is arranged similar
to the Beatles. Pat Walters
plays keyboards as well as
guitar. Steve Stoeckel, the Paul
McCartney look-alike with
beard, plays the bass. Jamie
Hoover shares vocals with
Stoeckel and Walters and plays
the recorder and guitar.
Journeyman Rob Thorne is the
fourth fab and sets the tempo on
the drums. And if you're
wondering what the name
SpongeTones means, band
members say that ‘It means
whatever you want it tomean.”’

So Thursday should satisfy
the tastes of everyone concern-
ed. Rhythm and blues appetites
will be whetted by the dynamic
singing and stepping of Push
and rock fans will be pleasantly
reminded of the British Inva-
sion,

Lanin returns
to take the stage

This year the Student Ac-
tivities Board has selected the
Lester Lanin Orchestra for the
Fancy Dress Ball as the head-
line act. Lanin’s music has been
described as “the beat heard
round the world.”

Booked for engagements up
to five years in advance, Lester
Lanin’s bands have played for
the Astors, the Chryslers, the
DuPonts, the Fords, the
Mellons, the Rockefellers, the
Vanderbilts and the Whitneys.
A favorite of British Royalty
and American, Canadian and
European society, Mr. Lanin
played at the Monte Carlo Ball
celebrating the engagement of
Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier
of Monaco. One of his most
memorable engagements was
when he played at the wedding
reception in honor of Prince
Charles and Princess Diana.
Said a guest at the Royal Wed-
ding, ‘‘Lester Lanin could make
an earthworm want todance!”’

Producers stop by on their way to the top

By EDWIN BELL
Staff Reporter

W&L has watched the Pro-
ducers rise from their origins as
an Atlanta-based band to a
regional favorite and most
recently to national pro-
minence.

The Producers’ Van Temple
offers his view of their rise,
‘“‘Through all these years,’’ Van
said, ‘I’ve just sort of gone
along having a good time, and I
consider this band as lucky
—the right time and right place.
Somewhere in the back of my
mind I’ve always felt, ‘I think
that I’m capable of doing this,’
but it’s never, for me, been a
goal — it’s just turned out this
way.”

With the recent loss of their
CBS/Portrait recording con-
tract, Wayne Famous’ words
from June of 1982 seem to ring
true for the present. ‘‘Our goal
is: No matter what, if we stay
together, something good is go-
ing to happen to our band.
We’ve had our trials and
tribulations with the record
company, and ridiculous people
handling us we had to get rid of,
but no matter what happens or
how many mistakes we make, if
we stay together, that’s the
ultimate power because that’s
what drew all these people here
in the first place.”’

Two years ago the Producers
drew a small crowd of W&L
Students together on the base-
ball field after a lacrosse game.
Despite dreary weather, the
band coaxed the sun to come out
and won many new fans. A year
ago the Producers returned to
headline “Spring Weekend’ at

Wilson Field. Their set was.

even tighter than their last and
a new album ‘You Make the
Heat’’ provided a larger selec-
tion of songs. Band members
claim that W&L is one of their
favorite places to perform and
Fancy Dress should certainly
prove this.

The Producers are a group
that combines four unique per-
sonalities and experienced
musical talent into one of the
brightest pop bands around.
Wayne Famous believes this
certainly is true.

The combination results in a
tongue-in-cheek, humorous,
fresh, always accessible smart
pop. The band has the standard

ingredients ~— guitar, bass,
drummer and an unusual stand-
ing keyboard.

The unique keyboards are
traced to Wayne Famous (no,
it’s not his real name). Wayne is
probably the most unlikely look-
ing rocker this side of Robert
Fripp. He is best remembered
by his happy feet dancing and
his constant facial contortions.
His keyboards are unusual
because they are worn around

his neck. The instrument is an
Oberhein OBX 8 voice
polyphonic synthesizer with 32
programs. He designed this
complicated-sounding contrap-
tion and paid $5000 to have it
constructed. Wayne’s musical
experience began at the age of
16, when he was influenced by
classicist Powell Everhart.
Members of the band cite

 

 

Wayne’s workaholic tendencies
as their backbone during tours.

‘“‘We’re a band that’s always
been willing to work, and we go
wherever there’s a job,’’ says
Wayne Famous. ‘‘When we’ve
been on the road for. four
months and play someplace we
haven’t been in awhile, we’re so
tight it’s overwhelming! It
keeps us growing and it makes
us a real band in the minds of
the fans.”’

Before the Producers, Wayne
toured in 1978 with Ellen Mcll-
waine and then met Bryan
Holmes and Van Temple, who
were playing in a band called
Cartoon.

Van had just left a band call-
ed Terminus and Bryan had
opted for a change of scenery
after playing in a jazz-rock
combo for several years. Van

Temple plays lead guitar and
shares vocals with Kyle. At an
early age Van’s father recogniz-
ed his son’s “‘rock affinity”’ with
guitars and bought him a Les
Paul Special. During this time
Van’s musical influences rang-
ed from Clapton to the ever
popular Beatles, which is
reflected in the Producer’s en-
core of ‘‘A Hard Day’s Night.”
Bryan Holmes also was a
member of Cartoon. Bryan join-

ed Cartoon in an effort to reach
a wider audience and more
readily accepted music. Bryan,
like Van, also had a childhood
fixation, except his was for a set
of drums. Bryan uses space-age
electronic drums that resemble
pieces of slate. Bryan believes
that the band has grown a lot
over the years, which he
believes is reflected in the dif-

 

THE PRODUCERS

eens

ference between their two
albums.

‘We'd only been together six
months or so when we wrote the
songs on the first one. They
came out very naturally, but
they have an innocent sound
about them. To me, the second
album reflects a mature band.
We’ve achieved a style we
simply didn’t have before.”’

The fourth member of the
Producers is the paragon of a

 

 

rock star. Kyle Henderson is the
youngest and probably best
known member. Kyle was once
a member of Whiteface, a fairly
well-known Atlanta band of
yesteryear. The group broke up
after a poor outing as an opener
for the Dixie Dregs and Sea
Level at a New Year’s Party in
the Fox Theatre. Kyle began his
musical experience as a cellist,
but has now grown to love the
bass. He cites his early in-
fluences as British Rock (Yes,
Genesis, ELP). Kyle shares
vocal chores with Van. He met
the other members one day at
an Atlanta bar. That day Car-
toon’s regular bassist was too
drunk to play, so Kyle jammed
with the band and was later ask-
ed to join the group. Kyle, Van
Bryan and Wayne became the
Producers in January 1980.
After an amazingly short
amount of time together the
Producers arrived in New York
in the spring of 1980. There, a
live audition for Tom Werman
(CBS Records) impressed him
so much he immediately signed
them to the CBS/Portrait label.
They entered the studio in
November and came out with
their first album. The Pro-
ducers’ first effort, sporting an
outrageously camp cover, sold
moderately well, with 30 per-
cent of the sales in Atlanta.

In order to make sure they
showed improvement before
entering the studio a second
time, the. Producers plotted
their fate more carefully.
Guitarist and vocalist Van Em-
ple summed up the group’s am-
bition before work on the second
album began:

‘‘We want it less slick, a more
raw studio sound — you know,
more like we really sound!”

“You Make the Heat’’ was
among the top five most added
radio albums in its first week of
release. The band’s vibrant
video of ‘‘She Sheila,” the first
single from “You Make the
Heat,” is aired on MTV. Later
that same year, the Producers
appeared on MTV’s New Year’s
Bash, which gave them the na-
tional exposure they needed.
The band has been together on-
ly four years but has achieved
what most bands do in their
lifetime.

Today’s new bands, especial-
ly techno-pop, are criticized for
never paying their dues. Groups
usually gain their respect in the
music industry by critical ac-
claim and constant touring. But
one segment of music that
doesn’t receive its proper share
of the lime-light and the
rewards (i.e. money) is also one
of the oldest. Blues is part of the
development of American
music that originated on the
southside of Chicago. Rhythm
and Blues has grown to in-
fluence many of the bands of the
British invasion, most notably
the Who and the Rolling Stones.

Several bands such as the
Nighthawks, the Fabulous
Thunderbirds and George
Thorogood have toured con-
stantly and received their share
of critical laurels in an effort to
+reak the blues curse. Yet the
recent success of Stevie Ray
Vaughn has brought hope to the
blues. His recent work on Band
Bowie’s “Let’s Dance,” and his
own album ‘Texas Flood’’ has
brought blues to the forefront.

Roomful of Blues is glad to
hear this news. They certainly
have received the hard-earned
respect of the critics. Their se-
cond album on Muse Records,
‘Eddie ‘Cleanhead’ Vinson and
Roomful of Blues” was lauded
by critics. The single ‘Friend of
Mine”’ was nominated for a
Grammy in 1983. Their third

Roomfnl:

A roomful of jump blues

album, “Blues Train,” with
Chicago shouter Bog Joe
Turner, was hailed as_ the
“comeback album of the year,”
by ‘Record Magazine.’ This
recent work has been niminated
for a Grammy in the category
of Best Traditional Blues
Record, along with fellow
bluesmen B.B. King and Stevie
Ray Vaughn.

Roomful’s recent single
“Please Don’t Leave’’ was
recommended by Billboard as a

 

    
     
   
   
 
     
    

  

the classiest acts in town. The
nine-piece ensemble traces its
roots to Rhode Island and was
founded in 1970. Every member
is a top-notch musician, both in
terms of soloing ability and in
ensemble contributions. Their
music is aptly named ‘jump
blues,”’ which is loosely defined
as black pop music of the late
’40s-’50s. It is music for happy
minds and thirsty feet.

The 90-minute set features a
steaming 60s soul segment, an

 

 

“Top Pick.’ The band is now
finishing their latest album at
the Cars’ Synchro studio, which
they hope will break the blues
curse for them.

So it is evident that Roomful
has the critical backing and
they certainly have paid their
dues. They have been touring
for 13 years averaging a
wearisome 225 nights a year.
Touring has fine-tuned their
solos and playing skills. The
concerts are where the band
has built its reputation as one of

equally hot sequence of New
Orleans-style R&B and several
songs that showcase the con-
siderable instrumental talents
of each individual musician.
The hottest spot of the night is
usually the jazzy instumental
duel between tenor saxophonist
Greg Piccolo and the band’s
secret weapon, 60-year-old
trombonist Porky Cohen. Every
show is a new challenge to the
band, but Roomful always
leaves ‘em dancing in the
streets.

The Rev. Billy Wirtz’s ‘heart-stopping boogie woogie ’

‘‘Heart-stopping Boogie
Woogie, Honey-drippin’ Blues
and Wine Drenched Testimon-
ials concerning Women with
Large Legs and Good Ole’ Boys
that like to Wear Dresses,”’ all
add up to the music that Rev.
Billy C. Wirtz simply calls,
“WARP-A-BILLY.”

Born in 1954, the Rev. Billy C.
Wirtz has lived the blues and
music he sings. Billy never
knew his real mother and
father, although it is rumored
that he was the product of a late
night indiscretion between a
sorority president from
Tuscaloosa, and a member of
James Brown’s Horn Section in
the back of a '52 baby blue El
Dorado, somewhere near Myr-
tle Beach, S.C.

Billy was abandoned and left
to die in the men’s room near

C.W.’s Snake and Monday
Farm just across the Florida
line. Saved from a_ certain
death, Billy was found and
adopted by the Reverend
Nathaniel Hosiah (A.K.A.
Divinin’ Rod) Wirtz, an
itinerant Geechie Piano Player
and the Human Pin Cushion in a
traveling carnival. So traveling
with his step-father, the little
Reverend spent his formative
years selling plastic busts of
Kitty Wells and retrieving the
ping-pong balls in the Hoochie-
Koochie shows.

For the next few years, the
teenage Reverend traveled the

country by mo-ped living on
Kool-aid and vienna sausage
and playing his piano in every
little juke joint in rest areas
along the way.

After several years of this,

Billy decided he needed a back-
up group to make the big time.
So after months of searching he
found them in Seattle, Wash., a
trio of midget Alaskan hookers
became the ‘“‘Dreamsicles” and
the new-legendary act was
born.

Although the group lasted on-

ly a short time, its success was
phenomenal, reaching such ar-
tistic heights as touring South
Dakota with Slim Whitman, and
once playing for an audience
that included a girl whose
cousin used to babysit for Bruce
Springsteen’s sister-in-law.

group disbanded when all three
members of the Dreamsicles
became mysteriously pregnant
and then had the nerve to in-
‘quate that the Reverend was
somehow involved.

Billy’s career slid quickly
after that, and finding himself
down to his last $500, he was
forced to seek work as a male
go-go dancer in one of those
clubs. But as he was walking in-
to a club one night, he noticed
an okra colored leisure suit in
the window of a men’s shop next
door, and as he stared at the
leisure suit, he heard a voice
that said, ‘‘Billy, I want you to
buy that leisure suit and a
fashion coordinated shirt to go
with it.” Billy bought the leisure
suit, and then the voice said,
“‘Now I want you to go out into
the wilderness,’’ so the
Reverend hopped on his mo-ped
and drove out into the forest.
The voice said, ‘‘I want you to
climb to the top of the mountain
and look to the west, and verily
you will see a girl scout camp
below you, and now I want you
to expose yourself to those Girl
Scouts.”’

Six months later, upon his
release from the correctional
institution, Billy formed the
First House of Polyester Wor-
ship and Teenage Desire.

Today, Billy plays what he
calls “The Deviled Ham Cir-
cuit” (as opposed to the chit-
tlen’ circuit) rockin’ his life
away. So, for an evening of
Satisfied Sickness and Smokin’
Boogie Woogie be sure and
catch the Rockin’ Reverend Bil-
ly C. Wirtz.

EC holds candidate forum

President

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

Communication between the
Executive Committee and the
student body, student apathy
and the honor system were the
major points of discussion dur-
ing yesterday’s debate between
the two candidates for EC
President.

Juniors Cole Dawson and
Darby Brower, both represen-
tatives on this year’s EC, field-
ed questions from the audience
at the forum. Possibly the most
difficulty the candidates en-
countered during the forum
arose when the two were asked
to differentiate between
themselves.

Brower, serving his second
consecutive year on the EC,
said, ‘‘I do not like to be pointed
out as a politician. I’m a little
too insecure for that.”

He added that he isn’t seeking
the job merely to improve his
personal qualifications. “I’m
more concerned with what’s go-
ing on right now than with the
future,”’ he said.

Brower described himself as

Vice President

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

Vice presidential candidate
Peter A. Baumgaertner said
Wednesday that the scope of
potential honor violations
should be limited to lying,
cheating and stealing. -

That position was an unusual
moment at the “Big Three’
forum, which otherwise was
dominated by the expression of
closely parallel views on a wide
range of issues.

The three candidates for vice
president are Baumgaertner, a
first-year law student; David N.
Jonson, a junior U.S. history
major; and James A. White, a
sophomore business adminis-
tration major who currently is a
member of the Executive Com-
mittee.

The chief function of the Vice
president is to manage the
disbursement of student body
funds, and the vice president
traditionally handles the ad-
ministrative aspects of honor
matters.

Witnesses have
some protection

Immunity possible in grand jury

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

A number of immunity op-
tions and other protections are
available to witnesses who
testify for the special grand
jury investigating drug traffick-
ing in-the Rockbridge area, ac-
cording to information gathered
from lawyers, law professors
and legal research.

The panel has summoned
over a dozen Washington and
Lee students, and many mem-
bers of the local legal communi-
ty believe that a number more
will be called before the in-
vestigative body provides its
recommendations to a regular
grand jury, which can then
issue indictments.

The earliest that could hap-
pen is May 7, which is just over
six months after the special
grand jury was convened.

A key legal principle that
someone who has been sub-
poenaed should remember is
that he must testify if called,
although he is not required to
provide self-incriminatory in-
formation.

However, if the prosecutor
grants the witness immunity

from prosecution, he can then
be compelled to provide full
testimony.

The Code of Virginia
specifically provides that any
witness appearing before a
special grand jury has the right
to have his lawyer present.

News
Analysis

The attorney may ‘‘consult
with and advise” his client dur-
ing the examination, but the
lawyer does not have the right
to conduct his own questioning
of the witness.

“I really recommend that
people appearing before the
drug grand jury take counsel
with them,’’ said one Lexington
defense attorney. ‘‘And that’s
not just to line our pockets.

“People are going into un-
familiar surroundings, they’re
nervous, and they’re not being
told what their rights are.”

Professor William S. Geimer,
who teaches criminal law at
Washington and Lee’s Law
School, voiced similar con-
cerns.

IFC to consider closed parties

By PETER WRIGHT
Staff Reporter

Independents at Washington
and Lee University may not be
able to attend fraternity par-
ties if a proposal before the In-
terfraternity Council is
adopted.

The IFC considered a policy
at Monday’s meeting forbid-
ding independents from atten-
ding sanctioned fraternity par-
ties without an invitation.

The proposition represents a
change in IFC policy which cur-
rently states that traternities
are permitted to close only two

parties per year.

The IFC will vote on the pro-
posal at its next meeting in the
University Center March 6, at
7p.m.,

IFC President Emery Ell-
inger said the restriction is in-
tended to form a generally
understood policy concerning
independents’ attendance at
fraternity parties. Ellinger
cited several reasons for the
proposal.

First, he pointed out the
financial burden placed on
fraternity members.

In regard to a ruling by the

Alcoholic Beverage Control
Board that prohibits frater-
nities from charging any non-
fraternity members who at-
tend their parties, Ellinger
said. ‘‘We think we are hurting
ourselves.”

Referring to a _ statement
made by an alumnus here at
W&L, Ellinger said, ‘‘Inde-
pendents are getting the best
deal in town.”’

Ellinger added that not only
is the non-fraternity atten-
dance financially burdensome,
but it might be affecting the

Review and Outlook

 
 

Closing Up?

In last week’s Interfraternity Council meeting, a
proposal was discussed that, if passed, would prohibit
independents from attending fraternity parties
without an invitation.

Although fraternities certainly have the right to
restrict attendance at their parties, something should
be said about the casual — if not always friendly —
relationship that has existed between fraternity
members and independents. In the past, there seems
to have been a nice social balance in which in-
dependents visited the fraternities with the exception
of the two closed parties each year. This social cir-
culation is an excellent means of stimulating campus-
wide discussion. It would be a shame to stifle such
discussion in a time of University transition and
uneasiness.

It is also very important to consider the actual
degree of change that would occur. Whereas now only
two parties may be closed, a significant jump would
be made to having all parties closed. It is important to
remember that independents could attend parties
with an invitation. By the same token, though, an im-
portant question to ask is whether such a blanket
policy is necessary or whether an intermediate
measure might be more equitable.

The IFC will vote on this proposal Tuesday. Bet-
ween now and then, it is necessary that fraternity
members discuss this matter among themselves as
well as with independents.

Earlier this year, the Executive Committee
discovered the pitfalls of operating with less than
complete student representation. We think it is impor-
tant for the Interfraternity Council to determine stu-
dent opinion to the greatest practical extent before

making a decision.

One of the IFC’s reasons behind the proposal is to
lower the financial burden on fraternity members.
_ The members would do well to consider the intrinsic
benefits they may forfeit.

Patterson draws support

To the Editors:

The elections for the “Big
Three” positions of the Ex-
ecutive Committee are Mon-
day, March 5. I recommend to
all students Nelson Patterson
for Secretary of the Executive
Committee.

Mr. Patterson has proven his
leadership ability and dedica-
tion to the University in several
capacities. The Executive Com-
mittee has, for the past two
years, appointed Mr. Patterson
to the Student Health Commit-

tee. In addition, Mr. Patterson
is presently the Vice-president
of the International Club, the
Executive Director of the Col-
lege Republicans, and the head
of sophomore accounts for the
Student Telephone Union.

I am confident that Nelson
Patterson will work for a fair
distribution of student funds

and uphold the system of honor
we all enjoy.

Election awareness

To the Editors:

The upcoming election
presents a chance for the W&L
student body to change student
government policy, a policy
which has been leading W&L in-
to the realm of mediocrity and
eliminating the chance to ex-
perience a liberal, enlightening
education. We have the chance
to bring W&L into the twentieth
century, however painful it may
be. But we have this chance on-
ly if we, the students, become
actively aware and educated as
to the positions of each of the
candidates, voting on this
premise and not that of mere
popularity. Otherwise, we will
continue to be governed by
“Good Ol’ Boys,”’ unwilling to
support and strive for progress,
and apt to utilize tradition as an
excuse for progress.

The power of the Executive
Committee is vast and far-
reaching; thus, it would be to
the advantage, of all pro-
gressive-minded students at
W&L to become familiar with

the positions held by can-
didates, particularly on issues
which could determine wether
W&L is to progress as an
academically strong and com-
petitive institution, or to wallow
in stagnant traditionalism. The
impending issue of coeducation
is one example which em-
phasizes this need for ‘‘can-
didate awareness.” Students
have the opportunity to elect a
student government which can
be open and supportive to a pro-
gressive measure such as this
one, and finally boost W&L into
the position that it deserves in
the ranks of higher education.
But all good things must
start.

front of him, The room was not
well ventilated.

Shortly thereafter I took my
leave, wondering to myself: if
this is the way this fellow reacts
to film footage of lots of
Aryan/master-race types
scrubbing and shaving them-
selves into a cleanly frenzy in
preparation for a Nazi rally,
who will he react to the unwash-
ed Bedouins of “Lawrence of
Arabia” (the next-scheduled
film), who must go for weeks
without bathing for fear of be-
ing blasted to smithereens by
an irate Omar Sharif keeping
watch over his sacred vasis?
Two possibilities, I figure.
Either 1) he will come in smell-
ing like a rose, or 2) he will
prepare himself by a) not
changing his socks from now
until the showing of
‘“‘Lawrence..” and b) eating fif-
ty bowls of baked beans shortly
before showtime, and declaring
“No prisoners!’ upon entering
room 327 of the Commerce
School on that fateful eve.

Although I was not particular-
ly smitten by the the Executive
Committee’s recent ‘‘necktie in-
itiative,” in light of recent
events I might be very recep-
tive to a ‘‘shoe initiative’ as a
means of clearing the air, so to
speak, of the vaporous degen-

eracy that is sweeping the cam-
pus.

W&L’s real traditions: past, present and future

By TOM CONNORS
Phi Columnist

The word “‘tradition” has

been thrown about quite a bit -

lately. It is one of those
strange political words that
changes implications from per-
son to person. At W&L we
often associate it with the aura
of honor surrounding the name
of Robert E. Lee. Lee’s name
ought not to be used to defend
unjust traditions, though, for
he was no opponent of change.
For example, at the outset of
the Civil War, he advised
President Davis to begin free-
ing the Confederate slaves

My View

gradually. While he presided
here, he reviewed our tradi-
tions, strengthening and
establishing worthy ones and
abolishing harmful ones. That
we ought to attempt achieving
the same balance is hardly an
assertion of any depth.

On vast theoretical plains,

 

tradition may seem fairly cut —

and dried. However, specifics
tend to mess things up in real
life. Anything old, young, or as
yet unborn may be classified
as tradition (or tradition to
be), given a narrator of near-
average skill. As proof of this,
I put forth the following obser-
vations, tenuously united under
the abusively broad heading of
tradition.

Speaking. The speaking
tradition fell ill during the
1960s around the same time the
dress code was laid to rest.
Both traditions had a common
cause for their downfall: the
expression of freedom from
the conventions of the
establishment pigs. Today
such a reason fails to stir any
feelings besides nostalgia or
regret.

A decade and a half later,
the tradition seems to be a lost
cause. Here is a far more no-
ble tradition than most. We are
a small school; the speaking
tradition emphasizes that we
are not in New York City. Our
community is a place where
walking need not be associated
with combat.

However, the fashionable big
city attitude is gaining fast. A
cold, cruel world surrounds us.
We hope not to be taken for
weak or sentimental gentle-
men. Unfortunately, no ex
cathedra proclamation, en-
couraging or threatening, by
the Executive Committee is
likely to restore this tradition.
Now, its future lies in ex-
amples set by individuals.

We might remember that
many of the unfamiliar
wanderers on campus are here
to honor Robert E. Lee. With
this in mind, and mindful that
we are (by apostolic succes-
sion of sorts) the General’s
“boys,”’ we would do well to

treat his guests well (and those
students, faculty and employ-
ees associated with his school
as well.) Then visitors could
take away a sense of the quiet
dignity of Lee’s South in addi-
tion to postcards of Lee
Chapel.

Drinking. One of W&L’s
oldest and most secure tradi-
tions is drinking. It is a subject
I am loath to raise and one
I’m not sure I can discuss
without evading issues.

When the cornerstone of
Washington Hall was laid —
sometime around 1824 or so —
“‘Jockey’’ Robinson threw us a
good party, even by present
standards. This was the
earliest recorded W&L bash as
far as I know. Anyway, Jockey
had sent us a keg of home-
made whiskey (and good
whiskey at that). Our
forebears here drank with
vigor enough to match our
own. When the line for the
spiked keg grew too long, too
slow or too something, the
party-goers determined to
speed things up — namely by
breaking open the keg’s top.
This allowed them to dip into it
with cups, ladles or whatever
was handy. In the onslaught
that followed, the keg over-
turned and the rest of the
whiskey lost.

Is there a moral here? I
doubt it. Jockey got all hacked
off. Later, he donated Robin-
son Hall, so his faith in us
couldn’t have been too deeply
damaged. Well, the point is
that the tradition is long-
standing. And when you next
walk across the front lawn,
you might try to think of an
empty hill and a keg of
whiskey still in service amidst
a rowdy gathering. And when
you pass the monument out
front of Tucker Hall, wonder
whether Jockey, now in his
grave, still finds our drinking
disquieting.

I don’t want to end drinking
at W&L; anyone who knows
me will laugh at the sugges-
tion. But maybe we could play
the hard guy a bit less often.

Independent Union. Since the
“EC still solicits any sugges-
tions for improving the W&L
experience for independents,”
I would like to help promote a
sound proposal (which aims to
begin a new tradition). The IU
(with which I have no connec-
tion) is organized by in
dependents and has given solid
ideas for arousing interest and
support: newsletters, meet-
ings, road trips, mailings,
bands, ets. etc. Furthermore,
the two co-chairmen are ob-
viously willing and young
enough (that is, not about to
graduate) to provide needed
energy, despite lack of en-
couragement from the EC. To
ask for funds to get such a
union started ought not to be
considered extraordinary.

It has been pointed out that
senior EC members have in-

dependent friends who are
cynical of the proposal. Why
shouldn’t they be? (The idea of
‘independent friends’’ seems

akin to such phrases as ‘‘some

of my best friends are...’’) In-
dependents have been ignored,

nicknamed ‘“‘GDIs’” (granted,
mostly in good humor), and
have noticed a certain amount
of disdain from the pillars of
the frat and student govern-
ment system. Certainly, the
EC’s insulting and sarcastic
response to, the IU’s request
and the later defenses of that
action are prime examples of
such behavior. Need I point out
that the student cynicism
referred to in the EC defense
is also the main cause of the
student apathy that the same
EC wishes to. see disappear?
Throwing water on sparks of
student enthusiasm and ambi-
tion will not generally aid the
cause of anyone fighting stu-
dent apathy. May the EC
reconsider. I hope the con-
troversy will not die until that
occurs.

Tea Lady. I can say from ex-
perience that the ‘round the
clock library goes back to 1980
at least. Most of us know that
the library is the best place in

town to get away from the
distractions of home and to the
distractions of the library. I
remember hearing the library
aptly described as ‘study car-
rels for 600 and sleeping for
1000.”

The library is also home to a
large number of W&L tea
societies who avoid Milton,
Keynes, Heidegger, Kepler and
Einstein by discussing any-
thing else. Until about 1970, a
woman was provided to serve
tea to these gentlemen (and
those gentlemen studying there
as well). She sharpened pen-
cils on the side.

Here is a tradition we would
do well to restore. Perhaps the
proposed new secretary for
student activities could func-
tion primarily as a “‘tea-lady”’
during peak library hours. She
could act as secretary in the
ume formerly alotted for pen-
cil sharpening. This certainly
is a way to serve a lot of
students in a positive manner.

Having looked at four
specific W&L traditions, four
different types of tradition
may be recognized: those that
ought to be strengthened,
reviewed, established or

reestablished. Like anything
worthwhile, tradition requires
balance if it is to promote
positive values.

This year we have had a
good many debates over tradi-
tions. If this is a sound time
for us to reexamine our tradi-
tions, why shouldn’t we? I
think this is a good time to do
so. In terms of academics,
reputation and finance, Presi-
dent Huntley left to his suc-
cessor a university in excellent
shape. The last ‘‘major’’
changes came about during the
late 60s; we are a different
generation with a new outlook.
In these debates we should
remember the rules. of
gentlemen undertaking such
tasks.

Respect is the key quality in
a gentleman. At a recent EC
debate during the Tie Crisis, I
found the childish disrespect
on both sides distasteful and
embarrassing. Even a little
disrespect for one’s opponent
is excessive; it only hurts the
defended cause. I have found a
lack of mutual respect on near-
ly every side of a ques-
tion. May we rise above it and
debate such questions rational-
ly and without haste.

Midterm review raises questions

By SCOTT MASON

Things had been calm for the
Executive Committee this
year...that is, until about six
weeks ago. With the controver-
sy over Independent Union
funding and the great necktie
saga, the EC has come under a
barrage of criticism. The calm
proved to be merely the calm
before the storm.

And storm it did. Letters
criticizing the EC and its con-
troversial decisions poured in-
to The Ring-tum Phi, while
verbal assaults “‘rained’’ upon
some committee members’
heads.

But the greatest blow to the
EC may have come from The
Ring-tum Phi. In the Phi’s
yearly review of individual Ex-
ecutive Committee members
(Feb. 9 issue), several
representatives were dragged
through the mud, criticized for
their lack of effectiveness as
EC representatives.

What is troublesome to many
is the power given the reporter
who writes the reviews. The
reporter has the ability not on-
ly to embarrass a represen-
tative with a negative review,
but can also ruin that repre-
sentative’s chances of winning
a student election if he ever
decides to run for office again.
Negative reviews are not easi-
ly forgotten by students who
depend upon The Ring-tum Phi
for EC coverage.

Sophomore representative
Ken Lindeman was a victim
this year of one of those

negative reviews. Among other
things, Lindeman was said to
have missed ‘crucial’
meetings.

Lindeman has since said the
“‘charges”’ were unfair, that he
missed the meetings because
he was sick and because of a
physical education class in ski-
ing that he would have
flunked had he skipped it.

Phi News Editor Bruce Pot-
ter, who wrote the reviews,
hadn’t known of Lindeman’s
illness but he had known of
Lindeman’s skiing class.

Reader’s
Advocate

Potter said his review was
accurate, that he interposed no
judgment of Lindeman as an
EC representative, good or
bad, when he wrote of
Lindeman’s absences. ‘I
haven’t said that, because he
missed three meetings, he’s a
totally useless EC member,”’
Potter said. ‘‘What I tried to
do was to present the facts and
let the students make the deci-
sion.”

But that’s not the way Ring-
tum Phi Chief Editor John
Cleghorn sees it. He thought
Potter’s review of Lindeman
was unjustifiably severe since
Potter hadn’t known the
reasons for Lindeman’s ab-
sences. ‘“‘We made a mistake,”’

 

 

Cleghorn said. ‘‘He (Potter)
was not doing a complete job
of reporting. He needed to ask
Ken why he missed those
meetings.”

Potter agrees with Cleghorn
in retrospect but said the time
constraints simply made it im-
possible to interview each
representative.

There’s more than one issue
invovled in all this, it seems.
How should a reporter go
about writing annual EC re-
views. Should he make the time
to interview each repre-
sentative, find out why a
representative is quiet, why
he’s ineffective, why he misses
meetings? Or should the
reporter rely on his personal
observations and on the facts,
on what a representative has
said and done, what sub-
committees he’s been on, what
issues he’s raised? Further,
should there even be EC
reviews: should the reporter
be given the potential to ruin a
representative’s future poli-
tical career?

A lot of questions can be
asked. But what Ken Linde-
man wants to know is why he
was given, in his opinion, a
bad review. He may never
know why.

Meanwhile, the storm that
had been hovering over the EC
has seemingly passed, and
criticism has subsided. It is
the Phi that this time should
have been the ones to bear the
brunt of those criticisms, for
carelessness and lack of
thorough reporting.

Lack of poll watchers causes EC controversy

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

The Executive Committee’s
failure to obtain a Voting
Regulations Board chairman
has resulted in confusion and
controversy over who should be
in charge of obtaining students
to man the polls during Mon-
day’s Big Three elections.

Pete Baumgaertner and Dave
Jonson, two vice-presidential
candidates, complained at Mon-
day’s EC meeting about up-
perclass law _ representative
Jim Green’s manning the polls.
Baumgaertner charged that
Green had actively campaigned
in the law school for two can-
didates, and that his presence
at the polls would remind voters
of those candidates.

Despite motions not to allow
any EC members to man the
polls and not to allow Green to
man the law school polls, the
issue was resolved with a
recommendation by President

 

Bob Jenevein that ‘‘the two co-
chairmen (Green and senior
representative Jim Messer) do
everything they can not to man
the polls themselves.”’

The debate over who should
man the polls began when the 10
candidates presented their peti-
tions at the beginning of the
meeting, and Jenevein re-
viewed the election rules.

Baumgaertner then com-
plained about Green’s manning
the polls and Green responded
by saying that he did not know
until Monday that he would be
in charge of obtaining poll-
watchers for the law school.
“From this point on, I can
assure you I will be totally
oblivious, or neutral, to the pro-
ceedings,’’ he said.

When Jenevein later asked
him if he would “have any prob-
lem being objective,’ Green
answered, ‘‘No.”

Nevertheless, Howard made
a motion that no EC member be
allowed to man the polls, but it

died because it was not second-
ed. ‘‘My concern is that we’re
going to have unmanned polls,”’
Jenevein said.

Green and Messer were given
the polling responsibility
because the EC has yet to find a
VRB chairman to_ replace
Burns Newsome, who is not at
W&L this semester. The only
application received for the
position was rejected.

This produces a situation,
Baumgaertner said, in which
“you have EC members run-
ning their own elections.”

Although Green gave his
“personal honor’’ not to cam-
paign while at the polls,
freshman representative An-
drew Caruthers made a motion
that Green not be allowed to
man the law school polls and
that Messer not be allowed to
man the undergraduate campus
polls. He later changed it to just
preventing Green from mann-
ing the law school polls.

Green pointed out that,
because of classes, he didn’t
have time to man the polls
himself and would try to find
other people to man them.

“T think we’re really getting a

tempest in a teapot here,” he _

said, before Jenevein’s recom-
mendation.
Debate over who should man

the polls highlighted both the
beginning and the end of the
meeting and overshadowed the
first and second freezing of
funds by the EC this year.

The Film Society, originally
scheduled to report at the Feb. 6
meeting, which was postponed
because of the public honor
trial, presented a written report
but had no one at the meeting to
answer questions.

Senior representative Jim
Messer’s motion to freeze the
society’s funds was approved
9-1-1, with secretary Len
Howard against and Green ab-
staining. The Film Society thus
became the first organization

’ this year to lose its student body

funds until it reports in person
to the EC.

  
  
     

Only moments later, though,
the Hockey Club also had its
funds frozen. Peter Muller was
at the meeting to answer ques-
tions, but no written report had
been prepared.

A first vote on the motion to
freeze the Hockey Club’s funds
resulted in a 5-5-1 tie, with
Messer, junior representatives
Darby Brower and Cole
Dawson, Jenevein and Vice-
president Dave Judge voting to
freeze the funds, and Green abs-
taining.

Judge said the EC couldn’t
freeze the Film Society’s funds
and not the Hockey Club’s. “I
think we’re showing a lack of
uniformity,”’ he said. ‘‘We’re
just being arbitrary.”

Howard disagreed: ‘‘The pur-
pose of freezing funds is to deter
the chronic failure to show up
that some clubs have. If the
Hockey Club knows - (they’re
supposed to be here), there’s no
point in our freezing their funds
to draw attention to it.’’

After a few minutes of listen-
ing to what he described as
“eloquence,’’ Green changed
his vote to support freezing the
funds, a motion that then pass-
ed 6-5.

The EC also heard several
budget reports, including that
of the 1984 Mock Democratic
Convention, Monday night. Co-
chairman Peter Muller _re-
ported that Saturday’s pavilion
party “‘lived up to our highest
expectations,’’ and that the
Mock Convention expected to
raise about $1,000 from it.

Not counting funds earned
from the party, the Mock Con-
vention has raised 76 percent,
or $77,974, of its goal. Co
chairman Steve Lewis said that
money earned from suppliers,
journal advertisements and
memorabilia sales would in-
crease the total raised to about
94 percent of the goal.

“We are in really strong
financial shape,”’ Lewis said,
although he added that the Con-
vention has. been unable to
secure a keynote speaker yet.

The EC also heard budget
reportes from the Calyx, which
announced that three frater-
nities still had not paid for last
year’s yearbook picture; the In-
ternational Club, which tied for
the second best delegation at
the Model UN at Princeton in
February; and the Fencing
Club.

scene. Irvine said about 20-30
minutes were required to bring
the fire under control and that
no injuries were reported.

James A. Jones, owner of
the house, said he had asked
two contractors for estimates
on the damage but would not
receive any response until the
end of the week.

Asked to estimate the
damage, Jones said a
“‘guesstimate’’ would be be-
tween $15,000 and $25,000, not
including damages to the
students’ property.

Junior Kevin McClatchey,
who returned from the W&L
library to the house about 11
p.m. with the fifth resident,
John Lee Graves, said his and
Graves’ belongings suffered
some smoke damage.

Minnich, in whose room the
fire started, ‘‘lost every-
thing...except his class ring,”
McClatchey said.

damages.

The fire apparently started
when a desk lamp on the arm
of a sofa in Minnich’s room fell
onto the sofa. The lamp,
turned on at the time, caused
the sofa to catch fire, Irvine
said.

Because Minnich’s room is
at the front of the second floor
and the television room at the
back of the first floor,
McClatchey said, Cregan and
Minnich did not realize the
house was on fire until] Brooks
came home.

Brooks tried to go up the
stairs but was turned away by
the smoke. He did manage to
rescue Cregan’s_ stereo,
though, McClatchey said.

Brooks, Cregan and Minnich
then went outside and saw the
windows in Minnich’s room
blow out.

Brooks’ room suffered no
damage, McClatchey said.
However, Cregan’s first-floor
room suffered water damage
when a fireman, moving the
burned sofa from Minnich’s
room directly above Cregan’s,

stepped through the floor,
causing water to drain into
Cregan’s room.

Although Jones had _in-
surance on the house, “‘it is go-
ing to cost me money,” he
said, “‘because I still have to
pay the mortgage and I won’t
have any rental income.”’

The five students are living
with friends this week, and
McClatchey, Graves and Min-
nich expect to move into
another house soon.

Jones said the fire wasn’t the
students’ fault. ‘‘There was no
negligence,’’ he added. “‘If this
is bad luck, good luck might
have prevented it. With some
good luck, it might never have
happened.”

Committee to issue study on
proposed fraternity changes

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

An ad hoc committee ap-
pointed to study several aspects
of fraternity life at Washington
and Lee will issue its report
within the next few weeks, Dr.
John M. Evans, chairman of the
committee, said Tuesday.

“We're not recommending
anything revolutionary. They
are just housekeeping proposals
on things they can do better,”’
Evans said.

Evans did not want to com-
ment on any specific recom-
mendations the committee was
making because the group was
still in the process of determin-
ing what the final recommenda-
tions would be.

Evans cited five issues the
committee was to consider:
physical condition and ap
pearance of fraternity houses,
the sophomore monopoly of
fraternity residences, the dura-

   

tion and character of midweek
parties, security problems aris-
ing from open parties and the
timing and character of Rush.
“The committee was not
designed to attack fraternities,
but to make them work more ef-
ficiently. The goal is to
strengthen the system and to
avoid drastic conflicts between
the fraternities, the university

and the community,” Evans
said.

The committee began meet-
ing in the fall, and for the last
two months the committee has
been meeting about twice a
week, Evans reported

“‘We’re coming to a conclu-
sion now, and we're fine-tuning
our recommendations,’’ Evans
said.

thought this year’s EC listened
to the students, but when
students’ views overrode their
own, they voted their cons-

vote the students’ views
whether or not they coincided

Monyek asserted that he
didn’t like labels. Monyek add-
ed that he thought the “key to
communication was visibility.”’

Rikhoff stresses that he would
bring an “objective and logical
voice which represents the en-

said he wants to put the EC in
its proper jurisdiction, in
reference to EC decisions con-
cerning drug-dealing and the
necktie issue.

Sophomore Nelson Patterson
pledged to bring ‘‘a new voice”’
to the committee and called for
a second-year law represen-
tative as well as a guaranteed
Big Three position for a law stu-
dent. Currently there is only a
freshman law representative
and an upperclass law
representative. No Big Three
offices are allotted to a par-
ticular class.

Dawson called for increased
communication between the EC
and the student body. ‘‘One of
the biggest problems I’ve found
this year was communication
with the student body,” he said.

Dawson later called for a poll

of student opinion on all major
issues, but not too frequently.
“Trying to tap the student body
through polls too often cuts
down on their effectiveness,’’ he
said.

Brower said improving the
communication process should
begin with better orientation
programs for freshmen and for
first-year law students and also
a better relationship with the
faculty.

Brower called for more com-
bined efforts between subcom-
mittees to reduce student
apathy. He cited as examples
the Independent Union working
with the Student Activities
Board and the Mock Convention
working with Contact.

“All the subcommittees need
to learn to work together,”

IU seeks

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

Despite being denied funds
by the Executive Committee
earlier in the semester, the In-
dependent Union met Tuesday
evening to discuss possible
social events and sign up for
intramural athletics.

Although lack of funding has
‘changed the game plan
slightly,” according to IU co-
chairman Jim Sarle, his goals
for independents remain basic-
ally the same.

‘‘Previously, it was my hope
that we could generate some
ideas and put them into prac-
tice with the money we had
hoped to get from the EC.

Brower said, ‘‘to get them away
from their more familiar
ground.”

Brower defined the present
Rush system as a major con-
tributor to apathy because it
breaks up the freshman class
before students have a chance
to get to know one another.
Although he said he doesn’t sup-
port moving Rush to winter
term, he said he would like to
see it extended over a six-week
period.

The present system, under
which a student has to make a
decision in four weeks, is not
healthy, Brower said.

Dawson disagreed, though,
saying, ‘‘Rush is one of the
more positive aspects as far as
combating student apathy. I
mean, not to knock what you’re
saying, Darby. :

“For me, the apathy is that
the students aren’t completely
aware of the honor system and
what they’re taking part in,’’
Dawson added.

He would emphasize ‘‘the
more positive aspects of the

honor system” and ‘‘the tradi-
tions of W&L” during orienta-
tion and in the EC President’s
letter to incoming freshmen.

Dawson defended the EC’s
decision last fall to declare that
drug dealing may be considered
dishonorable. ‘“‘Drug dealing is
a dishonorable act, as far as I
am concerned,” he said.

“T just don’t think that fosters
a good, secure feeling within the
community. It might be a stu-
dent control matter; it might be
anEC matter. Each case should
be assessed on its particular
merits.”

Brower also called for more
student respect toward the
honor system. ‘The students
feel that we’re the masters of
the honor system and that we
run them, whereas it’s really
the other way around,” he said.
“We serve them, and they’re
the body of the honor system.”

“I want this school to be a
good, working community and
for every person to feel he can
trust everyone else who’s walk-
ing around,” Brower added.

ideas and funds

Ideally, I’d still like to do the
same things,”’ said Sarle.

Seventeen students came to
the IU’s meeting, including An-
drew Caruthers, the freshman
EC representative recently ap-
pointed to the IU as an ad h
member. :

At the meeting Sarle express-
ed his fear that the financial
situation may have caused a
waning of interest, as -in-
dicated by Tuesday’s small
turnout compared to two
earlier meetings. Most of the
hour-long gathering was spent
discussing dues and _ social
functions, along with a sign-up
for intramural basketball,
volleyball and soccer.

“To collect dues...would be a
tremendous asset to the IU,”
said Caruthers, who noted that
this would show the EC and
the Student’ Activities Board
that there is a firm commit-
ment.

The SAB would be open to IU
suggestions, Caruthers said,
adding ‘‘I’d appreciate sugges-
tions. I’m free to talk to
anyone about anything at any
time.”

In a Jan. 26 letter to the Phi
members EC president Robert
C. Jenevein said he did not ex-
pect the IU to collect any dues.

“The EC will again act on its
belief that real interest will
generate real income. I do not
expect the IU to collect any
dues,’’ wrote Jenevein.

Sarle, who hopes to attract
_25 to 50 dues-paying members,
expressed his desire to collect
$5 from each union member
next year. ‘I would like to at-
tempt to collect...$2 from
members for the rest of the
year,”’ he said, and a consen-
sus seemed to favor the idea,
although no actual vote was
taken.

Sarle feels the dues is
necessary more as an indica-
tion of student interest than as
a money-maker.

The rest of the meeting was
spent discussing possible up-
coming activities including
parties with women’s schools
and trips to lacrosse games
and concerts.

There is about $60 in the IU
coffers, according to Sarle,
who received a $75 check from
Dean of Students Lewis G.
John in late January. Since
then, the IU has spent money
contacting students about in-
tramurals and printing flyers.

Movie Review

 

‘Terms’ is
endearing

By CHARLIE ALCORN
Staff Reporter

Let it be known that for the
first time since I have been
writing reviews about flicks in
Lexington, I have nothing horri-
ble to say about a movie. “Im-
possible,” you say? Go see
Terms of Endearment for
yourself and try to find a part
bad enough to quarrel with.
That’s right, you can’t find a
New Yorker with good man-
ners, either. (Sorry, guys, it’s a
quote from the movie.)

This movie deserves all the
accolades and awards it has
already garnered and is poised
to receive. I won’t pretend to be
able to elaborate on exactly
why Terms of Endearment is so
good, other than that one gets
the feeling that it was exquisite-
ly handled in every detail.

The performances of the prin-
ciple characters, Aurora
(Shirley McClaine), the eccen-
tric Texan momma; Emma
(Debra Winger), Aurora’s

 

daughter and the movie’s chief

heart-wringer; Flap Horton
(Danny DeVito), the English
professor-husband who sees to
be trying to emulate one of
Shakespeare’s tragic figures;
and Craig Breedlove (Jack
Nicholson), a boozing,
teenager-chasing, widow-
wooing, swimmer-ex-astronaut
extraordinaire — are all of the
caliber that probably should be
seen several times to be fully
appreciated.

I have just viewed Terms for
the third time, and each time
has been one of. wonderful in-
dulgence, sitting for two and a
half hours as these characters
and their stories subtlely
manipulate the audience. Terms
of Endearment runs the gamut of
emotional experience, and _ it
may make some viewers pout a
bit at being handled so roughly
at the end, but it is worth it.

My advice to the W&L movie-
goer is to go see it with a friend,
or maybe alone, probably not
with your Fancy Dress date
(waterproof mascara is a
must), possibly with your
favorite liberal arts professor,
who could enlighten you on the
existential highlights of the film

much better than I, or maybe |

with your cook at the fraternity.
It doesn’t matter; just don’t
miss it because Lexington (or
Cannes for that matter) rarely
has it so good.

 

 

Litho display

The works of six modern

is an innovative graphic design
company striving to combine

in duPont

the creativity of fine American
artists with the technology of
State-of-the-art printing tech-
niques. The prints on exhibit
are, therefore, unique because
they represent the best artists
and printmaker.

The six artists, Ronald Davis,

By EDDIE CURRAN
Staff Reporter

Last week I opened up a
review of Lexington fast food
fried chicken with our branch of
the world famous Kentucky
Fried Chicken franchise, and
now it’s time to check out the
competition, something few of
you probably do. I logically will
move on to Kenneys, as it is the
most similar to KFC (with
respect to format — both offer
the traditional snack pack, with
coleslaw, roll, plastic utensils
and folded piece of pre-wetted
face wipe).

Eat Beat

Because Kenneys is not often
discussed or even attended by
very many Washington and Lee
students, and because it’s not
easily seen from any well-
traveled road, directions are
necessary. Assuming you know
where the Greyhound bus sta-
tion is, keep going up the hill
next to it, and you can’t miss
Kenneys, which sits alone,
triumphantly on the very top of
the hill. Whereas KFC serves
only chicken, as they brag, Ken-
neys is basically a burger joint
which also serves chicken. Of
all the fried chicken in Lex-
ington, Kenneys’ is the least
visually attractive; it doesn’t
look repelling, but it doesn’t
look mouth-watering either.
The pieces are small, not much
bigger than KFC pieces, and
greasy. When I checked back on
the notes I made a week ago
when I ate it, I noticed more
grease spots on my Kenneys
notes than on any other, and I
remembered why. But, it tastes

all right and stays open later
than any of the other places.
One major drawback with Ken-
neys is that you can only buy it
in their pre-packaged combina-
tions — you can’t get, say, an
all-white snack or a breast by
itself. Only wings are sold in-
dividually.

Yet with one respect, Ken-
neys whips KFC: instead of giv-
ing you one of those weightless,
tasteless, nondescript rolls that
ends up in the trash can, they
give you a deepfried biscuit and
a packet of honey. It’s the best
thing in the box.

The final two fried chicken
outlets in Lexington are the two
supermarket delis, at Kroger
and Safeway. Choosing between
Kroger’s chicken and KFC can
be difficult, and depending on
what you look for in fried
chicken, Kroger might suit you

better. Texturally, it’s crunch-
ier than KFC regular, and it has
a lot of taste as well. But after a
couple of pieces, it begins to
taste a bit rich, because an
unusually large portion of what
there is to eat from a piece of
Kroger chicken is the fried out-
side. Kroger’s pieces look big-
ger than they are, because the
fried outside layer (the skin? ) is
very thick. Often a big piece
will jut out and all it will be is
more fried outside layer, and
not meat. This suits me just fine

until about the third piece, when
it starts to taste very rich, and
what I really want is more
white meat. But if you just want
a piece or two, Kroger is good.
And here’s a tip: Kroger’s deli
closes at about 6:30 each night,
and they put together packets of

as many as seven or eight
pieces for as little as $1.50. But
you need to get there on time,
because too many people
already know this.

But the Safeway crunchy is a
different story, and as of Tues-
day, they were still serving it.
The pieces are the biggest in
town, and, though not real
crunchy, it tastes good. I
recommend that you buy it hot,
as they offer it cold as well.
Though I’m usually a fan of cold
fried chicken, Safeway puts it in
a plastic container with not-so-
tasty potato salad and a piece of
dessert on a bed of lettuce; this
seems to take away from the
flavor and the moisture. But the
hot, non-breaded chicken at
Safeway provides an adequate,
if not memorable, fried chicken
eating experience.

Safeway, like KFC, offers two
types of chicken, one breaded,
the other somewhat crunchy.
The lady there told me they
were experimenting, and were
moving towards having only the
breaded. That would be a
mistake, as their breaded fried
chicken was the worst piece in
my sample, primarily because
it was dry and I don’t go for
breaded fried chicken. With
breaded chicken the fried outer
layer doesn’t so much stick to
the chicken as it contains it. It’s
like having chicken-in-a-pita
—the chicken is unwrapped
rather than picked at, and you'll
never have to lick your fingers.
If you prefer breaded chicken,
then I recommend you get a TV
dinner, and you'll get some
complimentary. mashed _pota-
toes and glow-in-the-dark peas
and carrots mix to go with it.

In this review of Lexington’s
take-out fried chicken, I have
been short on high praise, due
probably to the fact that I’ve
been spoiled on some great
fried chicken. So here’s what an
ideal piece of chicken is: As the
breast is my favorite piece, it’s
a breast. It is very big, about
the size of 3 KFC breasts, and it
holds within many strips of
moist, sweet white meat (a cer-
tain sweetness is a must in truly
delicious chicken, and I never
once experienced this sweet-
ness in Lexington chicken).
This piece does not need salt, as
the batter is plenty spicy on its
own, in a very subtle way. The
fried outer layer is crunchy and
flaky, and finds its way into
each crack and crevice in this
huge piece of chicken, and once
you’ve finished it, your cat
won’t even be interested.

Next week, The Ring-tum Phi
gets a large bill for a Fancy
Dress dinner for two at the
Aloha Wok.

IU head questions EC rep

To the Editors:

I confess that I don’t always
read the Phi carefully, and
quite often I take it for granted.
However, after reading the Phi
of Feb. 23, I trust that I will no
longer take it for granted, nor
will I skim read it.

In Bruce Potter’s regular sec-
tion covering the Executive
Committee meetings, I found
out that the EC did not learn
from its tie blunder. At the close
of its meeting on Feb. 20, it once
again abused its power. Quite
frequently, the EC will appoint
ad-hoc members to various stu-
dent groups to ensure that they
are properly using the money
the EC has allocated to them.

Therefore, you can imagine
my surprise when I read in Mr.
Potter’s article that the EC had
appointed Andrew Caruthers
ad-hoc member to the Indepen-
dent Union, This from a group
who said “you’re not going to

KV

get a dime’”’ and “‘you would be
better off calling yourselves the
‘Camel Watcher’s Club’.”’
Several members of the EC
were sarcastic and rude when
we requested money, and its
leader and president was

_ quoted in the Phi as saying that

the IU would not be around
long. So why then did he appoint
Mr. Caruthers, who was one of
the loudest critics of the IU at
the meeting? After all, since we
got no money and the EC does
not believe we will be around
long, they have no right to ap-
point an ad-hoc member to the
IU.

While we welcome the chance
to work with Mr. Caruthers and
the EC, I must question their
motives. From Mr. Potter’s ar-
ticle, I gathered that Mr.
Caruthers was concerned that
the IU was not working with the
SAB. Well sir, we have spoken
with the SAB, and they have

helped us to put a band in the
Cockpit on Saturday night of
Fancy Dress weekend. Further,
the reason we have not done
more is because Andy Cooney
(SAB Chairman) and other SAB
leaders have expressed a desire
to wait until after Fancy Dress.
If Mr. Caruthers is genuinely

concerned that not enough is be-
ing done, why doesn’t he urge
the EC Committee on Inde-
pendents to do something?
After all, they have done less
than both the IU and the SAB.
Hmm, perhaps I will appoint an
ad-hoc member to the EC to en-
sure that they do their job. Any
volunteers?

Mr. Caruthers, I look forward
to working with you and the EC
as a whole, however, it is
because I am trying to open and
strengthen lines of communica-
tion, and not because I readily
accept the Executive Commit-
tee’s continued abuse of its
power.

 

 

Ties retlect respect

To the Editors:

In a time fraught with war
and pestilence, it should matter
little to the world whether
students at Washington and Lee
wear neckties, or shoes, or
whatever their dress might be.
This, we are told, is the age to
be casual, to do one’s own thing,
the era of the free spirit.

But I was saddened when I
read that student leaders at
W&L had succumbed to populist
pressure and rescinded their
recommendation to require ties
in the classroom.

A necktie, of course, carries
no special significance, but
wearing one is a part of being
well dressed, It seems an ap-
propriate gesture of respect to

Washington and Lee, great men
who gave character and name
to the university at Lexington.
Last fall, as a tourist I walked
the campus where their spirits
seem still to live. There was
nothing casual or common
about these men, no flexible
standards on right and wrong.
They towered above their peers
as leaders, strong and un-
yielding.

On the campus I felt an
awareness of their presence. As
indicated, the matter seems
trivial, but were I a student, I
would want my attire to be ap-
propriate for such company.

The purpose of this letter is to
inform all W&L lacrosse fans
that the athletic department’s
contract with the City of Buena
Vista prohibits the drinking of
alcoholic beverages in public
and should any such drinking
take place, the contract will be
terminated,

In reference to last Satur-
day’s scrimmage against North
Carolina, the Glen Maury Park
Supervisors were more than
pleased with the fans coopera-
tion in putting beverages in
cups, but the City Police were
not and wanted to enforce the
city ordinance of ‘‘No public
consumption of alcoholic
beverages” whether brown-
bagged or not. It is unclear at
this time whether or not tickets
will be issued in the future
should the police become aware
of the presence of alcoholic
beverages.

The W&L lacrosse program is
fortunate to Mave the use of the
“all weather”’ field and I ask for
your cooperation in adhering to
the Buena Vista City Codes so
that Glen Maury Park can con-
tinue to be an an asset for the
Generals.

Thank you and I look forward
to your support this spring.

plained, he can cite you with
contempt. Then a judge will
rule as to whether you were

 

justified in refusing to answer.

Should he find you were not
justified in withholding the in-
formation, you’re usually given
the opportunity to comply,
Geimer said.

Because of that procedure,
the dispute must concern a
question the prosecutor is will-
ing to defend in open court.

‘People ought to understand
that if they act in good faith, the
world isn’t going to come to an
end because they refuse to
answer a question they think is
improper,’ Geimer said.

According to Geimer, such
questions might include ones
which are irrelevant to the
stated purpose of the investiga-
tion, and questions which are
exceptionally broad and
therefore are not within the
scope of information which

could be useful to the pro-
secutor.

He said that some questions
which are being asked ‘‘have no
conceivable, legitimate ex-

_ planation that could make them

relevant.”

The Fifth Amendment to the
Constitution protects citizens
from being forced to testify
against themselves. (The 14th
Amendment makes that ap-
plicable to the states, as well as
to thefederal government. )

That right is not uncondi-
tional, however. On May. 22,
1972, in Kastigar v. United
States, the Supreme Court said
that the court ‘‘can compel
testimony from an unwilling
witness who invokes the Fifth
Amendment privilege against
compulsory  self-incrimination
by conferring immunity....”’

There are two principal types
of immunity, and someone testi-
fying for a body such as the
special grand jury should
understand the difference.

The narrower type is ‘‘use
and derivative use,’’ ‘“‘use and
fruits,” or simply ‘“‘use’’ im-
munity. The Supreme Court has

ruled that this is the only type of
immunity which must be
granted to force testimony.

It allows the person who was
granted immunity to later be
prosecuted, as long as the
evidence was obtained prior to
the time that he testified. What
he said or what could be derived
from it could not be used
against him.

The broader, more desirable
type of immunity, is ‘‘transac-
tional immunity.” This protects
a witness from action against
him for all crimes to which his
testimony relates.

This unequivocal immunity is
usually offered by a prosecutor
who wants to gain maximum
cooperation from a particular
witness.

Virginia dealing with drug mat-
ters grants automatic testi-
monial immunity to a witness
testifying about “‘any offense
alleged to have been committed
by another.”’

If in providing such informa-
tion, someone offers testimony
or evidence ‘‘tending to in-
criminate himself,’’ such
evidence ‘‘shall in no case be us-
ed against him nor shall he be
prosecuted for the offense as to
which he testifies.’

This Code section is the sub-
ject of heated debate among
local lawyers, because ap-
parently no judge has ever rul-
ed as to whether it applies to
special grand juries.

It appears to be applicable,
because it is pertinent to
regular grand juries, and
special grand juries are dealt
with in the same chapter of the
Code that regular grand juries
are.

“I can’t imagine any reason
for the legislators intending to
differentiate between types of
grand juries,’’ Geimer said.

Professor Roger D. Groot, a
W&L law professor who is de-
scribed by one of his colleagues
as ‘‘an expert in Virginia
criminal law,” said, “It says it
covers people testifying before
‘the’ grand jury. I’d be more
comfortable with it if it said ‘a’
grand jury.”

Also, the statute refers to an
“offense alleged to have been
committed by another,” and in
an investigative situation such
as this, a specific charge may
not be in mind when someone is
brought in for questioning.

The Code requires that the
foreman tell each special grand
jury witness that “‘he need not

answer any question or produce

any evidence that would tend to

incriminate him.” That is, of

course, until such time as im-

munity is granted. .

If the drug section applies,
refusing to testify or provide
materials is a Class 2 misde-
meanor, which is punishable by
up to six months in jail, a fine
not greater than $500, or both.

Even the lawyers are confus-
ed and uncertain about all of
this. The advice nearly all of
them giye is to get a specific
grant of immunity, and not rely
on whatever statutory protec-
tion you may or may not have.

“To be on the safe side, get
specific immunity,’’ Groot said.
“You may have it in the ab-
stract, but get it for this par-
ticular case. Then everything
will be clear if any claim is ever
raised.”’

“Get the Commonwealth on
the record,’’ Geimer said. ‘‘If
you have any doubts, say, ‘I
refuse to answer on the grounds
that I might incriminate
myself.’”’

One local lawyer who has ac-’
companied clients into the
special grand jury proceedings
said, ‘Don’t take any chances, I
tell my clients to get all the im-
munity they can get.”

He said that people who
testify are not being advised of
their specific rights and
vulnerabilities.

He also said that when the
special grand jury was just
starting, “the Commonwealth’s
Attorney was routinely grant-
ing immunity on specific ques-
tions.

“If you ask for it, now he is
more likely to grant blanket im-
munity.”

Track wins first ODAC title

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
track and field team won its
first Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference indoor track and field
championship Friday at VMI.

The Generals won the meet
despite the fact that they won
only one event, the 3,200-meter
relay. Sophomores Ron Moody
and Conrad Boyle teamed with
junior Mark Pembroke and
senior Paul Chapman to run the
distance in 8:15.

W&L outscored second-place
Lynchburg by five points, 98-93,
on the strength of five second-
place finishes and four third-
place results. Second-place fin-
ishers were Pembroke in the 800
meters, freshman John Carder
in the pole vault, sophomore
Billy Rhinehart in the triple
jump, the 400-meter relay team
and the 1600-meter team.

W&L track coach Norris
Aldridge, who was selected as
the ODAC Coach of the Year,
stressed that it was a team ef-
fort that led to the Generals’
success.

“It was a real team victory,”
said Aldridge.’ ‘‘Our depth and
our attitude were the reasons
that we won. We had people in
every event and most of them
were charged up for the meet. A
lot of our people had personal
best results.”’

Tri-captains for the 1984 team
are seniors Angus McBryde and

Charlie Alcorn and junior Chris
Ives. McBryde, who holds three
school records, became W&L’s
first cross country All-
American in the fall when he
finished 10th in the NCAA
Championships. Alcorn took se-
cond place in the shot put at
both the indoor and outdoor
ODAC championships last year.
Ives doubles as a sprinter and a
hurdler and should be a factor
in both events this year.

The Generals’ next meet, the
teams’s first encounter of the
outdoor season, will be against
Davidson at Davidson, N.C., on
March 17. Aldridge feels that
his team’s recent victory could
lead to a successful outdoor
season.

“This was a good starting
point for us,’’ Aldridge said,
“but if we’re to do well out-
doors, we must continue to work
hard andimprove.”

Dead team takes title

By MICHAEL MCALLISTER
Special to the Phi

The indoor soccer league
season and playoffs are finished
and a team named The Dead
captured the championship.

‘“‘What?”’ asks the avid indoor
soccer fan. ‘‘The league is in the
middle of the season and
anyway The Dead is a rock
group, nota soccer team.”’

While the fan is of course talk-
ing about the professional Ma-
jor Indoor Soccer League, the
league in question is Washing-
ton and Lee’s.

Although W&L’s indoor soc-
cer league does not receive a lot
of publicity, it has been in ex-
istence for seven seasons at
W&L with a high level of par-
ticipation. This season saw
around 80 players take part in
the action.

Piranian runs the league and
feels that it is worthwhile for
those who participate. The
league is open to anyone in-
terested who has some soccer
experience.

“Before we started to require
some soccer experience, the
play used to get out of hand, but
you do not need to be on the var-
sity team in order to play,” said
Piranian. He added that the
championship team had only
three varsity players out of ten
members.

This year’s season began in
November and ended Monday
night in Doremus Gymnasium,
when The Dead, led by captain
Randall Ray, won the cham-
pionship of the six-team league.

“My team was tired after
playing two preliminary games
that night, but in the finals we
revived to beat a team which
played only one game before
the finals,” said Ray.

Both Ray and Piranian agree
that everyone had a lot of fun in
the league this year and en-
courage all those who enjoy
competitive soccer to give it a
try next year.

Swimmers take 3rd

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
swimming team won _ third
place at the Virginia Senior
Championships last weekend at
Virginia Tech. The Briarwood
Aquatic Club of Richmond, Va.,
was the meet champion.

The Generals swam very well
last weekend, according to
assistant coach Bob Newcomb.
The team turned in ‘‘a lot of
lifetime bests and some really
super swims,” Newcomb said.

Generals Martin Radvany
and Taber Smith contributed
outstanding performances last
weekend. Radvany’s 100-yard
breaststroke time helped
qualify W&L’s 400 medley relay
team, which can be composed
aggregately, for the NCAA Na-
tional Championships.

 

Smith qualified for the cham-

pionship heat in last weekend’s
meet in both the 50 and 100
freestyle. He swam a personal
best time in each event.

Baseball talent returns

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

With six of eight starters and
the top three pitchers from last
year returning, head baseball
coach Jim Murdock believes
that this year could be a turning
point for Generals baseball.

“‘We have the talent and the
attitude to be competitive this
year,” he said. ‘We are deep in
a number of positions, including
pitching, and we should be very
strong defensively. We also
have some talented hitters
throughout the lineup.” _

The top three returning pitch-
ers are junior Bill White,
sophomore Kirk Breen and
sophomore Peter Detlefs. Mur-
dock also sees three freshman
pitchers as contributing: Randy

Brown, Jon Thornton and Bill
Schoettelkotte.

Murdock said there is an in-
tangible aspect to the Gener-
als. “‘We have developed
a great attitude this year.
Everyone has been working
hard and everyone is primed
and ready to contribute.”’

Murdock sees_ perennial
ODAC power Lynchburg as
tough again this year.

“I think we’re as good as they
are,”’ he added. ‘‘We have to
make our own breaks this
year.”

The first baseball game of the
season is a doubleheader at
Christopher Newport Sunday
March 4. The home opener is
against VMI on Thursday,

Daly will rely on defense

By JOHN HARRISON
Staff Reporter

Coming off five preseason
scrimmages, where the Gener-
als ‘‘ran the gamut,’’ according
to head lacrosse coach Dennis
Daly, the 1984 edition of W&L
lacrosse gets under way Sunday
afternoon with a Fancy Dress
weekend tilt at Wilson Field
against interstate foe Virginia
Tech. Game time is 2 p.m.

Daly, who came to W&L after
Jack Emmer resigned in June
to take a similar position at Ar-
my, will rely on an aggressive
defense to start a fast-paced
transition for the offense. This
contrasts to Emmer’s teams,
which preferred to attack the
goal from settled situations.

“‘We’ve got to be aggressive,”
Daly said of the defense, which
will be led by senior team cap-
tain Tim Schurr and sophomore
Chris John. ‘‘We’re best when
the ball is on the ground, so we
have to be more conscious of
taking the ball away. It will set
the mood for the rest of the
team,” he added.

Along with Schurr and John,
the other starters on defense

will be senior Roland Simon and

junior Marshall Bowden. Sopho-
more Pete Braden, who played
junior varsity last year, and
freshman Bob Berlin are ex-
pected to round out the defense.

In goal, which was expected
to be a position with three
strong stoppers, the situation
has changed. John DiDuro, who
was to be the starter, was in-
jured in practice. The exact
length of his absence was not
determined. Senior Phil Aiken,
who played the first half of
Saturday’s scrimage in
Buena Vista against North
Carolina, will start while
DiDuro is out. Freshman John
Church, who finished against
UNC, will be the backup.

“I feel the most crucial posi-
tion is the goalie, and our
goaltenders are more than
capable of playing that role,”’
Daly said.

“We're looking for everyone
to carry the load,” Daly said,
“not just a couple of people.”

Junior Jeff Mason (11 goals
last season), senior Lee
Heimert (9 goals), and junior
Mark Knobloch (7 goals) are
the top returners. Daly expects
Mason and sophomore Caulley

Deringer, who along with
Junior Rod Santomassimo had
two goals against North
Carolina, to work around the
crease. Heimert and sophomore
Bill Holmes are expected to pro-
vide the hard attacks to the
goal, while Santomassimo and
sophomore Todd Breithaupt
will use the dodge to attack.

Among midfielders, junior
Rich Schoenberg will take the
majority of face-offs. Juniors
Dave Johnston, Sandy Brown
and Barry Waterman will han-
die the rest. Seniors Kevin
Walakovits and three freshmen,
Jeff Sindler, Joe Krastel and
Tim Finnerty, and _ three
sophomores up from junior var-
sity Mike McAlaine, Steve
McGrath and Scott Keith com-
plete the group that will run the
transition game.

“T get the feeling that there
was a negative feeling about
lacrosse here the last couple of
years,” Daly said. “But every-
one has worked hard in getting
to learn each other's style, and
at this point there is a lot of en-
thusiasm. We will have fun
playing and our fans will enjoy
watching us play,”’ he said.

It IS unfair to
be an athlete

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

....Y know in all this flippant
commentary stuff about these
sturdy young beings who run,
jump and play for the pleasure
of the masses — I’m talking
about the athlete, for those who
are still reading — it is so easy
to forget how derogatory the
label can be after you take
away the flashy uniforms, the
groupies, the endorsements and
the cute ‘‘Up Close and Per-
sonal’ segments. We’re at the
time of year where many
“‘athletes”’ are suiting up for the
last time, whether it be in high
school, college or some other
unknown outpost of athletic
competition. It all seems so un-
fair. The sacrifices, long hours,
setbacks and triumphs, headlin-
ed or hidden, all reduced to a
fina] lacing up of the sneakers
(skates) and riding the bench or
bowing out a champion. It
makes no difference. Tomorrow
or next week or next year,
they'll be the things that
everyone knows are missing but
no one can put their finger on.

Canfield reviews 83-84, looks to future

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee head
basketball coach Verne Can-
field is looking to the future,
perhaps a bit sooner than he
would like.

While Roanoke College is
looking forward to the NCAA
tournament after taking its
fourth consecutive Old Domi-
nion Athletic Conference cham-
pionship this week with a 93-78
victory over Catholic Universi-
ty, Canfield spent the week
recruiting players for next
year.

“Recruiting is going excep-
tionally well,” said Canfield,
whose 20-year record at W&L
stands at 324-190. ‘‘We want to
get as good a (freshman) class
as we had this year, back to
back.’

“I think we’re going to see
and hear a lot from (this year’s
freshmen) in the future, and if
we get another class like that I

think we’ve got the nucleus we

want and we'll continue winn-
ing.”

The Generals finished their
14-12 season with a 65-60 over-
time loss to Lynchburg College
Tuesday, Feb. 21, in the first
round of the ODAC tournament.

It was the last college basket-

' ball game for co-captains Chris

Baldwin and John Lee Graves.
Graves, who ended his career at
W&L seventh on the all-time
scoring list with 1441 points, has
been nominated for All-
American status.

“We just got into the situation
where we either were playing
‘not to lose’ or we were over-
reacting to officials,’ he said.

broken and we did not play
within our own system as we
had been doing previously.”’

Canfield noted from the
beginning of the season that this
year’s schedule was the
toughest any of his W&L teams
had faced. For this reason he
believes the success of the
season can not be judged on the
record alone.

“There are so many factors
here that people are overlook-
ing,” he said. “I think this is the
kind of a season where you have
to look at the positive things.”

He pointed out that this was
the team’s 17th winning season
since he’s been here. He also
noted that in free throw percen-
tage, field goal percentage and
team defense the Generals were
ranked number one in the con-
ference, in the top three of all
small colleges in the state, and
in the top 20 in the nation at one
time or another during the
season.

“I think the guys also deserve
a lot of credit for the way they
regrouped after Lex left,’ said
Canfield, referring to junior for-
ward Lex Fitzenhagen, who

was lost for the season with a
knee injury after 13 games.

Canfield noted that when the
season ended Fitzenhagen still
had the second-best scoring
average on the team.

“In other words, we didn’t
have another double-figure
scorer besides John Lee. I think
it says something about the
guys that they could do that,”
he said.

another puzzle piece that will fit

The Washington and Lee ten-
nis team will attempt to capture
its sixth ODAC title in eight
tries in the 1984 season, which
begins Friday at 3:00 with a
home match against Penn-
sylvania State University.

The varsity tennis team
features four returnees among
the top six singles players.
Craig Cannon (captain), Andy
Haring (who will be traveling
abroad during the spring term
and thus will miss the latter half
of the season), Scott Adams and
Jim Irwin return from the top
six of last year’s ODAC cham-
pionship team.

Charlie Kalocsay and Jim
Culnane also are returning
from last year’s squad, while
sophomore John Meloy and
freshmen Roby Mize and Randy
Johns are new additions to the

 

Netters open with
Div, I Penn State

varsity program.

Cannon and Mize, playing at
number one and two singles and
number one doubles, portend
good things for 1984 for the
Generals. The Intercollegiate
Tennis Coaches Association
preseason Division III rankings
have Mize ranked 35th, Cannon
2ist and the Cannon/Mize
doubles pair 12th in the country.

“‘Depthwise we are stronger
than we were last year,” head
coach Gary Franke said.

Franke believes that this
year’s team has the potential to
improve last year’s dual match
record of 7-14 and also acquire a
bid to the NCAA Division III
tournament.

Following the Penn State
match on Friday, the Generals
will play Slippery Rock on
Saturday at noon and face
Rochester, ranked eighth at the
end of last season, Monday at
3:00. Both of these are home
matches.

would favor a ‘‘White Book’’
revision that would eliminate
the statement, ‘“‘The (honor)
system applies to any conduct
considered dishonorable by the
student generation involved.”

‘Drugs should be handled in
the courts,’”’ he continued. ‘‘To
Start regulating students’ lives
beyond the boundaries of those
three areas could prove danger-
Ous,”’

“I’m worried about the honor
system,” Baumgaertner said.
Although “‘we can’t codify the
honor system,”’ he said, ‘‘we
need to redefine what con-
stitutes an honor offense.”

Jonson, who served as a
sophomore EC representative,
also said that drug matters
should be prosecuted by outside
courts, instead of ‘‘the school
doing a police number.”

“If the present generation
thinks it’s an honor violation,
then it’ll show up in the honor
trials,’’ he said.

White said that one can’t
make general statements about
honor matters, but instead has
to look at specific cases.

“T have a lot of unfinished
business with the honor sys-

tem,” he said. ‘‘I think it needs
strengthening. I think it’s
weakening.”’

A frequent theme during the
two-hour forum was that this
year’s EC had not been suffi-
ciently responsive to student
opinion.

‘What bothered me this year
was that I don’t think this year’s
Committee has represented stu-
dents as best they could,’’ White
said. ‘‘We are a representative
body. I think the students need
to have their views expressed a
little better.”’

According to White, the next
EC ‘‘needs to represent
students a lot more effectively.
That should be our main con-
cern.

“I feel I can do that because I
know a lot of students and have
a far-reaching knowledge of a
wide variety of students,’ he
said.

The responsiveness issue
focused on the EC’s proposal
that faculty members require
that ties be worn in their
classes.

“I like wearing ties,’’ said
Baumgaertner, the only one of
the three with an open collar.
‘‘But I don’t think it’s some-
thing the EC should stick its
nose into.”’

Jonson said the tie matter had
‘been blown out of proportion
by the media,” but that he

didn’t think the EC had a good
feeling for how the students
felt.”’

White said the tie proposal
started out as ‘‘a_ friendly
recommendation’ and “‘some-
thing that used positive motiva-
tion’ before it became ‘‘a big
issue.”

All of them said they favorea
retaining the finance subcom-
mittee initiated this year to
review organizations’ budget
requests before making a
recommendation to the entire
EC.

Baumgaertner said funding
requests should be considered
in light of an organization’s
size. ‘If there is great student
interest, I think it should have
funds,” he said.

Jonson said he would ex-
amine the size and impact of an
organization when determining
its student tax allocation. He
said he thinks funding should be
reduced for organizations
“which represent a single in-
terest’’ instead. of being
available to all students.

White said he had worked
closely with Vice president
Dave Judge during this year’s
budget hearings. ‘“‘This was an
especially tough and tight year,
and the subcommittee saved a
lot of time,” he said. ‘‘It was in-
valuable during the rocky road
of the budget process.”’

Open exam proposal
rejected by faculty

By DAVID W. JOHNSTON
Staff Reporter

The faculty rejected the open
exam proposal 43-42 at its Mon-
day meeting, overturning previ-
Ous approvals by the student
and faculty executive commit-
tees.

The proposal would have al-
lowed students to turn in exam
envelopes without specifying
the date or time they wished to
take the exam. Students then
could take the exam during any
period.

The proposal was amended
several times and debated for
over 45 minutes before being re-
jected, according to William
Watt, dean of the college. ‘‘It
demanded an_ inordinate
amount of time,” he said.

The faculty’s main reason for
rejecting the proposal, Watt
said, was that it was not clear
enough when exam envelopes
would be due. ‘“‘The major con-
cern was it did not seem to re-
quire students to turn [envel-
opes} in at any particular
time.”

Other faculty members op-
posed the increased freedom
the measure would have given
students, Watt said. ‘‘Some

think the students should have
to make a schedule and stick to
it.”

“I’m disappointed because I
think it would have been bene-
ficial for both the students and
faculty,’’ said Cole Dawson, the
student EC member who head-
ed the open exam committee.

Dawson said the proposal
might be considered again next
year, but ‘‘for this year it is
pretty much a dead issue.’

Whether open exams are con-
sidered next year, Dawson said,
would depend on what the facul-
tv’s final vote was. If the vote
was close it might be rein-
troduced.

“They were afraid to
change,’ Dawson said. ‘‘No-
body knows how it would work
out. I think it would have work-
ed.”

Many faculty members have
grown used to the existing
system and have their routines
‘down like clockwork,’’ he said,
making them hesitant to
change.

Dawson said if the faculty
was worried about how the
system would work, it should
have been implemented on a
trial basis

Howard resigns from EC

Secretary cites distrust, disrespect in committee

By RICK SWAGLER
Chief Editor

Student Body Secretary Len Howard resigned
at Monday night’s Executive Committee
meeting, citing excessive personal sacrifice and
an ‘‘atmosphere of distrust ... and disrespect’’ in
the EC.

Senior representative Jim Messer (who
received more votes than George Youmans, the
other Senior representative when he was
elected) took over the vacated position and
Senior Class President Charlie Alcorn assumed
the duties of senior representative.

“It’s been coming for a long, long time, and
finally what it’s boiled down to is the fact that the
academic and personal sacrifices that I had to
make to be a member of the committee were no
longer balanced by my input to the committee,”’
Howard said in an interview Monday.

“T just don’t think I'm doing anybody any
good.”’

EC President Bob Jenevein called the resigna-
tion ‘‘a complete shock to the entire committee. ”’

‘‘With all the pressure Len has been under this
year, as secretary of a highly criticized Ex
ecutive Committee, we support him and his deci
sion to remove himself. His resignation will not
prevent this committee from striving to repre
sent the students as well as possible in the next
few months,”’ Jenevein said Tuesday, reading
from a statement. .

Jenevein said he did not think it was ap-
propriate to respond to Howard’s comment that
described the committee’s atmosphere as one of
distrust and disrespect.

“It’s a highly personality-oriented issue,
Jenevein said.

Howard admits he had difficulty with the job

‘I have had some problems with the job [
don’t deny that at all — but I can’t accept full
responsibility for everything that goes wrong,”
he said.

Review and Outlook

Constitutional flaws

The resignation Monday of the student body
secretary has pointed out weaknesses in the student
government constitution stemming from its vague-
ness and ambiguity. Len Howard’s decision to leave
the Executive Committee caused confusion over the
proper procedure of succession which was finally set-
tled with the application of an elastic clause of the
consitution which permits the EC and its president to
do whatever it deems is ‘‘in the best interest of the
student body.”’

An event as major as the resignation of an Ex-
ecutive Committee officer would seem to be of such
magnitude and likelihood that it would be covered in
the constitution. But according to the new EC
parliamentarian, neither of the constitutional clauses
which approached applicability in this case were ex-
actly correct.

So the EC enacted a clause which enables it to do
almost anything it decides is proper.

We are disturbed by the problems that have been
pointed out by this episode. First, the procedure for
such a succession is not clearly addressed in the stu-
dent body constitution. And second, a clause exists
that permits an EC and its president to pass whatever
proposition it considers is best for the student body.

We do not mean to infer that this particular applica-
tion of the clause was incorrect. It may well have sav-
ed the EC and the University many complications in a
year which has already been engulfed in problems.

What we do mean to call attention to is the constitu-
tion and its spotty inadequacy. EC parliamentarian
Jim Green says the consitution is ‘‘fossilized.’’ But
with such glaring shortfalls and potentially volatile
clauses as we have discovered this week, it has be-
come vital to consider cleaning up the student body
constitution.

A consitutional ammendment requires a voted ap-
proval from two-thirds of one-half of the student body.
That alone is a major task. But, as with the White
Book, an appointed student committee aimed at ex-
amining the consitution for possible revision might be
a more practical route.

Candidates unfamiliar to students

To the Editors:

After taking part in Monday’s
“Big Three”’ elections, I began
to seriously consider just how
uninformed I had been about
each of the candidates. I realize
that some of the fault, of course,
was my own, but I believe some
of my problem was due to the
election system itself. Since we
are currently looking at the EC
and trying to determine its ex-
act role here at W&L, I think it
is paramount that we look at the
process we use to elect our EC
officers.

I think we all know that the
candidates participated in a
forum last week, a forum de-
signed to give each candidate a
chance to express his views of
the election. How many of us ac-
tually attended the forum,
though? How many of us could
honestly say we knew each of
the candidates? More impor-
tantly, how many of us knew ex-
actly what the candidates stood
for?

Certainly we saw these guys
around campus, talked to them
in class, and read about them in
the Phi. I’m just not sure that

these methods were the best
ways to judge who should be the
next EC officers. Shouldn’t
there have been more time to
campaign head-to-head? And
why were the elections put on
the Monday after Fancy Dress?
All these questions have stuck
with me since the election, and I
have a feeling I’m not the only
one asking them.

My hope is that, particularly

now — when we are looking at
the EC as a representative body
— the election procedure will
help rather than hinder the
EC’s ability to represent stu-
dent views. I certainly hope the
upcoming representative elec-
tions will be run with represen-
tation in mind.

Oxford program open

To the Editors:

I would like to draw attention
to the Virginia Program at Ox-
ford, which is a summer school
course sponsored by Washing-
ton and Lee and five other
neighboring schools. It is a uni-
que opportunity to study under
the English tutorial system at
St. Anne’s College, University
of Oxford, England. The subject
is English literature and history
of the 16th and 17th centuries,
and six semester hours are

awarded for it.

Don’t abuse our hospitahty

To the Editors:

Phi Kappa Psi does not carry
out a policy of begrudging any-
one entrance into our ‘‘sociai
events.’’ On the contrary, we
welcome almost everyone to en-
joy our ‘‘beverages,”’ bands,
and if applicable, company.
Last Saturday evening (March
3), the band “‘Steps’’ played for
our annual Fancy Dress party.
Upon the band’s completion of
their song list, a piece of their
equipment was picked up. The
piece, a light mixer, was not
discovered to be missing until
packing-up had begun. This
piece of equipment is useless to
anyone who does not have a
sophisticated light system. If
this is a fraternity prank or an

individual stab at humor, we
will consider it such, and the

piece of equipment may be .

returned with no questions ask-
ed. This is the first such inci-
dent we have encountered here
at Phi Psi. We hope that we will
not have to change our ‘‘open
arms’’ policy because of
thieves. Few, if any other
houses, had such a liberal
policy toward their Fancy
Dress festivities, and we wish to
stay as we are. I may be reach-
ed at 463-6909 and the house
number is 463-2003.
We would appreciate your
cooperation.
John B. Lewis

President of Phi Kappa Psi -

We have fewer applicants this
year than in the past and ! am
concerned that not all W&L
students may have heard of the
program. In addition, for the
first time we are able to offer a
scholarship this year (on a com-
petitive basis to those with
demonstrated need).

The total cost of the program
is $1,800, and the dates are July
2 to Aug. 10. Applications were
due by March 1, but I can ex-
tend that deadline to March 15.
Any interested students should
come to see me as soon as possi-
ble.

Although 12 area lawyers last
week called into question the
purpose and intent of the con-
troversial panel investigating
local drug trafficking, the af-
fidavit specifying prosecutor
Beverly C. “John” Read’s
reasons for requesting the
special grand jury is sealed by
court order and unavailable to
lawyers or the public.

In an unusual action, the at-
torneys formally requested that
a discussion of the special
grand jury be placed on the
agenda for Monday’s meeting
of the local bar association.

Circuit Court Judge George
E. Honts III impaneled the in-
vestigative body four months
ago after reviewing the af-
fidavit from Commonwealth’s
Attorney Read.

“There was enough in that
document to convince me that
the special grand jury was war-
ranted,” Judge Honts said.

“‘We’ve closed that just as
we've closed the transcript of
the proceedings,” he continued.
“Nothing regarding the work of
the special grand jury will be
made public until it issues its
recommendations.”’

“There may be confidential
material in there,” he said.

The judge refused to further
characterize the document, ex-
cept to say that it was ‘‘fairly
short.”

In the one-page motion which
was submitted with the detailed
proposal, Read requested that
the “affidavit be sealed pur-
suant to” two Code of Virginia
sections which make no refer-
ence to the closing of court
documents filed before the
special grand jury is convened.

One of the cited statutes deals
with the secrecy requirements
imposed on grand jurors; the
other concerns the transcript of

by Lexington Police Chief L.O.
Sutton and Rockbridge County
Sheriff S.M. Reynolds, both of
whom signed the motion.

“I signed the petition because
I felt the grand jury was need-
ed,’’ Sutton said. ‘‘I didn’t even
have toread the documents.

“‘My experience and the infor-
mation I had at the time told me
such an investigation could be
very informative.”

Reynolds said he thought that
Read was ‘‘doing a job that has
to be done,’’ and the sheriff said
that he did not need the evi-
dence submitted by the pro-
secutor to decide to lend his sup-
port to the investigation.

“If it’s an extraordinary doc-
ument, then it should be seal-
ed,’’ said -defense attorney
Larry Mann. “Tf it’s not, then

there’s no reason to close it.”’

“I have to defer to the judge
on that. It may be that it has
something so sensitive in it that
this is justified.’

Mann is one of a dozen law-
yers who last Thursday asked
Rockbridge-Buena Vista Bar
Association president J. Todd
Jones to schedule‘a discussion
of the ‘“‘manner and scope of the
special grand jury investiga-
tion’’ for Monday’s meeting.

“I think anytime you have a
group requesting that this sort
of discussion be held, they’re
obviously disturbed about
what’s happening,”’ Jones said.
“It’s obviously a highly charged
issue.”’

“In my memory, I don’t
believe an issue like this has
come up while I’ve been a
member of this bar associa-
tion,’’ he said.

“I’ve been a member of the
bar for 34 years, and I have
never known anything like this
to occur before,’’ said Bernard
J. Natkin, who said he was not
one of the attorneys who con-
tacted Jones.

The Monday luncheon meet-

the Buena Vista Motel &
Restaurant.

Several attorneys confirmed
that Read generally attends bar
association meetings.

Read has said that he will not
comment on any aspect of the
special grand jury investigation
or local reaction toit.

“Our meetings are generally
rather informal,’ Jones said.
“This element adds an air of
formality toit.”’

Attorneys question tactics of drug grand jury

He said that no action will
necessarily be taken. Following
discussion of the situation, the
bar could vote to form a com-
mittee to investigate the mat-
ter, pass a resolution, or refer
the case to a state bar associa-
tion ethics committee, among
other options.

“I would imagine that any
number of actions could come
out of it,” Jones said. “There
are no particular guidelines.

The bar can generally do what-
ever the bar wants to do. It’s
hard to speculate on what might
happen.”

Jones said that the agenda re-
quest grew out of a meeting of
the 12 attorneys last Thursday.
He said he attended the meet-
ing, but would not identify any
of the other participants.

“It was not an official bar
meeting,’ he said. “It was a

Closed party decision put off

By PETER WRIGHT
Staff Reporter

A proposal prohibiting non-
fraternity members from at-
tending fraternity parties at
Washington and Lee University
without an invitation was tabled
by the Inter-Fraternity Council,

which in turn appointed a com-

mittee to further study the
issue.

The meeting was the first to
be run by new IFC President
David Perdue, a Sigma Alpha
Epsilon senior, and Vice Presi-
dent Jim Cobb, a Phi Kappa
Sigma senior.

Perdue made the motion to
form the committee to study the
closed-party issue after extend-
ed discussion. Gary Duncan,
the newly-elected senior jus-
tice, was appointed by Perdue
to head the committee. Perdue
suggested the committee vote
on the proposal in about two
weeks.

Several other people present
at the meeting also let their
views be heard about a closed-
party policy,

One of the most vocal voices
present was that of Richard
Kopelman, who had several
suggestions to offset some of the
recent problems fraternities
are facing. Kopelman, an in-

fraternity parties be charged a
“fair” fee at the beginning of
the school year.

In regard to the over-crowded
parties, Kopelman suggested
that the size of the parties could
be limited, with independents
being the first ones asked to
leave when overcrowding oc-
curred. Kopelman added that
he didn’t think the closed party
policy would solve the problems
fraternities are experiencing.

“Better selections can be
made,” he said.

The general complaint among
the fraternities concerning the
current open-party policy in-
volves an added financial

burden and the current over-
crowding of parties.

“We need to address this pro-
blem,”’ former IFC President
Emery Ellinger said.

Dean of Fraternity Affairs
Dan Murphy said, ‘fraternities
have a right and an obligation to
control the size of parties.” He
suggested that the independents
might invest their money into
the Independent Union.

In addition, the IFC Judicial
Board fined Phi Delta Theta
$150 and issued the fraternity a
severe warning after an inci-
dent last Saturday involving
Sigma Nu and a black powder
charge.

Corrections

The Ring-tum Phi incorrectly
reported last week that the In-
terfraternity Council observed
a rule permitting only two clos-

ed fraternity parties per year.
This is not observed as a rule,
but as a tradition.

P of the constitution now
reads, ‘“‘The Executive Commit-

session except in the case of
possible honor violations.”’

“I’m going to promote a lot
more open discussion about the
issues than has been done this
year,’’ Dawson said.

“I’m so flattered I was
elected that I will do everything
in my power to see that the job
is done well, with the student

to ensure that the ad hoc
members of these committees
“really do know what’s going

Dawson said he is looking for-

Dawson garnered 470 votes to

Jewish studies professor named

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

After a one-and-a-half year
search, Washington and Lee
University has hired a Pro-
fessor of Jewish Studies. Begin-
ning with the fall term of 1984,
he will be responsible for
teaching courses in Judaism
and work as a counselor of
Jewish students. ©

Appointed to the position is
Richard G. Marks, who receiv-
ed a Ph.D. in Jewish History
from the University of Califor-
nia at Los Angeles. Marks has
been serving as a visiting pro-
fessor at Mahidol University in
Thailand since 1979 and was a
lecturer at Hebrew Union Col-
lege in Los Angeles from 1972 to
1977. He received his master’s
degree from Hebrew Union in
1971 and is a 1967 graduate of
Raymond College, where he re-
ceived a bachelor’s degree in
liberal arts.

Professor David W. Sprunt,
head of W&L’s religion depart-
ment, cites two reasons for
creating the new position. The
first is a current lack of cur-
riculum offerings in Judaism
studies and the second is the
need for a Jewish faculty
member to work with Jewish
students. The search for a per-
son to fulfill these needs began
in the fall of 1982. _

“Two people were offered it
{the job], but they declined it
primarily...because of a lack of
a Jewish community,” said
Sprunt, who said he was looking
for someone with both a
scholarly background and a
commitment to Jewish tradi-
tions. This causes ‘‘a built-in
problem,’’ considering the
Jewish community in Lex-
ington, Sprunt said.

“Marks met those two re-
quirements better than anyone
else we had,” said Sprunt,
citing Marks’ scholarly and

rabbinical training and his com-
mitment to tradition. ‘‘He has a
genuine interest in working
with the students,’’ Sprunt said.

The courses Marks will teach
were approved by the faculty
earlier this winter, before
Marks was hired. He will be
teaching classes in the Old
Testament in the fall and
winter, Introduction to Judaism
in the fall, Contemporary
Jewish Thought in the winter
and a spring seminar. Along
with Professor Harlan R.
Beckley and members of the
other departments, he will be
teaching a course in approaches
to the study of various religions,
which Sprunt considers ‘‘one of
the most interesting courses
around here.”’

While two members of the
Board of Trustees, S L Kopald
Jr. and Frances Lewis, are
Jewish, it was the faculty that
brought the idea to the Board,
which gave encouragement. “‘It
(was) not a matter of the
Trustees insisting on it,’’ Sprunt
said.

Marks has also studied at
Hebrew University Ulpan, and
was elected into Phi Kappa Phi,
the national undergraduate
honor fraternity in 1966. He is a
member of both the American
Academy of Religion and the
Association for Jewish Studies
and is the author of two articles
in scholarly publications.

Three W&L staffers in city council election

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

Three members of the W&L
community — Dr. Charles F.
Phillips Jr., Dr. Thomas C.
Imeson and Sue LaRue — have
announced during the last few
weeks that they will seek re-
election to their positions in
Lexington city government.

Clerk of Court Bruce Patter-
son said that no one other than
the incumbents has asked for
petitions to enter the at-large

‘race for City Council seats.

Phillips, who is in his 13th
year as mayor of Lexington,
will seek a fourth term in the
May 1 election. Imeson will
seek his fourth term as a
member of City Council and
Mrs. LaRue will seek her sec-
ond term.

Phillips, an economics pro-
fessor at W&L said that part of

the reason he decided to run |

for the mayor’s office again
was that no one else in the
community expressed any in-
terest in the job. .

“I waited to see if someone
would express an interest, and
no one else did. I wouldn’t be
surprised if someone decided
to run in the last couple of
days,’’ said Phillips.

Unfinished business before
the city council dealing with
such issues as annexation, the
schools,
downtown area also helped
convince Phillips to run again.

Phillips said that annexation
is probably the most important
issue before City Council at

present. Lexington is attempt-

ing to annex 6.8 square miles
of land from Rockbridge Coun-
ty.

“It is not a pleasant ex-
perience for anyone who has to
go through it. But it is the only
way that cities in Virginia can
expand,’’ Phillips said
concerning annexation.

Phillips said that he has gotten
mixed reactions from Lex-
ington residents on annexation
and generally negative reac-
tions from people in the pro-
posed annexed area. However,
Phillips said that some people
in the annexed area have cited
positive aspects of annexation.

“Annexation probably had
an impact on the number of
people running,’’ Phillips said
regarding the lack of opposi-
tion to the incumbents.

He said that he is not sur-
prised by the fact that three
members of the W&L com-
munity are running for city-
wide office. Having lived in
Lexington since 1959, Phillips
said that members of the W&L
community have always
played important roles in the
city’s public affairs.

“These two schools play an
important part in this com-
munity. They are our in-
dustry,’”’said Phillips.

Mrs. LaRue (manager of the
W&L bookstore) cited her con-
cern over annexation, educa-
tion and other issues as the
major reasons she decided to
seek a second term on City
Council.

“It’s really an exciting time
to be on City Council. We’re
right in the middle of some im-
portant projects,’’ Mrs. LaRue
said.

Mrs. LaRue said that she
hopes the city’s problem of a
limited tax base, which promp-
ted the annexation move, can
be resolved inexpensively for
everyone.

“I’m particularly concerned
with keeping the cost as low as

possible. We have a fair suit

compared to other cities who
have won annexations. Our
suit is very reasonable,’ Mrs.
LaRue said.

Mrs. LaRue also said she
thought that the annexation
fight has discouraged some
people from running for City

Council so far this year.

“I wish someone else would
run. I would like to see more
ideas expressed. The thought
that there isn’t anyone out
there to take over is discourag-
ing,”’ remarked Mrs. LaRue.

Mrs. LaRue said she is will-
ing to discuss the city or the
issues with any member of the
W&L community.

Imeson, a chemistry pro-
fessor, also mentioned the
desire to see the annexation
issue resolved as the main
reason he chose to run for a
fourth term on City Council.

“It certainly ranks among

who wanted to express their
concern on the same general
subject.”

“It’s not the special grand
jury per se that concerns the

lawyers,’’ Mann said. “It’s the »

manner in which the investiga-

tion is being conducted and the
advice the special grand jury is
getting from John Read.”’

“I think the grand jurors are
doing their job,” he continued.
“I have no qualms about the
value of the investigation. My

disagreement is purely a func-
tion of the actions of John Read.
That’s the issue that the bar is
concerned with.”’

Attorney Thomas C. Spencer
said that he was also among
those expressing displeasure
with Read’s operation of the
special grand jury.

“The way he’s doing it is

wrong regardless of how effec-

_ tive the investigation is,’’ he

said. ‘‘It seems to me irrelevant
if the special grand jury is ‘suc-
cessful.’

the most important issues,”
Imeson said, comparing an-
nexation to other issues he has
faced in 13 years on City Coun-
cil. ‘There have been other
issues which at the time were
as large.”’

Imeson said most of the peo-
ple he has talked to ‘have
adopted a wait-and-see at-
titude’’ toward the proposed
annexation.

Imeson said that running for
City Council is a low-key situa-
tion because people keep per-
sonalities and party affiliations
out of the race and concentrate
on issues. There is little cam-

paigning in a ‘‘classic sense,”
remarked Imeson.

Imeson said he thinks it is
fairly common for people

associated with colleges and
universities to play a major
role in the civic affairs of a ci-
ty. College people in Blacks-
burg, Williamsburg, Staunton
and Charlottesville play impor-
tant roles in local government,
asserted Imeson.

‘TI don’t feel that where one
finds his employment neces-
sarily indicates that he or she
represents one group com-
pared to another,” he said.

 

“If the public perceives that
he’s being successful, how
much more are they going to ac-
cept tactics like this in the next
investigation?”’

“T really don’t think that
young high school kids ought to

be pulled into a special grand
jury for the purmnse of this sort

“I’m glad

thing about it.”

Spencer said that once when
he was accompanying a client
to a special grand jury session,
Read told him before the hear-

ing to ‘‘leok out, because I’m
trying to set your client up for
perjury.”

He also said that Read has
‘misrepresented facts and the

law”’ to witnesses.

Specifically, Spencer said
Read has been telling witnesses
that they cannot discuss their
testimony, when in fact that is
not prohibited by the Code of
Virginia.

He also said that the scope of

the investigation is too broad,
and that witnesses are being
made victims of ‘‘guilt by
association.”

“TI don’t think he should be
calling in whole classes of peo-
ple,”’ Spencer said. ‘‘You don’t
issue a big widespread
dragnet.’’

“Read is ignoring his profes-
sional responsibilities,”’ he add-

said that ‘‘in no way

it be construed that
mereiy because the question
has been raised, something has
necessarily been done that’s
wrong.”

“For the bar to investigate
one of its own is common-
place,” he continued. ‘‘The
worst part of these things is that
when you’re accused, then
you’re immediately guilty in
the eyes of the public.”

“These people are making
suppositions and innuendoes
about something they don’t
have the information to
evaluate and make a decision,”’
Chief Sutton said.

“T think they’re doing more
harm than good, and they call
themselves officers of the
court.”’

Clerk of Circuit Court Bruce
D. Patterson said that when
Read was out of town on March
1, the special grand jury met
without the Commonwealth’s
Attorney for the first time.

‘Nine’ splits with Newport

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
baseball team got off to a good
start for the 1984 season by
splitting a doubleheader with
Christopher Newport College at
William and Mary College last
weekend.

In the first game, the Gener-
erals won 4-3 in extra innings
thanks to a strong pitching per-
formance by junior righthander
Billy White and freshman third
baseman Milam Turner’s
game-winning RBI in the ninth
inning.

White pitched a complete
game, striking out five and giv-
ing up only one earned run in
nine innings.

In the nightcap the Generals
fell 7-6 as Christopher Newport
scored twice in the bottom of
the seventh inning for the win.
Sophomore Kirk Breen went the
distance for the Generals in that
game. “i

Senior shortstop Dave War-
renfeltz provided most of the
Generals’ offense Sunday, col-
lecting two hits and five RBIs.

“‘T was very pleased with our

some outstanding individual
plays.

“Our pitching was very ade-
quate. White was outstanding

catcher Mike Jacoby did a

Murdock said.

Of his team’s hitting, Mur-

more runs early and late in that
game, but we were a little

The Generals host Division I

Netters fall to PSU,
down Slippery Rock

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee ten-
nis team opened its 1984 sche-
dule last weekend with a loss to
Division I Penn State but follow-
ed up with a victory against
Division II Slippery Rock.

Against Penn State the Gen-
erals were unable to post a
single match win and suffered a
9-0 loss. However, captain Craig
Cannon extended his opponent
to a second set tie breaker, and
number six sophomore Randy
Johns went three sets before
losing.

W&L head tennis coach Gary
Franke said, “They (Penn
State) had been playing indoors
for six weeks. I think that was a
big difference.” Franke added,
“I don’t think anybody played
poorly. Basically, I think we got
beat by a better team.”’

Following the Penn State loss
on Friday, the Generals re-
bounded on Saturday with a vic-
tory against Slippery Rock.
W&L won four of the six singles
matches and also posted vic-
tories in two of the three
doubles contests.

The Generals’ performance
in both matches gave Franke an
idea of his teams’ weaknesses.
Coach Franke believes that his
team needs to become more
consistent in all areas.

Franke also recognizes pro-
blems with his doubles teams.
Although Coach Franke be-
lieves that his number one
doubles team of Craig Cannon
and Roby Mize is playing well,
he is looking at many possibili-
ties as to who will play together
and at what position in the re-
mainder of the doubles line-up.

On Monday bad weather forc-
ed the Generals to cancel a
match with Division HI
powerhouse Rochester. The
teams are not likely to
reschedule the match _ this
season due to tight scheduling
by both programs.

some mistakes.’’ Daly’s main
concern was that the Generals
did not work together for most
of the first half after they built a
3-0 lead in the opening two and a
half minutes.

Lee Heimert had a hand in all
three of those goals, scoring two
and assisting for Caulley Der-
inger with a crisp pass from
behind the Tech goal. By the
time Heimert earned his fourth
and final assist of the day (on
Kevin Walakovits’ fourth goal
in the third quarter), W&L led,
11-0.

Daly was especially pleased
with Heimert’s- passing, after
the senior went without an
assist while scoring nine goals
last year. ‘‘He showed that he
can be more than a dodger,”
Daly said.

Sophomore Bill Holmes
matched Walakovits’ goal tally
with three in the third quarter,
when W&L connected 11 times
against Tech goalie Dave
Lacast, and one in the fourth.
For the game W&L outshot the
Hokies 81-23.

Money

....[t just warms my heart to
no end to hear that Steve Young
has signed with the USFL’s Los
Angeles Express for umpteen
(40) million dollars to play a
game that is probably more ex-

olds than by money-hungry.
adults. We can’t argue with
what Mr. Young chose to do.
That issue is forever beside the
point. Rather, what should be
discussed is why and how sucha
state of affairs can exist that
we, as fans, are now no longer
fazed by professional athletes’
salaries being equivalent to the
national debt of some Third

it’s a sad situation. I challenge

Time Out...

The Generals were able to
dominate possession of the ball
in large part because of the
work of Rich Schoenberg, who
won all but four of the 25
faceoffs. ‘He showed some ver-
satile moves,” Daly said of
Schoenberg’s performance.

On the few occasions the
Hokies got across midfield, the
best they could manage were
routine shots on Phil Aiken, who
recorded 13 saves.

Tech’s best chances to get on
the board came in the second
quarter. Hokie Defenseman
Doug Politi scooped up a loose
ball at the crease of the W&L
goal and had only Aiken to beat
but was thwarted by the pipe.

Later, with Aiken caught out
of the crease on a failed attempt
to clear, W&L’s Barry Water-
man preserved the shutout by
hitting Ken Dyke’s stick as
Dyke was winding up to shoot at
the empty goal. Waterman
eventually ended the scoring in
the first half after making two
dodges through the defense.

(continued from page 1)

In his letter of resignation,
Howard said, ‘‘I have been forc-
ed to work in an atmosphere of
distrust for my abilities and
disrespect for my opinions. I
have been forced to com-
promise my personal convic-
tions for the sake of a ‘united
front’ and no longer feel com-
fortable expressing my own
ideas, much less those of the
students I have tried to repre-
sent. I have grown increasingly
frustrated with my inability to
express what I deem to be valid
student sentiments and I find
that my contributions to the
committee have steadily
decreased, both in the impor-
tance given them and in their
general reception.”

Howard’s_ resignation also
caused some confusion as to
who would replace Jim Messer

Senior law _ representative
Jim Green, appointed parlia-
mentarian at a special EC
meeting Tuesday night, called
the constitution a ‘‘very fossil-
ized document.”

According to Green, the
senior law representative has
traditionally acted as a
parliamentarian in keeping the
committee abreast of matters
of constitution and order.

“‘What we are doing in seating
Charlie Alcorn is 100 percent
within the spirit of the student
constitution,”’ he said.

“Our intent was allowing stu-
dent government to continue,”’
he said. Section V, Part F, in the
constitution provides for the
replacement of “student body
officers and all positions of
honor’’ through a special elec-
tion.

“I do not specifically see ‘all
positions of honor’ directly to
refer to these (representative)
positions,” Green said.

Class President to take over the
duties of the senior class
representative should that
representative leave ‘‘the
University during the six-week
term.”

“It was our collective best
judgment that this was the pro-
per procedure to follow at this
time. I find that (Section V,

sive and I agree that (Section V,
Part I) is not directly respon-
sive,” Green said.

“‘We are following the plan of

tion III Part A Number 4,” he
said.

Section III, Part A, Number 4
provides for the President to
“do anything necessary to pro-
mote the best interests of the
Student Body,” provided the
rest of the committee approves.

At the Tuesday night meet-
ing, the committee voted unani-
mously to empower Jenevein to
follow the plan set up in Part I,
whereby Alcorn takes Messer’s
position.

speak unequivocally to this un-
fortunate situation. The word-
ing is open to interpretation,”

Dalton and White
elected in runoffs

Posters cause election controversy

By G. BRUCE POTTER

Sophomore James White was
elected Executive Committee
vice president and junior Sam
Dalton secretary during last
Thursday's ‘‘Big Three’ run-
offs.

The election was not without
controversy, though. Despite
complaints from the law school
during Monday night’s two-and-
a-half hour EC meeting regard-
ing the activities of temporary
Voting Regulations Board co-
chairman Jim Green, upper-
class law representative to the
EC, the EC voted to stand
behind the election results.

Committee votes to keep 12-12-6

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

The faculty calendar commit-
tee voted Friday to retain the
12-12-6 undergraduate academ-
ic calendar but to recommend
several changes to President
Wilson and the faculty as a
whole.

After voting 7-1 to keep the
12-12-6, the committee voted to
extend class periods five
minutes to 55 minutes each, to
establish a one-week vacation
after six weeks of the fall term
and to require returning
students to register for the en-
tire following academic year in
the preceding spring.

The committee delayed until
tomorrow action on whether to
eliminate or shorten the one-
week Thanksgiving vacation. A
motion was made to eliminate
the break, and “‘it’s my opi-

nion... that it would have pass-
ed,’’ said senior Lee Feldman, a
student representative to the
committee. Feldman managed
to have action delayed for a
week so he could appear before
the Executive Committee Mon-
day night and attempt to
discern student body opinion.

The EC voted 10-01, with
junior representative Cole
Dawson abstaining, to support a
week-long Thanksgiving vaca-
tion.

Feldman and the other stu-
dent representative, Rob
Woods, conducted a poll of
students Feb. 20-24. Of the 165
responses, Feldman said, 140
students favored the 12-12-6, 19
opposed it and six had no opi-
nion.

The EC voted to conduct
another poll on all proposed
calendar changes in conjunc-

tion with class elections Mon-
day.

About 70 percent of the facul-
ty surveyed last term also
favored the 12-12-6, Feldman
said.

One of the major faculty com-
plaints about the current calen-
dar is that classes don’t meet
often enough, Feldman said.
The lengthening of classes to 55
minutes would effectively add
another three class periods onto
the term.

Classes would begin every
hour on the hour and end at five
minutes until the hour. The last
class, which is now ‘‘J’’ hour,
would end at 5:55 p.m.

The committee voted to add
the October week vacation
because, Feldman - said,
“students, they felt, needed a
break after six weeks, especial-
ly freshmen.”

‘“! didn’t think a week was

necessary,’’ Feldman added. ‘‘I
thought a three-day weekend or
a four-day weekend would be
sufficient. The faculty felt a
week would be better because it
would give them more time to
work on mid-term grades.”’

When Feldman told the EC of
the October break and the
possibility of eliminating
Thanksgiving vacation,
Dawson said, ‘‘That’s ridicu-
lous. It’s not a state school, and
people come from so far away. I
think under the present system,
we have too many breaks.”’

Having voted to recommend
the October break, the commit-
tee had to either shorten
Thanksgiving break or decide
to start classes earlier or finish
them later, Feldman said. ‘‘The
Thanksgiving break is needed
but not necessarily a week-long
break,’ he added.

law representative last year,
said many law students were
upset about a letter White used
in campaigning on the under-
graduate campus and about
Green's involvement in taking
down copies of that letter posted
in the law school by someone in
opposition to White.

‘‘T don’t think he (Green) has
shown himself to be indepen-
dent,”’ Sicilian said. ‘You peo-
ple failed to discharge your du-
ty to get someone who was in-
dependent,’ he added, refer-
ring to the EC’s inability to ob-
tain a VRB chairman to replace
Burns Newsome, who is not at
Washington and Lee this
semester.

Law student Jeff Reese and
freshman Chris Carter were
named VRB co-chairmen by the
EC Monday night.

In the meantime, though,
Green and secretary Jim
Messer had been designated co-
chairmen of the VRB. When this
was announced two weeks ago,
Pete Baumgaertner, White’s
opponent in the runoff, pro-
tested, saying Green had been
campaigning in the law school
for a particular candidate and
that his presence at the polls
would remind voters -of that
candidate.

At that meeting, Green pro-
mised, ‘‘From this point on, |
can assure you I will be totally
oblivious, or neutral, to the pro-
ceedings.”

“IT believe I remained objec-
tive,’ Green asserted Monday
night.

“T don’t believe you did,”
responded Sicilian in what was
at times a heated exchange

Sicilian based his complaints
on the fact that Green took
down Xeroxed copies of White’s
letter that were posted in the
law school. White said he did

Review and Outlook

The Lure of Change

The primary purpose of the faculty calendar com-
mittee, formed last fall, was to study the effec-
tiveness of the undergraduate calendar and to recom-
mend potential changes to the rest of the faculty.

After concluding, and rightly so, that Washington
and Lee should retain its unique 12-12-6 calendar with
the short spring term, the faculty committee ap-
parently couldn’t resist the lure of change.

As reported to the student Executive Committee
Monday night, these changes range from the sensible
to the ludicrous. At the former end of that spectrum is
the proposal to extend classes to 55 minutes each. At
the latter is the proposal to require students to attend
classes Thanksgiving week, and, even worse, on
Thanksgiving Day. It is indeed alarming that one pro-
fessor even suggested a University-wide Thanksgiv-
ing dinner.

While we are disturbed that the faculty sees any
need to change the calendar, we do understand the
need for longer class periods, a brief break in the mid-
dle of October and perhaps a shortened Thanksgiving
vacation.

With this in mind, we support the plan suggested at
Monday’s EC meeting that student representative

_ Lee Feldman has said he intends to present to the
‘faculty committee tomorrow. This would call for no
' classes on the Monday and Tuesday following the
sixth week of school in the fall and no classes on the
Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of Thanksgiving
week.

The two days in the middle of October would pro-
vide professors a chance to work on mid-term grades
and give students a breather from the rigors of
academic work. Ten weeks without break, which
students face under the present calendar, is a long
time, particularly for freshmen.

Shortening the Thanksgiving break to three days
and a weekend, meanwhile, would allow students who
so desired to go home for the holidays and also would
eliminate the seeming waste of a week’s vacation so
close to Christmas.

This faculty committee seems to have taken stu-
dent opinion into account when deciding to recom-
mend keeping the 12-12-6 calendar. We hope it does
not act with too much haste and continues to keep stu-
dent opinion in mind when considering these other
calendar issues.

Juan Valdez needs you

To the Editors:

The situation in Nicaragua is
extremely critical at this time.
The Nicaraguan economy
which depends heavily on only a
few agricultural exports has
been under increasing attack
from CIA-backed counter-
revolutionaries. Several hun-
dred million dollars worth of
damage has already resulted
from attacks such as the one
against the vital oil storage
facilities at the port of Corinto
last October.

Nicaragua needs a successful
coffee harvest to be able to pur-
chase basic food stuffs,
medicines, spare parts for in-
dustry and transportation, and
oil. Because of the urgent
political and military situation,
many Nicaraguans have been
mobilized in the defense of their
country and cannot participate
in the December-February cof-
fee harvest this year.

That is why I have chosen to

respond to Nicaragua’s call for
international work brigades to
ensure a _ successful coffee
harvest this year.

_ In the United States, the Na-
tional Network in Solidarity
with the Nicaraguan People
(NNSNP) is working to coor-
dinate volunteer participation.
U.S. citizens have a particular
role in this harvest, because if it
were not for our government’s
open attempts to overthrow the
government of Nicaragua, the
Nicaraguans would be free to
develop their own political life
and their own economy in
peace.

By participating in the
volunteer coffee harvest, I hope
to show that, as an American
citizen, I stand with the people
of Nicaragua in their moment of
need and that I oppose the
policies of the Reagan ad-
ministration. I urge others to
support and write to NNSNP for
further information on how to

Phi Delt member
responds to rumor

To the Editors:

In a recent letter to the SAC
from Sigma Nu concerning the
Fancy Dress weekend bombing
of their house, the members of
Sigma Nu referred to Phi Delt
as not being able to discipline
its members. They referred to
the incident as_ potentially
dangerous and they found a
lack of maturity, discipline, and
gentlemanly conduct among the
members of Phi Delt. Although
I agree on the lack of maturity
of those involved and the poten-
tial danger of this act, I
adamantly disagree with the
accusation of not being able to
discipline members. The acts of
a few in this case are not
representative of the majority.
The members of Sigma Nu
seem to think that Phi Delt took

a vote on this guerilla act of war.

at a house meeting.

To get to the point of this let-
ter, I would like to clarify one
point. In no way was I involved

in the.occurrence last weekend
at Sigma Nu, although’ my
name was brought up by some
Sigma Nu super-sleuth as hav-
ing stolen the simulator from
ROTC. I would not mind so
much if someone had been
enough of a man (or gentle-
man) to confront me with these
accusations.

Until the members of Sigma
Nu can discipline themselves
and rise to the level of maturity
and gentlemanly conduct that
they expect of everyone else, I
suggest that they take a long
look at themselves before con-
demning others.

In closing, I have some
guidelines for the members of
Sigma Nu: 1) A man is innocent
until proven guilty, 2) Get the
facts first - Perry Mason is just
a TV show, 3) Leave the rumors
to the National Enquirer, 4)
Grow up.

- Lawyers outline grand jury witness rights

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

Local lawyers adopted a
resolution Monday that outlines
the rights of witnesses who ap-
pear before the special grand
jury investigating area drug
trafficking.

The Rockbridge County-
Buena Vista Bar Association
also voted to name a five-
member committee to study
“‘the orderly administration of
justice in Rockbridge County.’’

The actions follow complaints
from a number of Lexington at-
torneys concerning Com-
monwealth’s Attorney Beverly
C. ‘John’ Read’s operation of
the special grand jury, which is
now in its fifth month.

The panel’s 18th session is to
be held tomorrow. A Hollins
College student and two
students from Southern
Seminary Junior College are
among those scheduled to
testify.

The resolutions were approv-
ed during a three-hour private
meeting held at a: Buena Vista
restaurant.

Bar association president J.

Todd Jones said Monday after
the meeting that 20-25 members
attended, including Read, who
was present for the entire ses-
sion

Read has said that he will not
comment on any aspect of the
special grand jury.

Monday afternoon’s session
of Circuit Court was delayed
because of the length of the
lawyers’ meeting. The judge,
clerk, bailiffs, defendants and
their witnesses all sat idly in the

‘‘We didn’t have any law-

Patterson.

Jones said that the resolu-
tions were ‘‘the collective effort
of the unofficial group that has
been meeting and discussing’’
the special grand jury.

It was that group of 12
lawyers which had formally
asked Jones to place discussion
of the investigative panel on
Monday’s agenda.

Jones said that the informa-
tion regarding the rights of
those subpoenaed by the special
grand jury was being dissemi-
nated ‘‘to straighten up the con-
fusion”’ about the panel.

The resolution said the bar
association was delineating the
legal principles ‘‘in order to
fulfill its obligation to inform
the public on this issue.”

‘*...Members of the Bar have
received inquiries from citizens

pretations of certain pro-
cedures employed by the

Committees help solve financial problems

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

The Student Financial Rela-
tions Committee, better known
as the ‘‘cold check committee,”
and the Student Loan Commit-
tee assist students at Washing-
ton and Lee in meeting financial
problems. While very little
media coverage has been given
to them so far, both committees
are important in maintaining a
strong financial understanding
between W&L students and Lex-
ington merchants.

“The Committee pretty much
makes loans to those students
who find themselves in emer-
gency situations,’’ said Charlie
Sherrill, Chairman of the Stu-
dent Loan Committee. This
year, 28 students have received
a total of $2,505 in loans from
Sherrill.

The cold check committee,
which is only related to the Stu-
dent Loan Committee in that
they both report to the Ex-
ecutive Committee, is responsi-
ble for paying checks bounced
by students. In describing the
purpose of the cold check com-
mittee, Chairman Gil Dukes ex-
plained, ‘‘If it wasn’t for us, the
merchants would be a little
more hesitant about taking
checks from W&L students.”’

When a bank returns a stu-
dent’s check to a local mer-
chant, the merchant will submit
the check to the bank a second
time. If the check is again
returned, it is mailed to the
University, Dukes explained.

Every Wednesday, Dukes and
the other nine members of his
committee go through the re-
turned checks, which have been
written to local merchants.
From the Committee’s own
checking account, which is
totally independent from the
University, the merchants are
repayed, and the students are
called in to appear before the
committee, according to Dukes.

“We probably go through
about ... 10 people every Wed-
nesday night,’’ said Dukes.
‘Sometimes they skip the meet-
ings. If it is an unexcused
absence, we’ll fine them more,”
he continued.

During a student’s tenure at
W&L, a file of his appearances
before the committee is main-
tained. For an offense that is
not the student’s fault, such asa
bank error, there is no fine.
Otherwise, a student may be
fined up to ten dollars for the
first offense, twenty for the se-
cond appearance, and thirty for
the third, Dukes said. ‘‘We use
our judgment,’ said Dukes. The
committee discusses and votes
on each fine.

One of the committee’s big-
gest problems is dealing with
students who have overdrawn
their accounts and and left
school, Dukes said. The com-
mittee now has about 50 checks
from such students. ‘‘We’ve got
a hold on their transcripts,”
says Dukes in reference to these
students. ‘“‘If they need their
grades, they must pay us.”’

Students who continually

refuse to appear before the
committee are sent to the Stu-
dent Control Committee. ‘Only
one time this year have we had
to send them to Student Con-
trol,” says Dukes. Student Con-
trol may threaten students with
suspension and normally will
impose an additional fine.

While the Student Financial
Relations’ checking account
becomes larger and smaller ac-
cording to the time of the year,
it has not received any EC
money this year, according to
Dukes.

While the Committee does
cover for checks overdrawn by
students, it does not pay fines
charged by the bank.

“Some merchants don’t deal
with us because we don’t pay
fines,’’ said Dukes, who cited
one merchant who expected two
dollars for an overdrawn check,
plus $10 for the bank’s service
charge, which the committee
would not pay. According to
Dukes, most merchants try to
straighten out the situation with
the student before contacting
the committee.

The Student Loan Committee,
in contrast to the cold check
committee, does receive EC
funds and works through the
business office. According to
Sherrill, loans are usually for 30
days with a $300 maximum
limit. All loans are interest free.

“I’d say we have a pretty
good turnover rate,’’ says Sher-

rill, whose committee currently
has 18 outstanding loans. Of
these, seven are overdue from
last academic year, four are
overdue from this school year,
and the remaining seven are not
yet due, for a total of $2,291
outstanding.

“Of the 11 overdue, eight of

them are on campus,”’ says.

Sherrill, who has run into the
same problems as Dukes con-
cerning students who have left
the school.

“For those loans that have
been past due for a while ... I
have the authority to put a hold
on their transcripts,” says
Sherrill. This is normal policy
any time a student leaves the
school before paying any money
due.

According to Sherrill, loans
are based on emergency situa-
tions such as a_ student’s
needing money to pay a heating
bill. Sherrill noted one instance
where a student’s ROTC check
didn’t come in, and the student
needed money for the month.

While Sherrill has had to turn
down some loan requests, there
have not been any complaints
about the committee this year.
There is nothing in writing that
could hold down the credit
rating of students who have
received loans, according to
Sherrill. Thus, there are no
limitations on how a student
who has received a loan spends
the money he has.

because revelations regarding
the use of cocaine could involve
federal statutes.

eThe transcripts of the ses-
sions ‘‘are for the sole use of the
Special Grand Jury” and must
be kept sealed. They cannot be
opened except in the event of a
perjury prosecution.

eThe report filed by the
spécial grand jury at the con-
clusion of the investigation ‘‘is
sealed and not open to public in-
spection other than by order of
the Court.”

*The protection received
from a grant of immunity ‘‘may
be totally dependent on the con-
tent of the record’’ kept of the
session. Witnesses ‘‘should be
certain that all of their com-
ments are being properly noted
and recorded.”’

e‘‘Before a person can be held
in contempt for failure to
answer a question, he is entitled
to a hearing before a Judge.”’ If
the question is upheld but the
judge ‘‘finds the refusal to
answer was reasonable, the
witness is usually given an op-
portunity to give the answer”’
without penalty.

The resolution, which Jones
describes as being ‘‘educational
in nature,’’ does not address the
issue of whether the Virginia
immunity statutes applying
specifically to drug investiga-
tions are applicable to the
special grand jury.

“That is such a complicated
issue that no one was willing to
bring up that question,” said at-
torney Larry Mann. ‘‘The law
hasn’t been tested, or tested
enough, for us to be comfortable
saying exactly what the law is.”’

The second resolution passed
by the bar Monday directs
Jones to appoint a committee of
five members of the bar to
prepare a report and recom-
mendations.

The purpose of the committee
is ‘‘to settle the apprehension
and controversy and to promote
respect for the law and the
equal enforcement of the law.”’

The special grand jury is not
mentioned by name in the
resolution.

The committee is directed to
consult with members of the
bar, law enforcement person-
nel, the courts and citizens in
preparing the report.

Jones said he has not yet
selected the committee and
declined to specify a time frame
for the likely submission of the
report.

In last Thursday’s session the
special grand jury heard
testimony from officials of state
agencies and drug rehabilita-
tion programs.

The witnesses came from
Richmond, Roanoke, Win-
chester and Annandale. Includ-
ed were state Deputy Attorney
General Donald C. J. Gehring
and a member of the staff of
Gov. Charles S. Robb.

Phi Delts penalized for Sigma Nu incident

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

An incident involving two Phi
Delta Theta sophomores and
the throwing of an artillery
simulator at the Sigma Nu
house on March 3 has resulted
in two weeks’ social probation
for Phi Delta Theta and several
additional penalties for the
students involved.

Dean of Students Lewis G.
John confirmed that the two
students have received four
weeks of social probation and
will not be allowed to live in the
fraternity house during spring
term.

They also must pay to repair
damages caused to the Sigma
Nu house, make a personal at-
tempt to repair the damages
and make a personal apology to
the members of the Sigma Nu
house.

A member of the Student Con-
trol Committee, which deter-
mined the punishments against
the individuals Tuesday night,

confirmed that the two students
were Frank Surface and James
White.

White is a sophomore repre-
sentative to the Executive Com-
mittee and the vice president-
elect of next year’s EC.

The SCC member said the in-
dividual penalties were ‘‘proba-
bly the harshest thing we could
do short of suspension. I con-
sider it a pretty stiff penalty.”

Although Surface said he
thought the SCC decision ‘‘was
a little too harsh,” he added,
“I’m accepting my _ punish-
ment.”

White was unavailable for
comment.

Phi Delta Theta, meanwhile,
was fined $150 by the Inter-
fraternity Council March 6 and
given two weeks of social proba-
tion by the Student Affairs Com-
mittee on March 9.

The SAC, which automatical-
ly reviews all IFC Judicial
Board decisions, ‘‘felt the ac-
tion involved a greater penalty

for the fraternity than the IFC
recommended,”’ said John, who
is chairman of the SAC.

“Sigma Nu wrote a memo
outlining their position and
their feeling that some stronger
penalty should be ascribed,”
John added.

Phi Delta Theta could have
appealed the penalties to the
SAC at its meeting yesterday
afternoon but chose not to do so,
according to President Rey-
nolds Thompson, because ‘‘we
just wanted to lay the issue to
rest.”

According to information
gathered from various wit-
nesses and from a report filed
with the Lexington Police
Department, the incident oc-
curred about 5:30 p.m. Satur-
day, March3.

James Farquhar, a fresh-
man, said he was picking up
beer cans from Sigma Nu’s
front yard when he saw the ar-
tillery simulator thrown from
the front yard of the Phi Delta
Theta house.

The simulator, a cylindrical
object that creates smoke and
noise and is used by the military
to simulate battlefied condi-
tions, landed about five to 10
feet away from him, Farquhar
said, and rolled about 10 to 12
yards away before exploding.

Kearup said the shock from
the explosion broke two window
panes, damaged a window sill
and knocked some plaster loose

from the Sigma Nu house.

Some members of Sigma Nu
went over to the Phi Delta
Theta house immediately after-
ward, Bearup said, and the
members of Phi Delta Theta of-
fered to pay for the damage.

Bearup also called the Lex-
ington Police Department. Sgt.
Richard S. Rice, who answered
the call, said he wanted the
fraternities to settle the issue
between themselves, according
to Bearup.

Chris John, president of
Sigma Nu, said that Surface
came to the Sigma Nu house the
following night to apologize for
the incident and that Phi Delta
Theta paid $50 toward the
damages then. John said the
damages will amount to more
than that.

Farquhar said he suffered
some ringing in his ears follow-
ing the incident, but that it went
away. He went to the W&L in-
firmary to ensure that there
was no permanent damage.

“Looking back at it,’’ Far-
quhar said, ‘“‘they apparently
didn’t know I was standing
there (when the simulator was
thrown).”’

Surface said he _ thought
everybody had gone inside the
Sigma Nu house before the
simulator was thrown.

Lt. Col. David Fowler, chair-
man of the W&L military
science department, said an ar-
tillery simulator, about four
inches long and one inch wide,
could cause injury if it came in-
to contact with someone be-
cause there would be danger of
a “flash burn’’ caused by the
heat generated.

Although the W&L ROTC unit
uses them on training opera-

tions to simulate mortar or ar-
tillery fire, Fowler said, they
are only issued to the cadre (ac-
tive officers) and a selected
group of seniors trained in their
use. Up to 60 artillery simula-
tors could be issued for a two-
day exercise, Fowler said, and
the unused ones are returned.

Based on the federal stock
number of the simulator used in
the incident, ‘‘we have unof-
ficially determined that this one
did not come from us,’’ Fowler
said.

John, who said he talked with
both students last week, said,
‘‘My understanding is that it
was purchased out of state
some place.”

Lexington Police Chief L.O.
Sutton said Rice filed a report
on the incident late last week.

Sutton said that unless Sigma
Nu wanted to press charges,
that would be the extent of the
police department’s involve-
ment.

“My investigation is com-
plete. There’s nothing further
for me todo,”’ he added.

Chris John said Sigma Nu
would decide at a _ house
meeting Sunday whether to
take further action against
either Phi Delta Theta or the in-
dividuals.

John said he personally was
satisfied with the SAC decision
but that ‘‘there are mixed reac-
tions to it’’ and the SCC decision

among the other house
members.
The SCC deliberated for about

an hour before making a deci-
sion Tuesday night, said the
member, who added, “The
police consideration was men-
tioned a couple of times.... It
weighed on everybody’s mind.”’

From lowa State to W&L

‘I can't imagine anything better happening to me.

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

John W. Elrod, recently
chosen as Washington and Lee’s
next Dean of the College, says
he is ‘‘not going to come as a
dean with an agenda.”

Elrod, 44, who heads the
philosophy department at Iowa
State University in Ames, Iowa,
will succeed William J. Watt on
Aug. 1.

In a_ telephone interview,
Elrod said he plans to spend his
first year at W&L “really
familiarizing myself with the
University’s program and with
faculty needs and problems.”

“Only then will I begin work-

ing with faculty and students on
any changes that might come
up,” he said.

‘“‘The best administrators are
those who work with a situation
in concrete terms,” he con-
tinued. ‘‘Right now my
knowledge of the school is very
abstract.”

‘“‘The main responsibility of
an administrator is maintaining
and enhancing the quality of the
institution he serves,’’ Elrod
said.

‘‘The way I see my role as an
administrator is to help the
faculty do its job, and to main-
tain the teaching and research
quality of the institution.”

‘An effective administrator
creates an environment in
which it is possible to work
closely with the faculty and to
cooperate with them,” he add-
ed.

‘“‘As far as I know, Washing-
ton and Lee is in very good
financial shape,’’ Elrod said in
discussing key issues that face
the school.

‘Washington and Lee has to
decide what it wants to do about
coeducation. As soon as it gets
that out of the way, I don’t see
any major problems in the near
future.”’

Elrod, who has visited Lex-

y)

Our warm hand
of service
is aphone call away

ington twice in the last year,
called W&L ‘‘an institution of
enormous quality.”

“What attracted me most
about Washington and Lee was
working for an institution of
such distinction and with such
outstanding faculty and stu-
dents,”’ he said.

He added that he is “‘very im-
pressed”’ by President John D.
Wilson, and that he is looking
forward to working with him.

“IT wish I could express the
thrill and excitement I have
about coming to Washington
and Lee,” he said. ‘‘It is, profes-
sionally, the most exciting mo-
ment of my life. I can’t imagine
anything better happening to
me.’

Elrod said President Wilson
offered him the position in early
January, and that he formally
accepted it two weeks later.

“‘T had pretty much made up
my mind after we left after our
second trip there,” he said.
“But I wanted to think about it
in the context of it actually be-
ing a real offer.

‘“‘The same positive feelings
we had initially came back at
that time. I accepted with
tremendous happiness.”’

Elrod said that coming to
W&L brings him back to his
roots ‘‘in two very definite
senses’? — one geographical,
the other professional.

Raised in Griffin, Ga., Elrod
said he’s always considered
himself a Southerner. Since
then he’s lived in a number of
areas.

‘‘We’ ve had a strong desire to
return to the South,’’ he said.

The other reason that Elrod
said he considers his new post a
homecoming is that he’ll be
returning to a small college.

He received his undergradu-
ate training at Presbyterian
College in Clinton, S.C., which
currently has a student body of
950.

“‘T’ve never forgotten that ex-

 

CANCER
¥ ANSWER
¢ SERVICE

a eae eo

perience,” he said. ‘Having
seen what the other side of the
fence looks like, I’ll be glad to
return to my _ educational
roots.”” (Iowa State has just
under 25,000 students. )

He completed his master’s
and doctoral work at Columbia
University in New York, which
has an enrollment of 18,500.

“At a state university, you
have good students, but you
don’t have the uniform high
quality in the student body that
you do at a_ school like
Washington and Lee,’ he
stated.

“On a campus like Washing-
ton and Lee’s, you work in an
environment that is more
manageable. At a large institu-
tion, it is very difficult to set at-
tainable goals.’”’

Elrod said his main regret in
leaving Iowa State is that he’s
going to miss his former col-
leagues.

“Towa has been very in-
strumental in my development
as a philosopher and as an ad-
ministrator,’’ he added.

The dean-elect is an expert on
the 19th century Danish
religious philosopher Soren
Aabye Kierkegaard. Two of
Elrod’s books on that writer
have been published by Prince-
ton University Press.

Kierkegaard is regarded as
one of the founders of existen-
tialism, the philosophy profess-
ed by writers from Jean-Paul
Sartre to Norman Mailer.

In his writings, Kierkegaard
emphasized the concepts of the
individual, of choice, of dread
and of paradox, all of which are
said to be fundamental themes
of existentialism.

Elrod said he was ‘‘extremely
impressed” with Kierkegaard
the first time he read the
author, and found the writing
‘‘compelling.”’

“I saw he was concerned with
the same problems I was,”’
Elrod recalls. ‘‘He was some-

1-800-552- 7996

Dean-elect John W. Elrod

thing of a philosophical soul-
mate.”

In 1975, Elrod published ‘‘Be-
ing and Existence in Kierke-
gaard’s Pseudonymous
Works.” In a review, Choice
magazine said that it was ‘‘an
important but specialized book
on the thought of Kierkegaard,
the ‘father of existentialism.’ ”’

Elrod’s more recent book,
published in 1981, is titled
“Kierkegaard and Christen-
dom.”’

A Library Journal appraisal
said, ‘“‘Elrod’s fluent approach
and his inclusion of appropriate
background make this study
valuable to both new and knowl-
edgeable Kierkegaard stu-
dents.”

It said the work ‘‘belongs in
most philosophy and religion
collections.”

The dean-elect said he’s going
to shift his focus away from
Kierkegaard and bring himself
“up-to-date on contemporary

‘French and German _philoso-

phers.”’

“My scholarly life will now be
given over to reading in that
area,’’ he said.

Elrod called himself an
“avid’’ tennis player, and said
he jogs 20-30 miles a week.

He also said he’s a ‘‘budding
ornithologist” and a “‘lover of
music.”

‘Although I don’t play an in-
strument, I’m an avid concert
and theater-goer,’’ he said.

On his visits, he has admired
the ‘19th century colonial
America look which Lexington
rather self-consciously main-
tains.’”’

‘I like that very much,’’ he
said. ‘‘It pleases me no end.”’

Elrod and his wife, Mimi, who
has a Ph.D. in child develop-
ment, plan to move to Lex-
ington on July 15. They have
two children, Adam, 15, and
Joshua, 12.

Will Gary leave his Hart in San Francisco?

By MIKE ALLEN

A funny thing happened on
the way to the coronation.

Guess who’s not laughing?

Yes, Walter, there is a nomi-
nating process, and no, you
don’t get a non-stop ticket to
San Francisco.

Mondale’s campaign has
been on the fritz ever since
Gary Hart’s “upset’’ in New
Hampshire. Supporters of the
former vice president had
nightmares about ‘“‘Super Tues-
day,” with visions of HART-
MAN gobbling up all of Mon-
dale’s delegates.

That didn’t happen, though
—Tuesday was neither super
nor disastrous for either can-
didate. As far as what’s next,
the future is certain to be as un-
predictable as the past.

“It’s going to be a marathon
all the way to California,’’ Mon-
dale said Tuesday night.

“One of us will have this race
wrapped up by the middle part
of this process — in the next 30
days,” Hart said Wednesday.

 

Mike Allen is a political
analyst for the Mock Con-
vention.

No one is sure. That’s why the
Mock Convention ran into a lit-
tle trouble last week when it
presented its very highly
educated guesses in starkly
tabular form.

The Mock Convention predic-
tors (including, admittedly, this
reporter) didn’t issue a state-
ment which said, “Dewey Beats
Truman,”’ but at first glance, it
seemed to be almost that bad.

The truth is that, taken as a
whole, the predictions were no
wider of the mark than anyone
else’s, and were based on much
better information. Hart didn’t
take Alabama, and he was
stronger than expected in a few
of the caucuses, but there were
sound reasons for each of the er-
rors (a moral victory? ).

A columnist in the Roanoke
paper, commenting on the
predictions, wrote Wednesday
morning that ‘‘if the students
were right, nobody on the day
after Super Tuesday has a sure
grip on the nomination.” By
that standard, the trend iden-
tified by the Mock Convention
researchers was right on
target.

Perhaps the most reliable
method of accurately prediet-

ing the outcome of these races
is one offered facetiously by
William Buchanan, head of the
W&L politics department.

“Hart tends to win in places
where it snows, and Mondale is
strong in places that it rains,”’
he said Wednesday. ‘‘Maybe we
should have the candidates
come out of their holes every
Tuesday, see if they see their
shadow, and then we’d know
what was going to happen.”’

The next battleground for the
four underdogs is ‘“‘Super Satur-
day,” a day on which 356
delegates are at stake, in-
cluding 155 from the important
state of Michigan.

The following Tuesday is the
Illinois primary (194 dele-
gates), and it’s possible that
that contest will be the decisive
lap in the Hart-Mondale vote-a-
thon.

Network exit polling Tuesday
indicated that if Glenn were to
withdraw (and that is possible
— likely, even — as soon as to-
day), Hart would pick up con-
siderable strength from Glenn’s
former supporters. That could
turn the tide in Illinois, where
Mondale is the current favorite.

In the days between “Super
Tuesday” and Saturday, Mon-
dale was scheduled to cam-
paign exclusively in Illinois and
Michigan. Hart will add Arkan-
sas to those two, and Jesse
Jackson will make appearances
in South Carolina, as well as the
other three states.

It’ll be interesting to watch
Hart in Michigan explaining his
vote against the Chrysler bail-
out and Mondale in Illinois
passifying the farmers who
were severely hurt by the

Carter Administration’s grain

embargo of the U.S.S.R.

(If Mondale was as close to
the center of the action as
George Bush is, he probably
didn’t know about it until he
read about it in the morning
paper, anyway.)

On the Sunday before ‘Super
Tuesday,” there were some in-
teresting moments in the Atlan-

Mondale may have been guil-
ty of a fraud-ian slip when he
was defending himself in an ex-

During the debate, we found
out that Hart pronounces
“‘divisive’’ even worse than
Jimmy Carter pronounced
“‘nuclear.’’

Also, in an exchange with
Mondale concerning Hart’s vote
on a windfall profit tax for oil
companies, Hart cried, ‘‘There
you go again.” Apparently not
content to steal lines from John
Kennedy, he also borrows them
from Reagan.

One of McGovern’s last com-
ments of the campaign was:
“I’m sure that some of the
viewers think that the five of us
Democrats sitting here are
making partisan judgments
about the president.’ What were
that guy’s SAT scores, anyway?

The networks’ post-primary

changes.

Roger Mudd of NBC, in a live
interview with Hart, opined that
“Florida is not a true Southern

do you want?
The best line of the evening
was from ABC’s David

Brinkley, who said to Hart, ‘‘If
you were running for president
of New England, you’d be in
good shape.”

In spite of his otherwise clear-
ly superior performance, the
silliest. phraseology of the night
was from Dan Rather of CBS.
He started a question for the
senator from Colorado by say-
ing, ‘In your heart of hearts...’

In their speeches to their sup-
porters Friday night, none of
the candidates claimed that
their victory was a personal one

Glenn: ‘“‘this idea .. . this

modest.

Refining the decision-making process

WGL’s Society and the Professions Program: Teaching students to think

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

Should a lawyer who knows
his client has committed a
murder for which another man
was convicted break the con-
fidential bond between lawyer
and client to save the innocent
man, or should he remain
silent?

Such barbed questions are
discussed and analyzed as part
of Washington and Lee’s
“Society and the Professions:
Studies in Applied Ethics’’ pro-
gram, according to Dr. Louis
W. Hodges, director of the pro-
gram.

Ethics programs in jour-
nalism, law and medicine were
begun at W&L in 1974, Hodges
said, and a program in business
was added last year.

The programs consist of three
main parts: a_ three-credit
course in the profession’s ethics
taught by Hodges and by a pro-
fessor from the appropriate
department, lectures featuring
prominent professionals, and a
three-day seminar that brings
together 15 ‘professionals and
the ethics students.

This year’s journalism ethics
institute will be held Friday,
Saturday and Sunday. In con-
nection with the institute there
will be a lecture by Gene
Foreman, managing editor of
the Philadelphia Inquirer, Fri-
day at 8 p.m. in Northen
Auditorium.

‘In applied ethics you focus
on the difference between
ethical concepts and profes-
sional decisions. We apply
ethical norms to professional
situations,” Hodges explained. .

Hodges cited the question of
confidential relationships be-
tween professionals and the
public as an issue that crops up
in every profession. Questions
dealing with a client’s right to
privacy and the problem of
dealing with incompetent pro-

<p oy go ota ye 4

Louis Hodges advises senior ethics student Eric Ca

fessionals also are common to
several occupations, he said.

“‘!’m convinced that there’s a
moral element in every decision
a human being makes,”’ argued
Hodges.

Moral questions deal with
what we owe to other people,
Hodges said. He explained that
the word ‘‘ought” is an archaic
form of the verb ‘‘to owe.”’
Thus, when someone says one
ought to do something, he is
really saying that you owe it to
others, Hodges said.

Nevertheless, the purpose of
the ethics program is not to con-
vince students that a certain
position is ethical or unethical,
Hodges pointed out. The pur-
pose of the program is to refine
the decision-making process
that the students use to decide
what is ethical, said Hodges.

“Students at the end of the
course are better able to
employ reason. They are better
able to understand the great
degree of complexity,’’ Hodges
asserted.

Americans are not very skill-
ed at using reason to cope with
moral issues, so people rely on
whims and vague opinions, he
said. By learning to use reason,
the student reduces the confu-
sion surrounding a moral issue,
Hodges explained.

‘I doubt that students change
their value system much. Some-
one who enters the course op-
posed to abortion leaves class
opposed to abortion but with
better reasons for it,’ said
Hodges.

Hodges emphasized that the
ethics program at W&L is a
liberal arts approach to the
issue. Thus, Hodges said, the
program is both beneficial in a
practical and an educational
manner. The pre-professional
becomes aware of his respon-
sibilities to other people and
also improves his way of think-
ing, said Hodges.

“At W&L you have the

development of the mind as an
end to itself, and also the
development of the mind for
professional purposes.”

Hodges said that W&L was
the first college to offer a pro-
gram in applied ethics at the
undergraduate level. Even to-
day not many universities have
undergraduate programs in ap-
plied ethics, he noted.

Nonetheless, Hodges believes
that there are advantages to of-
fering an applied ethics pro-
gram at the undergraduate
level rather than in graduate
school.

‘The student is more distanc-
ed from the occupation. At the
undergraduate level we do get
people at a time when they are
less professionally oriented,”
said Hodges.

The ethics classes have been
popular with the students at
W&L. Hodges said the business,
medical, legal and journalism
ethics classes are usually filled
close to their 15-student capaci-

e%

ty. Bright students in particular
have been attracted to the
classes, he said.

Hodges emphasized that the
ethics classes have always been
enjoyable to teach.

“We have a terrific set of
issues and problems. There’s a
lot of excitement in the class-
room that you don’t often get.
You get the pleasure of seeing
lights going on in people’s
heads,”’ he said.

Although he enjoys teaching
ethics, Hodges said that the con-
stant changes in the field re-
quire him to do a lot of reading
in order to keep up with the sub-
ject. Hodges also keeps in touch
with ethical issues through con-
tact with professionals off cam-
pus. Hodges said he visits news-
rooms, holds seminars at some
newspapers and television sta-
tions and works with the
Hastings Center, an _ ethics
‘think tank’ in New York City.

Hodges said that he has noted
a tremendous surge in interest
in ethics in recent years. He
recently has helped West Vir-
ginia develop ethics programs
for its colleges. Almost 90 per-
cent of medical schools now of-
fer courses in medical ethics,
while ethics courses were of-
fered in about half of the
medical schools in the country
ten years ago, Hodges reported.

“As a civilization we are
more aware now of the power
that professionals have. Con-
sumers are more knowledge-
able and are putting more
pressure on professionals,’’ he
said.

Professionals are responding
to this pressure by taking
greater interest in the ethical
questions related to their field,
he explained. The fear of mal-
practice and libel suits has
spurred professionals to take a
closer look at their practices,
said Hodges.

The increasing maturity of

  
   

professional groups also has
contributed to the increase in
concern for ethics, Hodges
asserted.

‘“‘The professions are coming
of age. The mature group is
always concerned more with
matters of ethics than the im-
mature group,” he said.

Rapid technological advances
also have presented profes-
sionals with new moral ques-
tions. The ability to successfully
perform a kidney transplant,
for instance, raises the question
of who should get the available
kidneys, Hodges noted.

‘‘The more things we can do,
the more you have to ask
yourself what ought we to do.
There are never any new
ethical problems, but old
ethical problems that take new
forms,”’ he said.

Because of the rapid social
and technological changes tak-
ing place in the country, ethics
will be an important topic for
the next 20-25 years. However,
if the pace of change slows
down in the coming years, in-
terest in ethics will diminish
also, said Hodges.

“I predict that interest will
once again wane. The history of
interest in ethics is sort of like a
roller coaster,’’ said Hodges.

Nevertheless, before interest
in ethics diminishes again,
Hodges said that progress will
be made in many ethical issues.

In addition to the journalism
ethics institute at W&L this
weekend, a business ethics in-
stitute will be held March 23-25

at W&L and a medical ethics in-
stitute will be held during

spring term. The legal ethics in-
stitute was held in the fall.

Transcripts of lectures given
in connection with the institutes
are mailed out to all alumni in
that particular professional
field. Many alumni also par-
ticipate in the institutes, said
Hodges.

White Animals unleashed

By EDWIN BELL
Staff Reporter

The White Animals are pro-
bably one of the most popular
groups to play the East Coast
college circuit. Several reasons
account for their mass follow-
ing.

First, a White Animals con-
cert is like no other — it is an ex-
perience. Unlike most bands
who play three professional sets
and say goodbye, the White
Animals are willing to play as
long as the people in the crowd
can still raise their beer
glasses. They enjoy performing
their music and encourage the
audience to feel the ‘‘dread sen-
sation.”

Second, the individual
members’ charisma and stage
presence create an unusual at-
mosphere of give-and-take with
audience.

Third, the White Animals are
all talented musicians who per-
form their own versions of
psychedelic 60s, punk, dub, reg-
gae and soul.

All factors combine to create
the ‘‘dreadbeat sensation” — a
feeling of fear mixed with awe
and reverence, the natural
result of vibrations and exter-
nal stimuli.

The White Animals originate
from Nashville, the hometown
of all of the band’s members ex-
cept Kevin Gray. Gray, a native
of Dallas, is rhythm guitarist
and lead vocalist. He is the one
who can best explain the name
of the group.

“The name describes us
—white kids playing the blues.”’

The rest of the quintet is
bassist and part-time vocalist
Steve Boyd; lead guitarist Rich
Parks; drummer Ray Crab-
tree; and soundman (‘‘dread-
master’’) Tim Coats.

The group has relased an EP
(extended play), ‘‘Nashville
Babylon,’’ an LP, ‘‘Lost

Weekend,” and a video for their

new single, ‘Don’t Care.” The
video has been placed on MTV’s
Light Rotation (2 plays a day.).
Their new album, “Ecstasy,”
was spotlighted as ‘“‘New and
Noteworthy” in Billboard
Magazine (Feb. 18).

The ‘‘dreadbeat sensation’’ is
reflected in ‘‘Ecstasy,” which
also shows off the musical
maturity the group has gained
in the past few years.

Coats’ soundboard creates
the dread, and Ray Crabtree’s
drums turn up the beat. Coats
and Gray also give the music a
better producation and a
clearer sound than previous ef-
~~.

 

The White Animals (left to right): Steve Boyd, base; Ray Crabtree, drums; Kevin Gray, guitar, lead

critics. It might just be the hit
they need.

Parks and Boyd combine
writing efforts on the next act,
“Goodnight and Goodbye.”
Boyd laments on the problem of
an old girlfriend who hangs on
for too long. Backed by Beatles’
harmonies and echo vocals
(trademarks of the White
Animals), Boyd’s timid voice
gives the tune a raspy edge.

Boyd again shows a great feel
for his music in ‘‘This Girl of
Mine.” The track is unique
because it is not cluttered with
overdubs. The song and its sim-
ple arrangement is surely a
tribute to the Beatles.

 

‘“Eestasy” is a total concept product —

it relates the sound, image and _ at-

mosphere of a live performance.’

 

“Ecstasy” is a total concept
product — it relates the sound,
image, and atmosphere of a live
performance.

“Gloria,” the only cover song
is a revealing glimpse of ‘the
total White Animals concept.
Gray transforms the simple
lyrics of Van Morrison into a
story full of clever innuendos.
Clocking in at a length of 9:14,
the song is a series of erotic
choruses and psychedelic in-
strumentals that build on one
another until the final climax of
the traditional ‘‘G-L-O-R-I-A.”’

An original single, “Don’t
Care,” is a marriage of the
“dance my life away” attitude
of Prince mixed with the punk-
anthem call of the Clash. The
song has already received con-
siderable regional airplay and
caught the attention of several

“For Lovers Only” is Gray’s
nod to the group’s rhythm and
blues roots. The slow, hypnotic
beat conjures up the smokey
blue haze of a slow dance at the
end of -a long night. Gray’s
hoarse vocals and Park’s
ringing solos evoke the
primitive emotions that arise
from these close situations. The
song leaves one with the ex-
hilarating fatigue that comes at
the end of a White Animals con-
cert.

“Ecstasy” is a step in the
right direction. The record ac-
curately captures the unique
White. Animals’ sound and re-
flects the maturity the group
has gained over the years. The
only better way to capture this
image, sound and atmosphere
would be for the White Animals
to release a live album, which I
hope is not too far in the future.

Senior directs
‘Hot Tin Roof’

By BOB BRYANT
Staff Reporter

“Tennesse Williams said that
every human being is a selfish
animal and the world is a cage.
I’m basing my production on
this quote,”’ said Drew Perkins,
director of “Cat on a Hot Tin
Roof,’’ which opens March 23 at
the Troubador Theatre. The
play is the winter production of
the University Theatre and will
run through March 28. Curtain
time is 8 p.m. for all perfor-
mances.

Perkins, who is directing the
play for his senior thesis, said
he chose “Cat on a Hot Tin
Roof’”’ because “I have a
natural flavor for Tennesse
Williams. I didn’t want to go
through four years of college
without doing any Williams. He
is as much a classic as
Shakespeare. Too many people
take Williams too seriously. I
think people should enjoy his
comedy and learn from his
serious drama.”

“The simple plot is about the
passing of an estate from one
generation to the next. What
makes it complicated is that
this family is divided between

two sons.’’ Brick, played by
W&L senior Bob Ferguson, is
the more empathetic of the two
sons in spite of his alcoholism.
His brother, Gooper, played by
first year law student Chuck
Richards, is a successful cor-
porate lawyer who “‘is a lot like
Macbeth because he is driven
by his ambitious wife.”’

Bill Rough, director of
theatre at Southern Seminary
Junior College, plays Big Dad-
dy, the patriarch of the family.
It is the news that Big Daddy is
dying of cancer that sends the
family into confusion over an
heir. “Big Daddy doesn’t know
he’s dying until the family tells
him,” Perkins said.

“My whole concept for the
play is a cage.” he said. ‘‘This
family can’t resolve this pro-
blem. They are trapped in this
cage.”

Also featured in the cast are
first year law student Nan
Korns as Maggie, Ginger
NeNeese as Big Mama,
Southern Seminary student Liz
Spence as Mae, senior Ted
Petrides as Dr. Baugh,
sophomore David Marsh as the
Rev. Tooker, and junior Terry
McWhorter as Lacey.

Film Society to show
Russian ‘Siberiade ’

The Washington and Lee Uni-
versity Film Society will pre-
sent a 1979 Russian film titled
“Siberiade” at 8 p.m. Friday
and Saturday, March 16 and 17.

The film will be screened in
Classroom A of Lewis Hall. The
film will be shown in Russian
with English subtitles. There is
no charge for admission and the
public is invited to attend.

Directed by Andrei Kon-
chalovsky, ‘‘Siberiade”’ is a
lavishly photographed epic set
in a remote hamlet in Siberia.

Spanning three generations and
six decades, the film traces the
fortunes of two families — one
rich, the other poor — as their
village is touched by the enor-
mous changes of the 20th cen-
tury, in particular the Russian
Revolution.

In its original four-and-a-half
hour form (the W&L version
will be 183 minutes long),
“Siberiade” was an enormously
popular success in its native
country, with more than 70
million viewers.

Glee Club to perform
special Lenten Concert

The Washington and Lee
University Glee Club and the
Hollins College Chapel Choir
will present a special Lenten
Concert on Tuesday, March 20,
at 8 p.m. in Lee Chapel.

The public is invived to at-
tend. Admission is free.

The concert program will
feature a performance of
Mozart’s ‘“‘Solemn Vespers’ by
the combined choirs with
soprano soloist Rita Cummins.
Written in 1780, the text for
Mozart’s ‘‘Solemn Vespers”’ is
taken from the Psalms and the

Gospel of Luke.
In addition to ‘Solemn
Vespers,’’ the two musical

groups will perform sacred
motets.

Washington and Lee’s 57-
member Glee Club is directed
by Gordon Spice, associate pro-
fessor of music at W&L.

The Hollins College Chapel
Choir is conducted by James
Leland, who will be the organist
for the concert.

The Lenten Concert will also
be performed in the Hollins Col-
lege Chapel on Sunday, March
17, at7 p.m.

High praise and vegetables too
Aloha Wok offers wide range of good meals

By EDDIE CURRAN
Staff Reporter

A famed rock journalist once
said that the only honest way to
review a record is to review it
strictly according to time spent
on the turntable. Granted this
method cannot be applied to
every category subject to
review. One couldn’t get away
with, “I only read it once, so...,”’
or ‘‘I only had one date with her,
so...’’ but it is nonetheless fairly
applicable with respect to food,
as long as you make sure to
keep in mind certain variables,
such as ease of acquisition (ie.
“Let the Domino’s man get cold
and miss the second half.’’)

Dd
The
Eat Beat

Applying this criteria, I have
no choice but to give the Aloha
Wok high praise. My father,
who serves as a middleman be-
tween the bank and myself as
he sends me my used checks,
once asked almost heatedly,
‘“‘What’s this Aloha Wok?’”’ Well,
the Aloha Wok, or ‘‘the Wok,”’ is
the only Chinese restaurant in
Lexington, and we should be
thankful for it. There are pro-
bably few Lexington-size towns
out there with a Chinese
restaurant, much less one as
good as the Wok.

For freshmen and unadven-
turous upperclassmen, the
Aloha Wok is located at 409
South Main St., about 3 blocks
past where Main St. becomes
two-way, and attached to the
left side of the Royal Host Hotel.
It’s open for lunch and dinner
six days a week, closed on Mon-
days and closed for lunch on
Saturdays.

The Wok is_ not one-
dimensional. It can be a nice
place to take a date for
candlelight dinner with drinks
and low, mysterious Chinese
music, or a place to get a
reasonably priced lunch on a
weekday, to get take-out, and
eat at home, or, and this is my
favorite way to enjoy the Wok,
to eat all the Chinese food you
can eat at their Sunday buffet.

Forking out the $4.95 for the
Sunday buffet at the Aloha Wok
can be justified on several
levels — it’s delicious, you pro-
bably won’t need to eat again
until the next day and you are a
growing boy who needs his
vegetables. It is with respect to
vegetables that the Chinese
Style of cooking stands above all
others. It seems like only
yesterday that cooked cabbage
and carrots were dirty words,
something you had to hold your
nose and eat so you could have a
piece of cake. Maybe if mothers
owned woks they wouldn’t have
to bake so many cakes, because:
Chinese style vegetables are an
end unto themselves. Broccoli,
snow peas, celery, water

chestnuts and much more can
be mixed in a seemingly endless
number of combinations. And
the best part about Chinese
vegetables is their unforgetta-
ble crispness; freshness is nev-
er doubted for one bite. If your
fraternity house doesn’t serve
what you consider to be
vegetables worth eating, or if
you eat too many hamburgers
and pizzas, it’s likely that you
might eat more vegetables at
the Wok’s Sunday buffet than
you would eat for the entire rest
of the week. When you consider
that vegetables are good for
you, even necessary, this is
something to think about.

But, you ask, quoting the wit-
ty candidate Walter Mondale,
‘“‘Where’s the beef?”’ If you look
under the vegetables, I think
you'll find it. At the buffet,
you'll always have at least one
chicken, pork and beef dish (no
seafood dishes at the buffet), at
least one of which will be a
spicy dish. There is plenty of
meat, especially in the chicken
dishes. Every Sunday there is a
different combination of six
Chinese dishes — for instance,
you might have Chicken Al-
mond, Beef with Green Pepper,
Roast Pork with Snow Peas,
Beef Chow Mein, Chicken Fried

 

Rice, and the Vegetables
Sauteed.

‘you ask, ...
““Where’s’ the

beef?” If you look

under the  vege-
tables, I think
you'll find it.’

 

There will also be a sweet and
sour dish, a personal favorite,
with chicken, pork or wonton.
This has a sweet and sour
pineapple sauce poured over
(or if you like, not poured over)
fried chunks of chicken, pork,
or fried wonton.

There is also, and this is im-
portant, all the egg rolls you can
eat. The egg rolls are delicious,
with a flaky, crunchy, golden
outside covering whatever it is
that’s so good inside an egg roll.
An anomymous friend and
fellow chow-hound begs me to
stick a couple of these in my
coat pocket to bring him, and is

very disappointed if I forget.
Don’t forget to dip the egg rolls
in the available sweet sauce or
Chinese mustard though watch
out for the mustard. Too much
will clear the pipes like am-
monia never could.

Also, there is tossed salad and
a dessert, usually not that good,
but this matters little, for you
can eat lettuce anywhere, and
there are plenty of better ways
here to fill limited stomach
Space than with dessert
anyway. Get some more sweet
and sour chicken if you need to
satisfy a sweet tooth.

If you go to the Wok at night,
check the menu carefully, as it
has a description of each meal.
For instance, I’ve never had
Hai Shien Sizzhing, but
“Choicest gulf shrimp, delicate
crab meat, succulent scallop
sauteed with exotic mushrooms
and folded in vegetable sauce”’
sounds pretty good to me.

I can speak first hand of the
Four Seasons, a dish of chicken,
shrimp, beef, roast pork, and
Chinese vegetables. The
vegetables in the Four Seasons
are especially good; among
them are what appear to be
bite-size stalks of corn, called
baby corn ears. They alone
make the dish memorable.

The Wok has several exotic
drinks and appetizers to choose
from while you’re waiting for
your meal. I went on a school
night, so I couldn’t drink, but
drinks with names like Blue
Hawaii and Fog Cutter were
tempting. If you want an ap-
petizer, they have what’s called
a Flaming Puu Puu Tray, with
barbecue rib, shrimp tempura,
fried wonton, cho-cho (which is
strips of beef that you dip in a
sauce and stick over a flame).
This tray is more fun than it is
tasty, as the ribs and chicken
wings are not house specialties,
the shrimp tempura is heavily
breaded, and the cho-cho,
though exciting to heat and eat,
doesn’t have much taste. For
the non-pyromaniac though, I
recommend an order of fried
wontons, which are crunchy on
the outside, with a chewy piece
of meat on the inside, and are
good with sweet sauce and
mustard, and/or some egg
rolls. The wonton soup is also
very good. And of note, every-
thing you can get on the Wok
menu you can also get for Wok
take-out. Plenty of the dishes
are cheaper than a delivered
pizza, and will make you hap-
pier afterwards.

And the Wok offers luncheon
specials at around $3; the serv-
ings are slightly smaller, but
you get an egg roll with the
meal. Keep these in mind if
your fraternity serves hot dogs
for the second day in a row, or if
they’re serving those open-
faced Reubens in the dining
hall.

Next week, the Eat Beat
locates the well hidden Old
Main Sandwich Shop.

Lax falls into first-quarter hole

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

Despite outscoring Navy 8-5
in the game’s last three
quarters, the Washington and
Lee lacrosse Generals could not
dig themselves out of an 8-1 first
quarter hole, falling to the Mid-
shipmen 13-9, Saturday after-
noon at Wilson Field.

The loss evens the Generals’
season mark at 1-1, while Satur-
day’s win was Navy’s first
match of its 1984 campaign.

“It was a disappointment for
us to lose a game that I think we
proved we were capable of win-
ning,’ W&L head coach Dennis
Daly said.

Navy helmsman Bryan Mat-
thews was content with his
team’s consistency. “I was
pleased at what we showed we
were capable of doing when we
played real well, and I was
pleased that when things got go-
ing tough we didn’t fold up and
go home,” he said.

Navy’s explosive start put
W&L on the short end from the
outset. Midshipman Robert
Garland bounced a shot past
goalie Phil Aiken with 2:51 gone
in the first period to set off a
seven-goal barrage that put
Navy in front to stay.

“When a team gets things
clicking, it’s tough to stop,”
Matthews pointed out.

But the Generals’ mentor saw
the quarter differently.

“There were too many little
breakdowns early on, both on
the offensive end and the defen-
sive end,” Daly said, ‘‘that
caused Navy to get a spurt on
us.”

The Generals’ Barry Water-
man scored with 3:30 to go in
the quarter, ending the Navy at-
tack. The two teams played
evenly throughout the rest of
the match.

The Generals rallied to
outscore Navy 4-3 in the second
quarter, and the teams went to
the locker room at halftime
with the Middies out in front,
11-5. Junior attack Jeff Mason
triggered the W&L comeback,

scoring three goals in the last
five minutes of the half.

The second half proved a
defensive struggle with much of
the play at midfield. Daly said
he was pleased with his team’s
effort in this area. He cited the
fine play of middies Kevin
Walakovits, Barry Waterman
and T.J. Finnerty.

The Generals gave up the
first two goals of the third

Navy victory. Nims turned
away 14 General shots and was
successful on 26 of 37 attempts
toclear.

that we never think he’s about
to fold. It was not an unusual
performance for him at all,”’

“Their reputation is as a run-
ning team, but there are some
reports that they might be a lit-
tle less of a running team,’’ Da-
ly said. He emphasized the tran-
sition game and control of the
other team’s fast break as key
points of concentration for
W&L.

The Generals end their road
trip Wednesday with a match
against Delaware.

 

 

‘It was a disappointment for us to lose a

game that I think we proved we were

capable of winning.’

 

While both teams got scoring
opportunities, Daly said,
Navy’s more often resulted in
scores. ‘‘We were hitting
singles, and they were hitting
home runs,’’ he said.

With six minutes to play in the
quarter and the score 4-0, junior
John DiDuro came in to replace
Aiken, who had saved only one
of the five shots he faced.
DiDuro went on to finish the
game, turning away 13 shots
and allowing nine goals.

shipmen for the rest of the

captain Tim Schurr and
sophomore Chris John.

Mason added two more goals
to give him five on the day, and
Lee Heimert and Rod San-
tomassimo each registered
goals to close out the scoring.

Taking the title
is no easy task

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

....Well, everybody is calmed
down now and ready to dig
themselves in for the over-
before-you-know-it NCAA
championship tournament.
With the conference shenani-
gans and the troublesome selec-
tion process all through, we
come to the determination of a
definitive national champion.
And let’s get that matter
cleared up right away. First,
you can’t arrive at a No. 1 team
in the country by any method.
Everyone will have his gripe
about a tournament, the main
one being that the tournament
winner is merely a team lucky
enough to survive the pressure-
packed grind. Too much, they
say, can depend on the luck of
the draw. Or, the winner of the
tournament is the hottest team
at the right time, not the group
with the best overall perfor-
mance for the year. Well, begg-
ing these complainers’ pardons,

son are as good as anyone ever
was and are getting better. But
it’s tournament time, so let’s
not engrave the trophy yet. In
the East Regional, Carolina is
fading and Eddie Sutton’s Hogs
are peaking. Other squads to
watch: Syracuse — they really
beat G-town in the Big East
final — and Auburn. In the

i ee eee ee)
Time Out...

Mideast, watch Maryland (very
hot) and Kentucky (very
good). Sleepers: UAB (Bar-
tow’s bunch is at home and was
born to upset people) and
Oregon St. The question in the
Midwest Regional is who has
enough guts to knock off
DePaul. Any team in this group-
ing does, but Memphis St. and
Wake Forest are my favorites
here. Finally, in the West,
UTEP or UNLV will get the
first shot at the Hoyas. Both
groups are capable. The winner
of Saturday’s second-round

IM Corner

 

 

‘Well, begging these complainers’ par-

dons, but they’re wrong.’

 

but they’re wrong. First, no one
wins on luck alone, especially
not for four, five or six games in
a row. Second, teams that don’t
belong there don’t go. This is
not to say that teams that don’t
go, don’t belong there. UT-
Chattanooga (23-6) and Lamar
(25-4) are two fine squads that
weren’t invited, but never-
theless there are very few easy
rides tec Seattle this year as in
any yer. Anybody can beat
anybody on any given day and
it’s no truer than at tournament
time. Just ask Dean Smith
about the upset. There is
nothing comparable to the com-
petitive pressure an NCAA
favorite faces at tournament
time. In addition, the pressure
is equally great for those teams
labeled Cinderellas after this
weekend. The point being that
to win the national tournament
takes a good enough team to be
invited in the first place (no
small order), an ability to main-
tain the mental and physical
capabilities of a winner, and
enough luck to guide you to the
title. And for my money any
team that can muster those
characteristics deserves to be
known as national champion...
...Given that summation,
here are the teams that should
make headlines during the
month. Right at the top, the
Hoyas are the team to beat.
Georgetown and John Thomp-

clash between. the two will win
the region, unless Tisdale at
Oklahoma gets juiced. There-
fore, my _ conservative
estimates for visitors in Seat-
tle: Syracuse, Kentucky, Mem-
phis St. and UNLV....

...90me quick colonnade
thoughts. Saturday’s lax game.
The first quarter was a dis-
grace. That can only be said
because of how well the last
three were played. A bit of con-
cern here that we’re seeing the
same problem as last year’s
group had in putting four sound
quarters together. Hope not...
Good luck to swimmers as they
go to Emory, Va. for the Divi-
sion III Nationals. Surprise
team indeed...

...5ome tennis notes: John
McEnroe is looking too good for
the rest of the circuit right now.
Mac’s won 24 in a row this year,
including five tournaments.
Sounds like another lefty is pull-
ing the old dominance routine
(see Martina)... Keep this
under your hat, but word is
Bjorn Borg is interested in play-
ing some tournaments in
France this summer. Most ex-
perts say he’s still easily in the
top five. I’ll believe it when I see
ae

has signed again with the

education would hurt him...

Netters fall to Div. I Lehigh,
trounce Emory & Henry, 8-1

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee ten-
nis team opened its 1984 ODAC
schedule with an 8-1 victory
against Emory and Henry yes-
terday at the W&L tennis
courts. The Generals, who up-
ped their season mark to 2-2,
however dropped a match to
NCAA Division I Lehigh by a
score of 6-3 at home on Monday.

W&L won five of the six
singles matches and swept the
three doubles matches in
yesterday’s impressive victory
over the Wasps. The match was
the Generals’ conference
opener.

Head tennis coach Gary
Franke was very pleased with
the Generals’ overwhelming
performance yesterday. Ac-
cording to Franke, Emory &
Henry had just finished their
southern tour before playing
W&L and their team was play-
ing well.

Concerning the Lehigh
match, Coach Franke said, ‘“‘I

 

thought it was a really even
match, a match we could have
very much won.”’ Franke be-
lieves that the key to the match
for Lehigh was their winning
two very close singles matches
at the No. 2and No. 4 positions.

Senior captain Craig Cannon
(No. 1) and sophomore Scott
Adams (No. 3) earned singles
victories for the Generals in the
losing cause. Cannon defeated
his opponent in straight sets,
6-3, 6-4. Adams fought back to
win his match, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, after
losing the first set.

Adams also teamed with sen
ior Jim Irwin at No. 3 doubles to
collect the Generals’ third and
final win of the match.

Friday, the Generals travel to
Williamsburg to play William
and Mary. The Generals return
home to play George Washing-
ton on Sunday at 10 a.m.

Other upcoming matches in-
clude an away contest against
Randolph-Macon on Monday
and a home match versus
Averett on Tuesday.

‘Nine’ sweeps W. Va. Tech,

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
baseball team won two of four
home games last week to even
its record at 3-3.

Last Thursday, the Generals
fell to VMI 8-4 while playing in
bad weather. Freshman out-
fielder Adam Yanez provided
all of W&L’s offense, hitting a
grand slam home run in his first
collegiate at bat.

Sunday, W&L swept a double-
header from West Virginia
Tech by scores of 8-7 and 7-2.

In the first game the Generals
jumped out to a 5-0 lead in the
first inning. Singles by catcher
Mike Jacoby and _ shortstop-
captain Dave Warrenfeltz and a
double by rightfielder Chip Hut-
chins sparked the Generals ex-
plosive start.

West Virginia Tech battled
back from its deficit to take a
7-5 lead into the bottom of the
seventh inning. Led by Jacoby’s
game-winning single and five
walks issued by Golden Bears
pitchers, W&L tallied three

runs in the seventh to win the
game 8-7,

In the second game, W&L
jumped to an early lead and
was never threatened, winning
7-2. W&L pitcher Kirk Breen
turned in an excellent perfor-
mance and was supported by
third baseman Billy White’s
three hits. Second baseman
Kevin Golden also had three
hits, Warrenfeltz had two and
first baseman-captain Mike
Walsh hit a home run.

W&L head coach Jim Mur-
dock said that his team ‘‘did
what it took to win’’ against
West Virginia Tech.

' “In the first game, we did not
quit — a trademark of this’
team,” said Murdock. ‘‘In the
seventh, we simply became
more selective and put pressure
on them to put the ball over.
Jacoby then came up with the
clutch winning RBI single.”’

“In the second game, we
finally got our bats going. We
were not too anxious and seem-
ed to be relaxed at the plate,”’

ups mark to 3-3

 

Murdock said. ‘Breen also
pitched one heck of a game.”’

W&L lost to visiting Virginia
Wesleyan 8-3 Monday. The Gen-
erals fell behind 6-0 in the first
three innings and were unable
to score until the sixth inning,

‘Surprise ’

For six W&L_student-
swimmers, the promise of All-
America status and a finish
among the top teams in the na-
tion is within reach. On March
15-17 they will represent W&L in
the NCAA Division III National
Championships at Emory Uni-
versity in Atlanta.

The Generals have been
labeled a possible ‘surprise’
team by NCAA meet director
Scott Murphy. ‘Washington
and Lee University...offers
variety to the swimming
dominance of Midwestern and
California schools,’ he said.
“T’'d say that if anyone could
surprise it might be Washington
and Lee.”

The six Generals who will be
competing are seniors Tim
Rock and Gary Meyer, juniors
Bobby Pearson and Taber
Smith, sophomore Tim Stanford
and freshman Jay ReVille.

Rock, a biology major, will
compete in the 1,650-freestyle,
an event that he became an All-
American in three years ago.
He did not qualify for the
NCAAs last year, but set his

Freshman Bill Schoettelkotte
started the game for the
Generals and was relieved by
another freshman, Randy

Schoettelkotte gave up two

sights on making it again as a

easier for an underclassman to
excel at W&L because there are
less academic demands on
him,” explained W&L aquatics
coach Page Remillard. ‘‘Tim
proved he was an All-American
as a freshman, and his qualify-
ing again as a senior is an in-
dication of his character. He set
a personal goal to make swim-
ming part of his curriculum and
has passed with flying colors.”

Meyer, an economics major,
was the Generals’ lone All-
American last year, when he
finished the 100-yard free in 11th
place in the NCAAs. He will
compete in the 50- and 100-yard
freestyle and the 400-yard free
relay this year. He has already
posted top-ten times in the na-
tion in both individual races this
year.

‘Gary has the ability and the
confidence to become an All-
American for the third year (he
was a member of W&L’s All-
America 400-free relay team in
1982),”’ said Remillard. ‘His
confidence is based on the fact

Pearson, an economics ma-
jor, and Smith, a business ma-
jor, will compete as members of
the 400-free relay teaiz ‘‘They
both have worked hard ali their
careers and have earned the
right to swim in the nationals,”
said Remillard.

Stanford, a business major,
will swim in the 100- and 200-
yard butterfly races and will
also be a member of the free
relay team. “Tim is mentally
and physically prepared and if
he can control his race pace he
could be in the top 12,” said
Remillard.

ReVille, a chemistry major,
has been phenomenal as a
freshman and will represent
W&L in the 200-and 400-yard in-
dividual medleys and the 200-
backstroke. ‘‘He is as talented
as any swimmer in Division
III,” stated Remillard. ‘He
should be in the top 12 in his
events and could finish as high
as the top six. His ability to
motivate himself and experi-
ence will be the keys, but I don’t
see either as a problem.”’

Last year W&L finished 40th
in the NCAAs, and a top-15
finish this year will be the
largest one-year jump ever for
a W&L team. If any of W&L’s
swimmers earn All-America
status, it will be the ninth con-
secutive year that the Generals
have had a swimmer earn that
distinction.

Thanksgiving threatened

(continued from page 1)

Feldman said ‘‘faculty
politics’’ would prevent ap-
proval of a two- or three-day
Thanksgiving vacation because
of the confusion that would
create with science laboratory
classes that meet only once a
week.

“So it’s either a week (for
Thanksgiving) or nothing,”
Feldman said.

A law student at Monday’s EC
meeting, though, recommended
a calendar followed by his
undergraduate school, Hamil-
ton College. There were no
classes on a Monday and a
Tuesday in the middle of Oc-
tober, normally around Colum-
bus Day. Thanksgiving vaca-
tion consisted of no classes on
Wednesday, Thursday or Fri-
day of Thanksgiving week.

school, where Baumgaertner
won 242 of the 257 votes cast.

Green said he was setting up
the polls about 9 a.m. Thursday
when he noticed the posters and
took them down because he felt
they would exceed White’s limit
of 15 posters and because, he
said, they were ‘‘misleading.”’
The posters were misleading,
Green said, because although
they were signed by White, they
had not been put up by him.

Most EC members, though,
agreed that Green should have
conferred with White before
removing the posters. Presi-
dent Bob Jenevein said it was
Green’s position to determine
regulations, not etiquette.

“It was Green’s obligation to
approach White, not to take
down posters for him,’’ said
sophomore representative Ken
Lindeman. ‘‘It was not his place
as VRB chairman to take them

Feldman said he personally
was in favor of that idea and
would recommend it to the
faculty tomorrow.

Feldman said he couldn’t see
any problems with the proposal
because each day’s classes
would be missed once. Thus,
although one section of a lab
might be ahead of the other be-
tween the October break and
Thanksgiving, it would all
balance out at the end of the
semester.

The committee voted to
recommend that students be re-
quired to register for their en-
tire year’s course-load the prior
spring because ‘‘the faculty is
very upset that they have to
spend 12 days in their offices
each year to register students,”’
Feldman said.

Junior representative Darby
Brower said, ‘“‘It is an illegal act
for anyone to take down some-
one else’s posters.”

Freshman representative An-
drew Caruthers said the VRB
chairman ‘‘does not have the
right to take down any poster.”

Vice president Dave Judge
said, ‘‘I think he kind of broke
that barrier of impartiality the
moment he took them down.”

Although junior represen-
tative and president-elect Cole
Dawson said he agreed it was
not right for Green to have
taken down the posters, he add-
ed, “I think it was an honest
mistake.”

After Green said he felt it was
his obligation as VRB co-
chairman to take them down,
Sicilian called for a new elec-
tion to be held.

“Tf this isn’t the case for a re-
vote, I don’t know when you’re
going to get one,”’ he said.

‘They felt the students were
careless under the drop-add
policy, and this would just make
them more respectful of the
system,’’ he added.

 

‘So it’s either a

week (for Thanks-

giving) or nothing.’

 

Junior representative Darby
Brower pointed out, though,
that the number of drop-adds
would increase because stu-
dents would have difficulty

selecting all their courses a
year ahead of time. Also, a stu-
dent who signed up for an
upper-level course in the winter
or spring but failed a pre-
requisite in the fall would have
to change his schedule in order
to take the pre-requiste again.

Senior representative Jim
Messer noted that, because
students would be registering
for so many courses at once,
there would be longer lines at
the professors’ offices during
the registration period.

Before the EC voted unani-
mously against the idea,
freshman representative An-
drew Caruthers said, ‘I don’t
have any sympathy (with the
professors) because we’re pay-
ing to be here and neck re paid
to be here.”’

The EC also voted unani-
mously against a one-week Oc-
tober vacation and 10-0-1, with
senior law representative Jim
Green abstaining, in favor of
the 12-12-6 calendar.

Feldman said he was ‘‘very
disappointed” with the par-
ticipation in the first calendar —
poll and hoped more students
would vote in Monday’s poll.
The polls will be open from 9
a.m. to 4 p.m., and seniors will
be allowed to vote on the calen-
dar issues.

The calendar committee
should finish its work and make
a report to President John D.
Wilson by mid-April, Feldman
said. Any calendar changes
would have to be approved by
the faculty and would not go in-
to effect until the 1985-86
academic year, he said.

 

Sicilian said after the meeting
that he made that statement
merely to show the EC that he
was serious; he _ reversed
himself later in the meeting,
saying he personally didn’t
think a new election was
necessary.

The EC voted 8-0, with White,
Messer and Green abstaining,
to approve Dawson’s motion to
stand behind the election unless
Baumgaertner, who was not at
Monday’s meeting, appealed
within 24 hours.

The EC also voted 10-0, with
White abstaining, to approve
Caruthers’ motion that any
campaign literature was an in-
dividual action and did not
represent the views of the EC.

Caruthers was appointed to
head a committee to study
possible revisions in the voting

Tules, particularly those con-

cerning the contributions a
third party may make in an
election.

White beat Baumgaertner by
26 votes. White captured 51.4
percent, or 482, of the 938 votes
cast, and Baumgaertner 48.6
percent, or 456.

In the secretary’s race,
Dalton won 64.4 percent, 591
votes, to defeat second-year law
student John Miller, who finish-
ed with 35.6 percent, or 327
votes.

In other action Monday night,
the EC heard budget reports
from:

The Mock Convention, which
has raised 81.17 percent of its
budget.

eThe Student Association for
Black Unity, which requested a
$1,500 to $2,000 contribution for
the May 5 SABU Ball, the pro-
ceeds from which will go
toward establishing a scholar-
ship in the name of former
secretary Marjorie Poindexter.
The EC delayed action until
next week.

The Ariel, which reported
that it still planned two issues
with a circulation of between

800 and 1,000. Rick Swagler,
editor, said the format would be
changed to more of a magazine
style with features as well as
the usual prose and poetry.
Under sharp questioning from
Jenevein and Messer, who
revealed that 280 copies were
unused last year, Swagler said
he felt the revised format would
increase student interest. “I
think we can get enough out to
justify the expense,”’ he said.

eThe Student Bar Associa-
tion, which reported that ex-
penses for a second-year law
students’ party had run $400
over budget due to some
damage done to the dining hall.

eThe Hockey Club, which had
its funds unfrozen by reporting
a $10 balance.

Design for pavilion finalized
Added length to building will allow for tennis court

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

Having narrowed the choice
to two potential designs for the
planned University pavilion,
the administration has decided
on a compromise version that
will provide for a_ longer
building, Frank Parsons, ex-
ecutive assistant to President
Wilson, said Tuesday.

The final design, which is sub-
ject to the approval of the Board
of Trustees, provides for a
structure that is 150 feet long
and 92 feet wide with a height of
24 feet to the eaves, said Par-
sons. One of the proposed plans
had called for a building that
was 150 feet long by 98 feet
wide, and the second plan pro-
posed a building that was 130
feet long by 92 feet wide, Par-
sons reported.

The additional length will per-
mit the installation of an indoor
tennis court, Parsons said.
However, he emphasized that
the primary reason for building
the pavilion was to provide
room for social and recrea-
tional activities, not the tennis
court.

Parsons said that architects
had told the University that the
indoor tennis court could be ad-
ded at relatively little cost by
simply lengthening the pavil-
ion.

“I think that this is an accept-
able compromise. The whole
project has been characterized
by a good degree of cooperation
between the Student Activities
Board and the athletic depart-
ment,’’ said Parsons.

SAB Treasurer John
Haywood said that the SAB was
generally satisfied with the
plans for the pavilion.

‘“‘We’re very pleased with the
progress. We really do have a
problem with inadequate
facilities. This will make it
much easier for us to offer
University-wide activities,’’
Haywood said.

The SAB hopes to hold its first

event in the pavilion during
Homecoming weekend in Oc-
tober, Haywood said. At least
four events each semester will
be held in the pavilion, and the
SAB hopes to boost the total to
10-12 dates per semester by
coordinating several Sunday
events with the fraternities,

. Haywood said.

The cost of the new pavilion
will fall somewhere between
$582,000 and $677,000 for the two
original designs, Parsons said.
Architects are drawing up the
modified design of the pavilion
to meet the new specifications
and will be able to provide an
exact price tag when the blue-
prints are completed, explained
Parsons.

“The object will be to effect
savings and reduce the cost of
the building to the lowest possi-
ble cost. We are not seeking to
build a very fancy building, but
one that will last for a long
time,” emphasized Parsons.

Parsons said that he still an-
ticipates that construction of
the pavilion will begin by June 1
and that the building will be
ready by the end of October.

The University has selected
Bass Construction Co. of Rich-
mond to build the pavilion. Par-
sons said that Bass has done all
the University’s construction
since 1976.

Bass built the University
Library and renovated McCor-
mick Hall, Graham-Lees Dor-
mitory and Evans Dining Hall.
Parsons said that Bass sets
realistic cost estimates and gets
the work done on time.

“‘Bass hasn’t missed getting a
job done on time yet,” Parsons
noted.

Parsons said that the
pavilion’s floor will be a type
suitable for athletic events and
able to withstand spilled beer
and cigarettes. Parsons ex-
plained that the athletic depart-
ment had wanted a floor that
athletes would not be injured on
if they fell, while the SAB
wanted a floor that would be

durable. Parsons said that
several surfaces serve both pur-
poses.

Haywood said that the SAB is
satisfied with the type of floor
selected. Originally the SAB
had objected to one type of floor
because it would not adequately
withstand cigarette burns,
Haywood said.

Parsons said the pavilion will
have steel siding and will look
like an athletic fieldhouse from
the outside.

“I only hope that students
won’t park on the baseball field
or other fenced-off areas,” Par-
sons said.

Haywood said that the SAB
wanted better access to the
area and the use of existing
parking lots nearby. Cars also
could be parked near Liberty
Hall, Haywood said.

The site of the pavilion will be
the pine woods north of Lewis
Hall, about 500 feet from
Buildings and Grounds’ offices.
The facility will have a capacity
of between 1,000 and 1,200 peo-
ple.

Student poll shows support
for current 12-12-6 calendar

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

Students voting in Monday’s
poll favored by overwhelming
margins the 12-12-6 calendar,
50-minute classes, registration
once per term and a one-week
Thanksgiving vacation.

The faculty calendar commit-
tee voted two weeks ago to re-
tain the 12-12-6 calendar, extend
classes to 55 minutes apiece,
establish a one-week vacation
in the middle of October and re-
quire students to register Yor
their entire following year’s
course-load during the spring of
the preceding year.

The committee had been
scheduled to debate the
possiblity of eliminating
Thanksgiving vacation Friday,
but student representative Lee
Feldman said the committee
did not meet, preferring to wait
for the results of Monday’s poll.

Feldman had planned to rec-
ommend to the committee a
fall-term calendar that would
have no classes on a Monday
and Tuesday in the middle of
October or on the Wednesday,
Thursday and Friday of
Thanksgiving week. That pro-
posal will be presented to the
faculty committee tomorrow,
Feldman said.

The only issue on Monday’s
ballot not garnering at least 90
percent support was 50-minute
classes, for which 491 students,
or 78.9 percent, voted. 131
students favored 55-minute
classes.

The 12-12-44 calendar was
favored by 90.3 percent, or 561
of the voters, the Thanksgiving
break by 93.8 percent, or 577,
over a one-week October break,
and one registration per term,
rather than one per year, by
98.9 percent, or 617 voters. Only
seven students favored the one-
registration-per-year plan.

Feldman said he had ex-
pected more students to support

Review and Outlook

Voice of the Poll

When Lee Feldman, student representative to the
Calendar Committee, presented the committee’s pro-
posed changes at an Executive Committee meeting
two weeks ago, the reaction by the students who were
present was that of great surprise at the drastic
transformation of the University calendar which the
committee had envisioned. Junior representative and
president-elect Cole Dawson called one of the propos-
ed items “ridiculous.”’ We agree for the most part.

A poll taken during Monday’s class elections reaf-
firmed the student body’s negative sentiment on the
proposed changes. With only one exception, student
opinion was over 90 percent against the changes and
in favor of the current system.

Matters of the calendar and class length ultimately
go to the faculty for final approval or rejection. Con-
sequently the faculty also bears the burden of respon-
sibility for deciding what they feel is in the students’
best interests.

Students, though, should not dismiss the faculty as
having a lesser interest in the calendar.

The attitude of ‘‘we pay to go here and they’re paid
to be here” is ignorant at best. Some members of the
faculty have devoted their lives to Washington and
Lee whereas many students will only devote four
years. The faculty has as great an interest in the mat-
ter as the students and should not be discounted.

Specifically, however, we oppose the majority of
the changes the committee has proposed. In light of
the overwhelmingly high negative student opinion, we
think it wise for the faculty to consider this sentiment.

White requested to explain

To the Editors:

I wish to call for a public
statement from the Vice-
President elect of the Executive
Committee, James White, to ex-
plain his role in the bombing in-
cident that took place at the
Sigma Nu fraternity on March
3, 1984. The Ring-tum Phi
(3-15-84) verified the accuracy
of a widely circulated rumor
that White was involved in the
incident. However, the Phi did
not clearly explain his role in it.
As a member of the student
body that White seeks to repre-
sent, I wish to gain a full and
clear understanding of his in-
volvement so that I can make
an objective evaluation of his
qualifications as a represen-
tative and leader.

I believe that all members of
the Washington and Lee com-
munity, and most certainly the
members of the Executive
Committee, should strive to ap-
peal to the highest level of the
characteristics of honor, in-
tegrity, responsibility, and
maturity. I question whether

Correction

Due to a reporter’s error, the

any of these characteristics
were evidenced by the in-
dividuals responsible for the
bombing of Sigma Nu. I find it
unbelievable that White can
still consider himself worthy of
being a representative and
leader of his fellow students
after having been linked to this
atrocious affair. Further, I
believe that it is an insult to the
university and to the student
body. I want to be able to have

faith in the character of the in-
dividuals who make up the Ex-
ecutive Committee but James
White’s association with the
bombing of Sigma Nu makes it
impossible for me to have faith
in his. I hope he will answer this
call and be able to clear his
name and image. But if he can-
not, or does not, my next letter
will call for his resignation.

Ben St. Clair

Class of 1984

White asked to resign

To the Editors:

This year’s Executive Com-
mittee has been one which has
had to deal with very pivotal
issues concerning the well-
being of Washington and Lee.
Consequently, the committee
has fallen prey to widespread
and sharp criticism. I feel that
the E.C. has done remarkably
well in view of all that has hap-
pened, and they have proved
that we need responsible
representatives. This brings me
to the issue of James White and
the events surrounding his role
in the artillery simulator inci-
dent Fancy Dress weekend.
Aside from the fact that there is
no satisfactory explanation for
the bombing, it also presents
the question of Mr. White’s posi-
tion in the Executive Commit-
tee. Mr. White presently holds
the office of sophomore rep and
is the vice-presidential elect. In
my opinion, James White has
proven to the University that he
is quite capable of immaturity
and recklessness. He has also
proven that he is not at all wor-
thy of the position he now holds
on the E.C., as well as the posi-
tion to which he has been

elected. Our Executive Com-
mittee needs able leadership,
not irresponsibility. I therefore
call for the resignation of
James White on these grounds,
and I am certain that I am not
the only student who maintains
this demand. Maybe Mr. White
does have the ethics to at least
do the University this favor.

The artillery simulator that

-The Phi Delta Theta house
has become the subject of con-
troversy because of the inci-
dent. It and some of its mem-

bers have been punished for
throwing the simulator at the
Sigma Nu house. Those same
members, meanwhile, have
been victims of finger-pointing,
sneers and verbal assaults.
Ring-tum Phi Chief Editor
John Cleghorn is a Phi Delt.
That’s what journalists call a
conflict of interest — when
coverage of an event or organi-
zation is affected by the jour-

   

nalist’s personal involvement.
To readers it means the
possiblity of biased reporting
and slanted news. :

Cleghorn is no doubt embar-
rassed by the fact that his
fraternity is getting a lot of bad
press. He may be tempted to
soften that bad press or may
underplay the incident in order
to save his fraternity further
embarrassment. As chief editor
he has the authority to do that.
He may also lean the other way.
Conscious of the conflict of in-
terest, he may overplay the in-
cident to demonstrate that he’s
not afraid of giving Phi Delt
“‘bad press,” not afraid of sen-
sationalizing the sneers and
verbal assaults that have
resulted from the act.

Cleghorn himself probably
doesn’t know how or to what ex-
tent his involvement as a mem-
ber of Phi Delt has affected his
decisions concerning coverage
of events surrounding Phi Delt.
It may not have affected his
decisions at all. Indeed, the
coverage so far has seemed
fair, accurate and_ well-
balanced. But what’s important

 

is that there’s an appearance of
conflict, and appearance alone
is enough to make readers dis-
trust the credibility of the Phi’s
news reports. There’s a strong
suggestion of slanted news and
biased reporting in the mere
fact that Cleghorn is a member
of the fraternity that’s current-
ly making big headlines.

The Ring-tum Phi is lucky in
that it does have a safeguard
against such conflicts of in-
terest. The decision-making
duties are shared by Cleghorn,
co-Editor Rick Swagler and
News Editor Bruce Potter. If
one of them has a conflict, the
others can fill the decision-
making role.

Conflict of interest was
among several issues that arose
last weekend during the semi-
nar on the ethics of journalism.
Should journalists decide to
participate in activities and
organizations outside the
newsroom, the time may come
when they’ll have to report on
those organizations. That, in-
cidentally, is not a rare oc-
currence.

The purpose here is to avoid

 

Letters

Caruthers clarifies EC action

To the Editors:

Concerning Jim Sarle’s letter
three weeks ago about the In-
dependent Union and the E.C., I
at least can say I was informed
of it beforehand by Jim himself.
I was, however, surprised by its
content. After being appointed
ad-hoc member to the I.U.
(liason would be a better word),
I contacted Joe Cadle and also
spoke with Jim. Jim told me
that he had already submitted
his letter.

Anyway, the reason I was ap-
pointed as ad-hoc member was
because I am interested in the
cause of the I.U. I, as Jim
claimed, am not against the
I.U. but was, however, against

giving it any money under the
circumstances it was re-
quested. I don’t feel the E.C.
should create another S.A.B.
just for the independents but
rather should encourage the
S.A.B. to encompass all stu-
dents in its allotment of ac-
tivities, and I do not mean to
criticize the S.A.B. at all. The
I.U., however, should have col-
lected dues first in order to have
been able to show a firm com-
mitment before it requested
money. At the time, their
response to this suggestion was
why would anyone want to pay
dues to the I.U. when it may not
be around in a month or so. Our
concern lay in the fact that why
should the E.C. itself put money

into the I.U. if it wasn’t able to
prove its stability nor the com-
mitment by its members.
Nevertheless, I will easily be
able to work with Joe and Jim in
encouraging and collecting
ideas. (If anyone has any ideas,
please contact any or all three
of us.) Hopefully, the I.U. is go-
ing to be beginning a collection
of dues in order to show a firm
commitment. I think Jim and
Joe now know the true inten-
tions of the E.C. after talking
with me, and I want to assure
everyone that appointing an ad-
hoc member or liason was not
an abuse of power but rather a
helping hand.
Andrew Caruthers
Freshmen E.C. Representative

Brower calls for more cooperation

To the Editors:

Making clear a few, not so
well known facts, I would like to
help initiate some discussion
about our generally poor rela-
tionship with law _ students.
Before Lewis Hall was built, the
law students moved about the
undergraduate campus as the
fifth class. There was a good
academic relationship amongst
all the students of Washington
and Lee University, and there-
fore, the social relationships
developed more naturally and
without a great deal of effort by
either student level. Further-
more, law students predomi-
nantly served in one or several
of the Big Three positions of the
Executive Committee. There

was a great deal of respect

 

towards the law students from
undergraduates, and this seems
only natural, as these older
students were more mature and
had more to offer in life ex-
perience. Likewise, seniors
command more respect
amongst the undergraduate
school students as they sit at the
head of their peers. The gap
which presently exists is not on-
ly unnecessary, but it’s simply
a damn shame. There are many
law students who disagree with
having to exist at law school
under the Honor System, and I
can sympathize with the fact
that most of you lived at college
under similar honor systems.
If, however, we were to follow
the proposed example of the

University of Virginia, and

allow for the law school to write
its own consitution and have its
own EC, then we might as well
take out the bridge that joins
the two sides now. I am confi-
dent that we can work together
as a body of students who are
fortunate enough to attend
W&L, and hopefully through
friendly cooperation of our
class leaders, and individual ef-
forts, we will initiate better
social relationships again. We
as undergraduates have far too
much to learn from you, and
likewise, there is a great deal
that you can learn from us.
There is no reason that this
can’t work.

biased reporting, to be as objec-
tive as possible. That may be in
and of itself impossible. To be
completely objective means not
having any opinions, for even
opinions about organizations
and events can lead to biased
coverage.

So what’s a journalist suppos-
ed to do? Does he exclude him-
self from his community? Does
he abstain from joining
organizations? Does he not for-
mulate opinions? Is he not sup-
posed to think?

John Cleghorn could have
found himself in a tight position
had he been the only one on the
Phi staff with decision-making
power. As a member of Phi Delt
and as an editor forced to

decide how to play the Phi Delt
story, Cleghorn’s decision-
making effectiveness could
have become caught in the vise.

A conflict of this kind can
easily happen, with Cleghorn or
with anyone on the Phi staff.
The question is, as a responsible
journalist, do you anticipate a
possible conflict and cut your-
self off from all outside activi-
ty? Or do you deal with the con-
flicts as they come?

sion may have caused more

Northward bound

By MARKHAM SHAW PYLE
Phi Columnist

On the 2nd of February, a
crew of us piled into the cars
and floored it for Princeton,
New Jersey. It was an in-
teresting trip: a motorcade full
of unreconstructed. Confeder-
ates invading the North. I, for
example, had never been above
the Mason-Dixon before.
Something tells me that I could
have waited another two
decades. At least to see New
Jersey.

I suppose I should get the
matters of record out of the way
first, since even those happy

My View

few who saw the press release
have long forgotten it. Prince-
ton University and Community
College hosts every so often a
Model United Nations Con-
ference at which various
schools play the roles of the
member nations of the real
thing. The model isn’t quite as

_ funny as the real thing, of

course, but they do their best.

We had been coquettish about
this, on the grounds that we had
such a long way to go to get to
Princeton. We told them they’d
have to make it worth our while.
So they gave us the United
States. Panic. The panic in-
creased when we found out that
West Point had been assigned
the USSR. Them people is
mean.

Yours truly ended up as Chief
of Mission. This meant that I
got to sit on the General
Assembly and defend the
United States from all sorts of
attacks. Everybody and their
dog — meaning USSR and
Libya — got in on the act. I
regret to say that everyone
played their parts with great
glee. The last time I saw that
many people in one room cut-
ting down America was in the

faculty lounge..

The reason we refer to this
among ourselves as OPERA-
TION BIG MAGNOLIA is sim-
ple. Old Virginny cleaned up
that weekend. UVa had been
given the role of Her Majesty’s
Government and poured tea so
nicely that they won, deserved-
ly, first place as a delegation.
There are those who suggested
that UVa was perfect for the
role of Great Britain, given that
Charlottesville is the last col-
ony. Three cheers for King
George.

Taking fourth place overall
was the Federal Republic of
Germany, played ably by VMI.
These boys were more than
happy to accept the Pershing
missiles we promised ‘em. I
just don’t see what the fuss is
about.

Hampden-Sydney was Peru.

We took third overall as a
delegation. Jon Zagrodsky ran
the Western Summit meeting
like a Punch and Judy show.
Not even Canada gave the U.S.
any lip. He got a personal first
place out of that one. Lawton
Jackson got a second in his
main committee, against over-
whelming odds. I won
something or other myself. Be-
tween the Virginia colleges,
there were a total of about fif-
teen awards of one sort or
another. Count in Duke and the
Tarheels, and the South had
risen indeed.

But the fascinating thing
about the Conference was the
stuff behind the proverbial
scenes. The drive up was our
first clue. The federal govern-
ment has to have chosen the in-
terstate routes with a view to
seeing just how ugly it could
make them. It must have re-
quired deliberate effort to route
the interstates through country
that awful. The only thing to
relieve the monotony of the
poisoned land is the succession
of chemical plants that speeds
past the car windows. Why, we

A proposed reorganization of
the Student Activities Board
would give it a board of direc-
tors structure that would decen-
tralize responsibility in the
group.

The Executive Committee en-
dorsed the concept Monday in
what it called ‘‘a non-binding
general consensus’’ and asked
that a more detailed plan be
submitted to it next week.

The change was proposed by
Burford Smith, a vice-chairman
of the SAB, and John Haywood,
the organization’s treasurer.

If the revision were enacted,
the group would be headed by a
chairman, under whom would

be an executive director.

He would be in charge of six
directors responsible for
specific areas of SAB activity:
entertainment/bands, enter-
tainment/weekends, opera-
tions, publicity, outing/recrea-
tion and films/special events.

Smith said that the reorgani-
zation would ‘“‘almost double the
number of people with im-
mediate input.’’

“Right now, we have a staff of
40 or 50 people, but we haven’t
been able to organize them or
provide enough work for them,’’
Haywood said. —

“Under the new plan, com-
mittee members would feel
they have input and are making
contributions,’’ he said.

“Right now we have a pro-

blem getting them to work
—there’s some hesitation. I
can’t say that I blame them.”

Smith said that the reorgani-
zation would also allow the SAB
to expand its program.

“As it stands now with
responsibility concentrated,
there’s more work than we can
handle,”’ he said.

“‘We want to fulfill the obliga-
tions we have that everyone is
talking about. But the way it’s
set up now, if we started doing
other things, the SAB would
begin to fall apart.”’

Haywood said the new struc-
ture would allow the group to
‘‘do what we do now, only a lit-
tle more effectively.”’ In addi-
tion he said it would ‘‘allow us to
look at a much broader pic-
ture.”’

“Everyone isn’t satisfied,”’ he
said. ‘If they were, we wouldn’t
see these special interest
groups forming, like the In-
dependent Union.” ;

Law grad becomes assistant dean

M. Patricia Walther, current-
ly a staff counselor for the Na-
tional Labor Relations Board in
Washington, has been ap-
pointed assistant dean of
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s School of Law.

Walther’s appointment was
announced by W&L law school
dean Frederic L. Kirgis Jr.,
who also announced that Ed-
ward O. Henneman, assistant
dean since 1981, will return to
full-time teaching in the law
school while also occupying a
newly created position of
associate dean.

Walther will concentrate on -

admissions and financial aid
matters with some responsibili-
ty for student counseling in her
role as assistant dean, Kirgis
said. She will assume her duties
July 1.

In the new position of
associate dean, Henneman will
deal with student affairs,

primarily involving the inter-
pretation and application of
academic rules.

“I am delighted that we are
making these two appoint-
ments,” Kirgis said. ‘Pat
Walther distinguished herself
as a student here at Washington
and Lee, and I am confident she
will approach this new assign-
ment with skill and enthusiasm.
Her presence will allow Ned
Henneman to return his full
concentrations to the classroom
while also providing valuable
assistance to me in other impor-
tant areas.”

Walther received the juris
doctor degree from the W&L
School of Law in 1983. She is a
1979 graduate of Duke Universi-
ty.
While at W&L, she was presi-
dent of the Women Law Stu-
dents’ Organization, served in
the Legal Aid Society and was
on the W&L Law Review.

SNu decides
to drop issue

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

The members of Sigma Nu
voted Monday night not to take
any further action in the recent
incident involving two mem-
bers of Phi Delta Theta.

On March 3, an artillery
simulator was thrown from the
Phi Delt house across the street
into the Sigma Nu yard. Sopho-
mores Frank Surface and
James White have admitted in-
volvement in the action.

“‘We do not intend to press
charges at this time,’’ Sigma
Nu President Chris John said
after presiding over an hour-
long debate on the subject.

Phi Delt was given two weeks
of social probation for the inci-
dent, and the students were
each given four weeks of social
probation and will not be per-
mitted to live in the fraternity
house during spring term.

The Student Control Commit-
tee, which levied the penalties,
also instructed the two to pay
for the repair of the damage to
the Sigma Nu House and to
make a personal apology to the
members of the house. ~

Surface and White appeared
before Monday’s meeting of
Sigma Nu and offered an
apology which John said was
satisfactory. Sigma Nu has
been reimbursed for the
damage.

White, a member of the Ex-
ecutive Committee and the vice
president-elect of the student
body, said that the artillery
simulator was purchased at a
public gun show in Texas.

“It was sold as a novelty
item, a prankster-like device,
so I thought it was no big deal,”
White said Tuesday.

“T can see myself at fault for
giving it to Frank,’’ he said. “I
figured he would do something
with it related to its intent as a
novelty-type item. I shouldn’t
have given it tohim.”’

“This thing has just snowball-
ed on me,” he continued. ‘It
was an honest mistake. It

wasn’t meant as an aggression
against the Sigma Nus.”’

“The problem is that it was
louder than anyone expected,
especially myself,’ he added.
“It surprised the hell out of
me.”

White said that because he
purchased the device at a public
exhibition, he didn’t realize that
there was anything improper
about possessing it.

“I don’t want to have any part
of anything illegal,’’ he said.

“If I had any idea that there
were any illegal implications to
it, I'd have thrown it in the gar-
bagecan.”’

Capt. Robert R. Ripple, a
military science professor, is an
engineer who says he works fre-
quently with devices such as the
artillery simulator. He provid-
ed “‘expert testimony’’ to the
Student Control Committee.

“An artillery simulator is a
large firecracker,’ he said in
an interview. “It is not an ex-
plosive device.”

“It can do no more damage
than a normal large fire-
cracker,” he continued. “It is
made to be used against people,
although you’re not supposed to
come into direct contact with it.

“If you’re not in direct con-
tact with it, there’s no danger to
you.”

According to Ripple, an ar-
tillery simulator is ‘flash
powder tightly wrapped in card-
board. It whistles and is quite
loud.”’

John said the debate at Mon-
day’s Sigma Nu meeting ‘‘got
pretty heated,’’ and that the
vote not to take further action
was not unanimous.

‘Many people are concerned
about what to do about this
situation,’ he said. ‘‘We don’t
see it as an isolated incident.”’

He said there have been a
number of incidents of harrass-
ment between the members of
the two houses. The problem,
according to John, is with in-
dividuals in the fraternity, not
with the Phi Delt leadership.

The managing editor of The
Philadelphia Inquirer told an
audience at Washington and
Lee University’s 10th annual
Journalism Ethics Institute on
Friday that ‘by needlessly
resorting to unnamed sources”’
journalists undermine their
credibility and reduce their ef-
fectiveness.

Gene Foreman presented the
keynote address for the three-
day institute in which W&L
students were joined by pro-
fessors and practicing jour-
nalists for sessions on a wide
range of topics. The institute is
part of Washington and Lee’s
program in applied ethics,
“Society and the Professions.’’

Citing his concern about
credibility in the journalism
profession, Foreman said, ‘“The
heavy reliance on unnamed
sources in our news stories is
engendering suspicion and
distrust among our readers. By
the very act of taking others in-
to our confidence, we strain the
confidence our readers have in
us.””

In addition to inviting
distrust, Foreman noted that
such “blind” sources expose
journalists to other dangers, in-
cluding the threat of defama-
tion suits or even criminal cita-
tions for the failure to reveal a
source.

Despite his concern over the
use of confidential sources,
Foreman would not suggest
that editors simply ban their
use.

“Our mission is to serve as a
conduit of information to our
readers,’’ Foreman said. “That
flow of information would be
greatly diminished if we flatly
ordered our reporters not to
write what they cannot at-

 

“If the public
doesn’t _ believe
what we’re publish-

ing, then it’s logi-
cal to expect its
next step will be to
stop buying what
we print.”

 

tribute by name and title.”’

Instead, Foreman offered six
guidelines that he feels should
be used in deciding whether to
use an unnamed source:

eAn unnamed source should
be a last resort, not an easy
alternative.

elt should be clear that the
source’s physical or economic
well-being might be jeopardized
if his or her name is revealed.

eThe information provided by

anunnamed  urce must be es-
sential to an...iportant story.

To help readers evaluate the
information, unnamed sources
should be described as fully as
possible without giving away
their identity.

elf an unnamed source is
quoted making derogatory
statements about someone,
such a statement must be one
that enhances the public’s
understanding of a crucial
issue. Further, the statement
should be corroborated by
public record or named
sources.
~ eReporters have to be free to
use their judgment in granting
confidentiality but must be ex-
pected to identify sources to
their editors.

Foreman said that while the
journalism profession has
become more sophisticated in
the last generation, readers
have also become more sophis-
ticated. The readers’ skep-
ticism is heightened by jour-
nalists’ use of unnamed
sources, he said.

“Truth, after all, is our basic
commodity. If the public
doesn’t believe what we’re pub-
lishing, then it’s logical to ex-
pect its next step will be to stop
buying what we _ print,”
Foreman said.

‘Hunger hurts’

Group plans famine to raise money

Along the Colonnade of Wash-
ington and Lee University you
see the familiar sight of

students making their way to.

class. But on this morning you
notice a button on a student’s
lapel. It strikes you as odd
because it does not say ‘‘Vote’’
or “Smile”; rather, it says
“Hunger Hurts.”’

The hunger this button refers
to is real. The students wearing
these buttons are going to feel
the hurt of hunger as they fast
March 23 to 24 for the cause of
world hunger. Each student will
skip three meals between Fri-
day noon and Saturday evening.
Those unable to participate are
encouraged to sponsor a famine
participant by contributing $2
per meal skipped.

What good is this small
measure of charity? It may
seem that only a few dollars will
be raised, not nearly enough to
be of any real help; but that is
only one aspect of their mission.
They also wish to raise aware-
ness of the world’s starving peo-
ple. ‘‘After all,”’ a past famine
participant said, ‘‘hunger is 100
percent curable.”

Chaplain Charles C. Caudill of
Virginia Military Institute is in
charge of the Planned Famine
for Washington and Lee and
VMI. ‘‘We plan for those par-
ticipating in the program to
share in the experience of feel-
ing hungry, to learn why hunger
exists in the world and to find
out what we can do about it,”
said Caudill.

Perhaps they will learn to cut
down on food waste. Research-
ers who dug through garbage
cans in a medium-sized city in
the U.S. found up to 3,000
pounds of edible meat dumped
each week.

The practical side of this fast

is that some who otherwise
would have died from hunger
will be saved.

The money from the Planned
Famine will go to Ethiopia,
which has been experiencing
severe droughts since the early
1970s. The lack of rain has
depleted water supplies needed
for both drinking and hygiene.
In addition to malnutrition, the
children suffer from skin and
eye infections.

Dr. Tony Atkins, director of
relief and rehabilitation for
World Vision, the sponsoring
organization, went to Gondar
and Shewa, Ethiopia. “I have
seen many situations of disease
among infants and children,”
he said, ‘‘but I cannot recollect
a scene quite like this — so
pitiful in the’ numbers of
children affected so seriously
by malnutrition,”’ he said.

World Vision International
has been around for 34 years
and reaches more than 70 coun-
tries. Last year 79 percent of its
money went toward direct relief
services,

World Vision will use the
money from planned famines
throughout Virginia for faffa, a
nutritional supplement of grain
and powdered milk produced in
Ethiopia; clothing and blan-
kets; an Ethiopian medical
team; and the maintenance of
an aircraft used to deliver daily
food and medicine to areas in-
accessible by trucks.

The planned famine in Virgin-
ia is expected to raise $50,000
from the 10 to 15 schools involv-
ed. “It is only a drop in the
ocean, but it is a beginning that
will help,” said Atkins.

‘Let not the slight be slighted’

Former professor Charles Turner’s

Old Zeus: Life and Letters
(1860-62) of James J. White.
Charles W. Turner. McClure
Press, Verona, Va. 1983. 110. pp
text. Indexed. Illustrations.
By MARKHAM SHAW PYLE
Phi Columnist

Every few years or so, the
select public for whom he
writes receives from Mr.
Turner another slim volume of
reminisces private or histories
public. Like fireflies, these
scarce sparks from a swift pen
flash briefly, illuminating the
small and homelike, and so are
gone. These are books of a sum-
mer dusk.

Let not the slight be slighted.
There is a place for the quiet
and local. It is from love of the
immediate and familiar that we
proceed to the progressively
wider affections of society and
mankind. So saith the prophet
Edmund Burke. Was this not St.

Hinely )

 

James’ point: No man can love
so transcendent and oceanic be-
ing as the Deity, who cannot be
charitable to his laundress, his
maiden aunt and the young cou-
ple down the street whose Lab
tears into the garbage punctual-
ly every Monday at dawn.

In Charles Turner, as his
students will attest, we have a
master of detail. History is an
accumulation of detail. The
broad sweeps of Gibbon or
Macaulay’s brush, the expan-
sive strokes of Churchill and
Toynbee: all paint fiction if the
details be ignored.

Old Zeus is a life of Captain
White, officer in the Liberty
Hall Volunteers of the Stonewall
Brigade. His captaincy is
salient: while his lasting

—albeit local — fame was based
on his career as Professor of
Greek here at W&L, his
military career was the im-

petus for his becoming Robert
E. Lee’s closest confidant in the
Washington College years.

This in turn led to his appoint-
ment as acting president be-
tween the General’s death and
Custis Lee’s confirmation as his
successor; and to his role as the
younger Lee’s prime minister
during his presidency. So we
have in Turner brief lights of a
man whose father was pastor of
Lexington Presbyterian before
the War, and after whom White
Street is named; a man who
served Washington College
under Hamilton Junkin; a man
of letters caught up in a battle,
and the indispensable aide-de-
camp of a warrior-educator.
The subject alone would justify
the work.

Now, this is by no means a
perfect volume. There is first of
all a problem of editing. As for
the copy-editing the lapses,

while trying, are excusable; for
is not this the curse of small im-
prints, private presses and local
publishers? More vexing is the
thicket of footnotes through
which the text creeps. The com-
plaint is not, however, devas-
tating; for the text of those foot-
notes is a treasure chest of the
piquant, the interesting and the
downright amusing.

These are minor cavils. Only
slightly more important is the
question of Mr. Turner’s own
style: Again, this is in large part
the fault of the circumstances
that deprived the book of the
sort of editing secured to an
author by a larger house. This
work came forth unmidwifed.
Mr. Turner’s style is not at all
poor; rather, too long contact
with the Victorian sentence
(White’s are exemplary of the
contemporary trend toward fus-
tian) has left his own diction ac-

look at a Civil War captain shows mastery of detail

cordingly overstuffed.

But it is padded with goodly
things. In the career of Captain
White is reflected the times of
his class and area. We see a
president who failed, sundered
from his students by the dif-
ferences of a coming war, and

another, his successor, who
healed a nation from a small
college in an undistinguished
town. We see young ploughboys
and classics students fighting
the invader side by side and
oecome disillusioned with the
glory of war. Like an academic
Candide, White strolls bewil-
dered through bitter times; and
Turner leads us in tracking him
diligently through it all. For
those who can feel any interest
in men caught up in great
events, this work is a rich vein
of worthy information, pleasing
to the sense of home and history
alike.

VASAP for Dudley ?

When was the last time. you
saw Dudley Moore sober in a
movie? Well, if you discount
his role in Six Weeks(the movie
equivalent of overdosing on

never.

I for one am becoming a little
weary of watching little Dudley
stagger all over the screen,
which comprised the majority
of the action in Unfaithfully

At the risk of sounding chau-
vinistic, I did love Natassja Kin-
ski as her usual pouty, sensual
persona. So who cares if she
isn’t the most convincing
Italian wife (she just can’t seem
to shake her father Klause’s ac-
cent), she could have played an
Albanian dish washer with
about the same results.

Another mark against the
movie is the appearance of Ar-
mande Assante as Maximillian
Stein, maestro Claude East-
man’s (Dudley Moore) cello-
playing protege. Assante is too
cool, macho, and Frenchy for
my taste. (Where’s Charles

mind.

My recommendation to the

much more of Nastassja and
nothing remotely resembling

The secret of Old Main revealed

By EDDIE CURRAN
Staff Reporter

I’m going to venture to guess
that a large number of Phi
readers have never heard of, or
at least never been to, the Old
Main Sandwich and Cheese
Shoppe, and further, that some
of you who have experienced
Old Main sandwiches never-
theless forget to consider Old
Main at that precious moment
when you decide what you’re in
the mood for: Arby’s, Lloyd’s,
the Co-op...Arby’s, Lloyd’s, the
Co-op....still no enthusiasm.
But, if you’re lucky, somewhere

The
Eat Beat

in that vast expanse of grey
matter those brain cells assign-
ed to Old Main will assert them-
selves. The act of remembering
Old Main is like answering a dif-
ficult question in Trivial Pur-
suit (to me it is anyway). With

both there is the actual sensa- —

tion of the brain at work, and
the realization that in some
small way you’ve gone beyond
the call of mediocrity. Best of
all, the sandwich you get will
probably be even more satisfy-
ing than the fleeting sense of
your own total awareness.

The reason Old Main is secret
to some and forgettable to
others is only because of its
location. Since it can’t be seen
from the street, or from outside,
for that matter, there is nothing
physical to remind you of it. It’s
inside the Old Main Street Mall,
at 29 N. Main St., across from
where White Columns used to
be and catty-corner to Red
Square. ‘or those of you who
get your hair styled at Marie’s
instead of simply cut, you’ll
know that the Sandwich Shoppe
is in the back of the Mall, to the

right.

A quick word on the mall — if
you’ve never been, you owe
yourself a trip. On the outside it
appears to be a big, non-
descript red brick building, yet
the inside is one of the most
charming sights in Lexington.
When I first went there a few
years ago I was very pleasantly
surprised — it reminded me of
the kind of clean, cute little
village streets found in Disney
World, but with the accent on in-
nocence rather than commer-
cialism. Small stores run by
ladies selling gifts, oriental
rugs, satin and lace, etc — not
the kinds of things you’re likely
to buy, but the stores and the
street signs give the mall a
dreamy, escapist feel.

Sitting at the tables outside
the Sandwich Shoppe, with the
sun coming through the glass
roof and the sound of the water
fountain in the background, I
was reminded of the porch
restaurants in the French Quar-
ter of New Orleans, sort of
relaxing and festive at the same
time. Now on to the sandwiches,
what you came for in the first
place.

The Old Main menu lists
specialties and popular com-
binations, but it’s good to keep
in mind that you can make
alterations to suit your taste.
For instance, the Combination
No. 2 is corned beef, pastrami,
and imported swiss with cole
slaw and dressing on a Vienna
roll. I get it without the cole
slaw, and with mayonnaise and
mustard instead of dressing,
and I’m very satisfied.
Everybody’s got their own
sandwich eating peculiarities
—some people don’t like mayo,
or mustard, and I don’t happen
to like anything sweet, like
dressing or Miracle Whip. And
the good thing about Old Main is
that they have quality in-
gredients — you can tell they
don’t walk around Kroger with

versity Theatre production of

son of Katonah, N.Y., and first-

year W&L law student Ann —

New band plays Cockpit

One of the newest additions to
the Washington and Lee rock
scene, the ‘Missing Minks,”’
will play in the Cockpit this Fri-
day at 9 p.m. The sextet is com-
posed of freshmen Steve Doran
(manager and vocals), Tom
Maurer (keyboards, vocals),
John D. Wheeler (guitar,
vocals) and Chris Fure (bass.
vocals), along with seniors

Barthe van Doorn (drums) and
Todd Ford (guitar, vocals).
“‘We’re looking to play as
many places in the college area
as possible,” says Doran. The
sextet, formerly known as ‘“‘The
College Boys,”’ was founded in
December and put on its first
performance at the Mary
Baldwin College Pub on Jan. 26.

a shopping cart. The meat isn’t
processed, the cheese comes
from Switzerland, and the
bread tastes homemade. The
Vienna roll is especially good;
it’s chewy, and you have to tug
a little, which is a sign of quality
bread.

Judging from the people I
talked to, the Barbeque Beef
Hero and the Old Main Club are
‘the two most popular sand-
wiches. The Old Main Club is
my second favorite Old Main
sandwich. It’s packed high with
turkey, ham, roast beef, let-
tuce, and mayonnaise. One
source considered it a stroke of
genius that they put it on
Pumpernickel, and I couldn’t
help but agree. I didn’t like the

Barbeque as much, but this is
because I’ve never liked the
way bread tasted when it was
soaked with barbeque sauce.
Write this off as my problem,
for I heard a lot of high praise
for this one. My favorite was the
combination No. 3, with ham,
turkey breast, melted swiss,
and mayo served hot on a Vien-
na roll. Old Main steams their
sandwiches, and this gives
them a melty cohesiveness
which works best on the Vienna
rolls. And for dessert, they have
the best cheesecake in town
— heavy and creamy and moist
whatever on top of a thick
crumb crust.

As well as having good food
and a nice atmosphere, Old

Main is inexpensive, with all the
sandwiches costing about two
dollars. And the two girls that
work there are talkative and
personable. As I was eating my
sandwiches, in walked none
other than Markham Pyle, who
made his regular order, a Taco
Hero, hold the tomato and
heavy on the peppers. Never at
a loss for words, fellow chow-
hound Markham quoth, ‘‘I have
nothing but good to say of the
place. The service is always
cheerful, the food’s great,
reasonable, and it’s a_ full
meal.’’ That about says it.

Next week, the Eat Beat in-
vestigates a mysterious case of
sea sickness in land-locked Lex-
ington.

Student art displayed in duPont

By SCOTT PRYSI
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee’s annual
Spring Student Art Show is cur-
rently on exhibit in duPont
Gallery. The show includes a
variety of mixed media sculp-
ture, paintings, drawings,
prints and photographs repre-
senting the efforts of nearly 50
W&L art students.

The broad range of styles and
techniques involved in the ex-
hibit lends diversity to the more
than 100 pieces on display. Of
note in water color are Warren
Watkins’ frosty ‘‘Virginia
Winter,’’ Elizabeth Shields’ col-
orful “Spring Melt” and Donald
Smith’s clean and simple
Chinese brush painting, ‘Bird
and Pine Tree.” George Finly’s
ambitious work ‘‘One Night”’ is
one of the few oil paintings on
display, but it ably demon-
strates the depth and latitude of

compostion possible in this
medium.
Several interesting small

drawings in pencil and ink are
being shown. In this category

the work of Jeff Hubbard and -

David Buschman stands out.
Hubbard’s ‘“‘Governor’s Man-
sion” and ‘“‘Colonnade”’ in pen
and ink are finely drawn minia-
tures notable for their clean
detail. Buschman’s pencil
drawing ‘Grandfather Cole-
man” and his pen and ink “Bird
of Paradise’ are superbly ex-
ecuted and contain the best
detail of any drawings. Other
works of high quality are Dun-
can Stone’s “Untitled Nude’’
and Erich Anspach’s ‘Grace
Kelly.”

For the pastel enthusiast
there are Jim Farthing’s strong
and colorful ‘‘Jennifer’s’’ and
Michael Bayer’s bucolic work

“The Valley.”
Sculpture works abound in
the exhibit. Several of the

larger pieces incorporate a
lush, polished dark wood with
brass and iron. Two of Ross
Lynde’s works dominate the
front of the gallery. ‘“‘Working
No. 1” and “Working No. 2”
demonstrate fine craftsman-
ship and imagination. An unti-
tled neon, glass and metal piece
by Lewis Allen at the gallery’s

entrance is also superb. A new
room at the rear of the gallery
contains many more
fascinating sculpture pieces
and should not be overlooked.

The works of two seniors,
Steve Brooks and Charles
Mason, round out the show.
Brooks’ mixed media ‘‘Base-
ment Byzantine”’ brings colored
cloth, paint, wood and plastic
together to create one of the
best pieces in the show. He has
successfully incorporated the
techniques of several modern
American artists into a
cohesive and intriguing whole.
Mason’s photographs, taken
with a Polaroid SX-70 Land
Camera, are also superb. He
shows an innate talent for this
relatively new and growing
field of expression, and we will
undoubtedly see and hear more
of him in the future.

There will be a reception in
the gallery to honor the artists
on Friday, March 23, from 3-5
p.m. It is open to the public, and
beer and chips will be provided.

The show will remain in du-
Pont through March 30.

By MIKE ALLEN

In Vegas, they say that
nothing is less certain than a
sure thing.

Well, politics is the world’s
biggest crap shoot, and Tues-
day night Walter Mondale had a
new idea — winning a primary.

Ten days ago, on the night of
Super Tuesday, it was to the
theme song of “Rocky” that
Gary Hart entered the ballroom
of the Washington hotel where
his supporters were gathered.

The next day, apparently una-
ware of the senator’s serenade,
- Mondale said on television that
‘Rocky’ is the story of a
fighter who fights back.”

On Tuesday night he did just
that with a crucial victory in Il-
linois.

Dorothy Lynch, Hart’s poll-
ster, said on the “CBS Morning
News’’ on the morning of Super
Tuesday, “As people get to
know him, they’re going to like
him even better.”

Well, familiarity breeds con-
tempt, not confidence, and the
unrelenting scrutiny Hart has

analyst for the Mock Con-
vention.

received in the last few weeks
apparently hurt him on Tues-
day.

Ever since Mondale learned
that he couldn’t take New
Hampshire for granite, the
former vice president has been
campaigning intensely, and it
paid off for him this week.

For most of us, Saturday was
St. Patrick’s Day, but Mondale
campaign staffers called it
‘“‘The Day Without Shame.”’

Sporting a kelly green tie,
Walter O’Mondale made an ap-
pearance before a group of
Chicago’s Irish citizens.

Later, he spoke at a gathering
of the city’s Polish residents. In
an effort to turn Illinois into the
Land of Linkin’, Mondale at-
tempted to associate labor sup-
port for his candidacy with
Lech Walesa and Solidarity.

“I’ve been criticized a little
bit for having union support,”
he said in the understatement of
the hour.

No one is mocking the Mock
Convention now — Political
Director Jack Dent reports that
its strategists were correct on
six out of seven races last week.

It’s getting easier as the field
narrows. Virginia is holding its

biology professor John S. Knox
seeking information about
whether honey could be con-
taminated by coming in contact
with marijuana.
Knox said it was his under-
standing that drug investiga-
tions had revealed that some

county residents were storing
their marijuana in beehives.

He said it was unclear
whether the prosecutor was try-
ing to determine if the honey in
beehives used for such storage

purposes could be tainted, or
whether bees carrying pollen
from marijuana plants could
contaminate honey.

He and chemistry professor
J. Keith Shillington declined to
perform the test.

‘I wouldn’t attempt to do it,
because it would take a very
long time to do with any relia-
bility,” Knox said. ‘I couldn’t
figure out why he came to me
for this.”’

The intern, senior Anthony In-
terante, said that office matters
were confidential and that he
could not discuss the incident.

caucuses over this weekend,
and this was supposed to be a
very good state for John Glenn,
the first astronaut to splash
down without ever taking off.

On March 12, shortly before
Glenn withdrew, Gov. Charles
Robb, who had endorsed him,
sent letters to potential Glenn
delegates, urging them to re-
main uncommitted since it
would give the state some
leverage in the event of a
“‘brokered”’ convention.

The Connecticut primary is
Tuesday, and its Senator
Christopher Dodd has endorsed
Hart. It may be out of self-
interest that many dodd-in-the-
wool Connecticut loyalists vote
for Hart, since their senator
seems to have at least an inside
track on the vice presidential
post.

On March 10, at the time that
Dodd endorsed him, Hart told
the audience: “‘I will find ways
of expressing my appreciation
to Chris later. At the very least,
let me.say that we will have
some lengthy opportunities
over lunch and dinner in the
White House to discuss Connec-
ticut’s problems.”

Caucuses will be held Satur-
day in Kansas, the home state
of Gary Hart (of course that
wasn’t his name then, but you
know whoI mean).

Your past can come back to
haunt you, as Hart discovered
last week when The Wall Street
Journal paid a visit to his high
school in Ottawa, Kansas, and
found out about the time that he
cheated ona chemistry test.

‘He was indiscreet,’’ Lester
Hoffman, Hart’s chemistry
teacher, told the Journal. ‘‘He
and a friend broke into my
classroom at night and took a
copy of the examination. They
were C students, and they got
almost letter-perfect answers to
the 50 questions on that quiz. I
was suspicious, and I found out
what happened.”

It seems Hart started getting
away with things even then. “I

went to the principal,’’ Hoffman
continued, “and he said he
wouldn’t graduate either one of
them. But I said I would put
aside that exam and average
out all the others, and give them
that grade. That way, they both
got C’s. They never came to talk
to me about it.”

It doesn’t seem like that is the
only time that Hart has purloin-
ed ideas. As I read over his
issue positions, I’m reminded of
the comment which a producer
being interviewed on CBS’s ‘‘60
Minutes’”’ last Sunday made
about one of next season’s
television shows: “It’s new
because it’s new for the second
time.”

To make up for his Illinois
loss, you can be certain that
“Gary’s guerillas,’ as _ his
volunteers are called, will be
working in overdrive.

Funds will also be important.
New, special phone lines have
been set up for those wishing to
contribute: 1-800-USA-HART.
Don’t all dial at once, now.

Did you catch the television
coverage of Tuesday’s Illinois
primary? If you were in the
Cockpit, here’s what you miss-
ed

Network anchors can’t afford
to offend any viewers. ABC’s
Peter Jennings explained the
shading on a delegate map ‘‘for
those with non-color television
sets.”

In an interview with Dan
Rather of CBS, Hart said, ‘“‘If I
make only two mistakes in this
campaign, that’s a pretty good
record.’’ Fine. When should we
start counting?

Mondale, in an interview with
Roger Mudd of NBC: “I want to
compliment Sen. Hart and Rev.
Jackson on a good race.”’ Can
you spell ‘‘patronizing’’?

It’s hard to keep all the titles
straight. Jennings pointed out
the delegate count of ‘‘Senator
Mondale”’ (he was, once), and
Cable News Network’s Bernard
Shaw referred to ‘‘former
Senator Hart.”’ |

sion commercial on the air. The

the memorable phrase from it

‘Gary Hart is blown away in the Windy City

would be “‘big fluffy bun.”

Mar. 1 — Sweet Briar’s paper
runs an editorial about the non-
responsiveness of the adminis-
tration which they title
“‘Where’s the Beef?’’ Clever.

Mar. 2-3 — At Fancy Dress,
W&L men who can’t find their

peatedly asking their friends,
‘“‘Where’s the beef?”

Mar. 10 — At a labor rally in
Illinois, AFL-CIO president
Lane Kirkland says: ‘You can
apply the burger test to Hart.
It’s a big bun, but where’s the
beef?”

Mar. 11 — On the advice of
campaign manager Robert
Beckel, Mondale says to Hart in
the Atlanta debate, “When I
hear your new ideas, I’m
reminded of that ad, ‘Where’s
the beef?’ ”’

Mar. 21 — On CNN’s “‘News-
night,’’ columnist Robert
Novak says of the ‘‘Where’s the
beef?” line: ‘‘I don’t think it’s
dignified. I don’t think it’s very
catchy. I think it’s a little tired
at this point.”

Amen!

Here’s the political outlook
for the next week as seen by
Mock Convention researchers:

KANSAS (C) — Hometown
boy Hart by a slim margin.
Mondale has spent a lot of
money in the state, and has had
an organization in place for a
year.

MONTANA (C) — Hart by a
hair. The state has strong con-
nections with Minnesota, which
helps Mondale.

VIRGINIA (C) — Southern
regional chairman Gene Wood
reports that the uncommitteed
slate will beat Mondale by a
razor’s edge. Hart will run well
in Northern Virginia, and
Jackson has bult a quite respec-
table organization in the state.

CONNECTICUT (P) —
Although popular widom (read:
network divination) says the
state is a Hart stronghold, the
Mock Convention has concluded
that Mondale will win by a slim
margin. Independent voters, a
usual source of strength for
Hart, are not allowed to vote in
the primary, and labor is -well
organized to support (en-
force?) the unions’ endorse-
ment of Mondale.

Six claim A-A honors

The hard work and
perseverance has paid off in
very large dividends for the
Washington and Lee swim
team. The Generals broke six
school records and six in-
dividuals earned All-America
status as W&L came in 15th
(out of 75 schools) at the NCAA
Division III Championships at
Emory University last week-
end.

“It was the best possible way
for the team to finish,’ said
W&L aquatics director Page
Remillard. ‘‘We’ve been work-
ing extremely hard since the
beginning of school and the
hard work has paid off.”

The six All-Americans are
senior Tim Rock, who swam the
1,650-yard freestyle in a time of
16:19.19 to finish 8th; freshman
Jay ReVille, who covered the
400-yard individual medley in a
shool-record 4:08.59 to finish
7th; junior Bobby Pearson,
senior Gary Meyer and sopho-
more Tim Stanford, who team-
ed with ReVille to break the
school record in the 800-free
relay with a time of 6:59.98 to
finish 8th; and Taber Smith,
who anchored the 400-free relay
team, with Pearson, Meyer and
Stanford, which finished 8th and
broke the school record with a
time of 3:09.04. All finishes in
the top 12 at the nationals earn
All-America status.

The Generals also broke three
school records that did not
break into the top 12 times.

ReVille swam the 200-yard in-
dividual medley in 1:58.95 and
finished 20th. Stanford covered
the 100-yard butterfly in 51.8
seconds to finish 14th and the
200-yard butterfly in 1:56.53 to
finish 20th.

“I’m extremely happy for all
six, but it is really gratifying to
see the seniors, Rock and
Meyer, go out in style,” said
Remillard. ‘Both of them had
outstanding careers and de-
served everything they got.’”’

Rock, who came in 5th in the
1,650 as a freshman to earn All-
America status, came full cir-
cle by making it again and
beating his freshman time as a
senior. ‘‘He finished his sculp-
ture. It was a perfect ending for
him. He set his goal to make it
again and he achieved it in
great style,’’ said Remillard.

Meyer, W&L’s lone All-
America last year, capped off
his career with four All-
America awards. He was also
part of W&L’s fourth-place 400-
relay team in 1982.

Stanford was nearly perfect.
He swam four races and had
two individual school records
and was a part of two relay
records.

ReVille, who also swam in
four events, showed that he has
the potential to be a great swim-
mer. ‘He has the talent and the
desire and could be a four-year
All-America,” said Remillard.

Smith and Pearson swam per-
sonal bests in their relay efforts

and earned their first All-
America awards.

“These guys should be proud
of what they have achieved.
They not only wanted to do well

. for themselves, but they wanted

to represent the school and their
teammates and put W&L back
on the swimming map. I feel
that they have done all of that
and more,” said Remillard.

Track dominates opening foes

By MICHAEL MCALLISTER
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
track and field team jumped out
of the blocks quickly this season
by establishing a 3-0 record with
some very impressive victories.

On St. Patrick’s Day, the
Generals traveled to North
Carolina and opened the 1984
season with a dominating 99-39
win over Davidson. By winning
12 of 17 events, W&L proved to
be much too powerful for the
Wildcats.

Junior captain Chris Ives was
the highlight of the meet, cap-
turing the 100-meter dash, the
110-meter high hurdles and the
400-meter hurdles to win a triple
for the Generals.

“For an early meet we per-
formed well,” said head coach
Norris Aldridge. ‘‘It was a team
effort in every respect. We had
nine different winners and
many second and third places.”

Aldridge also noted that
Davidson has been better in the
past, and that the Generals are
going to see tougher competi-
tion as the season progresses.

Besides Ives, W&L got win-
ning efforts from Billy
Rhinehart in the triple jump,
John Burlingame in the long
jump, Scott Doyle in the javelin,
Frank Pittman in the 5,000
meters, Mark Pembroke at 800
meters, Angus McBryde at
1,500 meters, Derrick Freeman
at 400 meters, the mile relay
team of Mark Chapman, Chris
McGowan, Pembroke and
Freeman, and, in his first meet,
freshman Tom Murray in the
shot put.

“It just goes to show that if we
are to become a good team and
are going to win, we need a
team effort,’’ Aldridge said.

That feeling proved to be very
true as the Generals hosted both
Bridgewater and Eastern Men-
nonite in a tri-meet at W&L’s
Wilson Field on Tuesday.

It was Bridgewater’s first
meet of the season, and
although Coach Aldridge had no
knowledge of the Mennonite
squad, he still felt the two rivals
would provide a tough meet
with no team capable of running
away with the win. Coach
Aldridge was pleasantly sur-
prised, though, as the Generals
took eight of the 17 events, scor-
ing 91 points to Bridgewater’s 56
and EMC’s 32.

The difference was the
Generals’ depth and the team
effort they produced. The
Generals placed numerous
seconds and thirds along with a
sweep of the 1,500 meters, led
by Angus McBryde. W&L also
gained first-place finishes from
Townes Pressler in the high
jump, Paul Chapman in the 800
meters, Charlie Alcorn in the
discus, and John Carder in the
pole vault. Billy Rhinehart in
the triple jump and the mile
relay team of Chapman, Mc-
Gowan, Pembroke and Free-
man were the only members
that repeated victories in the
same events that they won at
Davidson.

The first three General vic-
tories were convincing enough
to put the ODAC title within
reach, although the team still
must face ODAC powerhouses
Lynchburg and Catholic. Both
of these schools will be tough,
especially Lynchburg, whom
the Generals just beat out for
the 1984 ODAC Indoor title.

Saturday, the Generals will
compete in the Liberty Baptist
Invitational.

to the video tape

the decision has set an un-
healthy precedent, that the TV
instant replay machine will
become the referee of the
future. I’m sorry (not really),
but first of all these guys are
overreacting. As Bill Millsaps
of the Richmond Times-Dis-
patch said, the decision by the
refs ‘‘made good sense.”’ The of-
ficials were in error, they
realized it (they are to be com-
mended for doing that), and TV
was the logical and only means
of correcting their mistake. So,
where’s the beef? We’ve got
television; but some mindless
rules committee demagogue
has placed an_ inexplicable
taboo on the use of instant
replays, even when using the
dreaded video tape would be the
common sense thing to do.
Frankly, after some of the of-
ficiating I’ve witnessed, the
replay would be a prayer well
answered. This is not to say ins-
tant replays should take the

place of an official, but it seems
fairly accurate to say that the
officials cannot see everything.
The cameras are an aid in a
situation like this, without a
doubt. Let’s take advantage of
what our technology has
brought us. It is not hocum to
say the only good game is a fair
game. It is plain and simple
blind stubbornness to ignore an
opportunity to make a game
fair...

....Turning to the colonnade,
In the Crease magazine has
come out with a prediction that
W&L lacrosse will drop to Divi-
sion III status in the near

thought. But as much as |

for the Generals to show us they
are competitive. If they ever
were, it has to be this week. |

- Lacrossers mired in 3-game skid

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

A couple of crucial situations
in two games over the week has
left the Washington and Lee
lacrosse team on the short end
of the stick, still searching for
its second victory of 1984.

Yesterday, the Generals were
handed a 14-4 defeat by Dela-
ware, dropping their season
mark to 1-3 after Saturday’s
18-7 loss at Maryland.

Wednesday’s contest turned
on a three-minute mandatory
penalty on the Generals’ Rich
Schoenberg. Daly said
Schoenberg dropped his gloves
— an automatic penalty — after
he was elbowed by a Delaware
player.

The Blue Hens scored three
times while Schoenberg sat out,
as they came back from a 2-0
early General lead to go in front
6-2 at the half.

“We came undone at that
point,” General head coach
Dennis Daly said. ‘I thought
things were moving pretty well
upto there.”

In College Park, Md., Satur-
day the Generals stayed even
with Maryland for nearly two
quarters, but a 12-3 second-half
Terp barrage gave W&L its se-
cond loss ina week.

“I felt that they controlled the
game rather than W&L con-
trolling the game. We didn’t
take control of the game
because we didn’t score when
we had early man-up oppor-
tunities, and that hurt us,’’ Daly
said.

“The disappointment was
that I felt good and I think the
team felt good going into the
game, but you come away and
Maryland was just the better
team’”’ Daly continued.

The Terps proved true their
reputation as an_ explosive
team, scoring four goals in a
two-and-a-half minute spurt
midway through the first
period.

Daly said Maryland gained
confidence as they started to
shoot, while the Generals’ lack
of success coupled with some
saves by Terp goalie Kevin
O'Leary had W&L_ shooters
hesitating before their shots.

W&L turned things around
with a score from sophomore
atackman Steve McGrath off an
excellent feed of junior Rod
Santomassimo at 14:21 of the
first quarter.

The Generals pulled within
one goal twice in period two,
getting a pair of scores from
Santomassimo and another
from attackman Lee Heimert.
Santomassimo’s goal at 10:22 of
the quarter put W&L in striking
distance at 5-4.

Then the roof caved in.

‘Their goals were big psycho-
logical advantage goals,’’ Daly
said, pointing to Terp goals 6, 7
and 8 as the turning points.

With 3:36 to go in the half, the
Terps’ Jean Steffen scored a
sixty-yard open-net goal to
make the score 6-4.

Then Maryland took quick ad-
vantage of a late first-half
holding penalty that left the
Generals in a mandown situa-
tion to start the second half.
Senior Jim Ellis scored with
just 16 seconds gone in the final
half.

The last straw came a
minute-and-a-half later when,
playing a man down, Maryland
middie Matt McGeady scooped
up a ground ball, raced down-
field on the fast break and dish-
ed to Jay Harkey for the short-
handed goal.

The Terps scored five un-
answered goals in the first 6:49
of the third quarter. Starting
goalie John DiDuro was then
replaced by Phil Aiken, who
was in turn replaced by
freshman John Church, as the
three faced 51 Maryland shots,
32 coming in the second half.

It was the second time in as
many outings that W&L faced a
hot goalie. The Terps’ Kevin
O’Leary made the best of his
surname on St. Patrick’s Day.
O’Leary faced the brunt of the
Generals’ attack in the first
quarter, at one point saving five
shots ina row.

Reinjuring a toe in quarter
two, O’Leary stepped out, and
teammate Kevin Bilger stood
between the pipes and turned
away four W&L attempts in the
remainder of the _ period.
O'Leary returned to finish the
second half.

The Terps’ other leaders in-
cluded Matt McGeady, who
assisted on six Maryland
scores, Jim Ellis and Steffen,

who combined for half the
team’s goals.

The Generals got fine efforts
from Santomassimo (two goals,
one assist), Lee Heimert (two
goals) and Sandy Brown (one

goal, one assist).

W&L looks to rebound out of
its slump Saturday at Wilson
Field as the team faces-off
against the Towson State Tigers
at2p.m.

“It’s just been a matter of a
group getting to know each
other. Unfortunately, it’s been
coming through losses and not
wins,’’ Daly explained.

The Tigers feature strong
performers inseniors Gavin
Moag in goal, and Mark Miller
on attack and junior midfielder
John Connolly.

The Generals’ are seeking
revenge from last season’s 12-8
Towson victory. W&L leads 13-7
in the series dating back to 1963.
The Generals have won 10 of the
last 12 meetings.

Netters knock off GWU

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee ten-
nis team scored a major upset
Sunday against Division I
George Washington University
by a score of 5-4 at the W&L ten-
nis courts.

The Generals (6-3) also pick-
ed up victories against Ran-
dolph-Macon, Averett and In-
diana University of Penn-
sylvania last week. The Gener-
als did lose a match, however,
at William & Mary.

“It was the biggest win of the
year so far,”’ said head tennis
coach Gary Franke of W&L’s
upset win over GWU. The No. 1
doubles team of Craig Cannon
and Roby Mize secured the vic-
tory with a win in the final
match of the day.

‘“‘We just played better than :

they did,” explained Franke.

Also on Sunday, W&L picked
up a win against IUP. Coach
Franke used younger varsity
players and several junior var-
sity players in the match, which
W&L won 6-3. Franke said his
purpose in using the mixed line-
up was to give some of his
younger players more ex-
perience in match play.

The Generals traveled to
Ashland on Monday to play
Randolph-Macon in an ODAC
match. W&L swept R-M 9-0 and
improved its ODAC record to
2-0. In that victory, the
Generals won five three-set
matches.

Tuesday, W&L defeated
Averett College by a score of
6-3. According to Franke, the
match with Averett was an

~w, Y Ye = Y wr ~~ Y sor 7 or Y = ~~ are

  
    
   
   
   
     
   

unexpected but helpful chal-
lenge with a lot of close mat-
ches.

The Generals received a
minor setback last Friday in an
8-1 loss at William & Mary.
Franke described the W&M pro-
gram as stronger than W&L’s.

Craig Cannon has established
an individual record of 6-1 at the
No. 1 singles position. His vic-
tories include impressive wins
against the No. 1 players for
Lehigh, William and Mary and
George Washington.

Franke agrees that Cannon is

playing exceptionally well and

believes that his success is the
result of a newly developed
mental toughness and individu-
al work on his groundstrokes.

The Generals played Rich- '

mond today at 3 p.m. and will
play Christopher Newport Fri-
day at 3 p.m., Salisbury State
Saturday at 10 a.m. and VMI
Tuesday at 3 p.m. All matches
will be played at the W&L ten-
nis courts.

Franke believes that this
week’s schedule will be ex-
tremely tough for the Generals.
“‘These are big matches for us if
we want to be considered for the
national tournament,’ he said.

Golfers 15th at JMU

By MIKE HASSINGER
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee golf
team finished 15th out of a field
of 24 squads in its first tourna-
ment of the 1984 season, the
James Madison University In-
vitational, last weekend. The
team title was captured by Divi-
sion I Maryland.

Coach Buck Leslie hopes for
improvement and said, ‘‘I’d
certainly like to see us finish in
the top half of a tournament at
least.” He cited first tourna-
ment jitters, lack of tournament
play and low concentration as
factors for the team’s sub-par
showing.

He does think that the match
was good experience for his un-
tried team and hopes that this
match was the starting point for
a team that will do well this
season. ‘‘We just need more
playing time,’’ said Leslie.

The experienced golfers, cap-
tains Whit Kelly and Bruce
Blythe, both gave the consistent
performances they were ex-
pected to give, finishing at 156

and 154 respectively. Their con-
sistent play is what Leslie has
been seeking from his team all
along.

Turner Friedman and Steve
Jones are expected to improve
their scores. Friedman shot 165
and Jones shot 168, scores
which Leslie said will be whittl-
ed down.

‘Bob Sloan played well. He
delivered a good overall perfor-
mance,’’ Coach Leslie said.

Although freshman Mike
Friedman, the younger of the
brothers, and Sloan played the
fifth and sixth positions, those
positions are only tentatively
filled. Had last week’s match
not been cancelled Leslie feels
that he would have a clearer
view of who would be playing
those slots. The added ex-
perience would have given a
more definitive view of a team
whose needs remain to be seen.

Today’s play will match W&L
against Bluefield in a home
match at the Lexington Country
Club. Coach Leslie expects good
things from his team for today’s
effort.

Baseball falls to BC, 11-4

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
baseball team dropped two of
three ODAC home games last
week.

The generals split a double-
header with Emory and Henry
on Saturday and lost to
Bridgewater Tuesday after-
noon.

In the first game against
Emory and Henry, W&L right-
hander Bill White turned in a
- stellar performance, allowing
only two hits and one earned
run in the Generals’ 7-2 victory.

Freshman third baseman
Milam Turner provided most of
the Generals’ firepower with
four RBIs and two hits.

In the nightcap, the Generals’
bats went cold in crucial situa-
tions as Emory and Henry won
6-0.

Emory and Henry pushed five
runs across the plate in the
third inning against starting
pitcher Kirk Breen.

Freshman lefthander Bill

Schoettelkotte pitched five
scoreless innings in relief of
Breen, allowing only two hits.

“We found our strengths and
weaknesses all in one day,”
said W&L head coach Jim Mur-
dock. ‘In the first game, we
played with poise and con-
fidence and did everything
right. We hit, fielded, pitched
the way it is supposed to be
done.”’

“In the second game, it seem-
ed a different team took the
field. We didn’t hit well and our
pitching let us down,” Murdock
said.

On Tuesday W&L spotted
Bridgewater a five-run lead in
the first inning and never
recovered, losing 11-4.

Bridgewater added two runs
in the third inning to extend its
lead to7-0.

W&L answered by scoring
three runs in the bottom of the
third, as White had a two-run
double and shortstop Dave War-
renfeltz a one-run single. The
Generals could have reduced
the Eagles’ lead even more but

 

failed to get a hit with the bases
loaded and two outs.

The Generals scored their
last run in the fourth inning,
cutting Bridgewater’s lead to
7-4. Once again, W&L was only
one hit away from a big inning
as two men were left stranded

.on base.

Bridgewater added two runs
in the fifth inning and single
runs in the sixth and eighth in-
nings to put the game out of
reach at 11-4.

Freshman lefthander Randy
Brown settled after his shaky
first inning and pitched well
during the next innings before
being relieved by sophomore
Peter Detlefs in the ninth.

Lefthander Greg Rexrode got
the win for Bridgewater, whose
record now stands at 3-2-1.

W&L fell to 4-5 (1-2 in ODAC
play) with the loss.

The Generals face ODAC foe
Lynchburg Thursday in Lynch-
burg at 3 p.m. The team returns
to Lexington to host Randolph-
Macon in a doubleheader begin-
ning at 1:30 p.m. Saturday at
Smith Field.

all asked, did Delaware and
New Jersey work 20 hours a day
churning out unnatural fibers?
The answer, as we found out
upon arriving in Princeton, is
supply-and-demand. Polyester
blazers in earthy colors seem to
be in at Northern state schools.
Indeed, even the Princetonians
we met wore grubby, un-
WASPy looking outfits. Tsk,
tsk.

To give you an idea of the
situation: as ‘host nation,’ we
expected to be full participants
in the dizzying social round. So
we packed black tie for the
receptions. Well. AC-DC_ T-
shirts were de riguer at the big
functions. Why, some coarse
young woman snarled, were we
so snazzed up (her words)? We
politely explained that since the
program had not specified at-
tire, we naturally assumed that
black tie was required. We were
also asked what the funny black
buttons on our shirt fronts
were; and one girl told Gerald
Shepherd that she’d never even
dreamt of black tassel loafers
before. I believe she was one of
the Michigan State crowd.

That was the same night
Bradford Stengel and I nearly
had to defend the Stars and
Bars with our fists. There were
actually people who objected to
our posting it at our table at the
reception. They must have been

fuming when, later in the eve-
ning, the Virginia schools got
together, gathered ‘round the
flag, and sang ‘Dixie’ and “The
Bonnie Blue Flag.’ One final
note on the reception. They
simply do not play beach music
up North. Atall.

From this experience, I have
drawn the following morals,
which I now pass on to you all. I
think they may come in handy.

FIRST: Don’t go North if you
can help it.

SECOND: Stock up on bour-
bon and cigars before you cross
the Line. I recommend Dixie li-
quors in D.C.

THIRD: Stay away from girls
from Muehlenburg College.
Miss Argentina all but persuad-
ed me to restructure the inter-
national debt structure in her
favor.

FOURTH: Always carry a
flask. It is precisely that sort of
preparedness that got us an in-
vite to Nationals. Their
observer likes bourbon.

FIFTH. Always stay at the
Hyatt, especially if the school is
paying.

This year, only Hollins, Miss
Argentina, and us-all stayed
there.

Boy, life is rough.

With these recommendations

' borne in mind, even in the wilds

of New Joisey, you will be able
to survive with flair, in the best
traditions of W&L. Cheers.

SAB

(continued from page 4)

the social life at Washington
and Lee could be improved,”’ he
said. ‘‘We hope to provide more
regularly-scheduled events.’’

Smith said the chairman
would “‘have the ultimate say,”’
while the executive director
would ‘‘do more of _ the
legwork.”

‘“‘There’s a certain amount of
structure for the directors,’’ he
explained, ‘‘but the other two
need to have a little bit of
latitude.”

He said the chairman would
have the broadest authority and

. would stay in close touch with

the executive director, who in
turn would work on a day-to-day
basis with the seven directors.

“There has to be someone
with ultimate responsibility,’
Haywood said. ‘“Co-chairmen
don’t work. We’ve tried it.”’

“You may get a situation
where you have two equally
qualified people,’ Smith said.
“‘T still wouldn’t make them co-
chairmen.”’

Haywood said he felt the EC
should continue to appoint the
SAB leadership. ‘‘We are their
subcommittee,”’ he said. ‘‘They
should appoint our officers and
members.”

He said he would favor an
election subcommittee of the
EC similar to this year’s
finance committee to review
candidates for SAB positions.

Smith said that ‘‘ideally’’ the
previous year’s chairman
would have some input into the
selection of his successor. He
would then like to see a ‘“‘time
lag’ during which the new
chairman is consulted on the
selection of the executive direc-
tor and director posts.

He said the new structure
would be weakened if people
were appointed for ‘“‘political
reasons,’’ which both he and
Haywood say has been done in

the past.

“It upsets me when someone
gets appointed because he’s a
good guy,”’ Smith said. ‘‘A lot of
times a person can be better
qualified because he doesn’t fit
the mold of everyone else.”’

“By and large, most of the EC
doesn’t know what happens in
the SAB,”’ he continued.

“I would like to see the EC
display a little faith in the
Board. I understand their posi-
tion and responsibility, but they

can’t possibly know all the de-

tails and aspects of our pro-
posal. A

“It’s not as if we decided on it
out of the blue. All we want is to
do the best job we can and rem-
edy some of the problems that
we can see.”

Haywood sounded a similar
note. ‘‘Most of the people on the
EC don’t understand how we
operate,” he said. ‘‘We have the
job of explaining to them what
it’s like now, what’s wrong with
it, and what we want changed.”

‘I see Monday’s action by the
EC as a commitment to the SAB
that they recognize that a struc-
tural change is necessary,’’ he
said.

‘A lot of details still need to
be settled,” he added. ‘‘We’re in
no hurry. We’ll take the time to
work it out.”

Haywood said that while he is
“the strongest advocate on
campus of providing a high
quality of social life for in-
dependents,’’ he would ‘‘ab-
solutely not”’ favor a director in
charge of independent affairs.

‘‘We’re concerned with pro-
viding social activities for the
entire university,” he said.
“We're not going to bend the
organization out of shape for
special interests.”

He said he had the same
response when SABU requested
SAB funds last year.

“There comes a point where

the allocation of funds is
disproportionate to the number
of people involved,’ he con-
tinued.

“IT agree that independents
have some special needs, such
as the scheduling of IM teams.
There’s room for that in the
SAB if it’s needed. But I think in
the long run, the independents
will come out better if we con-
centrate our efforts on the stu-
dent body as a whole.”’

Haywood said that a similar
restructuring was proposed a
year ago, and that he and Smith
have been refining it all year.

He said they were ‘“‘the two
most interested,” the only two
junior officers, and the juniors
with the most seniority on the
Board.

Smith said that the proposal
was ‘‘a culmination of a lot of
discussion” and that both of
them agreed on the needed
changes. _

Calendar-——

55-minute classes, but noted
that proposal did receive twice
as much support as any of the
other changes.

One reason cited by Feldman
for the large number of students
voting in favor of keeping all
aspects of the calendar and
registration the same was the
fact that the status quo choices
were all listed on the left side of
the ballot, and all the changes
were on the right side. Thus a
student could circle the four
proposals on the left side
without really studying the
alternatives, Feldman said.

Feldman said he was pleased
with the turnout for the poll,
conducted in conjunction with
class elections. Feldman added
that turnout would have been
even higher if seniors had had
class officer elections.

that students register for all of

The committee voted ‘‘to

$15,000 Contact fund shortage goes unnoticed

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

Contact, the student organization that
brings speakers to campus, has a section
on its budget reports titled ‘‘funds dispers-
ed,’’ which is perhaps more appropriate
than the term that is presumably meant,
‘funds disbursed.”’

University records show the organiza-
tion ran a deficit of nearly $10,000 last
year, at the same time that Contact’s own
accounting showed a $950 surplus for the
year.

That deficit, added to the nearly $6,000
negative balance that the University show-
ed Contact began last year with, put this
year’s organization more than $15,000 in
the red before the year even started.

,pparently no University or Contact of

ials were aware of the shortfall until last

hen Contact co-chairmen Marty

ttamn

withdraw non-existent funds from the
group’s University account.

‘They have come up short,” University
Treasurer E. Stewart Epley said.

‘I don’t know what the explanation is.”’
Founded in 1965, Contact is funded by stu-
dent body taxes, by the Interfraternity
Council and by individual contributions.
The IFC has appropriated $7,500 for the
organization for the last two years. In ad-
dition, the EC contributed $8,500 in student
taxes last year and $9,400 this year.

The final budget report prepared by Con-
tact 83 (as the 1982-83 group was known)
showed that it spent $19,996.54 while taking
in $20,958.38, putting the organization
$961.84 in the black. According to Universi-
ty accounting, however, Contact °83
started the year with a deficit balance of
$5,789.71 which had been carried forward
from bese previous vear’s $ organization

no the ney me 31} ng \ veal

expenditures of $25,592.40 on revenues of
$16,075, a difference of $9,517.40.

“This was a very expensive year,’’ said
assistant University treasurer Vernon
Snyder, who handles student body ac-
counts.

Therefore, although Harmon and Slahor
did not realize it until late February, ac-
cording to University books the $16,900 in
funding they began the year with was
credited against a deficit balance of
$15,307.11, leaving them only $1,592.89 in
effective operating funds.

According to its Dec. 6 budget report to
the EC, the group spent close to that
amount just on the solicitation letter which
was sent to parents last fall

The deficit, had anyone noticed it, looked
smaller on paper than it actually was,

ecause the $7,500 IFC appropriation in-

i¢
i

deposited in April and credited to Contact
83.

Outgoing IFC President on Ellinger
explained that the organization does its
budgeting and appropriation in the winter,
just before the new officers begin their
terms.

‘‘We’ve just given Contact the money
and haven't watched over it,”’ Ellinger
said.

Because they have differing categories
for disbursements, line-by-line com-
parison of University and Contact reports
is impossible.

In addition, Contact maintains a check-
ing account of its own at United Virginia
Bank. Transactions involving that account
are reflected in reports prepared by the
student organization, but do not appear on

Review and Outlook
Priorities

This week in the Executive Committee meeting
minutes, in a slot always used to list its absent
members, the committee complimented us by mark-
ing us absent as though we were a member.

We cannot sufficiently express our gratitude.

In addition, a rumor has been quickly spread that
we are “boycotting” its meetings out of some
unknown reason, a perception that seems to have
been born and bred in the EC’s office.

These occurrences create in us a feeling of ap-
prehension. In a year of over 25 meetings so far, The
Ring-tum Phi has missed one, an attendance record
better than some of the committee’s own members.

As we are not required to attend each of its gather-
ings or include EC news in our weekly coverage, the
EC’s action strikes us as a bit presumptuous.

The Ring-tum Phi cannot cover all the news that
takes place every week. We must then make judg-
ments as to what we will include in our pages. The EC
is no exception in our decision-making process.
Nothing can receive automatic coverage.

As the authority over almost all of the student
_organizations on campus, the Executive Committee
plays a large part in the news picture of the W&L
campus. Indeed it is often rightfully the subject of
lead and front-page stories. When it takes notable ac-
tion, it is our job to report it and we are at fault when
we do not.

One might argue that the Phi must cover every mo-
tion, vote and budget report so that concerned stu-
dents can then participate in their student govern-
ment. For such complete detail, the EC produces ex-
tensive minutes after every meeting and posts them
on campus bulletin boards.

We hope then that the EC members realize that
they are competing with such demanding issues as
coeducation, the Mock Convention and the special
grand jury as well as other important stories that ap-
pear each week, and that they will show a little bit
more understanding of news judgment in the future.

Students discuss SNu incident

White replies

To the Editors:

I would like to clarify some of
the misconceptions about my
involvement in the SNu inci-
dent. Please refer to last week’s
article, “SNu Decides to Drop
Issue,”’ for details of the facts.

First of all, my involvement
was minor in that I only
possessed the simulator.

Second, this gadget was sold
at a public exhibition as a novel-
ty item. Since it was sold to the
public, the question of its legali-
ty never entered my mind. In
retrospect, I should not have
had it in my possession, nor
should I have given it to anyone
else. I made a mistake, and I
am paying a stiff penalty for it.

Regarding the opinions ex-
pressed in last week’s Phi, I
hope the student body will not
consider a minor involverhent
in a childish prank to be worthy
of resignation. I would like to
think the students recognize the
positive contributions I have

made to this year’s Committee
and my continuing determina-
tion to represent the students
well.

If any ambiguities remain, I
earnestly hope the students will
contact me personally.

To the Editors:

Although we do not condone
the possession of an artillery
simulator, we remind the stu-
dents that James White has con-
tributed effectively and

’ representatively to the Ex-

ecutive Committee this year.
Requests that he resign seem
ill-founded and inappropriate.
We encourage James to dismiss
such requests and rededicate
himself to another year of quali-
ty service.

Pyle’s view of North

To the Editors:

Mr. Pyle’s column in the
March 22 issue was undoubtedly
most offensive to the many
students here from Northern
states. I am sure that many of
them will take the opportunity
to reply to his hardly flattering
remarks about their homeland.

As a Westerner, I am not par-
ticularly concerned with the
relative merits of the North and
South. My concern, (and this
concern should be foremost
among the student body) is
that, judging from Mr. Pyle’s
own description of the event,
Washington and Lee was hor-

WLUR seeks

To the Editors:

When one ascends the heights
of Reid Hall to the WLUR
studios, one is assaulted by
signs reminding him that the
honor code applies fully to the
third floor and that it is an
honor violation to remove
records or equipment without
proper authorization.

By the end of last year and
through the Fall Term this
year, I thought that we had
finally driven this point home
and that the problem of records
‘walking away” had been sup-
planted by an awareness of the
honor code and what it entails.

After an exhaustive search, it
has been determined that at
least four albums are recently
missing from the WLUR record
library. These include the Foot-
loose soundtrack, 99 Luftballons
by Nena, Making Movies by
Dire Straits and Pictures at 11
by Robert Plant. Legally these
records are the property of the
record companies, not WLUR.
The radio station is responsible
for them while they are in our

ribly misrepresented at the
Model United Nations at
Princeton. It appears that, at
the very least, the delegation
sent by our University showed a
significant lack of tact. As an
example, the members of the
delegations should have recog-
nized that immaturely display-
ing the Confederate banner is
bound to elicit very negative
feelings among large segments
of the American population,
many of whom were assuredly
represented at Princeton that
weekend. I fear that
Washington and Lee has been
unfairly shown as a bastion of

lost albums

custody.

We do not know why these
albums are AWOL. We do not
know if someone on our staff
may be responsible, or if it may
be someone else. We would hate
to think that they have been
stolen on a campus which
prides itself on a tradition of
honorable conduct.

“We do not think it is too
much to ask for a student to ...
claim only that which is his.”
(Washington and Lee Universi-
ty White Book, page 1.)

Regardless of the circum-
stances surrounding the disap-
pearance, these records are
missing, of that we are sure.

If anyone has a copy of one of
these albums_ stamped
‘‘WLUR,”’ we appeal to this per-
son’s sense of honor to them-
selves and this community and
ask that the records be returned
in any manner the person
chooses, with no questions ask-
ed. Thank you.

comments

To the Editors:

I definitely think it is about
time that the incident between
Phi Delt and Sigma Nu a few
weeks back was laid to rest, but
first someone needs to respond
on behalf of Phi Delt.

Mr. St. Clair and Mr. Steil-
berg both referred to the inci-
dent in last week’s Phi as the
BOMBING of the Sigma Nu
house by members of Phi Delt.
I, personally, was under the im-
pression that the Iraqi’s were
bombing the Iranians and that
the Shiite Moslems were bomb-
ing Beirut. For some reason I
just don’t see one fraternity
bombing another. Notice, the
newly painted columns at 4
Henry St. are still standing; the
masonry still stands as a fairly
imposing structure; even the
dead hedges lining the yard still
surround the fortress. 0.K., I

In partial response to Mr.

EC backs SAB restructuring

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

An improved ability to offer
social activities will be the main
result of the Executive Commit-
tee’s recent approval of a plan
to decentralize the Student Ac-
tivities Board, according to the
two SAB officers who proposed
the change.

Vice-chairman Burford Smith
and treasurer John Haywood
said they welcome the EC’s
Monday night decision, which
will give next year’s SAB a
board of directors structure.

“I’m glad that the EC took the
action that they did,” said
Smith. “They saw that it was in
the best interests of the Student
Body to meet the problems
we've been having.” |

Under the reorganization
plan the SAB will be headed by
a chairman who will be assisted
by an executive director, a

Calendar proposal

should have that one day
(Thanksgiving Day) off. The
possibility was mentioned of
having that day off and making
up classes on the Saturday.”’

Although each of these pro-
posals was discussed, Wise
said, none was voted on.

Wise said members of the
committee cited two main
reasons for rejecting the two-
day vacation in October and the
three-day vacation over
Thanksgiving. ‘‘A partial break
very soon deteriorates into
students’ going (home) earlier
and coming back later that
eventually will extend (each
shorter break) to a week,” he
added.

Feldman, who was not at Fri-
day’s meeting but voted by pro-
xy, said he was disappointed
with the committee’s decision
to substitute the one-week Oc-

treasurer and a secretary. One
member of a newly formed
Board of Directors will be
assigned to coordinate work in
each of the six areas of SAB ac-
tivity. These areas are enter-
tainment/bands, entertain-
ment/weekends, outing/recrea-
tion, films/special events,
publicity and operations.

“T think that the Student Body
is going to be surprised next
year by the number of activities
we can offer,’ Haywood re-
marked.

Haywood said that under the
present SAB structure the
group did not have enough peo-
ple to concentrate on certain
areas such as outings. The addi-
tional people will enable the
SAB to try new things and con-
centrate on areas that previous-
ly had been neglected, he add-
ed.

“We're pretty good at what
we do now,” said Smith, ‘‘but
we're limited in the things we

can try,’’ said Haywood
finishing the sentence.

Smith added that he hoped the
EC would appoint a subcom-
mittee to go over the SAB ap-
plications in the spring and
would consult with former SAB
members before making selec-
tions. Many new EC members
are not aware of the workings of
the SAB, he said.

“If competent people are ap-
pointed to the different posi-
tions, then any needs that the
Student Body has will be ac-
comodated. If the people ap-
pointed don’t work, then you
will have three or four people
doing all the work just like
now,” Smith said.

New officers for the SAB will
be appointed in the spring by
the EC. Freshmen, first-year
law students and anyone who
had a legitimate reason for not
applying in the spring can still
be appointed next fall, Smith
said.

tober vacation for the
Thanksgiving vacation.

“The mindset in the faculty
was that students would be tak-
ing two weeks off,” he said. ‘I
felt that could be greatly reduc-
ed if the professors assigned
work when (the students) were
supposed to be there.”’ The com-
mittee will report to President
Wilson within the next two
weeks, Wise said. Wilson can
then decide whether to pass the
report on to the whole faculty
for its approval. Faculty ap-
proval — which would be re-
quired for any changes to be
made — would follow action by
one or more standing faculty
committees and the University
Council.

An appendix to the commit-
tee’s report, Wise said, is

another proposal under which
the calendar would be split into
six-week segments, enabling

Cappeto says stress
over jobs increasing

By STEVE POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

Despite increased graduate
school openings and the best job
market in recent years, Associ-
ate Dean of Students Michael A.
Cappeto has noticed a sharp in-
crease in student anxiety about
what to do next year.

‘What I’ve noticed in talking
almost exclusively with seniors
is an awful lot of stress, much
more than in the past,” said
Cappeto, who has observed this
stress among underclassmen as
well. “I really don’t know why,”’
he said.

According to Cappeto, the
current job market is better
than it has been in the past five
or six years. Prospective em-
ployers who visit W&L are hir-
ing more people than they have
in the past. National reports in-
dicate more openings in
graduate schools and better
employment opportunities. The
economy has improved, and
unemployment is down.

“Graduate school is easier to
get into,’’ said Cappeto,
because fewer people are apply-
ing. He noted a high demand for
teachers, chemists and a host of
other professional people.

The situation is still very
stressful, however, ‘‘The
seniors have pretty much nar-
rowed down what they want to
do. You have to be _ thick-
skinned to enter the job market.
Its the same thing with
graduate school.”

Dean of Students Lewis John
has not noticed more students
coming to his office for counsel-
ing, but has observed a change
in why they are coming.

“I think there is more con-
cern among seniors about what
they will do next year,’’ said
John.

Neither University Chaplain
David Sprunt Sr. nor University
Psychologist James Worth has
noticed any change in the
number of students or their pro-
blems.

“I believe he (Cappeto) is
seeing more stress. At the same
time...I can’t say I’m seeing
students coming in with more

stress,”’ said Worth.

Both Worth and Cappeto feel,
however, that there is a mis-
perception about’ the
psychologist’s role as a
counselor.

“It’s simply a matter of label-
ing,’ said Cappeto. ‘Dr. Worth
is...labeled the psychologist.”

“The overwhelming majority
of things I talk about with
students are issues I faced when
I went to school,’ said Worth,
who sees about 130 students dur-
ing the course of the school
year.

Worth does believe the anxie-
ty in students noted by Cappeto
is real, and both he and Cappeto
have speculated about reasons
for this stress.

“‘T think it’s too early to say
there is a trend,’’ said Worth,
who feels the added stress may
be a reaction to change at W&L
or to past years’ economics.

“‘We’re in a period of reas-
sessment,”’ according to Worth.

Cappeto agreed, ‘‘Things are
moving and changing. Many un-
derclassmen are anxious about
that.’’

According to Cappeto and
Worth, the University does offer
a variety of services to students
who feel anxiety about the
future. ‘‘We offer more [place-
ment] services than 80 percent
of the schools our size,” said
Cappeto. ‘‘Seniors receive peri-
odical literature from me.”

‘‘Mike and I each have some-
thing to offer,” said Worth, who
wishes more students would
make appointments to see him
whenever they feel anxious or
depressed.

Cappeto is especially desirous
of seeing the perceived tension
lessened.

‘“‘Everyone’s so uptight about
what they’re going to do next
year. I would like to say,
‘Relax. Your senior year is sup-
posed to be a year to
remember,’ ”’ he said.

‘I’ve had two or three people
sit down in my office and cry,”
said Cappeto. ‘“‘Everywhere I
walk I see people who are very,
very concerned about next
year. I’ve never seen that
before.”’

come on, I once saw my own
mother break a pane of glass,
but, of course, that too was just
an accident, as was the break-
ing of Sigma Nu’s windows.
Capt. Ripple of the military
science department has de-
scribed this so-called bomb (ac-
tually an artillery simulator) as
a “large firecracker,’ and
James White has said that he
was unaware that the device
was dangerous. So, when Frank
Surface chunked the
‘firecracker’ into Sigma Nu’s
front yard it was hardly in an
attempt to BOMB our poor
neighbors. As a matter of fact,
it sounded like a fairly harmless
joke when I first heard about it.
Therefore, all of the members
of Phi Delt were very amazed
that the members of Sigma Nu
became so upset about the
whole affair. In order to ap-
pease them, we have stolidly
accepted our two weeks proba-
tion and $150 fine for our con-
nection with the firecracker.

Surface and White have made

Well first of all, try criminal

pretentious to condemn an en-

on your warped “Southern”
beliefs. Everyone from the

like to believe, wear polyester

chemical plant. In fact, after
living in New Jersey for my en-

been quite pleasant.

I come from a small city not
very unlike Lexington, except
in that there are no Nazi-like
“special grand juries’’ running
around handing out subpoenas
to people who they think might

fewer people who are as confor-

Mr. Pyle, and this may, in part,
account for the fact that
everyone in Northern schools
does not dress exactly alike.

In closing, I would like to add
that although I cannot account

reason the view is so ugly is to

To the Editors:

In regard to Markham Shaw
Pyle’s recent report about his
adventures with the model
United Nations meeting, or
more appropriately his very
negative view of the environ-
ment in which it was held, I felt
the letter to be very detrimental

to the relations between North-

erners and Southerners at

W&L. This school prides itself _

on the harmonious relationship
between North and South, and
for a school that derives a large

percentage of its students from
the North, it cannot afford for
such a relationship to be
damaged. The letter Mr. Pyle
wrote only serves to underscore
his obvious old fashioned, close-
minded attitude, an attitude
that does not belong at a univer-
sity such as Washington and
Lee. One must feel regret that
Mr. Pyle felt he had to impose
his negative opinion at the ex-
pense of many fine students
from the Northern states. Most
students here have the sense to
recognize bad taste, all except
Lord Pyle.

As to Mr. Pyle’s thoughts
about fashion, he himself is no
candidate for G.Q. One must
bear in mind that his comments
may be out of embarrassment
at his faux-pas more than
anything else. Since Mr. Pyle
had not been north before, I feel
he is an unqualified candidate
to make such rash judgments
about the area.

In closing, may I point out
that while New Jersey and
Delaware produce more chemi-
cals than any other states,
without which this country
could not survive, they also
possess many natural regions of
beauty, something that Mr.
Pyle chose to ignore in his opi-
nionated evaluation. In the
future, I hope that Mr. Pyle will
keep his foot out of his mouth
and think before he speaks. His
letter brings to mind the old
adage ‘People in glass houses
shouldn’t throw stones.’

Long John’s comes up short

By EDDIE CURRAN
Staff Reporter
Before reviewing Long John
Silver’s Seafood Shoppe, I
would like to clear my con-
science with an admission of
selfishness. What with a load of
term papers and exams in the
near future, and with professors

Eat Beat

ATALANTA I A TITERS TR
stubbornly continuing in their
underestimation of my academ-
ic performances (that’s what
you get for being too deep), I’ve
been a little frustrated of late.
So instead of attempting to il-
luminate some gem of a
restaraunt, as should be my
aim, I’ve opted out of spite to be
the one to hand out a bad grade.
Nevertheless, I believe. that
what follows is a fair review of
Long John Silver’s, and as com-
prehensive as one trip with one
stomach could be.

To get to Long John’s, get on
State Highway 60 heading out of
town, pass Wendy’s on your
right and KFC on your left
(‘‘Why did I keep going?”’), and
it’s to the right just after the
underpass.

One of my favorite things
about Long John’s is the en-
trance walkway, which re-
sembles a wharf (referred to by
northerners as a pier, or a

dock), with a thick ship-rope

railing. This reminds me of
home, but without the water.
Inside, Long John’s has the
national chain look; you order
at a counter, it’s clean; it’s
comfortable, the employees
wear uniforms, etc. On the wall
before you get to the counter

‘are pictures of the Long John

meals, and I imagine that it is
this visual effect which has a lot
to do with whatever degree of
success Long John Silver’s en-
joys. The pictures, like the food,

look. enticing. Seafood
—‘check’’ — crunchy-looking
—‘‘check’” — golden —
‘check’.

Last year, I went to Long
John’s several times, always
because the thought of crunchy,
golden-fried seafood overcame
that part of me which should
have remembered and known
better. Like any wise Pavlov
dog, I’ve learned.

But in the name of duty I
returned and ordered the
seafood platter, the clam din-
ner, an oyster, and a chicken
piece, so as to avoid missing a
possible house specialty. The
waitress who brought the meal
asked me if I always ate like
this.

That I was alive and relative-
ly zit free should’ve answered

the question, but I told her I’d

missed lunch.

With the seafood platter, you
get a piece of fish, two scallops,
a couple of shrimp, french fries,

hush puppies, cole slaw and a

    

bed of krumblies.

Easily the nastiest thing on
the plate is the fried fish;
though the fish itself might be of
good quality, it’s always better
to know what kind of fish you’re
eating. Seeing only ‘‘fried fish”’
as the description should make
you as suspicious as ‘‘fried
meat.’’ But what makes this
fish inexcusable is the fried
outer layer. The batter forms a
bright, crunchy glaze around
the fish, somehow keeping the
grease on the inside. After a bit,
you see that it glistens with
grease, makes the fish sticky,
and is so rich that it over-
whelms the fish. The flavor,
while unique, is ultimately just
Long-John-Slivery.

The scallops, as they are
cooked like the fish, taste very
much like the fish, equally
greasy.

The shrimp, though cooked
the same, are not as affected as
the fish and scallops, because
shrimp doesn’t soak grease like
fish and scallops. But the
shrimp is not real good either,
with the naked shrimp being

much smaller before it’s cooked -

than after.

The best thing on the plate is
the cole slaw. Though it’s basic
generic fast food cole slaw, it
sits out like a clean, fresh oasis
of nutrition on the plate. The
hush puppies and french fries
are filling at best.

The clam dinner, however,
was far better than the other
seafood. The clams come to the
store already breaded, in a dif-
ferent batter, so they’re spared
the Long John method. They’re
not at all greasy, the batter is
flaky, and the clams _ them-
selves are good and chewy. I ate
all the clams, which is more
than I can say for the platter.

The chicken piece wasn’t
greasy, but there was more
bread than chicken. If chicken’s

Kudos to the management at
the State theatre for having the
far-sightedness to schedule
Blame It On Rio during the
finals week. This hedonistic (as
well as chauvinistic) romp in
the sand is a sure cure for
whatever ails you during these

days of intellectual overachiev-
ment. The medicinal list of in-
gredients includes more T&A,
flesh, skin, etc. than should be
allowed to be screened in a town
supporting two all-male col-
leges, and a fantasy of a
screenplay that will delight
even the most grievous class-
room burnout victims.

 

Blame It On Rio is reminis-
cent of the old surf’s-up movies
of the early 60s with an 80s tem-
po and a big enough budget to
elevate it above the status of a B
movie. The selling point of this
movie, however, is not the plot
line, as is apparent five minutes
into the first reel. The star at-
tractions are the opulent
beaches of Rio de Janeiro (and
more importantly the wall-to-
wall nudity) and the bodacious
debut of actress Michelle
Johnson, whose “tubular per-

 

Rio raunchy fun

formance’’ will not soon be
forgotten (although I can’t
remember a word she said).

Michael Caine is superb as a
middle-aged man in mid-crisis.
Joseph Bologna is very convinc-
ing as Caine’s cohort and future
cardiac arrest candidate.
General Hospital’s Demi Moore
is attractive as Michelle’s
playmate and Valerie Harper
plays the role of a typical wife
who’s gone through one too
many sessions of hot-tub
psychotherapy.

The first hour and fifteen
minutes is a veritable highlight
film of Miss Johnson and a host
of other nubile young things.
Unfortunately the ending gets
bogged down in several amoral
plot twists that left me begging
for one more glimpse of Miss
Johnson’s anatomy, but to no
avail. It was an obvious plot
designed to necessitate multiple
viewings.

My strategy for the W&L
moviegoer reads as follows:
Schedule your exams on alter-
nating days starting Saturday.
Go see Blame It On Rio after
every exam. I guarantee that
for the hour and a half that you
are ensconced in the theater
you will be oblivious to the fact
that you just flagged your
Macro-economics final and
won’t graduate in May.

P.S. Eddie Curran’s contribu-
tions to this review were greatly
appreciated.

 

 

what you want, see volumes I &
II of The Beat.

I’m not a fan of fried oysters,
but I’ve enjoyed them more
than I enjoyed this one. It was
greasy, and after a bite it fell
out of its bread sac.

The most obnoxious part of
the Long John’s experience is
the bed of what they call
krumblies, upon which all the
seafood sits. They’re little crun-
chy pieces of fried batter and
are nothing but cholesterol
grease balls, with no pretense of
nutritional value. They are a fit-
ting symbol to the Long John’s
outlook: If it’s golden and crun-
chy, somebody out there will
eat it.

Usually I have this pride

thing about finishing everything
on my plate, but swallowed
pride doesn’t threaten to haunt
you later like Long John’s fish,
so the fish stayed behind, and I
went to take a shower.

For another side of the story,
here’s what fellow chow hound
Charlie Alcorn has to say: “‘I’ll
stick my neck out for Long John
Silver’s. I feel that the cuisine
there is of a quality that defies
description.’’ Maybe so, _ if
you’re hard up for seafood and
have an iron belly. But be warn-
ed, after you eat that fish, you
might end up running out of
there.

joys cakes, cookies, doughnuts

Baseball drops three
ODAC contests

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
baseball team’s hopes of win-
ning the ODAC title were dealt a
severe blow last week as the
Generals lost three conference
games.

W&L saw its record fall to 4-8
(1-5 in the ODAC). The Gen-
erals lost to Lynchburg 5-4
Thursday and dropped a
doubleheader with Randolph-
Macon, 4-3 and 7-4, at home on
Saturday.

Against Lynchburg, the
Generals never led. Trailing 5-2
entering the ninth inning, W&L
scored two runs in the inning
but was unable to tie the game
as a man was left stranded on
third at the end of the game.

W&L head coach Jim Mur-
dock said that his team ‘‘played
very well against Lynchburg
but had a couple of defensive
lapses that coust us the game.”

spotted Randolph-Macon an
early lead in both games of the
doubleheader and was unable to
make up the lost ground.

In the first game, R-MC
scored three runs in the first in-
ning against W&L starter Kirk
Breen.

The Generals battled back
and trailed 4-3 in the seventh in-
ning. The failure to produce the
crucial hit hurt W&L again as
the game ended with a General
runner on third base. Breen
(1-3) got the loss for the
Generals.

In the second game, the
Generals fell apart early in the
game as the Yellow Jackets
tagged freshman Jon Thornton
for four runs in the second in-
ning.

“We seem to put our game
together in one area, only to
have another area fall apart,”’
said Murdock. ‘When we hit’
our pitching lets us down, and
vice versa. The big innings
where we let our opponents
score three runs against us
also.”

“But we are not mentally
defeated,”’ Murdock added.
“Our attitude is still good and
we can still make a run for the
conference title.”’

Lax dumps Guilford

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

What a difference an after-
noon makes.

Washington and Lee head
lacrosse coach, who was
desperately looking for the little
things to start going his team’s
way, found relief with an im-
pressive 17-7 win over Guilford
yesterday afternoon in the mud
at Glen Maury Park, snapping a
four-game skid.

“They just went out there and
said, ‘Let’s doit,’ and they did. I
was really pleased. It’s a very
nice feeling,’’ Daly said.

The Generals, for the first
time since their opening win
against Virginia Tech, got an
early jump on their opponents,
racing to a 4-0 first quarter lead
from which they never looked
back.

W&L took a 7-4 lead at‘ the
half, and after the Quakers’
Tim Diamond scored with 5:23
gone in the third quarter, the
Generals got a pair of goals
from junior attack Rod San-

tomassimo and a third from
sophomore midfielder Steve
McGrath to end the quarter
with a 10-5 lead.

The Generals added seven
tallies in the final stanza, get-
ting two from sophomore G. T.
Corrigan and two from scoring
leader Lee Heimert, who had

five goals on the afternoon.

Reversing another pattern,
the dominant goaltender in this
game was in the Generals’ net
in the person of junior John
DiDuro. DiDuro turned away 17
shots, including an early first-
quarter Guilford breakaway at-
tempt that Daly saw as the
‘whole ball game.”’

“It made them think that we

. had Plexiglas in front of the net.

He was just great today,’’ Daly
said, emphasizing — that
DiDuro‘s early saves gave the

‘Generals the momentum that

carried them to the victory.

The Generals got fine offen-
sive performances from San-
tomassimo with four goals, one
assist and junior Jeff Mason
with three goals, one assist.

The Generals controlled the
game statistically, as_ well.
Senior Rich Schoenberg con-
tinued his dominance of the
faceoff, winning 20 of 27. The
Generals also picked up more
ground balls, were successful
on 94 per cent of their clears
while limiting Guilford to a 65
percent rate, and scored on
nearly half of their shots while
the Quakers were on target with
less than one fifth of their at-
tempts.

Daly was quick to praise the
Quakers, however. ‘‘If we didn’t
take their stuff away like we

did, they could have beaten us,”’

he said.

The victory comes off Satur-
day’s 10-8 loss to Towson State
where a W&L second-half com-
eback fell short in the fourth
quarter.

“There were a couple of big
plays that looked as though we
had the ball in position to get a
goal and didn’t. Those situa-
tions hurt us,”’ Daly said.

The Generals fell behind 5-2
after the first period as the
Tigers got two goals from
senior attackman Mark Miller,
who took part in seven of the 10
Towson goals.

The Generals, paced by two-
goal efforts from Mason and
senior Barry Waterman, storm-
ed back to pull within one goal
twice, only to have Tiger goalie
Gavin Moag, who ended the day
with 16 saves, shut the door.

“‘We’re fortunate to get out of
here with a win. Washington
and Lee plays real solid
lacrosse,’’ said Towson mentor
Carl Runk.

The Generals (2-4) will travel
to Williamsburg after exams
for a game against William and
Mary in the team’s ninth and
possibly final meeting as W&M
will discontinue its lacrosse pro-
gram at the end of this season.

The Generals will face off
against archrival Virginia, Sun-
day, April 15, in Charlottesville.

Netiers win three of four

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee ten-
nis team won three of four
matches last week to give them
a record of 9-4 before beginning
their Southern tour which
begins April 9.

The Generals began the week
on Thursday by losing a close
match to Division I Richmond
by a score of 5-4.

Concerning the Richmond
match, head tennis coach Gary
Franke said, ‘‘We played really
well and I believe that we were
capable of beating them.”

After losing four of the six
singles matches, the Generals
needed to sweep the doubles in
order to win the match. Franke
said that a lot of pressure was
on yhe W&L doubles teams to
play well, but that they handled
it well winning two of the three
matches.

On Friday, the Generals re-
bounded with a 6-3 victory over
Division III Christopher New-
port. Franke stated that the
match gave a couple of his
players the chance to play
against players who were rank-
ed higher in Division III.
Although Craig Cannon (ranked
21st) lost to Detlof Schulz (rank-
ed llth) 74, 64, Roby Mize
(ranked 35th) was able to defeat
John Mourning (ranked 23rd)
6-7, 6-3, 7-5 after falling behind
2-5 in the final set.

The Generals defeated Salis-
bury State by a score of 8-1 on
Saturday. “I thought that we
really played well that day,”’
said Franke...

W&L finished the week on
Tuesday by defeating VMI 7-2 in
what Coach Franke described
as “the match for the city
championship.”

On April 9, the Generals begin

their Southern tour with five
matches on the road opening
against Division I Stetson. W&L
will play Florida Southern and
Rollins, both Division II
schools, on April 10 and 11
respectively, and finish the trip
with matches against Ogel-
thorpe and Emory on April 13
and 14.

Kelly paces golfers

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

Captain Whit Kelly’s 78 paced
the Washington and Lee golfers
past two of three opponents in a
four-team match Tuesday at
the Lexington Country Club.

The Generals posted a team
score of 326 to finish ahead of
squads from neighboring VMI
(329) and Old Dominion Athletic
Conference opponent Bridge-
water (337). W&L was topped,
however, by another ODAC foe,
Lynchburg. The Hornets took
top team honors with a 321
score.

Coach Buck Leslie said he
was pleased with the team’s
victories and felt the Generals
had a good chance to defeat the
Hornets.

“Lynchburg got a 79 from
their No. 5 man (Peter Burch)
that we weren’t able to pick

up,” he said, explaining that the
Generals were relatively even
with the Hornets at the other
positions. The 79 was one of
three sub-80 scores posted on
the day. Leslie attributed the
low number of sub-80 scores to
the course playing very tough in
the less-than-ideal weather con-
ditions,

Leslie said W&L needs to
strengthen their five and six
positions because ‘‘we’ll need
help from there if we’re going to
win the big matches.”

Leslie also said the Generals
were suffering from a lack of
playing time, citing the cancel-
led matches against Bluefield
and Rochester as hurting the
team’s early season efforts.

‘‘We’ve worked hard,” Leslie
said, ‘‘but we’re just going to
have to work harder than we’ve
been working.”

Roanoke, Apprentice

The Washington and Lee
track depth, which resulted in
the ODAC Indoor track cham-
pionship, was evident again in
the Generals’ win of a tri-meet
with ODAC-rival Roanoke and
Newport News Apprentice
Tuesday at Wilson Field. W&L
had 86 points, while Newport
News Apprentice finished with
49 and Eastern Mennonite had
43.

The Generals also _ par-
ticipated in the Liberty Baptist
Invitational meet on Saturday.
There was no team scoring in
the competition, but a number
of individual Generals put in top

performances.

Junior Mark Pembroke, who
broke his own 800-meter school
record with a time of 1:55.1, and
senior Angus McBryde, who
covered 1,500-meters in 3:59.9,
indicating he may be recover-
ing from a bout with mono-
nucleosis, were two of many
standouts.

“T am very encouraged with
our results this early in the
season,” said head coach Nor-
ris Aldridge. “Our success
depends on a team effort, and
thus far, everyone has been con-
tributing.”’

Triathlon approaches

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
Athletic Department is sponsor-
ing a race next month, and, of
the 20 people who have entered
so far, one of the favorites is a
51-year-old man.

So, all you boob-tube boobs
who’ve been gobbling potato
chips while watching the
NCAAs, get out, jog, get in
shape and enter the race,
because anyone can win a race
against an old man.

Here’s all you’ve got to do:
Get up on the morning of Sun-
day, April 29, and go over to
Warner Center; swim 30 laps in
the pool, ride your bike 12 miles
and then run another 3.1 miles.

Better start wolfing down the
Wheaties right now.

Yes, it’s W&L’s first and
hopefully annual _ Triathlon,
directed by assistant basketball
coach Tim McDonald and a host
of other athletic types.

Although still in its organizing
stage, the triathlon is definitely
set for April 29, with the rain-
date a week later.

‘‘We pretty much have it on
track right now,’’ McDonald
said, not intending the horrible
pun.

Former Sports Information
Director Ken Ries, now the SID
at James Madison University,
is directing the cycling portion

r

of the triathlon with McDonald.
Assistant Athletic Director
Dick Miller and Coach Norm
Lord are directing the running
part and Coach Robert New-
comb is handling the swim-
ming.

And checking in as veteran
triathlete is Athletic Director
William McHenry, who has
completed a course longer than
W&L’s in one hour and 45
minutes.

Although he recently injured
his back, he said yesterday
there was a 50/50 chance of his
competing.

Before his injury, McHenry
said, he was swimming 40 laps,
cycling 10. miles and running
five miles at least five days a
week.

Sounds easy, huh? Alright! I
want you out of bed at five
tomorrow morning, swallow
four raw eggs, put the ‘“‘Rocky”’
tape in your Walkman, run
around Lexington three times,
and . . . oohhh, I don’t wanna
enter no triathlon. I’ll just
watchitonTV.

But for you real Minks out
there, here’s the details. Ap-
plications can be obtained from
Coaches Lord and McDonald
and are due back to them April
21 with eight dollars for
students and 10 dollars for
faculty, spouses and guests.
The field is limited to 60, with
about 20 applications already

Watching for the fun

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

....One of the joys of ESPN is
that it lets you see all the great
athletic contests that you'd
otherwise never witness. Sun-
day, I got a chance to see the
NCAA Division I Ice Hockey
Championship final. The prin-
cipals were the University of
Minnesota at Duluth and Bowl-
ing Green. The game went into
a fourth sudden death overtime
period before Bowling Green
scored to win the game. Now, I
don’t. know how long ago this
championship was played
(knowing ESPN it could be
anywhere from last week to last
year), but then again that didn’t
seem to matter all that much. It
was just a pleasure to watch
such an athletic contest. Here
we had a group of young men
and their coaches toiling. in
relative obscurity, waiting to be
recognized and justifiably so, as
I soon saw. It was refreshing to
just sit back and be amazed at
how enjoyable a good game is
when it doesn’t matter who
wins. Too often (but then, I
guess, it can only be expected)
we’re caught up in the ‘‘Is my
team winning?”’ attitude and
we see only half of the great
plays. We’re so busy hating
“the other team’’ that we miss

the point of watching an athletic
contest. We should simply be
witnesses of athletes striving to
do their best and revel in our
observations. It’s difficult to be
a non-partisan observer, es-
pecially in a sporting event, but
if the opportunity ever presents
itself, do yourself a favor and

ime out...

take advantage of it....

....Returning to the colon-
nade, I’ve been informed I
made a mistake last week. It
was Lacrosse magazine not In
the Crease that said W&L would
reconsider its Division I status.
Machts nichts. Still a thought-
less suggestion....By the way, it
seemed that everytime
lacrossers got within a step,
they took two steps back. Let’s
hope Guilford win (very im-
pressive) has permanently
reversed the trend....Looking
for good things to come from
the tennis team as they make
their southern sojourn over
break. Possible team bid to na-
tionals in the offing...

....Word is Larry Holmes will
fight Gerry Coetzee in Las
Vegas inearly June. With 25,000
watching in a specially-made
outdoor arena, let’s hope this
go-round lasts longer than the

_..Well, I got one of my final
four guesses correct (Ken-
tucky). Fortunately, it will be
the team that will win it all.

...In closing, isn’t it amazing
how good U.Va. is when the
coach—term used loosely—
steps aside and lets his players
play? Perhaps had he done that
from Day One the Wahoos
would have deserved an NCAA

Rugby loses to

UR, throttles
hamsters

The Washington and Lee
rugby team split a pair of con-
tests over the weekend, losing
to the University of Richmond,
24-15, and throttling the club
from Hampden-Sydney, 27-4, to
even their season record at
1-1-1,

Saturday, the Generals fell
short of the Richmond squad
despite the play of Dave Arthur,
who scored a try and Captain
Herb Funsten, who added a cou-
ple of penalty kicks.

Against the Hamsters on Sun-
day, W&L was able to turn
things around in impressive
fashion as Arthur, Nick
Berents, John Miller and Jack
Cleary scored tries and Bill
Jones added a penalty kick.
Charlie Baker also turned a fine
all-around performance against
H-SC.

Contact

(continued from page 1)

Snyder has not traced the
deficit back any further than
the $6,000 negative Contact
balance at the end of the 1982
fiscal year. To do so, he said,
would involve records which
are now “‘in the vault.”’ He said
he would initiate such a search
at Epley’s direction.

Neither of the two University
officials was certain why the
shortfall was not realized and
the organization’s officers con-
tacted.

Contact is provided with mon-
thly, computerized statements
showing the exact status of its
University account. In inter-
views, both Harmon and Slahor
acknowledged having received
the reports.

‘People go by the budget
they’re given,” Slahor said.
‘“‘We’d been allotted the budget,

 

 

so we assumed we had that
much money tospend.”’

“T don’t think it’s incumbent
on the new, entering committee

to be the watchdog for former
committees,’ he said. ‘‘I don’t
think it was up to us to catch it.”

Epley said he expects the
funding problem would have
been noticed when the books
were closed for this fiscal year,
which ends June 30. “I think we
would have blown the whistle
then,” he said.

‘“‘We thought sooner or later
they’d get caught up,’’ Snyder
said. ‘‘We thought they might
have sources of revenue we
knew nothing about.”

‘“‘We rely on the students to
budget and spend responsibly,
spending no more than they
have,” Epley said. ‘‘We got sur-
prised this year.”’

chairman of Contacts ’82 and
’83, said when reached by
telephone in Dallas that he was
unaware of any deficit spending
involving Contact. ‘‘It would
have been quite apparent if
we’d had a negative balance,”
he said.

“TI would tend to think there’s
been some sort of mixup,” he
said. “I have trouble believing
that six or ten thousand dollar
deficits wouldn’t have been
pointed out if they had actually
been occurring.”’

Shortly after Contact’s deficit
problem came to light, it was
determined that $13,500 in addi-
tional funds would be needed to
meet the obligations already in-
curred by Contact ’84 and still
keep the organization solvent,
according to Epley.

An agreement was arranged
under which a portion of the
shortfall would be recovered
immediately from Executive
Committee reserve funds, and
the rest would be realized
through deductions from the
next two years of Contact
budgets.

In the meantime, Epley said
the University would fulfill Con-
tact’s obligations using
‘general University revenue.”’

The plan calls for $2,900 to be
taken from the EC reserve fund
and, assuming the same level of
funding for Contact as in past

years, for $5,200 to come from
its 1984-85 budget and for $5,400
to come from its 1985-86 budget.
‘That means they would pro-
bably reduce the number of
speakers, or get less expensive
speakers,” Epley said. ‘‘The
alternative was to cut out Con-
tact completely for a year or
two, and nobody wanted that.”’
Referring to the $2,900 ap-
propriation from the EC
reserve fund, Epley said Snyder
“could make that entry right
now and capture that amount.”

Thus Epley was under the im-
pression from Slahor, who was
the liaison, that the agreement
was binding.

However, EC Vice President
Dave Judge, who manages stu-
dent body funds, said that the
document in question is a ‘‘ten-
tative agreement” and that the
committee has not voted on it.

He said he is investigating
Contact’s financial status and
will make a presentation to the
committee early in the spring
term.

EC President Robert C. Jene-
vein said that he is aware of the
Situation but has not yet
brought it before the commit-
tee. He said the matter has not
been discussed in executive ses-
sion.

It is titled ‘Proposal for Con-

stating, ‘‘These funds are to be

When informed that the EC
had not approved the funds,
Epley said that because the

the plan had been finalized. °

“By ‘proposal,’ I thought they
‘meant that the terms were

‘They were agreeable to us.”’

He said that Slahor did not in-

Student killed in fire

Fu

house destroyed

by Wednesday blaze

By MIKE ALLEN

Staff Reporter
Washington and Lee
sophomore Thomas John

Fellin, an honor student and
member of the varsity baseball
team, was killed Wednesday in
a pre-dawn fire which
destroyed the Phi Gamma
Delta fraternity house.

Fellin, 19, was co-president of
the fraternity and co-chairman
of the Pennsylvania delegation
to the Mock Democratic Con-
vention. He was on the honor
roll and was a member of Phi
Eta Sigma, the freshman
scholastic honor society.

The fire, which was
discovered at 4:45 a.m., gutted
the three-story building, leav-
ing only the limestone walls and
a pile of charred, mangled rub-
ble.

The cause of the blaze, which
took three hours to control, has
not been determined.

Fellin, whose room was on the
second floor at the front of the
house, is believed to have been
the only occupant of the house.
The school was on spring break.

nity who was asleep in an ad-

joining building,
through a window.
Lexington Fire Chief Keith Ir-
vine, an electrician for W&L,
said that the building was “a

escaped

total loss,’’ and estimated the
damage at at least $200,000.

‘Because the building’s been
destroyed, it’s going to be very
difficuit to determine the
cause,’ he said.

He said that five fire trucks
and about forty volunteer
firefighters, including units
from nearby Buena Vista, bat-
tled the blaze. The entire force
was on the scene shooting water
into the smoldering re-
mains of the house until late in
the morning.

The victim was pulled from
the flaming house at about 5:15
a.m. by David W. Stevens Jr., a
W&L senior who has been a
Lexington Fire Department
volunteer for four years.

Stevens said that Fellin was
on a Staircase and less than six
feet from an exit when he ap-
parently was overcome by
smoke and heat and fell.

‘‘We thought there was a per-
son in the house,’’ Stevens said.
“I went in to do a search and
rescue....his head was on the se-
cond stair’’ from the door of the
side exit which faces the adjoin-
ing building.

Positive identification of the
victim was made by the state
medical examiner in Roanoke
using dental records.

Fire Chief Irvine said the
weight of the water and falling
debris weakened the floor
joists, causing most of the
building’s floors and ceilings to
fall through to the basement.

He said the construction of
the cement-rock house made
the. fire unusually difficult to
fight.

“The stone walls confined the
heat so that our men couldn't go
inside,’ he said. ‘‘After we got
the victim out, we couldn’t go
back in.”’

“Also, the slate roof was an
extreme hazard,’ he added
‘The falling, sharp edges were
very dangerous for the men.”

three floors collapsed into the basement. More photos on pages 2 and 3. (Photo by Rick Swagler)

Unscorched trees against the
front of the house attested to the
confinement of the heat, which
Stevens said was extraordi-
narily intense.

A charred fragment of the
slate tile could be seen deeply
lodged in a wooden railing at
the front of the building.

The building Forte was sleep-
ing in, a former house mother’s
quarters which is connected to
the main house by a covered
porch, suffered only water and
smoke damage.

The contents of one room in
the southwest corner of the
second floor were salvageable.
Firemen could be seen Wednes-
day afternoon carrying the
possessions of senior Carlton
Peebles, including stereo
speakers and a television, out of
the wreckage

‘We were just able to get

enough water in the right place
at the right time,”’ Irvine said.

Some items in the kitchen
may also be salvageable.

The wooden fire escape on the
south side of the building was
undamaged. Fire fighters and
photographers walked up and
down it all day on Wednesday.

One fire truck returned to the
scene at 5:45 a.m. on Thursday
when from his window a nearby
resident saw first smoke and
then a flame in the debris

Irvine said it was not unusual
for a large quantity of charred
wood to re-ignite

Members of the fire depart-
ment worked Thursday and Fri-
day removing debris from the
structure, aftempting to ascer-
tain the cause of the fire

Lexington Police Chief L.O
Sutton, who is trained in arson
investigation, was on the site to

assist in ‘‘determining the
cause and origin of the fire.’
'T suspect it will be some

time before we determine
anything conclusive,’’ Sutton
said.

The remaining structure will
probably have to be torn down
because the limestone blocks
have been ‘‘spalled’? — weak-
ened to the point that the walls

are unsound.
(continued on page 4)

 

| Service tomorrow

A memorial service for Tom
Fellin will be held at 11:40 a.m.
tomorrow in Lee Chapel.

Dean of Students Lewis G.
Jobn said that classes will not
be cancelled.

University Chaplain David W.
Sprunt said the program will be
“simple and brief.”

Tf we goin now, we ‘re going down’

By MIKE ALLEN

At 4:45 Wednesday morning, I
was sitting at my typewriter in
the corner room of the third
floor of the Sig Ep house. For
several minutes, I’d heard a
banging sound next door at the
Fiji house. I didn’t pay any at-
tention to it at first, but the
crashing noise continued.

It sounded like the racket the
trash people make when they
empty the dumpster on Fiji’s
side of our yard. I looked at the
clock. It was too early for that.
PEER

Eyewitness
Account

I went to my side windows
and looked out. There wasn‘t
anything going on in our yard.
Then I turned to the set of win-
dows which faces. our
neighbors. The entire back cor-
ner of the Fiji house was engulf-
ed in flames.

I grabbed the telephone but
couldn’t think of the police
department’s number, which I
dial several times every week
for stories.

I pushed ‘“‘O.”’ “How do I

report a fire?’’ I asked as if I
were three years old.

“‘What city is it in, sir?” the
operator asked.

“Lexington, ma’am.”’

“T’ll connect you,’’ she said.

After hanging up, I looked
around my room. Only one tree
separates our house from Fiji's,
and I fully expected that after I
left, I wouldn’t be coming back.

What’s important? What do
you take with you? At that
point, nothing mattered. I threw
on a jacket and grabbed a pad
and pen. I didn’t even have my
wallet.

I dashed down our fire
jescape. Sixty seconds had pass-
ed since I discovered the fire.

As I went down the outside
stairs and into the yard, I saw
Jim Forte, who had_ just
escaped through his window.
‘“‘Hey guy!’’he said. ‘‘Call the
fire department.”

“T have! Is anybody in the
house?’’ He wasn’t sure. There
were two cars in the yard. That
had to mean there were people.
He said one of the cars was his.
I looked at the burning house.
Somebody might be in there.

I made an initial attempt to
go in the back door, which was
right next to us, and was im-
mediately choked by the smoke.

Perhaps the car had been left
there over break. There was a
car in our yard, too, and the per-
son it belonged to was in South
Carolina. I knew there was no
point in going into the house if it
were empty, or if I was just go-
ing to get myself killed as well.

“Help me yell,” I said to Jim.
“T’ll go in if we know there’s
someone in there.”’

“Fire!” we shouted. ‘‘Fire!”’
And then: “Is there anybody
there? Is there anybody
there?”’

The only-reply was the crack-
ing of timbers and the shatter-
ing of roof tiles. I tried again to
go in the back door. Impossible.

The police arrived. It hadn’t
been five minutes since I put
down the receiver. Sergeant
Richard Rice got out of his car
and took charge. ‘“‘Get away
from the house,”’ he said.

“There might be someone in
there! We have to get them,” I
said frantically.

“It’s too late,” he replied. ‘‘I
want everyone away from the
building!”’

I mentally cursed the officer.
He was the cool professional. I
was the terrified kid who
thought there might be a human
being in there.

Officer Edward Funkhouser

and I went around to the front of
the house, shouting and hoping
to wake up anybody who might
be in the front — there weren’t
any flames there yet.

The two of us tried unsuc-
cessfully to go in the slightly
open front door. The thickest,
blackest smoke imaginable was
pouring out of the top of it.

I panicked and ran to the back
of the house.

“There’s someone in there,’’ I
shouted impulsively at
Sergeant Rice. ‘“‘We’ve got to go
in.”’

“If we go in now, we're going
down,” he said. “If there’s
someone in there, it’s too late to
do anything for them. It only
takes five seconds for it to go
up.”

Ignoring him, I went to the
front of the house. Officer
Funkhouser and I tried again to
see if we could get in the front
door. There was no way.

“IT want everybody back from
the building,” Sergeant Rice
screamed over the officer’s
walkie-talkie.

We went back around into the
yard. Between the houses, we
saw the first fire truck arriving
out front.

When there was nothing we
could do for anyone in Fiji, I
went back into our house, which

hadn’t been in danger, to get my
fraternity brother who was on
the second floor. He’d been
awakened by the noise.

“Is there anyone else in the
house?”’ I asked. We were both
certain there wasn’t.

I went back and stood in Fiji’s
front yard. After a few
minutes, I watched Dave
Stevens bring the victim out of
the house.

Moments later, I saw
Sergeant Rice standing next to
the body on the front lawn.

“If we’d gone in, we might
have saved him,’’ I said accus-
ingly.

We couldn’t have, of course —
the exit the trapped victim
could use had been consumed
by flames when I first saw the
fire. I just wanted someone to
yell at. Desperate people do
stupid things.

“You know what would have
happened if you’d gone in that
building?”’ the sergeant said.
‘In 15 seconds, you would have
been overcome by smoke.

“It’s an extremely dangerous
thing to enter a_ burning
building. Most of the time, you
don’t come out. We tried to go
in, but we couldn’t.”’

“It’s a tragedy,” he said as
we stood there watching the
house burn. “It’s a tragedy.”’

“T think it will have to be
razed,”’ Irvine said.

Early Wednesday morning,
professors, students and ad-
ministrators gathered in the
residential neighborhood begin-
ning shortly after the first fire
truck arrived.

Witnesses who viewed the
blaze in its intial stages said
that it appeared to have started
on the first or second floor in the
southeast corner of the
building.

Earl Poindexter, a W&L
security guard and member of
the rescue squad, said that
shortly before 5 a.m. he could
see the flames from in front of
Washington Hall on the Colon-
nade.

The baseball team, for which
Fellin was an outfielder, re-
turned shortly after midnight
Wednesday morning from play-
ing Virginia Wesleyan College
in Norfolk.

Most of Fellin’s teammates
learned of his death when they
gathered for their regular team
breakfast at 9:30 a.m. at the
Kappa Sigma house.

“Some of the guys had
already heard, but the majority
were told at breakfast,’’ head
coach James W. Murdock said.

Fellin’s number 27 jersey will
be retired. ‘We all decided on
that,’’ Murdock said. ‘“‘It wasn’t

just my decision — it was a

team decision.”’

The team attended the Satur-

day funeral at Sacred Heart
Roman Catholic Church in
Fellin’s hometown of Weston,
Pa., which is in the eastern part
of the state near Wilkes-Barre.

The coach said Wednesday
that Fellin had improved
dramatically this season, and
that he would have played quite
a bit this spring.

“Tommy has always been
hard-working and a tremendous
student,”” said Murdock, who
said Fellin’s grade point
average approached 4.0.

“He was never complacent
with his performance, and was
always trying to improve
himself,’’ he continued. ‘‘He
proved that this year by moving
from J.V. to the varsity team as
a sophomore.

‘He was continuously trying
to better himself both athlet-
ically and scholastically.

‘“‘He-was respected by myself
and the team. He was well-
liked, but not overly outgoing.
Tommy was trusting, loyal and
a very dependable friend.”’

“You can’t say anything bad
about the kid,” said Captain
Buddy Keller, who taught Fellin
in military science for two
semesters this year. ‘If he
didn’t get 100, he’d get a 99, no
matter what you asked him.”’

Richard B. Sessoms, director
of alumni programs for the
university and Fiji’s chapter
adviser, and Dan N. Nolen,
associate dean of students for
fraternity affairs, represented
the school at the funeral.

Sessoms said that Fellin

played a key role in the
reorganziation of Fiji this year.

‘“‘He and Alex Castelli have
been co-presidents,” he said.
“When the Alumni Board of
Control stepped in to try to
assist Phi Gam with the situa-
tion last fall, they appointed a
cabinet of leaders.

“Tommy and Alex, who were
close friends and roommates,
were regarded by people in the
house as natural leaders for the
future.”’

Fellin told The Ring-tum Phi
in January that the reorganiza-
tion had been very successful.

“Everyone is showing a lot of
enthusiasm and there is a big
group effort in everything we
do,” he said. ‘I think we spent
more time on Christmas decor-
ations than any other house on
campus.”’

‘He was a strong student and
had good leadership skills,’
Sessoms said. ‘‘He was a quiet
person. His was a quiet, very ef-

fective means of leadership. It
was leadership through
example.”

“I felt like I knew him as well
as anybody could possibly know
him,”’ said the adviser, who
lives diagonally across Jackson
Avenue from the fraternity.

“He was very highly ar-
ticulate. He didn’t do a lot of
talking, but when he did talk, he
really said something. That’s a
rare trait.”’

On Wednesday morning,
News Office Director Jeffery G.
Hanna reached University
President John D. Wilson, who

was traveling on business at
West Virginia University in
Morgantown.

“Words cannot express my
personal sadness,” President
Wilson said in a statement.
“This is simply a_ terrible
tragedy. This community has
suffered a tremendous loss.

“I feel deeply for Tom
Fellin’s family. My thoughts
and my prayers are with them.
I know I speak for everyone
connected with the university in
expressing our grief over this
tragedy.”

Dean of Students Lewis G.
John notified Fellin’s parents

 

 

FELLIN
Wednesday morning. He said he

spoke with both his father and
his mother, who were last in
Lexington during Parents’
Weekend this fall.

Dean John said that smoke
detectors are required on each
floor of the fraternity houses.

 

 

The fraternities complete
monthly inspection sheets of
fire safety equipment. The last
completed sheet for Phi Gam-
ma Delta is dated April 2.

Dean Murphy said that he and
Sessoms were notifying the
members of the fraternity.

He said that most of the 12
students who lived in the house
will be put in Baker Dormitory.
Some may be put in Woods
Creek Apartments.

Sessoms said Thursday that
nearly all of the fraternity
members had been contacted.
He said the reaction was
generally ‘‘stunned silence and
shock to hear that such a
tragedy had occurred.”’

He said a field representative
of the national fraternity, which
is based in Lexington, Ky., will
be in town when students return
on Sunday.

Sessoms said the house is ful-
ly insured. He said the coverage
was recently increased to
$385,000.

University Treasurer E.
Stewart Epley said the school
does not own the house or the
land. Fiji is one of only six
fraternities in which that is the
case.

He said a portion of the in-
surance money will go to the
university because it has two
loans to the fraternity still

outstanding.
The Zeta Deuteron chapter of
Phi Gamma Delta was

established at W&L in 1868, 116
years ago. It is the sixth oldest
fraternity on campus.

A new survey by the Washington and Lee
sociology department shows that 53 percent of
undergraduates oppose the admission of women,
while over 80 percent of the faculty supports such a

move.

Of the students polled, 34 percent expressed
strong opposition to coeducation, and an additional
19 percent said they were somewhat against it.
Faculty responses showed 66 percent strongly in
favor of the admission of women, with 17 percent
somewhat supportive of that change.

EC to decide if not
reporting is an HV

 

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

Failure to report an honor
violation will be in itself an honor
violation if a proposal by the
White Book Revisions Committee
is approved by the Executive
Committee.

Lee Feldman and Mike Reap,
members of the committee, both
confirmed that the committee
has included the failure to report
clause in its recommendations
for changes in the honor system
to the EC. In order for the pro-
posals to become effective the EC
must approve them twice by a
simple majority.

EC secretary Jim Messer,
chairman of the revisions com-
mittee, said that the White Book,
with all proposed changes includ-
ed, will be presented to the EC
Monday night.

Specifically, the proposed
change would list ‘‘lying,
cheating, stealing or tolerating
those who do’’ as examples of
honor violations.

‘Actually it’s not a change. It’s
bringing back the way it used to
be. It’s a revitalization of an old
White Book,’’ Feldman expilain-
ed.

Addition of law rep goes to student vote

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

Students will vote next week on
an amendment to the Student
Body constitution that would pro-
vide for the addition of an Ex-
ecutive Committee member to
represent the second-year law
class.

The EC adopted the amend-
ment 10-1-1, with President Bob
Jenevein opposed, Monday night.
In order for the amendment to be
adopted, one-half of the members
of the student body will have to
vote, and two-thirds of those

oting will have to support the

amendment. Polls will be open
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thurs-
day.

Four members of next year’s
EC were appointed to work with
the officers of the Student Bar
Association Board of Governors
to develop a plan for SBA fiscal
changes. Law students last week
voted by a three-to-one margin
for the SBA to assume fiscal and
administrative autonomy from
the EC.

Appearing at the EC meeting,
outgoing SBA President Kelly
Wrenn said, ‘‘We’re not talking
ah~' secession; we're talking

a re-allocation of the

decision-making process.”’

The SBA wants to be guaran-
teed a fixed percentage of the stu-
dent activities funds it con-
tributes to the EC with no EC
budgetary review, line-by-line
veto or freezing of those funds,
Wrenn said. If ‘‘an amicable solu-
tion’’ can’t be reached, he added,
‘then we're prepared to go to the
Board of Trustees.”’

SBA President-elect John
Sicilian explained that the SBA
would increase the amount given
to the EC during Mock Conven-
tion years and would petition the
EC if it needed more money dur-
i particular year

EC President-elect Cole
Dawson said he is in favor of
working out a compromise with
the Law School. ‘‘It will cut down
on a lot of the abrasiveness at the
beginning of the year between the
EC and the Law School,’’ Dawson
said.

Dawson, vice president-elect
James White, junior representa-
tive-elect Pat Hayden and
sophomore representative-elect
Shayam Menon will represent the
EC for discussions with the SBA
SBA.

Most of the debate about the ad-
ditional Law School represen

(continued on page 12)

Feldman said he voted in favor
of the proposal because he
wanted to reincorprate some of
the qualities of old White Books
that had engendered respect for
the honor system.

“The point we're trying to
make with this is let’s take the
honor system seriously,’ Reap
said.

Reap added that at first he had
mixed feelings about the ‘‘toler-
ance clause,” because he was
afraid an atmosphere in which
everyone was spying on everyone
else might result from the
clause’s adoption. But he said he
felt it was more important for
students to take seriously their
responsibility to confront some-
one they see committing a possi-
ble honor violation.

When asked about the changes
the committee was proposing,
Messer listed several other
changes, but did not mention the
“tolerance clause.”

‘We haven't completed work
yet, but the changes we've made
this year have been helpful in
clarifying confusion. The
changes we are making are very
substantial. I think everyone will
be pleased with the changes
we've made,’ Messer com-
mented.

Messer said the committee
should finish meeting by tomor-
row and a retyped version of the
White Book with the proposed
revisions underlined will be
available Monday.

Another proposed change in the
White Book is that the actual
pledge will be included, Messer
reported. Messer said it is impor-
tant for students to know the ac-
tual wording of the pledge and to
write it out. However, all work is
considered pledged at Washing-
ton and Lee regardless, Messer
noted.

“Il was all for writing out the
pledge,’ said Feldman. ‘It
makes you more aware of what
you are doing,’ he added.

Duty to be Fair

We think it is time for the law school to get a deserv-
ed third. representative to the Executive Committee.
To bring this about, the students must pass a constitu-
tional amendment, which in the past has been a dif-
ficult task.

It is important for the law school to receive a third
representative to the EC for several reasons. First, it
would give the EC more guidance during honor hear-
ings. Because in most cases a student accused of an
honor violation is represented by a law student, it is
essential for the EC to have the best legal guidance in
preparing for both open and closed trials.

Second, the gap between the undergraduate and
law students has been growing, in part, because the
law students feel they are not completely repre-
sented. Currently there is a first-year law represen-

tative and a senior law representative. Law students
argue that with this arrangement, one class will
necessarily be without direct representation.

Third, working on the EC is immensely time con-
suming and a third law representative could help ease
the burden of leadership which often falls on the
shoulders of one or two members.

The undergraduates, however, hold the key to the
success or failure of this endeavor. For a constitu-
tional amendment to pass, half the student body must
vote, and two-thirds of those voting must vote in favor
of the proposal. Undergraduates must not view this
matter strictly as a law school affair. The amend-
ment would affect all students so it is the responsibili-
ty of all students to vote.

Fighting Apathy

We commend the Omicron Delta Kappa leadership
fraternity for undertaking the series of forums it is
holding regarding student life at W&L. Apathy and a
lack of communication have been discussed quite a
bit this year and finally someone is trying to do
something about it. These forums depend on student
participation to work and we encourage all students
to attend these forums, which will be held tonight and
Monday night.

Tonight’s topic is W&L’s intellectual environment
and the topic Monday night is social life at W&L. The
forums begin at 7:30 p.m. in the Northen Auditorium.

To the Editors:

I would urge you all to support
the upcoming referendum con-
cerning a Constitutional amend-
ment that provides for the addi-
tion of another law represen-
tative to the EC. This represen-
tative would serve dual objec-
tives. Obviously, the person
would represent second year law
student interests in ad-
ministrative matters. More im-
portantly though, the additional
representative would provide an
added source of knowledge in
honor related functions.

The added representative
would benefit all students. The
EC would gain additional exper-
tise in the closed hearings,
thereby helping to prevent any
student from being denied a fair
hearing. The amendment would
also afford the EC an additional
advocate to choose from in the
event of an open hearing. This is
a critical point because the first
year law rep (affectionately
known as the law maggot) is nor-
mally not as well versed as the
defense advocates (I know — I
was law maggot last year).

Finally, the additional
representative would help imple-
ment the honor system in the law
school. Law students are more
likely to know students in their
own class and would be less hesi-
tant in reporting potential viola-
tions to someone they knew. This
would facilitate operation of the
honor system university wide.

Review and Outlook Ll hird Law School EC rep needed

I would be happy to answer any
question concerning this amend-
ment. Please give it thoughtful
consideration and hopefully all
will realize this amendment is for
the good of the university. Thank
you.

Ungentlemanly conduct
will not be tolerated |

To the Editors:

Lately it has come to our atten-
tion that the W&L tradition of
gentlemanly conduct has not
been taken seriously across the
footbridge at athletic events.
These games are not attended by
students alone, and it is a sad
state of affairs when alumni and
parents feel the profanity at
athletic events is so severe that

they cannot bring their children.

to a game. Many parents prefer
to listen to a game on the radio in
order to spare themselves the
embarrassment caused by the
profanity that takes place at
athletic events. This type of con-

duct will no longer be tolerated. ©
In the future, reports of profanity
or ungentlemanly conduct at ath-
letic events will be handled by the
Student Control Committee. If
you find yourself unable to
behave as a gentleman at a
game, please do not attend.
Otherwise, you risk being per-
manently prohibited from attend-
ing these events.
Thank you for your coopera-
tion.

Chairman, Student Control
Committee

Amendment passage urged

To the Editors:

It has come to my attention as a
member of the student body and
more recently, the Executive
Committee, that there is an
urgent need for representation in
the Executive Committee from
the second-year law students.

I say urgent, because the posi-
tion can in fact, be created this
year, by amending the university
constitution. This is by no means
an easy task, two-thirds of half
the student body must vote affir-

- Matively, but the time to do so is

now.
With the conspicuous exception
of the second year law class,

every student body class at
Washington and Lee, under-
graduate freshmen to third-year
law students are represented in
the Executive Committee. It is
time for equal representation,
without exception.

After hearing highly _ per-
suasive arguments for the crea-
tion of a third EC law member
from the Student Bar Associa-
tion, the EC committee voted
strongly in favor of adding a 13th
member. This may never come
about, however, if there is not
strong student support, not only
from the law students but from
undergraduates as well. I hope

Caruthers urges amendment

To the Editors:

I am writing in order to en-
courage students to vote for a
constitutional amendment the
Executive Committee has en-
dorsed. This amendment would
add a Second-year Law represen-
tative to the EC, thereby giving
the Law School one rep from each
class. The change is urgently
needed and has been overlooked
in the past.

From an undergraduate view-
point, an additional law school
student would give the EC
another possible advocate, would
add more maturity to the EC, and
would also keep it more in touch
with what goes on at the Law
School.

Please vote for the amendment
on either Tuesday, Wednesday or
Thursday at one of the referen-

aum polls. The amendment needs

two-thirds of 50 percent of the stu-
dent body to pass.

This year has been cnaracteriz-
ed by attempts, some almost
desperate, to ‘‘define”’ this place;
everyone from Markham Pyle to
President Wilson has tried to put
W&L into words. This is, of
course, silly. Attempts to nail

place usually result in intangible,
emotion-tinged descriptions. This
is not to say that these ‘‘special
aspects”’ (things that set us apart

i
My View

from and above other schools)
don’t exist — just that they are
not easily grasped. The con-
creteness is subjective. The
special dimension to our com-
munity is, or ought to be, the
common denominator of charac-
ter — the shared sense of honor
and integrity of which our Honor
System is an outcropping. This
collective ‘‘nobility’’ is doubtless-
ly nurtured by the all-male
camaraderie and the almost
spiritual presence of General
Lee. Regardless of the source,
however, the shared sense of
honor and integrity is the life’s
blood of everything special about
our community. Without it we are
nothing but an ordinary small

This supposedly shared right-
mindedness, even causing us to
have a ‘“‘System”’ ‘to protect the}
trust, has no definite boundaries.
It centers around the core con-
cept of honor (e.g. lying, cheating
and stealing), but there are fur-
ther implications to expecting in-
tegrity of each other. A lot of
behavior not sanctionable by the
System is nevertheless contrary
to any shared integrity. If we do
want to pressure W&L, then we
should not tolerate such
behavior.

Recently an alumnus had to
take his family away from aj
lacrosse game because of
students screaming obscenities.
How can we purport honor and in-
tegrity while allowing each other
to behave this way? The person
pointing this incident out to me
emphasized the link between
manners and morals. He is cor-
rect; screaming obscenities inj
public, especially in earshot of of-
fendable persons, is a violation of
our common trust. Those stu-
dents who wish to offend others
by shouting in public or by scrat-
ching into elevator doors are
surely a minority here —which is
all the more reason for the ma-
jority to refuse to tolerate such
behavior. I am not, of course,
suggesting that we form lynch
mobs. But some peer pressure in
the direction of what we value
would be more than welcome
these days.

Affirmative Action failing ?

By NELSON PATTERSON
Staff Reporter

Affirmative Action, the govern-
ment regulations requiring the
hiring of minorities in order to fill
quotas, has failed since its incep-
tion, largely because it has
ironically promoted “‘racism and
sexism,’ according to Ad-
ministration Professor Roger
Dean. If programs similar to Af-
firmative Action are introduced,
Dean sees an equally pessimistic
future awaiting them.

According to Dean, a specialist
in behavioral science in the
workplace, Affirmative Action
has “discriminated against one
group in favor of another, the
reverse discrimination dealt with
under the Supreme Court’s
historic 1978 Bakke decision,
which declared racial entrance
quotas illegal for public medical

schools. ‘
“10 promote race is not good

enough without also promoting
merits,’ Dean said.

“You discriminate then against
all groups: women, blacks, Jews,
Catholics.”

Dean referred to the 1964 Civil
Rights Act for further evidence of
the shortcomings of the Affir-
mative Action quotas.

“The Civil Rights Act says you
cannot discriminate against
anyone on the basis of race, sex,
religion, color or national
origin,’ he noted, adding that
presently Gay Rights groups
have tried to include “sexual
preference’’ to that list.

“The penalties involved in
breaking any (of those areas) in
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act

were sufficient to eliminate
racism, but Affirmative Action
has promoted racism ‘“‘by further
deciding not only that such
discrimination should not occur,

but that a sufficient quota or

number should ensure that dis-
crimination no longer exists,”’
Dean said.

The effect of Affirmative Ac-
tion mentality stretches beyond
the hiring process to many
diverse areas, according to Dean.
One such area is education, he
said.

“Only because a student is
black and the teacher is scared of
being called a racist do many
teachers pass blacks,’’ said
Dean. “As a foreigner (to the
United States) and new in 1976, I
was never aware of (the pre-
ferential treatment given
minorities in the U.S.) and the
fear of racism and its label.”’

A native of Bribane, Australia,
Dean says little exposure is given
racism in his native land. The
aborigines never really entered
Australia’s society, he said, and
they are really the only minority
group native to Australia .

‘Australia has formal, legis-
lated racism against non-whites.
The Socialists and the Labor
unions promoted the all-white
policy,” he said. “It limits the im-
migration of non-whites into the
country as well as placing visa
limits on non-whites.”’

“It is totally different from
apartheid (in South Africa)
because it is not discriminating
against those in the country but
those entering the country. Don’t
get confused. Every country has

a right to decide who enters the
country.”’

A second area in shich Affir-
mative Action has had a great in-
fluence is in the recent discussion
over the notion of ‘comparable
worth.”” The comparable worth
idea expands the concept of equal
pay for jobs requiring com-
parably equal levels of skill,
knowledge and duty. It de
emphasizes the actual duties per-
formed in jobs, Dean said, while
placing great weight on com-
parable levels of effort, respon-
siblity, knowledge and working
conditions.

“Comparable worth is more a
male-female issue than a racial
one, but a problem created by
women who want to justify get-
ting higher pay,” Dean said.

Dean cited a recent case in the
state of Washington where laun-
dry workers were suing for pay
equivalent to that received by
truck drivers. The launderers
cited equal levels of skill and
responsibility in the case as war-
ranting equal pay.

“This is dangerous because the
courts will be deciding how much
a company should pay for a job,”’
noted Dean.

He gave a hypothetical case in-
volving a secretary and a truck
driver to illustrate his point.

“(A woman might) choose to
work as a secretary and choose
not to be a truck driver, but then
turns around and says she should
be paid the same amount as the
truck driver,” regardless of her
choice, Dean said. ‘“That’s

wrong.”’

Coverage of honor trial broke Phi policy

. graduate vacation.

By SCOTT MASON
Phi Columnist
When the The Ring-tum Phi printed the
fact last week that a public honor trial had
been held during vacation, it broke policy.
For years the rule has been that infor-
mation about public or private honor trials

is not to be printed. Why? It’s felt that an:

honor trial is for the W&L community only.
“Since the paper goes beyond the com-
munity, we have to be really careful about
what we say,”’ Chief Editor Rick Swagler
explained.

That policy has remained unbroken for
as long as anyone can remember. That is,

until last week when the Phi a took

Reader’s
Advocate

SRA NRO RUE MR EERE SSRN NRRL EH
its policy and threw it out the window. It

printed information about a public honor
trial that had been held during under-
“The thing that
distinguished this (trial) from others is
that students weren’t here. We thought
that there was some sort of duty to tell
students what went on,”’ Swagler said.
That all sounds very generous. But while
the Phi was doing its ‘‘duty,” it was also
turning its back on long-held reasoning for
not covering open trials. Information con-
sidered solely a W&L matter did in fact go

beyond the W&L campus when the Phi
printed last week’s article.

In this kind of Catch-22 situation where
the Phi informed students but at the same
time let the general public in on a campus
matter, the Phi should have stayed by its
traditional policy and not printed any-
thing.

It seems that at least one purpose behind
public honor trials is for students to
witness first-hand the trial process; they
are able to decide for themselves the guilt
or innocence of the accused. Since
undergraduates were on vacation when
the particular trial in question was held,
they wouldn’t have been able to attend the
hearing anyway. And since that purpose
had been defeated, there was really no
reason for the Phi to print information
about the trial. Indeed, the information
was “‘newsworthy”’ only in that it appealed
to a kind of “morbid curiosity.” The
generalities the Phi printed have
generated gossip and rumors about
specifics of the trial (i.e., that the accused
was, in reality, guilty and deserved to be
expelled). All that contributes to the fact
that the Phi allowed a non-campus au-
dience to receive information involving a
private W&L affiar.

Swagler disagrees. He believes that the
vacationing undergradutes needed to
know the trial took place if only to

Strengthen in them an awareness of the

W&L honor system as a whole. ‘Certainly
seeing the trial and deciding for yourself is

one purpose... but it (the trial) is also a
visible sign that the honor system is still
around. Every time that there is an honor
trial, it reminds students that the system is
still there and that it functions,’’ Swagler
said.

As for gossip, Swagler believes that kind
of thing is inevitable. ‘‘I don’t think that by
printing what we did, we generated any
rumors that wouldn’t have been there
anyway.”

Swagler, in fact, isn’t convinced that
open honor trials should be always kept
within W&L boundaries. Coverage of
honor trials could boost parent and alumni
awareness of the honor system, Swagler
believes. ‘“‘They know that the system
works and that we are taking care of
ourselves,’’ he said. This, though, must
outweigh the good of keeping it in the com-
munity, he added.

And that brings us now up to the present.
Although the Phi’s decision last week to
break policy and cover the open honor trial
was a rare occurrence, it may not be rare
much longer. Next year’s editors, Mike
Allen and Bruce Potter, have already
decided to report the results of open trials
next year. Both teams agree that whatever
information they print will be of a general
nature only (the name of the accused, for
example, will be left out.)

The Phi is treading into a very
dangerous area and, what’s worse, it’s
treading carelessly into that area with its
eyes firmly shut. The Phi now has no

policy whatsoever concerning public honor
trials. The policy it did have, the same
policy it has had for years, was the one
that got abruptly killed last week. Now,
Editors Swagler and Cleghorn think they
might start covering open trials, but
they’re not really sure how in-depth their
coverage should be. The same indecision
exists among next year’s editors. It’s this
type of undertainty that can lead to care-
lessness and inconsistent reporting.

In any case, the Phi seems to be ad-
vocating some sort of open trial coverage,
and that’s what is most dangerous of all.
For, by covering open honor trials, the
tendency will be there to dramatize the
event, thereby trivializing the whole honor
system process. There may also be the
likelihood of fueling rumors, rumors that
could taint or distort the character of the
accused. Finally, and most importantly, is
that open honor trials belong within the
confines of the W&L community. It’s a
strange but effective honor system that ex-
ists at W&L, and because it’s different-
from most school’s, outsiders don’t really
understand it. To them it’s Perry Mason
courtroom drama complete with prosecu-
tion, defense, juries and witnesses. At
least that’s the way they’re likely to see it
once the Phi begins covering open honor
trials. And when that happens, the honor
system becomes not the unique, ‘‘sacred,”’
effective system it’s always been, but in-
stead a trivial, unrespected drama that’s
rather like a TV show.

Falwell brings I Moral Majority dogma to W&L

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

Jerry Falwell showed last
Thursday night why he and his
Moral Majority have become
such a force in American politics
in recent years.

In his speech in Lee Chapel
Falwell condemned homosexuali-
ty, abortion, drug use and por-
nography, while giving his sup-
port to Ronald Reagan. Israel,
prayer in schools, a strong na-
tional defense and the return of

what he called morality in
America.
The evangelical fundamen-

talist minister displayed the elo-
quence, wit and friendly smile
that have helped mim amass a
following of millions of religious
conservatives.

Since 1979, when he _ heiped
establish Moral Majority, he has
been preaching these philoso-
phies from the pulpit.

Before 1979, Falwell said in his
speech, ‘We actually were losing
the battle on the moral and social
issues because we had absented
ourselves from the (political)
arena.”

The Moral Majority learned in
1979 through a commissioned
poll, Falwell said, that only 55
percent of its members were

registered to vote, compared
with a national average of 72 per-
cent,

“And of the 55 percent
registered....the majority of
them were not even exercising
their basic citizenship right —and
obligation — of casting a vote.”’

‘‘} think you can see that if they
can be committed not just to a
party or a politician, but rather to
principles,’ Falwell said, ‘‘that
we could in fact have a very
significant role in redirecting the

moral health and goals of this
republic of ours.”

The reason he endorses
Reagan, Faiwell said after the
speech, is the president’s views
on morality among other things.

Faiweil said he expects Walter
Mondale to win the Democratic
nomination, run on a ticket with
Gary Hart and lose the election to
Reagan.

‘(Mondale) is, I think,
Reagan’s best choice as an oppo-
nent, because I think he is a
loser.”’

“T really cannot imagine why
any of Reagan's supporters of
1980 would not also be his sup-
porters in 1984,"’ Falweil said.

He said in his speech that he

believed that by electing leaders
committed to traditional morals,
America would experience what

historians will cail a rebirth.

“The majority of Americans
who believe in the values we've
shared tonight are the people who
put (this country) together, and
they are the people who, like
most of you in this room tonight,
should be having the major say in
the direction of this country.”’

Parents who did not instill in
their children a set of traditional
values produced ‘‘a_ social
disease of materialism’’ and ‘‘a
social disease called rebellion
that —— during the ‘60s and ‘70s
particularly — produced the two
decades that we often call the
Dark Ages of the 20th century,
when this nation almost went to
hell.”’

Most of the audience gave
Falwell a standing ovation at the
end of his speech, which was
sponsored by the College
Republicans. Falwell did not
receive any money for his ap-
pearance.

Falwell was booed at one point
in the question-and-answer
period, though, when he respond-
ed to written questions from the
audience. One person stood up to
press Falwell on the question of
whether Moral Majority has ever
banned books.

‘Where did you read that -—— in
Gay Blade?”’ Falwell retorted.

in response to critics who ques-
tioned whether it is right for him
to preach politics from the pulpit,
Falwell pointed out that if it was
all right for civil rights activist
preachers and the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, it was all right for him.

Creating a liberal plattorm
on a conservative campus

By JOHN WILTSE
Mock Convention Correspondent

There is little doubt that the 16-
member Committee on Resolu-
tions (the Platform Committee)
of the Washington and Lee Mock
Convention has created a truly
Democratic platform. Consider-
ing the generally conservative
make-up of the W&L student
body, such a task does not appear
to be simple.

Recognizing that the platform
is the only part of a Mock Conven-
tion traditionally designated to
reflect student opinion, the
members of the committee
realized that they had to address
this problem from the outset.

‘We had to reconcile student
opinion with actual Democratic
opinion, but here that simply
would not work too well,’’ related
B. Scott Tilley, chairman of the
Platform Committee.

The 1980 Democratic platform
and the 1982 midterm platform
were the primary reference
sources for the committee,
besides the ideas and knowledge
of individual members.

“We decided it was best to

come up with a Democratic plat-
form based on research and have
the student opinion reflected dur-
ing the debate and voting,”’ Tilley
explained.

A good portion of the commit-
tee’s time has been spent de-
veloping the structure of the
debate, which will be held on the
opening night of the Convention.

Each chapter of the platform
will be addressed favorably by a
majority speaker, the member of
the committee who wrote that
section, as well as a minority
speaker who will present the op-
posing view of the planks. These
speeches will each be limited to
three minutes.

It is at this time that any nine
individual delegates on the floor
will be recognized by chairman
Tilley to give a one-minute
speech for or against that par-
ticular section of the platform.

“At the Convention itself, the
platform debate will be the only
place where each delegate will
have the opportunity to express
himself,”’ said Tilley.

Because it is impossible to ad-
dress every issue contained with-
in an entire platform chapter in

the time allotted, the majority
and minority speakers will center
their arguments around the key
issues of that chapter in an effort
to focus and limit the floor debate
that will ensue.

The 15-page platform will be
contained within the delegate
convention packets to be
distributed during delegate
registration.

The tone of the 1984 W&L
Democratic platform, consisting
of five chapters, is set by a
preamble attacking the ‘‘insen-
sitivity of the current administra-
tion’’ and offering ‘‘solutions that
not only meet the needs of many
but reaffirm our commitment to
improve the conditions of the
least fortunate in society.”’

Chapter One of the platform
deals with the economy, stressing
a theme a fairness for all
Americans. Key planks include
opposition to a Constitutional
amendment requiring a balanced
budget and a call for special sub-
sidies for minority and woman-
owned small businesses.

The second chapter calls for
continued commitment to the
passage of the Equal Rights

Amendment, stating that the
‘‘Reagan Administration is simp-
ly not interested in justice for
women.” Also in this chapter,
titled “‘“Government and Human
Needs,”’ is an education plank
supporting an exemption for col-
lege graduates from paying back
student loans if they become
teachers.

Government operation and
reform is addressed in Chapter
Three of the platform, with key
issues being a call for public
financing of Congressional cam-
paigns and stricter handgun con-
trol legislation.

Chapter Four centers on
energy, agriculture and the en-
vironment, emphasizing the Ad-
ministration’s ‘‘short-sighted”’
energy policy. This section
stresses the development of solar
energy and a goal of producing 20
percent of the country’s energy
needs by the end of the century. A
key issue to be raised during the
platform debate will be this
chapter’s inclusion of a call for a
reduction of federal support for
the development of nuclear
power.

The fifth and final platform
chapter deals with foreign af-
fairs. It contains a plank calling
for the withdrawal of all United
States troops (and others) from
Lebanon as well as a condemna-
tion of the Reagan Administra-

tion’s ‘‘war-like actions’ in E]
Salvador and Nicaragua. Al-
though various weapon systems
are called for in this section, in-
cluding the MX missile and the
Trident submarine, a statement
requesting the ‘‘immediate end to
the arms race with the USSR”’
also is present.

“I feel that the platform aspect
is particularly important because
it ties together two integral parts
of what the Convention is striving
for — a combination of student
opinion and Democratic authen-
ticity,’’ commented Tilley.

Each chapter of the platform
will be voted on separately by a
voice vote.

In related Convention news, the
Cable News Network (CNN) has
confirmed its plans to cover the
Mock Convention on Saturday,
May 12. CNN will be joined by the
RKO Radio Network, United
Press International and the
Associated Press, among other
news organizations, in covering
the Mock Convention.

Co-chairman Steve Lewis also
announced this week that a
“kick-off” party will be held Fri-
day evening, May 4, in Evans
Dining Hall for all student par-
ticipants in the Mock Convention
and invited guests. Two bands,
Targetz and Steps, will be
performing.

D Train, Lite Year featured in SABU Ball

 

The feature band at the SABU Ball will be the nationally acclaimed ‘‘D Train” who will play their top

chart single ‘‘Keep On.”

 

 

 

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

Desiring to attract at least 250
Washington and Lee students and
500 members of the public, the
W&L Student Association for
Black Unity will sponsor the 13th
annual SABU Ball on Saturday,
May 5, at Warner Center.

‘We would like to see 250
members from the W&L com-
munity at the Ball. That’s our
goal,’’ said SABU President Ron
Magee. Magee said he expects
total attendance to run between
750 and 1,000 persons.

The ball, which begins at 8:30
p.m., will kick off with the band
“Lite Year.”’ This Virginia Beach
group will play two 45-minute
sets of Top 40 and contemporary

 

music. According to Magee and
SABU Ball Chairman Ira Pur-
year, ‘‘Lite Year’’ will be follow-
ed by a fashion show of spring
and summer wear.

The Ball’s feature band is inter-
nationally acclaimed ‘‘D Train,”’
which has been named best new
group by several polls. Having
just returned from a very suc-
cessful European tour, the band
has seen its single ‘‘Keep On”
skyrocket to the top of the
overseas charts. Another single,
‘“‘You’re the One for Me,’’ has
also been well received.

According to John D. White,
dean of Minority Affairs, all pro-
ceeds from the ball will go to the
Marjorie Poindexter Student
Fund, which provides financial
assistance to students in times of

unusual emergency or extraor-
dinary need. The fund, establish-
ed in 1983 in memory of Mrs.
Poindexter, who died in Novem-
ber, will be administered by the
W&L Office of Student Financial
Aid. Mrs. Poindexter had served
on the Washington and Lee staff
since 1968.

SABU has never kept any of the
ball’s profits, which have always
gone back to the school, accor-
ding to White. ‘‘We hope to at
least put $2,500 into the (Poindex-
ter) Fund,”’ said Magee.

Both Magee and Puryear term
the event a “remarkable time.”’
They see it as an inexpensive, en-
joyable evening featuring fine
music and free hors d’oeuvres,
beer and punch. Complimentary

carnations will be given to all the
women.

“It (Warner Center) looks like
a nightclub,” explained Puryear.

“Everyone on campus is in-
vited,’’ said Magee, who noted
that there are always plenty of
single men and women in atten-
dance. ‘‘We would hope the entire
W&L community would see what
we are doing as an alternative for
that Saturday night,”’ he said.

The SABU Ball was never
meant to be an alternative to
Fancy Dress Ball, although it
may have once seemed that way.
‘In the past, we haven’t gotten
many white students,’ said
Magee. According to Dean White,
the SABU Ball used to be the
culmination of Black Culture
Week, normally about three
weeks after Fancy Dress.

By moving the ball to the spr-
ing, SABU has seen the event ex-
pand. “Last year was the first
year we moved to the gym,”’
“fagee said. According to

 

Puryear, the SABU Ball, now
known as ‘‘The Spring Thing,’
was almost always a week before
final exams, which cut into atten-
dance. This spring date also
makes the ball more accessible
for area citizens and alumni who
worried about weather conditions
when traveling. ‘“‘The ball at-
tracts a lot of people from the
area,’’ said Puryear.

The SABU Ball is the only
minority function in the local
region that is over a decade old,
according to White. ‘The tradi-
tion of the ball has hung on,” he
said.

Tickets for ‘The Spring Thing”’
cost $10 per person and may be
purchased from the Office of
Minority Affairs in Payne Hall or
the Minority Cultural Center at 10
Lee Avenue, two doors down
from the Sigma Chi Fraternity.

The legend about mermaids
has been around for quite awhile,
but never in my wildest dreams
as a child did I envision
something as beautiful as Daryl
Hannah with a tail. This is the
story line of the new release,
Splash, from the people at Disney
(getting a little risque in their old
age).

Flicks
Picks

Tom Hanks plays the basic
lovable leading man who happens
to fall in love with a mermaid
visiting the Big Apple via Atlan-
tis. From the opening scene
where she visits the Statue of
Liberty in the buff, I was in love
with Daryl the Mermaid (the pro-
nunciation of her real name
resulted in several exploding TV
screens, thus the omission).

 

 

John Candy is also in rare form

Daryl’s a Splash

as the hopelessly perverted
brother of Tom Hanks. Director
Ron Howard, of Happy Days
fame, did a splendid job of com-
bining the kind of All-America
comedy Disney is famous fo
with the rowdy slapstick of Candy
and the voluptuous good looks of
Miss Hannah. The net result is an
unusually fine comedy treatment
of a screenplay that could have
easily ended up as kiddie porn.

As for the concept of a mer-
maid for the 80s, the Splash
people did themselves proud by
picking Miss Hannah for the role.
She is fabulously healthy and her
wild blond hairdo was the most
attractive blouse I’ve seen in
years. She is in a word, tubular
(for all you valley people).

So, my advice to the W&L
moviegoer is to definitely go see
this flick because the price of see-
ing a girl redefine the fable is
well worth it, at any cost.
However, one word of caution:
Don’t take a date to this late show
because odds are you won’t be too
interested afterwards. (Unless of
course she can go one-on-one with
Daryl Hannah.) |

It is convenient. You can get a
full meal at a reasonable price.
There are two rooms full of the
latest video games, pinball
machines, etc. These are just
some of the advantages that
Lloyd’s of Lexington has to offer
the hungry student, and yet by
many finnicky eaters, Lloyd’s is
persecuted. ‘‘The last time I ate
at Lloyd’s I got queasy and threw
up,” they might whine. But as

one perceptive chow hound
pointed out to me, people often go
to Lloyd’s having already downed
a twelve-pack, yet they shame-
lessly ‘blame it on Lloyd’s.”’

So is it fair to blame it on
Lloyd’s? Sometimes, unfor-
tunately, it is, but here I will
guide you on how to get the most
out of Lloyd’s.

Can a loosety connected group
of W&L students play well
together in a rock band after only
two weeks of practice? The
Vanishing Renegades, just sucha
group, seem to think so.

“We've already got a 30-song
repertoire, mostly because the
guys in the band are all ex-
perienced,’’ said John Vita, lead
guitarist, ‘“The fact that we have
experience, that we can get a
song down after only a few takes,
makes it fun.”

Fun is the main reason for the
Renegades’ existence ‘‘because it
certainly doesn’t pay well,” Vita

‘Most of whatever our fee is
just rental of equipment,”’
according to senior Kevin

Kadesky, who plays both lead
and rhythm guitar for the band.
“‘We’re all musicians. We all en-
joy doing it.”’

‘“‘We want students to identify
with the band,”’ said Vita. ‘We
don’t want to be put up on a
pedestal. Our goal is to bridge
any gaps between the band and
the audience. All but two of us are
seniors and we just want to have
fun in the spring before we
graduate.”

required some long meetings in

Their repetoire includes David

times the double-bacon
cheeseburger will be melty and
out of this world, and another
time you won’t go past the first
bite. This goes for the chicken
burgers and other sandwiches as
well, and it has to do with
freshness. When Lloyd’s is busy,
it’s better, because they cook the
sandwiches when you order
them, and they’re hot and fresh.
But when you go, say, in the mid-
dle of the night or in the middle of
the afternoon, the sandwiches are
often already made and kept
fresh only by a warming light.
Food like bacon and chicken
burgers need to be hot, not old
and simply warm, to be good.

Yet if you go during odd hours,
there are certain things which
are always good. Lloyd’s has
delicious and very thick vanilla,
chocolate, and strawberry milk-
shakes. Also, the chicken nug-

counted on. They are crunchy on

side, and have a taste not unlike a

Ultimately, the best thing
about Lloyd’s is that it stays open
24 hours a day. I'd be a liar if I
said it was better than Wendy’s,
but late at night, when you've got
no right to be driving, Lloyd’s is
near, cheap and open. And if

Lloyd’s is the place to get caf-

are good, especially the peanut

Not to forget, Lloyd is a nice
guy. He knows many of us by our
first names and is always friend-
ly. And ever since he opened a
couple of years ago, he’s con-
stantly experimented with new
items. Some have stuck, like the
chicken nuggets, and others, like
the stuffed potatoes, have faded
into well-deserved obscurity. But
there has always been an effort
by Lloyd to expand and improve
the quality.

The Washington and Lee
lacrossers were handed a pair of

three-goal losses in the week’s |

two games, forcing them to win
their last three games if they are
to finish the season at .500.

The University of Maryland-
Baltimore County rode the goal-
tending of Chris Caughlin and
four consecutive goais at the
start of the fourth quarter to take
a 12-8 decision from W&L yester-
day in Catonsville, Md. The
defeat dropped the Generals
record to 4-7.

With the Ketrievers leading 6-5,
Caughlin stymied the Generals
seven times in the first five
minutes of the third quarter and
on eight more occasions in the
second half. He had 18% saves on
the game.

Goals by David Johnston and
Barry Waterman gave W&L the
lead, 7-6, before UMBC’s Chuck
Reid scored his fourth goal of the
game to make it 7-7 at the end of
the third. Overall, there were
seven ties and six lead changes.
Neither team led by more than
one goa} until the fourth quarter.

The score was tied 2-2 after the
first quarter. W&L defenseman
Chris John accounted for the
Generals’ second score when he
started a clear at midfield and.
broke through the defense un-
impeded.

In the second quarter, Sandy
Brown scored twice and Lee
Heimert, connected for his 23rd
goal, in an extra-man situation,
_to create a 3-3 deadlock at the in-
termission. °

UMBC’s Mark Hodgkins
started the decisive uprising in
the fourth quarter. His goal was
followed by Mark Gold’s rising
shot that got past goalie John

Let’s not question Mr. Knight's

By MIKE STACHURA

...We saw a good number of
gaping-mouthed reports from the
press this weekend on the so-
called ‘Basketball boot camp” of
Bobby Knight in Bloomington,
Ind., where the 1984 Olympic
hoops team was being selected.
The “Oh my” tone of the

coverage of the tryouts was
almost a questioning of Knight’s
methods. I agree that Mr. Knight
was tough on the Olympic
hopefuls, but I find nothing wrong
with his attitude. Knight sees one
purpose of his Olympic tenure
—and he’s stated it freely — that
being to bring back the gold. Bob-
by Knight. is intense and highly
motivated, but above all, he

knows how to wrench out of some-
one their very best. The boot
camp in Bloomington 1s surely
wustifiable. Knight went into the
Olympic tryouts with some strict-

DiDuro. Then, with 9:31 remain-
ing, Hank Starkey notched his
second goal for a 10-7 advantage.
Greg Goss conpleted UMBC’s at-
tack with goals at 8:34 and 3:24.
W&L's lone goal of the quarter,
by Jeff Mason, made it 11-8 with
7:23 to go.

Saturday, Division III’s 11th-
ranked Denison surprised the

Generals with a five-goal third- -

quarter surge that ended in a 8-5
upset victory for the Big Red.

The Generals countered
Denison’s first three goals. But
after W&L’s Rod Santomassimo

ly defined qualifications for his
Olympic basketball player. He

-wanted, first of all, a solid defen-

sive player, ready to go chest-to-
chest for 90 feet. A very sound
idea because the worst you can
finish with a perfect defense is a
0-0 tie. He wanted quick guards

sense, strong forwards with in-
side and outside capabilities, and
dominating centers with strength
on both ends of the floor. More
importantly, I think Knight
wanted players who made you sit
up and take notice just when they
execute the fundamentals. His
three-a-day workout routine was
an ideal method to weed out — to
paraphrase Tom Payne -— the
sunshine patriot and summer
soldier of the basketball floor. So
let's not question Knight’s
methods. Seems to me, a guy

circled the Denison goal and put
in a screened shot to make it 3-3
with 8:30 left in the third quarter,
the Big Red stunned the 1,000 or
so fans by running off five
unanswered goals. The last four
came within a period of less than
two minutes late in the third
quarter. The outburst proved to
be insurmountable.

A tight defense by the Big Red
and goalie Bill Hall, who came up
with several big saves throughout
the game, frustrated the
Generals and left them surprised.

“There was nothing (from

named Brooks did a similar thing
with a group of hockey players a
few years back....

....Returning to the colonnade,
here’s wishing good luck to a pair
of General squads, track & field
and tennis, as they look to cop
conference crowns over the
weekend. Norris Aldridge’s
track-men have proven their
strength with a 7-0 dual meet
record and let’s hope their good
fortune continues. An_indoor-
outdoor double would be as nice
as it is deserved. And the ODAC
tennis championships will be
here this weekend, starting
tomorrow. It appears Lynchburg
and the Generals will decide the
conference champion. The
Generals need strong showings
from their middle singles
players, Scott Adams and Jim Ir-
win, to back up their strength at
Nos. 1 and 2 with Craig Cannon
and Roby Mize to successfully de-
tend the championship they have

 

scouting reports) to indicate that
they would be efficient at taking
the ball away,’’ said W&L head
coach Dennis Daly. ‘“‘They were
supposed to run with us. But their
defense, especially at midfield,
was better than any team we've
played so far.”’

Denison also took advantage of
several unsettled situations.
Their only goal of the second
quarter came about when Andy
John, brother of W&L’s soph-
omore defenseman Chris John,
scooped up a clearing that went

ways

dominated five of the last
seasons...Good to see the base-
ball Generals right themselves
over the weekend. Looks like they
could be peaking just at the right
time, conference-wise...

dy John fed Chris Painter from
behind the W&L goal to give the
Big Red a 2-1 lead

In the third quarter, a suc-
cessful clear led to Henry
Galleher’s goal that put Denison
in the lead for good, 4-3. Three
minutes later, a remarkable ef-
fort by Jay Dugan gave Denison a
two-goal advantage. The soph-
omore midfielder slipped on the
wet field but kept his concentra-
tion to slap in the ball as he was
falling from 15 yards. The Big
Red was called for a one-minute
penalty for slashing nine seconds
later. But Andy John capitalized
on a two-on-one break during the
man-down situation to create a
three-goal margin. The lead
became as big as 8-3 when
Painter and Dan Waterhouse con-
nected.

“‘T thought our riding game was
effective,’ Daly said. ‘‘The
Statistics showed that they
(Denison) were successful on on-
ly 53 percent of their clear, com-
pared to 83 percent for us. The
difference for them was that the
times they broke our ride, they
were able to get goals off of it.”’

Daly was asked if the Generals
underestimated Denison. He
responded, ‘‘It’s hard tosay. Asa
coaching staff, we put in ad-
justments to their rides. We lack-
ed the intensity of Denison and
weren't as up as they were.
Superticially, it seemed that we
were ready going into the game.”’

The Generals look to get back
on track in Saturday’s home con-
terst against Washington College.

Baseball back into the swing of things

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
baseball team won four of its six
conference games last week and
in the process, served notice to
the other conference teams that it

will be a force to be reckoned
with in the upcoming ODAC tour-
nament.

The four wins improved the
Generals record to 8-11 (5-7 in the
ODAC).

Starts tomorrow

 

The Generals split a double-
header yesterday with Eastern
Mennonite in Harrisonburg. In
the first game, Billy White hurled
a one-hitter, allowing only a bloop
single in the Generals’ 12-0 -vic-
tory.

Freshman Milam Turner led
W&L’s 14-hit barrage with four
hits in as many at-bats. Hugh
Finkelstein had a three-run home
run and Bill Curtiss had a two-run
shot for the Generals, who scored
eight runs in the first four inn-

ings.

In the second game, Eastern
Mennonite scored in the bottom
of the seventh inning to win 11-10.

The Generals battled back
from an 8-4 deficit early in the
game to lead 10-8 entering the
sixth inning. Eastern Mennonite
averted the loss by scoring two
runs in the sixth inning and the
winning run in the seventh.

W&L was led offensively again

The Generals split matches last
weekend, winning at Hampden-

W&L won five of the six singles
matches at Farmville before rain
forced the concellation of the

The Generals suffered a set-
back on Monday at JMU, losing
9. Coach Franke does not
believe that his team played
poorly, despite their losing every
match.

“Madison played extremely
well and they have a very good
team. Thet were surprisingly
good,”’ Franke said.

The Generals did play a couple
of close matches. Scott Adams

matches with Mary Washington
and Virginia.

This weekend the Generals will
host the ODAC tennis champion-
ships as they try to defend their
conference title at the W&L ten-
nis courts. Play will begin on Fri-
day at 9 a.m. with matches from
the first and second rounds of
both singles and doubles. On
Saturday, the consolation round
matches will be played, begin-
ning at 10 a.m. Championship
round play begins at 1 o’clock

The ODAC coaches had not
determined the tournament seed-
ings at press time.

“T think that it will be a two-
team race between Washington
and Lee and Lynchburg,” said
Franke.

A team usually needs to win at
least five of the nine flights in
singles and doubles to acquire
enough points to win the cham-
pionship, Franke said. Franke
believes that everybody on his
team is capable of winning their

flight, but he adds that Lynch-
burg is also capable of winning at
every position.

Franke said that W&L and
Lynchburg are similar teams and
that the team who wants the
championship the most and plays
wellas a team will probably win.

A possible match between W&L
captain and No. 1 singles player
Craig Cannon and Lynchburg’s
Buzz Frey, both of whom will be
vying for All-America status,
could be a major highlight of the
championships. If the two
players meet, it will be in Satur-
day afternoon’s final.

   
    

renfeltz added three hits (two
doubles).

Randy Brown got the loss for
the Generals after relieving
starting pitcher Kirk Breen in the
sixth inning.

W&L defeated homestanding
Bridgewater on Thursday, 5-4,
thanks to a solid pitching perfor-
mance by righthander Breen and
a four-run second inning.

The Generals’ second-inning
explosion came as the result of
freshman Curtiss’ hit, three
walks, a pair of sacrifices and

one Bridgewater error.

WA&L increased its lead to 5-1 in
the seventh after centerfielder
Finkelstein’s home run.
Bridgewater rallied late in the
game, scoring three runs, but fell
one run short.

Breen gave up only one earned

run as three of Bridgewater’s
four runs were unearned.

W&L came. up with its biggest
win of the year Friday by
defeating Lynchburg 11-8 at
Smith Field. The victory was the
Generals’ first over the Hornets,
second in the conference, since
the ODAC was established in
1977.

Freshman lefthander Brown
pitched a good fame after
recovering from a shaky start.
Lynchburg scored six runs in the
first three innings, the big blow
being a grand slam home run,
giving them a 6-5 lead. After the
third inning, Brown surrendered
only two runs.

W&L took the lead for good in
the fourth inning thanks to a
Finkelstein single and _ con-
secutive doubles by Turner, War-
renfeltz and Walsh. Turner had
three hits on the day, as did
catcher Mike Jacoby.

Junior White relieved Brown in
the ninth inning with two men on
base, the tying run at the plate

and no outs. White recorded the
final three outs without allowing
Lynchburg to score.

On Saturday, the Generals split
a doubleheader with Hampden-
Sydney at Farmville. W&L won
the first game 4-3 and lost the
nightcap 10-3.

In the first game, Hampden-
Sydney scored two runs in the
first inning. W&L tied the game
in the second inning and went
ahead 3-2 in the fifth. The Tigers
tied the score in the sixth inning
only to lose the game in the
seventh after Finkelstein came
up with a crucial triple and War-
renfeltz hit a sacrifice fly that
scored the game-winning run.

White (3-1) got the win for the
Generals in the first game.

In the second game, Hampden-
Sydney scored five unearned
runs in the first inning off W&L
starter Peter Detlefs and never
looked back in coasting to a 10-3
victory.

“That was one of the most
satisfying weeks I’ve had as a
baseball coach,” said W&L head
coach Jim Murdock. ‘“‘We came
together as a team, and it could
not have come at a better time.
We are in the middle of our ODAC
schedule and the ODAC cham-
pionships are coming up soon
(May 2-5).”’

“If we eliminate mental
mistakes and big innings, we will
have a very good chance of win-
ning the conference tourna-
ment,’’ Murdock said. ‘‘Our team
goals are still the same as they
were at the beginning of the
season.”’

W&L has several more pivotal
conference games this week. The
Generals will host Catholic in a
double header Saturday (1:30
p.m.) A makeup doubleheader
with Maryville has been ten-
tatively re-scheduled for Sunday

Hang gliding: an ‘indescribable dream’

By PAUL CLARK
Staff Reporter

Are you looking for something
different to do this spring? If so,
maybe Randy Butler, a W&L
sophomore, can offer you a sug-
gestion: hang gliding. For $20-$80
you can learn to hang glide and
experience what Butler calls ‘‘a
dream.”

Currently Butler is trying to
promote interest in the sport,
which has been somewhat on the
decline nationally.

“Because of diminished in-
terests and a lack of certified
pilots, the United States Hang
Gliding Association is lacking in
funds.’ Butler said, but he is also
quick to mention that the local
chapter, the Roanoke Valley
Hang Gliding Association ‘“‘is
very busy and welcomes new
members.”

Butler started flying last
November and has avidly pur-
sued the sport ever since.

“The feeling I got was, well, in-
describable. I think it speaks for
itself...there you are, 2,000 feet
above the ground and you're fly-
ing. You hold your arms out and
its just like a dream...’ However,
the art of hang gliding is certain-
ly not as easy as strapping a pair
of wings to one’s self and jumping
off a mountainside. There are
many safety precautions and
techniques that must be
mastered.

First, one must be certified by
the U.S.H.G.A. The certificiation
process involves a _ witnessed
demonstration of the techniques
you learn in your first lesson.
After certification, one climbs
through the various skill levels in
the U.S.H.G.A.

As Butler explained, ‘‘Hang I is
the beginning classification, hang
2 the novice, hang 3 intermediate,
hang 4 advanced and hang 5 is
pilot status.”’

Pilot status is very hard to
achieve, for it requires specific

techniques that are closely gaug-
ed by the certification board.
Butler himself has achieved
Hang 2 status, a ranking that re-

-quired many hours of practice.

But Butler adds that the higher
rankings are correspondent with
learned techniques and ex-
perience.

“If you get experienced, you
know to fly into a thermal and let
it take you up,” said Randy. (A
thermal is a pillar of air in which
warm air draws cool air in. The
air pushes up, spreading out as it
gets higher, creating a mush-
room effect.)

“The effect is like that of a bird
circling up — the buzzard isn’t
always circling something dead,
but rather he is allowing this
pocket of air to carry him up.”’

Of course, catching the right
thermal and riding it for a long
period of time is a matter of how
good you are and how lucky you
get.

“I know a guy we fly with in
Roanoke who caught a thermal
and rode for 30 straight miles.
That’s a pretty good ride — but
the longest on record is 241
miles.” If you catch a good,
powerful thermal you can rise up
to 20 feet per second. That’s a
pretty fast rise, but you must
know how to adjust to ensure a
safe flight.

Safety is of major importance
and Butler can offer first-hand
testimony that one must be very
careful in flight.

“One day I was flying near
here and a bunch of my fraternity
brothers were watching. I stalled
out and nosedived. Even though I
was only about 200 feet up, I could
have been dead if I had stalled it
out at, say 50 feet and not been
able to pull out of the dive.”’

According to Butler most in-
juries occur during take-off or
landing. However, he notes that
those interested in learning at
Ronaoke shouldn’t worry about
those dangers because the group

he trains with is very conser-
vative. For safety, most mem-
bers use a hand thrown para-
chute that takes about eight
seconds to become fully
operative, although Butler con-
fesses he isn’t using one at this
point because his hang glider is
not equipped with a harness large
enough for him to carry one.

“Even though I’m not using a
parachute I feel safe with the peo-
ple I’m training with. They are
all good, safety-conscious people
who won’t let you proceed until
you have mastered the tech-
niques on your own level,’’ Butler
said.

Butler is eager to add that it is
very easy to learn to hang glide.
There are a few basic instruc-

tions, like pulling the bar toward
yourself to go down and pushing
away to climb, but these are all
learned in the first lesson. You
even get to fly on your first lesson
— even though it’ll only be at an
altitude of about 30 feet.

“Really, flying here in Virginia
is about a 9 month season. The on-
ly rough time is during the sum-
mer months when the air is hot
and dry. But compared to a state
like Colorado, in which conditions
only warrant a 1-3 month season,
there are plenty of opportunities
to fly.”’

The R.V.N.G.A. takes weekend
trips and some weekday excur-
sions to various mountains
around the Roanoke area. Some
trips even carry the group to

places like Pennsylvania, where
the group competes in cross coun-
try races. Whatever the case, a
good time is guaranteed for the
bold adventurer who steps for-
ward to try the sport.

“Like I said, the feeling is in-
describable. Just picture yourself
2,000 feet above the Blue Ridge
Parkway and I think you'll see
what I mean.”

What Randy Butler really
wants is for people to step for-
ward and try the sport. With inex-
pensifve lessons with profes-
sional instruction just 45 minutes
down the road, he’s hoping the
sphere of influence of hang

Golfers take third in ODACs

By MIKE HASSINGER
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee golf
team finished third behind
Lynchburg College and
Randolph-Macon College in the
seven-team field this week at the
Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference tournament.

Coach Buck Leslie said he was
disappointed with the team’s per-
formance and, while saying he
wasn’t making excuses for his
team’s poor performance, cited
several factors that hindered
their play. The weather was win-
dy, Leslie said, which made the
already difficult course even
tougher, and, more importantly,
the W&L academic calendar is
structured so that the team lost
two weeks of competitive play.
Leslie said this break in the mid-
dle of the season makes his goal
of consistency difficult to
achieve.

“‘The calendar caused us to lose
two weeks of prime playing
time,” Leslie added. ‘“‘We just
need to play more, and regularly,
to be consistent.”

Leslie cited several individual
bright spots in the midst of the
Generals’ defeat. Bruce Blythe
and Turner Friedman shot 155
each for the two-round event 36-
hole event and made the all-
conference team.

Friedman “‘saved us from total

Freshman Mike Friedman
fired a consistent 82 on both days.
Whit Kelly was hampered by ill-
ness and did not play as strongly
as usual.

By winning the tournament,
Lynchburg has tied Washington
and Lee for the a ODAC record
with three tournament titles. The
Generals season will conclude

with a make-up match against
Bluefield College in May. This
match was postponed due to bad
weather, which also took com-
petitive play time from the
Generals.

Although the match will have
no effect on the season’s stand-
ings, Leslie hopes for a win. ‘‘We
just didn’t play as strongly as we
could have (at the ODAC tourna-
ment), and I’d like to see us (beat
Bluefield) ,’’ he said.

Law ’86 claims
IM basketball crown

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

It was a case of height vs.
quickness in Tuesday’s in-
tramural basketball champion-
ship game, and this time Law
’86’s height was a little too much
for Phi Delta Theta’s quickness
in the First Year’s 56-44 victory.

The Phi Delt squad made up for
their height disadvantage with
some scrappy rebounding and
quick-handed defense, coupled
with some stellar outside
shooting from Paul James, who
totaled 22 points on the night.

From the outset, PDT was
playing catchup as Law '86 raced

ly and Lamont Carr, the team
leaders who dumped in 18 points
apiece from long and short range
and scored the first five baskets.
James, however, cut the lead to
four with his jumper at 14-10, but
Law I, getting help from the
resurgent Paul Ware, ran off six
unanswered points to lead 20-10.

Phi Delt returned the favor
with a 10-4 spurt of their own
from James and freshman Roby
Mize, cutting the Law lead to four
at 24-20. Law ’86 held on to the
28-22 lead at the half.

PDT was quick off the blocks to
start the second half, using a cou-
ple of ‘‘Oh wow!” field goals from
Mize and James to knot the game
at 28.

Law ’86 regrouped following a
time out and proceeded to take
command of the game with a 22-9
surge midway through, giving
them an insurmountable 50-39
lead.

Copping most valuable player
honors were Kelly and Carr. Kel-
ly was a four-year standout at
Hampden-Sydney as an under-
graduate, while Carr was a
member of U.Va.’s '76-77 Atlantic
Coast Conference championship
team.

polls. ‘‘Given the resources the
EC had and what they wanted to
accomplish, I think they went
about their business relatively
well,” he said.

The sociology survey found
that although a majority of the
undergraduates are opposed to
enrolling women, 62 percent of
the respondents agreed that
‘‘coeducation would be in the best
interests of W&L with regard to
attracting academically quali-
fied students.”

“The big difference is that the
faculty has a much greater
tendency to personally prefer

coeducation than the students do,
but there’s not that much of a gap
when they consider the best in-
terest of the university,’’ the pro-
fessor said.

Novack said the data show that
year in school and major appear
to have little effect on a student’s
view on the coeducation question.

Sixty-nine percent of students
from the South opposed admit-
ting women. Sixty-three percent
of fraternity members were
against coeducation, while 58 per-
cent of non-fraternity members
favored it.

Two-thirds of both faculty and
students agreed that the adoption
of coeducation is likely in the
near future. Fourteen faculty
members said they would not re-

main at W&L if it were maintain-
ed as an all-male institution.

Students and faculty disagreed
markedly in their assessments of
the effect of coeducation on the
social environment at W&L.

Eighty-one percent of the
students said the change would
harm the fraternity system (32
percent characterized it as
‘‘great’’ harm), while only 29 per-
cent of the faculty took that posi-
tion.

Two-thirds of students said the
adoption of coeducation would
result in more restrictions on stu-
dent life, while only a quarter of
the faculty agreed with that view.

As advantages of coeducation,
students frequently listed in-
creased academic standards, a

been elected upperclass law

second- and third-year law
classes. A freshman law

Hammock was the only rising

his challengers all were rising

A proviso to the amendment
calls for Hammock to be declared

for a second-year representative
to be elected in the fall, if the
amendment passes.

A third proposed change in the
system is that the accused in a
closed honor trial should be
allowed to make an opening
Statement, Messer reported. A
closed trial now begins with the
giving of testimony, and the ac-
cused has no right to an opening
statement, said Messer.

Feldman said he was the only
member of the committee to op-
pose the right of the defendant to
an opening statement. Feldman
said if the defendant is allowed to
make an opening statement the
strength of the opening statement
would play too large a-role in the
outcome of the trial.

“You let the accused define
what facts are relevant,’
Feldman said. ““You make your
evaluation of a person in the first
five minutes after you meet him.
I think you will judge him then,”
concluded Feldman.

Feldman also said that the
committee is recommending a
better orientation program in the
honor system for freshmen and
first-year law students. Feldman
added that it was important that
upperclassmen be made aware of
the changes in the honor code
because ignorance is not an ex-
cuse for an honor violation.

Messer said that in general he
was pleased with the committee’s
work and considered the
presence of four law students on
the committee to have been par-
ticularly helpful. Although he
said the law students and
undergraduates frequently
agreed, Messer said he felt the
law students added a viewpoint to
the discussions that under-
graduates do not typically hear.

Feldman said he felt the pro-
cess was good, but he would have
preferred to have more non-EC
members on the committee.
Three EC members are on the
committee.

‘Since the EC as a whole has to
vote on the changes, I think you
get more impact if you have more
non-EC members and law stu-
dents,’’ said Feldman.

Although Feldman said he
disapproved of some of the pro-
posed changes and probably
would speak out against them, he
added that most of the changes
will improve the system.

“This should be an ongoing
dynamic honor system and not a
static one,” argued Feldman.

Reap said he, too, was satisfied
with the process. Reap described
the process as a_ balancing
system between the need to
tighten the system and the need
to preserve the rights of the ac-
cused.

“I’m very happy with the com-
mittee for this reason. People
were open to possibilities, and
there was a lot of good discus-
sion,”’ Reap said.

‘Although the system’s not
perfect, as long as we keep
reviewing it and keep balancing
the needs of the accused and the
need for maintaining an effective
honor system, I think that stick-
ing with the system will prove

beneficial to W&L,’’ Reap
asserted.
Law students on the committee

are Reap, Jill Faustini, Thomas
Lisk and Steve Grist. Under-
graduates on the committee are
Feldman, Messer, Cole Dawson,
James White and Chris Carter.

EC reps
tell dean
of dispute

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

Letters submitted to Dean of
Students Lewis G. John charge
that a counsel for the accused at
Thursday’s open honor hearing
threatened and physically at-
tacked one of the Executive
Committee advocates during a
pre-trial conference.

EC President Bob Jenevein
and senior law representative
Jim Green said in the letters that
‘the incident involving John L.
White, the University’s director
of minority affairs and a law stu-
dent, occurred last Wednesday
in a law school meeting room.

White was one of two ad-
vocates for a student who was
found guilty by a student body
jury of ‘‘gaining unfair
academic advantage on a
Biology 100 examination by tak-
ing it in an unauthorized location
and/or using unacknowledged
and unauthorized aid.”’

All three parties say the con-
frontation occurred after a
disagreement over the ad-
missibility of a piece of
evidence.

“They’re dealing with in-
dividuals,’’ Dean John said. “‘I
should make no comment on
that.”

Kelly M. Wrenn, president of
the Student Bar Association and
chairman of the hearing, said he
witnessed the incident in ques-
tion but would have no further
comment at this time.

Green said that about half an
hour into the meeting, White,
who was about 15 feet from him
at the time, ‘‘screamed in a
moderately loud voice, ‘Don’t
f--k with me, Green.’ ”’

Green also quoted White as
saying, ‘I’m going to kill you,
Green. I’m going to get you.
You’d better watch out.”’

EC votes
tolerance

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

A proposal to make failing to
report an honor violation an
honor violation itself was re-
jected 9-1 by the Executive Com-
mittee Tuesday night.

However, the EC voted to
change the language in the en-
forcement section of the White
Book to say that a student must
either confront a person he
suspects of committing an honor
violation or report the possible
honor violation to an EC mem-
ber. Previously, the White Book
said that a student should
confront the student or report
the possible violation.

In order for the proposed revi-
sions to be included in the White
Book, the EC must approve
them by a simple majority a se-
cond time.

The original proposal to make
failing to report an honor viola-
tion an honor violation itself was
defeated after little debate.

drew Caruthers said that he

Grand jury opposition builds

Former waitress, 23, organizes anti-probe meetings

By ALLEN REESE
and
TORI RICHARDSON
Special To the Phi

Angela Fawcett, a 23-year-old former waitress,
has emerged as a central figure in the opposition to
Commonwealth’s Attorney Beverly ‘‘John’’ Read’s
special grand jury investigation of drug trafficking
in Rockbridge County.

Fawcett has appeared three times before the
special grand jury and has organized a public
meeting that gave people a forum to express their
concerns and ask questions about the way the grand
jury is conducting business.

Fawcett’s frankness about her past police record
and use of drugs is at first disarming. The slim
brunette said she has used LSD, marijuana and co-
caine. She said she gave up using cocaine because
she didn’t like it. But Fawcett obviously sees

nothing wrong with the use of pot.

‘Pot has been here as long as I have known, and
as long as my grandparents have known, and the
special grand jury will make no differenoe. In 25
years people of this area will look back — when
marijuana is legal, and taxes are being collected on
it — and laugh at all the money and time that has
been put into this.”’

‘‘How is John Read going to justify the expen-
ditures of the special grand jury, a police dog and
the use of a helicopter in a small town where the use
of drugs is no more common than in any other
place?”’ she asks.

Originally from Charleston, West Virginia,
Fawcett now lives just outside of Lexington in the
Willow Springs housing complex. Her apartment is
small, but big enough for herself and her three-
year-old daughter, Shandah.

down
clause

behind the “‘tolerance clause,”’
but did not think that failing to
report an honor violation should
also be an honor violation.

The ‘‘tolerance clause’ was
debated much more extensively
Monday night, when the EC read
through the White Book Revi-
sions Committee’s proposals for
the first time.

Former EC President Bennett
Ross told the committee that the
tolerance clause would be
almost impossible to enforce.
Ross also argued that by ex-
panding the parameters of the
honor system, the EC would en-
danger the entire system.

“No longer does it become a
system in which I’m responsible
for my own actions. A guy who
reports an honor violation should
want to do it because of the
honor system, not because I feel
responsible to do it,’’ said Ross.

Vice President Dave Judge
and sophomore representative
James White both reported that
they believed many students op-
posed the “‘tolerance clause.”

“T’ve heard it called a
‘squealer rule,’ ’’ White said.

Lee Feldman and Jill Fau-
stini, members of the Revisions
Committee, both spoke in favor
of the ‘‘tolerance clause’ at the
Monday night meeting.

“You cannot want an honor
system and not want to be
responsible, too,’’ Miss Faustini
said.

Feldman called the EC’s deci-
sion not to make failing to report
an honor violation also an honor
violation ‘‘spineless.”’

“It’s gotta be strong, but it
can’t be an honor violation,”’
said EC Secretary Jim Messer.

The EC approved the revised
language by a 9-0 vote, with two
members abstaining.

In other action, the EC re-
jected a proposed revision to
change the composition of the
committees that investigate
honor violations from two EC
members and one member of the

Review and Outlook

 

Splitting Roles

When the news of the altercation between Minority
Affairs Director John White and EC law rep Jim
Green first circulated we were initially surprised and
appalled. We understand that the atmosphere sur-
rounding an open honor trial can become very tense.
But a reaction as violent as White’s is clearly innap-
propriate.

‘The most important question now is exactly how the
University will handle the problem. White, who has
been director of the minority affairs office since 1979
and is currently a second-year law student, maintains
that if he is treated as an administrator rather than as
a student such a disciplinary approach would be ‘‘a
little cheap.”’ This rationale seems to us to be a bit
blurred.

As Executive Committee President Bob Jenevein
noted, White is primarily a University administrator.
He is trusted with the management of an immensely
important office within the operation of W&L.
Therefore his character as a Washington and Lee ad-
ministrator should be examined and not simply as a
student appearing before the Student Control Com-
mittee.

The circumstances which allowed White to serve as
an accused’s advocate in an open honor trial are in-
deed unusual. Such a case involving an admin-
istrator/student presents a complicated conflict in
the handling of this case. It is our simple concern that
White be considered by the University as an ad-
ministrator and that this case is not treated simply as
another student-to-student incident.

Letters

Coed may not be solution

A copy of this letter was sent to
The Ring-tum Phi for publica-
tion,

To the Board of Trustees:

I am writing in response to Mr.
Jack Warner's letter of April 20,
1984, urging an expression of
opinion on the upcoming co-
education decision at Wash-
ington and Lee University.

I believe that my constant
association with the University
since graduation in 1974
qualified me to give an informed
response to his thought-
provoking letter. I am the son of
an alumnus, I have served as
Washington, D.C., Alumni
Chapter President, I have
organized a yearly scholarship
grant, I have served as an alum-
ni admissions representative, I
have guest lectured in the Jour-
nalism School, and I have con-
tributed regularly to the annual
fund.

Although I have a definite
opinion on co-education, I have
not written specifically to give
that opinion. The primary pur-
pose of this letter is to express
my concern over the way the co-
education choice is being ap-
proached. Using the decline in
the college age population as
justification to push the adoption
of a coeducation plan ignores the
real problem faced by the ad-
missions office.

I find it most curious that
coeducation is being approached
from a demographic standpoint
rather than a philosophical one.
The philosophy of all-male
education at W&L is not an issue,
but rather the need to institute
coeducation is based on
demographic proof. I submit
that the Board of Trustees is be-
ing made a victim of scare tac-
tics used by those who would
manipulate numbers to their
own advantage. As a marketing
executive, I am all too familiar
with the way demographics can
be used as justification for any
purpose the user wishes.

The real problem is one of
modern marketing. Washington
& Lee is behind the times in this
area, relying on reputation and
visits of admissions officers to
do the job. Today’s competitive
marketplace demands that
Washington & Lee enter the race
with modern thinking. To this
point the Board of Trustees have
been less than responsive.

The admissions department is
not given the modern marketing
support that today’s market
demands to properly represent
the University, hindering the ad-
missions officers from ac-
complishing their goals. The
demographic trends are being
used by the Board as an excuse
to institute coeducation, not as a
reason. The quality of education
offered by W&L, the reputation
and visibility of the University’s
numerous famous graduates,
and the vast number of eligible
potential applicants from across
the country should insure that
the University has the best ap-
plicants from across the country
to choose from. However, this is

not the case. The reality is that
Washington & Lee is already
beginning to settle for accepting
some applicants who are not up
to the University’s standards.
Why? Because the Board of
Trustees has not seen where the
real need is. They want to use
coeducation as a bandage that
will repair the damage done by a
Board who is satisfied with

' marketing techniques that are

amatuerish, dated, and provin-
cial. Admissions officers need
the advantages of professional
marketing support; the same
tools used by universities who
have much more of an eye on the
future. Co-education without a
change in attitude toward the
total marketing of the Universi-
ty is only a temporary solution.
What, may I ask, happens should
the quality of applicants still
decline after a coeducational
program is in place? Is it only
then that the Board of Trustees
will wake up to the real prob-
lem?

If the Board of Trustees is
really interested in guarantee-
ing the high standards of the stu-
dent population and the con-
tinued success of its educational
goals, they should table the issue
of coeducation until they can
focus their attention on a perma-
nent solution to the real problem
W&L faces.

Retain the services of a top
public relations and publicity
firm that will work with W&L to
develop and carry out a strategy
designed to make the ideals, ad-

vantages and realities of life at
Washington & Lee known to the
American public. A concerted
effort in this area would surely
satisfy the long term needs of the
University by enhancing the
school’s image and desirability
at a lower financial cost than the
alternative imposition of
coeducation. At the same time, it
would not alienate a majority of
the alumni and student com-
munities.

I suggest that this tactic be us-
ed for a two-year period within
which you can easily judge the
results. Should this effort alone
not be fruitful, then, and only
then take up coeducation as an
additional solution.

I submit the above observa-
tions in the hope that you will see
that you are focusing on a sup-
posed solution that does not cure
the problem. Coeducation should
only be addressed as an option
on its own merits.

Washington & Lee is unique in
its education experience. That
experience translates to a life
and character-molding effect
that reaches far beyond the
classroom. Coeducation for the
wrong reasons will destroy that.
I for one will not support a
university, coed or not, that does
not reflect the individuality of
the character of the _per-
sonalities it has spawned. Prob-
lems should be addressed with
solutions, not makeup!

Would you like whine
with your meal, sir?

To the Editors:

It would appear that at long
last the accumulated effects of
countless dosages of mass pro-
duced fried chicken have
rendered the tastebuds of your
galloping gormand null and
void. I, too, am a “‘perceptive
chowhound”’ in my own right, as
well as an all too frequent patron
of that ‘Fine Fast Food’
establishment Mr. Curran so
generously accommodated in his
most recent article. Imagine,
then, my sense of shock and em-
barrassment to find my personal
hero, and an inspiration to
garbage-pallattes everywhere
(he was, after all, the man who
wasn’t afraid to tell the truth
about Long John Silver’s), at-
tempting to relieve our friend on

Washington Street of his well
deserved status as official brunt
of worst-food-in-town criticisms.

Like Mr. Curran, I have also
noticed that the Chicken Nug-
gets have a taste ‘‘not unlike that
of a good fried oyster.’’ However
I think it should be pointed out
that these prefabricated morsels
aspire to be judged within the
category of poultry, not seafood.
Would it not be equally astute to
assert that the french fries have
a taste ‘‘Not unlike that of a good
chilled possum entrail?”’

I chastize Mr. Curran for
lashing out at those of us who
reserve the right to whine and
puke after eating a meal so poor
it would make you want to slap
your grandma’.

IFC asks SAC to recommend two-week Rush

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

The Interfraternity Council
planned to propose a two-week
Rush calendar, with a maximum
of two beer parties for each
fraternity, at today’s Student Af-
fairs Committee meeting, IFC
President David Perdue said
Tuesday.

The proposal, made in re-
sponse to a report by the Ad Hoc

Committee on Fraternity Af-
fairs, is a compromise of the
committee’s recommendation of
a dry, one-week Rush and
previous Rushes ranging from
two to four weeks with the oppor-
tunity for up to nine beer parties.

The University Council, which
has the final vote on the Rush
calendar, held its last meeting of
the year this afternoon at 4:15, at
which the SAC was scheduled to

make its final recommendation.

Perdue said he thought the UC
would agree to whatever calen-
dar the SAC proposed.

“I think they (the UC) will just
go on SAC’s recommendation,
because they have respect for
the Student Affairs Committee,’’
Perdue said.

But he was less sure about
whether the SAC, consisting of
five faculty members and five

H-SC student’s death still

a mystery after a month

By JOHN CLEGHORN
Chief Editor

As Hampden-Sydney College
seniors prepare this week for
their Sunday graduation, police
and College officials are still baf-
fled by the mysterious death
of one of their classmates almost
a month ago.

Jeffrey Neville Friend, a 22-
year-old economics major, was
killed April 4 when he leaped
nude onto the hood of a passing
car on U.S. 360 near a small town
about 20 miles south of Hamp-
den-Sydney.

Police found Friend’s car
about 100 yards down the road
alongside a ditch where his
clothes and wallet were also
found.

Officers conducting. a state
police investigation have ruled

out the possibility of a robbery in
the strange incident, according
to. Sgt. B.R. Ritenour of the
Virginia State Police who is
working on the investigation.

Ritenour said Friend had stop-
ped at a gas station about one
hour and 45 minutes before he
was killed and had paid for
gasoline with a check because he
had no cash. He said Friend ask-
ed the attendant to sketch a map
of the route back to Hampden-
Sydney and the attendant said
Friend seemed dazed and con-
fused.

“It’s not a difficult route back
to Hampden-Sydney from
there,”’ Ritenour said.

He said that state police were
proceeding with the case as a
criminal investigation and were
trying to to retrace Friend’s
steps on the rainy night of the ac-

ities ~wai{ {its usta Fil} ites

cident. Police in Keysville, a
town near the site of the acei-
dent, are not pursuing the case
but leaving it entirely to the

- state police.

Dr. Gregory Wanger, who per-
formed the autopsy after the ac-
cident, said that a toxicology
test, an analysis of body fluids
and tissue that determines
whether drugs or alcohol were
present at the time of death, had
been performed and that the
results would not be available
for over a month.

According to Ritenour, tox-
icology’ tests are not always
routine, but because of the
curious circumstances
surrounding the death, he
thought the test might provide
some helpful information.

students, would approve the
IFC’s proposal, prepared by the
IFC’s Rush Committee.

The SAC turned down an
earlier IFC proposal of a three-
to four-week Rush.

“They’re probably going to
want (Rush) cut down even
more,”’ Perdue said, ‘‘but I think
there’s really no way we can cut
it down more than we’re doing
now.”

The specifics of the IFC’s pro-
posal of the calendar, Perdue
said, include ‘‘intense’”’ rushing
during Orientation Week, with
less activity during the first
week of classes.

This way, Perdue said, ‘“The

freshmen get an opportunity to

pledge and be finished with Rush
after the first week of school.”’

The proposal will bring back
more one-on-one communication
between freshmen and fraterni-
ty members, without inter-
ference from the Rush-party at-
mosphere, Perdue said. But at
the same time he said he wanted
to include one big beer party so
freshmen could see that side of
the fraternities also.

Associate’ Dean of Students
Dan N. Murphy, an SAC
member, said that the SAC and

the IFC are working together to
construct a calendar suitable to
both committees.

“IT would imagine there will be
a compromise somewhere be-
tween the wishes of the two
groups,’’ Murphy said.

“‘T agree with some of (the Ad
Hoc Committee’s) ideas and see
the need for improvement,”’ Per-
due said, ‘‘but I think we need to
have a say in this also and not
have anything forced upon us.”’

“They can’t ask for much
more of a change from this year
to next year. We’ve made very
wide changes in it, cut down on
everything they wanted us to,
and kept very much in the spirit
of what they wanted,’’ he added.

The other suggestions made
by the Ad Hoc Committee,
chaired by Professor John
Evans, who is also an SAC
member, won’t be taken up by
the IFC and SAC until next year,
Perdue said.

“We're working primarily on
the Rush question,’ Murphy
confirmed, ‘‘because it’s the
more pressing matter,” since
the UC today finished its
schedule of meetings for this
year, ‘‘and we need their ap-
proval.”’

‘Even my friends were alienating me’

(continued from page 1)

There are oriental tapestries
draped across the walls and
paintings that compliment a
serene atmosphere. Pictures of
Fawcett’s friends and family
line one wall near the stereo,
which fills the room with sounds
of Creedence Clearwater
Revival.

After Shandah is given over to
a trusted neighbor to go shop-
ping, Fawcett sits down Indian
style in her armchair and lights
a cigarette. She begins to ex-
press her dire concern over the
way officials have been dealing
with her and many others before
the grand jury.

‘Read is calling all of these
high school students in and mak-
ing them divulge information
without informing them that
what they say before him can be
used to incriminate them later.
These poor kids and _ their
families are not familiar with
how the judiciary system works,

present.”’

Fawcett said that the injustioe
done to these teenagers, along
with the number of people she
had met who wished to express
their opinions in public, promp-
ted her to organize the April 10
meeting at the Lexington Fire
Department. The meeting was
Fawcett’s idea, and she primari-
ly financed it. ‘‘Most of the ads
were paid for from my own
pocket,” she said.

Over 50 people were reported
to have shown up for the
meeting. Approximately $65 was
contributed to help pay for the
ads and to organize the second
meeting, according to Fawcett.
There was a $50 bill contributed
anonymously the night of the
meeting.

Fawcett used to work at the
Howard Johnson’s north of Lex-
ington as a waitress. Now she

payments and another $114 a

turning away from her, she said,
because of the controversy that
she has been generating. When
she talks about it she seems both
angry and sad. ‘‘I went to a par-
ty and was asked to leave,’
Fawcett said. ‘‘I was angry that
even my friends were alienating
me in fear that they too would be
arrested or brought before the
special grand jury.”’

In her first appearance before
the special grand jury March 22,
Fawcett was asked questions by
Read for over three hours, she
said. Larry Mann, a local at-
torney, was with her to advise
her on her rights. At this time,
she said she admitted that she
had bought LSD from a man in
Roanoke on more than one occa-
sion. She said she never bought
more than 50 “hits” of LSD. A
‘‘hit’”’ is a drug-saturated square
of construction paper that sells
for between three and six
dollars.

Though she met with the man
three times, Fawcett testified
that she could not describe him
because each time they met his
face was hidden from her in
some way. Either he wore a
motorcycle helmet or his face
was not in the light, she said.

But she did know his name.
When Fawcett was asked to tell
the grand jury his name she
refused, saying that she was the
only person in this area that he
did business with, and that if she
gave them his name it would
place her life and her daughter’s
life in danger. When she refused
to answer, Read told her that she
would be held in contempt.

On April 11 Fawcett appeared
before a judge on the contempt
charge. Prior to the hearing she
had heard that the man who sup-

 

plied her with the LSD had been
killed in a motorcycle accident.
She confirmed this by checking a
report in a newspaper. At that
point, she said she felt safe to
give the judge the name.

Also during her first ap-
pearance before the grand jury
Read asked her for a list of the
people she had hired at various
times to babysit her daughter.
She refused to do this, making an
insulting comment and telling
him that it was ‘none of his
business. Fawcett said she
thought that she would be held in
contempt for this too, but Read
dropped the matter.

Because of these events and
her views, she said she believes
that she is being harassed.
Recently her apartment has
been searched. In addition she
has been repeatedly pulled over
while driving, had her car im-
pounded and been afraid that
Shandah would be taken from
her.

During her testimony before
the grand jury, Read is said to
have made some vague state-
ments that he thought her
daughter would be better off if
she were taken from Fawcett.

Larry Mann has confirmed
that Read did give her cause to
worry. The day after her
testimony, Jeff Peck of Protec-
tive Services appeared at her
door to see if the child was well

- cared for. Fawcett said that she

had already sent Shandah to live
with her grandparents. She
suspected that Peck had gotten
instructions from Read to come
over. Though Read denied it,
Mann called Peck’s visit, ‘‘too
coincidental.’’

This was not the first time that
Peck had come to her apartment

Special grand jury granted

A 30-day extension to May 24
has been granted to the special
grand jury investigating drug
trafficking in Rockbridge Coun-
ty.

Under state law, the investiga-
tion would have expired six
months from the Oct. 24 im-
panelling of the jury. The special
grand jury will make its recom-
mendation to a regular grand
jury, which can be reconvened to
issue indictments at any time.

Last month, a special counsel
was named to assist the panel at
the same time that opponents of
the investigation became _in-
creasingly vocal.

Former U.S. Attorney Leigh
B. Hanes Jr. said when he was
appointed last month that his in-
volvement would be ‘‘a limited
thing. It was concurred in by
(Commonwealth’s Attorney)
John Read to tackle a particular
problem that has come up. This
is absolutely not a reflection on
the performance of the com-
monwealth’s attorney.”’

Hanes, 66, graduated from
Hampden-Sydney College and
has a private law practice in

Fincastle.

Circuit Court Judge George E.
Honts III, who appointed Hanes,
said the action came at the re-
quest of the grand jury foreman.
‘It appears the grand jury had
gotten into a sensitive area and
felt the need for outside
counsel,”’ he said.

“T am not at liberty to tell the
basis of the request. The ap-
pointment is not intended in
anyway to reflect on Read’s ac-

tivity. He will not review any- »

thing John has done. I advised
[Read] of what was going to be?
done, and he agreed.”

“There was one matter that
came up and the grand jury re-
quested a special counsel,”’
Read said at the time of the ap-
pointment. ‘‘I certainly agreed,
as it relates to that one very sen-
sitive matter.”’

“IT think Mr. Hanes is
outstanding,’ he continued. ‘‘I
respect him immensely.”’

Meanwhile, more than 50 peo-
ple met at the Lexington fire sta-
tion last month to discuss con-
cerns about local law enforce-
ment and the drug investigation.
The session was moderated hy

or her first brush with the law.
She had been arrested previous-
ly for driving while intoxicated
and assaulting a police officer.
The assault happened while she
was intoxicated, and she was
released with a suspended
sentence. Some time ago she
was a witness in a murder in-
vestigation in White Sulphur
Springs, .W.Va.

Still seated in her armchair,
while friends wander in and out
to drink from a keg of beer in the
bathtub, Fawcett spoke of leav-
ing the area after the grand jury
investigation is over.

“I have made a deposit on a
place to live and have a job offer
in another town, if I can move by
the fourth of June.”’ -

Before then she hopes to hold
another meeting to discuss the
tactics of the special grand jury.
This time Fawcett hopes to get
permission to hold the meeting
in the Lexington High School
gym. She is trying to get a list of
the people brought before the
grand jury so they can be in-
vited. She also wants to invite
Lexington Police Chief L.O. Sut-
ton, Read, Rockbridge County
Sheriff S.M. Reynolds, Lex-
ington Mayor Charles Phillips —
and City Manager John V.
Doane so they can answer ques-
tions.

She concluded, ‘‘I feel like
what is done in the privacy of
your own home, as long as it
does not tremendously affect
anyone else, is your own
business. I feel the money that is
being spent could be better used
on drug rehabilitation programs
or family counseling.’’ At least
one W&L fraternity is collecting
money to assist in the organiza-
tion of the new meeting, she
said.

Also attending was law pro-
fessor J. Timothy Phillips, a
member of a committee recently
appointed by the local bar
association to study the ad-

The two-hour meeting was
organized by Angela Fawcett,
23, of Lexington. “I think this
shows there are still a lot of
questions that need to be
answered,” she said the night of
the meeting. ‘‘The next step is to

Two Mock Convention sessions
will be held later that day, at 1
p.m. and 8 p.m., and the final

Hudson death inquiry

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

The traffic accident that
resulted in the April death of a
Washington and Lee student is
still under investigation by the
Pensacola, Fla., police depart-
ment.

John Buddin, a_ traffic
homicide investigator for the
department, said his investiga-
tion was taking longer than
originally planned but that he
expected to be finished in about
10 days.

Ruben Ray Hudson Jr., who
was a junior at Washington and
Lee, died April 14 following an

number of area civic organiza-
tions, including the Roanoke
Shriners

The 95-piece Virginia Tech
Regimental Band heads the line-
up of marching bands — which
includes eight additional local
high school units.

“Unlike past years, we really
stressed the importance of hav-
ing a number of marching bands
participate. We have tried to
break up the monotony which
can come with viewing over 50
floats in a row,’ explained
Thompson.

Thompson and Perkins were
still attempting to book a Coors

April 12 accident in which the
car he was riding in hit a stalled
car on the side of the road.

Senior Duncan Stone of Pen-
sacola was driving the car at the
time of the accident, and another
Washington and Lee student,
Sophomore J. Jackson Willett,
also was riding in it.

“Our investigation...is becom-
ing quite lengthy,”’ Buddin said.
“Anytime we have a death,
we’re more thorough.”

Buddin, who termed the inci-
dent ‘‘a freak accident,”’ said he
had to talk to several more
witnesses who had cdéme into
contact with the three students

White aids police in arrest

Student body vice president-
elect James A. White assisted
Lexington police Saturday in de-
taining a man suspected of at-
tempting to sell drugs near the
Phi Delta Theta fraternity
house.

White said he was outside the
house when the man approached
him and after a brief conversa-
tion offered to sell him eight
pounds of sensimillion..

After White had told the man
he had a friend who might be in-
terested, he went inside and call-
ed police. Sgt. Wayne Straub ar-
rived in plain clothes and at-
tempted to make the purchcase,
but the man had apparently be-
come suspicious and withdrew
the offer.

At the scene of the attempted

sale, officer S. H. Cash found a
medicine vial filled with a
substance that field tested as
marijuana.

After being held briefly at the
Lexington police station, the
man, a Lynchburg resident, was
transported to Blacksburg,
where four warrants were
outstanding against him.

Lexington Police Chief L.O.
Sutton said that a search of the
man’s car revealed that he had
actually been attempting to sell
an eight-pound, brown bag filled
with leaves and trash.

“Fraternities are taking such
a bad rap for drugs and other

and Sweet Things.

Now that the hard part’s over,
here’s a review of two spring
treats: Westmoreland and Sweet
Things. Westmoreland, because
it’s open after being closed all
winter, and Sweet Things,
because ice-cream-eating
weather is finally upon us.

Westmoreland is arrived at by
getting on Route 11, and going
approximately 15 miles south,
all the while looking to your left.

Most people that have been to
Westmoreland, or go there

regularly, do so only on Sunday
nights, though keep in mind that
it’s open every day.
Westmoreland is synonomous
with fried chicken, and for good
reason. For $4.50 you get a buffet

Entertainment

with all the fried chicken, ham,
green beans, assorted salads,
vegetables and pies you can eat.
Their fried chicken, though not
the perfect fried chicken that I
described earlier in the year, is
better than any that can be got in
Lexington. Because it’s all you
can eat, they don’t worry about
making the pieces too big.
Rather, they cut their chicken in
a seemingly random manner,
which makes for often huge, odd-
ly shaped pieces, thus adding to
the attraction. More important-
ly, the chicken is very crunchy
and not overly greasy. Though it
could be a tad spicier, and the
meat a little sweeter, these are
just minor, almost inconsequen-
tial complaints.

Also, the vegetables and
salads are fresh and delicious.
The green beans were especially
good. If there’s any room left in
your stomach, or if you're
bulimic, the pies are homemade
and taste it. I loved their pecan
pie and heard similar sen-
timents from the apple pie and
blueberry pie eaters at the table.
And Westmoreland is clean,
quiet and relaxing, yet with a
gluttonous, all-you-can-eat at-
mosphere that is reassuring. But
take your time, chew your food
and go home and crash in front

of the tube. :
Next on the line-up of spring

treats is Sweet Things, the loca-
tion of which you surely already
know. Though Sweet Things
stays open year-round, and
though ice cream theoretically
tastes the same in the winter as
it does in the summer, it takes on
special significance in the
sweating season. I'll bet that
people wearing T-shirts and lick-
ing on an ice-cream cone are

Campus Corner Records

more vulnerable to all that is
sentimental and mushy than
they are at other more regular
moments. I just finished mine,
so I’ll stop, but you know what I
mean when saying that ice
cream is special.

Let it be said that Sweet
Things offers more than just the
aura of ice cream. They make
their own ice cream, which
allows them to experiment with
any ingredient that sounds like it
would make for good ice cream.
Owners and founders Roger and
Barbara Koehler say they’ve
made about 70 different flavors
so far.

Their most popular experi-
ment to date is the Oreo-flavored
cookie ice cream, which is by far
the best seller. It’s especially
good in milk shakes, as the bits
of Oreo add that delicious sog-
giness of dipped-in-milk cookies
to the already fantastic milk
shake concept. Some of the
flavors are downright _ intri-

guing. For instance, strawberry
cheesecake, which is brand new.
It took a second Phi-bought cone
for me to be sure that I could go
ahead and recommend it.

In another perilous investiga-
tion, a butterscotch Sundae with
Heath pieces was consumed and
also enjoyed.

Evidently, people are flocking
to Sweet Things, and don’t need
much prodding. Barbara said
that between last Tuesday,
which was ugly, and the next
day, when it started getting pret-
ty, they sold 3 times more ice
cream, and have not slacked up.

In the obituaries this week is
The Ranch, which closed the
doors for good recently. Let it be
said that a good salad, a decent
steak and a hot potato could be
had there. One less option.

In the In-with-the-new depart-
ment, Spanky’s now delivers,
thus saving capitalism from an
embarrassing week.

‘Nine’ gains semis in ODACs

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
baseball team advanced to the
finals of the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference tournament
with a 1-0 extra-inning victory
over Eastern Mennonite College
in Harrisonburg yesterday.

The win was the Generals’
first ever in ODAC tournament
play.

The game featured two of the
ODAC’s premier pitchers in
W&L’s Billy White and EMC’s
Doug Byler. Both pitchers turn-
ed in excellent performances as
White gave up only four hits, no
runs and had five strikeouts and
Byler allowed only five hits and
struck out 15 General batters.

The two teams battled through
nine scoreless innings with
neither team mounting a serious
scoring threat. In the tenth inn-
ing, W&L co-captain Mike Walsh
singled to left field and advanced
to third on Kevin Golden’s
sacrifice bunt and a throwing er-

ror. Walsh was tagged out at
home plate after an unsuccessful
suicide squeeze bunt attempt.

In the eleventh inning,
freshman rightfielder Adam
Yanez tripled off the right field
wall and scored when Milam
Turner reached on an error, giv-
ing the Generals a 1-0 lead.

The Royals gave the Generals
a scare in their half of the
eleventh. White gave a single
and was relieved by righthander
Peter Detlefs. Detlefs walked
the first batter he faced but then
got the Royal batter to hit into a
game-ending double play.
Detlefs earned his second save
of the season in the game.

Golden led the Generals with
two hits.

‘This was our best game of the
year defensively,’ W&L head
coach Jim Murdock said. ‘‘Of-
fensively, we had trouble but we
were facing a very good pitcher.
We were patient at the plate. We

ends lax skid

By JOHN HARRISON
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
lacrosse team blanked Roanoke
College for 37 minutes, starting
late in the first quarter, and
relied on the offense of Lee
Heimert and Rod Santomassimo
to score an 8-5 victory over the
Maroons in Salem yesterday.
The victory halted a three-game
losing skid and raised the
General’s record to 5-8. The
Maroons, ranked fifth in Divi-
sion III, dropped to 6-6.

The game marked the rever-
sal of a trend during losses to
Denison, UMBC and Saturday
against Washington, in which
W&L controlled or was even in
every statistic except the one on
the scoreboard. Yesterday, the
Generals were outshot 32-20 but
connected on a remarkably high
40 percent. Roanoke goalie Billy
Pilat had ‘only four Saves.

Coach Dennis Daly spoke
about the irony in the statistics
before yesterday's game. ‘‘Sta-
tistics are supposed to be for
losers, and we’ve been winning
face-offs, ground balls and shots
in the last three games (not in-
cluding Roanoke). We’ve been
taking plenty of shots but we
haven’t been finishing them off.
The scores certainly haven’t in-
dicated how far we’ve outshot
our opponents.”’

Maroon attackman Chris
Richardson scored from Rocco
Guglielmo near the end of the
first quarter. It was Roanoke’s
last lead, 3-2, and marked the
beginning of the long dry spell.
Heimert accounted for both
W&L goals in the opening
quarter.

In the second quarter, Mike
McAlaine flipped in a pass from
Jeff Mason with 6:20 left to even
it at 3-3. Two minutes later,

knew what we had to do and we
just did it.”’

White (6-1) has put together a
string of 32 innnings without giv-
ing up an earned run. White’s
earned run average now stands
at a conference leading 1.14.

“Billy has done a tremendous
job,” said Murdock. ‘I think
that the other teams are begin-
ning to realize that he is the best

pitcher in the conference.’’

In other action last week, the
Generals defeated Catholic 3-1
as White pitched a three-hitter at
Smith Field.

W&L spotted Catholic a one-
run lead in the third inning but
bounced back to tie the game in
the bottom of the inning.

overwhelming 6-2, 6-2 victory
over Max Henderson of Lynch-
burg.

At the No. 1 position, team
captain Craig Cannon lost a very
close first set against Lynch-
burg’s Buzz Frey. Cannon was
unable to establish himseli in the
second set and lost the match by
a score of 7-6 (8-6), 6-1.

Cannon and Mize formed the
championship team No. 1
doubles as they defeated Lynch-
burg’s Frey and Jim Sargent
with an impressive 6-1, 6-3 score.

Cannon and Mize will repre-
sent W&L in singles and doubles
competition at the NCAA Divi-

Emory University in Atlanta,
beginning May 9.

Senior Jim Irwin and fresh-
man Randy Johns reached the
finals of No. 2 doubles, but lost to
Lynchburg’s Henderson and
Pete Moran, 7-6, 6-2.

Irwin also reached the finals of
No. 4 singles, but he lost 6-1, 6-1
in the final, experiencing the
same fate as many W&L final-
ists: losing to a player from
Lynchburg.

W&L’s Scott Adams reached
the finals at No. 3 singles before
losing. there to Lynchburg’s
Sargent, 6-3, 6-2.

Adams played a very tough,
long and exciting first round
match against the No. 3 player
from Randolph-Macon. After
winning the first set 7-6, Adams
faced eight second set points
against him, four conseoutive
points at two different times.

First, trailing his opponent 5-4
in the second set, Adams also
trailed in the game, 3-0. Adams
won four consecutive points to
break his opponents serve and
tie the set at 5-5.

Two games later, Adams tied
the set once again at 6-6 and forc-
ed his opponent into a tie-
breaker. Adams’ opponent led
the breaker 6-2 and needed only
one point to win the set. Playing
with consistent groundstrokes,
Adams won six points in a row to
take the tiebreaker and the
match, 7-6, 7-6.

The Generals concluded their

McHenry pleased with JV lacrosse team

By PAUL CLARK
Staff Reporter

We all know and hear about
the varsity lacrosse team at
Washington and Lee, but there is
a group of lacrosse players —
the junior varsity team — that
deserves mention. Displaying
what JV. head coach Bill
McHenry calls ‘‘a good attitude
and determination,’ the JV
Generals compiled a respectable
6-3 record this year.

“T would say that though we
were undefeated last year...we
probably had a much better
team this year.”

McHenry lists a sound, consis-
tent offense with striking power
as the team’s strong point.

 

   

‘Several players come to
mind as being outstanding. Joe
Democko, a freshman, had 14
goals and 23 assists for a total of
37 points, and he only played in
eight games,’ according to
McHenry. Instead of playing in
the ninth game, Joe was moved
up to varsity.

Other high point men included
Bill Garavente, with 24 total
points on 19 goals and 5 assists,
and Bob Calabretta, who scored
9 goals and 10 assists for 19
points. Calabretta, Democko
and Garavente are freshmen,
giving McHenry even higher ex-
pectations for next year.

‘I know we have some players
that can help and will be able to

for example, is a fine attack pro-
spect, but he was sidelined for
almost the entire season with a
shoulder injury. However, he
played in our last game and
scored five goals.”’

McHenry also was _ pleased

with several other members of —

the team. He cited Corky
Parkinson (7 goals, 1 assist),
Dave Seifert (4 goals, 4 assists),
Steve Giacobbe (5 goals, 1
assist), Dave Grogan (4 goals),
John Oliver (3 goals), and Chris
Sherlock (4 goals, 1 assist) as
having very good seasons.
McHenry also adds that several
defensemen had very good
seasons.

“TI would say that Vinny
Lamanna and John Poulton had
solid seasons, and our goalies
played well, too. Pete Vander-
meid played solidly until he was
sidelined with a shoulder injury.
John Church came down from
the varsity and played extreme-
ly well — he has a lot of poten-
tial.”

Looking back on the season,
McHenry seems very pleased.
The Generals played well and
though they lost three games,
they were by a total of only five
goals. In addition, the three
teams they lost to — Radford
(13-14), Boys Latin (10-11) and
Gilman (4-7) — are all teams

with exceptional talent.
One of the reasons for the

General’s success, said
McHenry, is the assistance he
has received both from the cap-
tains and from a couple of law
students.

“The tri-captains, Dave Ib-
beken, Chris Alevizatos, and
Jerry Biedronski have been very
solid and helpful to me. I feel
that with them, we have team
unity.”’

“Pete Leberman has been a

said. Also helping McHenry is a

Olympics’

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

..A few belated thoughts on
the baseball Commissioner-
elect, Peter Ueberroth. Not to
discount Bowie, (Lord knows, he
tried to be a dominant force in
the game, but there’s just
something about the man that
makes him akin to a pain that
pills can’t reach) but Mr. Ueber-
roth is the man for the job. His
wonders with the L.A. Olympics
have yet to fully manifest
themselves, but, believe me,
they will. The man has run an
extremely tight ship as this
year’s Summer Olympics coor-
dinator, and there’s never been
any doubt who was in charge.
Because of this ability, Ueber-
roth’s Olympics should not be
one of those overbudgeted finan-
cial disasters that we’ve seen
past Olympic shows become.
Ueberroth is also an efficient
worker, an “‘I’ll get things done
no matter what it takes’’ type.
Witness the recent fiasco with
the Russians and their ques-
tionable attache. Ueberroth took
charge of the situation and
things now appear stable. Again,
there was no doubt who the main
man was. Ueberroth is one not
afraid of stepping — or stomping
— on a few toes. And what’s
more, Ueberroth is a man who’s
earned the respect as an ad-
ministrator and director that
will allow him to take control of
the league. Major league
baseball needs someone to take
charge, not merely a bloke who
makes an attempt to assert
some authority. Peter Ueberroth
is that man. Oh George, the new
commissioner’s not afraid of you
anymore....

....Congratulations are in
order for Coach Norris Aldridge
and his track and field group for
their ODAC title and Aldridge’s
Coach-of-the-Year honors (sec-
ond time this year). As I said
last week, this championship is
just reward for this team of top-
notchers...A tip of the cap to

again selected as the Coach-of-
the-Year.

W&L won by gaining a score of
141 points. Emory and Henry

As they have done all year, the

their team depth as they scored
in 16 of the-17 events. Along with
the championship, W&L also
captured one ODAC record, two

that NBA playoff situation. In

the stuff of playoff veterans by

One thing has stayed the same,
though: L.A. is the Martina

“Once again, it was a great
team effort. We were down after
the first day, but our athletes
hung in there and gave their best
efforts,” said Aldridge.

W&L got winning perfor-

who broke the ODAC record in
the 1,500 meters (3:58.7) and
also won the 5,000 meters

may be: With Ewing et al. not in

upped his price tag. I cannot
deny the mixture of sports,
money and business but I can
say that when the athletes begin
seeing themselves as mere pro-
ducts and their guiding concern
becomes their market value,
like so many head of cattle, I
wonder if we’ve gone a bit over
the limit of common sense...

In addition, W&L had three

en route to the victory.

“This may not have been my

have to say it is my best,’’ said
Aldridge, who has coached the

“We finished our regular

Tim Rock

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee’s All-
American swimmer Tim Rock
outlasted a grueling course to
win W&L’s first triathlon in less
than an hour and a half Sunday.

Anne Edmunds, a 1982 Sweet
Briar graduate, was the first
woman to finish and was third
overall. Assistant proctor Burr
Datz was first among five facul-
ty members and seventh overall.

Athletic Director William
McHenry, 51, came in fourth
among faculty and 20th overall.

The triathlon began at 9 a.m.
for the first heat and 10 a.m. for
the second. The athletes had to
swim 60 lengths in Warner
Center’s Cy Twombly Pool, bicy-
cle 13.1 miles on nearby roads
and run 3.1 miles cross country.

Rock said the course was
“unusually tough,” with hills in
strategic places and plenty of
mud to run through.

“You could tell that (Coach
Norm) Lord made up _ the
course,”’ he said.

After becoming a Division III
All-American in the 1,650
freestyle, Rock said, he trained
by concentrating on the running
and biking portions of the race.
He said he ran four miles a day
and biked 10 miles every other

day to train.
Rock’s winning time of
1:29:19.9 “will be tough to

break,”’ triathlon director Tim
McDonald said.

He called the event a great
success, since it went off without
a hitch and no injuries were
reported.

He said he expected the
triathlon to become an annual
event, although he hopes some-
one else will direct it.

checking the ball away from
Willie Banassi. Shortly after-
ward, Roanoke was called for
pushing. Santomassimo  con-
verted on the extra-man attack
for a 5-3 advantage going into the
fourth quarter.

Heimert’s fourth unassisted
goal made it 6-3 with 11 minutes
left in the game. But Robbie
Black and Guglielmo, who used
a double screen, tallied to close
the lead to 6-5. DiDuro protected
the lead with two big saves.

John then put Santomassimo
in the clear with a long pass and
Santomassimo made the most of
a one-on-one situation to make it
7-5. Santomassimo’s second
extra-man goal, and third over
all, completed the scoring with
38 seconds left. W&L has now
beaten the Maroons five straight
times since 1979.

Saturday, the Generals lost for

with 4:27 left in the third quarter
when Dan Ducar spun off Tim

DiDuro’s stick. Taylor Walker
via Gaines made it 7-3 after
three.

W&L got as close as 95 ona

and Steve McGrath’s pass from

off the stick of goalie Greg

Dear—

(continued from page 1)

Green said White ‘‘hit me in
the stomach, grabbed me by the
lapels as if he were trying to pull
me out of the chair, and then
grabbed me by the ankles and
pulled me to the floor.”’

Jenevein, who would say for
the record only that there was ‘‘a
physical attack’’ and ‘“‘at least
one form oi a violent strike,”
recalled that White said to
Green, ‘‘Don’t f--k. with me,
Green. I'll kill you; I'll kill you.”

“If you call grabbing Green by
the ankles and pulling him out of
the chair a ‘physical attack,’
then I guess I’m guilty,’’ White
said. ‘“‘The most he can Say is
that he had a few minutes of
discomfort. People fall out of
chairs all the time.”’

“Immediately, I knew two
things,” he said. ‘I knew I could
hurt him severely, and that I
shouldn’t have done it.”’

In response to a question,
White said, ‘‘No, it wash’t done
playfully.”

Jenevein called the alleged at-
tack ‘‘unprovoked’’ and Green
said it was ‘‘without question
totally unprovoked.”’

“From my vantage point, I
thought it was provoked,’’ White
said. ‘‘It was a heated discussion
and I had a real problem with
Jenevein’s and Green’s actions
at that point.”

“It’s an indication of the fact
that they’re both crybabies and
needed something to complain
about,”’ he continued. ‘‘I think to
characterize it as an unprovoked
attack is mere rhetoric.”’

Green said that after the alter-
cation, White went outside, and
later came in and said, “I
apologize if I touched you. If I
hurt your clothes, I will pay to
have them cleaned. That is all
I’m going to apologize to.”’

The two EC members said
they wrote the letters to Dean
John based on notes and dia-
grams which they made in-
dependently immediately after
the incident.

Jenevein related the incident
to President John D. Wilson in a
meeting the day after the honor
trial. “I am completely unsure
of what he has done or what he
plans to do,” Jenevein said.

‘I’m under the impression the
administration is dealing with
it,”’ he said. ‘‘I can’t claim to be
completely objective in my re-.

“They may be going a little

further in this case to look for a
reason,’”’ he said.

Wanger cited a broken neck as
the cause of death.

J.O. Robinson, the state
trooper who was the first at the
accident scene, said immediate-
ly after the jncident that the
medical examiner’s office ‘‘was
not happy” with the circum-
stances of the death. Ritenour
said that foul play was being
considered in the investigation.

Although Friend was taking
medication for a colon disorder,
Wanger said that the drugs
would not have had a significant
effect on Friend.

counting of the events, so I’ll
leave the determination of fault
with the proper authorities.”’

White has served as_ the
school’s director of minority af-
fairs since 1979, and so is listed
as one of the ‘‘administrative of-
ficers’’ of Washington and Lee.
In addition, he is a second year
law student.

The ‘White Book” on the
Honor System specifies that
“the advisers must be members
of the Washington and Lee stu-
dent body.”’

“If they want to take me in to
Student Control, then so be it,”’
White said. ‘‘If they’re trying to
link it up to my administrative
capacity, I think personally
that’s a little cheap.”’

“*My problem is that under the
White Book, I could only defend

determine why Friend was in
Keysville that night. Tony War-
ren, a longtime friend and
classmate of Friend’s since high
school, said that Hampden-
Sydney students occasionally
ate at a restaurant there.
Ritenour said that students had
told him that Friend was ‘‘an
avid turkey hunter” and that he
may have been in the area sear-
ching for hunting locations.
Hampden-Sydney Dean of
Students Lewis Drew said that
he had met with 15 students in-
dividually to try to reconstruct
Friend’s activities that day. He
said that despite these meetings,

larger group meetings and
several conferences’ with
Friend’s parents, the cir-

cumstances of the day are still
unclear.

 

[the accused] as a student....
Anything I did in that connection
— good, bad or indifferent —
would be as a student,’’ White
continued. “Otherwise, [the ac-
cused]’s trial is null and void
and he should be called back and
retried with an appropriate
counsel.”’

“T think it was a violation of
the spirit of the Honor System
for White to serve as an ad-
vocate,’’ Jenevein said.

“I’m sure that when the re-
quirement that students serve as
advocates was drafted, they
didn’t anticipate an ad-
ministrator serving in a dual
role,’’ he added. ‘‘John White is
a member of the administration
—period. I don’t think we can
overlook that in evaluating his
actions.”’

 

“We are trying to get all the in-
formation we can to get a com-
plete picture,” Drew said. ‘So
far the investigation is still in-
complete.”’

Friend left home the morning
of the accident about 9 a.m. but
did not attend classes, according
to Drew. One student at first
thought he saw Friend in the
library around 11 a.m. but later
said he was unsure, Drew said.

Friend stopped at a Chase City
gas station at 6 p.m. and was not
seen again until he was killed at
7:45 p.m.

Friend was a member of the
Kappa Sigma fraternity, but
Drew is adamant that his death
was not related to the fraternity.

‘There is absolutely no frater-
nity connection whatsoever,’’ he
said.

 

 

 

 

 

“It is very hard for him not to
be viewed as an administrator,”’
Green said. ‘‘You can’t hide one
capacity.”’

“Tl am caught,”’ White said in
an earlier interview. ‘‘I thought I
was defending [the accused] as
a student. I can see now that
what I did or might have done
could have implications on my
position here at the school.”’

“I can say in my own defense
that I would not do anything to
undermine the Honor System,”
he said. ‘‘To me it was a matter
of ethics and consciousness pure
and simple — the principle that
everyone is entitled to a
defense.”’

member. The vote was 10-2.

A proposal to allow the accus-
ed to make an opening statement
in the closed hearing was re-
jected also by an 8-1 vote with
two abstentions.

Judge said that the accused
would probably use the opening
statement to say the same things
he now can ‘say in the closing
statement.

The EC also approved a revi-
sion that will allow the EC to
select one member of the student
body to help try open honor
trials. At present, both members
of the prosecuting team in the
open honor trial must be EC
members.

“At least we’ll have the option
of getting a law student,’’ said
Judge’ ‘‘I think the student body
will support this,’’ he concluded.

Washington and Lee University

Lexington, Virginia

May 10, 1984

 

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

The number of guilty votes
needed to convict a defendant in
a public honor trial will be
reduced from eight to five if a
motion given initial approval by
the Executive Committee Tues-
day night is confirmed next
Tuesday.
The proposal was introduced
by Student Body President Bob
Jenevein, who expressed con-
cern that there is a lack of stu-
dent faith in the EC’s closed
honor hearing verdicts.
“Basically, our decision (in
the closed hearing) means
nothing if it goes to appeal,”
sophomore representative
James White said.
Three of the four students who
have appealed their cases to a
student body jury this year have
had their closed hearing convic-
tions overturned.
A second resolution passed in-
volves adding the word ‘‘Expel-
led’ to the transcript of a stu-
dent convicted in a public hear-
ing. Jenevein said that would
reduce the number of appeals of
closed hearing convictions
because a convicted student
might not want to risk having the
notation on his transcript.

But junior representative Bob
Tomaso objected that passing

 

EC proposes reducing
votes for conviction

both resolutions would be ‘‘a
step too far.”’

AS a compromise, a friendly
amendment was passed saying
that if the first resolution is con-
firmed Tuesday, when the EC is
required to vote on all White
Book revisions a second and
final time, the second resolution
would be dropped.

Jenevein began discussion of
the first proposal by reading a
letter from a faculty member
who was involved in an honor
trial this year.

“As the system now func-
tions,” the letter said, ‘‘a deci-
sion reached by these specially
chosen representatives (the EC)
can be reviewed and overturned
by a student jury randomly
selected. Indeed,... a mere five
members of a random jury can
overturn a conviction. Such an
arrangement is patently ab-
surd.”’

“T think ... you would do well to
treat an appeal from an EC judg-
ment not as a fresh start with the
burden of proof once again on
the prosecution. Rather, if you
wish to operate out of a random-
ly chosen review panel, require
that the appellant convince a
majority of the panelists that in-
justice has been done.”’

Noting that individual EC
members had previously dis-
cussed the difficulty of getting

   

BOB JENEVEIN

...introduced open trial change
convictions in open trials, Jene-
vein said he strongly supported
the faculty member’s letter.

But junior representative and
President-elect Cole Dawson ex-
pressed a concern that a future
EC might become frustrated by
a lack of convictions and just
start “looking to kick someone
out.”

Senior representative George
Youmans disagreed, saying, ‘‘I
think it’s presumptuous to think
that an EC will ever be out to get
someone.’

The motion, which will put the
burden of getting a two-thirds
majority vote of the 12 jurors on
the defendant rather than on the
EC in public trials, was passed
7-1, with Secretary Jim Messer
against and Dawson abstaining.

The EC will meet again Tues-
day night for the final votes on

Alumni respond to coed poll

By JOHN CLEGHORN

Chief Editor

Approximately 40 percent of Washington and
Lee’s 16,500 current alumni have responded to an
extensive questionnaire on whether W&L should ad
mit women to its undergraduate program, accol
ding to Farris Hotchkiss, director of University

development and relations.

The results of the 117-question poll, which was
sent to all alumni in February, are being analyzed
by Southeastern Institute of Research in Richmond,
Va. and will first be released to the W&L Board of
Trustees at its May 25-26 meeting.

Questions on the poll cover general attitudes
about W&L, the University’s current academic
reputation, its size and traditions, and how coeduca-
tion would effect those elements of the school in the

opinions of the alumni.

‘It’s not a simple yes or no poll,’’ said Hotchkiss

ed.”’
Hotchkiss said

“It is a considerable amount of work.”

“I imagine what we'll find is that there are all
kinds of answers to coeducation,” he said. ‘‘The
survey is going to tell us a lot more about what our
alumni aspire to as far as this university is concern-

that some of the ‘traw, uninter-

New party rules

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

A set of guidelines for the pro-
posed student activities center,
including a clause limiting the
number of weekend parties that
can be held in each fraternity
house per term, will be
presented to the Board of
Trustees at its meeting in two
weeks.

“No more than four weekend
parties per term may be held in
any one house, with possible ex-
ceptions for Rush and Fancy
Dress,” the third section of the
guidelines states, although
fraternities co-sponsoring par-
ties at each other’s houses will
have an opportunity for more
parties.

Another section states that
‘*Tuesday Nights in the Pit’ will
be moved to Wednesday nights,
with Wednesday night fraternity
parties limited to members and
their dates.

Admitting that some of the
changes are ‘‘pretty drastic,”

i SAC to issue decision on changes

Student Body President Bob
Jenevein, who helped draw up
the plan with the Student Ac-
tivities Board and the Inter-
fraternity Council, said Tuesday
that the plan does not limit
fraternities as much as it seems.

‘In a 12-week term two houses
can get together and have eight
parties in their houses,’ Jene-
vein said, ‘‘and they still haven’t
partied out at the pavilion.”

SAB Treasurer John Haywood
said that the plan, passed by the
Student Affairs Committee two
weeks ago, will still allow frater-
nities to have parties every
weekend.

The pavilion, which is ex-
pected to cost over $500,000 and
to be built by October, still needs
final approval by the board.

“The idea behind (the guide-
lines) is to reduce the wear and
tear on the fraternities,’ Dean
Dan N. Murphy, an SAC
member, said, ‘‘which is ob-
viously a result of the very large
parties that sometimes take
place at fraternities now.”

Officials investigating the fire
which destroyed the Phi Gamma
Delta fraternity house met into
the early afternoon today
without announcing a decision
on the cause of the blaze.

The investigation into the
cause and origin of the fire is in
its final stages and an announce-
ment is expected shortly. Addi-

materials from the house were
conducted early this week.

The three-story house was gut-

Review and Outlook

 

 

Patently Absurd

Four students convicted of honor violations this
year have appealed their convictions to student body
juries. Three of these students’ convictions have been
overturned by the student jurors.

The purpose of the public appeal is to prevent the
Executive Committee from becoming an omnipotent
body. A student convicted of an honor violation by the
EC has a chance to seek justice if he feels he has been
wronged.

Students must not abuse their right to public honor
hearings — a student should appeal his EC conviction
only if he knows he has not committed an honor viola-
tion.

Recognizing the problem of an abundance of open
trials, the EC took steps to correct it — to guard
against continued misuse of the public trial — in its
White Book Revisions hearings this week. Formerly,
eight of the 12 student jurors had to vote guilty for a
student to be convicted. Responding to a letter from a
faculty member that called that process ‘‘patently ab-
surd,’’ the EC passed a revision lowering the number
of student jurors to five who must vote guilty for the
student to be convicted.

Although we understand the frustration the EC
must feel at consistently having its convictions over-
turned by a student body jury, we feel this move was a
step too far in the other direction. Under the proposed
change, a majority of student jurors could vote inno-
cent, and the student would he found guilty.

There are other ways of altering fhe public honor
trial proceedings so as to make appeals less attrac-
tive. Lowering the number of votes needed to convict
to less than a majority of the jurors is not a sensible
solution. Above all, our honor system should be fair to
both student and EC.

If this proposal receives final approval next week, it
would not be so.

Mommy, we’re big boys now

To the Editors:

I never try to get involved in
anything I don’t know about, but
after looking at the asinine Rush
proposal, I must protest. Being a
freshman and just recently hav-
ing gone through Rush, I laugh-
ed scornfully at the proposal
passed by the out-of-touch UC. I
didn’t know I was a student at
Washington and Lee High
School; someone told me it was
college.

The administration’s infringe-
ments upon my private life can
no longer be tolerated. I quote
the proposal: ‘The Student Af-
fairs Committee agrees that the
nature of Rush should be chang-
ed to put less emphasis on
amplified music (get a load of
that term) and alcoholic
beverages (let’s protect those
freshmen; they’ve probably
never had beer) and should be
shortened to lessen the distrac-
tion from the academic charac-
ter of life at W&L in the opening
weeks of fall term.”’

Oh yes, I agree with the ad-
ministration; I think we should
tell the freshmen that frater-
nities are really just study
groups and keep all real views of
fraternities from their naive
eyes. Concerning the shortened
Rush, I also agree. We should
hurry up their decision. After
all, they’re only making a deci-
sion which will affect the next
four years of their lives. Turning
in homework that first week is
by far more important (if we
make the assumption at all that
during Rush a freshman would
not do his required work). Fur-
thermore, the proposal makes
Rush dry, except for two beer
parties on only two nights — dry
of girls and beer. Only on these
two nights are bands permitted,
however, one of these nights
happens to fall the night after
bids are to be accepted (a fast
one on the SAC’s part). To go on,
Rush orientation and registra-
tion is scheduled for the first day
of Rush. How are the poor, inno-

cent freshmen to decide which
houses to sign up for if they
haven’t had a good week to
select several houses to return
to?

The Rush proposal is just the
tip of the iceberg as far as the
“Mommy” administration is go-
ing to restrict our social lives.
Next year, “Tuesday Nights in
the Pit” are no more; they’ve
been moved to Wednesday night
(I wonder which fraternal
engagements are the target of
this slick move — yes, Wednes-
day night parties! If and when
Wednesday night parties occur,
they are to be limited to “frater-
nity members only”’ and are also
to be “‘chip-in” parties).

Oh yes, let’s not forget about
restrictions on fraternity parties

in general. ‘‘Mommy’’ had
decided for us that fraternities
are to only be allowed four
weekend parties per semester.
Sounds like fun, doesn’t it?

It is absolutely ludicrous for
this maternal administration to
be making such drastic changes
in the social life at W&L. I am
here to make my own decisions
such as whether I will drink on a
school night or whether I will do
my schoolwork. It is none of the
administration’s business to in-
terfere with my private life, or
that of any other student’s at this
school. It is for this reason that I
chastize the moves being made
against the social life at W&L by
the administration.

Student is shocked

by White

To the Editors:

I was shocked after reading
the article in the May 3 Phi
describing Dean John White’s
behavior at last week’s ‘‘pre-
trial conference.” Pulling a per-
son out of a chair by the ankles is
indicative of a second-grade stu-
dent, but a second-year law stu-
dent? Please. The ability to
react rationally in a ‘‘heated
discussion” would seem essen-
tial for an aspiring lawyer. I do
not feel that death threats reflect
rational behavior. Mr. White
continued to dine on his own foot
as he branded the President of
our Student Body and captain of
our football team a “‘crybaby”
who “‘needed something to com-
plain about.”” Why should Mr.
Jenevein need to complain? The
EC’s decision was _ upheld!
Assuming that Mr. White is still
intent on pursuing a career in
law, I suggest that he review the
basic elements of common

’s actions

courtesy before entering a court-

room. After all, contempt there

may result in more serious con-
sequences.

Low Ball turnout
leads to SABU loss

By JOHN WINTERS
Special to the Phi

After planning for a crowd of
over 1,100 and spending more
than $10,000 preparing for the
13th Annual SABU Ball, the W&L
Student Association for Black
Unity was stung financially
Saturday night when only about
300 people attended.

SABU officials are blaming
the timing of the ball for the poor
attendance. The loss has been
estimated to be between $5,000
and $8,000.

Ron Magee, past president of
SABU, felt the main problem
was student apathy, especially
in regard to the conflict with the
Spring Weekend. “I got a few
remarks that because of the con-
flict with Spring Weekend, peo-
ple were upset and not coming,”
he remarked.

Magee stated that SABU had
‘“‘made an honest attempt to pro-
vide a good time for the W&L
community and to make it more
accessible to everyone.’’ Yet it
turns out that by trying to give
everyone a chance to par-
ticipate, SABU was financially
hurt. One of the main reasons for
moving the ball to the spring
term was so that students would
not have to shell out more money
so soon after Fancy Dress,
Magee said. The usual date for
the ball is in late March.

Attendance for the ball was
approximately 200 fewer than
usual, according to Magee. The
reason for this was in the late
date, he said. Many people from
surrounding schools in Roanoke,
Lynchburg and the area
women’s colleges attend. Yet
due to the late date, Magee said
many of the schools were either
in exams or, as in the case of
James Madison University, out
of school.

The lower attendance had a
profound effect upon the finan-
cial status of SABU. D Train
alone cost $7,000 while Lite Year
added another $700, according to
Dean of Minority affairs John L.
White. Added to this were the
costs for food, security, and ren-
tal tables. Cleanup and the set-
ting up and break down of the
band’s equipment were all done
by the students themselves,
White said.

SABU was alloted $1,500 by the
EC in September, and Magee
said that the EC refused in April

to grant SABU additional funds.

White said, ‘‘We didn’t lose any

Red Front

money, but we didn’t have
enough to give a substantial gift
to the Poindexter Fund.” This
fund is in memory of Marjorie
Poindexter, a secretary for over
15 years here who recently died
while at work. She handled the
affairs for the minority students
before a dean was selected to
handle it. The fund -is an
emergency loan for students
with urgent need.

When questioned further about
where the additional funds to
pay for all the expenses came
from, Dean White responded,
“‘Jet’s just say that all the bills
were paid,’’ he said. Magee was
more open and admitted that
they had to use funds from the
SABU budget. He added that, ‘‘I
do not believe that we are in the
black, we took a beating and it
will have repercussions on our
future activities.”

Overall both men felt that
despite the poor turnout, every-
one there had an excellent time.
Magee felt that ‘‘on May 5,
SABU put on the best show found
anywhere in the area.’ White
furthered that line by stating:
“The bottom line is that it was
an outstanding show and I wish
more people could have seen it,
but it didn’t slow down D Train
or the people there.”

By MARKHAM S. PYLE
Phi Columnist

Tomorrow night, there will be
considerable debate on the plat-
form of the Mock Democratic
Convention. The platform, this
time around, really does reflect
as best it might the views com-
mon to the National Democratic
Party. Tuesday, President

My View

Reagan spoke to the Council of
the Americas on Central
American Affairs. On Saturday
— Cinco de Mayo — there were
the Democratic caucuses in Tex-
as.

All of these have a common
note. They have a lot to do with
some modern confusions. The
confusion between freedom and
democracy. The confusion be-
tween hierarchy and tyranny.
The confusion, most of all, be-
tween liberty and license.

The president has little choice
but to employ the most common
terms of political discourse. He
could hardly do otherwise than
accept the present situation in
which freedom, secured to the

 

United States by their careful

“Opinion

Clearing up the confusion

avoidance of untrammelled
democracy, by their commit-
ment to republican constitu-
tionalism, is actually spoken of
as something dependent on
democratic voting procedure.
But the persistence of this confu-
sion can only debase_ the
language and tangle thought.

Certainly, my own party, the
Democratic party, has, on the
national level, fallen prey to this
confusion. As reflected in our
own Mock Convention platform,
the prevailing attitudes of the
elite which has captured and
which controls the national par-
ty are best characterized as
“‘unidea’d leftism.’”’ By some
curious alchemy, a commitment
to The People has become
transmuted to a program of
legislation directed toward
nothing so much as the reduction
of popular liberty: the expansion
of the state, in the people’s name
at the people’s expense.

The Texas Democratic Party
does things differently.We are
committed to the caucus system.
Those who feel that freedom on-
ly exists in democracy will ob-
ject that the caucus is inferior to
the primary, that it is a vile

_mechanism for the stifling of the

popular will.
In fact, the caucus structure
back home is anything but an

oligarchic despotism. Party
members who vote in the pri-
mary for local and statewide of;
fices are credentialled to their
precinct caucuses. The caucus
endorsement is based on ‘the
sense of the meeting.’

Now this, it seems to me, is a
vindication of the principle of
‘natural aristocracy.’ Before I
am drawn and quartered, let me
explain. That tart, prim
Calvinist John Adams best defin-
ed ‘natural aristocracy’ in a let-
ter ta Josiah Quincy—the
natural aristocrat is that man
who can control two votes: his
own and another’s. His principle
of hierarchy is natural to men,
and politicians ignore it at their
peril. Indeed, it is proper that
this principle be obeyed. It is the
process of ensuring that those
who are interested in a political
question are made aware of
their interest, the process
whereby the natural aristocrat
convinces his constituency of the
validity of his opinions, which
serves as a check upon the
tyranny of a majority opinion. It
forces deep consideration of
issues and public debate upon
them, and it preserves liberty
and diversity. Let us who are
concerned with liberty and

 

diversity preserve it.

 

Contact budgets to be cut in future

Speaker committee funding reduced in effort to fill $6,000 deficit.

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

Three thousand dollars will be
deducted from Contact’s budget
in both 1984-85 and 1985-86 to help
eliminate a deficit of $6,000 that
had built up over a period of
several years.

The deficit cutting measure
was approved 9-1 by the Ex-
ecutive Committee last week.-

Contact, an ~ organization
designed to bring speakers to
campus, is funded by student
taxes, individual contributions
and a contribution from the In-
terfraternity Council.

The deficit was not discovered
until March, when Contact co-
chairmen Marty Harmon and
Gov Slahor found out that the
organization has a deficit of
$15,000 accumulated in previous
years. The deficit went unnotic-

 

 

Rent A Kegtainer

  
   

ed because Contact’s records
showed the group had a $950
surplus in 1982-83, while Univer-
sity records showed the group
had a $10,000 deficit. In addition,
Contact had begun the 1982-1983
year with a deficit of nearly
$6,000, putting the total deficit at
$15,000 at the start of this year.

It was originally estimated
that $13,500 in additional funds
would be needed to eliminate
Contact’s deficit. A preliminary
proposal had called for $5,200 to
be cut from Contact’s budget in
1984-85 and $5,400 in 1985-86 as
part of a plan to retire the
deficit.

Junior EC representative Cole
Dawson said Contact’s deficit
actually was only $6,000. Dawson
reported that a $7,500 con-
tribution by the IFC to Contact in
April had not been figured into
the estimate of the deficit.

Dawson said that it was confu-
sion over an IFC contribution
last year that caused the deficit.
Last year the IFC made two
$7,500 contributions — one in
September and one in April —
because it had forgotten to pay
Contact the previous year. The
September contribution was
meant to be credited to Contact
‘*82,’’ explained Dawson.

Dawson said last year’s Con-
tact assumed that both contribu-
tions by the IFC were to be

credited to them. Consequently,
Contact spent more than $25,000
last year when actually they on-
ly had about $15,000 to spend,
Dawson said.

Slahor said he was satisfied
with the EC’s final plan.

“‘We had made a preliminary
arrangement. At the time the
cost to next year’s Contact was
much greater. The way it’s turn-
ed out, it’s much more scaled
down than originally,’ Slahor
added.

Slahor said he thought the ar-
rangement was fair to everyone.
He said he hoped next year’s
Contact would be able to work its
way around the $3,000 cut.

“It’s not going to hurt the pro-
gram too much. The program’s
back on course. Two years from
now it will be solvent,” Slahor
said.

Slahor said that one way next
year’s Contact could get around
the $3,000 deficit was by launch-
ing an extensive fund raising
drive aimed at parents and
alumni. Sponsoring one fewer
speaker or less-expensive
speakers are also possible solu-
tions to the problem, Slahor said.

“T think that it’s very possible
that with an active drive to the
parents and alumni it could be
made up,” Slahor said.

Contact could also split the
cost of a speaker with another

organization such as the Law
Forum, Slahor said. This year
Contact co-sponsored a speech
by Hugh Sidey with the Mock
Convention, Slahor pointed out.

Slahor said that most speakers
considered by Contact charged
between $2,000 and $8,000. Con-
tact’s most expensive speaker
this year was Malcolm Forbes,
who charged $8,000 including
travel fees.

Although Contact is in debt
from past years, Slahor said this
year’s Contact did not add to the
deficit.

‘We stayed within the budget.
We’re not in debt for our year,”’
he said.

A final budget report will be
submitted to the EC as soon as
possible, Slahor said. Contact
was supposed to report to the EC
Monday night, but did not. The

EC reprimanded Contact for its _

failure to report on time.

Slahor said Contact found out
about the deficit too late in the
year to cut back on this year’s
program in order to start reduc-
ing the deficit.

‘“‘When we found out about it,
we already owed money for
Hugh Sidey and Seymour
Hersh. And we were under con-
tract to Malcolm Forbes. We
paid off our debt of $5,000 and the
rest went to Forbes,’’ Slahor re-
ported.

UC passes dry, two-week Rush

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

The University Council gave
final approval last Thursday toa
dry, two-week Rush calendar for
September of the next school
year,

Interfraternity Council Presi-
dent David Perdue presented the
two-week calendar as a proposal
to the Student Affairs Commit-
tee, which passed it without ob-
jection and sent it to the UC,

which passed the proposal by a
10-6 vote.

The calendar is a compromise
of the Ad Hoc Committee on
Fraternity Affairs’ recommen-
dation of a one-week Rush and a
previous IFC proposal of a three-
week Rush that was rejected by
the SAC.

Next year’s Rush will begin
with Rush Orientation and
Registration on Tuesday, May 4,

tation begins.

Eight Open Houses are
scheduled for the first two days.
The first four Rush Dates will
take place Thursday and Friday
of that first week, with no bids to
be offered until the second week.

No contact will be allowed
after any Rush function during
the first week, including after
the fourth Rush Date Friday
night. Also, all Rush functions
are dry and limited to members
and freshmen only.

Alcohol can be served for the

_ first time Saturday night of the

first week, when one-band par-
ties are allowed.

The only functions scheduled
for Tuesday and Thursday of the
second week, the first week of
classes, are optional dinners at

the fraternity houses, with no
contact after 7 p.m.

Rush Dates five through eight
are scheduled for Monday and
Wednesday of the second week,
with bids being offered but no
contact allowed after 10 p.m.

Friday, September 14, will in-
clude dormitory Rush from 3-5
p.m. and Rush Dates nine and
10, after which Rush is officially
over, bids may be accepted, and
non-band parties are allowed.

One band parties are permit-
ted that Saturday night.
Preference cards are due Sep-
tember 17.

“IT think it will be short and
very intense,’’ Perdue said, ‘‘but
that’s what they want it to do as
far as getting the freshmen into
the academic aspect of school

earlier than the old Rush did.”

Dean of Students Lewis John,
a member of the SAC and UC,
said that by moving the start of
Rush back it did not impinge on
classes as much but still remain-
ed long enough to satisfy
everyone.

“There was some sentiment
expressed that the calendar was
too short,’’ John said of the UC
meeting.

Perdue said there was a dif-
ferent dissenting opinion in the
SAC meeting.

‘“‘A couple of them wanted to
see a little change (in the pro-
posal) but saw that we could use
this as a transition year, and
may'e we could cut it down even
further next year if we see the
need for it,’’ Perdue said.

Dederick to receive degree

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

A Washington and Lee student
convicted last fall on three drug-
related charges can receive his
diploma May 31, the faculty
decided Monday.

William Loren Dederick, who
was given a 12-year suspended
sentence and 10 years probation
for the sale of cocaine, posses-
sion of cocaine, and posession of
marijuana with intent to
manufacture, was suspended
from the university for this
academic year by the Student
Affairs Committee in October.

Dederick had completed his

requirements for graduation
when he was arrested a few days
before the commencement
ceremonies last May.

Sources within the faculty in-
dicated the vote was close Mon-
day.

Dean of Students Lewis G.
John, in a background letter to
faculty members, wrote, “‘Disci-
plinary cases are treated in-
dividually, and there is no
general university policy gov-
erning the disposition of student
cases which involve felony con-
victions.”’

Washington and Lee student con-
victed at the same time as

Dederick, was suspended for
three academic years. “In
Rorhig’s case, there was
evidence of numerous sales of
marijuana; for profit, over a
considerable period of time,”
John wrote.

While serving 90 days in jail
and awaiting completion of a
pre-sentence report last fall,
Dederick conducted research
and performed some r-
cheological work under the
supervision of W&L anthro-
pology Professor John
McDaniel.

A work-release program such.
as this must be approved by the
Rockbridge County Sheriff S.M.
Reynolds and Circuit Court
Judge George E. Honts III.
Honts gave his approval to the
plan Nov. 14.

Guidelines issued by the
sheriff’s office for work-release
programs read, ‘‘In order to
qualify, the inmate must first be
approved by the sheriff and the
court.”

“No drug related . . . inmates
will be considered for this pro-
gram.”

Reynolds said yesterday that
because Dederick was doing
work for the community and was
not earning any money, he did
not technically fall under those
guidelines. ‘“The judge let this go
because he was trying to rehabil-
itate these people,’’ Reynolds
added.

Honts said that when the
sheriff approves a work-release
program, he usually concurs.
“My position on work-release
from jails has been that so long
as the sheriff establishes
reasonable guidelines to ad-
minister the program, I'll go
along with his administrative
policies,’’ Honts said.

‘nis particular work-release
program was a little bit unusual,
Honts said, because Dederick
was supervised by both
McDaniel and by his attorney,
Thomas Spencer.

awards for his Times-Dispatch
column. He is a regular panelist
on the weekly public television
program Washington Week in

McDowell is a_ Lexington
native. He joined the staff of the
Times-Dispatch in 1949, after
earning the M.S. degree from
Columbia University’s graduate
school of journalism.

He became a regular colum-

nist for the Times-Dispatch in
1955 and Washington correspon-
dent for the paper in 1965. He has
covered each national political
convention since 1952.

W&L awarded McDowell an
honorary degree in 1975.

Reunion activities have been
planned for 11 W&L classes, in-
cluding the 50th reunion for the
Class of 1934.

Ethics program granted $75,000

Washington and Lee has
received a $75,000 grant from the
Arthur Vining Davis Founda-
tions of Jacksonville, Fla., to
assist in establishing an $800,000
endowment for the University’s
program in applied ethics,
“Society and the Professions.’

The $75,000 from the Davis
Foundations will complete a
challenge grant from the Na-

tional Endowment for the
Humanities. With the addition of
the Davis Foundations grant,
Washington and Lee has raised
$600,000 to meet the NEH
challenge and thereby qualify
for $200,000 from the NEH.

“With this generous gift, the
Arthur Vining Davis Founda-
tions have enabled us to meet
our challenge and to establish a

permanent endowment for one
of the most distinctive teaching
programs at Washington and
Lee,’’ W&L President John D.
Wilson said.

Wilson said the Campus Life

Campus Life committee, which
was created earlier this year, is
examining the potential effects
of coeducation on the athletic
program, the fraternity system,
the University residential life
and the University food services.

The Academic Affairs com-
mittee is examining the effects
on the “admissions office and
the quality of the applicant pool”’
as well as potential shifts in the
size of the undergraduate
academic departments, Wilson
said.

The Executive Committee,
which is made up of the subcom-
mittee chairmen, is studying the
‘‘intangibles”’ of the issue which
Wilson said include such sub-
jects as honor and tradition.

“The Executive Committee is
trying to figure out what the am-
bience of W&L is,” Wilson said.
‘That’s a different set of con-
siderations but a very important
set,’’

The Planning and Develop-
ment committee is handling the
questionnaire, Wilson said, and
is also trying to estimate the ef-
fect of coeducation on alumni
donations to the University.

Frank’s King of Pizza
passes the Beat’s inspection

By EDDIE CURRAN
Staff Reporter

If you like your pizza authen-
tic, and by that I mean made by
real Italians, then Frank’s King
of Pizza is the place for you — to
buy pizza. But while the pizza is
good, I recommend Frank’s for
other reasons, namely the sand-

The

Eat Beat

wiches, the calzones and the
very reasonable prices.

Frank’s has two kinds of piz-
za: the regular pizza, with the
regular crust, and the much
thicker-crusted Sicilian pizza. I
prefer the regular crust,
because I would rather fill
precious space with as high a
cheese-pepperoni-sausage-and-
tomato-sauce-to-bread ratio as
possible, but this is strictly a
matter of personal preference.
For those who like thicker crust,
Frank’s Sicilian pizza should
surely please. Despite its
thickness, it does have a crunchy
bottom, as well as a generous
supply of toppings.

The crust on the regular pizzas
is closer to the chewy of
Domino’s than to the crispiness
of Pizza Hut. As for ingredients,

Frank’s puts much more on than
the sparsely decorated Domi-
no’s, and more than Pizza Hut as
well. If I have one specific
“beef”’ with Frank’s, it’s that
their sausage comes in strips
rather than chunks, and I missed
the texture of chunks. In an
overall comparison, I would rate
Frank’s Pizza in the middle of

the two magnates, behind Pizza .

Hut and ahead of Domino’s. Yet
it is for sandwiches and
calzones, and not pizza, that I go
to Frank’s.

Frank’s sandwiches range
from $2 to $2.25 and constitute
one of the real bargains in Lex-
ington fast food. It wouldn’t be
telling to compare their sand-
wiches to say, Spanky’s, because
Frank’s sandwiches are so
distinctly Frank’s, and don’t fit
in the Spanky’s deli category.
Where Spanky’s sandwiches are
soft and melty, Frank’s are
crunchy and juicy, and are an
entirely different kind of sand-
wich.

Frank’s makes their sand-
wiches by grilling the ingre-
dients together, lightly grilling
the open bun, putting the grilled
ingredients in the bun and then
folding it. This makes for a sand-
wich with a spontaneous, throw-
it-in appearance rather than the
neatly manicured layer look. My
favorite is easily the steak and

cheese (without onions, though
you have the choice), with
mustard, mayo and lettuce. The
steak strips and cheese are grill-
ed until they become, essential-
ly, as one. It’s very hot, with a
crunchy bun, and dripping juice,
as opposed to grease (an impor-
tant distinction).

Also delicious is the ham and
cheese, which is the only other
one I’ve tried. Chow hound Hall
of Famer Bubba Schaffer had
nothing but good to say about the
meatball sandwich and the
sausage and cheese, so further
experimentation is likely.

A review of Frank’s would not
be complete without mention of
the calzones. I had never heard
of a calzone before coming to
W&L, and it’s difficult to
describe them to those who re-
main uninitiated. They’re like
contained pizzas without tomato
sauce, like a huge breaded
pocket filled with cheese and
ham. Calzones have what must
bea block of mozzerella in them,
and after most bites you’ll have
to stop the cheese stretch with
your fingers. Though the regular
calzone comes with ham, you
can treat it like a pizza in that
you can add whatever ingre-
dients you like.

Next week, the Eat Beat has a
square meal and a cold Bud. And
plays a little pool.

When the chances are one in a
hundred for a play to make it on
Broadway, a playwright such as
Washington and Lee professor
Thomas J. Ziegler knows the
odds are stacked against him.
Despite the ever-increasing
possibility that Ziegler will beat
the odds with his current ‘‘off-
off-Broadway production,’’ the
road to Broadway success still
appears long and arduous.

According to Ziegler, an
associate professor of drama,
there are two basic routes a
playwright can take. ‘The
popular route today is to send
the script to a regional theatre.
The play is tried out there first.”

“The old fashioned way,’’ the
Illinois native said, ‘‘was to
simply send your script toa New
York producer...” This method
has become too expensive, as it
now costs at least a million
dollars to produce a Broadway
show.

This is the path Ziegler took in
marketing his most acclaimed
work to date, “‘The Ninth Step.”’

“There are three stages of
New York productions,” Ziegler
said. The pinnacle, of course, is
Broadway, but with so few
theatres, a play must establish
some credentials first. These are
gained through ‘‘off-Broadway”’
and ‘‘off-off-Broadway’”’
theatres.

Approximately 1,000 ‘‘off-off-
Broadway’’ theatres exist.
These are largely non-profit
theatres that either specialize or
serve as vehicles for potential
Broadway plays. The 150 ‘‘off-
Broadway”’ theatres are all
commercial theatres and may

W&L drama profe
serve as the next stop before the
bright lights of Broadway.

Ziegler’s ‘“‘The Ninth Step’
received strong reviews at an
“off-off-Broadway” theatre in
New York, the Riverwest earlier
this year. The play tells
the story of an alcoholic who has
stopped drinking and is trying to
re-establish a relationship with -
her daughter. The ninth of

Weary conventioneers and
alumni should save a little
energy for Sunday afternoon.
The Student Activities Board
and the Interfraternity Council
will present Clarence Clemons
and the Red Bank Rockers. You
might remember Clemons as the
‘‘big man” with the sax pictured
next to Bruce Springsteen on the
cover of Springsteen’s album
“Born to Run.” This distinctive
sax is an integral part of the E
Street Band. ‘“‘When you hear
my saxophone,’’ Clemon says
candidly, ‘‘you know it’s me, it’s
not just anybody’s thing, it
makes you stop and say, ‘Hey,
that’s the Big Man!’ ”’

Clemons was born in Norfolk,
Va., and raised in a devoutly
religious Baptist family. His ear-
ly musical experiences came
from singing in the church choir
and taking sax lessons at Nor-
folk State College. Later
Clemons attended Maryland
State College on a football and
music scholarship. During his
sophomore year, Clemons
discovered the ‘‘beach music”’ of
Chesapeake Bay. He joined a

group called The Vibratones,
whose lead singer was John
Bowen. After college, Clemons
moved to Philadelphia, where he
played semi-pro football for the
Newark Bears. He was also a
member of the original Jersey
Generals. At night, Clemons
moonlighted his way through
small bands which would later
pay off in an unexpected way.
The lead singer of a band called
Joyful Noise’ introduced
Clemons to Bruce Springsteen.
They immediately became
friends and Clemons appeared
on the next Springsteen album.

It was during these early days
that Clemons earned his nick-

name “Big Man.” The group had |

become known for upstaging
their main acts, so managers
constantly warned them.
Clemon relates, ‘‘They would
say, ‘if you’re not off the stage in
20 minutes, we’re pulling the
plug!’ and I’d say ‘if you pull the
plug, I’ll kick your tail all over
this auditorium!’ ”’

Yet, even after Springsteen
and the E Street Band earned
their fame, Clemons always
dreamed of forming his own
band. So, in 1981, he opened Big
Man West in Red Bank, N.J. The

he Big Man G Company |

Clarence Clemons and the Red Bank Rockers play Wilson Field

nightclub gave him a chance to
explore his musical direction
and gave young talent a chance
at the spotlight. Clemons
assembled a house band, the
Red Bank Rockers, from crack
studio musicians and his friend
John Bowen. Clemons describes
Bowen as a classic soul shouter,
reminiscent of Wilson Pickett.

Clemons’ next step toward
fulfilling his dream was to
record an album. ‘‘Rescue” was
the result. The album relies on a
few chords (Resurrection Shuf-
fle’), as well as originals penned
by Clemons. The album also
features ‘‘Savin’ Up,’’ an
original Springsteen composi-
tion. Record magazine des-
cribes the music as ‘‘fat, frolic-
some R&B band sounds of the
’60s. Rescue conjures up mental
pictures of a recording studio
crammed to the monitors with
players, friends, and hangers-on
shouting out choruses between
sipping brews.’’ Another review
States ‘It’s a record for rolling
back the chairs and having a
good time.’’ If the record is any
indication of what the band is
capable of, Sunday afternoon
should provide one heck of a par-
ty.

\leoholics Anonymous’ 12 steps
s to patch things up with friends
ind relatives. Said Ziegler,
‘Most alcoholics feel the ninth
tep is the most difficult of all.
t's very difficult...to patch
hings up.”

The play was written and
pened at W&L in 1980. Ziegler
wen circulated his script around
lew York, and actor/producer

Roderick Cook bought the rights
to the play. “It’s called an ‘op-
tion.’ They buy the rights to pro-
duce that show...for one year,”
Ziegler explained.

The general manager, the
man who ‘“‘makes or breaks’”’ the
show, according to Ziegler, is
now being hired. ‘‘Then they’ll
cast the play. Then the show will
go out of town,”’ he says. Out of
town theatres are those ‘‘off-
Broadway’’ theatres located in
the cities of Philadelphia,
Washington and New Haven.

Although it is easier for a well-
known playwright to get a piece
onto Broadway, even the best
may receive poor reviews and
see their plays quickly with-
drawn. In the case of a revival,
“if they get a powerful enough
cast, that show can open direct-
ly,” says Ziegler.

It is the producer’s job to raise

‘ money from investors, accord-

ing to Ziegler. ‘‘A person almost
needs to be a tax lawyer to start
in this,” he says, and notes that
most investors plan on losing
money. Shows have been known
to close despite good reviews for
the sole purpose of giving the in-
vestors a tax break.

Having received good reviews
from critics and plenty of local
media coverage, Ziegler is now
working on a musical and look-
ing for a composer.

“I’ve pretty much finished the
book of a musical. It’s what New
York is buying right now,”
Ziegler said.

Having joined the faculty in
1976, Ziegler’s main background
is in theatre and light design. He
had done work in Chicago,
Toledo, Ohio, and the Virgin
Islands before coming to W&L.

Seniors display art

By SCOTT PRYSI
Staff Reporter

The duPont Gallery will host
n exhibition of the works of six
Vashington and Lee senior
tudio art majors May 9-31.

The six students — Lewis
Jlen, Steve Brooks, Peter
‘ronin, Lee Heimert, Doug
vuhn and Ross Lynde — have
een exposed to numerous ar-
istic trends while attending
V&L, and it is not surprising
hat the 32 pieces in the show
epresent at least six different
1ediums and as many styles.

Lewis Allen is presenting
ree paintings in acrylic and
halk on canvas. He chose these
jaterials primarily because of
is familiarity with their proper-
ies and the contrast in texture
hey provide. He has been in-
tuenced most profoundly by
alvador Dali and surrealism.

Steve Brooks is showing sever
‘aintings in mixed media. He
eels that collage and footage
re the medias of the 20th cen-
ury, and through them he can
nost easily capture the origin of

particular image. His work is
oncerned with rubbings of com-
non materials arranged to sug-
est their significance to each

scene.
Peter Cronin is the only senior
exclusively presenting a series
of photographs. To him photog-
raphy represents a major move-
ment in art of the 20th century.
His abstractions of everyday
scenes show the influence of the
photographers Minor White and
Ralph Gibson. He plans to enter
a program in photography at
Ohio State University next fall.
Lee Heimert is showing a
series of paintings in acrylic on
canvas. For the past two years
he has been deeply influenced by
contemporary abstractionists.

Doug Kuhn will present four
pieces of sculpture in lead as his
thesis. His works begin as wax
molds because he feels wax is
easier to work with than clay. He
has been influenced by the work
of Degas and David Hockney.

Ross Lynde is exhibiting six
works of sculpture made of cop-
per pipe, iron and steel cable.
Following a style he developed
late last year, Ross’ work shows
the influence of the contem-
porary sculptor David Smith.

All six artists will be honored
at a reception in duPont Gallery
on Wednesday, May 30, from 3-5
p.m.

Actually, Hardbodies has a
script that reads like Terms of

mention Terms and Hardbodies
in the same line borders on the
sacreligious. Another positive

Satire set

By BOB BRYANT
Entertainment Editor

Reagan Rex, a political satire
in the classic Greek style, will be
presented by the University
Theatre on Friday as part of the
festivities for the Mock Conven-
tion. The play will be performed
at 4 and 6 p.m. on a parade float
in front of the W&L student
center.

W&L Drama Professor Albert
C. Gordon wrote the play with
the help of his spring term Total
Theatre class, a class in which
students take an active role in
every stage of a theatrical pro-
duction. ‘‘The play has been an
interesting project,’’ said Gor-
don, who began soliciting ideas
for the script last fall but was
forced to rewrite the script
repeatedly as the plot and

shudder to think what our stoic
rivals would say upon viewing
this masterpiece of American
cinema. (‘‘The fall of the United
States is imminent! Ha ha ha!’’)
So, my advice to the W&L
moviegoer is basically the same
as last week. Go see Hardbodies,
but only if you can’t do
something really All-American
like attending the Mock Conven-
tion or perhaps, if you’re doing
research on strange subcultures
for Prof. White’s Sociology
Class. Happy viewing.

for Friday

characters of the presidential
race changed. ‘‘I’ve lost a lot of
characters since the first draft
of the play, but there is still a lot
to work with.”

“The idea was to create the
sort of political satire that
Aristophanes would have done in
Athens in the fifth century. The
decision to perform the play as
street theatre came later,” Gor-
don said.

Gordon’s strategy is to park
the float near the student center
and perform the play in the
street between sessions of the
Mock Convention, in the manner
that traveling medicine acts and
carnival side shows have done
for years. ‘‘We hope to have
crowds milling around,’ Gordon
said. “The performers will
definitely be playing to the
crowd.”

House Corporation, who travel-
ed to Lexington two weekends
ago from as far away as Dallas,
met with a local architect and
made contact with several con-
tractors, according to Sessoms.

“Their hope is to rebuild by
the fall of 1985,"’ he said. ‘‘That’s
not impossible, but it’s certainly
ambitious.”

‘Their general thought at this
early, early stage is to see if they
can rebuild the house with a
slightly different plan,” he said.
“They'll retain the first-floor
plan, but will possibly consider
redoing the second and third
floors to accommodate more
people.”

The existing house, the
limestone walls of which remain
standing, held 18 people, and the
new structure may be designed
to house 24 people. The fraterni-
ty has just under 35 members.

It is uncertain whether the
present structure will have to be
razed or if it can be retained.

While the alumni board was in
town, it met with University
Treasurer E. Stewart Epley,
Associate Dean of Students Dan
N. Murphy and several private
insurance adjusters.

At the suggestion of Sessoms,
the board also toured the Sigma
Nu and Kappa Alpha fraternity
houses, both of which have
recently undergone extensive
renovation.

Insurance claims have not yet
been settled, preventing the
alumni board from making
definite arrangements for
reconstruction, Sessoms said.
“Since a death was involved, the
fire investigation is proceeding
very painstakingly,’ he said
yesterday.

“Until they know what they
have to work with, it’s hard to
make plans,” he continued.

“If the official report on the
fire is filed soon, and there’s
nothing in it that causes any fur-
ther delay, we hope to settle the
insurance matters quickly.”

The contents of the house were
insured for $66,000, and the
structure was covered for as
much as $385,000. Some of the
contents of the house, including
some personal possessions and
kitchen equipment, have been
salvaged.

Shortly after the fire, the inter-
national headquarters of Phi
Gamma Delta sent a letter ex-
plaining the situation to all
alumni of the fraternity from
Washington and Lee and schools
within a 60 mile radius of Lex-
ington.

The letter said that ‘‘an early
report would indicate the fire
was caused somehow by a fire-
place.”

Religious leader Norman Vin-
cent Peale, a member of the
fraternity, sent the chapter a let-
ter expressing his ‘‘sorrow over
the death of our beloved and
talented brother, Thomas J.
Fellin.”

“The loss of your chapter
house by fire represent an
adversity to overcome by the
thought that something even bet-
ter can result,’’ he said in the let-
ter. ‘‘A finer house will rise of
which all Fiji’s can be proud.

“Phi Gamma are never de-
feated by a problem, however
difficult. The positive spirit is

‘Nine’ claims best ODAC tourney finish ever

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
baseball team completed its
most successful season in 12
years in an appropriate manner
last weekend by finishing second
in the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference tournament in
Lynchburg.

The Generals knocked off
regular-season conference
champion Randolph-Macon, 9-7,
in the semifinals before falling to
Lynchburg, 4-1, in the finals.

W&L finished the season with
a record of 11-12 (7-4 in the se-
cond half of the season), giving
the team the most victories of
any General team since 1972.
The second-place finish in the
tournament was the best ever
for the Generals.

‘In the semifinal game, the
Generals spotted Randolph-
Macon a big lead in the first in-
ning. W&L starting pitcher Kirk
Breen was relieved in the first
inning by Randy Brown after
giving up five runs, four of which
were unearned, on three walks
anda bases-loaded triple.

W&L got on the scoreboard in
the fourth inning after Hugh
Finkelstein and Milam Turner
both singled. Dave Warrenfeltz’s
sacrifice fly scored Finkelstein
from third base, cutting the
Yellow Jackets’ lead to 5-1.

The score remained unchang-
ed until the seventh inning, when
designated hitter Bill Curtiss led
off with a single and Mike
Jacoby reached base on an er-
ror. Curtiss scored after con-
secutive singles by Finkelstein
and Bill White. Pinch runner

Eric Campbell scored on a pass-
ed ball, cutting the lead to 5-3.
Turner followed with a triple to
right field, scoring White and
Finkelstein and tying the score
at 5-5. Warrenfeltz put W&L
ahead for the first time when he
singled, scoring Turner.

In the bottom of the seventh in-
ning, the Yellow Jackets regain-
ed the lead by scoring two runs
after there were two outs. Brown
gave up a double, a run-scoring
single and a walk before being
relieved by bullpen ace Peter
Detlefs. Detlefs walked the first
two batters he faced, scoring one
of the runners and giving Ran-
dolph-Macon a 7-6 lead, before

getting the third out.

W&L trailed 7-46 entering the
ninth inning before rallying for
the win. Mike Walsh led off with
a walk and Kevin Golden follow-
ed with a single. With one out,
Curtiss grounded to the pitcher
for a possible game-ending dou-
ble play, but the throw to second
base sailed into center field,
allowing the runner to score
from second. Jacoby singled to
right, loading the bases, and
White delivered the crucial hit
—a single to right field that
scored two runs and put W&L
ahead to stay at 9-7.

Loyola loss hands

lax worst record
since ’69 season

By JOHN HARRISON
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
lacrosse team saw its regular
season draw to its poorest close
in 15 years Saturday with a 12-8
loss to Loyola on Wilson Field
that dropped the Generals’
season record to 5-9.

Against Loyola, the Generals’
downfall began, as it did
throughout the second half of the
season, late in the third quarter.
The Greyhounds’ Pat Lamon
notched three goals and used a
head dodge to set up another ina
five-goal outburst that broke a
4-4 deadlock.

Once they had established con-
trol, the Greyhounds held on to
the ball and used up the clock on
two separate occasions. Asked
why W&L did not put much

pressure on the ball when they
were behind, Daly said, ‘‘We
were taking the chance that
Loyola was going to make a
miscue.”’

Jeff Mason’s fifth goal of the
day and Lee Heimert’s low
bouncer from just inside the re-
taining line drew the Generals as
close as 10-7 with 3:26 left. But
another stall, which was com-
pleted by Lamon’s sixth goal,
took away the chance for a rally.
Chris John’s third solo rush of
the game created the final score.

No lacrosse team at W&L has
finished as many as four games
below .500 since the 1969 squad
went 1-8.

ninth inning. Brown pitched 6 14
innings and allowed one earned
run.

‘Detlefs did one heck of a
job,” said W&L head coach Jim
Murdock. ‘‘Randy Brown also
did an excellent job in the middle
innings. We were patient at the
plate and eventually got to their
starting pitcher.”’

Finkelstein, Turner and White
each had three hits for the
Generals.

In the championship game
against Lynchburg under the
lights at City Stadium, a tired,
banged-up General team went
hitless through the first seven in-
nings as Lynchburg built a 40
lead.

The Hornets scored two runs
in the fourth inning against W&L
starter White on a double, a walk
and a single. Lynchburg added
two more runs in the fifth when
the lead-off batter reached base
after striking out when the ball
eluded catcher Jacoby. The next
batter tripled, scoring the lead
runner. The second run came
when a Lynchburg player scored
from third base on a passed ball.
White was relieved by Bill
Schoettelkotte in the fifth inning.

W&L scored its lone run in

the eighth inning, when Finkel-
stein singled, reached second
after Turner walked, and scored
after Walsh singled.

White, pitching on only two
days rest, after going 1014 inn-
ings against Eastern Mennonite,
took the loss for the Generals. He
ended the season with a 6-2
record and an_ earned-run-
average of 1.63, best in the con-
ference.

“The greatest satisfaction we
got as a team from this season
was that we had fun. It was en-
joyable for the kids to play
baseball,’’ Murdock said.

The Generals lose four seniors
from the 1984 squad, co-captains
Warrenfeltz and Walsh, Golden
and Campbell. Warrenfeltz,
Walsh and Golden, all four-year
Starters at W&L, comprised
three-fourths of the Generals’ in-
field.

“These are four super young
men,’’ Murdock said. ‘‘As I’ve
said all season, a good deal of
our success can be attributed to
our seniors. They’ve settled for
nothing short of excellence yet
weren’t concerned with _in-
dividual statistics. They were
concerned with winning ball
games.”

Blythe earns bid

Senior Bruce Blythe has been
selected to receive an at-large
berth in the NCAA Division III
Golf Championships to be held at
the State University. of
New York at Oswego on May
15-18.

Blythe served as co-captain of
the Generals and earned All-Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
honors this year.

‘IT am extremely pleased for
Bruce because he worked hard
on his game and really earned
the right to play in the NCAAs,”
W&L head golf coach Buck Les-

lie said. ‘I am also proud for the
team because his selection is a
reflection on the entire pro-
gram.”’

Blythe is the fourth W&L
player to receive the at-large
berth in the championships’ 10-
year history. W&L has twice
sent an entire team: 1977, when
the Generals finished seventh,
and in 1979 when they placed
ninth.

Blythe fired a combined 155 at
the Ingleside Country Club at the
ODAC Championships to lead
the Generals to a third-place
finish.

Downpour stymies
track NCAA attempt

Despite the fact that they ran
some of their fastest races of
their careers, three Washington
and Lee runners failed to qualify
for the NCAA National Cham-
pionships in a downpour at the
Maryland Invitational Sunday.

Angus McBryde ran his sec-
ond-fastest 1,500 meters in a
time of 3:56.0, but did not better
the NCAA qualifying time of
3:53.7. McBryde, a cross country
All-America, competed in the
NCAAs last year.

Mark Pembroke, who broke
the school record in the 800

meters with a time of 1:53.9, and
Paul Chapman, who covered the
distance in 1:54.8, also came up
short. The qualifying time for
the 800 meters is 1:52.3.

“The steady rain was a
definite factor and could have
been the difference in not quali-
fying,” said W&L track coach
Norris Aldridge.

Saturday, the three, plus shot
putter Tom Murray and triple
jumper Bill Rhinehart, will try
again at the Cavalier Classic in
Charlottesville.

Lacrosse: Should we stay or should we go?

MIKE STATCHURA
Sports Editor

..As the clock ticked down Saturday
afternoon at Wilson Field, the tired sort of
frustration that one feels after failing on
numerous attempts to complete a task
that-you-once-did-effortlessly seemed to
fully settle itself not only on the W&L
lacrosse players and coaches, but also on
the fans, who have perhaps come to expect
too much and now are bitter and
frustrated, too. The question of the NCAA
Division I status of W&L lacrosse is too
pressing right now to be avoided. Head
coach Dennis Daly said in an interview
just after he took over the reins, “As long
as we can remain competitive, I say ‘Why
not (continue to compete in Division I)?" "’
Daly also said that ‘‘competitive’’ was a
word that would have to be evaluated after
every year. His reasonable goal for stay-
ing competitive was to be in the running
for an NCAA tournament bid. Well, W&L is
not going to be one of those teams in the
running this year. Nor was it last year.
This is the first time in 15 years that there
have been back-to-back losing seasons.
(This is not an attack, just putting things in
perspective. )

We come back to the word ‘‘com-
petitive.’ Does ‘‘competitive’’ mean winn-
ing half of your contests against Division I
schools? Pushing a Division I squad to its
limit? Having some sort of chance at
beating all your Divison I foes? Or
something else? Reviewing the season,

‘there were games that W&L was very

capable of winning (against scholarship
schools), but did not (could not?). On the
negative side, when the Generals faced top
Division III schools they were more than
seriously challenged —they Were beaten

with a dilemma. Stay in Division I and

will be smashed. (We will be lowering
ourselves, I believe the sentiment would
be.) With the advent of the scholarship in
college lacrosse — and thus the increased
efforts of schools like Johns Hopkins,

In Division I, they are not on the same
level. I do not see this trend changing, and
this belief is solely based on the effects of
the scholarship. Even if a good lacrosse
player has the grades to be here, he
logically will still choose to go to the school
that will promise him a free education.
W&L can’t promise that. Thus, my sugges-
tion for W&L lacrosse is a choice.

We can choose to compete in Division
III, where we will maintain the cherished
student-athlete tradition and be a very
‘“‘competitive’’ team. Or there is another
route. We can start to give scholarships.
That’s right, with an important stipula-
tion: We must not allow educational stan-
dards to deteriorate. In this way, W&L
would remain attractive for the student-
athlete who is qualified educationally to be

not on the same level.

In Division I, they are

 

Maryland, U.Va., North Carolina, etc. to
take advantage of it — W&L’s efforts to re-
main competitive have been valiant, at
times successful, but in the long run
(manisfesting itself at present?) are fated
to push W&L out of the competitiveness
range. Right now, and this can be of little
doubt to anyone who knows lacrosse, W&L
is a very good Division III lacrosse team.

here, but cannot gather the bucks. ( Finan-
cial aid is important, but too often it does
not fully combat this situation.) W&L
needs to be a force in lacrosse again and it
can be, given the right thinking...

(This has not in any way been an indict-
ment of the coaches or especially the
athletes of the lacrosse program. On the
contrary, my respect for these exceptional

gentlemen will always be high. It is one
thing to face external pressure, but
another thing entirely when your unin-
formed peers are not satisfied with your
best efforts. My hat is tipped to you
gentlemen for time and again picking
yourself up off the ground and meeting the
adversary eyeball-to-eyeball, knowing full
well that he might be carrying a pistol to
your slingshot. )

.... Speaking of spitting adversity in the
eye, praises are to be extended to the
Smith Field (baseball) group and Coach
Jim Murdock, on their reaching the ODAC
finals before bowing out. Was quite im-
pressed with the way they turned them-

....Finally, I'll give you more on this
Russian Olympic-pullout story, if it holds,
next week. In the meantime, let this suf-
fice: The boneheads who made this
brilliant decision in Moscow perhaps are
too far removed from understanding the
spirit of athletics — and in particular the
Olympic movement — to ever act with
common sense. I guess that explains their
decision....

This spring, aside from
lacrosse, baseball, track and the
other sports going on, a new
fetish has taken over in the
quads. Dormitory basketball,
featuring the best talents from
each hall under the leadership of
their dorm counselors has pitted
hall vs. hall in fight-to-the-finish
basketball.

Picture if you will Roland
Simon vs. Bob Tomaso, Tori
Richardson vs. Chris Cartmill,
Tim Schurr vs. Tom Schurr in
the battle of the brothers. The

 

goes on and on.

According to Roland Simon,
one of the dorm counselors, the
primary purpose of the games is
just to have fun. Under the direc-
tion of dorm counselor Tomaso,
games are scheduled during con-
venient hours such as after sup-
per on weekdays and on the
weekends.

Weather permitting, the inter-
dormitory games are played on
the outdoor courts, located be-
tween the tennis courts and the
baseball diamond at VMI. Be-
cause of scheduling conflicts,
games weren’t able to be

scheduled in the gym until
recently.)

“I think the main intention of
these games is to get guys who
don’t already know each other to
meet each other in a relaxed,
friendly atmosphere,” Simon
continued, ‘‘besides, they (the
games) are a good way to have
fun during this term.”

Plans for next year include
broadening the scope of the
games to include other sports
besides basketball.

And you thought the Roanoke-
W&L basketball games were ex-
citing.

then won three of four but ended
up losing four of its last five. Da-
ly said that the basic strategy at
the beginning of the season was
to have a man-to-man defense
that would create unsettled
situations for the attack. But
after the Generals opened with
four losses in five games, they
started to use a patient offense
that would hold the ball for as
long as possible. With that ap-
proach, W&L went 3-1 and had
its best showing in three years
against Virginia.

Another losing streak follow-
ed, but Daly pointed to the
overall record (4-4) under the
new strategy. Referring to the
losses to Denison, UMBC and
Washington, Daly said that the
team did not execute the game
plan, especially when it came to
taking high percentage shots.

tions, Cornell and Yale, will be
away games over spring break.
North Carolina will return to the
schedule for another away
game. The home schedule is
made up of Maryland, Virginia,
Roanoke, Duke, U.M.B.C. and
Middlebury. The number of mid-
week games was reduced from
six to three. Said Daly, ‘This
will eliminate some class con-
flicts for the players. I felt this
was a concern for us this year.”’
He added that having fewer mid-
week games will help the team
be better prepared for games the
following weekend.

The Generals will play an
alumni game at 3 p.m. on Satur-
day at Wilson Field. The alumni
squad will feature members of

Cannon, Mize go for

Division Ill crowns

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee tennis
players Craig Cannon and Roby
Mize began singles and doubles
competition today in the NCAA
Division III National Champion-
ships at Emory University in
Atlanta, Ga. The tournament
has a 64-man draw in singles
competition, while 32 teams are
competing for the doubles title.
The tournament is scheduled to
end Sunday.

Cannon, team captain and a
senior, enters the tournament
with a regular season singles
record of 14-7 and a single rank-
ing among Division III tennis
players in the country of 25.

Mize, a freshmen, enters the
tournament with a 14-9 record
and ranked 41. Cannon and Mize
compiled a 13-7 record as a
doubles team and achieved a No.
29 ranking. Head tennis coach
Gary Franke remarked, how-
ever, that the Cannon/Mize
team has defeated teams ranked
ahead of them since the coaches
released the last rankings and
that they are now probably rank-
ed as high as 25th.

Assessing the Generals’
chances at the national tourna-
ment, Franke believes that the
top 30 players in the 64-man
singles draw are capable of win-
ning the championship. Coach
Franke added, “It (the cham-
pionship) depends on who can
put it all together and have a
good weekend of tennis.”’

Rain and bad weather have
prevented Cannon and Mize
from practicing as much as they
would like, but Craig said he

believes that he is prepared for
the tournament.

“It’s hard to get motivated
after a long season, but I feel
ready,’ Cannon said. Cannon
would like to make it at least to
the round of 16, which means he
has to win his first two matches.
He said he believes he can reach
the round of 16, but he also
stresses the importance of his
first round match. Cannon said,
“The first round match is
always the hardest because you
area little nervous and uptight.”
He added that a victory in the
first round builds a player’s con-
fidence and gives him momen-
tum.

Concerning doubles, Mize said
he believes that he and Cannon
are playing very well as a team.
Mize said, ‘Since the beginning
of the season we have been try-
ing to become familiar with each
other’s tendencies on the court ‘‘
Mize believes that he and Can-
non played their best together in
capturing the ODAC doubles ti-
tle earlier this month. He also
belives that he and Cannon have
made a lot of progress this
season as they acquired more
experience playing together.
“We lost a lot of matches earlier
in the season that we would not
lose now,”’ Mize said.

Cannon has represented W&L
in singles and doubles competi-
tion at the NCAA Division III Na-
tional Championships, however,
Mize will be playing in the na-
tional championships for the
first time. Mize stated, ‘‘It’s go-
ing to be a learning experience,
but that doesn’t mean I’m going
to write it off as a freshman lear-
ning experience. I’m going for
it!”

Convention

preparations

— began two
years ago

By JOHN WILTSE
Mock Convention Correspondent

When the first drum rolls
tomorrow morning and the ban-
ner announcing the ‘‘Washington
and Lee 1984 Mock Democratic
Convention’’ begins to make its
way down Main Street, a week-
end consisting of over two years
of preparation will have begun.

The long cycle of research and
planning will be complete for co-
chairmen Steve Lewis and Pete
Muller.

Having all eyes focused on
Washington and Lee for this
event, with its $102,500 budget
and accomodations for thou-
sands of participants, one would
expect an air of tension and anx-
iety around those student
organizers responsible for the
quadrennial project — but none
can be found.

‘We are better prepared than
any other convention. We wished
it was this past weekend,” said
Lewis, a senior. ‘‘The tension of
not having things done is just not
there.”’

The two chairmen have follow-
ed a broai four-stage process
beginning in May 1982, with their
permanent appointments by the
Executive Committee and lead-
ing up to the opening gavel
tomorrow afternoon.

Lewis and Muller explained
that the first stage lasted ap-
proximately six months and con-
sisted of ‘‘establishing our direc-
tion’’ by looking through the files
of previous conventions and
creating an organizational
framework, budget and
schedule.

A three-month appointment
stage, which Muller described as
a ‘‘tedious process,’’ followed in
October 1982. Applications and
interviews were processed for
the positions of 50 state chair-
men as well as approximately 20
members of the Steering Com-
mittee, which consists of the
heads of the various convention
committees.

The third phase, beginning
last spring and continuing into
this past fall, was described by
Lewis as ‘‘when we molded
everything together and saw the
gaps ... we saw people we had to
replace among the state
chairmen and the Steering Com-
mittee.”’

In September the EC rescind-
ed the appointment of the third
Mock Convention chairman, in
charge of political research,
Save Matrazzo. The resigna-

tions of Len Howard, Lower
South Regional Coordinator, and
John Haywood, Facilities Chair-
man, followed the EC’s decision.

“It was definitely our lowest
point,’’ Muller said. ‘‘We simply
had to consolidate the leadership
in the upper echelon.”’

At the time of the organiza-
tional shake-up, Student Body
President Bob Jenevein termed
it ‘potentially very destruc-
tive.”’

‘“‘We did have the potential to
fall behind schedule, but it just
didn’t slow us down,” Muller
concluded.

The 1984 chairmen worked
within the basic Washington and
Lee convention structures con-
sisting of two main branches —
the Steering Committee and the
state chairmen.

“We brought the Steering
Committee along to a point
where they knew their job well,
so they could relate their posi-
tion and direction to the in-
dividual state chairmen, Lewis
explained. ‘It was interesting
watching Steering Committee
members make presentations to
the chairmen without having to
rely on us for everything.”’

The major change from
previous conventions cited by
the two chairmen was in the
Steering Committee framework.
They split up some tasks that
had been under one steering
committee member and created
new positions when they saw the
need.

Unlike past conventions,
Muller and Lewis also shared
the responsibilities of chairmen
with the authority ‘‘coming from
both of us.’’ Both students sat in
on Steering Committee and state
chairmen meetings and worked

.in all facets of the planning.

“‘What we did was broaden our
responsibilities while tightening
up on the Steering Committee
positions,’’ Muller said.

Commenting on W&L’s “‘sys-
tem’’ for predicting the correct
presidential nominee, Lewis and
Muller said that the key to the
success is each state chairman’s
doing political research in his

State. —
Ensuring the 13th correct

prediction became the job of
Jack Dent during the convention
reorganization process in Oc-
tober. It was at this time that
Dent, a senior, was named chair-
man of the Credentials Commit-
tee and became responsible for
coordinating the political resear-
ch.

The Credentials Committee is

 

1948—zan Warren was the California favorite.

 

 

 

composed of Dent along with the
four regional research coor-
dinators. In addition to oversee-
ing each state’s political
research throughout the cam-
paign, the committee will serve
as the final political check for
each state chairman at the con-
vention.

Serious research began in Oc-
tober and November of 1983.

“The political
was not done last spring as it
should have been...that is why I
was appointed,”’ Dent said.

Dent described the political
research process as simply lay-
ing the groundwork of contacts
and organization and then just
keeping abreast of develop-
ments through various re-
sources.

He stressed that the state
chairmen have been doing the
research and said that ‘‘we (the
Credentials Committee) are let-

ting them make the prediction.... .

It is their thing now.”

Dent said that some of the
chairmen split up the respon-
sibilities of political research by
districts and have gotten many
members of their delegations in-
volved.

“Many of the state chairmen
and regional coordinators know
much more politically than I
do,”’ he said, adding that in the
past two weeks he has been con-
centrating on the organizational
details of the Convention with
Lewis and Muller.

For those state chairmen
whose states have not had their
primaries or caucuses yet, their
work has been one long research
process continuing through
Saturday.

For the other three-quarters of
the state chairmen, whose
states already have gone to the
voting booth, the last few months
have been spent verifying their
state delegate counts and con-
centrating on determing the
preference of any uncommitted
delegates.

Dent cited three major
political barometers the student
researchers utilized. Factual in-
formation about the campaign
was obtained from the press
while party leaders served as
contacts for inside and subjec-
tive information. Questionnaires
sent out to various people were
helpful in confirming their final
hypothesis.

groundwork.

Each state chairman has also
familiarized himself with his
state’s rules governing the loyal-
ty of delgates in case the mock
nomination should go beyond the
first ballot, which Dent feels is

kely.

ent and his staff did not have
much to work with as far as
political information from past
conventions was concerned.
_ ‘We had seen barely what
they had done in the past, and
then we learned by experience
..., altering things which didn’t
work along the way,” Dent said.

A common goal mentioned by
all leaders of this year’s Mock
Convention has been to keep ac-
curate records to pass on to
future conventions.

One of the new political tools
begun by this convention was the
predicting of state primary and
caucus results. The W&L predic-
tions had a 65-70 percent ac-
curacy rate.

“Predicting the primaries
really got the political ball roll-
ing,”’ Dent said.

Dent admits that a complex
nomination still exists just in the
fact of having three candidates
left in the race and 35-40 percent
of the delegates still to be
chosen. At the end of last
week, Walter Mondale had ap-
proximately 1,236 delegates to
Gary Hart’s 670 and Jesse
Jackson’s 206 delegates with
roughly 1,400 delegates still to be
selected before July.

Dent said that once the uncom-
mitted delegates start to commit
their votes, Mondale will most
likely be ‘‘put over the top.”

647 votes will be needed to
secure the nomination at the
Mock Convention.

“We are 99 percent sure of a
correct presidential nominee,”
related co-chairmen Lewis and
Muller.

For the past two weeks; the
politcal emphasis has been on
the vice presidential nomina-
tion. Each state chairman has
been researching possible can-
didates from his state and
leaders have been finalizing a
list of nominees.

Sen. Lloyd Bentsen from
Texas seems to be a popular can-
didate and a likely nominee ac-
cording to Dent.

The financial end of the 1984
convention has also developed

into a strong and supportive
aspect.

At the end of last September
only one-fifth of the projected
budget had been raised while the
end of last week saw 90 percent
of all funds raised, according to
Mike Shelton, treasurer for the
Mock Convention.

The remaining 10 percent of
the budget is expected to be rais-
ed this week in memorabilia
sales and final contributions
with the convention ending up
“‘in the black.”’

Having no lists from previous
conventions to use as a guide,
fund-raising efforts began in
September with contributions
solicited from alumni, former
convention participants, parents
and the individual state delega-
tions.

Shelton was very pleased with
the efforts of the delegations in
raising close to $20,000; $5,000 of
which went to the Steering Com-
mittee. A total of $8,000 was rais-
ed through contribution and the
February pavilion party.

The remainder of the Mock
Convention funds came from a
Hatton W. Sumners’ Foundation
grant that totaled $31,000 in
February and another $14,000 in
interest resulting from a
separate endowment also given
to W&L by the Sumners’ Foun-
dation.

A final $10,000 came from stu-
dent taxes.

The 1984 budget has been by
far the largest of any Mock Con-
vention.

“I was overwhelmed with the
fund-raising response we got,”’
Shelton said. ‘‘It is a testimony
to the high regard the convention
is held in across the country.”’

That high regard will be tested
this weekend when the 18th W&L
Mock Convention is convened.

Many processes and cycles
have been completed to bring
this event to its completion.
Muller summed it up this way in
speaking about his goals for the
Convention: ‘“‘It should be a
sense of a shared project ... a
culmination of a lot of people to
be proud together of what we
have done.”

The EC already has called for
the applications for the tem-
porary chairmen of the 1988
Mock Convention. With the clos-
ing gavel on Saturday, a new cy-
cle of success will begin.

Conservatives & their liberal education

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

For many Washington and Lee
students, the Mock Convention
will be just that, a ‘‘mock” con-
vention, although not in the pe-
jorative sense.

Many students will be arguing
for Democratic candidates and
issues they could never support
in real life. Of course, this is not
the first time that this has oc-
curred at our traditionally con-
servative campus.

According to junior Scott
Tilley, who served as president
of W&L’s College Republicans
this year and will work on the
state level next year, the 1976
Mock Convention was especially
divided. The College Republi-
cans were so upset with the plat-
form submitted by the Platform
Committee that year that they
had the Committee’s platform
defeated and submitted their
own proposals, which were pass-
ed. by a majority of the
delegates. Tilley, who chairs this
year’s Platform Committee, will
not allow a similar incident to
occur this weekend.

A major question is whether
W&L is as conservative as
everyone believes, and what ef-
fect this will have on our Conven-
tion. “I’ve heard many times
that W&L is one of the most con-
servative schools in the eoun-
try,” Tilley said. While he has no
data on where the University
ranks on a conservative scale,
Tilley believes this to be true,

and uses as evidence the com-
parative size of the College
Republicans (200 members,
each paying four dollars dues)
and the University’s Young
Democrats (less than a dozen
members and no dues. )

Convention co-Chairman
Peter Muller feels that the
school is definitely Republican,
but that liberals on campus feel
too intimidated to be vocal.
“There is a more liberal under-
current which is less pronounc-
ed,’’ Muller said.

If such an undercurrent does
exist, it has not resulted in any
left-wing or liberal groups that
other campuses find a need for,
according to Tilley.

With the campus’ conser-
vative tendencies and the large
number of College Republicans
participating in the Convention,
two more major questions arise:
“Do the students have any pro-
blem representing a viewpoint
they don’t believe in?’”’ and ‘‘Has
working on the Mock Convention
affected students’ views?”’.

“TI can separate (my personal
views and Convention views). I
have to do the research in my
state. There’s really nothing per-
sonal about that,’ Vermont
State Chairman Ron Fenster-
macher said, adding, ‘‘I would
find it very hard to argue against
what I think.”

Mike Bearup, chairman of the
New Mexico delegation, feels it
is a good idea for students to be
exposed to both sides, although
the Convention has not altered

   

his political outlook. ‘‘I don’t see
any conflicts,” he said.

Muller does feel that the Con-
vention has affected his outlook.
“It may have dulled my ada-
mant Republican views a bit. It
made me more sympathetic to
Democratic views,”’ he said.

“Tt hasn’t really affected me
either way,’’ said the Conven-
tion Executive Director, Lee
Feldman, a senior and a mem-
ber of the College Republicans.
“| know that I have my views
outside of the Convention.”’

Tilley feels that working as
Platform Chairman has actually
solidified his Republican ideas
because he discovered how
““Judicrous’’ some of the
Democratic planks are. “It

Mock platform planks lead to voicing of student epeesens

helped polarize my views,”
Tilley said.

But Tilley said he and his com-
mittee have developed a plat-
form that may be more liberal
than anything the Democrats
could ever produce. It may seem
odd that the committee would
develop such an authentic plat-
form but that is in the spirit of
the Convention, which can be
divided into two parts.

The major part of the Conven-
tion is the students’ striving for
authenticity in determining the
party’s candidate. The second
part is the students’ opportunity
to voice personal opinions con-
cerning the platform.

“The way we’re doing it is
good,”’ Tilley said. ‘Once we’ve
researched it (the platform), I

 

aoe CQ lendar

think it’s good that we can have
the students’ input.”

Indiana State Chairman Greg
Flentje considers it a smart idea
to allow student opinion to be ex-
pressed in the platform. ‘‘The
platform will be the most dif-
ficult to argue against their
views,”’ he said.

“It’s important to have some
aspect that represents the
University,’’ said Bearup, who
believes that it would be too dif-
ficult for a delegation to
research the platform accurate-
ly.

According to Muller, the Con-
vention is meant to be both ac-
curate and collegiate. “It (the
platform) is such a stringent
Democratic view...moderated
by W&L students.”

As the media concentrate on
the Convention’s accuracy the
platform gives the students the
occasion to make their views
known to the nation, according
to Feldman. “The platform is

present our views. It’s our
chance to actually be heard,”’ he
explained.

Marion County, Ind., offers an
example of what it is like
to be a Democrat in a very

‘Republican sector of the nation

or on a very Republican campus.
Supposedly the second most
Republican district in the nation,
Marion County was ger-
rymandered street by street
following the 1980 census.

Marion County Democratic
Chairman John Livengood be-
lieves that there are actually
more Democrats than Republi-
cans in the county. His approach
to politics may be the opposite of
what some would expect.
“Traditionally, Marion County
... has been a primary (election)
influence,’’ Livengood said.
“‘We’ve shifted gears since I’ve
been chairman.”’

Rather than concentrate on
the primary, where the party
could have definite influence,
the Democrats have switched
emphasis to the November elec-
tion, which any decent
Republican candidate is almost
sure to win. The Democrats will
not publicly endorse any can-
didate in the primary in an at-

tempt not to divide the party
during the general election,
Livengood said. ai : ER

Livengood presents an overly ''* . 7 <a a -
positive attitude in an area , al
where a liberal would seem to
have little to be positive about.
Terming his party ‘‘out-
organized and out-financed,”
Livengood still is optimistic.

‘“‘We’re going to make our can-
didates competitive,’’ he said.
For the most part, the
Democratic candidates in
Marion County who have been
competitive are those who
display a more conservative
outlook.

No matter how weak a state’s
Democratic party, none of the
states will have trouble attract-
ing delegates for the real
Democratic Presidential Con-
vention in San Francisco. On the
W&L campus, that is hardly the
case.

At a University where many
students will not go to hear a
Soviet speaker because he is a
Communist, could it be that die-
hard conservatives are bypass-
ing this year’s Convention
because it is Democratic? The

correlation does not seem to ex-
ist.

According to Feldman, both
the incoming and outgoing State
Chairmen of the Virginia College
Republicans are traveling to
Lexington: this weekend to

delegate slots with Lexington
High School students, and at-
tributes the poor turnout com-
pared to the 1980 Republican
Convention to student apathy.
“I’ve seen increased student
apathy toward events,”’ he said.

Tilley believes that the lower

political outlook ‘‘only on a very
superficial level.”” ‘“‘They (the
students) realize this is a one-
time thing when they’re here,”
he said.

With the large number of
dyed-in-the-wool Republicans
who are participating, it does not

that students are shying away
because of political ideology.
Those who are strong Republi-
cans can still take heart in the
fact this is a Mock Democratic
Convention and, like Tilley,
should hope that W&L holds a
Mock Democratic Convention

course, would mean _ the
Republicans will always be in
power.

For better or for worse, no
matter how accurate our predic-
tions, this weekend’s quadren-
nial event will certainly have to
go down in W&L’s annals as one

turnout can be attributed to every four years. That, of of our truly mock conventions.

The tale of one state delegation

By MIKE SINGER
and
PARKER SCHENEKER
Summer Interns

A year ago the 1984 Mock Con-
vention was just a distant vision
of some unknown (or rather
‘‘well-known’’) happening,
perhaps even bigger than Fancy
Dress itself. After the positions
for state chairmen of the Con-
vention had been filled through
the application and interview
process, we began some early
work in preparation for the com-
ing year.

During the spring of 1983 we
began to brainstorm about the
possibilities for the Texas
Delegation, especially in fund-
raising. .Having printed our
delegation stationery, we sent
our first fund-raising letters to
graduating seniors. Although we
received no response, we had
our first exposure to the hard-
ships of soliciting for delegation
funds.

During the summer a slew of
letters was sent to raise money
for the delegation. Working with
delegation Secretary Anthony
Interrante, three different let-
ters were sent to parents of
delegates, parents of potential
delegates and parents of enter-
ing freshmen from Texas. At the
time we were unsure as to the
response to the letters, but we
had made a good effort, per-
sonalizing each letter and typing
every envelope. The letter would
eventually raise over $7000! In
addition, we sent letters to. the

co-chairmen of the Texas Dele-
gation of the 1980 Mock Conven-
tion. The response was prompt
and most helpful.

When we returned in the fall,
we began efforts to find cor-
porate sponsors. A letter was
sent to Dod Distributing Com-
pany, the major distributor of
Coors beer in the area, two days
after our return to Lexington.
We had chosen Coors as the of-
ficial beer because of its great
popularity in Texas, plus the
availability of it in the area. A
week after sending the letter, we
received a telephone call from
Steve Dod, president of the com-
pany, to meet him in Lexington.
During our visit with him, we
were assured of a sponsorship by
Coors.

We returned in the winter to
meet with Mr. Dod’s assistant,
Henley Carter, and Michele
Burgwyn, the ‘young-adult
coordinator’ for the regional
Coors office in Charlotte, N.C. At
the meeting with Carter and
Burgwyn, we finalized plans for
a float design and received
Coors paraphernalia. In addi-
tion, Mr. Carter promised us
$500 to “cover research ex-
penses.’’ When we returned to
Lexington that.day, we informed
the Steering Committee of the
sponsorship.

The money from the three
summer letters began to roll in,
as we had already raised $500
before most states had even
begun fundraising. Moreover,
our largest check was for just
$100, while most were for $25.

Before we left for Thanksgiving,
we sent 200 more letters to alum-
ni.

Our firs: delegation meeting
was Called during the latter part
of fall term, when we explained
that we would handle different
areas of delegation business.
Parker Scheneker handled the
finances, parties and float, while
Michael Singer would handle the
research, prediction and conven-
tion activities.

At our second meeting the
delegates were asked to fill out
information cards so we could
assign them to a certain area of
the convention (float, parties,
research, etc.). Perhaps the

most embarrassing point at the
meeting occurred when we ask-
ed the 30-or-so delegates if they
knew the name of their con-
gressmen. Only two or three said
they were absolutely sure! How
ironic that would later be.

With most of the states being
unable to raise sufficient
delegation funds, we decided to
give the Steering Committee our
summer solicitation letters,
along with several ideas that we
had incorporated in our letters.
The letter and the pledge
sheet/‘‘Mock Convention
History’’ was sent by every
delegation except ours, which
had already done so.

By the time the Iowa caucuses
had finished, we had printed a
research survey to be sent to our
contacts. However, with the
steering committee’s interest in
the survey, we gave it to them to
be fine-tuned for the entire Con-
vention. Furthermore, with the
race developing, we could only
hope that it would not be a Mon-
dale run-away. We began to view
the other primaries with interest
and soon began to realize that
this could very well be an in-
teresting race.

Meetings were scheduled for
the delegation every Tuesday
night, as we assigned a delegate
to each of the 27 congressional
districts. We planned on even-
tually voting on our choice for
the Democratic nomination by
district, and we decided that we
would predict the outcome of the
important May 5 Texas cau-
cuses. During every Tuesday
meeting each delegate from the
various districts gave a short
report on the political situation
in the area.

Plans had also begun for a par-
ty sponsored by Coors. Having
informed the steering commit-
tee of our plans, we were put ‘‘on
hold’’ to investigate the idea
before the February break. We
were finally informed that we
could have the party just one
month before the date we had
planned for it. Because of this,
the selection for bands was low
and dates to actually have the
party were slim-to-none. After
scheduling the party, we asked
the Alabama, Colorado and Ten-
nessee delegation to join us. All
plans were finalized.

Two days before the party, the
administration informed us that
we could face serious problems
with the law, having advertised
a ‘‘BYOB” pavilion party. After
long discussions concerning the
potential legal ramifications of
the party, we decided to go for
broke and have it. The result

Virginia’s Robb will
welcome convention

Va. Governor Charles S. Robb
will deliver a welcoming address
from the Commonwealth of
Virginia at Friday’s first session
of the Mock Convention.

Robb, who received his law
degree in 1973 from the Universi-
ty of Virginia, was elected
Lieutenant Governor of Virginia
in 1977.

On November 3, 1981, Robb
defeated Republican Attorney

General J. Marshall Coleman to
become Virginia’s 64th gover-
nor. Considered one of the more
prominent Democratic gover-
nors in the country, Robb is a
member of the National Gover-
nors’ Association and _ the
Democratic Governors’ Con-
ference.

Robb, 44, is married to Lynda
Johnson Robb, and the couple
has three daughters.

Proxmire is keynote speaker

Sen. William Proxmire, a
Democrat from Wisconsin, will
deliver the Mock Convention’s
keynote address at the Conven-
tion’s final session Saturday,
May 12, beginning at 9:30 a.m.

Proxmire’s distinguished
political career goes back to
1950, when he was elected to the
Wisconsin State Assembly. In
1957 he was elected to fill the
US. Senate seat left vacant by
the death of Joseph McCarthy.
He was re-elected the following
year to his first full six-year
term and was again re-elected in
1964, 1970, 1976 and 1982.

In both the 1976 and the 1982
campaigns, Proxmire accepted
no campaign contributions and
spent less than $200.

The former chairman of the
Senate Banking Committee,
Proxmire now is ranking minori-
ty member of the Senate Bank-
ing, Housing, and Urban Affairs
Committee and a member of the
Appropriations Committee and
the Congressional Joint Eco-
nomic Committee.

money has become a monthly

According to the National Tax-
payers Union, Proxmire held the

each of the last four years for

fundraising paid off.

By Thursday, May 3, just two
days before the Texas Caucuses,
those delegates who had resear-
ched the various districts met to
fill out questionnaires and
ballots concerning the election.
Each had made numerous
telephone calls from the Mock
Convention office asking for the
favorite Democratic candidate
in the area and the percentage
lead of the front-runner.

From the ballots and ques-
tionaires, a group of four (Mike
Singer, David Webber, Anthony
Interrante and Markham Pyle)
met to make the prediction from
the information provided by the
questionnaires. The final predic-

tion was then posted in the Mock
Convention office a day in ad-
vance of the actual caucuses.
The greatest irony of all in-
volved the members of the
delegation who had not even
known their congressmen. They
were now predicting with amaz-
ing accuracy how their districts
would vote in the May 5 caucuses
for the Democratic nomination.
Based on months of research,
the delegation had made an ac-
curate prediction; just a few
percentage points off the actual
vote. With the work on finances,
the float and prediction in the
final stages, the Texas Delega-
tion is indeed ready for the 1984
Mock Democratic Convention.

Sen. Randolph
will present platform

Lawmaker ending 52-year career

Sen. Jennings Randolph, a
Democrat from West Virginia,
will deliver the platform address
at the convention’s second ses-
sion Friday evening.

Randolph, who will retire
following the completion of his
term in January 1985, is a
veteran of the New Deal. He was
first elected to the House of
Representatives in 1932 with the
Franklin Roosevelt administra-
tion. Defeated in 1946, he entered
the private sector and then was
elected to the Senate in 1958.

The former chairman of the
Senate Environment and Public
Works Committee, Randolph is
now ranking minority member

on that committee and is the sec-
ond ranking Democrat on the
Labor and Human Resources
Committee and the Committee
on Veterans’ Affairs.

During his 40-year legislative
career, Randolph, 82, has been a
champion of a nationwide trans-
portation system and the rights
of the handicapped.

One of Randolph’s brightest
moments occurred in 1971, when
the 26th Amendment to the Con-
stitution was ratified, lowering
the voting age to 18. An advocate
of allowing younger citizens to
vote, Randolph had introduced
similar legislation in the House
of Representatives as early as
1942.

Sen, Biden to open
Friday Ly night SESSION

Sen. Joseph R. Biden
Democrat from Delaware and a
leading foreign policy expert,
will deliver the opening address
at the second session of the Mock
Convention Friday evening.

Biden, 41, has served in the
U.S. Senate longer than over half
of the other 99 members. First
elected in 1972, he was re-elected
in 1978 and serves on four of the
Senate’s most powerful commit-
tees.

Biden is the ranking Democrat
on the Senate Judiciary Commit-
tee, second ranking on the
Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee and third ranking on the

Senate Budget Committee and
the Select Committee on In-
telligence.

Recognized as one of the
Senate’s leading foreign policy
experts, Biden was a leader in
the effort to win Senate ratifica-
tion of the SALT II treaty and is
in the forefront of most foreign
policy debates. Biden also is
chairman of the Senate Demo-
cratic Task Force on Crime.

Biden is a graduate of the
University of Delaware and the

Parade to begin Convention

A parade through downtown
Lexington, speeches by Virginia

_Gov. Charles Robb and four

leading U.S. senators, and the
nomination of presidential and
vice-presidential candidates will
highlight the 18th Mock Conven-
tion this weekend.

Nearly 100 student organizers
have been working for over two
years planning this weekend’s
event, which will begin tomor-
row at 10 a.m. with the tradi-
tional Mock Convention parade.

Each of the 55 state delega-
tions has built a float for the
parade, which will begin at Lex-
ington High School and wind its
way to Main Street, where it will
head north. The parade then will
turn left onto Washington Street
before finishing at the Warner
Center.

In addition to the imaginative
and creative floats, several
bands from area high schools
and some other special attrac-
tions will be featured in the
parade, which is expected to last
about two hours.

The first session of the Mock
Convention will begin at 1 p.m.
tomorrow in the Warner Center.
Following welcoming remarks
by W&L President John D.
Wilson and Lexington Mayor
Charles Phillips, Gov. Charles S.
Robb will deliver a brief ad-
dress.

Sen. Ernest ‘‘Fritz’’ Hollings,
D-S.C., will bring greetings from

the Democratic party to the
Mock Convention. Hollings was
one of the eight Democratic
presidential candidates this year
before withdrawing from the
race after the New Hampshire
primary Feb. 28.

Speeches by Sens. Joseph R.
Biden Jr., D-Del., and Jennings
Randolph, D-W.Va., will open
the second session, beginning
Friday at8 p.m.

Biden, 41, is one of the
Democratic party’s rising
leaders, and Randolph, 82, has
announced his retirement from
the Senate. Randolph’s congres-
sional experience began when he
was elected to the House of
Representatives in 1932 with the
Franklin Roosevelt administra-
tion and the New Deal.

Randolph’s address. will
precede the platform debate Fri-
day evening. A Mock Convention
committee, headed by junior
Scott Tilley, has prepared a plat-
form report similar to the one
the Democrats will debate at
their convention in San Fran-
cisco in July.

Mock Convention delegates
will debate and vote on various
planks of the platform, which
will be a combination of
Democratic stances and student
opinion.

The final session will convene
at9:30a.m. Saturday.

Sen. William Proxmire, D-
Wisc., will deliver the keynote

address that morning. Prox-
mire, noted for his careful
spending of both federal money
and campaign funds, has _ in-
itiated a monthly Washington
tradition with the awarding of
his ‘‘golden fleece’ awards for
the wasting of federal funds.

Following Proxmire’s ad-
dress, the actual nomination
process will begin. Just as at the
real Democratic National Con-
vention this summer, candidates
must be nominated and second-
ed in order to be considered.

When the roll-call voting
begins later that morning, an in-
teresting battle is expected to
develop between former Vice
president Walter Mondale and
Sen. Gary Hart, D-Colo., with
the third remaining candidate,
the Rev. Jesse Jackson, playing
an important role, according to
convention organizers.

Each of the 1,313 mock
delegates will cast three votes,
equaling the 3,939 votes that will
be cast in San Francisco this
summer. When a nominee is
selected by the Mock Conven-
tion, convention organizers hope
to contact him by telephone for
an acceptance speech.

Also Saturday, the delegates
will determine a vice-presiden-
tial nominee, a task first taken
seriously in 1976 with the correct
prediction of Mondale. That final
session is expected to end in the
early to middle afternoon.

All of the events of the Mock
Convention will be open to the
public free of charge.

The history of Washington and
Lee University’s Mock Conven-
tion is an often-told story, but
one whose rich tradition and
record of accuracy make it ripe
for repetition.

Political rhetoric and hoopla,
prominent speakers (including
two presidents — Truman and
Carter), national media
coverage, the death of a vice-
president and in-depth research
resulting in an uncanny record
of accuracy have made the W&L
Mock Convention the best known
and most widely respected col-
legiate political extravaganza in
the nation.

The visit of presidential can-
didate William Jennings Bryan
in 1908 gave occasion to the first
Mock Convention, which not sur-
prisingly nominated Bryan.
That convention was marked by
the only floor fights (in the
literal sense of the word) in con-
vention history, as supporters of
Governor John A. Johnson of
Minnesota became over-zealous
and invited the Bryan sup-
porters outside.

After the brawl the convention
continued, and thus began its
record of accuracy. The Lex-
ington Gazette reported after
that first convention that ‘‘the
young gentlemen entered into
the meeting with the zest of
seasoned politicians plus the en-
thusiasm of collegians.”’

The students missed in 1912,
when they nominated Ohio
governor Judson Harmon over
Woodrow Wilson, but they did
not miss again until 1936. In 1924

the convention accomplished its

most amazing feat.

Heated debate that year over a
“wet”? plank in the platform
(these were the days of Prohibi-
tion) carried over into a heated
battle for the Democratic nomi-
nation. Thirteen candidates

were nominated, and a heated
and frustrating debate ensued.
After the 22nd ballot, the north-
eastern states united behind
W&L graduate John W. Davis,
West Virginia’s favorite-son can-
didate. The ‘‘dry’’ states of Tex-
as, Ohio and Connecticut walked
out, but upon their return Davis
was nominated on the 24th
ballot.

That summer in New York Ci-
ty, the Democrats were dead-
locked for 103 ballots before a
compromise candidate was
chosen: John W. Davis. The
band struck up “The W&L Sw-
ing,’’ which became Davis’ cam-

paign theme song.
The convention went through a
dark spell from 1936-1948,

predicting incorrectly in three of

the four conventions in that —

period. In 1936 the students turn-
ed down the eventual candidate,

 

ie

3 vidas eo : - 7 : ] | y j
is

Alf Landon, for Michigan Sen.
Arthur Vandenburg. Oregon
Sen. Charles McNary was
selected in 1940 rather than the
correct choice, Wendell Wilkie,
and in 1948 W&L again went for
Vandenberg, although Thomas
Dewey would eventually get the
nod.

Since 1948, though, the Mock
Convention has been wrong only
once, in 1972. In that year the
eventual ‘‘real’’ nominee,
George McGovern, was only 25
4 votes short of the necessary
1,509 after the third ballot, but
his support waned and, as he fell
into a deadlock with Hubert
Humphrey, the convention tried
to repeat its 1924 magic with
another compromise candidate,
Edward Kennedy. This time it
was not as fortunate, as
McGovern went on to win the
California and New York

1968—cangsters pass in front of R.E. Lee Episcopal Church.

A rich history of rhetoric, speakers, hoopla and a record of accuracy

primaries to sew up the real
nomination.

Brilliant research paid off in
1952, when the convention was
deadlocked between World War
II hero Dwight Eisenhower and
Sen. Robert Taft. After three
ballots Taft led Eisenhower, and
California Governor Earl War-
ren was a distant third. The
California chairman at the con-
vention had been in touch with
Warren and received a wire
after the third ballot to swing his
support to Eisenhower, who won
the nomination. Warren was
thanked by being given the vice-
presidential bid.

Two presidents have keynoted
conventions: Harry S. Truman
in 1960 and then-Governor Jim-
my Carter in 1972. 1964 can-
didate Barry Goldwater was the
keynoter at the 1980 Mock Con-
vention, but the most dramatic

speech of all occurred in 1956,
when the entire nation turned its
eye to this small college com-
munity.

Former Vice President Alben
Barkley keynoted the convention
that year, and his fiery oratory
prowess had fired the student
delegates up. As his speech
reached a stormy climax, he
screamed, ‘‘I would rather be a
servant in the house of the Lord
than to sit in the seats of the
mighty’’ — and fell dead of a
heart attack.

‘‘You have’ unfinished
business,’ Mrs. Barkley re-
minded the convention, and it
convened one week later to
nominate Adlai Stevenson.

Seventy-six years of history
and tradition are on the line in
1984 — a tough tradition to try to
live up to.

Since 1912, Latture’s been there

92-year-old professor snseritus has supported Wilson, FDR, Truman

By NELSON PATTERSON
Staff Reporter

There are a few landmarks at
Washington and Lee. The Colon-
nade, Lee Chapel and Lee House
come to mind. And don’t forget
Professor Emeritus Rupert N.
Latture, a walking and talking
fount of knowledge about W&L.

For Latture, remembering the
1912 Mock Democratic Conven-
tion isn’t very difficult. His
knowledge of the event, how-
ever, doesn’t come from books
but from first-hand experience.
Latture was a student at the
time, and like most students at
the second Mock Convention he
just did what he was told.

“I was just present and
voted,”’ he said, adding with a
glint in his 92-year-old eyes, ‘‘I
was a (Woodrow) Wilson man.
Stillam.”

Even the 1916 Republican
Mock Convention stands clearly

.

in Latture’s mind.

“In 1916 I was working for my
M.A. degree,’’ Latture noted. ‘‘I
was chairman of the Tennessee
delegation that year. Had about
15 guys on that delegation, quite
a few when you consider we had
a little less than 600 students
here at the time.

“Let’s see. In 1911, we had 636
students, I believe, when I
entered. That hadn’t increased
much after 1911-1912. It decreas-
ed up until the first World War
and then came back up after the
war.”

Then there’s the 1924 conven-
tion. (Latture was quick to note
that there were no conventions
in 1920 or 1944, due to the wars).

In 1924, we nominated John W.
Davis. I was adviser to the con-
vention that year. Everybody
was surprised. The contest had
been between (Alfred) Smith
and (William) McAdoo. At the
time we needed two-thirds vote

of the delegates to nominate. It
was a real battle between those
two,”’ he said. ‘‘Of course, the
most amazing thing was that we
nominated Davis first. Nobody
expected it.”’

‘1932 was certainly important
for us also. We nominated FDR.
Then he was nominated in
Chicago three weeks afterward.
I attended the convention in
Chicago that year, quite a battle
it was. A.W. Robertson, the
Senator from Virginia, got me
tickets.

“Dr. (Frances) Gaines was
President (of the University) in
1932. His brother-in-law, a law
student named Cavat Robert,
nominated Roosevelt. He was
chairman of the New York
delegation. He now speaks
before large groups as a profes-
sion and says he discovered his
talents for speaking to audiences
while nominating FDR for the
convention in ’32,’’ he said.

His conversation slowly mov-
ed back to his experiences at the
Chicago National Democratic
Convention, (including) hearing
Roosevelt accept the nomina-
tion. This was the first time a
Presidential candidate ever ad-
dressed the nominating conven-
tion.

“In the 1932 convention, Mr.
Roosevelt flew to Chicago to ac-
cept the nomination. I was sit-
ting about as close to him as the
wall over there,’’ he noted, point-

€

17 S. Main St.

ing to a wall about 12 feet away.
“TI was in the balcony above the
podium.”

“I remember two or three
things about the 1932 convention.
One was the Chicago delegation.
They were afraid Roosevelt
wasn’t wet enough. They were
afraid he couldn’t get enough
money or that he would push for
more liquor, hard liquor. I saw
Al Smith. Saw Huey Long but
didn’t speak to him.

“At the last meeting of the
convention, we found out
Roosevelt was coming to town.
So they decided on an additional
session. I didn’t have a ticket to
it. Hadn’t anticipated it. I was
staying at the Steven’s Hotel in
Chicago, and when the New
York delegation came into the
lobby, I walked up to one of them
and asked where I might get a
ticket. One guy said, ‘Here. Take
the damn ticket.’ He was mad Al
Smith hadn’t been nominated. So
I got to hear Roosevelt,” he said.

Roosevelt wasn’t the only
president whom Latture
remembers readily. He recalls
Harry Truman’s visit to the 1960
Mock Convention and _then-
Georgia Governor Jimmy
Carter’s address to the 1972 con-
vention.

“TI remember Harry Trumea
very well. He and Dr. Gaines sat
out and watched the parade on
the lawn between the Presi-
dent’s house and (R.E, Lee)

Episcopal,’’ Latture said. “I
didn’t have much contact with
him. Just shook hands.”’

“In 1972, Carter left a
favorable impression on the con-
vention. A fine man,”’ he said.

The convention that made the
biggest news was the 1956 con-
vention, when former Vice
President Alben Barkley. died
after finishing his adress to the
convention.

“TI was sitting as close as the
door to Barkley,’’ said Latture,
pointing to a door about 12 feet
away. ‘‘He had said his famous
statement — ‘I would rather bea
servant in the house of the Lord
than sit in the seats of the
mighty’ — and then stepped
back. He was standing on a plat-
form on the podium and there
were ribbons around the edge. I
thought he had fallen when ac-
tually he had died. In a few
moments, we realized he had
dropped dead. He fell right at
Mrs. Barkley’s feet. Some
photographer tried to take his
picture as he lay there. Dr.
Gaines didn’t think that was too
appropriate and didn’t allow it.
Of course, Mrs. Barkley insisted
they continue the convention,
though they stopped the conven-
tion for a few days,’’ he said.
“We went on to nominate
(Adlai) Stevenson.”

Will Latture attend this
weekend’s convention, his 17th
and the University’s 18th Mock
Convention?

“Oh, I guess I’ll take a look in.
I’ve seen every convention since
the first one in 1912. Only missed
the 1908 convention,’ he said,
chuckling.

After all, he’s only one shy of
perfect attendance.

Convention

finances in
good shape

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

With $95,333 raised as of Mon-
day, the W&L Mock Democratic
Convention should reach _ its
fund-raising goal of $102,500 this
week, according to Treasurer
Michael Shelton.

“This week memorabilia
(went) on sale. We ought to see
our goal reached if not surpass-
ed,’’ Shelton said.

Shelton said that the $95,333
raised so far represents 93 per-
cent of the total budget. The
Mock Convention has_ spent
$48,000 so far. Shelton said the
Mock Convention expected to
make $10,000 from the sale of
memorabilia this week.

Shelton said that as the con-
vention approached, the pace of
contributions and expenditures
increased. As evidence, Shelton
reported that between April 18
and May 3 the Mock Convention
raised $3,548 and spent $17,460.

State committees should begin
spending a large amount of their
money this week, as they begin
construction of floats, Shelton
said. State committees are allot-
ted $20,000 of the total budget,
and the 13 committees and the
reserve fund of the Mock Con-
vention are allocated the re-
maining $82,500, Shelton explain-
ed

‘We hope to leave a little nest
egg for the next convention,”’ he
said, anticipating a small
surplus.

Shelton said a large part of the
convention’s success in fund
raising was due to a $25,000 bond
the Hatton Sumners’ Foundation
gave the Mock Convention.
Shelton said the bond has bee

earning interest since shortly
after the 1980 convention, when

the Sumners’ Foundation made .

the contribution.

The Sumners’ Foundation also
gave the University a $100,000
endowment, from which the
Mock Convention has received
$14,000 in earnings on the in-
terest, Shelton said.

Believing that businesses
would also be willing to donate
money to the Mock Convention,
Shelton said that early fund-
raising attempts were directed
at companies and banks. How-
ever, response from business
was “‘zilch,’’ Shelton said.

Consequently, in November
the Mock Convention began
sending out requests for dona-
tions to alumni, parents and
relatives of students. The
response from this campaign
was tremendous Shelton said.

‘‘We had a list of every parent
of the University. We contacted
friends and family. We were
very surprised with the re-
sponse, he said.

Shelton said the state commit-
tees also have been successful in
raising funds. The states have
almost reached their $25,000
goal, of which $5,000 went to the
Mock Convention in _ taxes,
Shelton added.

“States from all around the
country have been able to raise
money. Many delegates will ap-
proach their family and
friends,’’ Shelton said, explain-
ing why states like California,
with large delegations but few
students at W&L, have been able
to raise funds.

Shelton said that the Mock
Convention’s fund-raising ef-
forts would have been aided if

the staff of the previous Mock
Convention had left records of
their fund-raising efforts.

“When we came in we had no
records of the previous conven-
tion’s progress. It would have
been helpful to understand how
they raised funds.”’

“This convention will leave ex-
cellent records. The two
chairmen have done a study on
the progress of the convention,”
he added.

Shelton said that the fund-
raising efforts have been tedious
at times but that he has enjoyed
it.

‘Hopefully, this convention
will be a weekend when every-
one will learn something about
the political process, and a suc-
cessful budget will enhance the
prospects for that,’’ he com-
mented.

Fatal Fiji

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

“ARSON: REWARD”’ signs
were posted outside the charred
remains of the Phi Gamma Del-
ta fraternity house this week,
following the announcement by
investigators that last month’s
fatal fire was set intentionally.

Lexington Police Chief L.O.
Sutton said at a Monday news
conference that the blaze was
started by a substance “‘of a
petroleum nature, probably
gasoline.’ He said that police
have some possible suspects and
motives, but that no charges
have been filed.

‘At this time we will say that,
as a result of laboratory tests,
the total circumstances of the
fire and the physical evidence,
we have now determined that
the fire was originated by ar-
son,”’ Sutton said.

Sutton said after the news con-
ference that the laboratory tests
included samples of debris and
fluids taken from the scene of
the fire.

He said it is likely that some-
one arrested in connection with
the case would be charged

The three-story house was gut-
ted by a pre-dawn blaze on April
11, when most Washington and

break.

The victim, sophomore
Thomas J. Fellin, was the only
occupant of the main house when
the fire broke out. The honor stu-
dent and co-president of the
fraternity apparently died of
smoke inhalation.

“This fire was of particular
significance in property damage

‘‘We are looking in several dif-

Sutton said the unusual

Grand jury disbands

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

The special grand jury in-
vestigating local drug traffick-
ing has completed seven months
of work by submitting a report
containing recommendations for
indictments to Rockbridge Coun-
ty Circuit Court Judge George F.
Honts III.

The report is still sealed.
Honts said he received the
report last Thursday but has not
yet determined what action will
be taken.

A special grand jury has broad
subpoena and _ investigative
powers, but cannot issue indict-
ments. It provides recommenda-
tions to the regular grand jury,
which met May 7 and can be re-

‘onvened at any time. ‘‘They
y be called back ina relative

ly short time, and they may
not,”’ the judge said.

Honts said he had given the
report an initial reading, but had
not yet studied it in detail. ‘‘It
waS a sweeping investigation,
and once they got started, the
jurors were a pretty dedicated
bunch from what I’ve gleaned,”’
he said.

“They were required to
specify in the report any indict-
ments which they felt were ap-
propriate, and they have met
that requirement,” he said.

\ccording to Honts, the
report, which is ‘“‘not over-
whelming in length,”’ contains a
first section of indictment
recommendations, and ‘‘three or
four sections which deal with
other matters.’

The judge said that ‘“‘as a

word ‘‘expelled’’ on a student’s

Jenevein said he decided to
withdraw the motion to lower the
number of votes needed to con-
vict someone in an open trial
from eight to five after discuss-
ing the matter with alumni and
trustees. No other members of
the EC, which had given pre-
liminary approval to the
measure by a 5-2 vote last week,
objected to Jenevein’s decision.

Nevertheless, Senior Law
Representative Jim Green read
into the record a letter from the
Student Bar Association also op-
posing the five-vote proposal.

“This proposal not only
tramples the accused’s due pro-
cess rights, but also under this
system, one can imagine the en-
suing civil suits which will tear
at the fabric of Washington and
Lee’s honor system,’’ the letter
charged.

The letter said that if the five
vote proposal were approved,
SBA participation in the future
open hearings was ‘‘questiona

Werner claims fourth
shutout as soccer splits two

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

Sophomore forward Bill
Holmes scored a goal in each
game this week as the Gener-
als’ soccer team split two away
games, defeating Catholic
University, 3-0, on Saturday,
and losing in overtime, 3-2, to
Radford University on Tues-
day.

The victory over Catholic
ended the ODAC season for the
Generals, who finished at 3-3 in
the conference. Lynchburg Col-
lege, which defeated W&L, 2-1,
on Oct. 19, took the ODAC title
witha 5-1 record.

Tuesday’s defeat at Radford
left W&L with a 7-5 record with
one game remaining, a 10:00
a.m. match this Saturday
against Emory University on
Wilson Field.

Although the Generals failed
to capture the ODAC title, head
coach Rolf Piranian is happy

-with the way his team has

developed this season. “‘As a
team we’ve improved, clearly.
We’ve scored more goals and
played better defense,”’ said the
eighth-year coach.

Holmes, Gary Clements, and
freshman Ken Randby scored
the goals against Catholic. The
shutout was the fourth of the
season for junior goalie Jay
Werner, who has a 1.33 goals
against average per game. The
W&L shutout record is seven in
a season and 11 ina career.

Against Radford Holmes and
Steve McGrath gave the Gener-
als a 2-) lead, which they held
going into the final two minutes.
Radford scored with 1:39 left,
however, to send the game into
overtime, then ended the game
seven minutes into the first
overtime with the winning goal.

Holmes now has five goals
and seven assists on the season,
for 17 total points. Senior co-
captain Roland Simon, with six
goals and four assists, has 16
points.

 

An Open Letter from
Lloyd’s of Lexington

Dear Washington & Lee Students:
When we opened our restaurant 3 years ago, we did so hoping

 

that Lloyd’s would become a popular place for students to come
with their friends for a quick meal. We added the most popular
video games in the country to provide a little entertainment in a
conservative town that lacks a lot in the entertainment field.
You have been good to use.

In the past 12 months, Dominos and Arby’s have entered into
the fast food market and sliced the pie. There are only so many
dollars to be spent on food.

One thing that is unique about our ‘‘Lloyd’s of Lexington,”’ is
that the owner works and manages his store, which keeps him in.
touch with the needs of the community. We have responded to
the needs of you students by operating 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week. But, with this, we have excess overhead to pay.

I can tell you that we have tried for the past 3 years to provide
a quality product, with fast, courteous service, in a clean
restaurant. Some businesses would have you to believe that your
business does not matter. Let me be the first to say, if it were not
for Washington and Lee students, Lloyd’s of Lexington would
not survive. ;

We will continue to provide specials to build business. We hope
you will take advantage of these specials, as you could save
some money.

We will be purchasing two of the latest new ‘‘laser disc’’ video
games next week, Dragon’s Lair, and Mach III. These games
are intense. Come by and let them blow your mind.

Please friends, think twice before spending your money in
chain food stores. Your money will be invested back into this
business, to better it, which will benefit you in the long run. As
we celebrate our 3rd anniversary, I would like say thank you; a
million thank you’s for making Lloyd’s better today than yester-
day. Help us make it better tomorrow than it is today.

Respectfully,
Lloyd W. Smith Jr.

Geraldine Ferraro — The Fox of Flatbush

NY Congresswoman suggested as viable contender in Democratic V-P nomination race

By NELSON PATTERSON
Staff Reporter

Everyone knew the names of
Mondale, Hart and Jackson for
the number one spot on the
Democratic ticket, but who is
the “Fox from Flatbush” and
who is Senator Lloyd Bensten
(?), Bentson (?), Bentsen (7?) —
whatever?

The Mock Democrats found

Analysis

SARS RE
nominating for the vice-pres-
ident spot a bit tougher to
predict this past Saturday, but
by most standards their choice
was a wise one.

“It was a good choice. It was a
realistic choice. Since the pur-
pose of the Mock Convention is to
be as accurate as possible, it
succeeded,’’ said politics pro-
fessor Milton Colvin, himself
nominated by the Montana
delegation to head the ticket.

Realism aside, the race for the
number two spot on the ticket is
for most political spectators the
real race. Everyone from New
York Governor Mario Cuomo to
House Speaker Tip O’Neill (they
both favor Congresswoman
Geraldine Ferraro of New York,
the aforementioned ‘‘Fox from
Flatbush’) to Richard Nixon
and Atlanta Mayor Andrew
Young (who see a Mondale-Hart
ticket as both a unifying move
and a tough ticket) calls the

____Letters

cards differently. Many factors
must be weighed.

Consider the constituencies
the Democratic candidates have
counted within the past year.
Last fall the National Organiza-
tion of Women (NOW) called the
then-eight candidates before He
board to examine and Cross-
examine them. At least two can-
didates emerged pledged pledg-
ing a woman as vice-president if
nominated. Two others — the
two frontrunners today, Mon-
dale and Hart — pledged to
“seriously consider’’ a woman in
the second spot. So, women are
placated by having a Ferraro-
type placed on the ticket.

Or are they? Richard Nixon, in
his magical reappearing act,
noted rather astutely last week,
‘A woman on the Democratic
ticket would not help because the
activist-type women who would
change their vote for president
because a woman was on the
ticket are already for Mondale
and against Reagan. So he’s not
going to pick a woman. He’s go-
ing to take either (Texas Sen.
Lloyd) Bentsen or (Gary)
Hart.”

Nixon’s remark illustrates two
very important considerations
on presidential/vice-
presidential pairings: regional
balance and political balance.
Mondale, seen as a career politi-
cian and as a Minnesotan, needs
a running mate from the South
or West, hence Bentson or Hart.
Ideologically, Mondale is a

liberal in the best sense of
Humphrey and Johnson, '
Bentsen is seen as toeing a
careful line between the
mainstream Democrats and the
‘“‘Dixiecrats’’ or conservatives;
Hart has the voting record of a
liberal but the image of a neo-
conservative for many political
commentators.

Considering Ferraro, there-
fore, really challenged the
preceding three fundamentals of
“presidential pairings.’”’ Her
New York background would at-
tract few voters in the South or
West; her liberal record makes
Mondale’s promises pale in com-
parison.

“T see Ferraro as liberal,’
Colvin said. ‘“You can’t put two
liberals on the same ticket. Any
woman will be perceived as a
liberal.’’

Nixon comes to the same con-
clusion but through different
logic. With regard to the
thoughts going through Mon-
dale’s mind as he settles on a
running mate, Nixon noted: ‘‘He
will bow toward the women, say
he’s considering one, will inter-
view them, and so forth, and will
not take one. The reason he will
not take one is not because he
doesn’t like (them), and not
because he doesn’t think they’re
qualified, (but) because he
thinks a woman on the ticket
isn’t going to help him. And it
wouldn’t.”’

“Hey, listen, it’s very heady
stuff,” Ferraro said in a recent
interview. “But I know full well

 

To the Editors:

You’d be hard pressed to find a
member of the Washington and
Lee community who does not
know what I look like, or how I
stand on the issue of coeduca-
tion, but this is not a letter extoll-
ing the advantages of an educa-
tion in a coeducational environ-
ment, so please don’t turn
straight to the Eat Beat, read a
little further.

Statistics indicate that I
disagree with roughly 60 percent
of the student body on a certain
issue. Anyone who knows me
will tell you that this is fine with
me. You see, I’ve examined the
points made by various people,
considered my own view, and
formed an opinion of my own,
subject to change. Now, when I
walk down the street, I often en-
counter those who possess an op-
posing opinion. The arguments
that they most often present in
their favor include: ‘‘Go to Hell,
Whitehead!” and, ‘‘You’re a ---
ing goose!” Some have asked
me, “Why don’t you ----ing leave
if you don’t like it the way it is?”
but they rarely stick around long
enough for an answer. You see
these statements are usually

made from moving autos or the

 

windows of buildings.

Not once has someone ap-
proached me and said, “I sup-
port the status quo because...”
I’ve approached a few people
who disagree with my opinion,
and it generally leads to a con-
structive argument, in a calm
tone of voice, and, I confess, I’ve
heard some good points in their
favor.

Gentlemen, and ladies, the sad
part of it all remains, many
would rather simply shut me up,
or chase me out, than allow me
toexpress my opinions. Now this
is still an institute of higher
education, dedicated to the
liberal arts. For it to succeed,
there must be a high level of free
thought, free expression and
listening. It’s been said that the
mark of a superior intelligence
is the ability to entertain two op-
posing thoughts in the mind at
the same time. I wish to propose
the following thought to my
fellow students: learn to listen.
When you can listen to what the
other person has to say, you will
be certain to learn something, if
only the weakness of their argu-
ment.

I close with my thanks to the
Mock Convention and its Steer-

Opinions and learning to listen

ing Committee for shutting me
up. Their simple act of censor-
ship brought my cause even
more favorable media attention
than I had hoped for. I wish them

more prevalent. Then, the IFC
could have taken a longer look at
its new calendar and truly deter-
mined whether or not it solves
old problems or creates new
ones. I strongly believe that the
latter will ensue.

Thus, I urge students, first to
recognize their UC reps for next
year and demand of them not on-
ly obligatory attendance but also
voicing opinions of the various
classes. In this way, the UC, an
important forum of discussion
between students, faculty and
administrators, will be certainly
efficient and effective.

th only reason I’m on the short

t is because I’m a woman.”

In agreement is San Francisco
Mayor Diane Feinstein, another
oft-mentioned running mate for
Mondale.

“I think there is a good deal of
mouthing going on about a
woman veep,” Feinstein said
recently, adding that Demo-
cratic officials are not as open to
the idea as they sound.

All the arguments and reason-
ing against a woman make Hart
and Bentsen look all the more
likely. Some argue that Hart’s
real ambitions are for 1988, and
taking the number two spot on a
Mondale ticket gives him the
enigma of a loser or ‘‘fuddy-
duddy with a union label,’’ which
he won’t want in 1988. For uni-
ty’s sake, however, a Mondale-
Hart ticket would mean the
Democratic party could survive.

‘“‘In my view Hart would help
Mondale more than Bentsen,”
Nixon noted, ‘because he
reaches a broader constituency
in some of the critical states.”

But is it sane to expect a
Mondale-Hart ticket?

‘Well, they do have a capabili-
ty — on the Democratic side par-
ticularly — to get together. If
Johnson and Kennedy could get
together, I think they, too, could
get together,’’ Nixon said’ well
aware of the potency of the
Democratic ticket in 1960. ‘‘And
that would be a strong ticket.”’

Where does Bentsen fit into the
picture, especially since the

W&L Mock Convention drafted
him?

“Mondale has got to make a
decision as to how important
Texas is to him,” Nixon said,
“Bentsen...would help him in
Texas and Texas is a critical
state. Bentsen, however, would
not help him in other parts of the
country, particularly the Mid-
west. I think for a Mondale
strategy to succeed, he must
also concentrate on winning
states like Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Michigan, Illinois, New York.
And there Bentsen would not
help him and Hart would.”’

What does all this show? Simp-
ly, politics is a complex
business, best left to odds-
makers to set odds and news
commentators to prophesy. It
shows the Mock Convention,
however, was indeed a realistic
exercise where these considera-
tions entered at some point in the
deliberations. Colvin sees that as
helping the authenticity of the
event.

“An interesting challenge was
raised by the nomination of Fer-
raro. It’s the paradox of nomi-
nating a woman at an all-male
school,” he said, noting that
various press reports concurred.
“Really, we had the best of both
worlds. The possible nomination
of a woman increased the
publicity given to the school
while at the same time, by
ultimately nominating Bentsen,
we are closer to what the na-
tional party will do.”’

W&L sparkles
at Mock Con

energy. The months of planning,

My View

AOA TERRE RENE ERROR MERE NTA:
produced a more than over-
whelming result. The entire con-
vention, from the political
research to the parade, demon-
strated the potential of this
place. It is a shame and a
disgrace that so many faculty
thought it not worth their while
to attend — the same faculty
who complain about how
lethargic and apathetic we are.

I saw some faculty faces in the
crowd and some (mostly the
same) at the convention. To
those of you who attended:

Thanks for your support and in-
terest. To those of you who chose
not to: Why? The Mock Conven-
tion is one of the student body’s
opportunities to shine; it seems
that the faculty, of all possible
groups, would want to attend.

I do not say that the conven-
tion, however great it was, ex-
cuses academic and other ex-
tracurricular laziness. The con-
Vention was, however, a (once in
four years) time for the student
body to do something redeem-
ing. And it was spectacular. If
the faculty who are worried
about our seeming worthless-
ness had witnessed the conven-
tion, they would doubtlessly
have had their confidence great-
ly renewed.

The Mock Convention demon-
strated the capabilities of this
place. Perhaps it impressed on
the faculty and administration
who cared enough about us to at-
tend that less than drastic
measures are needed to make
the necessary reforms.

Mock Con exceeds organizers’ expectations

V-P nominee Bentsen says he has ‘ambivalent’ feelings about second spot

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

Relaxing in the Mock Conven-
tion office earlier this week, co-
chairman Peter Muller looked
back at the two days he had been
planning for nearly two years.

“Before you could blink an
eye, it was over,” Muller said.

“I was so impressed by how
the convention actually came to
life and was so pleased with how
it actually ended up,” he added.

When Muller gavelled the con-
vention to a close Saturday at
3:57 p.m., the hard work he, the
other members of the steering
committee and the state chair-
men had done on the convention
had come to an end.

For the record, the convention
nominated former Vice Presi-
dent Walter F. Mondale on the
first ballot to be the Democratic
presidential nominee. Mondale
received 664 votes, seven more
than he needed, to 496 votes for
Sen. Gary Hart, D-Colo., and 133
votes for the Rev. Jesse L.
Jackson.

The vice-presidential voting, a
little more exciting, went to the
second ballot before Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas, edged out

"JUST T0 BE THERE"

110 S. Jefferson St - Lexington, VA + (703) 463-3338

 

Rep. Geraldine Ferraro, D-N.Y.
Bentsen needed 17 votes from
the Colorado delegation, which
previously had supported Hart,
to go over the top with 666 votes
to 606 for Ferraro and 40 for Hart
before both California and New
York, a total of 210 votes, switch-
ed from Ferraro to Bentsen.

Bentsen said in a telephone in-
terview yesterday that he had
read about his mock nomination
in The Washington Post. “‘I en-
joyed it. I thought it was fun, and
I enjoyed the speculation,’’ he
added.

Asked whether he was in-
terested in being the vice-
presidential nominee for Mon-
dale, whom he supports, Bentsen
said, “The country could do
worse, and probably will. I have
not sought it and am not doing
anything at all in the way of
seeking it.”

“When one’s name surfaces
this early, reporters go to great
lengths to figure out why that
person should not get (the vice-
presidential nomination), and
someone else comes along,”
Bentsen added.

Bentsen said he had ‘am-
bivalent’ feelings about the
vice-presidential spot, noting

 

that Hubert Humphrey and Lyn-
don Johnson were ‘‘unhappy’”’ in
that role, while Mondale seemed
to have ‘‘a decent working rela-

Bentsen added that serious con-
sideration also should be given
to a woman for the vice-pres-
idential nominee.

Bentsen said he agrees with
the Mock Convention’s selection
of Mondale on the first ballot,
and he said he expects the real
Democrats to do the same in San
Francisco. The four members of
the Senate who spoke at the
Mock Convention this weekend
‘“‘were impressed and, frankly,
amazed at the amount of work
and effort that obviously went in-

to the convention,’’ Bentsen add-
ed.

Each of the delegates at the
Mock Convention represented
three votes that will be cast at
the real Democratic National
Convention July 16-19 in San
Francisco.

Other highlights of the Mock
Convention, which has correctly
forecast the presidential nom-
inee of the party out of the White
House 12 times in 17 attempts
since 1908, included speeches by
Virginia Gov. Charles S. Robb
and four United States Senators.

A portion of the platform
debate, scheduled for Friday
evening, had to be postponed to
Saturday morning because of a

Faculty may revote on

diploma for Dederick

A special faculty meeting may
be called to reconsider the deci-
sion to award a diploma to
William L. Dederick, a former
Washington and Lee student who
has been convicted of drug
charges.

The faculty voted last week
that a degree should be issued to
Dederick, who had completed
his. graduation requirements
when he was arrested last May
on charges of sale and posses-
sion of cocaine and possession of
marijuana with intent to dis-
tribute.

“I have had a formal request
from a faculty member that the
matter be reconsidered,’’ Presi-
dent John D. Wilson said yester-
day.

“‘T think frankly that there will

be another vote on that question
so that everyone will have a
chance to consider any addi-
tional information that may
become available,”’ he said.

Wilson said he was scheduled
to meet today with the faculty
member making the request. He
said that after the meeting he
would confer with Dean of
Students Lewis G. John, who is
chairman of the Student Affairs
Committee, which suspended
Dederick from W&L for this
academic year.

The next regularly-scheduled
faculty meeting is the day before
Commencement. Faculty sourc-
es said that if another vote were
taken on the Dederick matter, it
would likely be scheduled for
early next week.

lack of a quorum Friday night.

That was one of only a few pro-
blems with the Mock Conven-
tion, though, Muller said.

He also cited the failures of
Mondale to make an acceptance
speech (Tad Devine, Mondale’s
chairmen of delegate selection,
filled in for him) and of the
scoreboard to work as minor
problems.

“Overall, everyone I talked to
seemed to be very pleased,”
Muller said. ‘‘It exceeded all my
expectations. Everything seem-
ed to flow so well, and the con-
vention itself wasn’t just a
tedious schedule of events; it
seemed to come alive.”’

Muller added that he was
pleased with the conservatively-
oriented delegates’ reaction to
the speakers, the platform and
the actual nomination and roll-
call voting process.

“The students did a good job of
playing Democratic,’ Muller
said. “Their enthusiasm grew
and grew. I think it pinnacled
with the  vice-presidential
nomination. ”’

Special to the Phi

Archaeology, excavation, ar-
tifacts. The mere mention of the
‘words leads one to conjure up
images of old men with pipes on
a quest to find missing treasures
buried deep beneath the deserts
of northern Africa or valuable
objects hidden in the ancient
ruins of the Aztecs, or the tomb
of Calcutta. Most other people
—people who have not patroniz-
ed the movies from Hollywood
excessively — may even dream
up images of old valuable ar-
tifacts being proudly displayed
in glass cases set up by the ar-
chaeologist, to be gazed upon by
all for posterity. But these im-
ages, as common as they may
be, are inaccurate, especially to
the students of Professor John
McDaniel’s 377 archaeology /an-
thropology field course, who are
in the midst of an extensive ex-
cavation in the High Hollows
below House Mountain, about
seven miles west of Lexington.

It’s 8:45 a.m., and while most
students are deliberating
whether to hit B period, students
taking ‘‘the dig’’ (as it is com-
monly called) find themselves
on their usual morning trek, car-
rying tools and other necessities
up an old, rugged path to sites
44RB143 and 44RB144. The
students are working on a dwell-
ing site, as well as a suspected
sawmill site located in the High
Hollows.

Arriving at the sites, students
split into their respective
groups. The smaller group will
travel an additional 100 yards to
the sawmill site, located off what
is believed to have been a log-
ging road.

Students work in trenches
about three by five feet with
usually two students to a trench.
Everything from leaves to com-
mon soil must come out of the
trench and be placed in a
separate pile commonly known
as a spoils pile.

“It is critical that the soil from
any one trench be distinguished
from other soil,” said Tim
Williamson. ‘‘Our whole purpose
out here is to map and record ac-
curately; if we fail then we’ve

Sprunt)

undermined the entire project.”

“An artifact’s worth to the an-
thropologist,”’ he continued, ‘‘is
based on its relative position to
other artifacts and features.”

Although the sawmill site has
produced few artifacts, it has
provided clues as to the nature of
economic activity the early in-
habitants engaged in.

“T’m really enjoying myself
out there,’’ said Jeff Sindler, a
freshman working on the site,
“Although we are not finding
many artifacts on the site, we’re
getting an idea of what an early
sawmill looked like.”’

As Jim Worthington, a fresh-
man working on the site, con-
tends, the sawmill site ‘‘obvious-
ly indicates that there was an
outside market for at least
lumber if not many other pro-
ducts.”

Although few artifacts may
exist, features in the soil, such as
coloration or texture, or holes
left by posts, can provide clues

 

yr

as well.

“The frequent anomalies in
the soil indicate that a sawmill
site existed here; for example,
certain patches of what appear
to be sawdust or ash have been
found,” said Denny Samuel,
another freshman working on
the site.

Unlike the sawmill site, the
larger site, believed to have
been a domestic dwelling, has
provided an abundant supply of
artifacts.

“‘We’ve been finding charcoal
pieces, horseshoes...and tobacco
tins,’’ said one student.

Another student described the
many types of ceramic that he
and his trench partner had
discovered. ‘From what we
have found, there are many
types of ceramics which indicate
that economic isolation was not
as common in these areas as was
originally thought.”

A second major aspect of the
excavation process takes place

in the lab. Students in the course
usually spend one day of the
week in the lab, analyzing ar-
tifacts and computing data.

“The lab lets us clean
everything, process it, and helps
determine dating,’ said Wes
Payne, a junior who supervises
the lab. ‘‘Also it helps us under-
stand mundane factors that
would otherwise not be known,
such as dietary consumption,
what types of utensils were used,
etc...,” he said.

“The process starts by
washing and cleaning the ar-
tifacts,” he continued. ‘‘They
are more accurately classi-
fied...into class and sub-class.
This helps to date the artifact.

and the site.”’

This data is then placed onto a
computer sheet and ultimately
stored in the computer, with the
artifact also being stored in an
accessible location if further
testing is desired.

But what are the overall im-
plications of the project? Pro-
fessor John McDaniel, who
heads the project along with Jim
Adams in the field, addressed
this question.

“Many oral histories and
reports suggest that these areas
were inhabited in the 18th cen-
tury.... We have found that this
is not the case.”’

‘‘Additionally,’’ he said, ‘‘we
are confident that we can use ex-
isting sawmill sites to compare
against the one that we are
presently excavating.”’

Archaeology provides the in-
formation that historians can-
not, due to the many inac-
curacies and sensationalism of
many local histories, McDaniel
said.

But at the same time
McDaniel notes that these inac-
curate histories are not meant to
be intentionally deceiving.
‘“‘When obtaining oral histories
from local residents we con-
tinually find that people want to
impress us with interesting facts
about their ancestors. Unfor-
tunately, the stories have been
around so long that they begin to
seep into local histories and
documents. This presents a real
problem for the historian.”

Inhabitants of the High
Hollows areas left no docu-
ments, McDaniel said.

An example of the value of ar-
chaeological field research can
be crystallized by Wes Payne. ‘‘I
remember when we were ex-
cavating the Liberty Hall site,
we found a map of the building
which had not been previously
known to exist. It gave us an idea
of what Liberty Hall actually
looked like.”

Estelle’s - a good alternative

One of the
hottest, quickest,

tastiest meals

in Lexington

By EDDIE CURRAN
Staff Reporter

Estelle’s Diner, on Randolph
Street next to the back entrance
of Leggett’s Department Store,
is at first glance easily dismiss-
ed. Because, let’s face _ it,
Estelle’s is not pretty. The type
of person who would go in
without ever having heard of
Estelle’s is either the pool-
playing, shower-a-week type, or
the adventuresome fellow who
does wild and crazy things spon-
taneously. But, just as you
shouldn’t do with blind dates
with great personalities, don’t
judge Estelle’s (the book) by its
appearance (the cover).

For at Estelle’s, one can get
one of the hottest, quickest,
squarest, tastiest meals in town.
Every day they have a choice of
two specials, both for $2.25. For
instance, country fried steak,
mashed potatoes, gravy, green
beans, rolls, iced tea or coffee,

and a piece of chocolate cake. It
comes piping hot within five
minutes and tastes home-
cooked, or better in my case
(just kidding, Momma). The
country fried steak was crunchy
on the outside, tender inside, and
covered with enough thick
brown gravy to have some left
over to dip the rolls into. The
mashed potatoes had just

Oar
The
Eat Beat

enough lumps to give them a
potato-like taste and texture, as
opposed to the gluey, maximum-
blend variety, which I don’t like.
The green beans seemed fresh,
not canned, and had little chunks
of ham in them. The cake was
good as well, with a thick layer
of chocolate icing. The only thing
I didn’t like was the iced tea,
because it was pre-sweetened.

Judging from the other time I
had the special, which was
turkey and dressing with rice
and gravy and green beans, the
$2.25 specials at Estelle’s are
always dependable and a good
alternative.

Estelle’s also has
cheeseburgers, foot-long hot
dogs, fried chicken, chicken

burgers, etc. I heard good things
about the cheeseburger, and
while it was good, the best things

about it were its price, a dollar,
and its good size.

Not just a place to eat dinner,
Estelle’s is the only place I know
of in Lexington where you can
play pool and drink beer at the
same time. The beer is cold and
inexpensive, and the pool tables
(there are two) aren’t missing a
single ball.

In the not-that-it-really-
matters-but-I-thought-I’d-
mention-it-anyway department,
Estelle’s is something of a VMI
hangout. Near the entrance, for
instance, there is a Confederate
flag with the words, ‘“‘VMI-
Never Say Die.”’ In fact, Estelle,
who I assume owns and who I
know runs Estelle’s, seems to
know most of the VMI students
(veemee’s is much easier), and
is maybe something of a sur-
rogate mother to them. My only
complaint with the veemees was
their jukebox selections, ‘‘Cum
on Feel the Noize” and a country

music adaptation of ‘‘Where’s
the Beef?”’

So if you’re down on your luck,
you don’t have much cash, and
you want a square meal or a
game of pool, head over to
Estelle’s. The hot meal, the
country music, the posters of kit-
tens with slogans like, ‘‘I think I
need a hug’’ and ‘‘Mama told me
there’d be days like this,’’ might
just do the trick.

Next week, the Eat Beat goes
nuts.

“The Fantasticks,’’ one of the
longest-running musicals in

Washington and Lee University

the Boiler Room Theatre.

Directed by senior George

Weatherly, the musical will run
for six nights. Curtain time is 8

In polite deference to W&L

produced the film, and who is
currently raking in millions for
his handiwork (let’s hear it for
capitalism), I won’t go into the
details about how unmemorable
the film was, but I do challenge
anyone to repeat one sentence of
dialogue from the movie five

is one character who is some-
what amazing, despite the han-
dicap of speaking solely by
means of sound effects (I sup-
pose that’s why he was amaz-
ing). The remaining members of
the cast might have fared better
if they had spoken in sound ef-
fects as well (some things are
still sacred in Hollywood).

In light of the scintillating
review so far of Police
Academy, the only advice I can
give with a clear conscience to
the W&L moviegoer is to be loyal
to your fellow brethren and go
see the movie. Or if by chance
you can’t find time in your busy
spring schedule, give the three
dollars to your favorite W&L
charity. Same difference.

goes on to say that “‘in movies,

ideas...a poetic original.”’

Jonah is a witty and lyrical
farce of people and politics, a
film that should be just the thing
for an evening in spring.

Paul Maslansky takes
classmates to the movies

Members of Washington and
Lee’s Class of 1954 were the
beneficiaries of a rare treat
when they returned to Lexington
this weekend to celebrate their
30th reunion.

One of their classmates took
them all to the movies. More
precisely, he took them all to his
movie.

Hollywood producer Paul
Maslansky is a member of that
W&L Class of 54. When he
returned to Lexington on Friday,
he discovered that his latest
film, Police Academy, was
playing at one of Lexington’s two
movie houses.

So Friday night Maslansky
and 40 members of his reunion
class and their spouses, along
with a few other invitees from
the school, presented
themselves at the State Theatre
box office, where Maslansky
proceeded to introduce himself
to the ticket seller and asked to
rent the theatre for a special 11
p.m. screening of his film.

After satisfying the skeptical
ticket seller by producing an ID
to show that he was, indeed,
Paul Maslansky, executive pro-
ducer of ‘Police Academy, he
and his classmates had the
theatre to themselves for the
special screening.

‘Athletes aren’t politicians....’

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

...As the Russian boycott deal
begins to get very old and tired
— and it’s only been a week and
a half — here are some thoughts
on the state of the athlete in the
world and where he’s going...or
should we say, where he’s allow-
ed to be going. You can talk until
you’re red in the face — pun in-
tended — but last week’s news-
that-makes-you-feel-like-vom-
iting isn’t going to be turned into
a misprint. The pullout has been
called a_returning-the-1980-
Olympic-favor sort of action. No
doubt. Recent reports from
Poland say Moscow officials
mentioned the action as early as
November. So what is to be done
now? I think we need to go back
to Square One (friendly gather-
ing for athletic competition) for
the simple reason that we’re not
there at the present time. But
something tells me we can’t. It’s
not that we’ve forgotten what the
basis is for the Olumpic move-
ment. Rather, it’s that we’re
really not that ooncerned about
it. That is, at least when it comes
to something as unconnected to
athletics as world politics. (By
the way, we’re just as guilty,
given Southside Jimmy’s
blunderific move in 1980) I think
the Olympics has reached a
point of no return. What once
was a simple meeting of athletes
has now become a forever-en-
tangled meeting of nations and

their athletes. There’s a not-so-
subtle difference there that’s
manifesting itself at present.
Trouble is, when the big boys
play with athletes, they forget
the athletes and in the end

ime Out

they’re the ones getting hurt.
Athletes aren’t politicians.
They’re people who compete in
pursuit of perfection. It doesn’t
work to mix the two species.
Especially when the latter are

 

most enjoyable when left alone...

As we turn to the colonnade,
here’s a tip of the cap to the four
Generals who earned All-ODAC
baseball honors: Dave Warren-
feltz, who was selected to the
first team, and Mike Walsh, Bill
White and frosh Milam Turner.
Problem is, I wish I could extend
first-team kudos to White, but
those who decide such things
saw fit to leave the league’s best
ERA man off the first squad. But
then I guess those who continual-
ly meet the challenge, the clutch
performers, don’t make the list.
C’mon guys, credit where credit

is due...At least the ODAC boys
did not overlook the obvious
twice. They were quickwitted
enough to bestow — most de-
servingly — on John Lee Graves
the student-athlete of the year
award. And with John Lee’s
honor let’s not forget the effort
put forth by the Generals’ cage
mentor Verne Canfield, who is a
successful guide as much off the
court as he is on the court....

...J0hn McEnroe has yet to
lose a match in ’84 (that’s 32
straight) and, what’s more, he’s
behaving himself. Gee, John
nice guys don’t always finish

last...

....1f you’ve thought the Celts
were spent after seven games
with the Knicks, guess again.
Lakers will be tough but pro-
bably will also be untested. Final
series will be interesting to see
how fatigue vs. inactivity turns
out. This corner has Lakers,
despite Bird getting MVP
honors...

dans And speaking of NBA
scene, here are some final words
for ESPN commentator Dick
Vitale: Lose your voice and take
up sewing...

Frisbee:New club on sold ground after a year

The Washington and Lee
Ultimate Frisbee Club has con-
cluded its 1983-84 season and is
looking forward to next year and
to continuing the high level of
competition and enjoyment that
were present on this year’s
squad, according to outgoing
captain David Thompson.

The team, known as the Nades
— derived from their fair
weather practice site, the colon-
nade —competed against squads
from U.Va., Virginia Tech, Rich-
mond, Charlottesville, James
Jadison, William and Mary, and
Washington, currently the fifth-
ranked team in the country.

As many as 30 players par-
ticipated or practiced with the
team. Thompson pointed to five,
in particular, who led the travel-

 

Duckhead Shorts

Madras Shirts

Alvin-Dennis

ing team.

These included Mark
Machonis, whom Thompson
cited for ‘great hustle on

defense.’’ Thompson also prais-
ed the defensive skills of Steve
Carey. ‘‘He’s our big man, alsoa
great threat on the _ break-
aways.”

An offensive standout this
year for the Nades was Matt
Vawter, who ran the offense and
had an excellent throwing arm,
Thompson said. Vawter will be
taking over the reins as next
year’s captain.

Thompson also mentioned the
strong sidearm of Mel Cote as an
offensive key.

Ultimate is played with seven
players on a team. The field is 80
yards long with two 20-yard end

“The best part of the game is
its lack of officials.’’ said
Thompson. ‘‘Honesty in calling

senior field player Tim Rock,
and sophomore Tim Stanford.

This is the first year that W&L
has had more than one athlete
named to the AWPCA All-Amer-
ica team.

“All three are outstanding
water polo players, who have put
in the extra effort and have earn-
ed this award,” said W&L
aquatics director Page Remil-
lard.

“Rock would have made any
All-America team, on any level.
He was an intimidator on both
ends of the pool. Of defense, he
stopped the opponents key offen-
sive threat, ad and he was very
instrumental in our offensive
success,’”’ Remillard said.

‘‘Kadesky, while not as big as
most of the top goalies (he is
5’8”), was a standout all year.
He made the big saves, those
which stopped our opponents
before they could get their
momentum going,”’ he said.

“Stanford is a fast swimmer,
whose conditioning and personal
competitiveness made him an
extremely valuable asset as the
game progressed. In the late
stages of the game, he always
seemed to make the big plays,”’
Remillard said.

Rock earned second team All-
America honors in water polo in
1980, and is a two-time swim-
ming All-America, including this
year (as a result of his eighth-
place finish in the 1,650-yard
frestyle at the NCAA Champion-
ships).

Kadesky had been named to
the All-East Coaches team in
1982.

Stanford was a member of
W&L’s 400-yard freestyle and
800-yard freestyle relay teams
that earned All-America status.

Four All-ODAC, only one first team

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
baseball team placed four
players on the 1984 Old Dominion
Athletic Conference all-
conference team announced
Monday.

Senior shortstop and _ co-
captain Dave Warrenfeltz was
the only General to make the all-
ODAC first team.

Three Generals—senior first
baseman and co-captain Mike
Walsh, junior pitcher Billy White
and freshman third baseman
Milam Turner—were named to
the second team.

Based on these facts, one
would guess that W&L head
coach Jim Murdock would be
pleased with the selection of the
all-conference teams. Not so.
Murdock was surpriséd and
unhappy over the exclusion of
White from the first team.

The teams are selected by the
conference coaches, and Mur-
dock believes that ‘“‘politics’’ in-
volved with the selection kept
White off the first team.

“You'd think that grown men
could put away petty jealousies
and personal differences,’”’ Mur-
dock said. ‘‘We’re disappointed
for Billy, but we realize that we
hada good season.”

“I’m definitely not taking
away from our other players
who were selected,” he added.
“I think they all deserved what
they got.”

Warrenfeltz finished the
season with a_ .360 batting
average, second highest for the
Generals. He tied for the team
lead in RBI’’s with 17.

White finished the season with
a record of 6-2 and a scant ERA
of 1.09, best in the ocnference.
He batted .263 and saw a good
deal of playing time at third
base.

Walsh led the team in slugging
percentage at .524 and tied with
Warrenfeltz for the RBI lead
with 17. Walsh, who batted .302,
was second on the team in
fielding percentage at .970, trail-
ing only catcher Mike Jacoby,
who finished the season with a
.980 fielding percentage.

Turner led the team in hitting
with a .361 batting average and
was second in slugging percen-
tage.

Centerfielder Hugh Finkel-
stein was successful on nine of
his 13 stolen base attempts, tops
on the team.

 

Jacoby and White have been
named co-captains for the 1985
season.

“Considering the way we
finished the season — on a

positive note and with a good at-
titude —, I think it will help
tremendously next year,’’ Mur-
dock said. ‘‘We’ll be hard press-
ed to replace our seniors defen-
sively, but we have some good

Ueberroth ’S MisSION:
Stemming Soviet tide

By KEN RAPPOPORT
AP Sports Writer

The president of the Los
Angeles Olympic Committee, in
the face of Soviet insistence that
their pullout from the Summer
Games is ‘‘irrevocable,”’ says he
hopes to stem the ‘‘domino”’ ef-
fect of other nations joining the
boycott.

“We owe it to other athletes
from other countries who want
to be here to try and reverse ‘the
Soviets’ efforts to get others to
join them,” Peter Ueberroth
said Monday. ‘‘We’ll use re-
sources and we’ll use energy
because we owe it to the U.S.
athletes.”’

Ueberroth, also saying he has
not completely given up on the
Soviets coming to Los Angeles,
will try to get them to reverse
their decision at Lausanne,
Switzerland, on Friday, where
the International Olympic Com-
mittee has called an emergency
meeting. The Soviets have an-
nounced that they also will at-
tend the meeting, but their of-
ficials insist they won’t change
their decision to stay out of the
Los Angeles Games.

Ueberroth said Olympics of-
ficials had discussed the pos-
sibility of extending the June 2
deadline for declaration of par-
ticipation in the Games, but that
decision remained up to the IOC.

Asked what he will tell the
Soviets, Ueberroth replied:

“We will say some nice things
and we will say some coopera-
tive things, but we will also say
that we were insulted by some of
the things (they said), such as
that we would try to drug their
athletes.”

Ueberroth also expressed con-
cern about the list of boycotting
nations growing. Eight other

countries — East Germany,
Bulgaria, Vietman, Laos,
Mongolia, Czechoslovakia,

Afghanistan and Hungary,

 

which declared its intention not
to attend the Games yesterday
— followed the Soviets’ lead in
withdrawing from the Games.

“They are trying to influence
the better part of the globe,”’
Ueberroth said of the Soviets —
a charge that was denied Mon-
day at a news conference by
Marat Gramov, chairman of the
Soviet Union’s National Olympic
Committee.

Gramov also said, ‘‘We, in
principle, are against all alter-
native, parallel games, or any
other kind of games seen as a
counter-balance to the Los
Angeles Olympics.” But a Polish
journalist, who requested
anonymity, says sports officials
from the Soviet Union and its
allies met last week to discuss
organizing a  ‘‘counter-
olympics” and decided instead
to divide events among Com-
munist nations.

A sports official, who also
spoke on the condition that he
not be identified, said the com-
petitions would not be held at the
same time as the July 28-August
12 Los Angeles Games to avoid
conflict with the Olympic
charter, which specifically for-

bids counter-games.
The U.S. State Department on
Monday took issue with

Gramov’s statement that all
Soviet complaints about Olym-
pic preparations were ‘‘flatly
refected”’ at an April 27 meeting
in Washington.

State Department Counselor
Edward Derwinski said he was
puzzled by Gramov’s account of
what happened. The State
Department also took the
unusual step of releasing the text
of a document turned over to
Minister-Counselor Victor
Isakov of the Soviet Embassy by
Derwinski.

Derwinski said in a telephone
interview he emphasized U'S.
willingness ‘‘to cooperate and
communicate”’ with Soviet of-
ficials on Olympics matters.

passed by an 8-3 margin after a
lengthy debate. Green, junior
representative Bob Tomaso and
sophomore representative Ken
Lindeman opposed the motion.

Jenevein said that innocent
students still will use the right of
appeal and will win every time.
But not only do you want to get
guilty students out of the univer-
sity, but also you want to prevent
them from ever claiming affilia-
tion to Washington and Lee, Jen-
evein said.

Junior representative Cole
Dawson said that all the students
he has talked to have been in
favor of putting ‘‘expelled’’ on
the transcript, and EC Secretary
Jim Messer said alumni he had
talked to also supported the
measure.

Former EC President Bennett
Ross said that the goal of the

Huntley promoted at Best,
Lewis to step down June 7

Former Washington and Lee
President Robert E.R. Huntley
was named president and chief
operating officer of Best Pro-
ducts Co. Inc. of Richmond this
week.

Huntley, who was W&L’s
president from 1968 to 1983, has
been a Best executive vice presi-
dent and president of the com-
pany’s catalog showroom divi-
sion since January.

The move is the result of an
announcement by Best chair-
man and chief executive officer
Sydney Lewis, a W&L graduate
and trustee emeritus, that he
will relinquish his post on June 7.

He will be succeeded by his
son, Andrew M. Lewis, who cur-

honor system was to get dis-
honorable people out of the
school, not to mark someone for
life, which he said the addition of
“expelled’’ to the transcript
would do.

“Don’t change the system
because you think you’re not get-
ting enough convictions,’ Ross
advised.

Vice President Dave Judge
said that at present the closed
hearing had become meaning-
less because everyone the EC
convicts is going to an open hear-
ing.

Three of four students who ap-
pealed closed hearing convic-
tions this year have been acquit-
ted in open hearings.

Ross said the increased
number of acquittals in open
hearings this year was a fluke.
In the last five years, 50 percent
of the persons who appealed
their cases lost the open hearing,
Ross pointed out.

‘“T don’t think it’s a fluke at
all,” Jenevein said. “It’s a

rently holds the position Huntley
will assume.

Sydney Lewis, 64, will con-

tinue as chairman of the ex-,

ecutive committee of the com-
pany’s board. He founded Best
Products 27 years ago with his
wife, Frances, a member of the
W&L Board of Trustees. Mrs.
Lewis is an executive vice presi-
dent of Best.

For years, the Lewises have
been generous benefactors of
W&L. The law school building is
named for Mrs. Lewis.

Huntley could not be reached
for comment. ‘‘He’s been so tied
up in meetings I haven’t seen
him for three days,”’ his sec-
retary said.

trend. Anyone would be a fool
not to go public next year,’’ he
said.

Freshman representative An-
drew Caruthers noted that once
a person is charged the good
standing clause on his transcript
is whited out, but no additional
notations are made on his
transcript even if he is convicted

in the open trial. There must be .

some discouragement from go-
ing to an open trial.

Sophomore representative
James White argued that if a
person knew he was guilty, the
threat of having ‘‘expelled’’ put
on his transcript if convicted in
the open hearing would dis-
courage him from appealing.

Lee Feldman, a member of the
White Book Revisions Commit-
tee, argued that the majority of
students who attend open honor
hearings believe many of the
defendants are guilty, but the
jury acquits them. Because of
this, many students see the
honor system as a ‘“‘joke,”’
Feldman said.

Feldman said that the average
student finds out about a case
before the open hearing, and
thus is disqualified from serving
in the jury. As a result, the
students selected for the jury
tend to be ‘“‘introverts’’ who are
‘not from the mainstream of the
university,’ Feldman argued.
These jurors are less likely to
convict someone than _ the
average student, Feldman said.

“If you make it a little more
trouble to go open, you give the
honor system a little more bite,”’
Feldman said.

In other action, the EC approv-
ed a measure that will give the
EC the option of getting a law
student to help them prosecute
open trials. Initially, the EC
passed the measure by a 5-4 vote
with two abstentions, but after a

measure the EC passed it by a

6-3 margin.

honored law enforcement of-
ficials’ stated desire that the
panel focus on dealers, not
users, of controlled substances.

He said that a copy of the in-
dictment recommendations had
been provided to Common-
wealth’s Attorney Beverly C.
“John” Read, who requested
that the panel be formed and
acted as the main counsel to the
special grand jury throughout its
investigation.

“It’s not appropriate for me to
comment at this time,’’ Read
said.

The judge has not determined
what if any portions of the report
will be released.

“‘T feel that people who need to
be protected should be protected
as strongly as I think the Com-
monwealth ought to prosecute
those who need to be pro-
secuted,”’ Honts said.

“For that reason, as far as the
report is concerned, I would be
disinclined to issue blanket in-
formation that might involve in-
nocent people.’’

Clerk of Circuit Court Bruce
Patterson said his office has
handled at least 200 subpoenas
for the special grand jury, about
10 percent of which were for
juveniles.

He said Read had also issued a
number of subpoenas, and that

 

the special grand jury had sum-
moned some _ witnesses _in-
dependently.

In addition, in November the
panel subpoenaed the long
distance telephone records for
the last two years of three
former W&L students.

In January, the special grand
jury subpoenaed certain student
records at W&L and VMI.

Patterson said the investiga-
tion resulted in ‘‘several feet”’ of
transcripts of the sessions.
Three large boxes containing the
panel’s working papers, exhibits
and transcripts and tape recor-
dings have been sealed and turn-
ed over to Honts.

According to Patterson, the
special grand jury held 27 ses-
sions at which witnesses ap-
peared, and an_ unspecified
number of additional meetings.
He said jurors were paid $20 per
session.

A county official said the total
compensation for the nine jurors
was approximately $6,300. By
law, all expenses of a special
grand jury are reimbursed by
the state.

Todd Jones, president of the
Rockbridge County-Buena Vista
Bar Association, said the com-
mittee that organization formed
in March to investigate ‘the
orderly administration of justice
in Rockbridge County,” had
not completed its work.

When the fire was reported at

east side of the house and had
burned through the roof.

“We know that it went from

Gerald Simpson, special agent

60 indictments recommended

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

About 60 indictments and heightened drug
prevention efforts by area schools were
recommended by the special grand jury in-
vestigating local drug trafficking, Circuit
Court Judge George E. Honts III said in a
statement this week.

‘In recommending the approximately six-
ty persons for indictment, we feel that we
have only begun to scratch the surface in
seeking out the users and dealers,”’ the nine-
member jury said in its report.

Honts has said he will not comment on the
number of students who might be involved
with the indictments, which he said were
mostly for felony offenses

During its seven-month investigation, the
special grand jury interviewed more than 200
witnesses, including students and ad-
ministrators from Washington and Lee and

Virginia Military Institute.

In addition, certain student records from
both schools were subpoenaed by the panel.
Some Student Control Committee records
were released to the jury in late January.

The judge on Monday issued the one page
of ‘‘conclusions’’ by the panel, and said that
except for any possible indictments stem-
ming from the jury’s recommendations, he
did not intend to unseal any additional por-
tions of the report.

Recommendations from the special grand
jury can be referred by the Commonwealth’s
Attorney to the regular grand jury, which
can issue indictments.

In his statement, Honts said that while the
grand jury may be recalled at any time,
“whether that Grand Jury will be recalled
has not been determined at this time.”’

When the special jury was impaneled last
October, the judge directed it ‘‘to investigate
recent illegal drug trafficking and certain

other criminal activities in this community.”
“There is, indeed, a large circle of drug
dealers and users within the area, affecting
all age groups, from high schools through the
"oe and involving all levels of socie-

The report said that W&L and VMI should
‘implement stringent screening of all incom-

effective guidelines for anti-drug programs,
working in concert with the local law en-
forcement authorities. ’’

The jury advised further that when
students or cadets are dismissed for drug
use, possession or dealing, they should be
turned over to local officials for prosecution
The report said that students should be ad-
vised of that policy at the beginning of each

Regular committee business
was conducted this morning, and
the regular Board meeting will
be held tomorrow, with adjourn
ment scheduled for the early
afternoon.

Wilson said the trustees are
expected to approve four new
department chairmen for next
year: Dr. Delos D. Hughes in
Politics, Dr. John K. Jennings in
Journalism and Communica-
tions, Dr. Minor L. Rogers in

A final decision on coeducation
is expected at a special meeting
of the Board scheduled for July
13 and 14.

Wilson said he expects that
this weekend will be a time of
reflection and discussion of the
subject by Board members.

“The only decision that could
be made at this meeting would
be a ‘no’ decision, and I don’t ex-
pect that to happen,” he said. “‘I
expect the Board will spend its
time learning from each other.”’

The president said he wants
“mainly to listen’ at this
meeting. ‘‘In July, I’ll obviously
have to make a recommenda-

Review and Outlook

Coeducation and
the Burden of Proof

It is safe to say that coeducation has been the most
burning issue affecting Washington and Lee in the
past five years. This is for good reason, as it is a ques-
tion of extreme depth and importance, cutting
straight to the heart of Washington and Lee’s past and
bearing directly on Washington and Lee’s future. It is
necessary that the question of whether Washington
and Lee is to remain — and should remain — single-
sex be asked.

Some have run into the face of coeducation blindly,
waving a flag of tradition. Others have answered the
question just as blindly, saying it is needed for pro-
gress. The question should not be dealt with on an
emotional level; it calls for sober reflection on the ef-
fects of coeducation as well as the effects of remain-
ing single-sex. The question appears to be one of
necessity. Is it necessary for Washington and Lee to
admit women to avert an admissions crisis in the
future? Is it necessary to admit women to improve
even further the academic atmosphere? President
Wilson has said that in the face of such a drastic and
far-reaching change, the burden of proof must lie with
the one advocating the change. We cannot agree
more.

Demographics has been one of the strongest argu-
ments put forth by the proponents of coeducation. A
close study of the numbers reveals that the drop is not
as staggering as it may seem. Assuming that the 30
percent drop among college-age youths in Wash-
ington and Lee’s principal 15-state market is ac-
curate, the actual loss of students would only amount
to three per state each year over the specified ten-
year period. Certainly this is not an insurmountable
barrier, and we hope coeducation is not a panic re-
sponse to simple statistics.

Another point of contention is the strong possibility
that coeducation would greatly diminish the tremen-
dous individuality that Washington and Lee enjoys.
Certainly the Honor System and the traditions of
Lee’s teachings would separate Washington and Lee
from the rest of the nation’s colleges, but it is likely
that the school would slip back into the pack and be
another small, liberal arts school. Individuality in
universities today is a precious commodity.

We have not been sufficiently convinced that
coeducation at Washington and Lee is necessary in
the near future. We would hope that more aggressive
recruiting might help solve the anticipated admis-
sions problem. Certainly finding three more students
from each of our top 15 states is not an impossible
recruiting task.

We are convinced, however, of the validity of the
adage, ‘‘When it is not necessary to change, it is
necessary not to change.’’ We are by no means saying

that Washington and Lee should never admit women
to its undergraduate program, rather that it is not
necessary at this particular time.

enough. Debates, letters,
forums, polls, polls and more
polls have almost numbed many
into apathy, but here is just
another note on the issue.

I like women just as much as
the next heterosexual W&L
gentleman, but I cannot say that
I am totally committed to a
policy of coeducation because I
fail to see what problems co-
education will eliminate. I am
told it will ‘‘raise the academic
standards,’ but aren’t there
other ways of accomplishing the
same goal while remaining a
single-sex institution? I am told
that ‘“‘coeducation is the in-
evitable destiny of single-sex
schools’’ because everyone else
is doing it, but does that mean it
is right for us? There is a big dif-
ference between being different
and being wrong. Further, I am

told that it would ‘‘add variety to
the classroom experience,” but
then I ask, ‘“‘Why did we pick
W&L in the first place?” There
are other small, fine quality,
coed schools in this country,
aren’t there? The sexual homo-
geneity of W&L is no secret.
Gentlemen, we have a lot of
thinking to do, but first we must
realize that coeducation is no
wonder drug to cure all the ails
of this institution. In fact, it
might even bring greater prob-
lems than the ones we face at the

present. This is not a silly issue
like the infamous ‘‘tie episode.”
We owe it to ourselves and to the
future generations of W&L
students to consider carefully
this decision. Let not students 20
years hence look back regretful-
ly, and question, ‘‘Are we better
off now than we were in 1984?”
My mother used to warn, ‘‘look
before you leap.’’ This time it
might serve us well to take heed
my mother’s warning.

MS thanks IFC pie eaters

To the Editors:

On behalf of the Blue Ridge
Chapter of the National Multiple
Sclerosis Society I would like to
thank the folks who contributed
their time and energies in mak-
ing the sixth annual IFC pie-
eating contest, to benefit MS, the
biggest success ever — the IFC,
Dave Perdue, the stadium

grounds crew, Dee Miriello,
Burr Datz and the Delts. Over
$500 was raised at halftime of the
Loyola lacrosse game. Your sup-
port of this annual event, to raise
money to find a cure for this
dreaded crippler of young
adults, is appreciated.

Jenevein applauds Wilson

To the Editors:

Enough controversy for one
year! I’m not writing to take a
stand or to chastise someone
else’s stand on a controversial
issue. I had my fill a long time
ago. I’m writing to thank one
member of this community for
his service which, due to its
nature, required courage and
strength of character. I’m
speaking of President Wilson.
Ever since his arrival last year,
he has butted heads with the stu-

dent body and to a lesser extent,
with the alumni. Speaking from
personal experience, it’s no fun
to butt heads and to incur the
wrath of W&L_ students.
Nevertheless, John D. Wilson
has stood by his convictions and
by his vision of a_ better
Washington and Lee. I can
assure you from my extensive
dealings with him that those con-
victions and that vision are inex-
tricably intertwined. His only
goal for our great school is to

such a goal may seem trite or ob-

President much more lonely
than it had to be.

In closing, we are not obliga-

to approve of the President’s

applaud a man whose integrity
has bound him to his beliefs in
the face of protest and resent-

another President whose name

Faculty to recommend

degree for Dederick

The faculty voted 47-38 Mon-
day not to reconsider its original
decision to award a diploma to
William Dederick, who was ar-
rested just prior to his gradua-
tion last May and was later con-
victed on three drug-related
charges.

The Student Affairs Commit-
tee suspended Dederick for one
academic year in October and
the faculty recommended he
receive a degree May 7, when it
reviewed degree applications for
1984 commencement.

But journalism professor
Clark Mollenhoff asked Univer-

sity President John D. Wilson to
present the matter to the facul-
ty again because, Mollenhoff
said, the first faculty vote was
based on an incomplete record.

Public record at Clerk of Court
Bruce Patterson’s office show
that, while pleading guilty to
selling cocaine, possessing co-
caine and possessing marijuana
with the intent to distribute,
Dederick admitted to making a
40 percent profit on a sale of co-
caine and threatening the life of
a student who had bought co-
caine from him.

Fellin honored
with ODK award

Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s chapter of the national
leadership fraternity Omicron
Delta Kappa has given its
Rupert N. Latture Outstanding
Sophomore Award posthumous-
ly to Thomas J. Fellin, the stu-
dent who died in a fraternity
house fire in April.

Lexington Police Chief L.O.
Sutton and state investigators
announced May 15 that the April
11 early-morning fire at the Phi
Gamma Delta house probably
was the result of arson.

No suspects have yet been
identified or arrested in the
case, though.

Established in 1981, the award
is given to the Washington and
Lee sophomore who best exem-
plifies the ideals of Omicron
Delta Kappa, which was estab-
lished on the W&L campus in
1914 to recognize leadership in
campus activities — scholastic,
athletic, social, religious and
literary.

The Latture Award is named
for the sole surviving founder of
ODK. Latture, a 1915 graduate of
Washington and Lee, was pro-

fessor of political science at the
univesity from 1920 to 1962.

“Tom Fellin’s death was a loss
felt deeply by every member of
the Washington and Lee fami-
ly,” said W&L junior Christo-
pher Williams, president of the
Alpha Circle of ODK. ‘“‘He em-
bodied all those ideals that ODK
represents, and we felt it was on-
ly appropriate that we make this
award to him.”

A graduate of Bishop Hafey
High School in Hazleton, Pa.,
Fellin was an honor roll (a

grade-point average of at least
3.5 on a 4.33 scale) student and
had been one of Washington and
Lee’s two nominees for a Harry
S. Truman Scholarship.

He had been inducted into Phi
Eta Sigma, the national fraterni-
ty recognizing outstanding
scholarship by freshmen, and
was a member of the College Re-
publicans.

_He served as co-president of
the Phi Gamma Delta social
fraternity, had been co-chair-
man of the Pennsylvania delega-
tion to the W&L Mock Demo-
cratic Convention, and was a
member of the varsity baseball
team.

the faculty (at the first vote) was
incomplete,’ Mollenhoff said
Tuesday.

At Monday’s special meeting,
Mollenhoff told the faculty of the
additional information from the
public record.

“I spelled out what I con-
sidered to be the complete
record and felt that the faculty
should have the complete record
befor the vote,” Mollenhoff said.

After an hour and 15 minutes
of debate, the faculty voted not
to reconsider their original deci-
sion.

“I feel what the faculty did,
they did with their eyes open this
time,”’ Mollenhoff said. He add-
ed that he does not plan to take
further action.

The Board of Trustees has the
power to overturn the faculty’s
recommendation of any student
diploma, but University spokes-

man Jeffrey Hanna said he could
not recall that happening before.

Caruthers thanks Jenevein

To the Editors:

In this last issue I wanted to
write and thank Robert Jenevein
for this year. I’m writing not
necessarily to thank Bob for
specific issues, but I am writing
in order to thank him for his
commitment and strong dedica-
tion to Washington and Lee
University. This year I’ve
witnessed the ‘‘all’” he has been
willing to give and has given to
W&L.

One might put Bob down for
raising some _ controversial
issues this year, but I want to re-
mind everyone that Bob has had
enough guts to stand up for what
he believed in his heart would be
best for W&L in the long run,
even if his belief made him an
unpopular man on campus. I ad-
mire Bob for taking his some-
times unpopular stands. One
must remember that some
alumni and Board members
have supported his stands; the
President of the Student Body
can often be caught in two
worlds.

But enough of that, I am
writing only in order to express

my utmost respect for Bob’s
firm dedication and leadership.
His office on the average re-
quires about three to six hours of
his time every day. Bob has
fulfilled his obligation to the stu-
dent body and has given a little
more. I want to thank Robert
Jenevein for giving the most
valuable gift a person can give to

In light of some limited feed-

it necessary to clarify a few
things concerning our ad prais-

First, the reason it appeared
so long after his final departure
from the school (about 5 mon-
ths), is because we were hoping
to find an appropriate public
forum in which to present to him

This is faith, the substance of things

she is our mother still. Let us, her faithful

EC, SBA near agreement on funding control

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

After lengthy negotiations,
subcommittees of the Executive
Committee and the Student Bar
Association have been unable to
agree on the exact amount of law
school student activities funds to
be returned to the SBA. But the
two sides did agree that the SBA
will have almost complete con-
trol over those funds.

“We won't set a percentage
until we figure out a method that
everyone agrees on because
we’ve got our method, and
they’ve got their method,”’ vice
president-elect James White
said.

Monday night, White had
reported to the EC that
preliminary estimates of the
percentage of the law school’s
contribution to the EC that
would be controlled by the SBA
were 84 or 87 percent. Tuesday,
however, White said that those
figures were arrived at while
laying the groundwork for a final
decision and were not binding.

“‘We’ll have a meeting at the
beginning of next year, when
we'll agree on a new method.
Then a new percentage will be
set. We apologize for the delay,
but we want to make sure it’s
done right,”’ explained White.

White, president-elect Cole
Dawson, junior representative-
elect Pat Hayden and sopho-

EC’s negotiating team for the
talks. SBA President-elect John
Sicilian represented the SBA.

“We anticipate it will work out
very smoothly because we're go-
ing to work it out before school
starts. I don’t see any problems
with it. I think it’s going to work
out great,’’ White added.

Although no fixed precentage
was set, Hayden said it had been
helpful to at least start the talks
this spring.

White said that the percentage
of funds the SBA will control will
vary from year to year. The SBA
president and the EC president
will set the figure at the begin-
ning of each year, White explain-
ed.

White said that although the
negotiating group officially was
a subcommittee of this year’s
EC, it did not have to reach an
agreement on the fixed percen-
tage this year. The matter is
really up to next year’s EC,
White argued.

Although the SBA will not have
official fiscal autonomy regar-
ding the fixed percentage of
funds allocated to them, White

said the SBA will be ‘running

their own show.”’ The EC will
have no line-by-line veto power
over the SBA and will only retain
“emergency veto’’ rights, White
said.

“It’s fiscal autonomy in ef-
fect,’’ said Hayden.

Hayden said both the SBA and
EC agreed it would be imprac-
tical to get offical fiscal
autonomy for the SBA this

spring.

White reported that in order
for the SBA’s fiscal autonomy to
become official a constitutional
amendment would have to be
passed. An amendment pro-
viding for a second-year law
representative had failed earlier
this month, and the law school
students are not even here any-
more, noted White.

“This is going to be a major
step to reduce all the tension be-
tween the EC and the law school.
This was one of the major ten-
Sions,”’ White said.

Law school students had
resented the predominantly
undergraduate EC telling them
how to spend their money, White
remarked.

Calendar vote to be made in fall;
October break is part of proposal

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

The faculty will vote early
next fall on the calendar com-
mittee report, which includes a
recommendation that Thanks-
giving vacation be replaced by a
one-week vacation in the middle
of October.

The committee, composed of
eight faculty members and two
students, completed its work and
submitted its report to universi-
ty President John D. Wilson
April 30.

In addition to the vacation
change, the report also recom-
mends that classes be extended
to 55 minutes and calls for con-
tinuation of the 12-12-6 calendar
system.

“I have no quarrel with the
committee’s report (regarding
the 12-12-6),’’ Wilson said in an
interview this week.

Although Wilson emphasized
that he will try to remain neutra)

 

toll-free

i

as chairman of the faculty
meeting, “‘I don’t think there’s
any way I would feel good,”
about changing the vacation
schedule, he added.

“I’m not persuaded it would be
wise,”’ said Wilson, adding that
if there were no Thanksgiving
vacation, many students might
go home that week anyway.

Wilson said the report will be
reviewed by the faculty
Registration Committee and the
faculty Executive Committee
before being presented to the
faculty as a whole. He said he ex-
pects a decision to be made in
September or October. —

Senior Lee Feldman, a student
member of the calendar com-
mittee, said he expected both the
12-12-6 and the 55-minute classes
to pass the faculty, but added,
‘Your guess is as good as mine”’
as to whether the proposed
change in the vacation schedule
would be approved.

Feldman said the committee,
which had been meeting since
September, ‘‘was very receptive
to hearing from students. The
committee worked well as a

whole.
“It came down to a classic

Thanksgiving break was repre-
sentative of that. The students
were pretty much disregarded
when it came to the Thanksgiv-
ing break.”’

A student poll taken in March
showed support for the 12-12-6,
but strong opposition to 55-
minute classes and the change in
the vacation schedule.

“We didn’t feel the report ade-
quately reflected student sen-
timents,’’ Feldman said.

The committee’s report also
suggests that ways to relieve
faculty members of the burden
of registration be examined. It
suggests having students return-
ing the following year register
for the entire year’s classes in
the preceding spring as one
possible alternative.

Attached to the committee’s
report is a proposed calendar
that would consist of five six-
week sessions that individual
students or departments could
adjust according to their needs.
Wilson called modular scheme
‘‘a different idea...It would ac-
commodate the different disci-
plines much more readily.”’

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

The 1984 school year will
witness the promotion of two
faculty members to emeritus
status, five new department
heads, and three new faculty
members in the military science
department.

Professor of Romance Langu-
ages George F. Drake and Pro-
fessor of Engineering Henry L.
Ravenhorst will both retire at
the end of the current academic
year and become professors
emerti. Their experiences at
Washington and Lee exhibit
some parallels.

“When I first came to
Washington and Lee in 1940, I
had never taught before,’’ said
Drake, the University’s senior
faculty member. Drake’s doubts
concerning whether or not he
was cut out to be a teacher were
quickly dispelled following that
first class held in Robinson 2, the
room next door to his current of-
fice.

“T didn’t even have a master’s
degree at that time,’’ Drake
said. “I began just as an instruc-
tor.” Drake never received a
master’s, but earned his doc-
torate from the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

In his 44 years of teaching,
Drake has instructed both
French and chemistry. During
World War II, when student
enrollment dwindled ‘‘to 35 or 50
students”, he taught chemistry
in the Army’s AST program. For
18 months, he taught in the
Enlisted Reserve Corps at VMI.
“It was difficult to get jobs ...

up,’”’ said Drake in reference to
the military draft.

Professor Ravenhorst has
taught at Washington and Lee
since 1949. Like Drake, he taught
at VMI, as well as at some sum-
mer military schools.

“‘T had no inclination to go into
teaching until after the (Second
World) War,”’ said Ravenhorst,
who retired in the Reserves 10
years ago. A licensed architect,
he planned to go strictly into ar-
chitecture, yet he considers his
teaching job “‘a very useful and
well-rounded experience.”

Educationally, the two pro-
fessors have very opposite
backgrounds. Ravenhorst is a
1935 W&L graduate, while Drake
graduated from the country’s
first coeducational under-
graduate institution, Oberlin
College, in 1936.

Both, however, have similar
opinions on the issue of coeduca-
tion. Drake believes that if W&L
reaches a point where the life of
the University and its high
academic standards are en-
dangered because of remaining
single sex, then coeducation is
the solution. “I’m not thoroughly
convinced we have reached that
point,”’ he said.

“Basically, with my status as
an alumnus, I feel there is a need
for a single sex school,” says
Ravenhorst, who did graduate
work at Harvard, Dartmouth,
and the University of Alaska.
Due to his high regard for the
Board of Trustees, Ravenhorst
expects the Trustees to deter-
mine what is best for the Univer-
sity. ‘I would certainly feel that
the University could adjust ... ,”’
he said.

Neither of the two professors
has seen a tremendous change in
the students since the 1940’s,
although Ravenhorst has seen
his department’s emphasis
move from_ professional-type
degrees toward a more general
engineering degree.

“Since we changed, we have a
degree in what we call physics
engineering,’ said Ravenhorst,
who received his bachelor’s
degree in electrical engineering.
When he was a student, the
University gave more profes-
sional degrees in specific engi-
neering fields, while the contem-
porary curriculum is meant to
teach basic courses concerning
all aspects of engineering.

Due to the University’s liberal
arts atmosphere, Ravenhorst
sees no need to change the cur-

here is a very good program,”
he said.

While neither professor has
specific plans about working at
the University in the future, both
will remain in Lexington. ‘‘This
is, I feel, my home,” said Drake.
‘I’ve lived here longer than any-
where else.”’

Ravenhorst, who will maintain
his private architectural prac-
tice with his son, hopes to com-
plete work on a book relating the
history of W&L’s engineering
department. He and Drake are
both proud to be associated with
Washington and Lee.

“Tt have a great fondness for
Washington and Lee, and some
marvelous contacts with friends
and colleagues here,’’ Drake
said.

Elsewhere on the hill, five
department heads will be step-
ping down for the start of the
1984-85 academic year. Ap-
pointed to a five-year term by
the Board of Trustees, a depart-

may ask to step down, and must
step down upon reaching the age
of 65.

Hudson death probe ended

The investigation into the traf-

Ray Hudson Jr. in April has con-
cluded with no additional
charges being filed against the
driver of the car, Duncan Stone,
another W&L student.

John Buddin, a_ traffic
homicide investigator for the
Pensacola, Fla., police depart-
ment, said he completed his in-
vestigation last week and turned
over the report to the state’s at-
torney’s office.

The car Stone was driving

April 12 hit a stalled car on the
side of the road, trapping Hud-
son’s head. Hudson was partially
leaning out of the door at the
time of the accident, according
toreports at the time.

Stone was charged with
careless driving at the time.

Buddin said he interviewed
15-20 people who came into con-
tact with the students im-
mediately before and after the
accident. These included doctors
and nurses at the hospital and
employees at a fast-food res-
taurant.

Jury opposition leader steps down

By ALLEN REESE
and
TORI RICHARDSON
Staff Reporters

Angela Fawcett, a central
figure in the opposition to the
special grand jury, is abandon-
ing her leadership role in oppos-
ing the drug investigations.

“If there is another public
meeting, I feel it would be best
for someone else to head the
coordination,’’ Fawcett said. ‘‘I
can’t afford any more publicity.
However, I wouldn’t mind work-
ing behind the scenes.”

Fawcett said her leadership
role has thrust her into a position
she had not envisioned, and has,
at least temporarily, deprived
her of the custody of her daugh-
ter, Shandah.

Recently, Shandah’s father,
Jonathan Lyle Naff, has been in
contact with Rockbridge County
law officials trying to get
custody of his daughter, accord-
ing to Rockbridge County Sheriff
S.M. Reynolds.

However, due to the recent
controversy, Fawcett said she
voluntarily turned over her
daughter to Naff’s parents until
she disengaged herself from the
Rockbridge County drug investi-
gation.

“Jonathan never tried to get
custody of Shandah. He only
became concerned about her
general welfare after reading
Roanoke Times & World-News
reporter Mary Bishop’s article
on me in the paper.”

“He doesn’t object to me as a
parent. He does, however, object
to the situation that I have gotten
myself into.”

Fawcett claims that Ms.
Bishop’s article had a few facts
that were incorrect and made
her appear to be an unfit mother.

“TI was totally disgusted with
the article because some facts
were wrong and it did nothing
for me except to give me more
bad publicity. As it is now, Iam
forced to hitchhike everywhere
because local law officials are
still harassing me. I can’t even
drive my car around town with-
out being pulled over for some
trivial matter,’’ she claimed.

According to Fawcett, Naff’s
parents, who reside in Roanoke,
have supported her and have en-
dorsed her as the legal guardian
of Shandah.

““Naff’s parents are like my
own. They respect me and agree
that I am the better parent. They
would never back Jonathan if a
custody battle did happen to
arise. However, they are upset
that I didn’t gracefully bow out
of this situation and try to avoid
publicity,”’ she said.

Naff, a 23-year-old self-
employed painting contractor,
has been indicted and convicted
for robbery. He was given 10
years to be served in the
Virginia State Penitentiary. His
time was reduced to approx-
imately four years. He is now on
probation.

Fawcett earlier had admitted
to the use of LSD, marijuana and

Frat gives $500 donation

Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s chapter of Lambda Chi
Alpha fraternity presented
Stonewall Jackson Hospital with
a $500 donation this week.

The fraternity raised the
money for the gift through a raf-
fle, which was supported by
numerous Lexington merchants.

Lambda Chi Alpha president
Fred Bentley and vice president
Richard DeForest made the
presentation Monday to L.E.

Richardson, executive vice
president of the Stonewall
Jackson Hospital.

According to Richardson, the

fraternity’s gift will be used to
purchase surgical instruments
for use in the hospital’s new
surgical wing.

Bentley said the fraternity,
which has approximately 25
members, plans to make its
fund-raising program an annual
event.

‘Most of us only live in the
community four years, and we
felt it was only appropriate that
we give something back to the
community,’’ Benley said. ‘‘We
decided upon the _ hospital
because there is clearly a need
with the new wing being built.”’

of feeling about coeducation
—for example, why they express
such concern and reservations
about any fundamental change,
however well-intentioned, which
may upset that ambiance
they’ve come to know and love.”’

Prior to becoming the 2lst
president of W&L early last
year, Wilson served as executive
vice president and provost of
Virginia Polytechnic Institute in
Blacksburg.

“T think Washington and Lee is
more deeply rooted in Southern
culture than VPI is, even though

VPI draws almost entirely from
Virginia and Washington and
Lee is more cosmopolitan,”’ he
said. “‘It is a more deeply rooted
Southern institution.

“I think Robert E. Lee
translated with his own per-
sonality some of those
antebellum values’ which
became a part of the fabric of
this place and remain so today to
our great benefit.”

Wilson said the Executive
Committee, which he heads,
would Thursday examine the
“‘intangibles’’ of Washington and

cocaine. But she said she gave
up using cocaine because she
didn’t care for it.

She became known to the Lex-
ington community for her or-
ganization of a public meeting to
discuss the way officials had
been dealing with her and others
before the grand jury.

Fawcett said since she started
protesting the way the grand
jury had been conducting bus-
iness, her apartment has been
searched and several of her
friends have been questioned. In
addition, she said Jeff Peck of
Protective Services has been out
to her apartment to see if her
daughter was well cared for and

her car has been pulled over a
number of times and impound-
ed. She has also been brought up
before a judge on contempt
charges as a result of her grand
jury testimony. Fawcett said she
feels there was no reason for any
of this to have taken place.

Up until a few weeks ago,
Fawcett was trying to organize a
meeting between law enforce-
ment officials and members of
the public to talk about the grand
jury. However, the grand jury
recently issued its final report to
Judge Honts, ending the in-
vestigative part of their work.

Fawcett has been living away
from her Willow Spring apart-

ment since April 25 due to the
harassment she says she has
been subjected to.

“Since leaving my apartment,
several of my friends have been
busted. I think this is really
ludicrous.’’

Fawcett is now waiting for
Judge Honts to study the recom-
mendations of the special grand
jury and to decide on a course of
action.

“I already have a job waiting
for me when everything boils
over here with the grand jury
“Hopefully; things will be better
for Shandah and me when we
move and I am able to work
again.”

Frats told to clean up acts

Litter problem called ‘unsightly’ and ‘unsanitary’

By PEYTON CRAIGHILL
Special to the Phi

Washington and Lee and Lex-
ington have been plagued for
over 10 years with littered
fraternity house front lawns and
fly-infested dumpsters yet little
has been done to correct this un-
sightly problem.

In a letter dated March 14 of
this year, Health Department
Sanitarian Woody Bowyer wrote
Assistant Dean Dan Murphy, in-
forming him of the department’s
findings in its bi-annual inspec-
tion of the fraternity houses.

“The major problem we en-
counter at the frat houses is im-
proper garbage disposal,’’ he
wrote. ‘‘This department and the
city continually receive com-
plaints about the unsightly mess
and unsanitary conditions
around the garbage storage
areas.”

The trash problem isn’t new
—correspondence concerning it
litters the department’s files.

More than 10 years ago, in
February 1973, a similar letter
was sent to Dean of Students
Lewis John by then Sanitarian
Jack Talbot.

‘The garbage storage areas of
the various fraternities seem to
be the main trouble spot,’’ he
wrote. ‘If these areas were kept
in better condition the whole
campus would benefit.’”’

The university has assured the
Health Department the problem

English dept.

will be corrected.

In 1974 Dean John wrote
Talbot, ‘‘We shall certainly work
with the fraternities to correct
the deficiencies noted in your
reports.”’

A year later John echoed this
commitment. ‘‘You may be
sure,” he wrote, ‘‘that I shall
work with the presidents of the
fraternities involved in giving
particular attention to the trash
situation around the dumpsters
and garbage cans...”

Health Department records in-
dicate the major offenders are
Beta Theta Pi, Phi Delta Theta,
Phi Kappa Sigma, Pi Kappa

Alpha, Sigma Chi and Sigma Nu. -

Last week, Dean Murphy sent
the presidents of these frater-
nities a letter urging them to buy
dumpsters and ‘‘take pride in
the appearance of your fraterni-
ty and become more aware of
the impact the appearance of
your house and lawn has on both
the fraternity system and Wash-
ington and Lee.”’

City and state regulations
don’t require dumpsters for gar-
bage storage areas, provided the
garbage is stored in proper con-
tainers not accessible to flies
and animals. However, several
fraternities continue to use open-
air enclosures that allow
animals in and garbage out.

Furthermore, dumpsters
alone aren’t the answer. The
latest Health Department in-
spection records indicate that
although Phi Delta Theta and

Wornom and Mahanawards

Five Washington and Lee
students were honored by the
W&L department of English dur-
ing an awards ceremony last
Thursday.

Grant David Hamrick won the
Jean Amory Wornom Award for
Distinguished Critical Writing
for a paper titled, ‘The
Language of the Fallen in John

Milton’s ‘Paradise Lost.’ ’’

Four students won George A.
Mahan Awards in Creative
Writing. David W. Ames won the
senior prose award for his story
titled ‘“‘Two Loves.’’ Robert D.
Bryant won the junior prose
award for “Darling, you gotta
let me know.”’ Brent M. O’Boyle
and J. Keith Pillow both won
freshman prose awards.

Sigma Nu share a dumpster on
Henry Street, there is ‘‘almost
as much trash on the ground as
in the dumpster.”

The problem is frustrating for
Health Department officials and
the Lexington Police Depart-
ment.

Both departments have the
power to issue summonses to of-
fending parties (which would re-
quire them to respond to the
charges in court) but a warning
must first be given.

‘‘We have to give an opportuni-
ty for one to clean up the mess
before we can issue a sum-
mons,”’ Police Chief L.O. Sutton
said. He said the time period for
voluntary compliance is gen-
erally 72 hours.

The only way the department
can give an immediate sum-
mons is if an officer actually
observes someone dropping the
trash. “‘If we didn’t see someone
breaking bottles or throwing
garbage’’’ Sutton said, ‘‘we’re
hard-put to write a summons for
littering.”

Both departments, wishing to
avoid conflict with the school,
say they hope the university will
take the necessary steps to
resolve the problem.

“I would hope we can come up
with some effective enforcement
mechanism by this fall,’ John
said.

He referred to the report by
the recent ad-hoc committee on
fraternities that suggests the
problem be dealt with by the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee.

John said the SAC may con-
sider setting standards the
fraternities must adhere to. If
they fail to do so, he said social
probation may be used enforce
their compliance.

For the present the university
has adopted a ‘‘wait and see”’ at-
titude regarding the problem of
fraternity trash.

“We're now essentially in a
position of waiting to see if they
(the fraternities) choose to take
action,” Murphy said.

“The university hates to be in
a position to tell people what to
do,”’ he continued.

W&L law awards 105 juris doctor degrees

Former Dean Steinheimer speaks on professional conduct

Washington and Lee Universi-
ty awarded juris doctor degrees
to 105 law students during com-
mencement exercises for the
W&L School of Law Sunday.

Former Washington and Lee
law school dean Roy L. Stein-
heimer Jr. was the principal
speaker for the ceremony, which

was held on the lawn of the front
campus.

Steinheimer, who retired from
the W&L deanship a year ago,
spoke of the negative image that
lawyers often have in society
and warned the law graduates
that they are leaving the idyllic
world of the law school for a
world in which they will often be

 

Greystoke 1s

by CHARLIE ALCORN
Phi Columnist

Having been weaned on Tar-
zan movies, ogling stars like
Johnny Weismuller and Buster
Crabbe as they let out macho
screams of the wild, I felt Ihada
fairly thorough knowledge about
the Legend of the Jungle. Boy
was I wrong.

Greystoke, Lord of the Apes,
was based entirely on the liter-
ary classic,. Tarzan, by Edgar
Rice Burroughs. I had no idea
that Tarzan’s true identity was
that of a wealthy English lord. I

Flicks
Picks

thought all Tarzan’s were Olym-
pic swimming champions or at
least mindless body builders like
Miles O’Keefe (and his nude
sidekick, Bo Derek).

Greystoke, produced and
directed by Hugh Hudson, of
Chariots of Fire fame, has evolv-
ed from its serial roots to this
rendition that finally does jus-
tice to the classic novel. Filmed
in the spectacular settings of
The Republic of Cameroon and
Scotland, this film has the same
opulent feel to it that Chariots of
‘ire was recognized for. (Would
ne expect anything less from

e British? )

 

 

true Tarzan

The current Tarzan is master-
fully portrayed by newcomer
Christopher Lambert, whose
multi-faceted miming ability
results in an utterly believable
Lord of the Apes. His supporting
cast, which includes both the
rea) thing and actors dressed as
primates, were equally splendid
in every detail, recreating Tar-
zan’s jungle foster home.

Chariots alum Ian Holm gives
an outstanding performance as
the Belgian anthropologist who
befriends Greystoke and even-
tually returns him to his native
England. Andie McDowell is the
most beautiful and sophisticated
Jane ever to fall for the famed
ape-man. Miss McDowell’s and
Lambert’s bedroom scene has to
rank among the most original
seduction scenes in screen
history, with Tarzan bedding
proper Jane with that most
primal of pick-up lines, uggh,
uggh, urggh! (Go ahead and try
it. The worst she can do is ask for
a translation.)

So, my. advice to the W&L
moviegoer is to, by all means, go
see Greystoke, Lord of the Apes.
At the very least, you'll come out
knowing exactly who the guy is
who’s been swinging on the vines
for 40 years. More than likely,
you'll also come out with a
greater appreciation of your
ancestors. (Apologies go out to
all of you who are not practicing
Darwinist’s.) Happy viewing

 

 

this week and all summer long!

 

‘‘misunderstood and even un-
loved, even when they have
diligently and conscientiously
discharged their professional
obligations.”

Adding that the negative im-
age of lawyers ‘‘just naturally
goes with the territory of being a
lawyer,”’ Steinheimer said that
even though they may be mis-
understood and even unloved
‘“‘you can always command the
respect of others if you act as a
true professional should.”’

Steinheimer, who spent the
past semester teaching law at
the University of Alabama, cited
three specific areas of conduct
necessary for a lawyer to gain
such respect: dignity, decency

and honesty.
“By your manner, ap-
pearances, behavior and

language, you convey an impres-
sion of self-assurance and self-
respect which inspires con-
fidence but falls short of
aloofness,’ Steinheimer said.
‘Remember that the zealous
representation of a client’s
cause does not condone conduct
which is cruel, vindictive,
humiliating or demeaning.”

Honesty is the lawyer’s most
important trait, said Stein-
heimer, who urged the
graduates: ‘‘Resolve to be
honest at all events. Please
remember that the most impor-
tant asset you will have as a
lawyer throughout your profes-
sional career is your reputation
for honesty. No cause, no client
can be worth sacrificing your
reputation for honesty, which is
essential for your own feelings of
self-worth.”

Noting that he had not ex-
horted the graduates to remake
the world or even to try to
remake the legal profession,
Steinheimer said: “I ask only
that you take pride in your status
as a lawyer, though you will be
often misunderstood and un-
loved, and that you bring credit
to yourselves and to your profes-

The Year in W&L Sports

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

... Y'know, you can sit back
and take a review of the year in
W&L sports and be very nitpick-
ingly critical of an otherwise
quite successful year, but I don’t
want to do that. As with any
review and any reviewer, there
are countless ‘‘What if?”’ ’s sur-
rounding this year. In football:
What if the E&H game had come
later in the season? What if the
Hampden-Sydney game hadn’t
been on an off day? Soccer:
What if the final two minutes
against Radford had gone the
other way? Cross country: What
if the last 100 yards in Newport
News had been different?
Basketball: What if Fitz doesn’t
get hurt? What if Reggie
Thomas’ bomb doesn’t go in?
What if they don’t lose to Lynch-
burg in the first round of the
ODACs? Wrestling: What if
Easterns work out better?
Baseball: What if White is rested
for the ODAC championship
game? Track and field: What if
it doesn’t rain in Charlottesville?
Lacrosse: What if you take away
those three-, four-, five-goal
spurts that so many times doom-
ed the Generals’ efforts? Point
is, sure, there were holes, but,
much more than the holes there
were things that W&L athletes
should be proud of.

The football team wasn’t con-
tent to just play the game on
Saturday afternoons. They saw
fit to breaking records every

 

other week. Credit here goes not
only to those who get their
names in the book but also to
those behind the scenes and on
the sidelines. The soccer team

Time Out

was the best 8-5 squad in the na-
tion. Witness their five shutouts.
Tip of the hat to goalie Jay
Werner and departing senior
Roland Simon. Water polo had

another typical Page Remillard
year (25-12), as well as copping
their third straight Southern
League title. And cross country
had a fine season, finishing sec-
ond in the ODAC and watching
teammate Angus (A-A) Mc-
Bryde run three consecutive
brilliant races: He won ODAC
(set a course record), won
Regionals and took tenth (All-
American status) at Nationals.
The same holds true for the
winter’s teams. The General
grapplers had their best year
since ’73 and saw Jeff Dixon go

undefeated throughout the cam-
paign — the first time that’s ever
been done. The swimmers —
hard workers, indeed — only
sent six to nationals and brought

back a 15th place finish and, of

course, six All-Americans ~‘to
put W&L back on the swimming
map.” And basketball gave its
head man Verne Canfield his
17th winning season in 20 years
at W&L, while we watched two
class-act seniors, Messrs.
Baldwin and Graves, show us
how the game is played.

Ruggers finish at 4-2-1;
three could get All-State

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

The Washington and Lee
rugby club has concluded its
best season in some years and
has three players in the running
for selection to the Virginia
Select Side, an All-State team
that will compete in a national
tournament in New York in
August, according to club co-
captain Bill Jones.

The ruggers finished the
season with a 4-2-1 record, clos-
ing out the season by winning
two of its last three contests. The
Generals beat Virginia Tech and

the Chesapeake Bay Rugby
Football Club and lost to rival
VMI.

VMI defeated W&L, 16-12, but
the ruggers bounced back for a
win over the Hokie squad, 7-4.
Pacing the Generals over the
Tech club were George Borga,
who scored a try, and co-captain
Herb Funsten, who added a kick.

The ruggers finished the year
by defeating the Chesapeake
Bay team, a Baltimore-based
squad, 14-12. Leading the way
for W&L were Funsten, Jones,
Pete Pappasovos and Don
Wilkinson.

Side: Funsten, Jones and
sophomore Nick Berants. The
Select Side will represent
Virginia in a national tourna-
ment in Lake Saranac, N.Y., in
mid-August. The team is to be
named later this month.

With its best season in years,
the rugby club is looking to ex-
pand and gain more recognition,
said Jones.

“We're only losing three guys
off the team, and we’re going to
have a coach next year,”’ Jones
said, “‘so I think we’ll do really
well in the state overall.

“We’ve improved tremen-
dously since last spring,” he said
noting that a tournament sched-
uled for October featuring the
top teams in the state will be the
ruggers first proving ground.

Jones now thinks that some
recognition is to be expected. ‘‘I
think with guys being considered
for the state team and a chance
to be one of the top teams in the
State, I think we will get more
recognition from not only the
athletic department, but also
from the student body as a
whole.”’

Daly, assistants

to run summer

lacrosse camp

Washington and Lee lacrosse
coach Dennis Daly and his assis-
tant Sam Carpenter and Jeff
Long will head a staff of coaches
and present and former players
that will run a summer lacrosse
camp at W&L from July 8-13.

The camp will feature practice
sessions, face-off and goalie in-
struction, intra-ccamp competi-
tion and evening talks.

Enrollment is limited to 200
players, but Coach Daly said he
does not expect the camp to
reach capacity.

best ODAC finish (2nd) ever.

With the end of the school year
at hand, here is a quick look at
how fall sports at Washington
and Lee are shaping up for 1984.

Football

Head football coach Gary
Fallon enters his seventh season
at W&L with graduation leaving
several vacancies, namely, of-

fensive linemen and
linebackers.
Fallon, who has led the

Generals to four consecutive
winning seasons, including a 6-3
mark in 1983, said he has been
pleased with his team’s attitude
in the off-season and expects
several underclassmen to step in
and fill the openings along the of-
fensive line and at linebacker.

Fallon also said the incoming
freshman recruits for 1984 ‘‘look
good on paper, but I’ll reserve
my opinions until I see them on
the field.’’

Fallon cited several areas in
which the Generals should be
strong next season. W&L returns
its entire starting backfield and
receivers for the 1984 season.
Fallon also stated that the defen-
sive secondary and line will
feature, for the most part, ex-
perienced players who proved
themselves during the 1983
season.

W&L opens its season against
Dickinson College, a newcomer
to the Generals’ schedule, on
Sept. 8 at home. W&L will play 10
games in 1984 (six at home), as
opposed to nine in 1983.

Seniors Gene Girard, Pat
O’Connell and Tom Wiser will
serve as captains for the 1984
team.

Soccer

Head soccer coach Rolf Piran-
ian enters his ninth season at
W&L with a solid nucleus re-
maining from the 1983 squad to
build on in 1984.

W&L lost only two seniors
from last year’s 8-5 team,
leading Piranian to assess his
team’s prospects for 1984 op-
timistically.

“We're returning so many
solid upperclassmen that we
have to be pretty high going into

next season,’’ Piranian said.

Piranian also said that several
players who played on the junior
varsity last year have greatly
improved and should contribute
in 1984.

Co-captains for the 1984 season
are senior Rob Coleman and
junior Billy Holmes.

The Generals travel to Atlan-
ta, Ga., to participate in the
Emory University Tournament
on Sept. 15 and 16.

Water Polo

Water polo coach Page
Remillard sees 1984 as a ‘‘re-

building year’ for the Generals,
but he believes that a strong
recruiting year combined with
the returning upperclassmen
will keep W&L at the level it has
become accustomed to.
Remillard, who owns a 119-47
record in his five years at W&L,
including three consecutive
Southern Conference champion-
ships, said that the loss of our
Starters (two All-Americans)
from the 1983 team will be
“tough to replace. Early in the
season, I expect that we will take
our lumps. By the end of the
season, I expect us to maintain
the W&L tradition of pulling off

Senior Bobby Pearson and

for the 1984 team.

“I believe that 1984 will be a

able to win the conference in the
past during building years,’
Remillard said.

Miller, in his 33rd season at

W&L, said W&L has the ‘‘poten-

Miller said the incoming group
of freshman runners appears to
be a talented one, but that he
would be able to ‘‘evaluate them
better at the end of next season.”

Tennis year ‘better than anticipated’

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The 1984 Washington and Lee
tennis team finished their season
with a 13-8 overall record (3-0 in
ODAC Competition), a second-
place finish at the conference
championships, and with two
players who qualified for the
NCAA Division III National
Championships.

“The season was better than I
had anticipated and above our
expectations,” said head tennis
coach Gary Franke. Franke

stated that the team’s constant

improvement through the
season contributed greatly to its
success.

Despite the spring term
absence of their no. 3 singles
player Andy Haring, who was
studying in England, the Gen-
erals defeated several Division I
and II teams, including an upset
over a tough Division I George
Washington team. +

Although the Generals had an
impressive season, their perfor-
mance was not flawless. In their

attempt to retain their 1983
championship title, the Generals
placed second at the ODAC
championships.

Franke said, ‘‘The ODACs
were a little of a disappoint-
ment.’’ Franke believes that the
team’s ODAC tournament per-
formance marks the only perfor-
mance this season in which the
Generals did not play up to their
expectations. He added, how-
ever, that the champion, Lynch-
burg, may simply be a better
team.

Although they were unable to
defend their ODAC title, the
Generals posted very im-
pressive statistics in ODAC play.
In addition to a 3-4 record, W&L
won 21 of the 23 matches played
against its ODAC opponents dur-
ing the regular season.

Senior Craig Cannon (captain)
and freshman Roby Mize quali-
fied to participate in singles and
doubles competition at the
NCAA Division III National
Championships at Emory Uni-
versity in Atlanta, Ga. Cannon
(14-7 in ’84) entered the tourna-
ment ranked 23rd in the nation
among Division III players.
Mize (14-9) entered ranked 35th;
the doubles team of Cannon-
Mize (13-7) was 24th.

Cannon suffered a first round
loss in singles competition. Dean
Packard of Wittenberg defeated
Cannon 6-1, 6-4. Franke believes
that Craig was a little tight and
meted that Packard was playing
well. Packard upset the no. 3
seed of the tournament in the
second round.

Mize obtained a first round
victory, but was stopped in the

second round. Mize defeated
David Ulrich of SUNY-Albany
6-4, 6-3, but Duke Paluett of
Gustavus Adolphus (the no. 2
team in Division III) stopped
Mize, 6-1, 6-4, in the next round.

“Roby played well, but was
unable to take him (Paluett), a
very good player, out of his
groove,’’ said Franke.

The luck of the draw went
against Cannon and Mize in
doubles competition as they
faced the no. 7 seed team of Tim
Corwin and Alex Palledino from
Kalamazoo in the first round.
Cannon and Mize played a tough
match against Corwin and Pal-
ladino before losing 6-4, 6-4. Cor-
win and Palladino reached the
quarterfinals of the tournament.

Coach Franke would have
liked to have seen Cannon obtain
All-American honors _ this
season. He believes that Cannon
had the potential to be an All-
American and that he played
well enough during the regular
season, but that Cannon did not
play well enough at the national
tournament to achieve All-
American status.

Cannon, who will graduate this
year, did receive the tennis
team’s MVP award. Jim Irwin
and Charles Kalocsay will also
graduate this year. Coach
Franke appreciates the ability
and leadership that the seniors
have contributed to the tennis
program during their career at
W&L.

The members of the 1984 varsi-
ty team who will return next
year are Roby Mize, Andy Har-
ing, Scott Adams, Randy Johns
and John Meloy.

Grand jury indictments

(continued from page 1)

Dean of Students Lewis G.
John said that drug awareness
programs have been instituted
in physical education classes,
and that next fall’s freshman
orientation will include a presen-
tation on drugs.

In addition, a task force on
substance abuse was formed in
January as an ad hoc committee
of the Student Health Commit-
tee. It grew to include 20
members, including students,
administrators and others. It
recently issued a statement on
alcohol abuse.

Dean John said the committee
was formed partly as a result of
the grand jury, and partly in
response to the conviction last
fall of three former W&L
students on drug charges, in-
cluding possession and distribu-
tion of marijuana or cocaine.

‘““You have to look at the whole
range of drugs,’’ Dean John
said. ‘‘The most widely used and
abused substance here is
alcohol.”

He said the investigation has
had an effect on campus. “I
think it has probably cut down on
the use,” he said. “From
students I’ve. talked to, it has
either reducéd the level of usage
or driven it further under-
ground.”

‘Although the enforcement of
law is not within the educational
function of the University, no
one should delude himself that
the campus is a sanctuary from
law-enforcement agents,’’ the
University Policy Statement on
Drugs says.

‘‘Law-enforcement agents
have jurisdiction on campus
and, when possessing proper
documents, may legally make
arrests or search any room or

building without prior notice to

University officials.”’

Cases concerning alleged drug
misuse are referred to the Stu-
dent Control Committee.

VMI said in a statement that it
“has a clear and rigorously en-
forced policy on drug abuse: the
use is not tolerated; the penalty
is dismissal.”

Col. William J. Buchanan,
director of admissions, said the
school attempts to check any in-
formation it receives concerning
drug abuse by a potential cadet,
and that ‘‘any conviction beyond
a misdemeanor makes them in-
eligible for commissioning [as a
military officer], and that
makes them ineligible for us.”’

He said that the son of an
alumn wasrecently denied ad-
mission because of a drug-

related conviction.

Capt. Harold A. Willcockson,
deputy commandant of cadets,
said that ‘‘it’s against the rules
to use drugs here. Our purpose is
to identify a user and get him out
of here...We don’t have a pro-
gram dealing with rehabilita-
tion.”’

The special grand jury said in
its conclusions that ‘‘the local
public school administrations
should be urged to implement
within their curricula strong and
meaningful drug abuse clases,
commencing with Grade 4 and
continuing through high
school...”

“It is quite evident, based
upon the testimony of many, that
the majority of college students
who are ‘heavy users’ started
their drug connections in the
eighth or ninth grades,’’ the

Lee and how a move to coeduca-
tion would affect them.

“T’ve prepared some leading
questions which will suggest and
stimulate conversation on the in-
tangibles,’’ he said. ‘‘I've chosen
some of the things which are us-
ed by those most opposed to
coeducation for Washington and
Lee to test what they say against
our own judgments.”

As examples, he cited ‘‘We
will lose our distinctiveness’’
and ‘‘We’ll become just like all
the other coed schools in
America.”’

Wilson said the Academic Af-
fairs Committee, headed by
Edgar F.. Shannon Jr. of Charlot-
tesville, will take up ‘“‘the ques-
tion of what the University’s

 

report stated.

The jury said it hoped the com-
munity would form a citizens’
committee to implement pro-
grams to educate the public on
the dangers of narcotics abuse.
It said that guidelines from pro-
grams of’ other communities
were included with the report.
The guidelines were not releas-
ed.

Honts said in the statement
that it was his understanding
that Commonwealth’s Attorney
Beverly C. ‘‘John’’ Read plans to:
coordinate his activity with
regard to indictments with
former U.S. Attorney Leigh B.
Hanes of Fincastle, who was ap-
pointed in April to assist the
panel as a special counsel.

‘My appointment was con-
cerned with the examination of
one particular witness,’’ Hanes

academic prospects are — how
good the classes are, what the
admissions picture is, how im-
portant it is that we maintain our
all-male character, and what the
impact in the classroom would
be of an increase in the size of
the student body.”’

The Budget and Audit Com-
mittee, headed by Jerry G.
South of San Francisco, will look
at three sets of enrollment pro-
jections, and will study the
capital costs involved in a possi-
ble move to coeducation.

One model shows, over an 11-
year period, an undergraduate
student body of 1,000 if W&L
remained all-male, a decline of
350 from the current level.

“I don’t believe fatalistically
that it needs to be, but it’s a

said. ‘‘There were various
reasons for that which I am not
at liberty to discuss.”

Hanes said he ended up ex-
amining more than one witness
on the matter in question. He
said Monday that he had not yet
seen a copy of the jury’s report,
which was submitted to Honts on
May 10.

W&L law professor J. Timothy
Philipps is a member of the local
bar association committee
which is seeking comments and
complaints from citizens on ‘‘the
orderly administration of justice
in Rockbridge County,” in-
cluding the special grand jury.

‘“‘We thought we’d hear from a
lot of people and we just didn’t,
so we decided to take some in-
itiative,”’ he said. ‘‘We waited
for a long time and we got

nothing by just waiting for
volunteers.’’

Philipps said that a_ letter
soliciting comments was sent
Wednesday to local lawyers, law
enforcement agents and school
administrators. He said the let-
ter was also sent to the incoming
and outgoing presidents of the
Student Bar Association.

“The law school donated the
typing and preparation of the let-
ter,” he said, adding that the bar
association paid for the postage.

“lve gotten very little
material from people,” Philipps
said. He said he received com-
plaints from two W&L student:
involving ‘‘peripheral problems
with the police.”’

“They felt the police were do-
ing their job, but a little more
zealously than need be,”’ he said.

 

possibility we have to con-
template if we keep our quality
standards high,”’ Wilson said.
The other two models which
are being studied show a com-
bination of 1325 or 1500 men and

women undergraduates.
The Campus Life Committee,

chaired by H. Gordon Leggett
Jr. of Lynchburg, will study the
effects of coeducation on the
athletic program, residence hall
life, the fraternity system and
social life in general.

The Planning and Develop-
ment Committee, chaired by
S.L. Kopland Jr. of Memphis,
will study and present to the
Board the data collected from a
recent six-page questionnaire
exploring attitudes toward the
University and toward the
possibility of coeducation which

killed later in the day.

All three local network af-
filiates, WSET in Lynchburg
and WSLS and WDBJ in Roa-
noke, were notified by students
and dispatched reporters and
cameramen to Wilson’s office.

The amount of coverage of the
event prompted some to criticize
its purpose.

“The thing that ticks me is
that they called a_ reporter
first,’ associate professor of
journalism Robert J. de Maria
said. ‘By going to a professional

reporter, that made me question
their real purpose.”

“They were making a scene
for the media and for the Board
of Trustees,” he continued.
“They accomplished nothing.
They were calling attention to
themselves, not the issue... .
They were protesting, but did
that protest really accomplish
anything in the eyes of the
public?”’

Junior Gib Kerr, one of the
leaders of the group, defended
the sit-in. ‘‘We’re not radicals,”
he said. ‘‘We didn’t do this out of
disrespect. We didn’t mean any
disrespect for President Wilson
or his office. We just wish they'd
pay more attention to our opin-
ion.

‘‘We just thought this would be
the most effective way to get our
opinion across to the trustees.”’

Wilson said he was ‘‘incredu-
lous” when notified Wednesday
night of the possibility of a sit-in.

“I didn’t think that was the
W&L style,’’ Wilson said last
night. “If the students had come
in to talk, it seems that would
have been more the W&L style.
But I couldn’t see them calling

the media and then asking other
students to join them in
something like that. For those
reasons, I thought it had all the
earmarks of being rather ar-
tificial.”’

Wilson was attending the
Board of Trustees meetings all
day and was never in his office
during the sit-in.

Betty Brewbaker, Wilson’s
secretary arrived at 8:20 to find
the students in Wilson’s office.
Allen Cohen of WSET met her as
she walked up the stairs, she
said.

When she first saw the
students, Mrs. Brewbaker said,
she felt ‘‘shame and indignation
that they would be in (Wilson’s)
office, sitting in his chairs. Once
the initial shock was over, I just

. went along with it.”’

Mrs. Brewbaker said the
students obviously had con-
tacted the media. ‘‘They came
prepared to meet the media,”’
she added. ‘‘I really don’t know
what they hoped to accomplish
in the process.”’

“I told them they’ll have ever
somuch more fun at Goshen.”

was Sent to 16,500 alumni.

Wilson said that nearly 6,700
alumns_ returned the forms,
which were tabulated and
analyzed by a _ Richmond
marketing firm.

The president said he is uncer-
tain how much of the material
from the survey will be released.
“In some form it would want to
be shared,’’ he said. ‘I don’t
know what form that will take.”’

The Board’s Nominating and
Investment committees did not
undertake separate studies of
coeducation.

The Executive Committee of
the Student Body last night
hosted a dinner for the trustees,
at which several members of the
committee spoke on their ‘‘Per-
ceptions of Washington and
Lee.”

“It seemed like the most
expedient, courteous and effec-
tive way of maintaining open
lines of communication between
the student body and _ the
trustees,’’ EC President Robert
C. Jenevein said.

“T think it’s a good idea every
year, but it was initiated this
year because of all the hot issues
and the need to maintain those
open lines of communication.”’

Other items on the Board’s
agenda include final approval of
the University pavilion, which is
expected to be completed by
next fall, and the inauguration of
trustee Thomas K. Wolfe Jr. of
New York, who was unable to at-
tend the February meeting.

One matter the trustees will
not have to deal with is the fiscal
dispute between the Executive
Committee and the Student Bar
Association, which had said it
might present the issue to the
trustees.

An agreement was reached
between the SBA, represented
by a group headed by Chairman-
elect John J. Sicilian, and
representatives of next year’s
EC headed by Cole Dawson.

‘It’s all going to be worked out
by next fall,’’ Dawson said at
Monday’s EC meeting. ‘‘So the
trustees won’t be involved at
all.”
