Honor System
To Be Applied

In Gymnasium

Student body president Tim Ire-
land appeared before the Interfra-
ternity Council last night and urged
the house presidents to impress upon
their members and pledges the im-
portance of the new interpretation
of the honor system in regard to
the gym. The new _ interpretation
states that the Honor System ap-
plies in the gym as it does elsewhere.

Ireland stated that the theft of
socks and other athletic equipment
has been overlooked in the past, but
that it will not be overlooked any
longer. The EC decided last spring
to make this clarification of the
Honor System because of the con-
fusion concerning the Honor Sys-
tem’s application in the physical
education department.

In his speech he urged the house
pledge trainers to speak to the
freshmen on the Honor System, es-
pecially emphasizing this new inter-
pretation. He again reminded the
house presidents that ignorance is
no excuse for an Honor System vio-
lation.

IFC Stresses
Assimilation

A resolution bringing to bear
the influence of fraternities in as-
similating freshmen into the student
body was passed last night by the
Interfraternity Council.

Pledge training will now include
the traditions of conventional dress,
speaking, the beanie, and keeping
off the grass.

At a meeting of the Assimilation
Committee later last night, chair-

Academic Expansion Results In

Lower Quality College Student

Academic freedom in America is
being threatened by “indiscrimin-
ate expansion” of colleges and uni-—
versities, said Dr. Russell Kirk in-
a speech at duPont Hall September |
20.

A lecturer and nationally syndi-|
cated columnist, Kirk was speaking |
at a meeting sponsored by the W&L
Conservative Society. Academic per- |
fection, said Kirk, has often been |
lost in the race to enroll more stu-_
dents. Professors and university of- |
ficials aiming for excellence have

12-Inch Album
Released By
W&L Glee Club

The Glee Club has produced a
12-inch long-playing record which
will be ready for distribution in
about two weeks.

Theme for the feature side of the
first record is “Great Choruses.” The
reverse side theme is “Glee Club
Favorites.”

The first album is entitled “The
Sixties” and subsequent ones made
during the 1960’s will carry the
same title with different selections.
Plans call for future albums to
have a feature side with current
“Glee Club Favorites” on the re-
verse side.

Included in the “Great Choruses”
feature side of Volume I are Haydn's
“Creation,” Handel’s “The Messiah”
and Faure’s “Requiem.” The reverse
side of the initial record includes
such club favorites as the Univer-
sity’s Alma Mater, “College Friend-
ships,” Greig’s “Brothers Sing On!”
and “Landsighting,’ Schubert's
Widerspruch” and J. S. Bach's
“Good Fellows Be Merry” plus two
spirituals and Ferguson’s “I Want
Two Wings.”

This first record was cut from
tapes of Glee Club Concerts. Dr.
Edward F. Turner, Jr., head of
Washington and Lee’s physic de-
partment and club recording engi-
neer, taped the performances. The
voices of the members of the Long-
wood and Sullins college choirs are
combined with the Washington and
Lee Glee Club in the chorus selec-
tions.

Albums will be available in the
university’s Supply Store and from
Professor Stewart.

The Glee Club has selected 23
new members from over 40 men au-
ditioning for positions. These new
members include first tenors Randy
Williams and Fred Taussing, and
second tenors, Dick Donovan, Chris-
topher Clark, Jeff Williams, Charles
Fishburne, Randy H. Lee, Herbert
Mitchell, and Spencer Sullivan.

New baritones are Robert Vaughn,
Lance Heillmann, Bob Larus, Scott
Lavery, Gene Hatfield, Frank Wake-
field, and Roy Tyler, Everett Rob-
erts, Dave Miller and Maurice Fliess.

Chosen for the bass section of the
club were Bruce Cooper, Sandy
Vance, Jon Neergaard, and Charlie
Jones.

 

 

Dr. Russell Kirk
The dangers of mass education.

| Kirk; but the question of commun-

_naive” the view that complete free-

positions in the process, which Kirk
described as “by no means infre-
quent.”

The danger from mass education
is a far greater threat than the in-
filtration of communism into the
system, according to Kirk. He called
the question of allowing communist

The question of communism is
now seldom a “clear and present

“very

dom of expression should always be
allowed to communism. The idea, he
said, does not constitute academic
freedom. On the other hand he con-
demned those who want to forbid
any discussion of communism to
students.

academic freedom is internal, said

the speaker. He accused university '
officials and faculty committees of |

stated, these men speak of academic |

Kirk also pointed out the appear- |
ance of pressure groups new to
education which can stifle academic |

23 Less Dibels
In Frosh Class

By SHANNON JUNG

Freshmen enrolled at W&L from
Deep South states number only 116
this year as against 139 for the same
area last year, according to figures
released by Dean of Admissions
Frank J. Gilliam.

These figures reveal a drop of 23
Southerners enrolled in the freshman
class. Excluding Virginia men, the
University has enrolled only 57
freshmen from the combined states
of North and South Carolina, Ten-
nessee, Alabama, Louisiana, Georgia,
Mississippi, Arkansas and Florida.
Fifty-seven men out of a class of
334 come from the Deep South.

The novelty of this change can
be revealed by quotes found in the
University publications: “A school

| predominantly for Southern gentle-

men...the most typical Southern
university.” That these quotes per-
tain to W&L as do the above statis-
tics is paradoxical.
CEEB Tests

Washington and Lee is the first
Southern men’s school to require
that its freshman candidates take
the CEEB Achievement Tests. Dean
Gilliam reasoned that since W&L
was the only Southern men’s school
to require these tests, many southern
boys have been “scared off.” Many
boys, fearing the implications of
this requirement, may have decided
to attend another school. Although
this program is in its first year, only
four of the twelve Test medians
fell below the 550 mark.

Southern enrollment may have
plunged, but at the same time, SAT
scores soared, College Board medians
of the class of 66 have leaped a
whopping fifteen points over last
year’s freshman medians. Figures
released by Dean Gilliam show that
the verbal median has jumped from

| 565 to 580; the math median—from

599 to 614.

Medians Improve

As SAT medians increased, the
percentage of public school candi-
dates enrolled at W&L also rose—
from 55 per cent to 59 per cent.
Private school percentage dropped
from 45 per cent to 41 per cent. The
55-45 per cent relationship had been
static for some years before this.

size of their pledge classes from
last year and 10 dropped in number,
while only one retained the same
size. Kappa Sigma showed the big-
gest increase by jumping from 12
to 26. Delta Tau Delta, by dropping
from 25 to 12, showed the greatest
loss.

Kappa Sigma led the fraternities
numerically with a pledge class of
26; second was Zeta Beta Tau with
22. Beta Theta Pi and Kappa Alpha
tied for third place with 18 each.

The Interfraternity Council voted
last night to make the waiting period
for deferred rush three weeks in-
stead of the usual four. Eighty-two
freshmen will be eligible for the
deferred rush program, which will
begin on October 13.

The reasons varied, and current
indications seem to suggest that
many freshmen are planning to
pledge during deferred rush.

The fraternities and their pledges
are as follows:

Beta Theta Pi: Calvin Burton,

Rhodes, Fulbright Scholarships, Wilson Fellowships

 

Valuable Graduate Aid Available

Applications for Rhodes and Ful-
bright Scholarships and Woodrow |
Wilson Fellowships must be com-|
pleted during the month of October, |
according to statements published
by the sponsors of the grants. |

Candidates for Rhodes Scholar-|
ships should see Professor Fitzgerald |
Flournoy not later than September |
27, in order that their names may |
be presented to the faculty meeting
October 1. Candidates should be}
seniors and should have high grades, |
as well as a marked degree of dis-|
tinction in campus activities or ath-
leties. |

Candidates may apply either in|
the district in which they hold resi- |
dence, or in any district in which|
they have received at least two years
of college training.

 

A Rhodes Scholar may choose any
course of instruction offered at

 

Oxford, and will hold Senior Status
upon entrance,

Wilson Fellowships

Dean William W. Pusey called at-
tention this week to the Woodrow
Wilson National Fellowships, and
requested that interested students
consult both with their major pro-
fessors and with himself.

The Wilson foundation each year
fully supports more than a thousand
selected Fellows in their first year of
graduate work, with the aim of en-
couraging young men and women to
consider careers in college teaching.

A Fellow receives $1,500 for the
year’s study, plus dependency allow-
ance, and the Foundation also pays
tuition and fees.

Woodrow Wilson Fellows are usu-
ally students in the humanities and
social sciences, but in exceptional
cases and when a clear preference

 

for a teaching career is demonstrat-
ed, candidates in mathematics or the
natural sciences may also be con-
sidered.

Fulbright Grants

Information about Fulbright
Scholarships may be obtained from
Dr. Charles Turner. The Fulbright
grants are government scholarships
made available for graduate study
or research abroad under the Ful-
bright-Hays Act .

Fulbright grants are administered
by the Institute of International edu-
cation and provide round-trip trans-
portation, tuition and maintenance
for one academic year in any one
of 46 countries.

Dr. Turner stated that Washington
and Lee sent two Fulbright Schol-
ars last year, of ten applicants from
the university. He said that W&L
has had as many as six in one
year in the past.

The Honor System: W&L’s Most Valuable Asset

Last year, the Tuesday Edition asked Dr.
Sidney Coulling, Associate Professor of Eng-
lish, to write his ideas concerning the Honor
System.

Dr. Coulling’s efforts resulted in the fol-
lowing article, which we feel is one of the best
explanations ever rendered to the tradition
that stands as the most singularly important
aspect of Washington and Lee.

For this reason, we are re-printing Dr.
Coulling’s article. We sincerely hope that it
will be read with care by both freshmen and
upperclassmen alike.

By DR. SIDNEY M. B. COULLING
Associate Professor of English

If everyone who knows Washington and Lee well
were asked to select the single most valuable asset
of the University, I have little doubt that the choice
would be almost unanimous—our honor system.

From time to time, I know, there has been vigorous
competition from other quarters: a Gator Bowl football
team, a sensationally successful group on the radio
Quiz Bowl, an historian of international fame, a new
endowment enthusiastically applauded by educators
throughout the country.

But year in and year out it has been the honor sys-
tem, more than anything else, that has placed Wash-
ington and Lee in its distinguished position in Ameri-
can education.

It is the honor system that has made possible much
of the characteristic life of the college community,
from unproctored examinations to the unquestioning
acceptance of student checks.

It is the honor system that has helped to create
an environment in which serious intellectual pursuits
are possible and in which excellence is respected.

And, as I learned again last summer when I was
among Washington and Lee’s representatives at a
conference in Colorado Springs, it is the honor system
that attracts more praise and more interest, among
students and educators from New England to Cali-
fornia, than anything else that can be mentioned about
the University.

This is so because, of all we can boast here, our
genuinely effective honor system is the one thing that
is shared by only a handful of institutions in the nation.

Dangers of Complacency

All of this seems so obvious that it hardly needs to
be said. And yet in recent years I have increasingly
sensed that we do not sufficiently appreciate the true
importance of the honor system. Even with the scandal
of the early fifties only a decade behind us we are

Che Ring-tum Phi

Tuesday Edition

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

prone to regard the honor system with complacency,
to accept it as the natural course of things, to consider
it simply as something here that is old and traditional.

Too many of us, I am afraid, are either unaware or
forgetful of what exists where there is no honor sys-
tem, casually dismissing the matter with the tired
old witticism about the faculty with the honor and the
students with the system. We tend to think that in-
evitably Washington and Lee will always have an hon-
or system, and that the loss or weakening of the
honor system “can never happen here.” Or, if I may
judge by themes I read now and then, we are tempted
to speak of “the three great Washington and Lee tra-
ditions—conventional dress, the speaking tradition, and
the honor system,” as if a student’s integrity is on
the same level of importance as his custom of wearing
a jacket and speaking to his friends.

Cheating Condoned Elsewhere

If I regard our honor system as pre-eminently im-
portant, the reason is that I have had first-hand ex-
perience with the immense problems that are created
in institutions with inadequate honor systems, or no
honor system at all.

My first teaching assignment, for example, was at
a large state university which had an honor system
supported largely by elaborate rhetorical claims. Once
when I reported a student for submitting an essay that
he had copied from the New York Herald Tribune I
caused a stir which affected the entire campus and
lasted for weeks. Although the penalty for such an
offense—failure in the course and expulsion for a sem-
ester—was clearly and explicitly stated in a book of
regulations, the student and administrative authorities
sought every possible evasion.

No one seemed too remote from the case to help de-
cide it; no testimony was too irrelevant to include.
The student’s minister at home wrote to say that his
family were pillars of the church; his dormitory coun-
selor testified that he rarely kept late hours or created
disturbances; and some of his other professors said
that in class he seemed pleasant and attentive. Even-
tually I was notified by a dean that since most of the
evidence pointed to the conclusion that the accused
was really a prince of a fellow who had somehow mis-
taken an article in the Herald Tribune for one of his
own essays, I should forget the whole matter and per-
mit the student to write another paper.

At a second institution where I taught there was not
even the pretense of an honor system, for the students
were so accomplished in deception that the faculty
and administration had long since abandoned any ser-
ious attempt to deal with the problem. One of my
students, a third-string fullback who had made him-
self valuable as the extra-point specialist, was so skill-
fully assisted in his work that only late in the semester,
and then by accident, did I discover that in reality he
was scarcely literate.

Another student was a cheater so clumsy that he
was repeating English 1 for the fourth time, but he

was beginning to learn. He came to class one day to
write an impromptu theme, pulled out an old issue of
The Reader’s Digest, and began copying one of its
articles of condensed but lasting interest. When I
challenged him he replied that he was.merely taking
notes in preparation for the paper—the paper he was
supposed to be writing at that very moment! Both of
us knew that was an outrageous lie, but both also
knew that I was utterly powerless to do anything
about it. Had I tried to take the matter to the admin-
istration I would have experienced the same treatment
which a colleague received when he attemped to press
an honor case. He was accused by his dean of being a
trouble maker and was encouraged to seek a teaching
position elsewhere.

All-importance of Honor System

However absurd such incidents may seem, however
foreign they are to our experience at Washington and
Lee, it is salutary to be reminded that such things can
and do happen every day on campuses throughout the
country. If we speak of the honor system with some-
thing other than glibness and complacency, we must
always keep in mind what the absence of an honor
system can do.

It can sap the vitality of an institution. It can make
a travesty of the whole educational process. It can
create an atmosphere of mutual hostility between
faculty and students and demoralize everyone by es-
tablishing a mood of cynicism and futility.

I have insisted on this point because I believe there
is danger in complacency. But there is a second danger,
I think, still more serious—the tendency, apparently
growing in recent years, to subject the honor system
to a scrutiny that obscures rather than illuminates.

I do not mean that we should never examine or
discuss the honor system. Certainly the lively debate
of this past spring was a good and healthful sign.
Nor do I mean that the honor system is sacred or per-
fect, that it should be immune from criticism. If there
are faults and weaknesses then by all means they
should be corrected.

But there is a difference between an examination
of the honor system that is useful and an examination
of it that is not, and I am not sure that we have always
observed this distinction.

The Meaning of Honor

In the past few months, for example, I have heard
the complaint that in applying the honor system we
face a vast difficulty because of our inability to de-
fine what we mean by honor. I hope that I am not
being semantically naive when I say that I cannot be-
lieve we have any real difficulty here. I think thta we
know in general what we mean by the word, and even
if we cannot adequately define it we at least know
what is not honest. We know that lying and stealing
and cheating are not honest, and we know what lying
and stealing and cheating are.

‘NKRUMAH NEVER DIES...’

 

 

Honor And Athletics

This year’s Executive Committee will, for the first time in
many years, enforce the Honor System in the Athletic De-
partment. In the past, the Athletic Department has been con-
sidered by the student body to be a “fringe area’? where any-
thing short of grand larceny was considered acceptable.

But “fringe areas,” with their inherent contradictions, can
do nothing but weaken an Honor System. The members of the
Athletic Department, by promising their full support of the
EC’s decision, have done much to promote the spirit of Honor

at Washington and Lee.

A Good Start

oF

IFC President Ross Kyger and Rush Chairman Tony
Schlesinger did an excellent job with Rush Week this year.
Rush rules were strictly enforced, and the schedule for the

hectic week was carried out with precision.

The future of W&L’s fraternity system may very well de-
pend on the IFC’s performance this year. If the fraternities,
acting through the IFC, cannot iron out the wrinkles in the
fraternity system, then the faculty will more than likely feel
obliged to take stern measures. The IFC is blessed with strong
and capable leadership, but without fraternity support, it is

powerless.

So let a word to the wise be sufficient. If fraternities at
W&L are to continue to enjoy their accustomed freedom, they
must accept the responsibility of sensible self-government.
The IFC is off to a good start. We hope the fraternities will
continue to provide the support necessary to keep the ball

rolling.

for his class, president of his fra-
ternity, and Phi Beta Kappa student,
spent eight weeks this summer in
Ghana. Sponsored by the Protestant
Episcopal Church summer work pro-

the people of Ghana).

With 23 other Americans, I left
New York via jet July 3, bound for
Agbozume, Ghana.

A West African republic of ap-
proximately seven million people,
Ghana is about the size of Oregon.
Formerly known as the Gold Coast,
she received her independence from
Britain in 1957 and remains in the
British Commonwealth.

African Socialism

In Accra, the capital city, a beau-
tiful arch commemorates Ghana’s
independence, and on it is the in-
scription “Freedom and _ Justice.”
The country’s economy is something
called African Socialism, a term no
one could really explain to me. The
country is led by a one-party, sup-
posedly neutral government.

Among the Ghanians themselves
there are varying levels of intelli-
gence and financial income, just as
in this country. In the South, where
European influence has been felt
more strongly, education and good
living conditions are emphasized.
The dress is largely western, and
white men are a common sight.

As you travel north, life becomes
more a kin to the past. Traditional

they are an extremely friendly and

The honor system was never intended to be the
object of metaphysical or semantic speculation. It is a
very practical system of assuring that honorable be-
havior shall be the rule of life here, and to introduce
into it questions which lie outside its province is to
weaken it without purpose.

A second kind of unhelpful criticism is the demand
to have the application of the honor system described
in the most minute detail, to indicate precisely the
boundary between the area where it applies and the
area where it does not apply.

We need, of course, to know where we stand, and
obviously we must state what offenses are punishable
and what are not. But there is a danger in wishing to
be too specific. Just as the desire to know exactly
what pages of the text are included in the examination
material encourages one to study only what is abso-
lutely essential, so too does the insistence on minutely
describing the application of the honor system en-
courage one to avoid any unnecessary honesty.

Again I hope that I am not being naive when I say
that I think we know the area covered by the honor
system. Its strength, we are accustomed to repeating,
lies in its not being overloaded, in its applying to a
fairly restricted and well-defined area.

But this has always meant that the honor system is
strong because it has not attempted to regulate social
conduct. It has never meant that the honor system is
strong because it does not demand too much honor of
a student. It has never meant that honor can be com-
partmentalized, that stealing in a dormitory is for-
bidden but stealing in a fraternity house is permissible.

The word integrity suggests, etymologically, whole-
ness. We cannot have this “wholeness” if our concern
is with discovering what dishonorable deeds we can
get by with rather than with being honorable in all
that we say and do.

Long Tradition of Honor

Whatever may have been their inadequacies, the
students of Washington and Lee have at least made one
great and enduring contribution that is the bedrock
of everything else. They have developed, administered,
supported, and maintained the honor system as a vital
force in the University.

If the present and future students wish to make a
contribution, they can make no more significant one
than continuing the same tradition. But one thing they
may not do. They may not regard the honor system
as their exclusive possession. It is not theirs alone. It
belongs to every student who through the years has
faithfully helped establish it as an integral part of our
lives. For this reason the enjoyment of it is not simply
a right and a privilege, but a solemn responsibility as
well,

As Ruskin said of the architecture of the past, the
honor system is not ours to do with as we please. It is
ours only to preserve.

Meade Christian Reports On Ghana

 

short— for a net has been thrown,
over the country and it is being
drawn tighter each day.

I felt this net tightening while I
was there. It is the net of totalitar-
ianism, and in this respect it is not to
the advantage of the free world that
Ghana be the West African pace-
setter.

The Convention Peoples’ Party,
Ghana’s only recognized political
party, controls the country. Under
the Preventive Detention Act of 1958,
anyone whose freedom is judged by
the party to be not conducive to
the public good can be put in prison
for five years without trial.

Opposition Dwindles

The number of members of the
opposition in Parliament has dwin-
dled to five, and these dare not be
open with their criticism.

Significantly, most of the opposi-
tion among the Ghanians themselves
lies among the educated.

Ghana and countries like it may

and if this goal is kept alive by
seeing it fulfilled in a nation such as

and not the mockery it does now.

Booters Tackle
Pfeiffer; Frosh,
X-C Open Play

By JIM DE YOUNG

The varsity soccer team, practicing
for the last two weeks, opens its
season this Thursday against Pfeiffer
College of North Carolina. Four
starters are back from last year’s
squad: Co-captains Bob Pagano and
Tom Clements, Steve Hibbard, and
Tom Greene, All-Opponent Team
goalie in last year’s Lynchburg tour-
nament.

This year’s team will be a young
one, comprised of sophomores and
freshmen that will soon be moved up
to the varsity by Coach Joe Lyles.

Spirit and determination will be
two of the major factors in judging
the team’s outcome this season.

* * *

The General cross-country team
is again looking forward to a suc-
cessful season with seven lettermen
returning. Coach Dick Miller, while
customarily non-committal, is hope-
ful for a season record to match or
better last year’s 7-2 mark.

The returning lettermen this year
are: senior co-captains Mike Shank
and Mac Brownlee, senior Ed Gar-
retson, junior Bruce MacDonald, and
sophomores Rick Rodgers, Andy
Kilpatrick, and Dillard Munford.

Washington and Lee’s win happy
football team rolled to its 14th
victory Saturday, crushing Hamp-
den-Sydney, 15-6.

The win bettered the previous
school record of consecutive vic-
tories—13—set in 1913-1914. It was
also W&L’s straight triumph without
a defeat over a four-year span.

Yoffe Romps

Fleet halfback Stu Yoffe turned in
the game’s key play when he inter-
cepted a Fred Mitchell pass in the
W&L end zone and raced 92 yards
to the Hampden-Sydney nine in the

‘ first period.

The Tigers had gained control
when they recovered a fumbled punt
at the Generals’ five. Two running
plays and an incompleteed pass had
moved them to the two before Yoffe
turned the threat into a blessing.

It took the Generals just three
plays to captalize on the Tiger mis-
cue, with Yoffe going 4 yards around
left end for the tally. Mike Jenkins
converted and the score was 7-0.

In the second quarter W&L drove
to the H-S eight only to see the
drive stopped by a stout Tiger for-
ward wall.

Second Score

Early in the third quarter W&L
struck again.

Henry Sackett was the big man on
the drive, with a 48-yard run which

20.

Five plays later Tommy Keesee
plunged over for the touchdown.
Sackett, with a good block by Kee-
see, skirted right end to make the
score 15-0.

With four minutes remaining in
the game, the Tigers finally found
the touchdown range.

Using their star fullback Lewis
Everette on two key fourth down
plays, they went 88 yards in 19
plays.

Soucek capped the drive with a
16-yard touchdown run around left
end.

The Tigers gambled for the two-
pointer, but Chuck Lane stopped
Everette short of the goal.

 

 

 

carried him to the Hampden-Sydney |

 

End Threat

With the game practically out of
reach, Hampden-Sydney tried a suc-
cessful onside kick.

But Mike Sheffey picked off a
Tiger pass at the General 40-yard
line, and W&L was content to run
out the clock.

After the game Coach Lee Mc-
Laughlin looked over this year’s
prospects.

He said that W&L does not have
the defensive potential of last year’s

 

squad—the main difference being
the absence of Terry Fohs, a mem-
ber of last year’s little All-American
team.

Coach Mac seems to feel that the
next two games against Lebanon
Valley and Emory and Henry will
be the most crucial of the schedule.

In Coach Mac’s words the team
has yet to “jell,” and could be sur-
prised by either of these schools.

The Generals open their home sea-
son with Lebanon Valley this Satur-
day at 2 p.m.

a mere indoctrinator. The student
must seek rather than ask to be
told.

The foundation of academic free-
dom is the natural right of those
interested in truth, said Kirk. Al-
though there is no legal or contract-
ual basis for it, “academic freedom
naturally appertains to the academic
occupation.” When this law is dis-
regarded, Kirk said, “you curtail
genuine learning.”

Infringement on the academic
freedom of the students was mini-
mized by the speaker. He said that
it exists very little in the United
States ,although there is little stu-
dent freedom in some other coun-
tries.

Kirk supported the administration
of loyalty oaths to professors and
students, calling the requirement a
mark of honor. He saw no challenge
to freedom in a loyalty oath of
“dignified and general character.”
He condemned “badly phrased” or
frequently administered oaths.

Big Weekend Festivities

By KEN LANE
Assistant Managing Editor
Clyde McPhatter, one of Rock ’n’ Roll top-selling record-

ing artists, has been contracted to play for Opening Dances
on Friday night, October 19, Dance Board President Frank

The Troubadour Theatre will begin its 1962-63 season on
October 31 with the production of “Inherit the Wind” by
Lawrence and Lee. In addition to this premier production the
Troubs will also present Moliere’s ‘“Tartuffe” and a festival of

one-act plays to be directed by advanced students.
“Inherit the Wind,” which was a* 3 -

hit on Broadway and was later made
into a motion picture, centers around
the famous Scopes “monkey” trial of
the 1920’s. It was at this trial that
Clarence Darrow and William Jen-
nings Bryan, the two most famous
living orators of the time, met
face-to-face in the Tennessee court-
room in a battle that went beyond
the confines of that room.

The play has an unusually large
cast, with an opening for 25 roles.
Dr. Jones has auditioned 31 tryouts
and has announced the selection of
14. They are as follows: Bruce
Whelihan, Howard Schramm, Garret
Kratzig, Sid Parham, Harwich Stew-
art, Paul Balich, Pete Manson, War-
ren Montgomery, Bo Earnest, Rene
Reixach, Bill Atwell, Cary Williams,
and Drew Baur. Rehearsals began
last Wednesday night.

“Inherit the Wind” will be playing
from October 31 to November 3.
The second play, “Tartuffe,” is
scheduled for February 27-March 2;
and the third show, a festival of
one-act plays ,will be May 8-11.

The cost of admission wil be $3.00
for adults and $2.00 for students.
Dr. Jones stated that reservations
will be necessary for all the plays
and this includes subscribers of
season tickets as well.

Under the limitations of a small
theater and a restricted stage area,
the Troubadours have done an amaz-
ingly successful job in provding the
student body with top quality enter-
tainment. This year Dr. Jones antici-
pates an even more successful sea-
son.

Deb

By STEVE SMITH

The national debate topic under- |
went its first public scrutiny at|
Washington and Lee yesterday af-|
ternoon as Dr. John Gunn lectured
to about 50 boys on the question,
Resolved that the non-communist
nations of the world should unite in
an economic community.

Dr. Gunn’s lecture was the second
meeting this week for the debate
team. At the team’s initial meeting
Monday night 64 students, the larg-
est number ever to express interest
in debating at W&L, heard brief
talks from the school’s top debaters.

Also this week debate coach Wil-
liam Chaffin announced that the
team will open the 1962-63 sea-
with a television match
against Old Dominion College
(formerly William and Mary at
Norfolk) over WAVY-NBC,

son

In his lecture Dr. Gunn viewed
the question as representing the in-
fluence of three major trends in
Western civilization, the first being
the integration of small into large
political units. Economie union, he
said, is a step toward political union.
He used the example of German
unification having been hastened by
the establishment of the Zollverein,
a mere tariff union which tied to-
vether the small German states.

Integration of Nations
The second trend, said Dr. Gunn,
is toward political integration of
nations, resulting in international
organizations. This movement began
with diplomatic gathering of the

In addition to these historic trends,
said Dr. Gunn, the recent funda-
mental division between the Sino-
Soviet block and the Free World
bears directly on the debate topic.
This split has made it crucial that
the non-communist nations cooper-
ate with each other in order to re-
main free.

Having sketched this background
for the debate, Dr. Gunn explored
the possible arguments of the case.
The affirmative need for an economic
community is strong because of the
definite threat offered by commun-
ism. The benefits of the plan would
be increased prosperity, through
| more efficient use of resources, pro-
duction, and trade; and increased
unity in the West, which would en-
hance free world security against
the Soviets.

Young Pleased

Frank Young, president of the
Dance Board, is highly pleased with
this year’s results: “On behalf of
the Dance Board, I would like to
extend my appreciation to the stu-
dent body for its outstanding sup-
port Thanks to this splendid coop-
eration, we can assure W&L of an
unprecedented year of top quality
entertainment that can be matched

Also highlighting the dance will
be the selection and crowning of
this year’s Homecoming Queen,
which will take place during inter-
mission. The figure will consist of
a candidate for the honor from
each house, escorted by her date.

Having held the spotlight of pop-
ularity for 10 years, McPhatter has
kept record sales skyrocketing with
such hits as “Little Bitty Pretty
One,” “Lovey Dovey,” and “Ta Ta!”

“Clyde and his band _ specialize
not only in Rock 'n Roll, but also in
a variety of good dance music,”
Young remarked.

A native of Durham, N. C., Clyde
had a rich background of religious
music before being persuaded to
join the newly formed group, The
Dominoes. The young singer was
a smashing hit and a key figure in
the group’s orbit to fame. Among
the records which won The Domi-
noes their booming success were
“Do Something for Me,” “Have
Mercy, Baby,” and “These Foolish
Things.”

“Clyde's vocal tricks and _ his
effortless upper register crooning
style became the rage among vo-
cal groups and he was much copied
and imitatied,” one critic observes.

Clyde left the Dominoes in Sept.,
1953, to lead his own group, The
Drifters. Within two months after
they were formed, Clyde and his
group has recorded a big hit with
“Money Honey.” Other best-sellers
were “Such A Night,” “Honey Love,”
and “White Christmas,” the last
equalled in seasonal popularity only
by the Bing Crosby version.

In 1954, the star’s career was
interrupted by a call from Uncle
Sam. During his Army days, he
performed vocal solos at numerous
service shows. He was so successful
at this that he decided to go it
alone when discharged from the ser-
vice. During furloughs, he put out
such impressive releases as “Seven
Days.”

On his return to civilian life in
the spring of 1956, success began
to snowball, A fruitful nationwide
tour and a new record, “Treasure
of Love,” put Clyde on the pedes-
tal of fame.

“Clyde is a crowd pleaser; his
good looks and ingratiating person-
ality put the audience on his side
from the moment he steps from the
wings—his voice holds them after
that,” a critic remarked.

On numerous tours throughout the
country, Clyde has performed at
such outstanding theaters and clubs
as the Apollo in New York; the
Howard in Washington; the Royal
in Baltimore; and the Casino Theater
in Toronto.

A Warning—Before It’s Too Late

This is as good a time of the year as any to preach on traffic

safety and good driving habits. If the usual pattern holds, i

can be expected that three or four times during the year the

effect that

words of a similar nature. Like the man in the funny paper

says, they’ll do it every time.

Along this line, this seems to be an ideal opportunity to
reprint an old Ring-tum Phi editorial, dug out of our musty
files by the peons assigned to do such things.

Written by Phil Grose, editor of the Friday edition for the

1959-60 school year, this appeared on September

“Fun Behind the Wheel”

the title

Why not prove to your dates these next weekends
that you have a fast car. Wouldn’t that be fun?

Can you imagine the total thrill of seeing the joyous
sparkle in your date’s eyes as you carom about the

mountains this weekend?

You can both listen to the screaming tires—a sound
truly nicer than any symphony. And your date can ad-
mire your skill as you try to avoid the car ahead.

When you hit the car, your date will be thrown
through the windshield—if she is destined to be one of

the gay set.

And won’t she be fortunate, for the view from the
hood is so much better than from inside the car.

She won’t look as nice as she did back in the fra-
ternity house. But you can make up for that.

You can send her flowers. Won’t that make her

happy?

We agree with Editor Grose’s adroitly-expressed senti-
ments. Besides, if you go around smashing up cars and getting
blood and glass all over the roads, that makes them unsafe for

make things worse by speeding or littering them with what’s
left of your windshield. Take it easy, gentlemen.

Information Service Hit
For Poor Game Coverage

(Editor’s note. Though we sym-
pathize with our friends from Il-
linois, the below criticism is en-
tirely misdirected. Under arrange-
ments with the Associated Press,
the Washington and Lee Informa-
tion Services are responsible for
reporting only home games. More-
over, our university takes pride in
having one of the most efficient
Information Services in the coun-
try.)

Dear Editor:

We are recent graduates of Wash-
ington and Lee and are, naturally,
interested in events and activities
occuring on the campus this fall. We
are especially interested in the foot-
ball team which blossomed into an
exciting, winning team while we
were undergrads.

The team has been undefeated for
the past two seasons and has re-
ceived well deserved national rec-
ognition. Of course we want to fol-
low the team this fall, and we are
particularly interested in knowing
the scores of the games.

We were somewhat miffed both
yesterday and today when scores
were pouring in from all over the
nation with one notable exception.
Nowhere, and we repeat, nowhere
could we find the W&L vs. Hamp-
den-Sydney score.

Score Not Available

CBS was ready to give the team
national attention on its “College
Scoreboard Roundup” which follows
the “Game of the Week” and is,
we're sure, watched by sports fans
throughout the nation, but the score
was announced as not available.
CBS had obviously hoped to give
the score because they had taken
the trouble to list the game on their
scoreboard.

We doubt that
next week since

will do this
want to give

scores, not waste space. They were
able to obtain some scores from
remote Virginia since they had the
GW vs. VPI game report from}
Roanoke along with many other
scores from the South.

Nonetheless, we swallowed our
disappointment and directed our
efforts toward other forms of mass
media, We fully expected to be
able to pick up the score on the
radio with a minimum of diffi-
culty. As you have probably |
guessed by now, this also failed.

However, we went to bed with full
confidence that we would arise in
the morning and find the

Lee Chapel Restoration

Work is progressing on the eleven |

month project to restore
serve historic Lee Chapel,
pressive
ton and Lee campus.

Contract for
taking has been awarded to
John P. Pettyjohn Company
Lynchburg, President Cole said.

pre-

Restoration Funds

All funds for the project were
made available to Washington and
Lee last year by the Ford Motor
Company Fund of Dearborn,
Mich., to “help preserve one of
the South’s most prized land-
marks.” The Chapel is designated
as a National Historic Landmark
by the U.S. Department of The
Interior and is visited each year
by more than 30,000 persons.

Plans call for all work on
1963, in time for appropriate re-
dedication ceremonies at the close
of the University’s academic year,
President Cole said.

Built in 1867

Although the Chapel was con-
structed under General Robert E.
Lee’s supervision in 1867, the red
brick structure will be restored as
it existed in 1883, the year an addi-
tion to the building was made to
house the Lee family mausoleum and
the chamber containing the famous
Valentine recumbent statute of Lee.

Engaged as consulting architects
for the project was the Boston firm
of Perry, Shaw, Hepburn and Dean,
restoration experts who planned and
supervised the restoration of Colon-
ial Williamsburg. Specifications for
the Chapel work were drawn up by
the University architects Clark, Nex-
sen and Owen of Lynchburg.

Although the emphasis is on
restoration, President Cole said,
plans call for extensive improve-
ments which will assure the future
preservation of the Chapel and
its valuable contents. These will
include structural strengthening,
flreproofing, and air-conditioning,
the latter an aid in preserving a
million-dollar art collection in
the Chapel and hundreds of items
of Lee memorabilia in the Chapel’s
museum.

Experts

Restoration experts also have rec-
ommended certain changes in the
display of art work, museum items,
and the recumbent statute which
they believe will enhance the
Chapel’s appeal to the thousands of

All items in the Chapel have
been catalogued carefully in
preparation for storage or display

campus to participate in this uni-
versity’s social program. Anyone in-
terested in guest tickets for Open-
ings Dances should write the Dance
Board, Post Office Box 458 in Lex-
ington.

Variety will be the key word of
this year’s University-sponsored
social functions. Variety not only
in the type of entertainment, but
also in the theme, setting, and
staging of each dance and concert.
In regard to entertainment, out-
standing performers in the fields
of rock and roll, folk music, mod-
ern jazz, and society dance music
will appear on the campus during
the major weekends,

The selection and crowning of
the Homecoming Queen during the
Friday night dance of October 19
should add a great deal to the
Openings Dance’ program. The
Dixieland Jam session planned for
the Fancy Dress Ball is a new touch
which should add a bit of variety to
that function.

New

In regard to setting and staging
effects, several innovations will be
made this year. An electrical, self-
contained water fountain has been
purchased by the Dance Board to
aid in the decorations of both dances
and concerts. Colored disc spot-
lighting will be standard equipment
at all of the concerts this season.
There is a strong possibility that a
dual staging system will be effected

Though Rush

these two, plus a good crop of
freshmen, made it quite a success-

Lebanon Valley Challenges
WGL,; 20 Unbeaten Games

By NICK MONSARRAT
Assistant Sports Editor

The Generals will face a definite
weight problem this Saturday as
they hope to lengthen their twenty
game unbeaten streak against Leb-
anon Valley College in Lexington.

Boasting the best year in their
history last season Lebanon comes
to Lexington with a 6-1 record
and 225-pound tackle Glenn
Stetch who has gained much re-
spect from players and coaches
alike for speed and ability.

With thirteen lettermen returning,
nine of whom were starting last
year, the visitors from Pennsylvania
look to be a strong and heavy team.
Coach Lee McLaughlin cited quar-
terback Wes MacMillian and full-
back Fred Porrino as especially dan-
gerous to the lighter W&L line.

Yoffe May Be Out

Th Generals, just fresh from last
week’s 15-6 victory over Hampden-
Sydney, may be forced to play
without the services of halfback Stu
Yoffe due to a pulled leg muscle.
It is hoped that treatment may solve
the problem but no definite decision
has yet been reached as to his
condition.

In the case that he is sidelined, he
will be replaced by Jay Norman
who will be moved up from the Gold
or third unit.

John McDaniel has been named
as the starter at offensive quarter-
back for the Generals but Chuck
Lane will share the job throughout
the afternoon.

 

Bad Tires!

Some of the Turnpikes now
are barring autos that have
defective tires. Officials re-
port that over 30% of this
year’s fatal accidents on the
Pennsylvania Turnpike have
been caused by bad tires.

The main W&L weakness seems
to lie in the center of the line and
off tackle where the visitors have
a definite weight advantage, but it
is hoped that speed will be the de-
ciding factor in W&L’s favor.

Question of Depth

Also, the depth which was used so
much to the Generals’ favor last
year, may again appear with this
year’s Gold team. Coach Mack feels
that while they lack the experience
of last year’s third unit, they still
have the eagerness and drive to do
the job of backing up the first two
units. This year’s Gold team _ is
composed entirely of sophomores
with the exception of one junior.

Th Lebanon team is coached
by Bill McHenry, who was the
captain of the 1953 Washington
and Lee squad and who is the
brother of Washington and Lee
lacrosse and basketball coach Bob
McHenry.

Sharper Passing
And Teamwork

Aid In Victory

By DICK KREITLER

Washington and Lee’s soccer team
won its season opener with Pfeiffer
College by a score of 2-1, yesterday.

The W&L booters controlled play
throughout the game, but failed to
come through with the winning tal-
lies until the fourth period.

In the first half the Generals
had several scoring opportunities,
but bad luck and misplaced shots
on the extremely muddy field
hindered a score.

Co-captain Bob Pagano, although
he didn’t score, was undoubtedly the
outstanding player for the Generals.
His play making set up both goals
and aided in W&L’s domination of
the waterlogged ball.

Pfeiffer finally broke the scoring
ice late in the third period as two
of their players managed to get
past W&L’s secondary defense to
score.

A fired-up W&L team, led by
Pagano, Steve Hibbard, and Bruce
Jackson, picked up steam as
Pfeiffer began to tire in the fourth
quarter.

Steve Hibbard came through with |
the score that evened the game by |
taking a well placed pass from!
Pagano and booting in a cross shot
from twenty yards out.

A few minutes late, Junior Jim
Mell set up the next goal for Wash-
ington and Lee as he looped a pass
in front of the net which was headed |
in by Charlie Sweet.

The Generals managed to hold
off Pfeiffer for the remaining nine-
minutes without too much trouble.

Freshman halfbacks Wes Horner
and Frank Wakefield were instru-
mental in the victory as they made
their varsity debut.

what is wrong with W&L’s informa-

It is hard enough for W&L to

We are constantly confused with

such as W&M, F&M, and a hest
of other double name schools,
Yet, when publicity is offered to
us, we either shun it or muff the

W&L Team Defends
Title November 16-17

Washington and Lee will be
host to the annual tournament
of the Virginia Tau Kappa
Alpha debate fraternity No-
vember 16-17 in the second
WéL defense of the district
debate championship.

Senior Bill Boardman, president
of the Virginia district of TKA, an-
nounced that invitations have gone
out and that he is expecting all
distriet TKA schools to compete in
the tourney. Boardman called the
coming event “the biggest forensic

minion, Richmond, VPI, Emory and
Henry, Virginia, Randolph-Macon,
Bridgewater, Roanoke, Hampton-
Sydney, and Lynchburg. The na- |

will be among the debaters present. |

Selection of W&L as the site of |

 

bitter floor fight between Richmond
and W&L at last year’s tournament.
Coupled with Boardman’s election
as president and Washington and
Lee’s winning the TKA champion-
ship, it represents a remarkable as-
cendanecy for the university in re-
gional forensic circles.

Boardman plans to exert leader-
ship to expand and improve the
quality of debating in this region.
He said the tournament is planned
with four rounds of debate and a
contest in extemporaneous speaking.

The debate team will open its
season a month before the TKA

‘Observer’

Washington and Lee and the Col-
lege Athletic Conference moved into |
the national spotlight Sunday with a
front page spread in the National |
Observer.

This non-subsidized conference,
consisting of W&L, Sewanee, South-
western, Centre, and Washington
University of St. Louis, was classed
as standing for “No pay, no pressure, |
no hypocrisy,” by the Observer.

It’s “proving that intercollegiate
sports can be amateur, successful,
and fun for all—players, fans, alumni
even faculty.”

The formation of the conference
was announced in January 1962.

“Conference rules state: ‘All par-
ticipation in sports by members of
its teams shall be solely beeause of
interest in and enjoyment of the
game. No financial aid shall be given
to any student which is conditioned
upon, or for the purpose of encour- |
aging, his participation in intercol- |
legiate athletics.”

No Purpose Seen

and Ring-tum Phi

Reverend King —
Writes For Aid

A form letter from Martin Luther
King requesting contributions to the
“crusade for freedom and dignity
for all Americans” which was re-
cently posted on the ODK bulletin
board, has drawn no response Bill
Lowry told the Ring-tum Phi yes-
terday.

The letter, addressed to “Dear
Friend of Freedom,” was supposedly
written from the City Jail of Albany,
Georgia, where King was jailed this
past August for demonstrations on
government property

King stated in the letter that the
“Albany Movement” was being sup-
ported by the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, of which he
is head, but that that organization
was running out of funds.

His letter read, in part, “The need
is urgent, your contribution is criti-
cal to the success of our efforts.
Your answer to this appeal will be
a great source of encouragement
to all of us here on this new battle-
front in the non-violent crusade for
freedom and dignity for all Ameri-
cans.”

According to the letter, some 1100

 

through August 3, involved the prac-
tical application of military tech- |
nology. At least six Distinguished |
Military Students awards were |
earned during the course of the|
camp; superior leadership is the |
requirement for the honor.

 

Of the 21 colleges and universi- |
ties represented at the camp, the|
W&L contingent scored a sixth place |
rating overall, placing the group in|
the upper third. Sam Bloch, W&L’s
new Battalion Commander, was
awarded the Best Cadet Award from
his company composed of 200 cadets. |

Three Staff Additions

The military department under-

_ went three staff changes to begin this
| school year. First Lieutenant D. A.

Branscome has been appointed to
replace Captain H. J. Hall, a profes-
sor here for three years, now de-
parted for duty in Vietnam. Lt.
Branscome will teach junior ROTC
students. Sergeant McSheffrey re-
placed Sergeant MecMillion, who left
for service in Germany.

The new commander of the De-
partment of Military Science, replac-
ing Major E. J. Roxbury, is Lieu-
tenant Colonel Jack P. Burch, pres-
ently a member of the Engineer
Corps stationed in Korea. Lt. Col.
Burch will leave Korea in October
to arrive here in November. He has
previously been a member of the
ROTC detachment at the University
of Oklahoma.

Negro citizens had been jailed for
“peacefully protesting”, and part of
the money would be for “providing
relief for the families of those who |
have been jailed” The money would
also be used for “meeting the ex-
penses of court trials,” and financing
a “mass Voter Registration Crusade.”

Board Selection

Is Announced

Selection of new members of the
Dance Board Advisory Committee
will be made during the next week,
chairman Ed Croft announced to-
day.

Now in its second year of exist-
ence, the Advisory Committee of 25
will be mainly limited to freshmen
sophomores this year. Its function
is as “ a means of relating the ac-
tions of the Dance Board to the
students.” In order to do this the
committee members recommend
bands and entertainers in popular
demand by the student body.

Croft, who heads the committee
in his capacity as vice president of
the Dance Board, emphasized that
his committee offers one of the few |
opportunities available to freshmen |
to take a hand in student affairs.

Croft asked for written applica-
tions from interested students, to}
be addressed to Ed Croft, Box 738. |

 

 

 

Fraternities Say No
To Delay In Rush

In Radical Change

By RANDY JONES

A majority of W&L’s 18 fraternity presidents voiced dis-
approval Monday of IFC president Ross Kyger’s plan for a
four weeks delay in rushing next year.

In informal roundtable discussion with house presidents

editors, Kyger with IFC official Tony

——————%k Schlesinger proposed a plan based

on three points:

1. For a period of four weeks
freshmen would have no fraternity
contacts.

2. During this period, the IFC
would sponsor two mixers and a
freshman party.

3. Rush would begin on the fourth
weekend.

Under the proposal, freshmen
would be eligible or ineligible for
rush, depending on S and U reports.
Also, every freshman would be
to see all 18 fraternities.

Presidents Oppose Plan

Most of the fraternity presidents
at the meeting voiced strong disap-
proval of Kyger’s plan. The main
objections raised were:

It would make for increased ani-
mosity between fraternities, and in-
crease the chances for so-called
“dirty rushing”

The four-week delay would be a
strain, both on fraternity men and
on freshmen, and bring about an in-
terruption in academics well into
the start of the semester.

Delayed rush would give fresh-
men the opportunity to form cliques
which would hamper fraternities
choosing a class, and result in forced
“package deals.”

The proposal, if carried out, would
increase the financial burden of the
fraternities.

Towards the end of the discussion,
the general consensus was that a
“radical change” like Kyger’s in the
rush system would serve no real
purpose.

Revise Present System

One of the participants suggested
that, instead of a completely reno-
vated rush program, a few revisions
in the old one would be more de-
sirable.

The only two revisions to the old
system mentioned were making it
possible for all freshmen to see all
18 houses and a mandatory 1.0 grade
point ratio for initiates, with fresh-

Lauds New Athletic Conference

“What's more, an honor system| comes a task and drudgery, it’s not; pus. He spends most of his years

govens the conference. Each mem-

| ber is expected to live up to its

commitments without any policing.

The Old Days

“This new athletic life is not due
to a lack of an athletic tradition. In
1950, Washington and Lee won eight,
lost two, and played in the Gator

| Bowl.”

Centre, Sewanee, and Southwest- |

ern all were powers in football's |
olden days
“Long ago, though, each of the

schools quit subsidizing athletes, and
knueckled down to the job of turn-
ing out students. Their decision—
and the new conference—are steps |
in American edueation’s drift toward
higher academic standards.

“Bob Payne, W&L tackle and sen-
ior co-captain from Louisville, Ky.,
comments: “They don’t drive us until
we're ready to drop dead. We all|
have a good time. When football be- |

football. Here we enjoy it.’

“On the typical campus, perhaps |
5 per cent of the male students take |
part in varsity athletics. At Wash-
ington and Lee, it’s 33 per cent—
350 of the all-male school’s 1,050
undergraduates. And under the pro-
gram of purity, no sport is more im-
portant than any other. So-called |
minor sports—soccer, lacrosse, golf, |
tennis—get all the money and equip- |
ment they need.

“Washington and Lee President
Fred Cole sees the CAC as giving
the collegiate athlete a ‘fair shake’ |
at last. This may sound peculiar in

 

 

| view of critics’ charges that college

athletes are recruited, coddled, and
ride an educational gravy train that
education can’t really afford.

“But Dr. Cole’s point is interest-
ing. To him, and to others in the|
CAC the pressures of big-time col- |
legiate athletics shunt the athlete

into an isolated corner of the cam- |

pursuing one thing: Athletics. Dr.
Cole reasons that if he’s brought
into the mainstream of campus life,
and forced to live and study as any
other student, his horizon will ex-
pand. New talents will be uncovered.

No Athletic De-emphasis
“CAC officials say they aren't
crusading for purity in college ath-
leties. Their policy fits them fine, At
the same time, Dr. Cole wryly says:
‘A great many schools could profit
from this.’

“He insists there’s no de-emphasis
on athletics at all. To the contrary,
the program aims at making athletics
open to all. In Washington and Lee’s
case, it's worked. Dr, Cole used the

| word de-emphasis in this sense: ‘If

a kid is the best football player in
the world but doesn’t have the
grades, he’s de-emphasized out of
school’.”

The Mississippi Crusades

A distinguished Negro author, James Baldwin, has pointed
out that “crusades have a way of becoming bloodthirsty.” In
Mississippi, at least three crusades have done just that. James
Meredith has succeeded in mustering all the available forces
of world opinion to aid in his fight to gain entrance to the Uni-
versity of Mississippi. Governor Ross Barnett and his followers,
on the other hand, have used all the means at their disposal
to block Meredith’s entrance, defying the law of the land, and,
at latest report, entertaining notions of secession. And Presi-
dent Kennedy has sent four thousand troops to preserve the
peace at Oxford, or nearly one combat-equipped soldier for
every student at the University.

Remarkably, each of these crusades has been a success.
Mr. Meredith has succeeded in enrolling at Ole Miss. Gov.
Barnett, a la Oval Faubus, is assured of re-election ad infin-
itum. And President Kennedy has acted with unusual “vigor,”
upholding the law, and, incidentally, garnering the U.S. Negro
vote.

But their success was not achieved without loss of life. At
the time of the writing of this editorial, at least two men, one
a foreign correspondent, had been killed, and several others
were critically injured. We may be sure that these episodes,
and those that are sure to follow, will be sensationalized in
every newspaper in the world.

And it was all predictable. Mississippi, after all, was the
home state of Emmet Till and Mack Parker. Crusades are par-
ticularly bloodthirsty in Mississippi.

Just who is at fault? The conduct of Mississippi students
and citizens can in no way be excused, but neither can the
conduct of James Meredith and the Federal Government.
Violence breeds violence, and by irresponsibly forcing inte-
gration on the University of Mississippi, Meredith and the
government have fanned the prejudices of the racial fanatics,
hindered rather than helped the cause of integration, and
lowered America in the estimation of the rest of the world.

Congratulations

The Dance Board’s overwhelmingly successful dance plan
subscription sales this year shouldn’t really come as a surprise to
anyone. The board has worked hard to give W&L the kind of
entertainment that will please the often picayunish student
body. Bringing such people as Clyde McPhatter, The Shirelles,
and the Coasters here for Openings indicates the Dance Board
has been putting forth some real effort.

Purchase by 92 per cent of the student body of dance
plans is a far cry from the situation two years ago when no-
body but freshmen could be talked into buying the yearly sub-
scriptions.

Last year’s group did a commendable job. They gave us
four top-notch weekends, and brought W&L Dance Sets into
the realm of respectability again.

Now, with a rousing beginning already under their belts,
this year’s board should show some tremendous advances. They
have all kinds of ideas—training of younger members to take
top positions, the Dance Board Advisory Committee to assist
in planning weekends, and what Frank Young called ‘‘variety”
in this year’s dance sets.

We are behind the dance board 100 per cent and trust they
will continue in the precedent of hard work they’ve begun.

Dr. Jenks: A Year

By BILL ATWELL

The opportunity to do research
is one of the most valuable posses-
sions of an historian. It enables him
to concentrate on particular fields of
interest for which he might other-
wise not have time.

Dr. William Alexander Jenks of
the Washington and Lee Department
of History had such an opportunity
in the past year.

From September, 1961 until the end
of June 1962, Dr. Jenks was in
Vienna working under a Faculty
Fellowship awarded by the Social
Science Research Council. This fel-
lowship was supplemented by a Ful-
bright Travel Grant to Austria.

Taaffe Ministry

While in Vienna, Dr. Jenks com-
pleted research on a project he be-
gan in 1954 concerned with Taaffe
Ministry in Austria from 1879-1893.
Most of Dr. Jenks’ work was done
in the State Archives of Austria and
the Parliamentary Library.

In addition to the research he con-
ducted, Dr. Jenks also gave seven
lectures as part of the United States

 

Information Agency’s Program in
Austria. Of particular interest is the
fact that he delivered one of the
lectures in German.

 

Dr. Jenks

Despite all this activity, Dr. Jenks
still managed to find time to be
a member of the Fulbright Selec-
tion Committee for Austrian Appli-

in Historic Vienna

cants for 1961-1962. This committee | Vienna and it was well worth a few

is an important cog in the exchange |

program of the country.
Second Visit

This stay was not Dr. Jenks first
visit to Vienna. In 1955 he spent a
half year there with his family and
was there again in the summer of
1959.

Dr. Jenks’ family was in Vienna
with him the past year, and accord-
ing to Dr. Jenks, they enjoyed them-
selves a great deal. The children
attended the American School of
Vienna during the year. They also
had the special treat of going to ski
school in February.

Dr. Jenks said that one of the big-
gest problems Americans have in
Vienna is the inability to buy goods
in a small area. For example, to buy
goods for a meal you have to go
to six or eight shops instead of one
or two. In the cold Vienna winters
this problem becomes increasingly
acute,

Center of Achievement

Discussing the disadvantages Dr.
Jenks said he enjoyed his stay in

 

inconviences. Being in a center of
historical achievement was import-
ant in that it gave him an opportun-
ity to catch up with what the Aus-
trian historians had been doing in
recent years. In addition he was able
to read the dissertations that have
been coming out of the University
of Vienna, which, because they
might never be published, would not
be available to him in this country.

On the way back to the United
States, the Jenks family traveled
through the Rhineland and Belgium
before going on to England. Dr.
Jenks said Amsterdam and London
were particularly interesting. This
was Dr. Jenks first trip to England
and he said he was most impressed
by the warmth of the people. It was
much greater than he expected.

A voyage from Southampton to
New York on the S.S. United States
ended this particular European trip
for Dr. Jenks and his family. Talk-
ing to him, however, you get the
impression this won't be the last
trip—not by a long shot.

 

W & L Alumnus Seeks
Congressional Position

By TRACY HARRINGTON

The tradition of Washington and
Lee as a “prep school for politicians”
is being carried on right here in
Rockbridge County.

John Otho “Jack” Marsh, Jr., a
1951 alumnus of W&L law school,
is Democratic candidate for Con-
gress from the 7th District of Vir-
ginia.

This district includes Rockbridge
County and generally all the Shen-
andoah Valley, up to Frederick and
Clarke counties, the home ground
of Senator Byrd.

Marsh seeks to succeed Burr Har-
rison of Harrisonburg, who is not
seeking re-election. Opposing the
W&L alumnus is Kenneth Robin-
son, an orchardist and alumnus of
VPI.

Marsh has received the endorse-
ment of Senator Byrd.

Running against four other office-
seekers, Marsh won the Democratic
primary in July, drawing more votes
than the combined total of his two
closest competitors. Almost half of
the total vote was cast for him, in
what was a light vote.

Robinson was nominated by the
Republicans in convention.

While he was at Washington and
Lee, Marsh was a member of Phi
Psi social fraternity, was Fancy
Dress vice president, a member of
the Cotillion Club, a cross-country
runner, business manager of the
Dance Board, and a Freshman Camp
counselor.

He attended law school on the
combination plan, getting his LL.B.
degree in five years. Prior to his
graduation, he married and his wife
taught in area public schools.

 

For a short time after his gradu-
ation, he was in the real estate
business here in Lexington. But he
and his wife moved to Strasburg,
Va., shortly thereafter. Marsh now
has a successful law practice estab-
lished in Strasburg.

As do many aspiring politicians,
Marsh became a joiner. Two of the
most important organizations in
which he is active are the National
Guard and Junior Chamber of Com-
merce. Both these connections
helped build up the organization
which brought Marsh victory in the
primary campaign.

While his campaign thus far has
been an energetic and active one, he
has been obvious in avoiding open
debate with Robinson. He has dodged
all but two efforts to get him in
face-to-face public meetings with
Robinson; in particular, he declined
an invitation from the Rockbridge
League of Women Voters to a pro-
posed candidates’ meeting in Lex-
ington,

Both Marsh and Robinson are
strongly conservative in the ap-
proaches they are taking before the
voters. These positions, of course, are
consistent with the deep, grass-roots
conservatism of the people of the
Shenandoah Valley.

With a scarcity of real issues be-
tween them, Robinson is trying to
persuade people of conservative per-
suasion to vote for the Republican
Party; Marsh emphasizes the con-
servative nature of the Democratic
Party in Virginia.

Operating Marsh’s local campaign
is another W&L alumnus and
schoolmate, Bill Romans, Lexington

Literary Magazine Appears

Replacing the discontinued
“Probes” magazine for student lit-
erary endeavors will be a publica-
tion this year called “Ariel.”

John F. Refo will edit the maga-
zine, scheduled to come out with its
first of three issues Oct. 30.

Student manuscripts will be ac-
cepted for consideration in any of
several areas: critical essays, poetry
and prose fiction, and crama.

Refo, along with other staff mem-
bers, will solicit for subscriptions
the latter part of this week in the
dorms and fraternity houses.

Refo said the price of subscription
to the three issues will be approx-
imately 75 cents.

In addition to W&L students, Hol-
lins and University of Virginia stu-
dents will be contributing to the
first issue of “Ariel.”

Any student interested in submit-
ting a manuscript for consideration
should contact John F. Refo at the
Sigma Chi house.

A PROFESSOR SPEAKS OUT

 

Topic Of Debate: Should Free World Economies Unite?

(Editor’s note: The National Debate
Topic of 1962-63 is, Resolved: that |
non-Communist nations of the world |
should establish an economic com-
munity. Washington and Lee, which
last year had more than 40 differ- |
ent men represent the University in |
intercollegiate debates, approaches |
the new season with many promising |
newcomers to join such eutstands |
ing debaters as Bill Boardman, Al |
Eckes, Bill Noell, and Ed Norton, |
who return to do further battle. |
Professor William W. Chaffin will |
direct the debaters again. The sea-|
son will be underway with a tele-|
vised debate in Norfolk, only two |
weeks hence.

Last Thursday Mr. John Gunn, of |
the Economics Department discussed
the topic with fifty-odd men who}
have indicated interest in debating |
for W&L this year. That discus- |
sion will continue at 4:30 on
Wednesday in Newcomb 8. Here he |
summarizes for the Ring-tum Phi)

 

the points he made at the first of
these meetings.)

Eo * *

The current college debate topic
is the best one colleges have de-

 

Mr. Gunn

 

bated for many years. It is a tech-,
nically good debate topic because aj
wide variety of arguments and
are both possible and _ reasonable, |
because there will be a premium on}
knowledge and preparation, and be- |
cause it affords large opportunity |
for exercise of the skills of argu-
mentation and persuasion. It is a|

 

refreshing topic, on the real front-|
ier of public policy and not in the
clean-up detail, as so many debate
topics have been. Most of all, it is
an important subject that is intel-|
lectually exciting.

‘To Strengthen the Free World

The heart of this debate is an at-
tempt to find means to increase the |
unity of the Free World and to|
strengthen it otherwise by improv-
ing its efficiency of production. The
problem, of course, is to increase
unity and improve efficiency through
means that will not restrict signifi-
cantly the soverignty, or indepen-
dence of action, of the individual |

| confluence

nations. The debate will be primarily
a contest of alternative means; few
would wish to challenge the objec-
tive suggested here.

Union: An Historical Trend

The particular suggestion of an
economic community of the non-
communist nations arises from the
of several
trends of long standing, urgently
brought into still sharper focus by
the continued pressure of the Sino-
Soviet threat to the Free World.

historical |

 

On the one hand, there has been)
a tendency throughout modern his- |
tory for consolidation of smaller
political entities into larger ones.
Sometimes such consolidations have
begun in the form of unions for
limited purposes, from which de-
veloped such commonality of inter-

 

ests as to make tighter unification
both painless and all but inevitable. |
(Specialists call this a “functional |
approach to integration.”) Such a

limited union was the tariff union of
Germanic states undertaken in 1834,
the Zollverein. Such a union appar-
ently is the European Community,
established in 1958 under the terms
of the Treaty of Rome.

International Groups

Running concurrently with this
trend since sometime in the nine-
teenth century has been develop-
ment and proliferation of interna-
tional organizations.
War II this trend has been modi-
fied especially in the direction of
regionalism, as evidenced by the
developments in the European Com-
munity, the Arab League, Latin
American groupings, and others.

International commercial policy
developed in the nineteenth Century
toward greater freedom in interna-

Since World)

tional trade and payments, with the |

United States running generally
counter to the trend. The First
World War, the inter-war period,

 

the World War II, represented a time
of set-back to the trend toward
freer trade, with the United States
again counter to the trend from
1934, when the Reciprocal Trade
Agreements Program was undertak-
en. With the recovery of European
production in the 1950's, however,
Europe began to lead the way once
more toward more liberal commer-
cial policy. The United States was
dragging its feet, until the present
Congress took action which, within
the next week or two, should give
this country a Trade Bill under
which it can take its place among
the leadership in world economic
policies .

Now, under the pressure of the
East-West Conflict, and with the
European Community as an imme-
diate model, the colleges will de-
bate this topic. It is a topic of real
importance for the Free World. It
should provide exciting material
for collegiate debate.

Washington and Lee’s sophomore

These “inexperienced” backs have

Skip Chase has picked up 52 yards

in two tries, Dan Manson, 19 yards
in 5 runs, and Julius Winfield, eight
yards in four attempts.

Bill David seems to be the “prize”
among the sophs, gaining 20 yards
rushing in seven tries and catching
five passes for 74 yards. David's
aerial talents have netted more
yardage than any W&L receiver
managed in nine games in 1961. Not

Generals’

Defense

Keys 28-6 Victory
Over Dutchmen

Saturday was supposed to be that long-delayed day of reck-

oning for Washington and Lee’

s football win streak.

The reckoner was to be Lebanon Valley College of Penn:
sylvania, coached by former W&L star center Bill McHenry.

That long-delayed day of reckon-*——————

ing, however, had to crawl back into
its secluded cellar to wait for an-
other day as the Generals rolled to}
a shocking 28-6 victory over the in- |
vaders from Pennsylvania.

How did the Generals whip this
Lebanon Valley team which most
informed sources favored by six to
eight points?

Superior Line Play

Superior line play by all three
W&L units is the best explanation
of the triumph which extended the
Generals’ win string to 15 games and
their streak of games without a loss
to 21.

Time and time again W&L’s line,

Bob Payne, guard Mickey Walker,
center Mike Sheffey, and end John
Madison, ran over the Dutchmen’s
heavier line to stop the ball carrier
in the backfield or throw the LV
passer for a long loss.

Only slippery running by Leban-
on Valley quarterback Wes MacMil-
lian kept the Dutchmen’s rushing
total out of the minus column.

MacMillian wiggled his way out of
many tight situations, including one

 

where five W&L tacklers appeared
to have him thrown for a 20-yard
loss. MacMillian, however, emerged
from the encircling Generals and
raced for a 16-yard gain.
Offensively W&L’s line contribut-
ed just as much as it did defensively
It opened gaping holes for the
Generals’ backs, gave quarterback
Chuck Lane good protection for his
passing, and blocked superbly.

Norman Dashes

Fumbles set up for four of the
game’s five touchdowns.
The Generals’ 57-yard fourth

quarter drive resulted in the only
legitimate tally when the Red unit
halfback John Norman raced the
final three yards with 12:09 left in
the game.

Alumni And Parents’ Weekends
Expected To Break Records

By JULIAN MARKHAM

The University sponsored Alum-
ni and Parents Weekends, of Oc-
tober 19-20 and October
respectively, are being met with un-
precedented interest. Intensive plan-
ning now under way should insure
the success of these annual events
for campus visitors.

This year’s Homecoming and Op-
enings Dance weekend will be com-
bined with an alumni gathering of
“considerable extent,” Mr. Wash-
burn, Alumni Director, announced
today.

450 Reservations

Mr. Washburn said that he had
450 requests for reservations to
date—making this year’s fall Alum-

ni weekend the largest in recent
years. Citing this unusually good

representation, Mr. Washburn stat-

| ed that his office was making every
| effort to insure a “most enjoyable”
Dorian Quintet is a newly}

weekend for the alumni.

The program of events for the
Alumni includes: the annual Al-
umni Board of Trustees meeting
on Friday afternoon with Open-
ings Dance affording that even-
ing’s entertainment, The busy Sat-
urday schedule for the Alumni
will be highlighted by tours of
the new science facilities, a Cof-
fee Hour at the home of President

ni luncheon, and the gridiron

conclude the scheduled events for
the Weekend.

Capitalizing on the scheduling
of the Alumni Weekend with Home-
coming and Opening Dances, the
Alumni Office will offer prizes to
the four fraternities having the
best Homecoming decorations. The
decorations will be judged by an
impartial committee of alumni, fac-
ulty, and local residents. It is hoped
that the fraternity decorations will
greatly enhance the festive atmos-
phere of the weekend. Also in the
attempt to stimulate alumni inter-
est, the Homecoming Queen selec-
tion will vary somewhat from past
practices this year. Each fraterni-
ty’s Homecoming Queen candidate
will be presented in
Dance figure. The crowning of the
Queen is scheduled for half-time at
Saturday’s game.

A REPORT FROM OLE MISS

By JOE MURPHEY
Friday Correspondent

(Ed. Note—The following article
was written by Joe Murphey, who
graduated from W&L last year and
is now a graduate student in geol-
ogy at the University of Mississippi.
The text of this article was written
on Tuesday.)

No one knew just when, where,
or in what form the showdown
would come here. It was expected
soon, probably before the day was
over. Meredith was reported “on
the way” by several different means
of transportation. Actually no one
knew just how he was coming, but
only that he was “on the way.” The
day was Thursday, the 27th of Sep-
tember. A large crowd of students
had gathered along University Ave-
enue leading to the main entrance
(where Meredith was supposed to
be ushered onto the campus by
marshals.)

“

For a town potentially on the
brink of violence or bloodshed,
this tiny university community
(two movies, one drive-in) was
remarkably peaceful and at ease.
But fer a few roaring “hoddy-
toddies” occasionally, there was no
evidence of the tension that was
mounting. Everyone carried on as
if he was unaware of the serious-
ness of the problem.

Signs boosting homecoming queen
candidates sprouted all over the
campus, the same campus that has
produced two Miss Americas since
1959. Freshmen men sported shaved
heads and blue and red _ beanies.
They talked of nothing but Ole Miss’
football game with Kentucky sched-
uled for Saturday night. Students in
the corridors of Mississippi’s red

afternoon. |

Then any similarity to any other |
football weekend ended. What!
awaited the students was enough to |
shock them into utter disbelief for
two or three hours. The Lyceum |
building was completely surround- |
ed by deputy U.S. marshals. The |
suddenness and brashness of the|
move was a mistake. Many more
were to come.

The students could not under-|
stand what the marshals thought |
they were doing. They had encir-|
cled, in full riot gear, a completely |
empty building, protecting no one
(Meredith had been placed on cam-
pus by helicopter almost a quarter of
a mile from the Lyceum building.)
Supposedly, they were holding the

monies.

They should have picked a less
historic building, for this is the
oldest building on the campus and
has been the center of Ole Miss
activity since 1848 when it was
completed. It held sentimental
value for most of the students,
and they thought that the mere
presence of Federal men on its
premises constituted a desecra-
tion unequalled since General
Grant rode his horse through its
halls nearly a century ago.

The students started out Sunday
afternoon by shouting slogans of
their pride in Mississippi and ended
up with very little to be proud of.
The restraint and simple boisterous-
ness that had marked most of the
demonstrations in the Meredith sit-
uation degenerated into unrestrain-
ed hatred and violence. Before the
rioting ended, scores were injured,

some very critically, and at least
two men were dead. Police said that
Paul Guihard, a French reporter,
had a puncture wound in his back.
The “puncture” later proved to be
from a .38 caliber bullet. The sec-
ond fatality was a 23-year old stu-
dent, a native of Oxford, who was

brick buildings shrugged off ques-
tions about Meredith’s possible re-
entry (he had already been turned
away from Ole Miss three times.)
They thought of the possibility of
another attempt; but since over 200
Mississippi Highway Patrol cars
were on campus, they didn’t worry

 

killed by a shotgun blast in the
back of his head.

The whole affair had started out
like a circus sideshow, with about
175 Federal marshals the center of
attraction. The crowds of curious
onlookers displayed signs saying
“Yankee Go Home” and Confederate
flags. As the white-helmeted marsh-
als armed with tear gas guns ringed
the Lyceum, the crowd began to
jeer. Cries of “Why don’t you go to
Cuba?” “Nigger lovers,’ and “goon
squad” gang out. Then the taunt-
ing began with intensive force. Stu-
dents also shouted “Why aren’t you
integrated? I don’t see any nigger
marshals.” The crowd began to sing
“Micky Mouse” to their tormen-
tors.

about it.

When it was learned that Mere-
dith had turned back, everyone
cheered the fourth victory of the
highway patrol and returned to
their fraternities, sororities, dorms,
etc. Everyone seemed to think the
battle had been recessed for the dur-
ation of the weekend and expected
it to resume on Monday. At any rate,
Ole Miss traditionally begins its vic-
tory celebrations on Thursday night,
and no one seemed to think this
weekend was any different from the
rest.

In many ways it was not differ-
ent. Ole Miss trounced its oppon-
ent on the gridiron, the victory
party was held in the Heidle-
burg Hotel in Jackson, and the

Change For The Sake Of Change?

The past few weeks have seen new efforts to revise our
present rush system. The IFC was presented with a plan that
would delay rush until after S&U reports. This is the same
plan that was presented to and defeated by the IFC last year.

It is our feeling that there are some who wish a change—

 

Then came the second mistake.

 

 

any change—just for the sake of change. True, our present
system has its faults. However, the advantages of our system by
far outweigh the disadvantages.

There are those who contend that the freshmen meet
the fraternities before they are introduced to the University.
This is not wholly true. Freshman Camp has long served as
a means of introducing freshmen to the University. Futher-
more, our freshmen should be mature enough to make their
own decisions regarding fraternities and the University. After
all, this is not a prep school, where all your thinking is done
for you.

True, a freshman lives like a king for five days before he
opens his first book. However, with this behind him, he can
settle down to work. Nothing is disrupted and the freshman
has the opportunity to meet his university in a more relaxed
atmosphere.

If we were to adopt a delayed rush system, many of the
present problems would be compounded. The freshmen as well
as upperclassmen would have a whole month in which to antici-
pate rush. This could be very distracting. In addition, classes
would be disrupted at a time when things have just settled
down. This would cause far more problems than in the early
days of the semester when nothing of real consequence is hap-
pening.

It is our hope that our present rush system will be main-
tained and improved. The IFC should exhaust all possibilities
of improving our present system before seeking a new pro-

 

gram. A change is not always the best solution toa problem.

One of the drivers of a truck full
of relief marshals was a Negro.
The mood of the crowd instantly
grew ugly. It was about 7:00 p.m.
and most of the students had fin-
ished dinner and were congregat-
ing around the Lyceum again. |
Some had brought rolls and cus-
tard and cream pies to “feed the
hungry marshals.” More and more
derisive remarks were shouted
and then lighted cigarettes were
thrown at the driver and then at
the marshals.

A Movietone photographer who)
took pictures of the crowd was|
mobbed as he got back into his ie |
As he and a woman reporter sat in-|
side, both students and outsiders
smashed the windows and bashed in

|
the top of the car. They also at-|
tempted to turn the vehicle over. |
The reporter’s camera was snatched |
and dashed to the street. The oc-|
cupants were assisted from the car |
by highway patrolmen and _ taken
away in a squad car. The crowd
then continued their destruction of |
the car.

 

After this the mob got increasing- |
ly out of hand. The violence was |
mostly away from the marshals|
since a protective ring of highway
patrolmen were around them. The
crowd would listen to the state po-
lice and would back away from the
marshals when the state troopers
asked them to to so.

The vastly outnumbered cam-
pus police tried to instill a lit-
tle order but were largely unsuc-
cessful. As vandalism toward the
government trucks broke out,
state patrolmen were overheard
saying. “There’s nothing we can
do; we don’t have any authority

 

anymore.” Earlier in the day Gov.
Ross Barnett had announced that
the Federal government had fed-
eralized the campus and_ that
whatever happened was their re-
sponsibility.

Then the wrath of the mob fo-
cused on the trucks which the mar-
shals had arrived in earlier and|
which remained parked in front of |
the Lyceum building. More cigaret- |

|
|
|
|
|

| tes were thrown and the canvas top |
}on one of the trucks caught fire |
| Rocks were thrown at the trucks, |

breaking some of the windows. The
signs saying “Help Ross Keep Mis- |
sissippi Sovereign” which had been |
placed in all students rooms a day |
or so earlier by some mysterious |
donor began to be plastered all over |
the trucks. One homemade sign read |
“Join the Army and See the Old!
Miss Campus” Suddenly the mar-|
shals fired point-blank into the
crowd. Four of the Mississippi high-
way patrolmen were hit in the back
by the huge cannisters of tear gas.
Two more were hit in the face. The
crowd dispersed.

The marshals soon decided to
clear out the whole area at once.
They then charged, firing the can-
nisters of tear gas straight at crowds
gathered as little as one hundred
yards away. Many of these crowds
were coeds, merely curious and not
participating in the demonstrations
or riots. One of the tear gas bombs

groups and hit a girl squarely in
the chest, just inches below her col-
larbone.

Four male students near her at-
tempted to rescue her when she
was knocked to the ground by the
bomb. They were carrying her

 

out of the fumes when two mar-
shals came up with billy clubs
and began to shout at and _ hit
them. They told them to leave
the girl, that they would take care
of her. The boys complied and one
of the marshals picked her up and
carried her straight back into the
heavy fumes of gas and smoke.
The fifty or so students standing
by heard and saw all of this. This,
more than anything else, incen-
sed the crowd. Everyone was now
at a fever pitch.

The marshals realizing what they
had started, called for reinforce-
ments. One moving van full of tear
gas arrived. It was bombarded by
bricks to such an extent that the
driver could hardly see through the
shattered windshield. Any vehicle
with an out-of-state license plate
or without an Ole Miss sticker was
as good as wrecked. Highway pa-
trolmen had to escort the ambu-
lances and doctors through the
crowd. This was about the only
function left which the troopers
could perform.

The injured girl and the highway |

patrolman that had been struck by
the tear gas projectiles were car-
ried away safely. The girl and two
of the patrolmen are still hospital-
ized,

“Hello sir? Well, I’m mentaly ill

conversation droned on as I tried to}
size this man up.

The call was from the Chairman |
of the Arts Department at Prince- |
ton, checking up on our new faculty |
member’s recent research in Rome. |

My Work or La Dolce Vita
After hanging up, Mr. Shirey |
turned to me with his ingratiating
grin. “So you want to do an article
about me? Should I be confidential
or not?”
“Well, sir, suppose we start with
your trip to Rome.”
“You mean my
la dolce vita?”
Immediately I could see my inter-
view taking on bright prospects. |
Working on his Ph.D. for |
Princeton, Mr. Shirey has been |
studying at the French Academy |

work there or |

in Rome. Supported by a Ful-
bright Scholarship and Italian
Government Grants, he has done |
research on the 18th Century Ital-
ian artist, Hubert Robert.

“My work has included a study
of Robert’s contemporaries and the
influence which they had in the de-
velopment of the great painter’s
style,’ Mr. Shirey explained.

In addition to his Ph.D. work Mr.
Shirey found time to play minor
roles in several Italian mov-
ies. Also on his list of varied activi-
ties, he taught art to small, private
groups in Rome and lectured for two

 

weeks to American students in Lux-
embourg.

National Spelling Bee Champion
Mr. Shirey’s colorful scholastic
career has left a continuous record |
of exceptional ability. As a youth,
he won the championship for the
National Spelling Bee contest. He
was also winner of an English con-
test in his home state, Ohio.

As an undergraduate at Princeton
(Class of ’58), Mr. Shirey was both
a pre-med and an art history ma-
jor. “My primary interest was in
becoming a doctor,” he recalls, “but
Princeton believed in the ‘humanis-
tic’ type of eduction and made me
take a liberal major also.”

He become more and more in-
terested in his art courses and less
so in medicine. One evidence of
promise in his new field was his
discovery that art critics had at-
tributed a painting to the wrong
artist. A large museum in New
York City contracted young Shir-
ey to lecture on the methods by

 

which he had discovered the true
artist,

Mr. Shirey spent two years of his

| undergraduate work at L’Ecole des

Beaux Arts He developed such a
fondness for la vie de France that
he made several return visits dur-
ing summers as a waiter for vari-
ous French hotels.

“I was anxious to learn the fine art
of French cooking,’ he continued.
“Still, I manage to spill food over
everybody and make a general mess
of it all.”

Mr. Shirey also spent several
summers in Greece as a “pleasure
tourist.” He further recalls some
hair-raising expeditions alone the
southern Mediterranean and_ the
Nile.

In his extensive travels, he has
picked up a fluent knowledge of
languages. “I speak French, Italian,
and Spanish,” he said, “and a little
English.”

all over town. The rioters even
broke the overhanging of the flag-

The mob broke into the chem-
istry-pharmacy building and stole
bottles of acid and threw them at
the marshals. What the marshals
had started by a few shots of tear
gas was not as easy to halt as they
imagined. They resorted to brutal-
ity.

One 19-year od boy was caught
by two marshals who beat him to
the ground with their sticks, stood
on his shoulders, then dropped a
tear gas grenade on his head and
held him there until he passed out
from the fumes.

A bulldozer was cranked
the students, the blade was raised
to shield the driver, and then it
was used to plow through a half
dozen cars which were parked in
such a way that they shielded the
marshals.

Ex-Maj. Gen. Edwin Walker

tle Rock, led some student at-
tacks on the Lyceum building

to persuade them to stop. The
students booed him when he
changed his stand.

pair of dark glasses, which he man-

are a gift to me and the only pair I

In commenting on his teaching
policy, Mr. Shirey explained that he
had no intention of giving any “gut”

ded, “I see no sense in swamping
students with complex theories and
symbolisms. What I am aiming at is

The Washington and Lee soccer
team dropped a 3-0 decision to the
Fort Lee Travelers here Wednesday.

Fort Lee is a U.S. Army team
whose players spoke little English
but played an aggressive game of
soccer.

The visitors broke into the scoring
column midway through the first
period as Jim O’Neill, the center
forward, booted a cross from the
right wing into the net.

Washington and Lee’s hustling ball
club, led by Co-Captains Clements
and Pagano, held off the opposition
and controlled the ball fairly well
until the middle of the fourth period
when the Generals’ defense began
to lag.

The Travelers’ fourth period
scores came within three minutes
of each other. Their second tally
of the day was rung up by right
wing Mario Pusaterio and _ their
third score was executed by Gus
Siapkaris.

The Generals will try to raise

' their total to 22 undefeated games
' when they meet Emory and Henry

College in Emory, Virginia, tomor-

' row afternoon.

As was the case last year, it

| seems that this will be their most
, challenging game of the season.

The Wasps have many of last

| year’s starters back this season.
' Their line is big and rugged, and

is backed up by a swift, aggressive

“a backfield.

Right halfback and
sophomore Bob Magill, of the
Wasps, is very fast and will be
difficult to stop.

Bob Hawkins, the other starting
halfback, can run and pass and
therefore will be a constant threat
to the General defense.

Rounding out Emory and Henry’s
backfield is Ron Burton, a heavy
fullback with good speed.

Coach McLaughlin’s Generals are
quite aware of what they will be
up against and have been working
all week.

Yoffe May Be Out Again

There is a_ possibility that Stu
Yoffe, the Generals’ starting half-
back, will not play because of an
injury incurred during practice last
week.

Lineman Jim Sylvester, who was
hurt early in pre-season practice,
has regained his pre-injury form
and will return to the lineup Sat-
urday.

It is hoped that the passing com-
bination of quarterback Chuck

ANOTHER YEAR, ANOTHER DOLLAR

With today’s entry I begin my ninth year of writing columns
in your school newspaper for the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes.

Nine years, I believe you will agree, is a long time. In fact,
it took only a little longer than nine years to dig the Suez
Canal, and you know what a gigantic undertaking that was!
To be sure, the work would have gone more rapidly had the
shovel been invented at that time, but, as we all know, the
shovel was not invented until 1946 by Walter R. Shovel of
Cleveland, Ohio. Before Mr. Shovel’s discovery in 1946, all
digging was done with sugar tongs—a method unquestionably
dainty but hardly what one would call rapid. There were, natu-
rally, many efforts made to speed up digging before Mr. Shovel’s
breakthrough—notably an attempt in 1912 by the immortal
Thomas Alva Edison to dig with the phonograph, but the only
thing that happened was that he got his horn full of sand. This
so depressed Mr. Edison that he fell into a fit of melancholy
from which he did not emerge until two years later when his
friend William Wordsworth, the eminent nature poet, cheered
him up by imitating a duck for four and a half hours.

But I digress. For nine years, I say, I have been writing this
column for the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes, and for nine
years they have been paying me money. You are shocked. You
think that anyone who has tasted Marlboro’s unparalleled
flavor, who has enjoyed Marlboro’s filter, who has revelled in
Marlboro’s jolly red and white pack or box should be more than
willing to write about Marlboro without a penny’s compensa-
tion. You are wrong.

Compensation is the very foundation stone of the American
Way of Life. Whether you love your work or hate it, our system
absolutely requires that you be paid for it. For example, I
have a friend named Rex Glebe, a veterinarian by profession,
who simply adores to worm dogs. I mean you can call him up
and say, ‘Hey, Rex, let’s go bowl a few lines,” or “Hey, Rex,
let’s go flatten some pennies on the railroad tracks,’ and he
will always reply, “No, thanks. I better stay here in case

somebody wants a dog wormed.” I mean there is not one thing
in the whole world you can name that Rex likes better than
worming a dog. But even so, Rex always sends a bill for worm-
ing your dog because in his wisdom he knows that to do other-
wise would be to rend, possibly irreparably, the fabric of
democracy.

 

It’s the same with me and Marlboro Cigarettes. I think
Marlboro’s flavor represents the pinnacle of the tobacconist’s
art. I think Marlboro’s filter represents the pinnacle of the
filter-maker’s art. I think Marlboro’s pack and box represent
the pinnacle of the packager’s art. I think Marlboro is a pleas-
ure and a treasure, and I fairly burst with pride that I have
been chosen to speak for Marlboro on your campus. All the
same, I want my money every week. And the makers of
Marlboro understand this full well. They don’t like it, but they
understand it.

In the columns which follow this opening installment, T will
turn the hot white light of truth on the pressing problems of
campus life—the many and varied dilemmas which beset the
undergraduate—burning questions like “Should Chaucer class-
rooms be converted to parking garages?” and “Should proctors
be given a saliva test?” and “Should foreign exchange students
be held for ransom?”

And in these columns, while grappling with the crises that
vex campus America, I will make occasional brief mention of
Marlboro Cigarettes. If I do not, the makers will not give me
any money. © 1962 Max Shuiman

The makers o: Marlboro will bring you this uncensored,
free-style column 26 times throughout the school year. Dur-
ing this period it is not unlikely that Old Max will step on
some toes—principally ours—but we think it’s allin fun and
we hope you will too.

A student walking from one side
of the campus to the other would
be frisked and asked for his iden-
tification a half a dozetn times. It
was impossible to leave the cam-
pus without passing through four
roadblocks. Coming into the cam-
pus and leaving it a car would be
searched thoroughly at least three
times.

When the 101st Airborne extended
their frisking privileges to the co-
eds, more than two-thirds of them
promptly left the campus. There is
now only about 40 per cent of the
student body left on the campus.

Marshal law has been in effect for
two days. It is expected to continue

 

for thirty more. The marshals are |

dith can be comforted by the fact
that paper plates and plastic knives

 

  

and forks are being used in the
cafeteria on the campus.

Wheeler Novel, ‘Fail-Safe,’
‘Should Burst On Public’

By SHANNON JUNG

Dr. J. Harvey Wheeler of the
W&L political science department
has collaborated with Eugent Bur-
dick, co-author of The Ugly Amer-
ican, to produce a Book-of-the-
Month Club selection. The book, en-
titled Fail-Safe, was called by the
Editorial Board of the Club, “an
instant unanimous choice.”

The Board describes the book as
“a novel that should burst upon
the reading public like a bomb.”
Americans’ unbridled worship of
the machine and contempt for the
intellect form the central theme of
this work.

Clifton Fadiman, a member of the
Editorial Board, says in reviewing
the book, “Experience teaches re-
viewers to shun superlatives, es-
pecially cliche superlatives. But, be-
cause I know no simpler, no better
way to put the matter, I am driven
to one: Fail-Safe is the most excit-
ing novel I have read in at least
ten years.”

Dr. Wheeler, Professor of Political
Science at Washington and Lee for
five years, has been a member of
the faculty since 1954. Earning his
B.A. and M.A. at Indiana Univer-
sity, Wheeler continued his studies
at Harvard, where he received his
doctorate.

Wheeler on Leave

Wheeler has been on leave of
absence from the Department of
Political Science to work on a pro-
ject for the Fund for the Republic
of the Ford Foundation. This pro-
ject is individual from the book.
He will return in September of ’63.

He has published many articles
in such magazines as The American
Quarterly, The Reporter, Ethics,
American Historical Review, West-
ern Political Quarterly, and the

 

Shenandoah. A brief narrative which |’ —

Wheeler
vided the central theme for
new publication.

Explaining its title, fail-safe is
said to be “a fixed point in the sky
where the planes will orbit until
they get a positive order to go in
and bomb. Fail-safe simply means
that if something fails, it is still safe.”

The indefinite time of the novel is
“the very near future, perhaps to-
morrow, perhaps five minutes away,”
explains the Book-of-the-Month
Club News. The co-authors have
east a danger signal to the human
race. The situation stacks up thus:
The watchers at the Big Board, con-
trolling the rehearsed maneuvers of
ever-vigilant, ever-mobile bombers,
note with horror that a blip at the
number 6 Activating Mechanism has
gone past the fail-safe point. As a
result, the Vindicators (insuperably
efficient bombers) are told by the
computers to bomb Russia. And
there the real story begins.

Book To Be Serialized

The lesson that Fail-Safe teaches
is the consequences of world con-
tempt for the human intellect: the
machine will take over completely.
The machine that has no interest in
anyone’s survival.

The book will be serialized in The |
Saturday Evening Post and there is
talk to the effect that Darryl Zan-

called Abraham ‘59 pro-

on the Wheeler-Burdick collabora-
tion.

Fadiman goes on to praise the
book saying, “Almost surely Messers. |
Burdick and Wheeler will be read
by hundred of thousands. ...In its)
long history, the Club has ‘offered
few, if any, books so sheerly excit-
ing as this one.

The Young Republican Club an-

candidate for the seventh district
Congressional seat.

Club president Rob Wheelock said
that the plans include door-to-door
canvassing, downtown window ad-
vertising, literature distribution,
bonfires, beer rallies, cider and pret-
zels.

Advertising space has already been
obtained in several downtown store
windows. Campaigning begins next
Monday with a two hour door-to-
door session in Lexington followed
by a free keg of beer for those
club members helping. Tuesday,
Oct. 16, the Lexington Republicans
will sponsor a rally at the high
school.

On November 3, a bonfire and
beer rally is planned. “New Fron-
| tier liberalism” will be burned in
effigy. Then, on Election day, a
| final get out the vote effort will be
made to increase the turnout at the

Executive Committee post.

PEP’s Pledge :
6 Non-Jewish
Sophomores

Phi Epsilon Pi, Washington and
Lee’s five-man Jewish fraternity,
pledged six Gentile non-fraternity
sophomores Sunday in an effort to
build membership to an operating
quota.

The Phi Eps, long in danger of
closing due to steadily waning num-
bers, were on the verge of fold-
ing a week ago.

President Dick Herman said the
fraternity had thought about open
rush, “but wasn’t sure non-Jewish
boys would be interested.”

A meeting a week ago with sever-
al NFU upperclassmen resulted in
Sunday’s move.

Herman said the Phi Eps hope to
pick up several freshmen and some
more upperclassmen in the next few
weeks,

Those who pledged were:

Kline Bolton, sophomore dean’s
lish student, Robert E. Lee scholar
and varsity wrestler.

Bill Surbaugh, sophomore mem-
ber of the debate team.

Bill Supon, member of the Glee
Club, UCA, and Ring-tum Phi.

Braxton Tabb, Bob Brooks, and
Eric Hanssen.

A nominal

pledging period of

| three weeks is scheduled to go into
| effect for the six immediately. At
| the end of that time, they will be

eligible for initiation.

The Phi Ep kitchen, which closed
last year, will be re-opened second
semester when most of the new
“pledges” will move into the house.

House membership for the Phi
Eps, with pledges, brothers, and so-
cial members, is now 13.

Living capacity of the house is
16, according to Herman.

“We have quite a few ideas for
innovations,” Herman said. “We are,
I suppose, a new kind of social fra-
ternity at Washington and Lee—the
first integrated one, anyway.”

Among the “new ideas” Herman
voiced were plans for shortening
freshmen pledge training period
from a whole semester, revision of
general rush procedures, and chang-

its candidate for the freshman

Nashville, Tennessee, was the

freshman camp this year. He
kplays on the line of the freshman
football team, and is now on the
W&L Debate Team.

Elected president of the Delt
pledge class, Miller was the student
body president of his high school
in Nashville as well as being class
president of his graduating class
each year throughout school.

Scholastic Honors

Besides being an avid participant
in athletics of all kinds, Miller is
highly qualified scholastically. He
was a National Merit Scholarship
Finalist, valedictorian of his senior
class in high school, and he received
class medals in English, American
and ancient history, chemistry, biol-
ogy, and mechanical drawing.

As captain of the football team
at his high school, Miller was named
to the All-City, All-Division, and
All-State football teams. His senior
year he was named the most popu-
lar student and the best all-around
student by his classmates.

Guild Comments

Known by his friends as possessing
natural leadership ability, Miller has
gotten to know a large portion of
the freshman class already. Steve
Guild, Independent Party chairman,
said last night after Miller’s nomi-
nation was confirmed that: “The In-
dependent Party chose Joe Miller
not only for his outstanding quali-
fications, but also for the definite
qualities of leadership which he has
shown. Miller, as the freshman
Executive Committeeman, will be
another step in the continuation of
responsible student government at
W&L..”

 

Cummings In Shenandoah

The fall issue of Shenandoah will
feature a new poem by the late
E. E. Cummings, editor James Boat-
wright has announced.

The poem was sent to Shenandoah
on July 22, Boatwright said. Cum-
mings died only a few weeks later,
closely following his great contem-
poraries Ernest Hemingway and
William Faulkner. Cummings had
been universally recognized as one
of America’s greatest men of let-
ters.

The poem will be followed by an
appreciation of Cummings by S. V.

W&L Campus Political Situation: How It Stands Now

By ROGER PAINE
Managing Editor
Tuesday Edition

With the nominations last night
of the two freshmen candidates for
the Executive Committee, politics
has once again come to the fore-
front on the W&L campus. Each fall
and spring, the various issues that
are fashioned by the two political
parties are batted around, and from
year to year, the elections result
vary slightly.

Last year at this time, the two
parties were unequally balanced, as
they are now. The University Party
consisted of all the Red Square
houses, plus the SAE’s, ZBT’s, the
KA’s, the DU’s and the Sigma Chis.

 

The Independent Party was made
up of the Phi Gams, Delts, Phi Psis,
Kappa Sigs, Pi Phi, Phi Ep, Lambda
Chi and SPE.
Vote Deficit

This put ten houses against eight
houses, at that time, and one of the
eight fraternities in the Independent |
Party, Phi Epsilon Pi, number ed |
only 12. Any candidate running for

election from the Independent Party

had to overcome a vote deficite of
considerably over one hundred bal-
lot.s

The freshman Executive Commit-

teeman election in the fall is based |
the |

on few elements to begin with:
average W&L freshman has by the
middle of October, not had time to

prove himself to his fellow students
to any significant degree. High
school or prep school qualifications
plus personal popularity figure high-
ly in the election; what influence
party politics have at this point is
hard to say.

New Pledging Proposals
The IFC last night discussed what we believe to be three
very significant proposals: 1) that fraternities have a uniform
1.0 initiation requirement, 2) that pledges who fall below a .4
at mid-semester will not be forced to take part in pledging

activities, and 3) that freshmen who do not make a .75 either
semester of their first year will not be allowed to live or take

meals at fraternity houses.

These proposals are designed to combat the notion of many
die-hard fraternity men that “‘it’s not for knowledge that we
come to college.’”’ Specifically, the IFC hopes to encourage
freshman scholarship by alleviating the pressures of pledging
on border-line students and, at the same time, applying eco-
nomic pressure on the fraternities themselves to promote bet-
ter grades. In addition, the proposals would tend to eliminate

some of the intellectual dead

forced to put up with and that drag down fraternity averages.

It is high time that fraternities realize that Washington and
Lee is changing and that, if the fraternity system is to remain an
integral part of the University, fraternities must adjust to the
changes. Those fraternities which insist on placing social
activities above scholarship might very well be partying them-

selves out of existence.

A Threat To The Party System

The announcement of the Freshman EC candidates brings
to mind one of the more pressing problems facing W&L’s
student body, that of the present campus political setup. As it
stands now, the Independent Party is on the losing end of an
eleven-seven fraternity split, with very little hope of reducing

the odds in the near future.

The party system here is the logical outgrowth of the fra-
ternity system. Each fraternity is understandably anxious to
promote its own members, and the best way to do so is to
co-operate with other fraternities by agreeing on candidates and
then pooling votes. This system, despite frequent criticism,
has been the basis for student government at Washington and
Lee, consistently supplying responsible student leadership. All
things considered, the party system is a decided asset, one
which we should try to preserve.

The present situation poses a threat to the system, for the
Independent Party has seriously considered taking the easy
way out and disbanding. But they have no one to blame for
their problems but themselves. This time last year, the Big
Three student body positions were held by Independents, as
were several other “‘prestige’’ positions. In addition, the In-
dependent Party enjoyed a virtual monopoly of the non-
fraternity vote. But inept leadership and lax party discipline
in last spring’s elections led to the SPE switch and loss of the
non-fraternity vote, resulting in the present unbalanced split.

The houses in the Independent Party are admittedly at a
disadvantage now, but we urge them not to throw up their
hands in defeat. A two-party system benefits the entire Uni-
versity, and it is the Independent Party’s obligation to do their

best to make it work.

Foreign Exchange Students Give
Candid Impressions Of America

By JIM DEJONG

We hear a lot—maybe even too
much—about student exchange pro-.
grams, U.S. college customs as op-|
posed to European practices, etc.
It’s hard to single out the truth!
from the propaganda, on both sides. |

But four W&L students this year
should know what the straight story
is. They are here on grants, ex-
change programs and as individuals |
from three European and a South)
American country.

In his second year at W&L,}
Alonso Mendoza comes from Sucre, |
Bolivia, a town of about 44,000 peo- |
ple. Raimondo Strassoldo joins the!
Generals from a small Italian vil-|
lage near Trieste. |

Hailing from Scandinavia are
Kris Krisoferson from Upsala,
Sweden, and Jan-Erik Berg of Os-
lo, Norway.

Mendoza, who is following a pre-|
scribed four-year course here, plans |
tentatively to major in either French
or philosophy, and noted the lan-
guage barrier as one of his chief
difficulties in adjusting to school.

Strassoldo, in the U.S. on a Ful-
bright scholarship, is studying ad-

IFC President Replies

To the Ring-tum Phi,

I regret that I find it necessary
to correct several things about the
article concerning delayed rush in
the paper Tuesday. The first mis-
take was in the headline—Fraterni-
ties Say No To Delay In Rush. It
was not the fraternities who de-
cided to drop it, but rather the
fraternity presidents and the News-
paper Editors who met not as rep-
resentatives of fraternities, but rath-
er as responsible members of the
Student Body. The purpose of the
meeting was to discuss the merits
and demerits of the plan freely and
as individuals. We specifically kept
a reporter out of the meeting in
order to promote freer discussion.

There was constant reference in
the article to “Kyger’s” plan. While
I would not mind credit for this
plan since I believe it to be a good
one, it simply is not true that this
is my plan. Parts of the original
plan were mine; however, the finish-
ed plan was the combined effort
of a group of seven people, with
significant contributions from George
Honts, Bob Doenges, Tony Schle-
singer, Roy Goodwin, and myself.

As for the “radical change” label,
I feel this plan is much less radical
than the other plans we were asked
to consider which include Sopho-
more rush, Second semester rush,
between semesters rush, extended
rush during the first half of the
semester and others. We rejected
these in favor of an original plan
more suited to W&L.

When newspaper reporters are not
permitted inside a meeting, it is
the newspaper’s duty to print the
story correctly as it is given to them.
Apparently the story was altered
after the reporter turned it in. May
I suggest that if the newspaper is
to be the responsible voice of the

vertising and journalism at W&lL. |
He seemed particularly impressed |
with what he called the “personal |
relationship between students and
teachers.”

Berg, too, is a Fulbright scholar
and wants to major in economics.
He shared Mendoza’s views on the
language barrier, adding quickly
that the problem was not in talking
to students “but in reading text-
books.”

Krisoferson’s one year stint at
W&L is being financed by a Scott
scholarship. He will return next
year to study in his native Sweden.

Dating—Here and There

The first—and probably liveliest
topic of discussion during the Ring-
tum Phi’s interview with the foreign
students was that of dating.

In Bolivia, according to Mendoza,
college campuses don’t have social
fraternities. Dating and parties usu-
ally are put on by various clubs
and school classes, with much less
organization in social groups than

 

is found in the U.S. fraternity sys-
tem.

One thing the Bolivian college stu-
dent does have in common with his
U.S. counterpart, though: beer, says
Mendoza, is the national drink of
the college set.

In Italy, Strassoldo said, young
people date “any night of the week,”
without the emphasis to Saturday
night dating he finds here.

Young Italy Dances
Young Italy may do it different
nights, but they do the same things.
Movies, dancing, and beaching are
all popular dating activities.

And, Strassoldo added, an Italian
boy doesn’t enter a girl’s home until
he is “quite serious about her.”

Berg said that Norwegian dating
customs were pretty much the same
as American, but commented that
transportation was a major problem
in his country.

Passing to the subject of compara-
tive standards of living, Mendoza

Lybass Reviews
Summer Stay
In Italian Town

By BILL ATWELL

What’s it like to spend a summer
in Italy?

To Junior Tom

Lybass, it was
great—except for a scarcity of water
fountains and too many oil-and-

vinegar salads.

Lybass, who last year represented
W&L on the General Electric Col-
lege Bowl, lived this summer with
an Italian family in Reggio, Ca-
labria, Italy.

He was participating in a _ pro-
gram called “Experiments in In-
ternational Living” which sends
American students to live in homes
of peoples throughout the world.

Lybass stayed with a family of
four, and seemed to be particularly
impressed by the cheerfulness and
the spirit of the family.

“Life in Italy is at a far easier
and more enjoyable pace than life
in the United States,” he said.

According to Lybass, the main re-
creation of the Italian populace is
either walking or swimming. “And
they like to talk,” he added.

Everybody who goes to Italy raves
about Italian food, and Lybass was
no exception. He did limit his com-
ments to a word about the always-
present salads, and a remark on the
main dish of the Italian meal.

“Spaghetti and other noodle con-
coctions served as the staple food
most of the time,” he said. Lybass
didn’t comment on Italian wines,
exotic dishes, or the famous culinary
paradises of Rome.

Lybass ran into only two major
difficulties: the language barrier and
the lack of public water fountains
when he was thirsty.

About the language barrier, he
said, “towards the end of the sum-
mer I had little trouble making my-
self understood.” In anticipation of
his trip, Lybass had been taking
lessons in Italian from Mr. Steph-
enson of Washington and Lee’s Ger-
man department.

But the water fountain problem
stayed with him. Lybass said that
there “just didn’t seem to be enough
public drinking fountains, which
seems strange when you consider
how many other kinds of fountains
there are in Italy.”

Although he paid short trips to
most of the larger cities in Italy,
Lybass favored Rome over any other
city he saw.

On his way back to the United
States, he stopped over in Paris.
“Everyone likes Paris,” he said. “But
I personally prefer Rome. It just
seems to be a happier place.”

“And that,” he added, “goes for
all of Italy.”

The Mess at Ole Miss: A Comment On Violence

(Editor’s note: Dr. Hodges, of
Washington and Lee’s department
of religion, is a native of Miss-
issippi and as such has been in
close contact with the problem of
desegregation in the South. The
Tuesday staff of the Ring-tum Phi
asked him to express his views
on the Oxford crisis. His comments
follow.)

By DR. LOUIS W. HODGES

James Meredith, a Mississippian,
is enrolled at Ole Miss. Two men are
dead as a result of riotous violence
on the night Meredith was placed
on the campus. Hundreds of thous-
ands of dollars have been spent and
property destroyed. The state leg-
islature called for, and then called
off, an investigation of liberal ele-
ments in the faculty of the Univer-
sity. Mr. Barnett has stood, and to
a degree still stands, in defiance of
the government of the United States.
Men from all over the South have
migrated to Oxford, many of them
armed, most of them to resist the
admission of Meredith to the Uni-
versity.

The list of major developments,
events with far-reaching implica-
tions, could be lengthened to sev-
eral pages.

 

Different observers explain these
developments in different ways.
Some of the students shout to
Meredith: “nigger, you have blood

Or. Hodges ...

on your hands now.” Others point
accusingly to the student body, to
“outsiders,” to Barnett.
A Symbol of Conflict |
However historians are eventually |
to assess responsibility for the cris-
is, Mississippi is to be viewed at

 

 

   

least as a symbol of deep-rooted
conflict in the contemporary South.
On the one hand, that state is re-
garded by the segregationist as the
final and most virtuous defender of
what is interestingly called “the
Southern way of life (as though
the crowd in the Sunday riot were
following that way of life).

Bigotry and Its Victims Involved

On the other hand, and in part for
the same reason, Mississippi is re-
garded by the Negro as the central
fortress of forces of segregation and
discrimination. Thus it is a first line
of attack. So it is that the racial
bigot and the victim of bigotry are
at once empathetically involved in
Oxford.

Since most of the readers of the |
R-t P are aware of the events and
the analyses of those events pre- |

 

sented through other media, it!
seems appropriate here to look at
a special facet of the Ole Miss|

crisis, viz., Sunday night’s violence. |
What was it like? Why did it oc-
cur? What are the likely results? |

A Kind of Calculated Violence

This crowd of students and “out-
siders” was patently not a “mob” in
the true and specialized sense of the '

| the governor’s office and in his pub- |

| crisis he spoke of fighting “race mix-

term. There was apparently no col-
lective or mass hysteria which re-
moved all semblance of rational
behavior. This was rather a kind
of calculated violence, violence en- |
tered into for a purpose, rather like
the Civil War than like a lynch
mob,

Violence and the threat of violence
has become come a part of Southern
strategy. Barnett pointed out that
if Meredith were forcibly enrolled
at Ole Miss violence would ensue.
It did. But his was a kind of self-
fulfilling prophecy: it amounted in
effect to an invitation to violence.
He talked of “dying” and “suffer-
ing” for the cause of segregation.
Both in his campaign for election to
the Oxford

lie utterances about

 

ing” to the end.
Segregation: a Lost Cause?

Mississippi has thus become some- |
thing of a symbol for the segrega-
tionist element in the South. Missis-

| sippi is making a last-ditch stand |
| for what most now recognize as a
| lost cause. But it is a stand which

has to be taken in order to save}
face. We cannot admit that we were
wrong; thus we must fight to show |

that we were really right, or at least |
that we still think so.

However reprehensible violence
may be, then, it does have a salu-
tary effect on the prejudiced mind. |

It goes like this: The racist South- |
erner has long lived with a guilty
conscience, a deep-seated sense of
guilt over his denial to the Negro of
basic human and _ constitutional
rights. In the words of Gunnar
Myrdal, he faces “an American di-
lemma.” His problem is that his
democratic creed is in effect denied
by his racial practice. Feelings of
guilt result.

 

Resist God or the Kennedys

In an effort to live with his guilt |
the racist builds elaborate struc- |
tures of justification for his treat-|
ment of the Negro. It is his attach- |
ment to these structures—e.g., that
“the Negro is happy this way’— |
that prevents a more sane solution
to problems like Ole Miss. He con-
fronts a new dilemma: either fight |
or deny God and the cause of right- |
eousness by allowing Meredith in
Ole Miss. He sees his choice as one |
between disobedience to God or!
disobedience to “the Kennedys.” |
(The racist cannot bear to think he
is fighting the democratic tradition |

of America so he substitutes a safer
name for his enemy.)

Thus two inner forces move the
racist to violence. One is his con-
scious conviction that segregation is

| morally right. The other is his whole

process of dealing with a sense of
guilt which grows out of the con-
flict between democratic creed and
his racist practice.

The Southerner’s Absolution

Strangely then, given the nature
of the second source of violence,
violence may bring a kind of abso-
lution to the segregationist. It may
serve as a kind of purgatory in
which he has gone down valiantly
fighting for a cause. He has not lost
face by giving up the cause but he
has been beaten by the odds against
him. This may well bring a sense of
relief and an openness to be moved
in the direction of desegration,

We may have to tolerate tempor-
ary violence as a necessary evil. In
order to live with himself the South-
erner needs and _ subconsciously
wants to suffer. Violence thus may
do more in the long run to help
than to hurt race relations, This does
not mean that we can or should con-
done violence; it does mean that we
live in a world where good sprouts
unexpectedly from evil.

Wasps’ Hawkins Inflicts Fatal Sting On WEL

*

Speedy Halfback Scores Five TDs

As E&H Snaps Win

By JOHN ALLGOOD

The rain that must fall into every
life poured on Washington and Lee's
hard-fighting football team Satur-
day.

Emory and Henry’s angry Wasps
unleashed this deadly deluge in the
form of halfback Earl Hawkins.
Hawkins turned, twisted, raced and
dragged his way to five touchdowns
and a 38-33 E&H victory.

Not only did this Emory and
Henry win avenge a 27-6 loss to
W&L last year, but it also snapped «
the Generals’ 2l-game non-losing +
string.

Hawkins Spoils Rally

For six minutes in the third period
it looked as if W&L would pull out
a win, but Hawkins, an intercepted
pass, a costly penalty and a 46-yard
desperation pass quickly snatched
the win away from the Generals.

Protecting a 33-28 lead early in
the third period, W&L had the a,
Wasps with third and nine at the "Wii
Emory 27.

End Bill Munsey, however, worked ©
his way behind two W&L defenders
and grabbed a 46-yard pass from
quarterback Jim Hawkins to give
the Wasps first and ten at the W&L
ai.

Seven plays put the Wasps on the
two with first and goal.

Goal Line Stand

Two cracks by fullback C. A.
Burton and one by halfback Charlie
Teefey failed to dent W&L’s goal —
line defense. i

Then Hawkins put on the hero’s
cloak that he had worn all day for
the final time. With one mighty jim
lunge he plunged over for the =i
Wasps’ winning tally.

The Wrecker
Hawkins was a one-man wreck-

The 6-4, 215-pound transfer from
Florida State University gained 117
yards rushing, scored five touch-
downs, including an 88-yard dash
with the opening kickoff, and passed
for three two-point conversions.

W&L’s defense couldn’t cope with
the bulldozing Hawkins. He either
shook off, side-stepped, or just drag-
ged would-be tacklers along with
him.

Only a one-handed ankle tackle
by Tommy Keesee pulled Hawkins
down for a loss (eight yards).

Outside of Stu Yoffe’s 36-yard
scoring reverse, Henry Sackett’s
23-yard dash, Tommy Keesee’s 22-
yard sprint with a direct snap, and
Dan Manson’s 13-yard gain, the
W&L offense could hardly gain more
than a yard at a time.

It was a day for long dashes.

Sackett raced 30 yards with the
second half kickoff, Bill David
sprinted 91 yards with a punt re-
turn, and Yoffe chugged 36 yards on
his reverse for the Generals’ third
quarter scoring.

Out of 12 punt and kickoff returns
the shortest was eight yards, and
nine were over 20 yards.

Sackett and Skip Chase tallied

Washington and Lee’s soccer team

Coach Joe Lyles described the

Field Goal
_ Nips Frosh

Washington and Lee’s freshmen
found an offense to go with their
iron-wall defense Friday, but still
couldn’t capture a victory.

Staunton Military Academy’s Bill
Anderson booted a 22-yard field
goal in the second quarter to give
Staunton a 3-0 victory.

The Light Brigade’s new offense
came through the airways as the
Brigade picked up 125 yards pass-
ing.

Roll-out Pass

“We found our quarterbacks were
so short that they couldn’t spot
their receivers downfield using the
drop back pass,’ coach Dana Swan
said, “therefore, we switched to a
roll-out pass which worked beauti-
fully.”

Halfback Mike Goode topped the
W&L receivers with three catches
for 84 yards. Two of Goode’s recep-
tions set up potential scoring threats
for the Light Brigade.

“We won everything but the ball
game,” Swan said.

Twice the Generals moved within
scoring range, but each drive was
thwarted.

A Costly Fumble

The Brigade’s charge ground to
a halt once because of a fumble and
once because of Staunton’s defense.

W&L’s defense again stood out.
Linebackers Jeff Novinger and Dave
Shufflebarger anchored the stout
Brigade line which held Staunton
to 160 yards total offense.

Shufflebarger with 34 yards in five
carries, Goode, and quarterbacks
Larry Craig (2-5 for 50 yards and
John Curran (4-10 for 75 yards)
starred on offense.

The Sabers, student combo or-
ganized by several freshmen last

year, has been on the move.

Carry-overs from last year in-

WHAT TO WEAR TILL THE DOCTOR COMES

Now that you have enrolled and paid your fees and bought
your books and found your way around campus and learned to
hate your roommate, it is time to turn to the most important
aspect of college life. I refer, of course, to clothes.

What does Dame Fashion decree for the coming school year?
(Incidentally, Dame Fashion is not, as many people belie, a
fictitious character. She was a real Englishwoman who lived in
Elizabethan times and, indeed, England is forever in her debt.
During the invasion of the Spanish Armada, Dame Fashion—
not yet a Dame but a mere, unlettered country lass named
Moll Flanders—during the invasion, I say, of the Spanish
Armada, this dauntless girl stood on the white cliffs of Dover
and turned the tide of battle by rallying the drooping morale of
the British fleet with this stirring poem of her own composition:

Don’t be gutless,
Men of Britain.
Swing your cutlass,
We ain't quittin’.
Smash the Spanish,
Sink their boats,
Make ’em vanish,
Like a horse makes oats,

For Good Queen Bess,
Dear sirs, you gotta
Make a mess
Of that Armada,

You won't fail!
Knock ’em flat!
Then we'll drink ale

    
 

  

{1 1490

And stuff like that.

As a reward for these inspirational verses Queen Elizabeth
dubbed her a Dame, made her Poet Laureate, and gave her
the Western Hemisphere except Duluth. But this was not the
extent of Dame Fashion’s service to Queen and country. In
1589 she invented the laying hen, and she was awarded a life-
time pass to Chavez Ravine. But she was not to end her days
in glory. In 1591, alas, she was arrested for overtime jousting
and imprisoned for thirty years in a butt of malmsey. This later
became known as Guy Fawkes Day.)

But I digress. Let us get back to campus fashions. Certain to
be the rage again this year is the cardigan (which, curiously
enough, was named after Lerd Cardigan, who commanded the
English fleet against the Spanish Armada. The sweater is only
one product of this remarkable Briton’s imagination. He also
invented the glottal stop, the gerund, and the eyelid, without
which winking, as we know it today, would not be possible),

But I digress. The cardigan,

I say, will be back, which is, I

believe, cause for rejoicing. Why? Beeause the cardigan has
nice big pockets in which te carry your Marlboro Cigarette

and that, good friends, is ample reason for celebration as all of
you will agree who have enjoyed Marlboro’s fine, comfortable,
mellow flavor and Marlboro’s filter. So why don’t you slip into
your cardigan and hie yourself to your tobacconist for some
good Marlboros? They come in soft pack or flip-top box. Cardi-

gans come in pink for girls and blue for boys,

*

Cardigans or pullovers—it’s a matter of taste...

And so is

Marlboro a matter of taste—the best taste that can possibly
be achieved by experienced growers and blenders—by sci-
ence, diligence, and tender loving care. Try @ pack.

Politics?

Once again the campus is “alive” with political activity.
The two parties have selected their candidates and the cam-
paigns have begun. However, is this really the case? Certainly,
we have an election complete with candidates and posters, but
is it really a race?

Each year, the political groups on this campus get righteous
for a couple of days and put on a show for all of us to watch.
As far as we can remember, very little in a constructive way
is accomplished. The Honor System is lauded, apathy is at-
tacked, and the election is run.

Of course the parties make a few promises, but, by the
same token, very few of them are ever kept. It is rather shame-
ful to admit, but our campus elections all too often develop
into a power struggle between the two political groups or into
a popularity contest between the opposing candidates.

We must admit that the present political situation is un-
balanced. One of our parties enters any election with a com-
fortable margin. With this in mind, one would wonder of there
was any race at all. As is true with out state politics, the contest

is decided in the party caucus or in the primary.

Is this a healthy situation? Since the party alignment is
determined by fraternities and not by individuals, all too often
the voter has his mind made up for him.

It is our hope that the freshman class will enter this com-
ing election with an open mind. A vote should be cast for the

candidates as individuals, and not the political party.

 

 

 

Letters To The Editor oe

 

 

Honts Accuses R-t P
Of Collusion In Pic

Dear Editor:

I would like to explain the abso-
lute irrelevance of the picture ap-
pearing on page 1 of the Tuesday
Edition of the Ring-tum Phi. The
object of the picture was to give
publicity to the Southern Collegian,
I think, which the cutline did not
do.

While I certainly would b2 a fool
to object to the implication of the
cutline, I cannot take the credit for
implied action which did not occur.
I only took the girl’s picture.

It is my feeling that there was
collusion involved. Collusion by
Roger Paine et als., who think the
Collegian is unfit and non-intellec-
tual. I would therefore demand
an EC investigation of this person,
Paine, who is, I believe, responsible
for the cutline. If he is guilty, as I
supect he is, I feel it is only proper
that he be sentenced to reading
only that excellent competitor of
ours for the rest of the year. I
speak, of course, of Shenandoah.

Thank you for printing this letter
and I hope you'll be looking for
Sue in the Openings Issue.

Sincerely,
GEORGE HONTS, Editor
Southern Collegian

Approach Of NAACP
Viewed As Ineffective

Dear Editor:

I am writing this letter to find out
some information. What is the
NAACP trying to accomplish? I
thought that the NAACP was an
organization aimed at improving
the status of the American Negro.
To the contrary, it has succeeded
only in degrading and depriving
Negroes, and at the same _ time
alienating them from white so-
ciety.

Whenever the NAACP enters a
new campaign it is almost certain
that there will be trouble, and pos-
sibly violence. The headlines of
newspapers are filled with such
cases. The NAACP seems to thrive
on headlines. But are headlines and
violence going to help the Negro
gain acceptance?

Prince Edward County was the
scene of the first federal deseg-
regation fight. The NAACP moved
in and demanded immediate and
complete integration. The white pop-
ulation had formulated a plan of
partial and gradual integration, but
this plan was rejected by the
NAACP. The result was the clos-
ing of all public schools in the
county. Negroes have now been
without schools for almost five years.
State tuition grants available to all,
white or black, who wish to con-
tinue their education are denied the
Negroes by the NAACP. If they ac-
cept they lose their membership
and friends. Only now are the
Negroes of Prince Edward County
realizing the true nature of the
NAACP and deserting its ranks.

In Mississippi, the NAACP suc-
ceeded in enrolling the first Negro
student in the history of the Uni-

 

versity of Mississippi. This occured
only after federal troops, number-
ing in the thousands, were called
in, student riots broke out, and
two men lost their lives. This may
not have happened, you say, if
Governor Barnett had followed the
federal court order. However, it
could also have been prevented if
the NAACP had taken steps to inte-
grate on the elementary levels, and
not at the college level where all
feelings toward integration have
been formed and firmly encamped.

To me the NAACP is just another
radical organization looking for sen-
sation and headlines. The NAACP
is impersonal. It lives off the suf-
ferings of its race. It extracts mem-
bership dues from those who can
least afford it. What the Negro needs
is an organization that cares about
the individual. A respectable organ-
ization will be able to represent the
Negro and eventually gain the sup-
port of the white population.

By building up self-respect, in-
centive and ingenuity, the Negro
can make gradual strides toward de-
segregation. It is impossible to tear
down a wall of tradition overnight
especially one as great as that of
Southern society and culture. How-
ever, the NAACP is trying to erad-
icate it in one blow.

Sincerely,
LEWIS MILLER

a
Or

By KENNETH LANE
Asst. Managing Editor
Traditionally, the Editorial page
has tried to pay tribute to those
institutions on campus which play
a key role within the University.
It is with this in mind that we
salute one of our most instrumental
organizations—the “13” Club.
Because its particular field of
self-fulfillment is in the social cate-
gory, this secret society has lately
been underestimated. I am sure, for
example, that many readers smirk
when the ideals of such a club are
applauded. But why? How has “so-
cial” come to have such a spurious
connotation? Isn’t it just as im-
portant a part of college activity
as athletics or curricula?

In eulogizing the “13” Club, we
wish to perform a double service:
first, an objective evaluation of a
campus institution; secondly, an
ironing out of some common mis-
conceptions about the ideals for
which this institution stands.

In every phase of campus life,
recognition is given those who evi-
dence superiority. In the academics,
prestige for those who excel is of-
fered in the grading system. In ath-
letics, there are Varsity Sports and
honorable mention in newspaper ar-
ticles. And likewise in social, there
is the need for some way to dis-
tinguish the proficient.

Something to Strive For

The “13” Club is the key incen-
tive-building factor in this last
field. It is this prestige organization
which brings out the campus stud-
horses. Without something to strive
for, these men might never foresee
their true potential. The agonizing
Monday morning hangovers would
just be too much without having
some goal.

This competition to be selected
among the hard core of stallions is

weekend from the underclassmen.
In this way, the drive for social self-
realization kept on a_ healthy,
competitive pitch. No one can say
that the “13” Club isn’t doing its
job to check university apathy.

Yet with the changing times,
the Club has assumed an even
nobler cause. It stands against the
tide of public opinion, which is
threatening to take from youth
some of its valuable folkways.

For the modern trend in educa-
tion is becoming dangerously one-
directional. We have, the sages
claim, reached an age of speciali-
zation and tomorrow’s leaders must
be trained to perpetuate it. Conse-

is

 

quently, the academic standards
have been raised to unprecedented |
levels; the curricula have been}
tightened; and classroom competi- |
tion has reached a slavish intensity. |

Nevertheless, the “13” Club is
making a relentless stand. Boldly,|
it shouts Carlyle’s “Everlasting _
to an increasingly philistine society. |
In an environment which threatens |
to constrain individuality and re-|
duce human beings to atoms, the |
“13” Club remains adamant in its |
principles.

The Need To Survive
Washington and Lee has always |
prided itself in its liberal educa- |
tion. It is widely famous for pro-'

 

springing up new prospects every

ducing the all-around leaders. It
stands on the belief that what this
country really needs are men with
broad foundations. The University
should not retreat in these standards.

Admittedly, the outlook is not too
bright for the “13” Club. Last year,
one of its long-standing contempor-
aries, the “Mongolian Minks,” was
banned from the campus. Futher-
more, the high academic standards
are detracting from the other de-
partments of college.

But should the “13” ever die, it
will be a great loss to the Univer-
sity. For dying with it will be the
cause for which it stands— the
ideal of self-perfection in all ranges
of human experience.

 

 

   

 

Traditions Valued As A Means
Of Preserving Our Uniqueness

By BILL NOELL
Friday Columnist

Washington and Lee is not unique
among American universities solely
because of its rich
past and _ conse-

tradition; other

notable founders,
successful alumni,
and campuses)

alone in our con-|
tributions to this state or to the)
nation, though we do take justifiable |
pride in them. We certainly are not)
the only institution to stress full |
development of the individual, so-|
cially or scholastically. Rather, it!
is in terms of the image which,
Washington and Lee connotes, that
our measure of distinction has be-|
come significant and unparalleled. |

That image is not the result of
our unthinking and unwilled devo

parent. Aside from introducing up-
perclassmen and Lexington mer-
chants to new students on the cam-
pus, the beanie is indicative of the
man, with whom the student body
and alumni are sharing the most
valuable conventions imaginable—
those which instill a sense of pride
in the individual—pride in him-
self as a man, and pride in this uni-
versity, which it is his calling to
represent.

Likewise, the same ideas will
argue well for the existence and
activity of any assimilation commit-

person, a thoughtless remark...
singly or in combination, these
things can destroy in an_ instant

what only decades have built. Those
who would characterize the commit-
tee as “The better clothes commit-
tee” or as “the bigger smile com-
mittee” are missing the broader im-

both the maintenance of a signifi-

Sackett Named W eek’s Star
For Play In EGH Contest

For his fine play against Emory |
and Henry last Saturday, Henry
Sackett has been chosen by the
Washington and Lee coaches as the
athlete of the week.

Sackett highlighted his perfor-
mance last week with a_ninety-
three yard kick-

off return to start
the second half as
the Generals lost
a close 38-33
match.
The fleet half-
back also scored
on a one - yard
plunge in the first
period to give
himself a total of
twelve points for
the day.
Against Emory and Henry,
ket carried eight _times

 

Sackett

Sac-
for 47

 

yards and a highly respectable av-
erage of 5.9 yards per carry.

Sackett has been an outstanding
performer in all three games so
far, as he leads the team in scor-
ing with 22 points. He has carried
20 times this season gaining 126
yards for a 6.3 average.

He is second in the state scoring
race, behind Emory and Henry’s
Earl Hawkins.

Besides his rushing ability, Sac-
kett has been extremely valuable
for his kickoff returns and sharp
defensive play this season.

Note From The Past

In the 1916 season, forty-six
years ago, the Washington and

Lee Generals rolled over the Ran-
dolph-Macon Yellow Jackets in a
decisive 80-0 football game.

 

W&L Leads New CAC In Scoring;

Centre First Conference Foe

Southwestern at Memphis became
the first member of the newly
formed College Athletic Conference
to record a conference football vic-
tory Saturday as the Lynx defeated
Centre College at Memphis, 20-14.

On the basis of performances in
their first three games of the cur-
rent season, the Lynx also assum-
ed dominance of the new league in
most statistical departments.

Other members were active against
non-conference opponents, with Se-
wanee besting Hampden-Sydney, 22-
7, and Washington and Lee losing to
Emory and Henry, 38-33, for the
Generals first loss in 22 games over
a span of four seasons.

Although Washington and Lee

players trail in most statistical
departments, the Generals are |
pace-setters in scoring. Junior |

halfback Henry Sackett has 22 |
points on three touchdowns and
two conversion runs, while team-
mate fullback Tommy Keesee
trails with 16 i on two TD's

Agnew, Hourigan, Hugh Harwood
of Southwestern and Kenneth
Kell of Centre all have 14 points.

Last Saturday’s games featured
the “home run” play by budding
conference stars. Washington and
Lee’s Bill David returned an E&H
punt 94 yards for a touchdown, while
Sackett contributed a 93-yard kick-
off runback for another score.
Sewanee’s Agnew went 84 yards to
score with a Hampden-Sydney punt,
and teammate Jim Stewart raced
56 yards with an intercepted pass.
Bill Harwood of Southwestern con-
tributed a 47-yard run from scrim-
mage for a Lynx TD, and Wash-

corded a 36-yard scoring run on a
reverse.

The Generals may have been
sharply stung by the Wasps of Em-
ory and Henry last week, but they
will seek to return the favor Sat-
urday against the Yellow Jackets
of Randolph-Macon.

Once again faced with an away
game and a Homecoming situation,
W&L has every reason to want to
revenge for last week’s 33-38 loss
to Earl Hawkins of Emory and
Henry.

The

Generals will be facing a

 

Randolph-Macon team which
been considerably bolstered by strong
freshman additions. This will give
them greater depth and tend to
minimize the depth advantage W&L
has usually had with the three

Washington and Lee’s soccer team
defeated Virginia Tech, 3-1, on
Smith Field Wednesday.

VPI got off te a quick start and
surprised the Generals by scor-
ing within five minutes of the start
of the game to lead 1-0.

The Generals did not take long to
retaliate, as Co-captain Bob Pagano
shot and scored from thirty yards
out mid-way through the first period
to tie the game.

The Generals dominated play for

the remainder of the contest, dis-
playing hustle and strong team
work,

Penalty Kick

A VPI penalty in the second quar-
ter allowed right wing Steve Hib-
bard to attempt a penalty shot
which he put by the Tech goalie.

Throughout the second half
W&L dominated the ball but the
Generals were unable to score
until, with two minutes left, fresh-

~* man Tim Henry scored from the

inside-right position.

Fullback and Co-captain Tom

played an exceptionally

as he broke up several Tech scoring
threats.

Especially good performances were
turned in by halfbacks Frank Wake-
field and Bruce Jackson. Bob Pagano
and Steve Hibbard were most in-
strumental in carrying the play of
the forward line.

The soccer team’s season record
is 3-1, with ten games remaining
in the season. The team’s next match
is against a perenially strong Lynch-
burg College team.

IFC Nixes
Pledging

Proposals

By RANDY JONES

The IFC unanimously approved a
1.0 grade point ratio for freshman
initiates last night, at the same time
rejecting four other proposals.

The second proposal—that all
freshmen having less than a 4 at
mid-semester be automatically sus-
pended from pledge duties, dropped
from the fraternity roles, and inelig-
ible to be rushed by any other fra-
ternity during this suspension—was
defeated by a 12 to 6 vote.

Reasons for its defeat were that
those affected would probably be
permanently separated from the fra-
ternity, which would harm not only
the fraternity but the individuals
concerned. Also, the eligibility for
initiation of those attaining a 1.0
grade point ratio at the end of the
semester would be seriously threat-
ened.

Third Proposal Falls Flat

Drafted as an attempt to combat
the sophomore academic lag, the
third proposal received no support.
The failure to make a .75 in either
semester of the freshman year would
prohibit a sophomore from living or
eating in the house, and cause him
to be dropped from the fraternity
roles, under this motion.

It was amended that the meal
clause of this proposal be dropped |
and Dean Atwood replied _ that, |
“Some sophomores would be re-
warded by not being required to
live in the house.”

Defeat of this proposal was close-
ly related to the ruling that all
concerned must be depledged if |
they were to be dropped from the |
fraternity rolls.

Pian Called Useless

One IFC member added that by
the sophomore year, the student has

usually established his pattern of |

study and that this plan would mag representing 416 students and

| 138 guests
| that may come in the next week.

a useless punishment for the fra-
ternity and the individual.

The last two proposals were au-
tomatically defeated because of their
relationship to the third: Those be-
low a .75 are to be placed on fra-
ternity scholastic probation; and
When a student achieves a .75 the
probation is immediately lifted.

In order for the 1.0 grade point
ratio ruling to become an addition to
the IFC constitution, it must be
again approved at the next xt meeting.

d| ‘Canvass Town

For Robinson

By RUSTY RYLAND

Sunday night the Young Repub-

| elect J. Kenneth Robinson as Con-

 

| his political views,

gressman from the seventh district.

Thirty-eight W&L Young Re-
publicans and a group of twenty-
four from Sweetbriar took part in
the three hour canvass.

They passed out a campaign pub-
lication entitled “The Robinson
Courier,’ a newspaper expressing
and other po-
litical literature.

Emphasis was placed upon invit-
ing people to attend the rally tonight
at 8 p.m. at Lexington High School.
Interested students are invited to
attend and meet Mr. Robinson at a

| reception afterwards.

All day tomorrow, YR club mem-
bers will be traveling in a ear cara-
van with Robinson throughout this
area. A calliope has been obtained
for publicity purposes.

Dr. C. F. Phillips, the club’s fac-
ulty advisor, was cited by Club
President Bob Wheelock for his as-
sistance with the club. Dr. Phillips is
also handling publicity for Robin-
son’s campaign.

John Lundy, John Tipson (cor-
responding secretary), and Pete

A New Paper,
‘The Question,’
Blasts Campus

By SHANNON JUNG

The Question, a new radical sheet,
was first introduced to the W&L
campus last night by co-editors
Dick Herman, President of the Phi
Epsilon Pi House, and by Lamar
Lamb, Sophomore Executive Com-
mitteeman.

The stated purpose of The Ques-
tion is “to provide an outlet for
opinion on topics of a local, national,
and international nature.” Citing the
limit of its subject matter as the
limit of the imagination, the co-edi-
tors solicit ideas and contributions
of any nature.

The motivation for initiating this
sheet is, as the publication states,
to make it possible for those un-
represented by “the vested interests”
to express themselves.

The second motivation is the
avoidance of such repressions as
domination of campus media by

minority interests.

In the first article, by co-editor
Dick Herman, The Question criticiz-
es the E.C’s policy of keeping cer-
tain matters (e.g., an affair con-
cerning the Honor System and the
ABC store) and the E.C.’s decision
about such matters as clandestine
as possible.

The sheet goes on to criticize the
E.C.’s not wishing to take a stand
on the issue—one way or another.

Since Lamb is a member of the
EC, the editors are well able to
promise full and accurate coverage
of all EC meetings.

The Question congratulates the
EC for including athletics under the
Honor System.

Identifying the prevailing attitude
on the W&L campus as conservatism,
the paper gives
to back up this statement.

a comfortable majority of 153 to

*106 over the Independent Party’s
Joe Miller. However, he was not
supported by a majority of his class-
mates, 74 of whom failed to cast
a_ ballot.

Only 78 per cent of the freshman
class voted in the election, giving
Watson 46 per cent of the total
class vote.

Freshman law student Myers won
by a count of 22 to 14 over Roger
Kelsey after a preliminary ballot-
ing had narrowed the field.

Other freshmen law class officers
were also chosen last night: Mike
Bowerman was elected president;
Andy Anderson, vice president; Ley-
burn Mosby, secretary; and Roger
Kesley, historian.

For the University Party, it was
a continuation of the nearly com-
plete domination it has exhibited
since the Independents won a ma-
jority of student body offices at
the end of the 1960-61 school year.
More important the election was a
highly successful test of a political
alignment which included the Sig-
ma Phi Epsilon house for the first
time.

For Watson it was a brilliant vic-
tory over an opponent who was so
well known in the class and had
presented such an imposing list of
qualifications that many considered
him the favorite in spite of his nom-
ination by the minority party. Miller
had won the name contest at Fresh-
man Camp and had been elected a
co-captain of the freshman football
team.

The percentage of voting freshmen,
lowest in years, may reflect the
presence of a high number of non-
fraternity men in the class, since
fraternities push hard to get out a
vote for their party candidate. Or
it could reflect apathy resulting from
the unequal lineup, which had dis-
couraged interest among the minori-
ty party and among non-fraternity
students.

There was, as usual in freshman
elections, no real issue involved.

Nevertheless Watson in particu-
| lar campaigned hard, and his elec-
| tion is apparently the reward for
his efforts. He had visited every UP
fraternity and had canvassed the
| dorm in detail. This vigorous cam-
paigning has not been a Big Clique
| habit in past freshman classes, and

Watson could well have based his
campaign on the memory of the In-
dependent sweep in the freshman
| class last spring. In elections for
' sophomore offices, the Independents
dorm and carried on
|a person-to-person campaign to
| decisively defeat the overconfident
UP candidates.

Watson made no comment on his
election other than to describe him-
self “extremely pleased” at the out-
come. He carries a bright high school
record into office .

young Confederate cavalryman
who alone survives the massacre of

Davis became interested in the
setting of the story through the fact
that his great-grandfather actually
was one of the unit to which the
story's main character belongs. The
outfit was called McClausland’s Cav-
valry, and was a full brigade under
the command of Brig. Gen John
McClausland, a VMI graduate and
relative of Davis’ grandfather.

In “The Deadlier Bruise” the Mc-
Clausland brigade is depicted as the

the |

main striking arm of Jubal Barly in
the 1864 Valley Campaign. The unit
| is sent on a raid of Pennsylvania
and burned the town of Chambers-
burg, as in fact it did in 1864. On
its way back from this raid, Mc-
Clausland’s Cavalry was trapped and
attacked during the night by a
Yankee outfit which killed or cap-
tured nearly the entire Confederate
brigade. The battle took place at
what is now Mooresfield, West Vir-
ginia.

Davis has written novel, Two
Soldiers, which came out in 1956. A

THE RING

-TUM PHI

Tuesday Edition

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

An Answer
For “The Question’

We note with interest the debut of a new campus publica-
tion entitled The Question, and rather presumptuously sub-
titled “Freedom and Responsibility in an Expanding Uni-
verse.” Its format will be familiar to those who have followed
Protest, and its emergence promises a new campaign to combat
campus apathy.

The editors, Dick Herman and Lamar Lamb, have, in
their first issue, assured themselves of at least a mild contro-
versy by taking a poke at the Ring-tum Phi’s coverage of EC
meetings, and by insinuating that we are a “vested interest.”
Quite naturally, we feel obliged to answer:

1.Three out of four EC meetings are boring affairs. They
deal with very trivial matters, and their coverage in the Ring-
tum Phi would be a waste of space.

2. In regard to Herman’s diatribe on the EC’s ABC store
decision: both editors of the Ring-tum Phi agreed that Mr.
Herman’s understanding of the Honor System was woefully
inadequate, and that his letter irresponsibly misrepresented
the facts. The student government had nothing to do with the
editors’ decision to turn down the letter.

In conclusion, we would like to toss out a little truism
that the editors of The Question might ponder in their next
issue: raising questions is not particularly difficult, but pro-
viding answers sometimes requires a little thought.

Reflections On Beanies

Judging by the College Board scores, this year’s Freshman
class is the most intellectually sophisticated class in W&L’s
history—and judging by Bill Noell’s excellent article in last
Friday’s Ring-tum Phi, this class is too sophisticated to wear
beanies.

Are beanies so degrading? Are we asking too much when
we ask that freshmen admit they are freshmen by wearing
beanies? Is the wearing of beanies a barbaric ordeal?

A great many freshmen seem to think so.

Thus the student body has only one alternative: let fly
with the assimilation cards.

The Conservative Society

The ideology of American conservatism, hitherto little
known to the majority of W&L students, has come more to
light in recent months. In the latter half of the past year and
already in the opening weeks of the new term members of
Washington and Lee’s Conservative Society have made com-
mendable steps toward setting forth the doctrines of their
political philosophy.

Whether or not we happen to concur with the policies of
the conservatives, members of the Conservative Society de-
serve a pat on the back for the excellent speakers such as Rus-
sell Kirk, that they have brought to W&L and for the continu-
ing hard work that is so obvious in the fruits of their attempts to

 

spread the appeal of conservative thinking.

NAACP Defended

Dear Editors and Mr. Miller,

Perhaps I can bring to light that

 

“some information” you're looking
for. The NAACP is a logical organ-
ization of leadership for a group
which has been stepped on and
down-trodden since its presence on
this soil.

The NAACP began to grow in
1954 to counter those southern forces
which were preventing the colored
person from attaining his inherent
civil rights.

Those states with weaker tradi-
tions of discrimination complied with
the court orders of desegregation.
But in those regions in which the
links, or shackles, whichever you
prefer, of narrow-mindedness and
blind acceptance of habit were too
strong to be broken by moral values
or a court order, the state of the
Negro remained the same as ever.

The efforts of the NAACP have|
succeeded only in alienating the
Negro from those people who were
in earnest opposition to the Negro’s
gaining the same rights as the white
people.

I do admit that your statement
“whenever the NAACP enters a new
campaign it is almost certain that)
there will be trouble and violence,’ |
is quite true. However, this violence |
has been propagated by the whites, |
the NAACP didn’t organize the riots |
at Oxford.

Concerning headlines: How does}
this group thrive on them? National |
attention to the problems at Oxford |
simply worsened matters by en-|
couraging more people to enter both)
the verbal and physical conflicts. |

Many people ask why the NAACP |
won't accept gradual step by step |
integration. The answer is that it}
will, when offered this opportunity. |
It did happen in St. Louis and Mem-
phis. In the majority of segregated |
cities the local officials absolutely |
refuse to discuss even gradual inte-|
gration, as in Albany, Ga.,

 

South |
Carolina and Mississippi.

The answer which I believe the |
NAACP is in favor of is a gradual
integration on a three-level system
(superior, average, below average) |
which would allow each person to|
advance according to his capabilities. |

Of course, this reasonable pace |
will be too fast for a snail but the}
change has to come and it might as|
well begin right now.

Sincerely,
JOHN SAMET |

The magazine was Esquire and its |

era—new, daring and successful.

Local clothier Arthur Silver lent
the Ring-tum Phi a copy of the first

ing for 50 cents, Esquire declared
on the credits page of Vol. I, No. 1,
that “Esquire aims to become the
common denominator of masculine
interests—to be all things to all
men.” And tody, that’s just what the
magazine is.

It was a big and flashy periodical,
with 36 features in full color—color
as technically good as that used in
most of today’s slicks.

But it was impressive in another
way, for splattered all over the
cover were names of the contribu-
tors: articles by Hemingway, Ring
Lardner and Nicholas Murray But-
ler; fiction by, among others, John
Dos Passos, Marley Callaghan,
Erskine Caldwell and Douglas Fair-
banks, Jr.

Gene Tunney and Bobby Jones
had sports features in the first Es-
quire, and Joseph Auslander and
Audrey Wurdemann had _ written
some good verse for the magazine’s
debut.

Bread Lines and Hobo Havens

There were 37 cartoons in the first
Esquire, ten concerned with sex and
about 20 smacking of the Great De-
pression. Bread lines and Hobo
Havens, Dance Marathons and Wall
Street paupers were poked fun at.

The advertisements haven’t chang-
ed much in basic format. They were
then, as they are now, classy, elite
and voguish.

Even some of the same clothing

from the rooftops are no help at

but there is no obligation for intel-

that if shooting begins, the roof-

do their fighting vocally. It has ever

that the Soviet Union would accept

America cower before all Soviet
threats. What I am suggesting is that
we recognize that the Soviet Union
has staked its prestige on the protec-
tion of Cuba and that it is not in
our interest to let Mr. K. paint him-
self in a corner there. It is not good
atomic diplomacy to force “show-
downs.” It is good atomic diplomacy
avoiding them. After all, what hap-
pens if we don’t back down at all
and neither do they? An atomic
blast is, I think, the answer, and
who has a future after that?

A “Peaceful Blockade”

Is there not then some measure
short of invasion that will get us
rid of Castro? Senator Goldwater
suggests a “peaceful blockade.” It
is former President Eisenhower who
answered this when he said he “had

never heard of a peaceful block-
ade.” The general is right: Inter-

national Law defines a blockade as

 

e Cuban Situation?

“an act of war.” Just last week
Congress released figures on just
whose ships are docking at Cuban
ports. Great Britain, Spain and Nor-
way headed the list. West Germany
was just below them. A_ blockade
would likely get us in trouble with
our Allies. What profit for us is in
this?

I would suggest (as others have
suggested) that we should neither
invade nor blockade, though we
should prepare to do both if the
situation worsens. Righ now, let Mr.
Castro stew in his own juice. His
economy is in collapse. He is a drain
on the Soviet Union who must con-
tinuously bail him out of his self-
inflicted catastrophes and who may
well tire of this game. He poses no
military threat to the United States
(a rocket in Moscow can hit Wash-
ington well as one based in
Cuba) and there is no military au-
thority I know who seriously claims
otherwise.

In summation, Mr. Castro annoys
us. No doubt about this at all, But a!

as

great nation can stand some annoy-
ing. It takes a bit of learning, but
it can be done. In the meantime, we
can hand Mr. Castro his fair share
of rope, and in its own way, and
contrary to its own purposes, the
Soviets will hand him rope, too.
Let us give Mr. Castro every op-
portunity to hang himself. When his
economy comes down around his
ears and his people reach the “point
of no return,” then we can make our
moves with sureness and dispatch
and we can have our friends South
of the Border on our side and _ not
against us.

Keesee Gains 164 yards

With Keesee carrying for 164
yards in 19 carries and Yoffee reel-
ing off 93 yards in nine tries, the
Generals reminded of their awesome |
running attacks of the past two
years. In 55 plays the Generals
gained 336 yards, a neat 6.0 average |
per carry.

Despite this prolific ground game,
Washington and Lee had to resort to
its usually most ineffective wea-
pon—the pass—for its second touch-
down.

Here again Keesee was the hero. |

Taking a handoff from quarter- |
back Chuck Lane, Keesee lofted a
high 27-yard aerial to end Buck
Ogilvie, all alone in the end zone.

Fumbles spoiled two W&L drives
and four straight off tackle plays |
failed to get a first down at the |
Randolph-Macon 10 on _ another |
drive. |

W&L took the opening kickoff and |
needed only four minutes to go 70
yards for six points. Yoffe carried
the last 25 yards on a reverse around
left end.

Jackets Bounce Back

W&L’s lead was short lived, how-
ever, as Randolph-Macon quickly
proved what Emory and Henry
hinted last week—that W&L’s de-
fense couldn’t contain its opponents
too successfully.

The Yellow Jackets, after being
set back to their 15 on the ensuing
kickoff, marched 85 yards in 19 plays
to go ahead, 7-6.

On the third play of the drive
freshman quarterback Skip D’Al-
lesandro discovered the Generals
had a leaky pass defense when he
hit end Bill Bailey on a jump pass.

Nine plays and four successful
passes later the Jackets had third
and seven at the W&L 29.

Interference Costly

Again D’Allesandro faded to pass
to Bailey at the W&L 20. An over-
eager defender, however, shoved
Bailey and earned a pass interfer-
ence call.

D’Allesandro fired another pass,
sent halfback Don Way into the line
twice, fired two more aerials—the
last one a seven yarder to end
Charles Ashby—for the touchdown.
Harry Hulvey booted the extra point.

For the drive D’Allesandro com-
pleted eight passes in eight attempts.

Randolph-Macon regained posses-
sion quickly after the red team
failed to move the football.

The red team couldn’t hold the
Jackets either, as they moved from
their 35 to the W&L 30.

Blue Team Stars

With first and ten at the 30 the
blue unit entered the game. Led by
Mike Sheffey, Bob Payne, Keesee,
Jim Sylvester, and George Gossman,
the first team halted the Jackets four
inches short of a a first down.

HAPPINESS CAN’T BUY MONEY

Can education bring happiness?

This is a question that in recent years has caused much
lively debate and several hundred stabbings among American
college professors. Some contend that if a student’s intellect
is sufficiently aroused, happiness will automatically follow.
Others say that to concentrate on the intellect and ignore the
rest of the personality can only lead to misery.

I myself favor the second view, and I offer in evidence the
well-known case of Agathe Fusco.

Agathe, a forestry major, never got anything less than a
straight “A”, was awarded her B.T. (Bachelor of Trees) in
only two years, her M.S.B. (Master of Sap and Bark) in only
three, and her D.B.C. (Doctor of Blight and Cutworms) in
only four.

Academic glory was hers. Her intellect was the envy of
every intellect fan on campus. But was she happy? The
answer, alas, was no. Agathe—she knew not why—was miser-
able, so miserable, in fact, that one day while walking across
campus, she was suddenly so overcome with melancholy that
she flang herself, weeping, upon the statue of the Founder.

By and by a liberal arts major named R. Twinkle Plenty came
by with his yoyo. He noted Agathe’s condition. “How come
you're so unhappy, hey?” said R. Twinkle.

“Suppose you tell me, you dumb old liberal arts major,”
replied Agathe peevishly.

   

a ile
. cae vatrever Sted 4. Pealboro’ cU6CLE: r

“All right, I will,” said R. Twinkle. “You are unhappy for
two reasons. First, because you have been so busy stuffing
your intellect that you have gone and starved your psyche. I’ve
got nothing against learning, mind you, but a person oughtn’t
to neglect the pleasant, gentle amenities of life—the fun
things. Have you, for instance, ever been to a dance?”

Agathe shook her head.

‘Have you ever watched a sunset? Written a poem? Smoked
a Marlboro Cigarette?”

Agathe shook her head.

“Well, we'll fix that right now!” said R. Twinkle and gave her
a Marlboro and struck a match.

She puffed, and then for the first time in twelve or fifteen
years, she smiled. ‘‘Wow!”’ she cried. ‘““Marlboros are a fun thing!
What flavor! What filter! What pack or box! What a lot to
like! From now on I will smoke Marlboros, and never have
another unhappy day!”

“Hold!” said R. Twinkle. “Marlboros alone will not solve
your problem—only half of it. Remember I said there were
two things making you unhappy?”

“Oh, yeah,” said Agathe. “What's the other one?”

“How long have you had that bear trap on your foot?”
said R, Twinkle.

“T stepped on it during a field trip in my freshman year,”
said Agathe. “I keep meaning to have it taken off.”

‘Allow me,” said R. Twinkle and removed it.

“Land sakes, what a relief!” said Agathe, now totally happy,
and took R, Twinkle’s hand and led him to a Marlboro vendor's
and then to a justice of the peace.

Today Agathe is a perfectly fulfilled woman, both intellect-
wise and personalitywise. She lives in
house with R. Twinkle and their 17 children,
busy in the forestry game. Only last month, in fact, reECUINE

Southerner’s ... deep-sez ae
guilt over his denial to the
Negro of basic human and sanitiltis |
tional rights.”

In seeking to explain the violence
and bloodshed surrounding events |
at Ole Miss, Dr. Hodges answers the |
question “why did it occur?” with |
this analysis: Southerners, he asserts,
an inner conflict between a be-
lief in the moral rightness of segre-|
and the sense of guilt grow-
“out of the conflict between
democratic creed and his racist prac-
tice.”

Interestingly enough, there was in
Dr. Hodges’ comments only one ref-
erence to constitutional rights. Does |
this indicate that he believes no}
constitutional question to be in-|
volved other than the rights of the |
Southern Negro?

If so—and if the problem was root-
ed in some psycho-religious conflict |
of the racist Southerner—then his |
argument will have both credibility |
and cogency for the naive, the un-
suspecting.

But we suggest that Southern mo- |
tives are more pointedly focused on
something Dr. Hodges overlooked
the constitutional rights, not only of
James Meredith, but also of the
State of Mississippi.

We suggest noting: 1) that
regulation and administration — of
education is a state function, since
“not delegated to the United States
by the Constitution, nor prohibited
by it to the States” (Amendment X);
2) thus the exercise of federal jur-
isdiction in Mississippi can be consti-
tutionally justified only by the
“equal protection” clause of Amend- |
ment XIV; 3) an amendment which, |
while the Supreme Court has ev: aded |
passing on the legality of the issue, |
was ratified, at bayonet point, by |

300 Alumni
To Return

Washington and _ Lee’s
Openings Dance Set begins to-
day with the Zeta Beta Tau
Cocktail Party given in honor
of Openings President Tom
Supak, at the Mayflower, from
4-6 p.m. The Del Vikings,
known for such hits as ‘“Whis-
perin’ Bells’ and “Come Go
With Me,” will provide en-
tertainment, and a grain punch
will be served.

The Vice-Presidents of Openings
are: Syd Butler, SAE ,in charge
of the figure; Brice Gamber, DTD,
miscellaneous; Barry Greene, ZBT,
cocktail party chairman; Alen
Holilomon, Phi Gam, decorations
chairman; Jon Supak, ZBT, pub-

Gymnasium from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. on
Friday. Dress is formal for stu-
dents and their dates. The theme
will be a “Peppermint Lounge Twist
Party,” with appropriate decorations.

An experienced performer who

*has been on the best-seller list for
| ten years, McPhatter is a _ style-
setter with his vocal tricks and ef-
fortless upper register. Formerly a
key figure in the Dominoes and the
Drifters, well known groups, he has
been on his own since his release
from the Army in 1956. He has many
hits to his credit, including “Little

“Honey Love,’ and “Treasure of
Love.”
The candidates for Homecoming

Queen will be presented during the
intermission. Dr. Keith Shillington

will announce and crown the Queen.

A Pat On

The Back

Dance Board President Frank Young has been waving a
magic wand in Doremus Gym, transforming the basketball
court into a suitable dance floor. Young is to be congratulated
on the superior quality of entertainment lined up and de-
serves a pat on the back for rallying the enthusiasm of the
student body to almost unanimous participation.

Tom Supak, a ZBT junior, has served as a fine Openings
Dance president. We should extend our full support to him

and his vice-presidents.

Welcome Alumni

An estimated 300 alumni will be returning this weekend
to converge on Lexington’s busiest weekend since the 1960
Mock Convention. They certainly should not find any lack of
excitement or entertainment. The “Shrine of the South” is
being hit not only by the Homecoming -Openings festivities of
We&L, but also with Parents’ Day and a home football game
at VMI. For the next two days, Lexington will be one maze of
trafic jams and swarming crowds.

To the adventurous alumni who are brave enough to show
up, the University extends a hearty welcome, and our felicita-
tions on surviving the chaos of the weekend.

 

Dance Weekend Centers
On ‘Twist Party’ Theme

By FRANK YOUNG
Friday Columnist

Tonight at 9 p.m. in Doremus Gym-
nasium marks the debut of the
_ 1962-63 University
Dance Board sea-
son. Clyde Mc-
Phatter and his
15-piece rock and
roll orchestra will
| supply the enter-
> tainment for the
9 to 1 formal
dance which will
be set to the
: theme of a “Pep-
oung permint Lounge
. Twist Party.”
The doors to the gymnasium will
open at 8:30 p.m., and McPhatter
will be on stage at 9 p.m. sharp.
Openings President Tom Supak, his
vice-presidents, and the Dance Board
Advisory Council will be prestened
at 10 p.m. Following the Openings
figure, McPhatter and his orchestra
will again perform until the 11 p.m.
intermission, at which time the 17
fraternity Homecoming Queen dele-
gates and their escorts will bow to
the student body.

Clyde McPhatter is no newcomer
to the rock and roll scene. Sky-
rocketing to fame early in 1955,
the tenor singer has remained an
outstanding performer throughout
his career. He is particularly re-
membered for such gold record-
ings as “Lover Please,” “The
Treasure of Love,” and “Ta Ta.”
The versatility which McPhatter
and his orchestra display lends it-
self perfectly to a college dance,
as the group is capable of playing
practically any type of dance
music.

Doremus Gymnasium will again be
the setting for the Saturday night
rock and roll concert from 8 to
10. The entertainment for this func-
tion will be supplied by three of
the outstanding popular recording
artists in the country today in the
persons of the Shirelles, the Coast-
ers, and King Curtis. Students are
requested to be in the gym and
seated by 8 p.m. Curtis and his
group will be performing instru-
mentally from 7:30 to 8 as_ the
students enter the gymnasium.

Originally from Plainsfield, New
Jersey, the Shirelles have been the
dominant female singing group in
the country since 1959. Their lengthy
list of hits includes such numbers

with Curtis for the past year and
have recently cut an album with
him entitled “The Shirelles and

Curtis is remembered in his own
right for “The Soul Twist” and
“Beach Party.”

The Coasters, who will open the
Saturday night concert, are also one
of the outstanding rock and roll
groups in the nation. Appearing at
8 p.m., the group will be singing

such numbers as “Searching,”
“Along Came Jones,” and “Poison
Ivy.”

Letters
To The

The ‘'13” Club Strikes

Office of the Editor
Ring-tum Phi
Dear Sir:

I am writing as a member emeri-
tus of “13” in reply to Mr. Lane’s
brilliant editorial comment and
masterpiece, which recently appear-
ed about our organization in the
paper. Mr. Lane, you present your-
self as being quite well informed
as to what we stand for and what
we are for and against. I speak
as a member in saying that you as
a non-member are quite uninformed.
We are for thirteen days of noise
betwen classes on the colonade, for
being “secret” and for being com-
rades in little more than this. We
are against the ass who yearly
lowers himself to devoting space in
the Ring-tum Phi to assailing us.

Thank you for your article and
your opposition. We have each justi-
fied the other’s existence for an-
other year.

Humbly submitted,
RALPH C. WIEGANDT

 

Collegian Delayed
By Late Ads

Dear Sir,

Due to circumstances far beyond
the control of the editorial or busi-
ness staff, the Southern Collegian
will not appear this weekend. The
very efficient ad printers employed
by the Collegian in New York who
run off the national ads have once
again “booted the ball.”

Since the cover ads have not ar-
rived, we are unable to distribute
the magazine.

The Collegian will probably appear
Nov. 10 when W&L plays Sewanee
at home.

Thank you for your patience and
have one ---- of a weekend.

New Science Facilities
To Be On Display For Alumni

Washington and Lee Uni-
versity alumni returning for
homecoming festivities this
weekend will get the first pub-
lic look at the university’s new
$1,252,000 science facilities.

The new four-story building for
physics and biology and the reno-
vated existing science building will
undergo alumni inspection Saturday
morning. Although the facilities were
placed in use when classes began
in mid-September, contractors have
not yet completed finishing touches
to the buildings.

Alumni throughout the country
contributed funds for the science
facilities during a two-year de-
velopment campaign conducted
by Washington and Lee from 1959
to 1961.

For the second consecutive year,| |
homecoming activities and the tra-| |
ditional opening dance set coincide. | |
Although homecoming does not get! !

underway officially until Saturday’s
9 am. registration, alumni, their
wives and guests have been invited
to dance to the music of Clyde
McPhatter and his orchestra begin-

ning at 9 p.m. Friday in Doremus| |

Gymnasium. The Coasters, the Shi-
relles and King Curtis and his group
will entertain at a “rock ’n roll”
concert Saturday at 8 p.m. in the
gymnasium.

Among the top events of the week-
end will be the 2 p.m. football
game between Washington and Lee’s
Generals and Johns Hopkins’ Blue
Jays. When Johns Hopkins last met
Washington and Lee on Wilson Field
in 1960, the match ended in an
8-8 tie. This game proved to be the
only blot on the Generals’ record
in 21 games—a streak that ended
Oct. 6 in a 38-33 loss to Emory &
Henry.

 

Washington and Lee will face

Old Dominion College of Norfolk
in cross-country beginning at 2:45 |
p.m. Saturday.

Washington and Lee President and |
Mrs. Fred C. Cole will honor re-|
turning alumni at a 10:30 a.m. cof-
fee Saturday at the President’s
home. A noon luncheon in Evans
Dining Hall and a post-game recep-

 

 

tion are also on the schedule.

The homecoming queen—select-
ed from candidates submitted by
the university’s 18 social fraterni-
ties—will be presented for the first
time at Friday’s formal dance. She
also will be presented during the
halftime ceremonies at the foot-
ball game.

The 12-man Alumni Board of
| Trustees—governing body of Wash-
ington and Lee’s Alumni Associa-
tion—will meet at 2:30 Friday. Rod-
ney M. Cook, a 1946 graduate from
Atlanta, is current president of the
Alumni Association Fund Council, a
six-man group that directs the an-

nual Alumni Fund Campaign.

B.V. Offers “Broadening Horizons”
To Students Seeking Diversion

By SANDY FENN

Once in a while everyone should
get out of Lexington, if only for
__a few short hours.
; It clears your
head, it sharpens
your. senses, it
broadens your in-
tellectual horizon,
it tempers’ the
fiber of your ex-
- istence. When you
return, you will
have a new sense
of well being and
oneness with the
world. I urge that
you all go to Washington and listen
to the National Symphony or go to
New York and see a good Broadway
play. Or...do as I did last Sunday
afternoon... go to B.V. to see Hatari.

There I was away from the rou-
tine of life at W&L. There I was

   

Fenn

seeing something of the world. There |
I was paying ten cents less to see the | |

unexpurgated version of a flic in
glorious, wide-screen technicolor
than I would have to pay to see
the expurgated version in Lexington.

As I walked down the aisle, the
sound of rock and roll music
reahced my ears. It reminded me
vaguely of a combo we once had
which was so bad that we paid
them to leave halfway through the
evening. We gently explained to
them that we had an epidemic of
Mongolian Jungle Rot sweeping
through the house that weekend.

I sat down and let my eyes ad-
just to the darkness. There they
were off in the darkest corners,
squinting through the gloom with
beady, white eyes and exchanging
furtive kisses. Ah, to be young
again...and in love!

I shifted slightly in my seat as
the Foghorn Leghorn cartoon flash-
ed across the screen. I became so
intrigued by the cartoon’s allegorical
depth that I scarcely noticed the

 

 

two men in sleeveless, oderiferous T

shirts... that is until they sat down
beside me.
Popcorn

They were munching popcorn
and arguing about the presence
of God in Red China today. Their
basic theory was that Mao Tse-
tung was having the same rotten
breaks with the weather that
the Pharaoh ran into when he
wouldn't let the Children of Is-
rael out of slavery. They went on
to compare Chiang Kai-shek to
Moses, as an emancipated leader

Two W&L Injuries
For Homecomings

By NICK MONSARRATT
Asst. Sports Editor

Homecoming will be warm for
Washington and Lee’s football team
this Saturday but injuries may put
a damper on the Generals’ running
attack when they meet Johns Hop-
kins.

Halfback Henry Sackett, who
was vying for state high scoring
honors with Earl Hawkins of Em-
ory and Henry, is still a question
mark in the starting line-up. He
suffered a sprained ankle in last
week’s 18-13 win over Randolph-
Macon and it has failed to re-
spond to treatment. Sophomore
Skip Chase has been named by
Coach Lee McLaughlin as Sack-
ett’s replacement.

Senior guard Mickey Walker will
be out for his second week

Emory and Henry game. Junior Bill
Gossman will replace Walker on the
blue unit.

The man to watch for the Blue
Jays is 160 pound quarterback
Gerry Pfeifer, who appears to be
heading for a Johns Hopkins total
offense record. In the Blue Jay’s
three games he has averaged 180
yards, which would bring his total
to 1,440 in their season of eight
games, 262 yards more than the
1958 record.

Pfeifer may be expected to pass
a great deal, and with his favorite
receiver John Cox at 6’ 3” the
Generals could see some trouble.

Washington and Lee’s fullback,
Tommy Keesee, who will provide
the Generals’ land power as he
hopes to better his 164 yards on
the ground in last week’s game
against Randolph-Macon, Stu Yof-
fe will also seek to meet the
Blue Jays’ passing threat by re-

as al
result of a leg injury received in the |

peating his hard ground game of
last week.

Johns Hopkins will come to Lex-
ington with a 2-1 record, as they
beat both Franklin and Marshall and
Haverford decisively, and lost to
Ursinus 20-12.

The Blue Jays’ starting left end,
Mike Hobbs, is the brother of last
year’s captain of the Washington
and Lee undefeated team.

 

Pagano Named
Star Of Week

Co-captain Bob Pagano has been
cited by the Washington and Lee
. soccer coaching
staff as this week’s
most outstanding
performer for his
inspired play in
the Generals’ 3-1
upset over Lynch-
burg College.

The talented
center forward
didn’t hit the
scoring column
against Lynch-
burg but was in-
strumental in W&L’s attack through-
out the game. However, he did
pick up an assist for the first Gen-
eral score.

Coach Lyles calls Pagano the
“iron man” and the “set up man”
of Washington and Lee’s forward
line as he has been an outstanding
factor in every game this season.

Lyles went on to say that Pagano
is the type of ball player who “gives
that 110 per cent effort, always
putting out more than expected.”

Pagano has only one goal this

Soccer Team Upsets Lynchburg

Teamwork Cited
As Deciding Factor

By DICK KREITLER
Staff Reporter
The Washington and Lee soccer
team defeated Lynchburg College
for the first time in seven years on
Wednesday by a decisive 3-1 score.

The Generals got ofl to a quick
start as mid-way through the first
period Tim Henry scored from
right-inside assisted by Bob Pa-
gano to give the Generals a 1-0
lead,

Steve Hibbard kept the scoring
going for Washington and Lee by
putting one past the Lynchburg
goalie for a comfortable 2-0 margin.

Lynchburg came back toward
the end of the third quarter with
Jim Stokes scoring on a _ kick-in
to cut down the General lead.

Washington and Lee wasn’t
through scoring until Jim Mell
placed one into the nets from fif-
teen yards out.

Tom Green, the W&L_ goal-
tender, was one of the key factors
in the team’s victory by saving
fourteen Lynchburg shots.

The forward line’s attack was
led by surefooted Bob Pagano and
Steve Hibbard who were most in-
strumental in controlling the play
for the Generals.

At left halfback Bruce Jackson
turned in an exceptionally fine per-
formance even though he was han-
dicapped by an injury for most of
the game.

Tom Clements, in the center half-
back slot turned in his finest defen-
sive performance of the season.

Coach Lyles was more pleased
with this win than any other since
he began coaching here, four years
ago. He said that the Generals dis-
played the best teamwork that he
has ever seen in a college soccer
game.

Lyles went on to say that “this
was the best soccer game played
at W&L in years.”

This Friday the booters will face
a tough test when they meet Duke
University in Durham. They will be
seeking to better their 4-1 season
record.

Reflections of Telstar

Remember the picture above? It flashed across your
television screen on a hot night last July. Perhaps
you remember that it originated from France. And
that it reached the U.S. via Telstar, the world’s first
private enterprise communications satellite.

Since that summer night, the Bell System’s Telstar
has relayed electronic signals of many types —tele-
vision broadcasts, telephone calls, news photographs,
and others.

But there’s one Telstar reflection you might have
missed. Look into the faces of the Bell System people
below and you'll see it. It is the reflection of Telstar’s

success that glowed brightly on the faces of all wh
shared in the project. eg

Their engineering, administrative and operations
skills created Telstar and are bringing its benefits’
down out of the clouds to your living room.

These Bell System people, through their talented,
dedicated efforts, make your phone service still better,
more economical, and more useful.

The reflections of Telstar are many.

Debaters
Take Ist,
2 Awards

By STEVE SMITH
News Editor
Washington and Lee’s de-
bate team won first place and
brought home two _ trophies
from its first tournament of
the year, the Old Dominion

Invitational in Norfolk last week-
end.

Bill Noell and Al Eckes won the
two-man division with a 5 and 1
record, Noell also winning the Per-
suasive Speaking contest. Out of 13
schools entered, including Navy,
Maryland, South Carolina, and
America, W&L was the only team
to earn more than one first place
prize.

Appear on Television

While they were in Norfolk, Noell
and Eckes filmed a TV _ debate
against the tournament host, Old
Dominion College. The question for
the television show was the national
collegiate debate topic: Resolved,
that the non-communist nations of
the world should establish an eco-
nomic community.

The film, which was shown Sun-
day and will be shown again tomor-
row was not judged for a decision,
but viewers of WAVY-TV have
been asked to write to the station
as judges of the debate.

Strength Against Strength

The tournament’s six rounds of
debate were arranged by the
“strength against strength” method,
so that a winning team met only
other winning teams and the los-
ing schools were in turn paired to-
gether. This type of tournament is
most difficult to win, because the
competition becomes progressively
stiffer, until, theoretically, the two
top teams face each other in the
finals.

Noell and Eckes, debating affirm-
ative and negative sides of the ques-
tion alternately, were thrown against
South Carolina in their final round.
Against USC, a perennial debate

 

power which consistently is repre-
sented in the national champion-
ships, W&L piled up enough points
to win by the narrowest margin.

Noell won the speaking contest
with a speech on “Beliefs.” It was
the third time that he has won the
speaking trophy. Eckes placed third)
in After-Dinner Speaking with a
humorous talk on “What the Civil
War Means to a Yankee.”

Discuss Tournament Experience

Last night the entire debate team
met to analyze in discussion the
principle arguments which were en-
countered in the weekend meet.

forensics, announced .that he is in

To Committees

By SHANNON JUNG

The Executive Committee an-
nounced today the appointment of
six new student body committeemen,
including the appointment of a
freshman to a committee for the
first time .

These appointments were made
available because of vacancies exist-
ing on the committees. Only the
freshman appointment is completely
unprecedented.

Bob Vaughan, Phi Gam from
Petersburgh, Va., is the first fresh-
man to be placed on the Assimilation
Committee or any other university
committee.

Bill Noell

Assimilation Committee Chairman
Bill Noell has long advocated the
placement of a freshman on _ his
committee. The move is being made
to broaden the plane of student rep-
resentation in the hope of increased
cooperation from the freshman class.

Steve Smith, newly appointed
Student Library Committeeman, is a
Sigma Nu from Jacksonville, Fla.
News Editor of the Ring-tum Phi
and publicity director of the Debate
Team, Smith is also a Washington
Scholar and a Varsity debater.

President of the sophomore class
Malcolm Morris has been appointed
a member of the Cold Check Com-
mittee. Morris, a Sig Ep from Rich-
mond, is Phi Eta Sigma, publicity
director of the Glee Club, varsity de-
bater, and Ring-tum Phi reporter.

Jim Maffiit

Jim Maffit, freshman dorm coun-
selor, has been named an Assimilia-
tion Committeeman. A PiKA from
Raleigh, N. C., Maffit works on the
Calyx, is a member of the Young
Republicans, a fraternity officer, and
was Freshman Camp Counselor.

Appointed to the University Com-
mittee of Intercollegiate Athletics
were Tommy Keesee and Robert
Lathrop.

Keesee, W&L first string fullback,
is co-captain of this year’s football
team and has been named Virginia

' back of the Week. Keesee is an SAE

from Memphis, Tenn.

Lathrop, a Delt from Baltimore,
Md., is an assistant soccer coach.
A member of the freshman law
class, he was captain of the soccer

Frosh Granted Clemency;

Meanwhile, concerning actual
shipping which may be moving to-
ward Cuba, the U.S. Navy is watch-
ing a Soviet vessel believed to be
rigged to carry guided missles. But
President Kennedy still has to issue
the formal order putting the quaran-
tine into effect. No American war-
ships are authorized to actually stop
foreign vessels moving toward Cuba,
despite what Kennedy said last night.

U.S. Ships are at sea around Cuba,
but the State Department says that
it is considering giving Cuba and
the Soviet Union a period of grace
before our ships actually begin halt-
ing and searching vessels.

All military leaves have been
cancelled by Russia for her own
officers, and she has warned the
U.S. she will not permit her Cuba-
bound ships to be searched for of-
fensive weapons. Observers in Mos-
cow believe that Russia has taken
a moderate line in its reply, how-
ever, even though some harsh words
have been used in the statements.

These observers were more im-
pressed by what was not in the
Soviet statement than by what was
in it. For example, the Russians have
made no mention of Berlin, nor have
they begun to amass any troops, nor
have they convoyed their supply
ships to Cuba in order to call Ken-
nedy’s hand.

A Word On ‘Mergers’

Openings is over, and all-in-all it must be judged a suc-
cess as dance weekends go. Board President Frank Young and
Set President Tom Supak are to be congratulated on a well-
planned and, with the exception of a couple of unavoidable
complications, well-executed concert and dance.

The fraternities showed unusual energy and originality in
their Homecoming displays, and the football victory put every-
body in a partying mood. Seemingly, the innovations of no
combos during University-sponsored activities detracted little
from the success of the weekend.

One aspect of this year’s Openings, however, we question
as a worthwhile contribution to party weekends; that is the
trend—begun a few years ago and increasing in popularity

with each big weekend—toward
to hire top ranking combos.

The reasoning seems to be that if two houses go together,
they can bring in the best possible dance groups for a reason-
able amount of money, while if they hire combos singly the

fraternities would be paying

quality of entertainment. The growing tendency to go in for
these party partnerships is evidenced by the fact that six houses
in three groups of two had the Del Vikings, the Coasters, and

the Shirelles Saturday night.

As far as we could see, each

less than successful. It is true that the entertainers were ex-
ceptionally good—when they could be heard. Most of the time
it seemed to us the three houses where the parties were held
were bursting with more than capacity crowds; too much smoke
made breathing almost impossible, and too much conversation
drowned out all but occasional spurts of music.

Obviously, “closing” the combos doesn’t do any good, for
all three of the double parties this weekend were supposed to be
closed. And even if it were possible to restrict attendance to
two fraternities, 75 or 80 people with dates are more than can
comfortably be accommodated by any house on campus.

We are not suggesting that inter-fraternity mixing isn’t
good; only that the trend toward big-name combos under two-

house sponsorship is producing

necessary kind of social gathering at W&L.

Conservative Society
‘Works for Freedom’

By JIM DeYOUNG

One of the most increasingly sig-
nificant forces on the American col-
lege scene is a move toward po-
litical conservatism.

Back in 1960, Conservatism really
found its impetus on the college
campus with the formation of the
Young Americans for Freedom
(Y.A.F.) at Sharron, Connecticut.
later that

It was only a year

W&sL’s conservative society joined

the fast-growing movement with a
charter membership of fifteen peo-
ple.

Late last spring the Society
switched from Y.A.F., which was
solely a political action group (they
are the power behind conserva-
tism in New York state) to the Inter-
collegiate Society of Individuals
(1S.I.) which is dedicated to the
education of students in the ideals
of conservatism.

Non-Partisan

ILS.1. is a tax-exempt group and
is non-partisan in politics. They can-
not engage in any political action,
but are allowed to express their
opinions on such things as govern-
mentally controlled medicine versus
privately controlled medicine with-
out showing partisanship.

The membership in IS.I. num-
bers 15,000 presently and there are
around 45,000 past college graduates
that were members at one time.

The LS.I. also finances both con-
servative society speakers heard on
our campus and the Southern Con-
servative newspaper. The organiza-
tion sponsors these two things free
of charge because of W&L’s affilia-
tion with the program.

Run on Donations

Where does the I.S.I. get its mon-
ey? Contributions from individuals
and foundations make up the only
source of the LS.I.’s income. Young
men not too many years out of col-
lege head the organizaztion.

The LSI. also runs a summer
school for two weks, free of charge,
for students in schools that are af-
filiated with the organization. Last
summer they used the Southern
Conservative paper as an example
of the “quality and type of publica-
tion” desired by the LS.I. Eventually,
they hope to branch out into a larger
session so as to give college credits
for their courses.

The Society's Purpose

What exactly is the purpose of the
Southern Conservative Society on
our campus?

According to President Wyatt
Durrette, “We came together with
two purposes in mind: 1) education
and 2) dissemination. ...We are

 

against any force of tyranny over

the minds of men and are dedicated |

to the defeat of, not ‘co-existence’
with, international communism.”

Durrette went on to say that the
conservatives were fighting
preserve the freedom in the few
areas where it truly exists, and to
“return the freedom to areas that
have been deprived of it.” the con-
servative society feels that in order
to be free one “has to show re-
sponsibility” and this responsibility
is to be found with the local levels
of government rather than with the
federal government.

To Educate the People
They feel that if they can edu-

to} -

cate people in the conservative ideal, | *

in the principles of economics and
philosophy, and inculcate a strong
moral fiber, the individual man
will be able to stand on his own

two feet and make his own decisions. | .

They believe this is a most import-
ant goal for all mankind, and are
doing their part to further accom-
plishment in this field.

With these goals in mind the So-
ciety had several speakers on the
campus last year.

Among them were Robert Golds-
boro, former investigator for the
House un-American Activities Com-
mittee, and Col. Robert Weaver,
former Chief of the Army Psycho-
logical Warfare School. Two movies,
“Operation Abolition” and “Com-
munist Encirclement—1961” were al-
so shown.

Dr. Russell Kirk

Dr. Russell Kirk spoke earlier this
year on the “Essence of Academic
Freedom.” The Society is trying to
get, later this year, Erik vonKueh-
nelt-Leddihn, a political theorist
from Austria, author of Liberty and
Equality, a study of democracy and
classical liberalism, in addition to an
unfriendly examination of Naziism.

The Socety is also seeking out
Stan Evans, one of the leading fig-
ures in the college age conserva-
tism revival and author of the book
Revolt on the Campus, a study in
the history of conservatism on col-
lege campuses.

Professor Anthony Bouscaren also
may come as a speaker. He is the
author of Soviet Foreign Policy:
Pattern of Persistence.

Both Bouscaren’s and Evan’s books
will be given to the library later
this week by the LS.I. along with
Up From Liberalism by William

| Buckley and Our Nation’s Water Re-

sources—Policies and Politics by
Ben Moreell.

The Southern Conservative So-
ciety feels that they have profited
from a year’s experience and as a
result have already expanded their
activities for this year.

Their goals are set; they are work-
ing hard to attain them.

Homecomings Weekend In Review:

Combo Parties And Missin

By ROGER PAINE
Managing Editor
Tuesday Edition

Kleenex from homecomings dec-
orations is caught in hedges all over
Lexington, bottles of aspirins have
been emptied, the Delacardos have
gone back to North Carolina, and
Openings Weekend is done once
again.

It was an unusual weekend. Two
of the big attractions were not able
to perform—Clyde McPhatter’s man-
ager didn’t know what had happened
to his charge; the Coasters were so
blasted they couldn’t have led them-
selves out of a burning building.

All in all, however, the weekend
was a great success. The frequency
of party weekends has been cut
down from year to year, and the
difficulty of the academic curricu-
lum has been stepped up.

Days of Deserved Nirvana

The result is an ever-present need
to forget books and take to the bot-
tle and a date for a couple of days
of deserved nirvana. After allowing
this need to build up for three
straight weeks, there was no possible
way for openings Weekend to fail.

The weekend started off with the
judging of Homecomings decora-
tions, and the ZBT’s won it, follow-
ed closely by the Kappa Sig’s, the
Lambda Chi’s, and the Phi Delts, in
that order. The difference in judg-
ing came with those decorations
which were planned for display in
both daylight and at night.

If some sound-effeets had been
furnished, this was a count in that
house’s favor also. A number of
houses were eliminated from the
running due to the fact that some
of the judges were ladies, and sev-

 

eral decorations were, to say the |
least, unfit for a respectable tady's
perusal.

The Beta’s Bird |

The truck drivers were getting al
big kick out of driving by the |
Beta house Friday afternoon. |

The cocktail party was crowded, |
ill-ventilated, and the sound system |
was inadequate. This is typical for |
the basement of the Mayflower. |
More space is available at the}
Moose Lodge, which is available for |
rental, and the band could be seen |
better there. Future cocktail party |
chairmen should learn one thing)
from this last one, though, and that |
is that a reliable loud speaking |
system should be seen to as the
most important factor in any such|
affair.

Then, a few hundred Egyptian fan- |
wavers should be imported to pro-|
vide the necessary ventilation for
the room in a town which has not
yet heard about air conditioning.

McPhatter’s Mistake

Friday night, when it became ob-
vious that Clyde McPhatter had not
been able to find Lexington (indeed,
his band stayed an hour and a half
at the Mary Baldwin gymnasium
thinking it was at W&L), the Little
Boys and the Del Vikings were
thrown into the breach.

The Faculty Committee on Fra-
ternities’ decision to cut out com-
bos during University functions hurt
badly on this night, although it is
very probable that nothing like this
will happen again. Once every
few years there is a breach of con-
tract, and in dealing with rock-
and-roll personalities the chances
of a contract break are increased
ten-fold.

 

 

Happy Alumni and a Winning Team

The football team responded ad-
mirably to the slogans which the
fraternities had adopted in their dis-
plays, and on Saturday afternoon
made the alumni happy. The week-
end couldn’t have been better as
far as weather was concerned, and
so everyone was happy and ready
for the concert Saturday night.

It need not be said that King Cur-
tis was great, which he was, or
that the Shirelles were entertain-
ing, which they were.

The fact that they didn’t know

| the words to a couple of their most

famous past hits gave everyone an
indication that they may not have

| scored too high on their college
| boards.

Make-Shift Concert
At any rate, the Delacardos took
over for the Coasters, and did a
good job of it. They had come over
to the gym to watch the show, and

| Fronk Young asked them to do a

15-minute show themselves.

They had ten minutes to run back
out to their station-wagon, pick up
instruments, put on dress-coats, and
get on stage. After a couple of be-
ginning numbers, Chris, their lead
singer, started screaming “Ooh Poo
Pah Doo” and the concert was a
success again.

Big Name Combos

Combo parties after the concert
are history now—most of them prob-
ably lived up to expectations. There
were a lot of big names on campus,
so that anyone coming to W&L from
another school would have wonder-
ed where all the money was coming
from. But fraterinties had teamed
up to pay the rather prohibitive

 

prices, thus cutting down the cost}

g Singers

per individual fraternity to a very
reasonable sum.

One mark of the weekend—quite a
few closed parties—was a change
from the past. Perhaps the old era
of wide-open parties at W&L is
finally dying out. It would be too
bad.

Sunday afternoon there was a
closed party at the Moose Lodge—
closed, that is, to all houses except
the Phi Gam’s, Phi Delt’s, SAE’s,
Delt’s KA’s, Phi Psi’s, and Betas.
It represented the traditional tying
up of the weekend, and it was done
very well.

The Delacardos performed for it,
the standard of behavior could be
described as a sort of bleary-eyed
sophistication, and the party was a
great success.

By this time, cars were leaving
Lexington, taking girls back, and
restaurants were full of students on
their way home from various Vir-
ginia towns after leaving their dates
at respective schools, homes, or bus
stations.

Looking Ahead: Fancy Dress

Frank Young should be highly
congratulated for his weekend, as
should Tom Supak. As for the at-
tractions who didn’t show up, as
Frank said, you can only do so
much. After you’ve signed the con-
tract, gotten the deal cemented, and
made a couple of reassuring phone
calls to the manager right before
the weekend you can only sit back
and count on them to arrive. When
they don’t, there’s really nothing to
be done but take back your de-
posit and look to Fancy Dress.

And that’s precisely what we're
doing now—looking to Fancy Dress.

‘Silent Service’ Is Keynote
Of The UCA’s Activities

By BILL SUPON

Perhaps the most taken-for-
granted organization on the W&L
campus is the University Christian
Association.

The average student would have
a hard time telling exactly what it
is and what it does, apart from the
more obvious things like the annual
Christmas service, and last year’s
campaign to get Martin Luther King
to speak here. Other than these,
very few people could say anything
about the UCA.

Grew Out of YMCA

Actually, this lack of publicity has
been part of the UCA since it began
years ago as part of the YMCA, on
up to the present day. As President
Ashley Wiltshire says, “We're not a
prestige organization like the 13
club—we have united to try to build
a fuller life for ourselves and the
University. Action is what counts.”

This “fuller life” is realized in
two ways: intellectually and in com-
munity service.

In the intellectual line, the group
sponsors a series of seminars in re-
ligion each year, featuring well-
known speakers from around the na-
tion, This year there will be three
such seminars, one with Hobart
Mowry, head of the Department
of Psychology of the University of
Illinois, discussing “Modern Con-
cepts of Man.”

Religion Down the Road

Also related to the intellectual
side of things is the monthly meet-
ing at which a professor speaks on
a topic of interest. These meetings
are usually in seminar form with
free discussion on the matter at
hand.

“In adition, we send a group of
boys to Hollins, Randolph-Macon,

 

and Sweet Briar once a month to
meet with some of their girls—for a
theological discussion, of course,”
says Dr. Hodges, advisor to the
group.

The community service projects
include the Boy’s Club, possibly the
best known of these. Some of the
members go to the local junior high
school and direct about fifty boys in
football and similar activities.

Welfare Workers

The UCA also contributes its part
to Kennedy liberalism by assisting
in passing out government surplus
food to people on relief once a
month.

Allied to this is the Mountain Mis-
sion Program, in which students go
to small country churches in the
area to teach classes and assist in
Sunday services.

What about plans for the future?
“Well, we'd like to send the UCA
president to Union Theological Sem-
inary each summer for their train-
ing program,” says Wiltshire.

As for long-range plans, the UCA
would like to have some form of
services for the student body—“the
chapel is a museum, not a place to
worship. There just isn’t any place
for worship. We want to do some-
thing about it.”

The Purpose of the UCA

The UCA also wants more discus-
sion groups. Too often, classes in
the University only touch on the
ideas involved in religion and theol-
ogy. In Wiltshire’s words, “We would
like for the student to realize that
there are principles underlying
them—important principles which
one must grasp sometime in_ his
life. I guess this is the purpose of
the UCA.”

‘Help Free General Walker’

“Friends of General Walker” have
sent a poster to the Ring-tum Phi
office entitled in two-inch bold face
capital letters, “PROTECT YOUR

WALKER.”

On the poster is a re-print of an
editorial from the Dallas Morning
News by Robert Morris giving warn-
ings of Communist infiltration, Con-

stitutional dissolution, and federal
infringement on civil rights.

After an appeal to Americans to
protect their rights, the editorial
ends, and fades into a huge headline
urging “SEND YOUR CHECK OR

LAY.”

And, as an after thought, the pos-
ter adds “Make checks payable to

Rumor has it that Luther Hodges,

The same rumor has it that Sar-

Generals Chug Past Johns Hopkins For Fourth Win

Blue Jay Mistakes Help
W&L Roll To 22-8 Victory

Washington and Lee, sputtering like a rusty old locomotive,
received a couple of timely nudges from Johns Hopkins and
chugged to a 22-8 homecoming win Saturday.

 

x <. Course

Attraction

The cross-country team thought
the weekend over when it trudged
out to practice Monday. Little did
it know of the events to come. As
the team ran the course backwards
it came upon a remarkable find—a
boy and girl entwined in the middle
of the cross-country path.

Fast runners raced to circle back
for another look. Slow runners went
slower and slower. And Tom Stov-
er, a wrestler getting some early
workout, failed to complete the
course. Coach Dick Miller was very
excited by the report and may run
with the team from now on.

For future information come out
and run with the cross-country
team this week.

If comparative scores mean any-
thing, Washington and Lee better
be well prepared for Sewanee Nov.
10.

The Tigers, who gave the Generals
one of their toughest games last
year, walloped Randolph-Macon
Saturday, 30-8.

Everyone, of course, remembers
that the Generals only squeaked by
the Yellow Jackets, 18-13.

Southwestern also continued its
winning string by boping George-
town, Kentucky, 14-7.

Centre, however, bowed to De-
pauw, 30-6.

Southwestern still leads the Col-
lege Athletic Conference with a 1-0
record, but Sewanee should join
them after meeting Centre this
weekend.

Defense Weak

Hopkins, following the precedent
set by Emory and Henry and Ran-
dolph-Macon, pushed through the
W&L defense at will, but a fumble,
an intercepted pass by Dan Flour-
noy, and W&L’s defensive stand of
the day thwarted the Blue Jays’
three serious scoring threats.

Fullback Tommy Keesee, and half-
backs Stu Yoffe and Skip Chase,

no one matched Keesee’s or Yoffe’s
impressive performance against Ran-
dolph-Macon.

Butler, Norman Return

Red team fullback Syd Butler and
halfback John Norman showed some
of their old zip after returning from
injuries, reeling off 22 and 12 yards
respectively.

The Generals, relying as usual on
their “powerful” ground game, man-
aged only 47 more yards than Hop-
kins, 184 to 137. The total offense
was even closer with W&L leading,
228 to 203.

After failing to move the ball in
its first series, W&L received a
gift-wrapped scoring opportunity
with 12:20 left in the first period.

Blocked Punt

Johns Hopkins’ center, Joe Hahn
hiked the football over punter Neale
Smith’s head into the end zone.
Smith retrieved the ball, but W&L
tackle Jim Sylvester deflected
Smith’s punt and quarterback A. J.
Barranco fell on the loose football at
the Hopkins 14.

Yoffe and Chase carred to the
seven. Keesee plunged to the one-
foot line and hurdled over on the
next play. Chase turned right end
for the two-point conversion.

team, 17-38.

41 mile course in a time of
25:15. Washington and Lee’s top
runner, Mike Shank, challenged
Green for two and a half miles be-
fore developing side pains.

Andy Kilpatrick, a sophomore star
of the harriers, took over the num-
ber one position for Washington and
Lee, but could manage only a fourth
place in the meet against the tough
Old Dominion runners.

Freshman Riff O’Connor and soph-
omore Bob Patton finished second
and third for Washington and Lee
(seventh and eight in the meet)
followed by Scott Kennedy and
Rick Rogers.

The Generals’ cross-country squad
now holds a 3-2 record and will meet
Franklin and Marshall here this
Saturday.

The Diplomats were one of the two
teams which defeated the Generals
last year.

really meaningful? More than just personally

DIVIDED OPINION SHOWN IN CUBA POLL

R. E. Lee Research Grants Are Announced

Program Termed As
‘Unique Opportunity

By JULIAN MARKHAM
Assistant Managing Editor
The Robert E. Lee Scholars and Research Assistants for
the current academic year were announced today by Dr. W.
W. Pusey, Dean of the College. Under the Robert E. Lee
Research Program for Undergraduates, the Scholars and Re-
search Assistants will receive grants-in-aid financed by an

alumnus for this purpose.

In its third year of operation, the Robert E. Lee Research

Program is being received with
students alike. This is due in part,*
Dean Pusey said, because of the
wide range of projects available in
the fields of science, language, the
humanities, and the social sciences.

Cited as one of the many “forward
looking aspects of Washington and
Lee,” Dean Pusey said that a pro-
gram of this type of research is
“quite rare on undergraduate cam-
puses” since it gives students the
opportunity to begin academic re-
search with mature scholars. “The
Robert E. Lee Research Program is
one of which Washington and Lee
is very proud.” The continuence of
this program is guaranteed by the
funds made available in the endow-
ment, Dean Pusey noted.

The Robert E. Lee Scholars and
Research Assistants and the pro-
fessors (in bold face type) under
whom they will work are noted

This change in policy came about
because the percentage of students
who had taken the shots was low.

The U.S. Public Health Service
has announced that there is a high
probability of an outbreak of Asian
flu this winter. This flu is highly
contagious and could cripple a stu-
dent body unless precautionary
shots are taken. The serum offered
is highly effective and there is lit-
tle chance of reaction to it.

Mrs. Agnor, the head nurse in
the infirmary, said that there would
be two nurses on duty every week
night from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. for the
next few weeks.

It is advisable to take these in-
jections as early as possible because
it will take three weeks for full
immunization, and the _ greatest
chance of epidemic will begin after
students return from Thanksgiving
vacation.

Troubs To Begin
New Fall Season
Next Wednesday

By C. C. FLIPPEN

Executive Editor

Shall the dogma of the ma-
jority rule man’s mind or shall
it be free to seek out truth on
its own?

This is the central theme of
the play, “Inherit the Wind,”
which will open next week at

the Troubadour Theatre.

The drama, based on the famous
Scopes’ monkey trial held early
this century, is not history; it is
rather a piece of theatre. It is a
drama of suspense which only takes
the incident of the monkey trial
as its basis.

Man’s Rights

“The play concerns the necessity
of a man being allowed to speak
what he believes,” Dr. Cecil Jones,
director of the play, said. “More
than this it envolves his right to
think, to ask questions—even about
subjects generally considered to be
beyond question.

“The matter of teaching evolu-
tion, simply the subject itself,
is not important here,” he said.
“But what is important is whether
a man has the right to think for
himself—whether he can weight
evidence and make up his mind, or
if he must blindly accept what
the majority believes.”

Actual history was envolved in
shaping the play slightly. The trial
itself has been rearranged and con-
densed.

Main Characters

The four main characters in the
original trial, Clarence Darrow, Wil-
liam Jennings Bryan, H. L. Menken,
and Scopes, find their counterparts
in the play. However, the fictional
characters, Henry Drummond, Mat-
thew Brady, E. K. Hornbeck, and
Cates, take only shadings of the his-
torical figures. All other characters
in the play were created for the
drama.

The play itself is in a sense, “one of
suspense,” Dr. Jones said. “Although
the outcome is known, as the play
progresses it is not quite so obvi-
ous as it may have seemed in the
beginning.

Suspenseful Drama
“Like any drama based on a trial,
its suspense mounts in the moving
from witness to witness,” said.

The leading roles in the play,
by Jerome Lawrence and Robert
E. Lee, are held by Tim Morton
as Drummond, Gay Reading as
Brady and John Dunnell as Horn-
beck.

The play will be presented Wed-
nesday-Saturday of the
Curtain time each performance
is 8:30 p.m.

ter of influence.

But its action the United States
has put before it an immediate pos-
sibility of complete destruction by
nuclear war. As far as determin-
ing future action it has already
been decided or will be by the Rus-
sians; we have already committed
ourselves. What remains to be done
is to find out what the people feel
about the crisis we have entered,
and the Ring-tum Phi has conse-
quently decided to poll a reaction of
the students and faculty at Wash-
ington and Lee.

Three Questions

1) There are rumors that Kennedy
precipitated this action for its vote-
getting possibilities. Is there any
truth to this?

2) Do you think that our action
stemmed more from our violated
rights in the matter or from being
confronted with a previously unex-
perienced situation?

3) Do you think there is a pos-
sibility of a limited war in Cuba
if an agreement is not reached?

Dr. Leon Sensabaugh, Professor of
History and an expert on Latin Ameri-
ca, offered the following answers:

On question one; “Although Ken-
nedy is a very able politician, I can’t
| quite see that he acted on these mo-
ties.”

On question two: “Self-protection
|is a fundamental right of any coun-
| try, and Kennedy acted on the basis of
national security. As long as actions
and weapons in Cuba were defensive
the Administration wasn’t too worried.
But when offensive weapons were built
the proximity of Cuba took on a new
aspect.”

On question three: “Yes (there is a
possibility); not necessarily a land
war, but naval action is quite possible.
(But) the only chance of limited land
action would be if Castro in some
way attacked us.

Mr. Futch, a new member of the fac-
ulty in the Department of History was
asked his opinion on the crisis. He stat-
ed in answer to question one:

“These rumors may very well have
some foundation in fact. Politicians
are politicians.”

On question two: “The circumstances
mentioned in Question three, as well
as Pentagon pressure on the White
House, seems the likeliest explanation
for the U.S. action on Cuba.”

Dave Montgomery, a senior Delta
Tau Delta, enthusiastically offered his
opinion.

“Although this was a convenient
time for JFK to come out with his
position, I think he has more integrity
than to put the USS. in a crisis position
for political reasons. Anyway, if the

blockade fails, he has cut his own
neck in 64.”

His answer to question two: “Our
action stemmed from our violated

rights when it became clear that Rus-
| sia wasn’t willing to listen to words
and correct the situation.”

 

In response to question three: “No,
1 think there will either be an all-out
|nuclear war or a continuation of the
| cold war— nothing in between.”

Jim Haley, a junior
tive in the

and quite ac-
Conservative Society,
|emphatically voiced his beliefs on
| the present situation by saying in
answer to question one: “(this is)
| absolutely true! It was known in
Congress and among the military

A Greeting To Parents

This weekend promises to be a busy one with more than
1,000 parents planning to attend the Eighth Annual Parents’
Weekend. Activities are planned for all day Friday and Satur-
day, all of which will give the parents a better idea of the school

and its activities.

The Office of University Relations and Dr. John Wise,
chairman of the Parents’ Weekend Committee, have done a
fine job in making the arrangements and planning the well-
rounded program of events. The response of the parents to
the weekend proves their interest in the school and its objec-
tives. Each year the number of interested parents multiplies and
perhaps in future years full attendance will become a reality.

We welcome all of the parents to Washington and Lee this
weekend and hope they have an interesting and pleasant time.

 

Cuban Crisis Creates

New Look

By HARRY MEEM
Friday Reporter

As this is written, the United
States quarantine of Cuba is slightly
over three days old. Our naval
vessels have permitted one Soviet
tanker to pass on the captain’s as-
surances that he had only petro-
leum for cargo, one freighter has
been stopped and is being inspected,
and a report from Washington indi-
cates that another Soviet ship has
been allowed to proceed. And the
world is still here.

The United Nations is in a flurry
of activity, in an attempt to prevent
war. Peace offers are flying thick
and fast, with Acting Secretary-
General U Thant trying to establish
negotiations in an attempt to re-
solve the crisis.

President Kennedy made a tough
speech to the Nation Monday night,
and it was necessary that he do
so. The Communist “salami” tactic,
of taking a bit of territory at a
time, could not have reigned un-
checked forever, without eventually
undermining all the United States
stands for. The President had to
prove that the United States is not
afraid to fight, that it can and will
take stern measures to prevent the
spread of Soviet conquest.

The first Soviet reply was filled
with the sort of propaganda to
which we are by now well accus-
tomed. Words are cheap, and the
Soviet Union used them in abun-
dance. Some of them are almost
funny in light of Soviet actions
in the past.

One passage from Khrushchev’s
reply to Britain’s Lord Russell, who
appealed to both heads of state to
call off their actions, seems espe-
cially ludicrous. Premier Khrushchev
wrote: “It is well known that if one
tries to mollify a robber by giv-
ing him first one’s purse, then one’s
coat, etc., the robber will not be-
come more merciful, will not stop
robbing. On the contrary, he will
become increasingly insolent. There-
fore, it is necessary to curb the
highway man....” Mr. Khrushchev
may have meant his words to apply
to the United States, but they are a
perfect description of Soviet actions
in the past, and the present U. 5.
positions.

Now Mr. Khushchev is trying to

Debate Stress
Now On Frosh

Mr. William W. Chaffin, director of
forensics, has announced that for
the next three weeks there will be
an emphasis on freshman debating
while the varsity takes a short rest.

After practice debates during the
week, Mr. Chaffin and both a nega-
tive and affirmative team will set
out on Friday for Wake Forest.
They will debate there against an-
other frosh team. The following
weekend, Nov. 8-11, two completely
different freshmen teams will travel
with Mr. Chaffin for a similar round
at the University of South Carolina.
During this time the varsity will
be preparing for the Tau Kappa
Alpha debating tournament to be
held here the weekend of the 16th-
18th.

After Thanksgiving there are pos-
sibilities of debates at Temple Col-
lege, N.C.U., and New York City.
Mr. Chaffin is optimistic about the
varsity teams’ chances in these
meets.

Freshmen are reminded that there
will be a mock debate similar to
that at freshman camp for parents

 

Friday at 8 pm. in the duPont
lecture room. The topic is—Resolved:

Civil War.

appear magnanimous by offering to
hold up shipping to Cuba for the
three weeks asked by U Thant. Our
reply, that the blockade stays, may
seem to put us in a bad light. To
some nations abroad, it will seem
we are bent on a path of aggression
and have no wish to stop, no matter
what our opponents do.

Our main purpose in establishing
the quarantine was not to strangle
Cuba, but to force the removal of
the missile sites already established
there and prevent their being re-
established.

If Mr. Khrushchev wants peace,
this is what he should offer, not
merely to suspend shipping and go
into negotiations.

Mr. Khrushchev seems to be run-
ning somewhat scared already. He
has diverted some of the ships
bound for Cuba, and jumped for
negotiations as quickly as they were
offered.

The Soviet Union has no vital in-
terests in Cuba, and would find it
difficult to supply in case of war,
lying as it does 4,000 miles from
Russia. The Soviet Union must have
some clear-headed men who can
see that the risk of war merely to
maintain an irritant in the Western
Hemisphere is not worth it.

Both sides now have agreed to

preliminary talks. Both sides need aj @

way to back down from the threat
of a nuclear war without losing
face. And it is almost certain to be

nuclear, no matter what the pro-| =

testations from the two powers.

We are now, and will for some
time be, in a position of watching
and waiting, while the powers ne-
gotiate. This is all we can do, wait
and hope. We have had to do this
in the past, with no assurance that
the talking going on was going to
lead to anything. With the show of
force by the United States, it at
least seems likely this time that
some definite action will be taken.

News Editor

Mr. James Boatwright, Washing-
ton and Lee instructor of English,
returned Wednesday from the first
National Poetry Festival in Wash-
ington, D.C., at the Library of
Congress.

Many of our major poets were
present as speakers, chairmen of
discussion groups, and as readers of
their own poetry. The festival was
in line with the present administra-
tion’s patronage of the arts. It also
commemorated what Mr. Boawright
calls “the most important event in
American poetry—the founding of
Poetry magazine.” He adds, “Look-
ing back over the last fifty years,
we can see the tremendous effect of
Poetry, which has published most
of our major poets before they be-
came famous.”

Theme

The theme of the event was “Fifty
Years of American Poetry.” In line
with this, the program included,
besides the 35 or so outstanding
poets present, many other writers—
mainly poets who have recorded
their works on tape for the Library
of Congress—and other individuals
who have contributed to the de-
velopment of poetic expression in
this country.

Topics

Topies included: “The Role of the
Poetry Journal,” “Fifty Years of
American Poetry,” “The Poet and
the Public,’ and “The Problem of
Form.” The age of the poets varied
from thirty to that of Robert Frost,
with poets such as John Crowe

Ransom, Karl Shapiro, Mark Van
Doren, Robert Penn Warren, Ken-
neth Rexroth, Richard Eberhart,
Henry Rago, Louis Untermeyer, and
others being present. The Beat poets
were not represented; Mr. Boat-
wright did not know whether this
was due to their not being asked or
their refusal to come.

Festival

Although this the first Festival
devoted to poetry that the Library
of Congress has held, The Library
has held 12 such festivals for cam-
ber music since 1925 and has been
the scene of many individual poetry
and literary programs in the last
quarter century.

The proceedings of the sessions
have been recorded and will be
published by the Library in book
form during 1963. The festival was
the first ever to be sponsored by
an agency of the United States
Government. It was financed by a
grant of funds from the Bollongen
Foundation of New York City.

Mr. Boatwright, who left Sunday
to attend the frstival as Editor of
Shenandoah, thought the spirit of

‘Southern Conservative’ Aims
At States’ Rights, Lower Debt

The Conservative Society, which
has many supporters in the ranks
of southern conservative Democrats,
is a student organization widespread
throughout this country. The main
arm of the Conservative Society of
W&L is its monthly paper, the
Southern Conservative. After suc-
cessful operations last year, under
the leadership of Bob Sykes, the
Southern Conservative plans to ex-
pand.

The basie policy of the organiza-
tion is to further knowledge and be-
lief in the basic Conservative Doc-
trine through intense, deliberate, and
academic articles. Recognizing ex-
tremes on either left or right is
potentially dangerous. The South-
ern Conservative follows the policy
of recognizing only rational argu-
ments.

The organization has some basic
ideas pertinent to an understanding
of their Doctrine. They believe in
the preservation of a republican
federal system of government func-
tioning on the basis of the separa-
tion of powers concept, as set up by
the Constitution of the United States.
They advocate a more positive for-
eign policy aimed at ultimate vic-
tory rather than mere containment.
They see the necessity of curtailing
the billowing power of the federal
government. They believe that an
end should be put to government
deficit spending which inflates the
value of the dollar.

Along with this they would like

to see a tempering of the welfare of
state concept in order to maintain
individualism and incentive among
the American people. They declare
above all that faith must be instilled
in Americans in those principles and
concepts which were so dear to our
forefathers and for which a count-
less number of Americans sacrificed
their lives.

With these broad principles in
mind the Southern Conservative will
comment upon contemporary events
and actions as well as expounding
upon the social, economic, and phil-
osophic bases of Conservatism. The
Conservative Society plans to dis-
cuss this thoroughly by having guest
columns from such leading expon-
ents of Conservatism as Representa-

paper is to link Conservative So-
cieties within the South. Communi-
cations have already been set up
with Davidson, Sweet Briar, Ran-
dolph-Macon, as well as UVa., Wil-
liam and Mary, and Hampden-
Sydney. A column has been and
will continue to be devoted to the
Conservative Societies of other cam-
puses .

Conservatives feel that Conser-
vatism is a greatly growing force
particularly among college students
in the United States, and their ef-
fect will be heard in the future in
response to a past generation of
extremely liberal government.

This year there will be a nominal
fee charged for the paper. This will
not include students, to whom dis-

 

the event was summed up by Stan-
ley Kunitz, one of the opening
speakers. “Kunitz sees the Poet as
the representative free man of our
time. While other men work in
gangs and packs, and produce in
bits and pieces, the writer—especially
the Poet— has his freedom.”
Commenting on the festival it-
self, Boatwright added: “It is a re-

Since the present senior class en-
tered Washington and Lee in 1959,
many _ significant
changes have
taken place which
have _ influenced
all phases of stu-
dent activity.
These changes
have been initia-
ted by both the
students and the
faculty, and have
provided a _ pro-
gressive and im-
proving trend for

 

Hart

this university.

The class of ’63 was the first class
to eat in the Commons. This was
one of the biggest changes the fra-
ternity system had faced in many
years. Not having the freshmen eat-
ing at the houses proved at first to
be a financial problem and a prob-
lem of assimilation of the freshmen
into the fraternity. These problems,
however, seem to have been over-
come, and this change is apparently
proving successful.

Changes in student government
include an increase of importance of
the IFC and the newly formed Stu-
dent Control Committee. The IFC
has indeed changed in its import-
ance on campus. Faculty action has
necessitated the IFC’s realization of
its capabilities not as an opposing
force to changes instigated by the
faculty, but as a means of coordina-
tion so that these changes might
prove successful for all concerned.
The formation of the Student Con-
trol Committee has placed new au-
thority in the hands of the students,
and this committee thus far has
proved quite successful. Its disci-
plinary actions have gained it the
respect of the student body, and as
a result it seems to have lessened
misconduct on the part of the stu-
dents.

The recent action of the faculty
on combo parties during university
dance functions will undoubtedly
increase attendance at the dances
and concerts. Yet the present in-
crease in the sale of dance plans
is not attributable to this action.
Improved and more active dance
board leadership and a more popular
entertainment program have caused
a tremendous increase in the sale
of dance plans since 1959. This type
of change in social life is a good one
for the university as a whole, and
those responsible are to be con-
gratulated.

Improved Facilities

The improved dormitory facilities,
the new science building and re-
modeling of Howe Hall, and the
renovation of Lee Chapel are all
physical changes which have great-
ly improved the appearance and
usefulness of our campus. The most
traditional-minded students and
alumni may perhaps be a little hes-
itant to approve a type of expansion
at W&L, yet this most recent ex-
pansion was very much needed, and
is one that all students and alumni
should be proud of.

With this idea of change being
so prevalent on our campus, I
think it particularly important that
the students not forget the many

 

Four Year’s Of Change
Is Witnessed By Sentors

when we consider change in stu-
dent life at Washington and Lee.

Since our freshman year (1959-
1960), there seems to have been a
decline in observance of some of
our traditions. The speaking tradi-
tion, particularly, seems to have lost
its significance. I think every stu-
dent needs to be reminded that we
do observe such a tradition, and it
is this tradition, along with con-
ventional dress, the freshman beanie,
and the honor system, that we can-
not change and still expect W&L to
remain the fine university that it
is.

Change, then, in student govern-
ment, social life, and physical fa-
cilities is fine for a progressive uni-
versity. But as a word of caution,
let's not be so anxious for change
that we forget those things which
make our University what it is today.

UCA Expands

Church Work

The University Christian Associa-
tion is expanding its program into
community church services.

 

The Mountain Missions Depart-
ment of the UCA is participating
in missions and churches in rural
areas outside Lexington. This work
includes teaching Sunday School
or taking over the complete Sunday
service.

Curently, two missions and a
church are benefiting under this
program. Phi Kap’s George Spauld-
and Ed Fitzgerald, freshman, have
assumed charge of the Clark Moun-
tain Mission, several miles outside
of town. They are conducting the
Sunday program for the entire mis-
sion,

Phi Delts Pete Weimer, senior,
and Ken Lane, junior, are teaching
the Men’s Bible Class at Popular
Hills Presbyterian Church. They are
conducting a class of about 25 mem-
bers.

Mac Brownlee, junior, is assisting
with classes at the House Mountain
Mission.

The UCA announced that positions
in several other churches are open
for any interested students. Those
wishing to participate should see
the chairman of Mountain Missions,
Tommy Edwards.

a winning season Saturday when
the Generals play host to a Frank-
lin and Marshall eleven that is still
looking for its first win of the year.

The Generals, now 4-1 for the sea-
son, need one more victory to as-
sure themselves of a better than
.500 season for the third consecu-
tive year. They were unbeaten in
1960 and 1961, after turning in a
3-4-1 season in 1959.

On hand for Saturday’s contest
will be some 1,000 parents of Wash-
ington and Lee students, attending

the University’s eighth annual Par-

ents’ Weekend.

Potentially Dangerous

Despite the Diplomats’ unimpres-
sive 0-4 record, Coach Lee Mc-
Laughlin rates F&M as a potentially
dangerous opponent. He says the
Dips are “a lot stronger” than last
season when the Generals won at
Lancaster, Pa., 40-0. “They certainly
have more speed than last year, but
they lack depth,” he adds.

Top offensive threat for F&M is
halfback Mike Reese, a former
quarterback for the Diplomats. For
that matter, all of F&M’s starting
backs are former quarterbacks, a
big shift by Coach Woody Sponaugle
which is designed to put more punch
in an offense that netted only 35
points in 1961.

Big F&M Line

The biggest worry for the Gen-
erals is the beefy Diplomat forward
wall. Says McLaughlin, “We didn’t
run against that line last year, and
we won't be able to go through it
this time. We’re going to have to
brush up on our pass patterns and
work on our outside game.”

Franklin and Marshall and the
Generals have shared one mutual
opponent. The Dips lost to Johns
Hopkins by a 28-7 score, while
the Generals shot down the Blue
Jays Saturday by a 22-8 count.

McLaughlin was pleased with the
Generals’ win, but he allowed as
how “it wasn’t a really overall con-
sistent effort.”

“Hopkins certainly didn’t quit on
us at any time, and they could
have,” he said. “They deserve a lot
of credit.”

McLaughlin Praises

McLaughlin passed out praise for
the “big boys” of the W&L line—
blue team tackles Bobby Payne and
Jimmy Sylvester and red unit line-
backer Dan Flournoy—for their
fine play against Johns Hopkins.
Fullback Tommy Keesee played his
usual “steady game,” said Mc-

Laughlin. He singled out sophomore |

Football Tvi-Captain Bob Payne

Named Athlete Of The Week

Senior tackle Bob Payne has been
cited as “athlete of the week” by
the Washington and Lee coaching
staff for his outstanding play against
Johns Hopkins.

Payne displayed exceptional of-
fensive in the first half
of the contest
with the Blue
Jays, putting forth
what the coaches
called a “100 per
fe cent effort’ in
carrying out his
blocking assign-
ments.

In_ the
half Bob showed
the Homecoming
crowd one of the
best defensive

prowess

second

 

 

performances of the season. Coach
Mac mentioned that in viewing films
of the game, it became obvious that
Payne’s defensive work was out-
standing and vital to the Generals’
victory.

McLaughlin also noted that on a
pre-game written test of scouting
reports, Bob scored a 98 to lead
the team, displaying his knowledge
of the opposition’s moves. Mc-
Laughlin cited this as another ex-
ample of Payne’s conscientiousness
toward football this season.

Bob has proved himself a fine
leader throughout the season, and
has done a highly creditable job
as tri-captain in helping lead the
Generals to their current 4-1 rec-
ord.

the president’s move was based on
the nature of weapons installed in
Cuba being changed to offensive.
His move was primarily motivated
by our national security, not the
uniqueness of the situation.

COLD WAR FORECAST: CONTINUED TENSION

By Dr. MILTON COLVIN
Asso. Professor of Political Science

There is something about the con-|
tinuing International Crisis that re-|
minds one of the book entitled
“Growing Up Absurd.”

Mr. Khrushchev says that Russia
will dismantle her rockets and re-

turn them to the Soviet Union;
Castro demands that the United
States give up the Guantanamo
naval base.

Brazil suggests that Africa and
South America be declared “off-

limits” or “out of bounds” to atomic
war and adds that neither conti-
nent should be allowed to make
atomic bombs, and all of this in the
face of common knowledge that no

 

country in Africa or Latin America
has ever made a bomb or is ever
likely to.

At home base in Washington Mr.
Arthur Sylvester, Asst. Sec. of De-
fense for Information, is limiting his
comments to phrases that would
shame a ten year old and possibly
put him back from third to second
grade. And the Democrats and Re-
publicans squabble over who is most
responsible for the victory that has
not exactly been won yet.

Nor is nonsense limited to the
Cuban affair. Across the otherside
of the world China with a popula-
tion it cannot feed of about 700
million is involved in oneupmanship
of casualty claims against India
with a population of 400 million

 

which it cannot feed. Meantime

stock prices are going back up on|

the New York Stock Exchange.
Crisis Over?

But is the fever and the crisis
over? Has Krushchev really re-
formed and are we really back from
the brink and on the highroad to|
peace and disarmament? Not quite
and not yet, I would suggest.

True, a victory of sorts has been
won in that we didn’t go to war.
Indeed, this is the main point. More-
over, we have the Soviet pledge
to get their offensive weapons—
“grim weapons” as Khrushchev calls
them—out of Cuba and thus out of
our backyard.

But we have promised no invasion

 

in return which sounds like a qual-| Berlin where the real showdown was| easily cut and the city itself is 100

ified guarantee of the survival of}
the Castro regime. And the block- |
ade is to go.

So Mr. Castro and his cutthroats
are seemingly to be allowed their
mischief-making forays into the po-|
litical life of our Latin American
friends providing it is done by|
stealth and not by rockets and pro-
viding that no overt action is taken |
by Cubans against Guantanamo.

Mr. Khrushchev has backed down |
but he has done so in the honorable |
name of “world peace” and _ this
will not fall entirely on deaf ears.
The capacity of some “neutrals” to
be deceived is almost unlimited.

Berlin

I think the scene now shifts to

in the first place. In his most recent |
note Premier Khrushchev stresses |

| the need for “regulation of relations

between the NATO nations and the|
nations of the Warsaw Pact.” He|
offers the hope of a detente.

After all, the United States held)
the better hand in Cuba. American
naval strength was overwhelming.
Limited was out of the question. It
is to the Soviet advantage to trans-
fer the up and coming crisis to a
place where the high cards will be
with them. This is Berlin.

Within East Germany the Soviets
have between 24 and 27 Armored
Divisions plus whatever bobtail di-
visions the East German Army can
offer. Access routes into Berlin are

 

miles inside communist controlled
territory.

A show of strength there would be
a Red show of strength and limited
war would be a Soviet victory. What
we shall shortly see, I think, is
strategy superceding tactics and it
is with strategy and NOT tactics that
the final game is won.

Mr. Khrushchev still subseribes to
the idea that “he who controls Ger-
many controls Europe, and he who
controls Europe controls Eurasia,
and he who controls Eurasia gets the
world.” We in America must take
care that we are not outmanuevered
in Germany by concentrating too
much on Castro.

Library
Regulations
Announced

Chairman of the Student Library
Committee Randy Cole made three
policy announcements of major im-
portance this week to users of Mc-
Cormick Library and the Commerce

Library.
His first statement: “Cases in-
volving intentional, wrongful re-

moval of books or any other prop-
erty from the library will be re-
ported to the Executive Committee
for investigation as a possible vio-
lation of the Honor System.”
Second: “Excessive noise, hiding,
or mutilation of books will be dealt
with by the Student Library Com-
mittee and will be subject to fine
upon review.”
Honor System Violation
Finally: Removal of any material
from the Commerce Library will be

considered a breach of the Honor
System.”
Cole said that signs to the ef-

fect of his statements will be placed
in the libraries within week. A
box will be in the library for any
problems to be pointed out to the

a

 

committee and for the report of
violation of regulations.

He emphasized the third statement
because it has not been general |
knowledge in the past. Now, he said, |
the committee is going out of its way |
to ensure that all students realize |
the seriousness of removal of ma- |
terial from the Commerce Library |
and the consequences which will fol-
low.

Enforcement Provided

To enfore the ruling on excessive |
noise, Cole said that members of |
the Library Committee will be in|
the library for observation at var-|
ious times.
The Committee will fine students |
who remove books wrongfully but |
unintentionally, including locked re- |
serve cases, from two to fifty dollars.
Fines in the case of mutilation, |
noise, or hiding will be at the dis-|
cretion of the committee, but will|
depend on individual cases. Recur- |
ring offenders will be dealt with|

severely.

Cole said that his committee is
acting under the authority of the
Executive Committee, which re-|
viewed the announcements before
they were made public.

The Library Committee meets!

weekly on Thursday nights in the
Student Union. In addition to Cole,
the body consists of Jon Supak, sec- |
retary; Steve Parel, Al Eckes, John |
Graham, Walter Bennett, and Steve |
Smith.

percentages of production per cow
in its area. Figures on the herd’s
degree of contentedness were mo-
mentarily unavailable.

Tim Morton, Gay Reading Hold
» "* Lead Parts In ‘Inherit The Wind’

By LARRY MEEKS

The first of two dress rehearsals
of the Troubadour play, Inherit the |

Wind, was held last night at the|
Troubadour Theater. The drama,
based on the famous Scopes’ mon- |

key trial of Hillsboro, Tennessee, |
was written by Jerome Lawrence |
and Robert E. Lee, and is being}
directed by Dr. Cecil Jones, assist- |
ant professor of Fine Arts and fac-|
ulty director of the Troubadours.

The leading roles in the play are}
being played by Gay Reading and}
Tim Morton. Gay Reading plays the}
part of Brady, whose historical |
counterpart is William Jennings|
Bryan. Reading is a sophomore, and |
this is his second appearance with
the Troubs. His first was the part of
Gratian in Shakespeare's Othello. In |
the play Brady is the lawyer for
the prosecution in Hillsboro, and he |
is determined to uphold the teach- |
ings of the Bible against the Theory |
of Evolution.

Drummond, the lawyer for the
defense, is played by Tim Morton
and finds his historical counterpart |
in Clarence Darrow. Darrow is up-|
holding the right of teacher to
teach evolution but is not necessarily
defending the theory.

15 Pledges Save House From Collapse
By STEVE SMITH

The Phi Epsilon Pi house has apparently saved itself from

certain collapse this year by successfully rushing gentile stu-

dents. At this writing the PEP’s have 15 pledges, only three of

whom are Jewish.

At the end of Rush Week the PEP’s listed only two pledges

and appeared to be heading for

extinction. But they decided to

VMI Plans
Dress Parade
For WGL

The Virginia Military Institute
Cadet Corps will honor the Wash-
ington and Lee student body with
a full dresss military parade this
Thursday. Si Bunting, captain of
the cadet corps at VMI, stated that
a review of troops would be held
in honor of W&L.

The entire W&L student body is
invited to attend the cadet review-
ing of the troops. The review is
being held on Thursday, November
1, at 4:15 at the VMI parade grounds.

As an effort to show W&L men a
phase of the military student’s life,
this invitation is being made _ to

strengthen the relationship between ,
VMI and W&L. This idea of staging |
a military parade originated with

Regimental First Captain Si Bunting,
cadet corps commander.

The VMI corps is to be reviewed
by the VMI heads of staff, with the
top W&L ROTC cadet officers. Sam
Bloch, Battalion Commander, heads
the representative group from the
university.

Bunting stated that he felt that,
“something is needed to improve the
relationship between the two schools.

and have now picked up six sopho-
mores, nine freshmen, and four so-
cial members.

For years a “Gentlemen's Agree-
ment” had permitted the two Jewish
houses the assurance that no Jewish
freshmen would be pledged by the
other 16 houses. In return neither
the PEP’s nor the ZBT’s rushed
gentile freshmen.

Now an open rush seems to be in
the offing next year. Actually the
seeming “closed rush” system had
not been complete—two years ago
the president of the PEP house was
a gentile. However, the fraternity
had not technically rushed him; he
depledged from another house, be-
came a social member of the PEP
house, and subsequently an active.

Randy Cole, ZBT president, said
that his fraternity will join in an
open rush next year. He expressed
reservations, however, as to the
number of men the ZBT’s would
rush; used to a virtual monopoly
on a good group of freshmen, the
house may take its time about
entering into full competition with
other houses.

During this year’s Rush, the
ZBT’s sent observers to the other
fraternities to become familiar with
more competitive rushing. This move
apparently was made under the as-
sumption that the PEP’s would leave
campus and that the ZBT’s would
be forced into open rush in fairness
to Jewish freshmen. Now open rush
has developed in a very different
framework.

The pledges of the rejuvenated
PEP house are Bill Surbaugh, Brax-
ton Tabb, Eric Hanson, Kline Bolton,
Bob Brooks, Bill Supon, Jim Boch,
John Anderson, Ken Bernhardt, Tim
Carpenter, Herb Mitchell, Bill Can-
non, Bob Hudson, George Meier,

VMI Dress Review

As far as we can tell, relations between W&L students and
VMI cadets have never been particularly good. Perhaps the
only area where the two student bodies ever found a common
denominator was in athletics, and the rivalry that existed there
was wiped out with the advent of Purity at Washington and
Lee. Since that time, the relationship between students of each
school has simply been one of tolerance.

For this reason, we are pleased to learn that VMI’s student
government is sponsoring a full dress inspection and review
in honor of Washington and Lee. The purpose of the ceremony
is to promote improved relations by demonstrating the spirit of
VMI. We think the idea is excellent, and that VMI’s initiative
is commendable.

The ceremony itself will be impressive, but even more im-
pressive is the fact that it will be in honor of Washington and
Lee. We hope the student body will show its appreciation by
attending.

Dissnia’ : Wein

The Eighth Annual Parents’ Weekend is over, and from
all indications must be adjudged a success. More than the
anticipated 1,000 parents attended, and most of them seemed
duly impressed with their sons’ collegiate environment.

The Office of University relations and Dr. John Wise,
chairman of the Parents Weekend Committee, are to be con-
gratulated on a well organized and executed program.

Perhaps the only factor detracting from the success of
the weekend was the inadequate amount of quartering space in
Lexington for the parents.

This was due to the conflicting dance weekend and Home-
coming at VMI which naturally drew a large number of par-
ents and alumni to town.

Perhaps in the future an effort will be made to plan major
weekends of the two schools on separate dates, so as to avoid
overcrowded motels and restaurants.

Executive Committee Functions
As Co-ordinator Of Student Life

By TRACY HARRINGTON

In a generation of radicalism and
change for change’s sake, the W&L |
campus has much the same atmos- |
phere that prevailed here 30 or 40
years ago.

The traditions of conventional
dress, and speaking, the Honor Sys-
tem, and the freedom of student
self-government have endured.

Largely responsible for keeping
Washington and Lee’s singularly
unique atmosphere from deteriorat-
ing is the Executive Committee
the nucleus of student life at W&L.

Everybody knows that the EC en-
forces and governs applications of
the Honor System. But what about
its other functions?

| of concern, the EC holds the purse

strings to the student activities fee

and the student body fund, which

amounts to approximately $20,000.
The Four Committees

Although the four committees—
Assimilation, Cold Check, Student
Library, and Student Control—func-
tion as separate organs of student
government, they are all ultimately
under the supervision of the EC.

In addition, the EC chooses all
the members of the four committees,
and can—should they deem it neces-
sary by a two-thirds vote—reverse
any decision of the Publications
Board and Dance Board.

Student membership of the Uni-
versity Committee on Intercollegiate
Athletics is selected by the EC, as
Washington and Lee’s_ repre-
sentatives to Who’s Who in Ameri-
can Colleges and Universities.

The EC’s primary function, of
course, is to enforce the Honor
System. It decides on just what areas
are covered by the system, as well
as what are to be considered “fringe

Reds Analyzed
By FBI Official
In New Book

By JOHN KIRKLEY

What is the appeal of Communism?
This is an important question dis- |
cussed in J. Edgar Hoover’s new}
book, A Study of Communism.

We in America are at least par-}|
tially aware of the gross dichotomy |
of Soviet ends and means. We see |
“brutality, thought control, oppres-
sion, and human degradation where |
communism promised _ liberation,
justice” and an ideal society. We|
see communists promising peace and
acting to incite aggression.

We also know of the failure of
Soviet economic hopes: Russia and
China are simply not producing
enough food and material goods to
adequately meet the needs of their
people. For these reasons it is dif- |
ficult to see why

individuals can |
become seriously interested in com- |
munism.

But we are sheltered in many}
ways from the appeal of commun-|
ism. Communism is not socially ac-
ceptible in America. Our education
enables us to see the great disparity
between Soviet means and ends. Our
material wealth makes us less sus-
ceptable to the economic offers of
commusism. Our comfort renders us
numb to offers of a better way of
life.

But to the ignorant, the hungry,
the oppressed communism comes as
a seducer of the mind. Commun-
ism is a beast clothed in glowing
garments and with a smiling face.
It offers food, clothing, shelter, se-
curity, happiness, relief from pain.

Hoover mentions four major at-
tractions of communism. The first
economic. Communism offers poor
people material goods through the
communal efforts of the (future)
world state. Sociological advantages
appear to all those who are in any
way disturbed at existing social in-
equalities or frustrated in attempts
to bring about social reform through
legitimate means.

Communism attracts new nations
through providing hope of political
advantage. As evidence for their
case, they point to the Soviet Union
as a going concern and attribute all
its advances and its present status
in the world to communism. To
idealists seeking a quick remedy to
political ills, communism seems to
provide a means to utopia.

The fourth attraction, which is
very strong and appeals chiefly to
individuals, is the psychological at-
traction. To the insecure it offers a
tangible goal, a certainty: “Com-
munism will triumph.” For the weak,
unable to bear responsibility ,it of-
fers a retreat: one can lose himself
in the party, achieve a sense of per-
sonal accomplishment in the suc-
cess of the group. For those with a
“will power” it offers a means of |
controlling others. For the undi-
rected it provides a cause to which |
they can dedicate their lives; in |
serving communism, they think they |
serve humanity and contribute to
the inevitable course of history. |
Every man becomes a hero; each is
necessary to the forward march of
the faith. This undoubtedly is a
strong appeal and one which is hard
to combat.

Washington and Lee’s Glee Club harmonizes during its initial performance of the school
year last Saturday as a Parents’ Weekend feature.

Washington & Lee’s Glee Club
Works Hard To Attain Success

By JIM De YOUNG

Last Saturday night marked the
first public appearance this year
of Washington and Lee’s Glee Club
and the John A. Graham Brass
Choir.

Most people thought it was an out-
standing concert. Sam  Channell,
president of the Glee Club, said
Saturday night’s performance was
the best in years. “The sound was
excellent, the tone and quality was
good, and all the voices blended
well together.”

Channell did say that the club
had difficulty in the use of their mu-
sic, and that the music sheets were
an obvious hindrance in the club’s
rendition of With a Voice of Sing-
ing, where the club had trouble with
the different entrances in the song.
He also said, though, that the mem-
bers would no longer use their
music in performances, which he
thinks will lead to greater expression
to the club.

Versatility

This year the chief characteristic
of the club, once again appears to
be versatility. The 60-man group has

 

twenty new freshmen who have all

had experience and who are showing
great potential so far this year, ac-
cording to Glee Club Director Robert
Stewart .

He added that these freshmen,
combined with several of the four-
year men and soloists in the club,
including Dave Spencer, manager of
the group, John Baker, Phil Booth,
Sam Channell, Jim Mell, and Bob
Aylin have done an outstanding job
for the Glee Club this year as have
the other members who have sacri-
ficed their time to make W&L’s
glee club even a better organization
than in past years.

Recording Released

Earlier this year the club re-
leased their first recording. The
record includes such songs as Broth-
ers Sing Out, two choruses from The
Messiah and several old college
favorites. This record may be pur-
chased in the University Co-op.

What does the Glee Club have
planned for this year?

As usual, the club will perform
concerts through the Central and
Eastern part of the United States.

Once again the highlight of the

 

season will be a spring concert tour

which will include performances in
Atlanta, Georgia, and Wilmington,
Delaware.

On November 8th, the club is
scheduled to sing in Clifton Forge
and perform with the Brass Choir
as a part of the Community Con-
cert Series there.

To Sing With Baldwin

More than a week later the club
will combine with the Mary Baldwin
choir in presenting a Sunday after-
noon concert in Staunton.

Two of the selections that will be
sung are Te Deum Laudamus com-
posed by J. Haydn and Fantasia on
the ‘Old 104th’ Psalm Tune composed
by R. Vaughan Williams for piano
solo, orchestra, organ, and chorus.

In the joint concert, Dr. James
Leyburn will play the piano and a
thirty piece orchestra will perform.

There will also be the traditional
candlelight service in the R. E. Lee
Memorial Church before Christmas
vacation.

Washington and Lee’s Glee Club
has worked hard in the past to pro-
vide good entertainment, and this
year’s organization promises to do
even more as an accomplished group
of performers.

 

Debate Team
As Highlight

staged last Friday was the Parents’
Weekend highlight. The evidence is
conclusive; the parents enjoyed tre-
mendously the debate presented by
two teams of W&L’s champion de-
baters Friday night.

Resolving that the South should
have won the Civil War, a pair of
Southerners, Jay Clark and Bill
Noell, patriotically argued the af-
firmative. Supporting the negative
stand, Bill Boardman and Al Eckes,
both Yankees, took the opposing |
view.

Showing that this military victory |
would have forced the South to in-|

union of the two sections into a

After cross-examination on_ his

Eckes proposed a myth of his own.
Using E. D. Adams as an authority,

quered both the North and _the|
South separately.

Jay Clark, second affirmative, up-
held the contention that Southern
wealth had nosedived because of
Northern reconstruction. As well as
economic advantages, he said, many
cultural advantages would have re-
sulted if the South had won the
war.

As examples, Clark noted South-
ern Parties—famous for their su-
periority, and well known writers—
Stowe, Poe. Eckes hastened to make
mention of Tennessee Williams.
Substituting Uncle Remus for Uncle
Sam as a political figurehead, Clark
pointed out other Southern cultural
advantages, such as the engender-
ment of noble characters as person-
ified by himself and Noell.

High Band

Delights 4,500 Grid Crowd

A delightful mixture of an inter-
national tour and a return to the
swing era of the 1930’s entertained
4,500 Washington and Lee parents

Hoover On Communism
(Continued from page 2)

It is a dissilusionment that causes
many to forsake communism, says
Hoover. Many eventually realize
that communist methods rarely coin-
cide with communists goals. In other
sections of the book, Hoover dis-
cusses the origins and historical de-
velopments of communism, the con-
tributions to its ideology by various
men, its present power structure, its
imperialistic policies, and its chal-
lenge to freedom.

Dr. O. Hobart Mowrer will

7:30 in duPont Audi-

torium.

Dr. Mowrer’s appearance on the
Washington and Lee campus marks
the first of three speakers scheduled
to appear at the university this
year under the auspices of the
Seminars in Religion program.

Dr. Mowrer also will speak to|
several religion and_ psychology |
classes during his visit.

The departments of religion and
psychology and the University

taught at Harvard and Yale Uni-
versities and held research fellow-

In addition to more than 100
articles in research and_profes-

He received his undergraduate de-

great majority of W&L students
know very little about their school
Medical Center and even less about
the new Infirmary. Both are located
in the basement of the New Fresh-

24 hours a day. A registered nurse
is always on duty there and for
more serious cases a doctor is on
call day and night.

From 8:00 to 11:00 in the morning,
Dr. Feddeman is on hand for sick
call. As a new policy this year,
anyone with a non-critical injury is|
to report to the Medical Center
before going to the hospital; other-
wise they will not be admitted to
the hospital. If no one is in the Medi-
cal Center during the lunch hour, |

What is the function of certain parts |
of the brain? 2) What pleasure if
any, comes from brain stimulation?

In to answer the
first question, the students have
taken several rats and have
trained them to de a task. After
the rats have been taught, a por-
tion of them are operated on, and
a part of the cortex is removed
from each one. After the opera-
tion the rats are tested to see if
they can perform their task. If the
rats fail, the part of the brain
which was removed must have
been the part that held the know-
ledge.

However, there is some misunderstanding as to whether
the Honor System applies only to the Commerce Library. This
is not the case. All departmental libraries as well as Mc-
Cormick Library are included under the Honor System. This
is with respect to “cases involving intentional, wrongful re-
moval of books or any other property from the library.”

We here at Washington and Lee are very fortunate to have
our library operated on the basis of free access. At many insti-
tutions, it is impossible for one to enter the stacks or even
to remove without special permission. Here we attempt to have

the most liberal system possible.

tained with the cooperation and support of the student body.

There may be some that contend that an unauthorized
removal of a book is not a breach of the honor system. It can
be argued that the person did not intend to steal the book and
would eventually return it. However, the removal of the book
may deprive other students of its use. This would be a violation

of one’s personal honor.

In addition, it is fitting that this particular section be in-

cluded under the Honor System

tions of the gym. It would hardly seem fair to have the “bor-
rowing” of a jock strap regarded as a more serious offense
than the unauthorized removal of a book.

We And The Veemies

We are pleased to note the

and Lee students at the review held in our honor by VMI yes-
terday. This full dress inspection was conceived by the student
government of VMI in the interest of promoting better rela-

tions between the two schools.

The Library Decision

The Student Library Committee has recently announced
several policy changes on regulations regarding the library.
These new rules generally add to and strengthen those already
in effect. All of these policies are designed to protect our library
and make it more convenient for students.

SCC States Position
On Campus Drinking

By TOM RAINS
Friday Columnist

Ours is not a tradition.

There is a common assumption
persistent among the student body
that all or the ma-
jority of student-
operated functions
are based on tra-
dition and the de-
- termination to up-
hold it. And, in
many cases, this
assumption is true,
for some student
activities were
formulated years
in the past, found
to be successful,
and have since operated in the guid-
ing light of their origin, with, of
course, certain modifications which
yield to the contemporary demand.
However, there being no criticism
here of this traditional operation, it
is nevertheless necessary to dis-
tinguish between this type of or-
ganization which functions in the
manner mentioned above and one
which is the result of the demands
of the student body.

In its present state, which con-
forms with a national and interna-
tional student, the student body of
Washington and Lee is producing a
constant demand to have more re-
sponsibility and leadership placed
in their own hands. Last year the
Administration took a very large
step in this direction by placing
the handling of disciplinary cases
arising from the various actions of
students in the hands of the stu-
dents themselves. Thus was the for-
mation of the Student Control Com-
mittee. There can be no question as
to the manner in which it was
formed, for it was a step taken by
the Administrative Committee, but
only in conjunction with the stu-
dent government, the Executive
Committee, and with, again, the de-
mands of the students. The primary
intent was not to produce another
tradition to tell incoming students
and their parents about, thus pub-

Rains

 

licizing the age and integrity of this
institution, and thus to have some-
thing to tell succeeding gener-

ations about. Rather, the intent was | Hag

to spread the area of self-govern-
ment among students and to place
the responsibility of “student con-
trol” on the students themselves.
This does not eliminate the possi-
bility of the Student Control Com-
mittee becoming a tradition, but
again, this was not the primary
attempt, nor is it the matter at hand.

Public Drinking

To turn now to the most recent
issue in which the Control Commit-
tee was involved, that of dealing
with drinking on the upper field at
home football games, it seems to
be necessary to offer some kind of
clarification for the actions of the
Committee. This assumption is based
on comments made on this action,
both pro and con, and both spoken
and written. There was, and prob-
ably still is in some instances, a com-
mon misunderstanding of the rule
concerning drinking on school prop-
erty, particularly in the area of
the intramural field, the parking
area for football games, the “upper
field,’ Alumni Field, or whatever
else this place may be called. Some
feel that sufficient notice was not
given about the reinforcement of
this many-year-old rule, and others
think that no notice was given at
all about this, or, at least, they did
not see it. But to give a simple and
brief answer to this problem of
“lack of notice,” there was a notice
placed in the Ring-tum Phi on the
front page indicating that drinking
on this field at football games was
a violation of the school rule. (The
rule states that there is to be no
consumption of alcoholic beverages
on school property.) Also, during the
same week two notices appeared on
the ODK bulletin board stating that
two students had been placed on
Social Probation for drinking on
school property. And, without doubt
the average intelligence of the
Washington and Lee student body

Art Exhibit Displays
Old Japanese Prints

The present art exhibit is now
in its final week at duPont Hall.
On loan from the Virginia Museum
of Fine Arts, it is an example of
Eighteenth Century Japanese block
printing by Hiroshige. This exhibit
is part of the Art Department’s
program of presenting new and
varying shows each month.

Hiroshige was one of the two
greatest artists of his period. In
contrast with his equally well-
known contemporary, Hokusai, who
centered his works around the vast-
ness of nature, Hiroshige empha-
sized personal scenes from nature.

All of his works were done in
series. This exhibit was done along
the Tokaido Road, which runs the
345 miles from Tokyo to the ancient
capital of Mikada. The scenes for
his prints were taken from the 53
halting places along the way.

This type of print required the

 

talents of an artist, engraver, and
printer. A design drawn on paper
was pasted face down on a block
of wood. Then the engraver would
scrape away the paper until the
design showed through. He then
carved the wood so that the lines
were in relief. A different block was
necessary for every color tone.

Next the blocks were carefully
inked. If this was done incorrectly
the shade of color on the print would
be inferior. At the exhibit there are
displays of the same block well done
and poorly done.

Accompanying the display are sev-
veral photographs taken this sum-
mer along this road which demon-
strate the timelessness of these pic-
tures. It is also shown how Hiro-
shige’s work influenced the works of
Monet, Van Gogh, Whistler, and
Gauguin.

 

 

SYMPOSIA...

 

 

 

 

Handlin Asks ‘Are Colleges Killing Education ?’

This week the Ring-tum Phi in- |
troduces a new series. This series,
to be known as SYMPOSIA...,
concerns itself with the broad field
of education. We hope to present
views and concerns both of those
buying this commodity of edu-
cation and of those dispensing it.

While we do not wave any fire-
brands, we feel that education and
our particular brand of education
here at Washington and Lee de-
serves scrutiny from a new point
of view. What is needed is a fresh
and revitalized outlook toward
those revered institutions which
have come down to us through the
years. We shall undoubtedly pre-
sent criticisms positive and nega-
tive, and it is our hope that both
will be heard equally. If one will
only look at such publications as
The Atlantic, Harpers, and Satur-
day Review, he will see that the
same questioning and re-evalua-
tion is going on throughout the en-
tire American educational system.
It is our hope to do a thorough
and comprehensive job of  re-
evaluating at our own local level.

SYMPOSIA is honored to begin
its series by reprinting an article
by Osear Handlin which appeared
in the May, 1962 issue of The Atlant-
ic. Mr. Handlin is presently located
in the Center for Study of the His-
tory of Liberty in America at Har-
vard. He is the author of several
books, among which is The Uproot-
ed, a study of the immigrant in
America, which won him the Pulit-
zer Prize in 1952. He is also a fre-
quent contributor to scholarly and
general periodicals, particularly in
the field of education.
SYMPOSIA..., is edited, organ-
ized, and written by Bill Kinsey.
All contributions and suggestions are
welcome, and all letters will be
published.

With the coming of spring, hys-

teria creeps across the campus.
Tension mounts steadily, and even
when it does not erupt in some
overt form, it still disturbs the last
two months of the college year.
Now is the time when the steadily

 

growing psychiatric staffs come into
their own. |

The young people who brood in|
their rooms, who forget to come}
down to the dining hall, and who |
burst out in fits of irrationality are
not worrying about who will win the
great game or who will come to the
dance or be tapped for the frater-
nity. Joe College is dead, and his
little anxieties are unrecognizably
antique. His successors are immersed
in their books and laboratories, and
their concern is for the grade that
an incomprehensible marking system
will grind out for them.

Among the undergraduates, it is
worst for the juniors. Most of the
seniors are reconciled; they have by
now amassed whatever capital they
will possess and know it is too late
to make serious changes. The sopho-
mores are frenetically hopeful; de-
spite the facts of the past, they
feel that they have a chance. The
freshmen are still reeling from the
shock of self-discovery but are not
yet fully aware of what has hit
them. The juniors are, and therefore
the panic that all share to some ex-
tent is particularly intense among
them.

The phenomenon is_relaiively
recent, and it is not everywhere
the same. Indeed, there may still
be some refuge which is entirely
unaffected, where college remains
a place of learning, not a race-
track. But year by year the infec-
tion spreads, and it seems most
virulent in the best institutions
and among the best students.

The American college functions
with a time-encrusted mechanism,
much of it immensely valuable be-
cause of the experience, tradition,
and wisdom built into it. But some
of its devices were designed for
purposes long since forgotten. We
do not question their presence;
the grating noise they make seems

|a necessary part of the operation.

Who can imagine that this is the
sound of minds being crushed in a
process that frustrates the whole
educational enterprise?

Those great big beautiful A’s so
avidly sought, those little, miserly
C’s so often found, were meant
for another time and another stu-
dent body. They were the tools of
a teacher in the day when the col-
lege was more a disciplinary than

 

an educational institution. The mis-
cellaneous lots of boys and young
men who recited their lessons in
the eighteenth- and _nineteenth-
century American college were in-
differently prepared, only occasion-
ally interested, and given to out-
bursts that took them altogether out
of control. The instructor needed
grades and fines and other punish-
ments to keep them in hand.

The problems of discipline became
less pressing when the college ac-
quired its modern institutionalized
form. The grading system neverthe-
less retained its importance. The
curriculum was divided into blocks
of courses, each worth a number
of points, and an education was de-
fined by the score that stood to the
student’s credit in the college ac-
counting system. The grade then
became critical, because it was evi-
dence of the amount of learning de-
posited to his credit.

The pattern has persisted, al-
though a few remember what
forces brought it into being. Yet
no faculty would now maintain
that education can be defined by
a balance sheet of credits, or that
the statistical magic that produces
grade scores carried to the second
decimal place is a reliable way of
evaluating students.

Until recently the system was
hardly effective enough to do much
harm. A large percentage of the
student body could afford to dis-
regard it entirely. After the man-|
ner of the lads in Owen Wister’s |
Philosophy 4, they looked down on)
the grinds and occupied themselves |
in their own ways. And the minority |
who were interested could study |
away to their hearts’ content without |
the anxiety of involvement in a mass |
competition. |

All has now changed. The new)
students enter after a rigid selec-
tive process, they present few dis-
ciplinary problems, and they arrive’
after good and uniform preparation. |
The constant surveillance of their
studies serves no useful function!
and only interferes with their edu-
cation.

The trouble is that the students |
themselves do not know it. The gen-
eration has been so thoroughly har- |
nessed to the treadmill of the ex-|
amination that it accepts its servi-j|

 

tude as a normal if strenuous con-
dition of life. All the external pres-
sures of society encourage that be-
lief. Since education has become a
national emergency, it is a patriotic
duty to do well in algebra. The
student who gets an A in physics
will not only advance to a success-
ful career but will also defend his
country against the Russians. The
talented boy has replaced the ath-
lete as the school hero, and the
letter worth getting is no longer
that on the sweater but that on the
report card.

The process of subversion be-
gins almost in the first years of
the best high schools. The most
highly motivated students know
that they are engaged in a close
race; only the fleetest will enter
the desirable colleges. Ahead of
them loom the great goals, the
College Boards and the National
Merit competition. Along the way
are the lesser hurdles they must
surmouna, and their task is to
train themselves to score well.

How can their high school educa-
tion have any other meaning? Ad-
mission to college comes generally
in the spring of their senior year
and is based on performances on
tests taken a good deal earlier.
Everything that comes later is total-

ly irrelevant. Furthermore, a variety | the snap courses “which get you

of schemes for early admission and |

early appraisal have pushed some

|of the tests back to the middle of

the third year of high school. For
many students, therefore, almost
half of their secondary school career
becomes meaningless, since it does
not prepare them for the examina-
tions. It is a rare teacher who can
resist the tendency to turn his
classes into extended cram sessions.

Alas, the young people finally dis-
cover that entry into college solves
no problems. It only reveals the new

| hurdles they could not earlier see. |

True, the place is strange and the
conditions of life new, but the race
is the same, only the pace is faster.
Back in those innocent high school

i days, these boys and girls were a

select group—the brightest and best.
Now they are thrown into a mass in
which everyone is select and every-
one had been brightest and best. In
this renewed competition some who
had always been winners discovered |

 

that they too will have to be losers
The cruelty of the contest is clear-
est in courses which establish grades
on the basis of a statistical distri-
bution curve. No matter how hard
they work, or how able they are,
one half of the class will fall be-
low the average. Each _ student,
therefore, finds himself involved in
a struggle with his neighbor, whose
success will drag him down.

Any freshman can grasp the
point of the explanation for his D
on the question in Philosophy H.
“No, there was nothing particular-
ly wrong with the answer. But
everyone else in the section did so
well that the classifying apparatus
sorted you out toward the lowest
of the pigeonholes.” He will learn
thereafter to crowd his way to the
top.

Meanwhile, the goal of college is
the same as that of high school—
the high score will open the way to
the next stage of competition. Now
the students work for the grades
that will admit them to the graduate
or professional school. The intense
haste with which they reach toward
what they mistakenly believe to be
narrowing opportunities shortens
their vision. Tactics become pre-
eminently important. These young
people work hard, and they shun

nowhere.” But they tiptoe gingerly
through the curriculum, weighing
all the angles. One will regularly
carry an additional course all year,
then at the last possible moment
drop that in which the risk is the
greatest. Another sacrifices each
summer vacation, not to shorten his
studies, but because instructors are
reputed to grow more pliable as
the temperature rises. And only the
reckless will dare not to know the
right answers as the grader expects
them, or allow questions to draw
their thinking in unexpected direc-
tions.

Many students now feel unbear-
able pressure from their parents.
The strain is not consciously ap-
plied, but it is none the less real.
It is the product of a situation
that leads young people to wonder
whether their careers in college
will jeopardize the love and af-
fection of their parents.

 

Each family has hopefully groomed
its own aspirants for the race. Mom
and Dad have often made genuine
sacrifice of time and energy to be
sure their hopeful was adequately
prepared. They must not be disap-
pointed. The boy who does well ad-
vances to scholarships and jobs that
will immediately have an effect upon
the income of the whole family. The
one who does not becomes a drag,
reducing his father’s chances for a
new car, his little sister’s prospects
for an expensive education,

The solicitous letters and regu-
lar telephone calls impress upon the
student that fact that it is not he
alone who is being tested, but the
whole family. How proud they are
when the stock rises, how concerned
when it falls! The A shows the
virtue of the home and the school
that produced the good performer.
The C is not only a blow to the ego
of the recipient; it is a reflection
upon the adequacy of his training.
Unless they rebel entirely, the young
people carry to class the anxiety,
lest they let down those who had
invested in them. So much hangs
on the outcome.

The proliferation of rewards has,
paradoxically, stimulated this de-
structive competition. The National
Science Foundation and the Wood-
row Wilson fellowships have done
immense good. But, at the same time,
they have put undesirable pressure
on the aspirants. Those who make
it are free (they think); they see
themselves firmly planted on the
academic escalator with a regular
income, security, and marriage just
within reach. The attractiveness of
these immediate goals obscures every
other consideration.

It is vain to point out that success
in tests is not necessarily the way
to achievement, that careers of great
men do not always begin with a
ranking in the upper tenth percen-
tile, that places are available, and
that there are other than competi-
tive values to education. Their whole
experience points in the other di-
rection,

o ££ 8

The losses to the students and to
society are tremendous. The dis-
torted emphasis nullifies much of
what the colleges aim to do.

Team Back To Strength;
Seek Sixth Season Victory

Washington and Lee starts it bid
for the football championship of the
College Athletic Conference Satur-
day when the Generals meet Centre
College at Danville, Ky.

Assured of a winning season with
a 5-1 record to date, the Generals
close out their 1962 campaign in
three games with conference opposi-
tion. After Center, W&L is host to
Sewanee the following weekend, and
then travels to Memphis for the sea-
son finale with Southwestern.

Centre’s Colonels, a team the
Generals defeated last year by a
53-0 score, are winless to date
(0-4-1), but according to their
scores and W&L scouts, they are
a much stronger squad than in
1961.

“They've made some backfield
switches that have improved their
offense,” says W&L Coach Lee Mc-
Laughlin. “And they’ve got Ron
Kimberlin in the line, as fine a guard
as we've seen this year.”

Centre’s backfield changes invol-
ved position rotation for quarter-
back Bob Hourigan, a halfback in
1961, and halfback Del Hatfield, the
Colonels’ field general last year.

The Colonels are not contenders
for the new conference’s first trophy,
but Seout Buck Leslie rates them
as potential spoilers. In last Satur-
day’s game with Sewanee, the Col-
onels were down only 14-6 in the
fourth quarter before the Tigers
managed a two touchdown outburst
that produced a 28-6 victory. Earlier
in the year, Centre lost to South-
western in league play.

McLaughlin expects Centre to
operate from its true T-formation,
although he remembers last year
when the Colonels threw a shotgun
spread at the Generals. McLaughlin
also expects his team to encounter
a favorite Centre defensive maneuv-
er, the 11-man line.

McLaughlin’s biggest worry is
not what Centre may throw at the

Generals, but the long bus ride to
Danville. W&L is not due to arrive
in Danville until around midnight
Friday. Last season, a late-night
bus ride to St. Louis, after air
flights were grounded, nearly re-
sulted in an upset loss to Washing-
ton University, so the W&L Coach
is wary of this week’s travel ar-
rangements,

Regarding the surprising ease
(55-14) with which W&L bested
Franklin and Marshall last Saturday,
McLaughlin thinks perhaps the
Diplomats played below par, while
the Generals, particularly the third
and fourth units, were operating at
premium efficiency.

“IT was real pleased to see our
Red (second) team move well, for
I knew those boys were capable, but

it was something of a bonus to get
sharp performances from our Gold
and White teams,” the Generals’
coach said.

The Generals may be in the best
shape physically against Centre
than they’ve been in weeks. Oft-
injured Red unit tackle Phil Mc-
Caleb returned to duty against
F&M and according to McLaugh-
lin, “ate their halfbacks alive.”
McCaleb also cashed in on_ his
specialty, a blocked punt.

W&L also may have a healthy
and fit Henry Sackett Saturday.

(Continued on page 4)

Yoffe Named

 

Stu Yoffe’s 14 points and 13.2
yards per carry average in last

Saturday’s 55-14 slaughter of Frank-
lin and Marshall have earned him
the Sports Star nomination this
week.

The 190-pound junior right half-
back reeled off 79 yards in six car-
ries, scoring two
touchdowns and
accounting for one
conversion.

Early in the first
quarter it was his
40 - yard run
through the Dip-
lomat secondary
that set up his
on-foot plunge in-
to the end zone
and the first W&L
score.

Good fakes and added help from
the powerful General forward wall
enabled Yoffe to play, as coach Lee

 

Yoffe

McLaughlin termed it, “the best
game he’s had.”
Yoffe has now taken over the

number two scoring spot in the state,
edging out W&L’s own Tommy Kee-
see. He is now only 12 points be-
hind the state’s leading scorer, Earl
Hawkins of Emory and Henry. Haw-
kins leads the list with 50 points

Colonels 0-2 |
In CAC Play

The College Athletic Conference |
has its busiest Saturday of the 1962 |
football season this week as the four
teams competing for the new league’s
first championship meet in games
at Sewanee, Tenn., and Danville,
Ky.

Sewanee and Southwestern, both |
with conference wins over Centre |
College, meet at Sewanee in a con-
test matching the league’s best of-
fense against its best defense. Coach
Shirley Major’s Tigers have rolled
up 299 yards per game in compiling
a 3-1-1 record to date, while the
Lynx have limited their opposition
to 169 yards a game for a 4-2 slate.

Washington and Lee, 5-1, makes
its first bid for the ‘the against
Centre in a homecoming game for
the wineless Colonels, now 0-4-1.
The Generals boast the confer-
ence’s best rushing attack, 245.7
yards per game, and its best scor-
ing punch, 28.5 points per game.
Centre’s strongest suit is its pass
defense, a league-leading 38.8
a game,

flexed its conference
muscles last Saturday, defeating
Centre, 28-6, in a game tht was
close until the final quarter. South-
western moved past Maryville, 7-0,
and Washington and Lee rolled over
Franklin & Marshall, 55-14.
Sewanee’s great tailback, M. L.
Agnew stretched his total offense |
lead in the conference with a 136-|
yard rushing performance against |
the Colonels. Agnew now has gained |
390 yards on the ground and 320)
in the air for a total offense mark |

of 710 yards.

Sewanee

 

Agnew’s closest challenge is
W&L fullback Tommy Keesee’s |
391 yards, while Centre quarter-
back Buck Hourigan is right be- |
hind with 389 yards. Agnew’s
rushing and passing totals also are
the best in the conference.
Southwestern’s Bill Harwood is |

the top receiver with 14 catches for
125 yards. Hourigan is the top punt- |
er with a 33.4 yard average on 23 |
kicks.

Among conference scoring leaders,

Washington and Lee has three of
the top four. The Generals’ Stu Yof-
fe, a junior right halfback, is the
pace-setter with 38 points on six
touchdowns and a conversion run.
Keesee is second with 32 points,
Agnew is third with 26, and W&L’s
left half, junior Henry Sackett, has
24,

No team in the conference boasts
a strong passing attack, although
Washington and Lee claims an ef-

 

with Yoffe trailing at ; 38.

North Carolina Falls To Bootmen 6-0;
Sixth Win In Sight Against Roanoke

By LOUIS MONGEAU

Sports Editor
After their 6-0 defeat of North |
Carolina State Tuesday, coach Joe
Lyles feels that his varsity soccer
| team is ready for Roanoke College. |
The team will be seeking its sixth |

| victory as it meets Roanoke in that |

school’s Homecoming game Satur- |

The question is: IF SOCRATES WERE ALIVE TODAY, WHAT WOULD HE ADVISE
SMOKERS? Good, smart advice. Of course it makes sense to enjoy the fine-
tobacco taste of Lucky Strike. This taste is the best reason to start with Luckies
... the big reason Lucky smokers stay Lucky smokers. And this same taste is
what makes Lucky Strike the favorite regular cigarette of college students.

TOPIC WILL BE MODERN POETRY
By STEVE SMITH

Northrop Frye, considered by many scholars the foremost
literary critic of this era, has been announced as the speaker

for Washington and Lee’s 42nd

Frye, who will come to W&L under the auspices of the

University Center in Virginia,

of Imagery in Modern Poetry,”

certain poems of Eliot, Yeats, and*¥———

N eophyte

Wallace Stevens.

Frye, Principal of Victoria College,
University of Toronto, is the author
of Fearful Symmetry, the most im- |
portant book on Blake’s poetry in
recent years; and Anatomy of Criti-
cism, praised as the most influential
study of literary criticism to be
written in the present century.

New Critical Method

In Anatomy of Criticism Frye
presents his own method of criticism,
an attempt to treat literature and
its forms comprehensively. The
book and its method were received
by widespread acclaim.

Frye is also the editor of Milton,
Sound and Poetry, and the Canadi-
an Forum. He is a Fellow of the
Royal Society of Canada, former
chairman of the English Institute,
and a member of the Executive
Council of the Modern Languages
Association,

The Seminars in Literature pro-
gram, which was founded in 1951,
exists for the purpose of bringing
to the university about four speak-
ers a year. The Seminars commit-
tee cooperates with the Virginia
University Center, an organization
which attempts by a program of
speakers to overcome the isolation
possible to a small college.

Members of the University Center
include 21 Virginia colleges and
universities. Washington and Lee is
represented on the visiting schol-
ars committee of the Center by Pro-
fessor Allen W. Moger.

Speakers brought to Washington
and Lee under the Seminar program
are available for classroom discus-
sion with students.

Seminar Committee Members

The Seminar committee elected
four new members during the month
of October: Jerome Kahn, Taine
Tompkins, J. Paxton Davis, and
James Boatwright. Continuing from
last year on the committee are
Arthur R. Borden, Jr., William
Chaplain, Meade Christian, G. Fran-
cis Drake, Hunter Manson, Robert
Mottley, Philip Reidford, and Walker
Ronaldson,

Past speakers for the Seminars
in Literature have included William
Faulkner, John Ciardi, Stephen
Spender, Katherine Anne Porter,
and other famous names.

Frye will speak in duPont Audi- |
torium at 8:15 p.m., on the last
Wednesday in November.

The Seminars in Literature will
be held during the same week as
the annual Glasgow Endowment
Program.

Show Style

By MALCOLM MORRIS
Four Washington and Lee fresh-
men, competing in the Wake Forest
Novice Tournament this past Friday
and Saturday, finished a strong sixth
in a field of twenty-four teams.

Losing only to the top four teams
in the “strength against strength”
tournament, both the affirmative and
negative sides compiled records of
four wins and two losses.

Mike Hayslip and Bob Potts, de-
bating the affirmative side of the
question, conquered William and
Mary, Randolph-Macon, Duke, and
the University of Richmond, be-
fore losing close rounds to George
Washington and the University of
Pittsburgh.

The negative team of John Mc-
Murry and Gareth Aden lost only
to the University of Richmond and
Wake Forest while defeating South
Carolina, Davidson, Lenoir-Rhyne,
and Duke.

 

 

Ahead of W&L’s sixth place team |
were George Washington, Wake.
Forest, the University of Pittsburgh, |
the University of Richmond, and_
Duke.

Mike Hyslip, who led the men in
total points, received an award for
finishing eighth among the tourna- |
ment’s ninety-six speakers.

Debate team director William W.
Chaffiin said he was well pleased
with the results: “The best novice
record in several years.” He pointed
out Hayslip for his great potential
and appraised this year’s freshman
class as the most promising in re-
cent years.

Last year’s team finished even at
six wins and six losses in the same
tournament .

Release Anticipated This Week

By STEVE SMITH

James Boatwright, editor of Shen-
andoah, announced today that the
Washington and Lee literary maga-
zine will make its 1962-63 debut this
week. E. E. Cummings heads the
list of contributors to the first issue
under Boatwright’s direction.

The fall edition will include a
variety of poetry, fiction, and criti-
cism, by a wide range of writers.
“The issue has no particular theme,”
Boatwright said. “We've included
less criticism than usual this time;
instead ‘the emphasis has been on
the best fiction and verse available.”

Shenandoah is undergoing a basic
change in character beginning with
the coming issue. The first inova-
tion to be made was the appoint-
ment of Boatwright as the year’s
editor, subject to re-election by the
magazine’s editorial board; previous-
ly each issue of Shenandoah had

of a rotating board of editors. In
addition, Shenandoah will be pub-
lished quarterly instead of of the
former three times a year.

These moves have ben made in
an attempt to give Shenandoah a
consistent editorial policy, which
should improve the magazine gen-
erally. At the same time, the busi-
ness staff is driving to increase cir-
culation, notably by initiating the
sales of subscriptions as Christmas
gifts.

Authors appearing in the fall

Dr. Morrison Hutcheson New Rector;
Mr. Caskie Remains Board Member

James R. Caskie, Lynchburg attorney and civic leader has
resigned as Rector of Washington and Lee University’s Board
of Trustees, it was announced today by President Fred C. Cole.

Mr Caskie, who is 77, informed the Board of his decision

at its regular October meeting.

prevent him from continuing as Rector, although he will re-
—- on

main a member of the Board.

Elected to succeed Mr. Caskie as
Rector was Dr. J. Morrison Hutche-
son, Richmond physician and _pro-
fessor emeritus at the Medical Col-
lege of Virginia.

Mr. Caskie joined Washington and
Lee’s Board in 1924, and was elected
Rector in 1953. He is a graduate of
Washington and Lee, receiving his
A.B. degree in 1906, and his LL.B.
degree in 1909.

Dr. Hutcheson, who is 79, received

Lee in 1902. He was elected to the
Board of Trustees in 1935, and has
served on its executive committee
since 1940.

“Under Mr. Caskie’s rectorship the
University has made great strides
in improving its academic program
and physical facilities,’ President
Cole commented. “The dedication of
Mr. Caskie to his Alma Mater is
clearly indicated in his willingness
to continue as a trustee, although he
feels it is necessary to relinquish his
chairmanship. Dr, Hutcheson’s long
service and close association with the
University gives assurance _ that
Washington and Lee will continue
its educational leadership.”

Mr. Caskie is senior partner in
the Lynchburg law firm of Caskie,
Frost, Davidson and Watts. In ad-
dition to his service as Rector, Mr.
Caskie also has acted as an unpaid
general counsel to Washington and
Lee University.

A native of Lovingston, Va., Mr.
Caskie began his law practice in
Lynchburg shortly after graduation
from Washington and Lee. He was
first a partner with his father,
George Evans Caskie, and upon his
father’s death in 1919, Mr. Caskie
practiced alone until 1925 when the
first of his present partners joined
his firm.

Civic and Church Leader

Among his church and civie ac-
tivities, Mr. Caskie has served as
director and secretary and treasurer
of the Presbyterian Orphans Home
in Lynchburg for 25 years, and also
as chairman of the board of the
Lynchburg Hospital Authority and
president of Lynchburg General
Hospital. He also serves as director
and attorney for numerous corpor-
ations.

Honor and the Libraries
As the Friday edition pointed out, there has been more
than a little confusion concerning the application of the Honor

System to the libraries. Unfortunately, and through no fault
of the editors, the Friday editorial only added to the confusion.

 

The Executive Committee has not laid down a hard and
fast rule that unauthorized removal of a book is automatically
an honor violation. There is a very good reason for this: a flat
statement linking unauthorized removal of books with the
Honor System would have the effect of categorizing honor
violations, and this, in turn, would inevitably lead to inflex-
ibility and perhaps injustice. The Executive Committee rightly
insists on trying every case on its own merits, using only
lying, cheating, and stealing as the prerequisites for action.

It was with this idea in mind that the EC ordered that
notices be posted in McCormick Library stating that “Cases
involving intentional, wrongful removal of books or any other
property from the library will be reported to the Executive
Committee for investigation as a possible violation of the
Honor System.” This simply means that the EC will investi-
gate each reported case and attempt to ascertain whether or not
stealing is involved. This does not represent a change in policy.
It simply means that the Student Library Committee is on the
watch for possible violations of the Honor System in the
library.

This same policy will prevail in the Commerce School li-
brary. Those statements will be removed which read ‘Removal
of any material from the Commerce Library will be considered
a breech of the Honor System,” and they will be replaced by
statements similar to those in McCormick Library.

Stealing is a violation of the Honor System, and stealing
from the various campus libraries is the same as stealing any-
where else. But the Honor System is not intended to be a
means by which to enforce rules, and, again, the libraries are
no exception,

Height Of Disillusionment

The London Daily Mail reports that Fidel Castro has been
in an especially bad mood lately.

Apparently he can’t get over the fact that this time last
week he was a nuclear power.

A Minor Mistake

Last Friday we printed an editorial in which we implied
that W&L and VMI had enjoyed a spirited athletic rivalry up
until W&L’s de-subsidization in 1954. Well, our chronology
was off about fifty years. The truth is that the last time Wash-
ington and Lee played VMI in football was back in the Victor-
ian era, somewhere around 1902. At that time the administra-
tions of both schools agreed that the rivalry was much too spirit-
od, and that cross-town athletic contests constituted a genuine
threat to the physical well-being of all those concerned. Evi-
dently, when W&L students sang that they would “fight, fight,
fight for every yard,” they meant exactly that, and thus, as a
matter of practical necessity, athletic competition between the
two schools ceased.

But a mere fifty years does not change our conviction that
VMI’s parade was a very worthwhile affair. At least two hun-
dred students turned out for the ceremony, and it is seldom that
W&L men voluntarily congregate in such numbers. This in
itself means something. Further, the atmosphere was definitely
one of friendliness; certainly no one wanted to fight.

The Friday edition’s opinion to the contrary, we think that
the VMI parade was a very effective way to promote under-
standing between the two student bodies. To the cliche that
“It’s a step in the right direction,” we will add another: “Better
late than never.”

To Our Subscribers

An Open Letter to Ring-tum Phi Subscribers:

In the beginning of the school year, an unavoidable sit-
uation resulted in many of our subscribers not receiving their
copies of The Ring-tum Phi. What had happened was that our
addressing machine was out of order for nearly three weeks,
during which time no papers could be mailed.

After the machine was adequately repaired, the circulation
staff was left with the job of mailing the accumulation of back
issues to subscribers. Obviously, some mistakes were made and
a few subscribers did not receive copies of some of the paper’s
edition that came out in that three-week period.

We apologize to anyone whom we overlooked, and we are
eager to rectify the situation. Please drop us a line if you
missed a paper, and we will be more than glad to send it to
you.

The letters we have already received concerning the cir-
culation problem were greatly appreciated, and helped us in
straightening out a seemingly hopeless confusion.

Thank you for understanding our position during the
Ring-tum Phi “crisis,” and if we can be of any assistance in the
the future don’t hesitate to write us.

Business Staff, Ring-tum Phi

 

Academic Rise
Of University
Is Analyzed

By ROGER PAINE
Managing Editor

Of all the recent topics of con-
versation concerning W&L, perhaps
the most discussed is the so-called
“changing face” of the college. In-
deed, this topic has been given so
much lip-service and so niuch news-
paper space that it has become
a rather tired cliche.

Change is essential to freshness,
however, and it is the academic
change which has occurred, most
notably in the past four years, which
deserves our attention. Admissions
officers have boasted each year for
the past three years that each fresh-
man class is smarter and better pre-
pared than was the one before it.

This statement is true, for college
board scores, though they have not
risen phenomenally, have gone up
steadily each year. Freshmen are
coming to W&L today better pre-
pared and with somewhat higher
aptitude, and the improvement
along this line has fostered much
of the change which has taken place
all along the gallery of Washington
and Lee customs.

Fewer Dropouts

Another remarkable thing is that
fewer students are dropping out of
W&L than ever before. Last year
there were not near so many stu-
dents who found they could not take
the academic rigors of the college
as there were four years ago.

Especially gifted students are en-
hanced to remain at W&L for many
seasons, which have been inaugurated
into the college’s curriculum in only
the past few years: placement tests
which give advanced freshmen a
chance to begin courses on a sopho-
more level, opportunities for R. E.
Lee research grants, new majors in
sociology and contemporary civili-
zation, a new science building, a
renewed interest in debating, the
availability of sufficient loans to
able students who run into finan-
cial difficulty mid-way through
W&L, and the stepped-up program
of personal counseling made possible
by Dr. Sprunt’s work as Assistant
Dean of Students.

More Graduates

The result of all this is shown by
the fact that more and more men
who come to W&L as freshmen are
staying the entire four years and
graduating as seniors. The seniors
whom W&L graduates are better
prepared, it would seem, than ever
before, to cope with the complex-
ities of society. Students take dif-
ficult courses today where five years
ago they would have chosen the
easier ones just for the sure grade.

It is interesting to compare grades
themselves as given to the student
body in the spring semester of 1956
and those given last spring. Six years
ago the percentage of A’s given was
12.92, as compared with 11.87 last
year. A full percentage point dif-
ference, though difficult to correctly
analyze, may indicate that students
today are demanding, and getting,
more difficult subject matter with
which to deal, and that the realm
of excellence has drifted higher.

Grades Similar

The number of B’s given in the
two year’s was identical, but there
was a sharp rise of 3 per cent more
C’s given last spring than there
were in 1956. The reason for this
is that there were many more E’s
ana F’s given in 1956. than last year.
Last spring, 2.53 per cent of the total
grades given were F’s, and in 1956,
3.33 per cent were F’s. The number
of D’s given, however, is identical
for the two years—10.53 per cent of
the total grades given both years.

The most striking thing is the
lack of difference shown in these
statistics. Grades given in 1956 and
in 1962 were almost identical, with
the only difference coming in the
number of low grades received.

Next week a more detailed anal-
ysis of the growing intellectual
enthusiasm at W&L will be made,
including comments from professors,
and deans, and supporting figures
from University records.

Men of Achievement

 

Alumni of Washington and Lee:
A Compliment to the University

By TRACY HARRINGTON |

There’s something special about
being a Washington and Lee student.
For four years, all of us feel a kind
of kindred spirit with 1,000 other
men of the University.

But what about after that four
years? Is there anything “special”
about W&L alumni?

According to facts we have been
able to obtain, there is something
very special about W&L alumni—
and it might be summed up in the
single word “success.”

Because all of us will be (hope-
fully) Washington and Lee alumni
for a much longer time than we are
students here, the Tuesday Ring-tum
Phi is beginning with this edition
a series of articles on noted alumni.

As a starter, a few statistics are
in order:

Five ABA Presidents

There have been five Presidents
of the American Bar Association
who graduated from Washington
and Lee. As far as we can find out,

that record is Harvard.

At the present time, there are at
least five college presidents among
our alumni, and possibly one more.

Six Rhodes scholars have come
from Washington and Lee.

Three of the seven justices of the
Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals
are W&L alumni, as are three past
justices of the U.S. Supreme Court.

There are presently seven bank
presidents (at least) among W&L
graduates, as well as vice presidents
of the Pullman Company (recently

deceased), Scott Paper Company,
and the National Broadcasting
Company.

And the present governor of West
Viirginia.

Among the present board of trus-
tees of the University, there are
11 of the fifteen members in Who's
Who.

Three board members are Phi
Beta Kappa key holders, eight
earned advanced degrees, seven hold
law degrees, eight are entitled to be
called doctors, either by honorary
degree or regular academic achieve-
ment, and one is an ex-governor.

A Few of the Best

As an introduction to the out-
standing alumni of Washington and
Lee, the Ring-tum Phi staff has
picked just a few men we feel are
representative.

The list is not intended to be
all inclusive, or in any order of
importance. The men were chosen at
random, and will serve our purpose
of pointing out the large number
of successful persons who are alum-
ni of Washington and Lee.

Among the top graduates of W&L
are:

Daniel Blain, Sr., class of 1921,
received his M.D. from Vanderbilt
and is presently Director of Mental
Hygiene of California. He is listed in
Who's Who, is a fifth or sixth gen-
eration W&L student, and is former
head of the department of psychiatry
at Georgetown University.

William Wallace Barron received
his B.A. degree from W&L in 1934,
He is the present governor of West

 

 

Virginia. Before his election to the
gubernatorial post, he was_ state
Attorney General for West Virginia.

Homer Adam Holt graduated with
a B.A. from W&L in 1918, was an
instructor here in mathematics
1920-23, and got his LL.B. in 1923.
He is listed in Who’s Who, is a Phi
Beta Kappa, and was governor of
West Virginia in 1937-41, before
which time he was Attorney General
of the state.

He has been General Counsel of
Union Carbide since 1947, serving as
its director from 1944-55, and has
been on the Board of Trustees of
Washington and Lee since 1940.

Christopher Tompkins Chenery,
class of 1909, is chairman of the
board of Southern Natural Gas
Corporation, a Phi Beta Kappa,
Omicron Dela Kappa, Who's Who,
chairman of Air Reduction Company
and Offshore Company, and a trus-
tee of Washington and Lee.

Master of “The Meadow”

Chenery is master of T“he Mead--
ow,” a famous and successful horse
racing stable. He owns First Land-
ing and Sir Gaylord, two horses
which have brought in purses total-
ling over $1 and a half million.

These men are only four examples.
There are 1,000 other Washington
and Lee alumni who rank with them.

And in the coming weeks, you will
read about those 1,000 alumni—the
men who have made the phrase,
“Washington and Lee men” a thing
of merit.

New Dictionary
Based On Usage,

Not Correctness

By BOB PATTON

How many times have you written
good quizzes and papers only to
have your grade docked for using
common, every day evpressions?

When you use words _ such
as “corny,” “wise guy, “hepped
up,” or “ants in his pants,’ your
teacher grumbled about your form-
al education and promptly racked
your grade a few notches.

How many times hove you wished
for a common man’s dictionary to
shove in your teacher's face and
say, “Here it is sir, this word is in
the dictionary. You’re wrong; I'm
right.”

Dr. Fitzgerald Flournoy Washing-
ton and Lee English professor dis-
cused such a dictionary at Mary
Baldwin College over the weekend.
The dictionary is the Webster's
Third International Dictionary, un-
abridged.

In this new kind of dictionary,
common usage determines whether
a word is acceptable or not. Dr.
Flournoy said that the New Web-
ster’s Third sparingly uses the labels
“colloquial” and “slang.”

According to Dr. Flournoy, the
editors of the New Webster Third
felt that what one man says is as
good as the next, and no one small
body of elite scholars has the right
to determine what is or is not ac-
cepted standard English.

It is interesting to predict what
effect this dictionary may have on
English usage. Students could start
using this dictionary to justify the
usage of certain words and grammar.

In addition to Shakespeare and
other notables of the language field
Dr. Flournoy said Wegster’s Third
quotes as authorities such per-
sonalities as Billy Rose, a notor-
ious night club owner; the St.
Petersburg Independent; TV person-
ality Art Linkletter; Bennet Cerf;
and United States senators to illus-
trate the validity of a word’s accept-
ance as standard English.

As long as a word is used fre-

quently in speaking, you can—ac-
cording to Webster's Third—use it in
writing.
To exemplify what can be stated
correctly using Webster’s Third as a
guide, the New York Times pub-
lished the following:

A passel of double-domes at the
G. and C. Merrian Company joint
in Springfield, Massachusetts, have
been confabbing and quakking for
27 years which is not intended to
infer that they have not been
doing plenty of work and now they
finalize Webster's New Interna-
tional Dictionary, Unabridged, a
new edition of that swell and es-
teemed book.

How does the dictionary
some of its words? A passel is “a
large number of low heads.” Double-

‘Inherit the Wind’ Loosened
Buckle On The ‘Bible Belt’

By C. C. FLIPPEN

The buckle on the Bible belt was
undone at the Troubadour Theatre
last week.

For a few hours the Bible-eating
citizens of Hillsboro, Tenn., had
their minds open and a little oil
from the lamp of truth forceably
poured in. Most of them didn’t like
the feel of rusty gears stirring.

A little of that oil might have
spilled over into the receptive au-
dience who saw the Troubs per-
form “Inherit the Wind” here.

The cast for the humorously poig-
nant play was well chosen.

Tim Morton, as Henry Drummond,
lawyer for the defense, dominated
the stage. With his head darting
in and out like a hungry chicken,
he constantly pecked away at the
ingrained dogma of the community.
Morton's ability to create characters
of depth and believability mark him
a top amateur actor.

As Matthew Harrison Brady, Gay
Reading has attempted to create a
role of a brilliant old man who
forgot the world and its ideas are
constantly in motion. For the most
part Reading has done a good job.
But the slight vocal affectation he
adopted in this role tended to affect
belief in his character.

John Dunnell as the sharp-tongued |
journalist Hornbeck has also done’

 

an effective job. He remained a bit-
ing cynic from start to finish. How-
ever, the authors leave him a much
more unpalatable character at the
end than we first thought him.

The supporting players were on
the whole adequate. Standout
among them was Bob Aylin as
Howard. His creation of an amus-
ing 13-year-old boy was very well
received.

Cates by Nick Denton, Rachel by
Ellen Barrett, Rev. Brown by Phil
Booth and Meeker by Andy Leonard
were also rather well done.

On the whole the production, di-
rected by Dr. Cecil Jones, was
very good. Occasionally in the early
scenes some lines seemed to be
rushed. Particularly noticeable was
an early crowd scene where the
eadence of line delivery sounded
distinctly like the clickty-clack train
ride song in “Music Man.”

Direction of the crowd scenes was
excellent. That so many people could
be worked well on the none-too-
large Troub stage is noteworthy.
When one considers that even this
area was lessened by having the
stage split into two separate act-
ing areas, it becomes almost astound-
ing.

Set and prop design were also
handled most effectively. The two-
level stage proved an integral part
of the show.

Generals Slip Past Centre, 38-22; Will Sewanee Be Next?

Kentucky Boys Shine At Home

   

Sewanee’s Tigers are stalking for their favorite
dish—raw General.

The Tigers from Tennessee invade Wilson Field
this Saturday with two purposes in mind: beat Wash-
ington and Lee and win the College Athletic Confer-
ence championship.

Some people thought Sewanee would be looking
ahead to this Saturday’s clash with W&L when they
met Southwestern last Saturday. If the Tigers were
dreaming of a feast and a plush throne room, Wash-
ington and Lee had better watch out .

Not only did Sewanee post its fourth win in six
games but it also ran up its biggest points spread of
the season—44-0.

Sewanee, led by junior tailback M. L. Agnew, had
trouble with Centre two weeks ago, posting a 28-6
win, but Southwestern seemed like easy pickings for
the hungry Tigers.

; = Tigers Sharpen Their Claws|
In Preparation For Clash With WGL |

Through the games of October 27 Agnew led the

yards), and total offense (710 yards) and was third
in scoring with 26 points.

Washington and Lee, launching its
drive to the College Athletic Confer-
ence title, wobbled by Centre Col-

lege, 38-22, Saturday at Danville,
Ky.
The Generals, obviously _ tired

from a 14-hour bus trip, looked slop-
py on offense, but still managed six
touchdowns, 371 yards rushing, and
46 yards passing.

Centre put on a surprising show
for a winless team and would have
made the score much closer had not
halfback Bill David intercepted a
Bill Hourigan pass on the Washing-
ton and Lee 10 as the game ended.

Although he did not score a touch-
down, Halfback Stu Yoffe led the
Generals’ ground attack with 151
yards in 10 carries. Quarterback
Chuck Lane picked up 60 yards in
11 tries, halfback Skip Chase dashed
for 55 yards in eight runs and
fullback Tommy Keesee earned 31
yards in eight attempts.

Washington and Lee drove 57 and
74 yards for tallies in the first two
times it had the football, but Centre

-| sandwiched a touchdown in between

the Generals scores, making W&L’s
margin only 12- “6.

GLOOM AT THE TOP

Oh, sure, you’ve been busy, what with going to classes, doing
your homework, catching night crawlers, getting married —
but can’t you pause for just a moment and give thought to that
dear, dedicated, lonely man in the big white house on the hill?
I refer, of course, to the Prexy.

(It is interesting to note here that college presidents are al-
ways called “Prexy.” Similarly, trustees are called ‘“Trixie.”
Associate professors are called “Axy-Pixy.” Bursars are called
“Foxy-Woxy.” Students are called “Algae.’’)

But I digress. We were speaking of the Prexy, a personage at
once august and pathetic. Why pathetic? Well sir, consider how
Prexy spends his days. He is busy, busy, busy. He talks to
deans, he talks to professors, he talks to trusteees, he talks to
alumni. In fact, he talks to everybody except the one group
who could lift his heart and rally his spirits. I mean, of course,
the appealingest, endearingest, winsomest group in the entire
college—you, the students.

It is the Prexy’s sad fate to be forever a stranger to your
laughing, golden selves. He can only gaze wistfully out the
window of his big white house on the hill and watch you at your
games and sports and yearn with all his tormented heart to bask
in your warmth. But how? It would hardly be fitting for Prexy
to appear one day at the Union, clad in an old rowing blazer,
and ery gaily, ‘““Heigh-ho, chaps! Who’s for sculling?”

 

No, friends, Prexy can’t get to you. It is up to you to get to
him. Call on him at home. Just drop in unannounced. He will
naturally be a little shy at first, so you must put him at his
ease. Shout, ‘‘Howdy-doody, sir! I have come to bring a little
sunshine into your drear and blighted life!’ Then yank his
necktie out of his vest and scamper goatlike around him until
he is laughing merrily along with you.

Then hand him a package and say, “A little gift for you, sir.”

“For me?’’ he will say, lowering his lids. “You shouldn’t
have.”

“Yes, I should,” you will say, “because this package is
a carton of Marlboro Cigarettes, and whenever I think of
Marlboro, I think of you.”

“Why, hey?” he will say curiously.

“Because Marlboros have taste, and so do you,”
reply.

“Aw, go on,” he will say, blushing furiously.

“Tt’s true,” you will say. “Moreover, Marlboro has a filter,
and so do you.”

“In my swimming pool, you mean,”

Yes,” you will say. “
and so do you.”

“My limp leather brief case, you mean,”

“Yes,” you will say. ‘‘Moreover, the
flip-top, and so do you.”

“But I don’t have a flip-top,” he will say.
“But you will,” you will say. “Just light a Marlboro, and
taste that tasty taste, and you will surely flip your top.”

Well sir, you will have many a good chuckle about that, you
may be sure. Then you will say, ‘Goodbye, sir, I will return
soon again to brighten your lorn and desperate life.”’

“Please do,” he will say. “But next time, if you can possibly
manage it, try not to come at four in the morning.”

Assistant Managing Editor

Fancy Dress, which annually marks the highlight of the

‘ university’s social life, should

this year be taking on even

larger dimensions than ever before.
Fortified with lavish funds saved from Openings, the

Receives First

Exactly one hundred and twenty
years ago a figure of wood made
in a workshop somewhere in Lex-
ington was unceremoniously “un-
veiled” by a _ group of students
who dragged it by rope to the top
of Washington Hall and placed it
in the cupola. Today the statute
is reveringly known as “Old
George” and is a_ well-known
landmark in our country.

In 1842, Captain Walker Kahler,
a cabinet maker and resident of
Lexington, cut down a huge White
Pine from the area where Buena
Vista now stands, brought it back
to his shop and, with the aid of
a few portraits and medallions, pro-

ceeded to sculpture George. The
statue shows fine workmanship
and from all accounts is a fair

likeness. The figure is dressed in
a toga which partially hides its
military dress. In one hand is
a scroll and in the other, a sword.
The statue stands 8 feet 4 inches
high and yet contains minute fea-
tures as fingernails and wrinkles,
delicate ears and hair. The detail
is fairly remarkable, and even more’
so when one realizes that Kahle}
used only an axe, foot-adze, a draw |
knife, and a few chisles.

Strangely enough though the only
mention of the statue in any of the |
College’s old records is from the|
context of a Board of Directors’
meeting which merely gvies per-|
mission for the statue to be placed |
in the cupola. The fact is that the}
cost of the statue, which was around |
$100, was raised by a subscription |
of the townspeople. Who conceived
the idea and those who paid for
is was never mentioned. Tody the |
statue stands somewhat unsteadily
in its same spot badly eaten away |
by time. The workers must repair
it up there because they’re afraid
it will break apart if moved. There
is a rotten hole in the statue’s side |
and the inside is now almost com-
pletely eaten out. The hollow in-
terior is being filled in by gluing
small wood blocks onto others.
Fortunately, the outside features
need little or no repair. One pleat
in the robe must be replaced, but
the hands and face are in decent
condition. What was _ originally
planned was to cover the statue in
a fiberglass coat. But this would
hide the equisite detail of the
statue. It was finally decided to
spray on a much thinner coat of
plastic material, which will have to
be renewed from time to time. In
any case after this major overhaul,
further deterioration of “Old
George”” is highly unlikely for a
long time to come.

——* Dance Board is going all out to make

the 1963 Fancy Dress an unforget-
table one for years to come.

“The entertainment promises to
be some of the most high-powered
W&L has seen in a long time,” com-
mented FD President Ham Emory.

Helping to insure the weekend's
success, Emory added, will be sev-
eral important innovations which the
Dance Board is planning to make.
These will include revisions in both
the cocktail party and the evening
dance.

Emory, a Phi Kap senior from
Virginia Beach, Va., has also an-
nounced his six vice-presidents:

Jim DeYoung, a Phi Kap sopho-
omore from Kenilworth, Ill., will be
in charge of decorations. DeYoung
is a house officer and is also on the
Ring-tum Phi, Southern Collegian,
and Varsity Tennis.

Ralph Wiegandt, a Phi Kap senior
from Williamstown, Mich., is in
charge of miscellaneous. Wiegandt is
president of his fraternity and a
member of Scabbard and Blade and
the “13” Club.

Andy Nea, a Phi Gam Senior from
Williamsburg, Va., is in charge of
publicity. Nea is Editor-in-Chief of
the Friday Ring-tum Phi.

Tom Woodward, a PiKA sopho-
more from SSuffolk, Va., is in charge
of invitations. Woodward is on the
Conservative Society and manager
of Varsity Basketball.

Doug Campbell, a Phi Kap senior
from Harlan, Ky., is in charge of
the cocktail party.

Lee Jeter, a Phi Gam Senior from
Altavista, Va., is in charge of the
figure. Jeter is on the Dean’s List
and a member of A.E.D.

Emory further stated that infor-
mation concerning costumes will be
released in the Ring-tum Phi next
week,

The Fancy Dress Ball will take
place Friday evening in the Com-
mons. Providing the souds will be
Count Basie and his orchestra and
the Tiger Town Five.

The Dance Board has selected
the “Civil War” as the theme of
the dance. Frank Young, President
of the Dance Board, stated that
students will not have to rent cos-
tumes for their dates since formal
evening gowns will be appropriate.

Law Student Recounts Summer
At Guantanamo Naval Station

With the peak of the Cuban crisis
passed, relief has become com-
pounded with confusion as negotia-
tions for denuclearization go into
the first stages. One of the centers
of dispute is the leased U.S. Naval
Base at Guantanamo Bay in east-
ern Cuba. Castro, in his recent at-
tempts to snarl the dismantling
procedures, demanded the evacua-
tion of this base as one of the
prerequisites for his cooperation in

 

these matters. Guantanamo has been

a focal point throughout the crisis;
it was off limits to U.S. newsmen
until last Wednesday.

Jim Howe, a second semester sen-
ior law student, spent a part of last
summer in Guantanamo as a pilot
and Maintenance Officer in the

rough, station about twenty miles
square. It is overgrown with cactus
and surrounded by a barbed wire
fence twenty-five miles long. Out-
side of the fence there are Cuban
troops dug in and apparently ready
to fight, though nothing ever hap-
pens.

Isolated

In spite of the rough terrain, it
is a comfortable base; there are
adequate recreational facilities, in-
cluding six outdoor movies, skin
diving, fishing, and sailboating, which
Jim took advantage of during his
stay there. “Guantanamo is a very
isolated base,’ he explained. “When
I was there earlier, we were allowed
to go off limits and take trips to
Guantanamo City, where we saw
Batista’s men walking around with
guns and bullet holes in many of
the walls. Havana is about 400
miles away, and with the new re-
gieme, everyone must stay on base.
They try to take your mind off the
isolation by giving you lots of re-
creation.” He added that besides the
restriction to the base, there were
no apparent changes since his earlier
stay.

Two Groups

Jim divides the thousand or so
Cubans who work on base into two

those who live off base and com-
mute by buses. “The ones who stay
on base are very anti-Castro and
very afraid to go back,” he re-
marked. “I’m sure that many of them
were involved in the revolution. The
others don’t care. On payday Castro
agents stop the buses outside of the
fence and make them get off. They
cash their paychecks for them, turn-
ing them into Cuban currency—and
incidentally keeping a portion for
themselves. The workers don’t com-
plain.”

Water Supply

In regard to the current situation,
Jim said that there was no indi-
cation of the missile buildup, either
through official sources or rumor.
He gave his own opinion as to why
the dependents were evacuated
when the crisis broke; “The water
supply is off base, and Castro cut
it off when Kennedy made his an-
nouncement. The base depends on
this and it was probably the primary
reason why the dependents were
brought back.” They were given
permission on Wednesday to talk
about events at the base; previously,
the dependents were not allowed to
reveal anything about Cuba at all.

Academic Waste: Do Grades Represent Pupil’s Talent ?

This week marks the conclusion of the Atlantic
Monthly article “Are Colleges Killing Education?”
The article, written by Oscar Handlin, has served
as the introduction to the new Friday Edition
series Symposia...

I speak now of the reconciled mass who somehow
make their peace with the system, but of the ablest,
among whom the qualities of excellence might be
be found. These young people secure an admirable
training in the techniques of the correct answer. They
learn to remember; to be accurate, neat, and cautious.
But they are rarely called on to use their ability
autonomously or speculatively, to deal with situations
in which the answers are not known but must be
discovered.

They cannot afford the sense of the tentativeness of
knowledge, of the imperfection of existing formula-
tions. Writing against the clock, they must always put
the the cross in the right box and round out the essay
with an affirmative conclusion. With what pain, if ever
at all, will they learn how to know what do not know,
how to probe alone beyond the limits of what is
handed to them, how to be creative original thinkers.
By the time they carry their diplomas away, they will
have missed an education—that experience which, by
the exposure of one’s mind to the thinking of others,
creates not answers but a lifetime of questions.

We are all sufferers by the loss sustained by this
generation of students. An open society like our
own depends in large measure upon the educa-
tional system to evaluate those who pass through
it and to channel them into the proper places in
life. If the colleges fail in the process of selection,
the young people with the appropriate talents will
not become the doctors and teachers, the diplomats
and businessmen, the physicists and engineers they
should be. When the pegs do not fit the holes, the
structure creaks.

Undue emphasis upon performance measured by col-
lege may have precisely that effect. These scores have
only a slight predictive value and are unlikely to
furnish reliable indications of future achievements.
I do not mean that high-ranking students do worse
than law-ranking ones. As a group, they do better.
But in the long run, not all A students do as well as
they should, and not all do better than B students;
there are enough dramatic reversals of form to raise
doubts about excessive reliance upon these standards.
Every teacher has seen the slow starter work at his
own pace, then suddenly discover himself and out-
distance the front-runners.

We organize the boys and girls in classes and treat
them as anonymous integers in an elaborate record
system. Yet we know that each is an_ individual
different from every other. Each has his own way of
learning. To pretend that all can be classified and
graded on the identical scale denies those differences
and does violence to reality. Above all, it puts a prem-
iuum on malleability, upon accommodation to existing
expectations, upon the qualities of getting along. The
good boy is he who matches up to his teachers’ pre-
viously formed standards. But is he the one likely to
grow into the man of achievement?

Unless he learns somehow to locate himself by
his own standards, a blast of awareness, in school
or later, will blow him off his course. My room-
mate, said the boy who was my tutee, was good
at everything; there was not a blemish on the
record at commencement. In his senior year, my
roommate took the aptitude tesis in business,
medicine, and law, did very well in all, and as a

matter of course entered the law school, having
done best in that subject. No doubt he would have
been at the head of the pack in that race also,
but in an unguarded moment my roommate al-
lowed himself to wonder what being a lawyer
would mean to him. He did not know the answer.
He did not even know how to go about finding
the answer.

In the past, the looseness and inefficiency of the
educational system provided the means for rescuing
talent in danger of being wasted. The boy whose
interests matured late or changed as he grew up
could jog along at his own rate and make up for
lost time when he was ready. But the more rigid
the system becomes, the less room it leaves for
the varient patterns of the maverick. The species,
indeed, becomes ever less likely to appear, as the habit
or desire for nonconformity is stifled. The student
totally absorbed in the race loses confidence in him-
self and accepts the premature rating as a_ valid
measure of his ability. Then the evaluation becomes
self-fulfilling. Placidly the young man tells me he
would like to be a historian, and will if he earns a
magna. If he gets only a cum, he will go into his
father’s laundry business. Life becomes a play in which
the first act determines the outcome of the plot.

As a result many of the most sensitive youngsters
simply throw up their hands. They turn their backs on
the whole process and all too often reject the values
attached to the college. They hasten into marriage,
seeking in life the reality and personal security school
does not afford them. Or they simply refuse to finish;
increasingly, the able students are among those who
leave before graduation. The stronger or more stub-
born ones stick it out for the sheepskin; the weaker
or more reflective ones break down or pull out—in
either case, a tragic waste of talent. For they were all
good when they got to college (otherwise they would
not have been admitted), and the failure is not alto-
gether theirs.

There was a boy who had been at Harvard only
one year, As a freshman in a smaller college he
had done so well, and his high school record had
been so good, that he had been encouraged to
transfer, and a scholarship had enabled him to do
so. After two semesters he was defeated and re-
fused to go on. In the interminable calculation
of pluses and minuses, he felt he was in danger
of losing sight of what he had come for, and he
wished to leave college to be educated. This is
the stuff beats are made of. Such people do better
to preserve their authenticity as persons by going
away or by abstracting themselves from the rou-
tine rather than by yielding to the pressures. Yet
the college loses by the inability to influence—
and be influenced by—them.

She is a junior of about twenty, neat and not bad-
looking; nothing distinguishes her in the rows of note-
takers in the lecture hall. Now she has found the
excuse for a conference in some question about the
reading. She talks nevrously about what is not on her
mind and then she blurts out what is. She will not
be back to finish next year. She has taken a librarian’s
job in Georgia, in a small town, where she will be
useful. Why? Nothing here seems to be worth doing
the courses she takes are all right, but she gets only
B’s in them. She has studied bits of philosophy and

SYMPOSIA...

 
   

bits of government, and she is interested in the re-
lations of ethics to politics. As she talks, life comes
back to her voice and the words tumble out fluently.
Well, why not go on with the subject next year?
It will not make a manageable thesis. It has not oc-
curred to her that one could learn outside the frame-
work of the requirements.
cS ae *

The system favors certain character types over
others, and not always the most desirable ones. For
the young man who knows when he enters that he
will be an actuary or a geologist or a patent attorney,
the learning track runs clearly to his destination and
all the stations are plainly marked. He will make few
mistakes and run few risks. Even if he is not altogether
docile, he operates within a limited framework and
wastes no time. His schooling is likely to be unevent-
ful; it may also be unadventurous and unimproving.

By contrast, those who come to college without
specifically defined goals or who change as they learn
are at a competitive disadvantage. They must make
choices along the whole route, and therefore face the
hazard of mistaken decisions. They are prone to turn
into dead ends and to need second chances. Since
what is relevant to their needs is not already marked
out for them, they may gain more from looking out
of the windows than from taking notes. Their records
will look spotty and erratic. Yet they may be growing
at every stage and may, in the end, be the better for
their mistakes than their fellows who never faltered
Society may be the loser by the failure to make room
for the recovery of such talents. We need not only
men who can get the job done, but also those who
can wonder why it needs to be done.

Under the pressure of unremitting competition,
a valuable sector of the educational enterprise
shows signs of contraction. Since the measured
blocks and units of formal instruction have clearly
defined weight, it is foolhardy to expend precious
energies upon activities to which no immediate
reward is attached. Those who waste time by the
way will lose ground in the race to the “bookers”
who concentrate on the assignments. The ten-
dency to shy away from distraction is recent and
has not gone far, but it is already ominous.

Not all learning in the college community of the
past was confined to the classroom. Often the students
taught each other more effectively than the teachers
could, gained more from extracurricular activities than
from formal classwork. The experience of writing for
the paper, or managing a team, or of singing or
playing, and, most of all, the undirected talk that
swirled formlessly through the night have a value
that cannot be recognized in grades or credits. There
will be ever less time for them as the shadow of
the examination fall across the college. Boys made
rivals by competition will be less ready to help one
another, and the immensely variegated activities of
the college as it was may dry up.

Finally, the whole process thrusts an uncongenial
role upon the instructor. His function as a teacher
becomes subsidiary to that of the grader; he is judge
rather than counselor, impartial arbiter rather than
ally of the student. That, too, distorts the meaning
of education. It destroys the intimacy of a relation-
ship in which the older person conceives his role as
that of helping the younger, in which the younger

   

can turn to the older for aid and advice without fear
of being evaluated in the process.
‘ss
There is no simple corrective to this disorder,

even were its nature clearly perceived. Much of
the difficulty springs from the unprecedented de-
mands a democratic society places upon the col-
lege. We cannot and should not halt the increas-
ing size of student bodies. We need more rather
than fewer fellowships. And college should con-
tine to play a part in career selection. These are
conditions of the value we place upon the equality
of opportunity, Only thus can we locate ability
wherever it may be found and compensate for
the ineaqualities of family background. Yet, to the
degree that we encourage these desirable trends,
our institutions will become more formal, more
bureaucratic, and more rigidly organized.

But we need not, in consequence, continue to en-
cumber ourselves with outmoded methods of evalua-
tion which frustrate the larger goals of education.

I tease myself sometimes with daydreams of how
we might break out of the present situation. A few
institutions have already separated the teaching and
the marking functions. That is as it should be, and the
result is to clarify the relationship of the teacher to
his students. It would be gratifying te appear in a
classroom where everyone was on the same side,
where there was not one to police and the others to
be policed, but all were to work toward the same end.
Evidence points to the merits of a divorce between
the essentially incompatible tasks of instructor and
grader.

That separation of tacks would, of course, make
it impossible to administer examinations and award
marks for every segment of instruction. So much
the better. No other system of higher education
subjects its students to the endlessly badgering
tests of the American college. The examinations
of French and English universities are difficult,
but they come where they belong, at the terminus
of a stage in education, And they probe not frag-
ments of courses, but the mastery of a whole field
of knowledge, and however and whenever ac-
quired, These methods cannot be simply transfer-
red to our own institutions. But they indicate
that we can safely do without the recurrent, mean-
ingless hurdles we now set in the way of our stu-
dents. We can aim at a mode of evaluation that
will judge the whole man as he leaves the campus,
not the bits and pieces of him we glimpse as he
passes through it.

Above all, we can take the heat off by leaving
these people alone. Most college freshmen are now
eighteen years old. They are men and women who
are, or should be, above all concerned with discover-
ing themselves. All these prescriptions and require-
ments, all those efforts at surveillance and discipline,
obscure the true nature of their tasks. They must
learn after their own fashion, even at the cost of
false starts, errors, and lost time. The college can
help them, if they wish to be helped, mostly by creat-
ing an environment for discovery. The faculty can
help them, if they wish to be helped, mostly through
establishing the contacts, fruitful when free, of the
more, with the less, experienced minds. But the stifling
competitive atmosphere of the race for position, which
the college itself generates by anachronistic grading
methods, has no place in that environment.

W&L Set For CAC Victory

Sewanee Challenges
As W&L Seeks
Conference Victory
A showdown battle for the foot-
ball championship of the College
Athletic Conference is on tap this
Saturday at Wilson Field, when
Washington and Lee University

plays host to Sewanee.

The Sewanee Tigers, 2-0 in the
conference and 4-1-1 overall, can
clinch the title by beating the
Generals and thus become the first

member of the new athletic con-
ference to win a championship.

A Tiger victory would also mean
an important leg on the overall
conference trophy—a_ giant 300-
pound locomotive bell — that
will go to the conference member
compiling the best records in six
league sports during the year.

The Generals, sporting a 1-0 con-|
ference mark and a handsome 6-1

record against all comers, can spoil
Sewanee’s bid, but in order to win
the conference laurels, they still
need to defeat Southwestern at
Memphis the following week.

The Sewanee-W&L clash rates
as a toss-up, although the Tigers
have mauled three common op-
ponents by more convincing mar-
gins. Both teams boast potent,
swift-striking backfields and mo-
bile, hard-charging lines. Sewanee
was tied in its opener by Millsaps,
and lost to Austin by a 10-7 mar-
gin. W&L had its 21-game un-
beaten string ended by Emory and
Henry, 38-33, but since then has
won four more,

Saturday’s game will match some
of the conference’s statistical lead-
ers, although Sewanee’s great tail-
back, M. L. Agnew, will likely
retain his total offense leadership,
ho matter how the game goes. The
190-pound junior has ground out
456 yards rushing and passed for
347 more to lead the league with 803
yards. Agnew has scored 32 points
on five touchdowns and a conver-
sion run, and he has passed for
four other touchdowns,

Washington and Lee’s chief of-
fensive threats are junior half-

 

 

Bell Trophy for Conference Winner

 

Tennis Tournament
Ends As Dickinson
Wins 6-3, 6-4 Game

The University Fall Tennis Tour-
nament came to an exciting end
this week with freshman Forest
Dickinson defeating sophomore Fred
Webb, 6-3, 6-4, in a match which
saw the lead change several times.

The trophy, an annual revolv-
ing award, is presented by Thomas
Limited. Dickinson will retain the
trophy for the rest of the year—
not being eligible for competition
next year.

Tennis coach Bill Washburn ex-
pressed satisfaction with the tour-
nament, pointing out that Dickin-
son had bested an original field of
48 contestants, upperclassmen and

 

freshmen. He also stated that some |

of the match play showed definite
potential for the varsity and fresh-
man tennis squads which get under-
way in earnest next March.

 

back Stuart Yoffe and senior full-
back Tommy Keesee. Yoffe has
averaged 8.6 yards a carry in
amassing a 440-yard rushing total,
while Keesee has carried 70 times
for 395 yards and a 5.6 average.
Although the Generals seldom
pass, Keesee did once and it
netted a 27-yard touchdown strike.

Last year, W&L won over Se-
wanee, 26-8, in the Generals’ tough-
est game.

 

Generals Defeat Guilford
In Second Half Rally

The Washington and Lee soccer
team played a sluggish first half
but sprang to life in the second to
shut out Giulford College, 3-0,
Wednesday.

With the Generals’ defense play-
ing a tight game throughout the
day, the slow-starting forward line
finally scored in the early part of
the second half. Freshman Tim
Henry took advantage of a Cuilford
miss-kick and drove the loose ball
home for the score. Halfback Bruce
Jackson then scored on an assist
by captain Bob Pagano with Henry
following with his second score and

Frosh Tankmen Show Early Power

As VMI Falls In Practice Meet

The Washington and Lee fresh-
man swimming team showed flashes
of power Thursday as they defeated
the VMI rats 53-42 in a practice
meet.

Outstanding Performers

Coach Norris Eastman cited Lee
Johnson (first place in the 200-yard
freestyle in 2.24.1, Bo Bokinsky (first
in the 200-yard breaststroke and
second in the 200-yard individual
medley), and Don Casto (first in the
90-yard and 100-yard freestyle
events with times of 25.4 and 58.7),
was especially strong for so early in
the season.

The 200-yard individual medley
was particularly outstanding with
the first three men separated by
only a single second, the Gener-
als capturing the last two places.

 

The varsity team will make their
first appearance in a practice meet
against VMI Wednesday in the VMI
pool.

Both varsity and freshman have
spent the days since the season
opened on November 1 in a period
coach Eastman laughingly calls,
“animal week.” He has confidence
that both teams will be in top
shape for their opening meets in
early December.

Aggressive And Consistent Play
Rates Athlete Of The Week

Bruce Jackson has been chosen
by the Washington and Lee coach-
ing staff as this
week’s “athlete of
the week” for his
outstanding play
as the soccer team
shut out Guil-
ford, 3-0.

In the left half-
back slot, Bruce
demonstrated fine
defensive and of-
fensive play
: throughout the
Jackson game, and high-
lighted his performance by scoring
a goal in the fourth quarter.

Coach Lyles especially noted the

value of Jackson’s heading as one
of the keys to his play-breaking

 

ability. Lyles cited Jackson’s block-
ing of an indirect kick by Guilford
as the “saver of a shutout” for the
Generals.

Offensively throughout the sea-
son Jackson has been instrumental
in setting up the wings, Hibbard
and Busse. Bruce is credited with
five assists so far this season.

Lyles says that Jackson gives
confidence to both the linemen and
the backs with his controlling play.
The fullbacks are able to give in
and commit themselves because they
are sure that Bruce will be there if
they miss the offensive man.

Jackson has more playing time
this year than any other member
of the soccer squad, which reflects
his value to the team and excellent
physical conditioning.

Scholarship

For Service
To Be Given

A perpetual scholarship to
be awarded for distinctive stu-
dent service to the university
will be established by the
Executive Committee, it was

announced today.

The scholarship, provided by the
investment of funds owned by the
student body, will be given annually.
The amount of the award will vary
from $100 to $250 according to the
need of the recipient.

The EC, however, stressed the
fact that the award will not be
made on the basis of need, as are
most university scholarships. The
winner will be chosen entirely on
service to the school, in the fields of
student government, publications, or
any other.

The award will probably be made
at the end of the winner’s junior
year, although the final decision on
this and other details have not
been made as yet. The Executive
Committee will choose each year’s
recipient.

A name for the award has not
been announced, but it is expected
that the name will be chosen and
final plans set up next week.

Student Funds Show Profit

The award stipend will be drawn
from the same fund which provides
operating expenses for the EC each
year. This fund has been invested
over the years by the Rockbridge
National Bank, under the guidance
of Sam Rayder, student body treas-
Interest from the fund now

provides a surplus of around $250
annually.

After conferences with Rayder,

the EC decided to use this money to
establish the award.

EC president Tim Ireland said
the purpose of the award was to
“offer some mode of recognition to
students who have performed dis-
tinetive service to the university.”

 

Dance Board
Sues McPhatter
For Damages

Clyde McPhatter, who failed to
appear for Openings Concert, is be-
ing sued for breach of contract by
agents of the W&L Dance Board.

McPhatter has stated that he was
unable to appear at the concert
because his plane could not land; he
says the breach was unavoidable.
However, suit is being brought
against him for damages of about
$500.

The Dance Board losses stem from
payment for sound equipment which
had been placed in the gym, and
from losses in Dance Plan sales re-
sulting from the incident.

Board President Frank Young said
that nothing in the way of harsh
feelings has passed between repre-
sentatives of the university and the
entertainer. He does not expect the
suit to result in a total victory for his
agents, but hopes for a verdict giving

the Board at least partial considera-!

tion.

NEWS BRIEFS

 

U.Va. Adopts Changes Recommended by Ring-tum Phi

The University of Virginia has instituted the same change in its final
examination schedule which was used as a model for the suggested change
in our own schedule (see editorial, page 2). In light of the fact that some
students were dealt fatal academic blows by cramped exam schedules, the
University of Virginia has initiated three steps to facilitate study before
exams. They are that (1) no roll will be taken during the two days prior
to exams in any class, and (2) no quizzes will be given during regular
class hours of these last two days, and (3) no new work will be assigned.

The object of this is to allow students who have exams during the
first few days of the schedule to prepare properly for their exams. A
discussion of how this might be adopted to the W&L system may be

found in our editorial this week.

EC Plans To Abolish Option;
_ Student Body Opinions Sought

Dangers Of ‘Escape Clause’ Cited;
hae Seen As Non-Existent
By RUSTY RYLAND

The Executive Committee announced today that it favors
doing away with the present option clause in Honor System
procedure as a “measure of further protection to all students.”

President Tim Ireland said that the proposal had the ini-
tial support of the EC, and that Ed Holmes, Bill Boardman,

and Bob Payne had been appoint-*———
ed to make the necessary adjust-
ments in Honor System procedure.

Text of the Statement
The EC statement reads as fol-
Discussion Invited lows:

Ireland also stated that the EC
had a desire for the expression of
opinion from the student body. He
requested that students discuss the
matter and make their opinions
known to the EC.

The

This statement is for the purpose
of acquainting the student body
with a course of action which is now
under the consideration of the Ex-
ecutive Committee.

It has been proposed that the
Executive Committee do away with
the right of an aceused to have an
option of voluntarily withdrawing
from the University rather than fac-
ing trial for an alleged violation of
the honor system.

 

Executive Committee state-
ment listed two main points as
major factors in the decision. First
the EC believes that the option
actually does not benefit the ac-
cused. Although the University
records will read that the student
voluntarily withdrew from the Uni-
versity, University officials are,
nevertheless, obliged to describe the
circumstances if any inquiry is
made by another institution.

An inquiry of this type is almost
always made, and thus the benefits
of the option are negligible.

has received the
initial approval of the Executive
Committee, and this statement is
being presented to the student body
so that the students of W&L will
have the opportunity to discuss the
proposal with members of the Ex-
ecutive Committee before a_ final
vote is taken, and so that the stu-
dents will be informed of the rea-
sons for the action if it is finally ap-
proved.

First, it is the feeling of the Com-
mittee that the option is deceiving
in that it leads a person accused of
an honor system violation to be-
lieve that it will be to his benefit
to take the option.

The proposal

Secondly, the EC is concerned
over the possibility of students ex-
ercising the option even when there
is doubt as to their guilt. “There-

to offer additional protection to the

has found that many students have
to be encouraged to accept the trial
even when there is doubt of their

of understanding as to what to ex-

in a trial, partly to the desire to
leave school with a clean record,
and partly to the ease with which
the option may be exercised.

Referring to the ROTC Depart-

An Exam Schedule Suggestion

Perhaps the matter of greatest concern to students and
faculty alike is that of final examinations. Students have to take
them; professors have to grade them. And a great thorn in the
sides of many students is that their exam schedule often puts
them at a great disadvantage.

At Washington and Lee, regular classes are held on the
day immediately preceding the first day of final examinations.
Many students have to worry about last week quizzes and heavy
assignments given by unorganized professors who are trying
to pack two weeks of subject matter into the last three class
periods.

As an example, it is possible for a student to have one
exam on the first day of the exam period, two on the following
day, and one on the day after that. No matter how persevering
a student may be during the semester, such an exam schedule
is too severe a physical and mental strain under which to oper-
ate successfully. High grades which have been sought after
and won all semester long are often lost during the three-hour
final exam simply because the student did not have the hours
in the day necessary for adequate review.

All of this must be considered in the light of the fact that
for many students at Washington and Lee, the process of edu-
cation is only beginning. Graduate school lies ahead, and the
competition for admission to the better schools is fierce. Ad-
mission to these schools is based on grades, recommendations,
and activities, usually in that order. The latter two categories
depend on the first. Recommendations are good or mediocre
depending on the student’s academic showing, and activities
can be pursued or left out depending on the student’s scholastic
success.

So much, therefore, depends on the grade which a student
receives in any class, that the school should make sure that
the student has every opportunity to earn the marks of which
he is capable. The exam schedule we describe in the third
paragraph would severely hamper any student’s preparation
and review for his exams.

The administration has considered the fact that exam
schedules can leave a student at a disadvantage, but it has
been unable to arrive at any solution. The school year cannot
be lengthened in order to allow a few days of grace before
exams begin. Academic calendars are made up years in ad-
vance. We have a solution, therefore, which would require
absolutely no change in the academic schedule. Under this
system, the only thing necessary is the cooperation of the
professors.

Our suggestion is drawn from an idea which the University
of Virginia is initiating this semester. At W&L exams begin
this year on Tuesday, January 22. The day before that is a
full day of classes. Saturday, January 19, is Founders Day,
a holiday. Classes are in session every day of the week before
this. In the second semester, exams begin on Saturday, May
25. Classes are in session right up until that day.

Our proposal sets forth three points. Two class periods
prior to exams, (1) no roll should be taken, (2) no quizzes
should be given during the regular class hour, and (3) no new
work should be assigned. In other words, during the four of
the six days preceding exams, regular classes would be con-
cerned only with review work aimed at clarifying weak points
encountered during the semester. Professors would have to
organize their semester so that they could allow for two days
review at the end. This is something which should be done
anyway, but a few professors assign quizzes and cover extensive
new material in the last three classes before exams.

More than one professor with whom we have talked be-
lieves that this problem is serious, and that the solution we
propose is sound. We shall be very disappointed if the faculty
does not give this proposal serious consideration in its next
meeting, and if the student body does not express itself to
individual professors in order that all professors may be
assured that the exam schedule problem is as serious as we
have stated above. This is a matter of crucial importance, which
should receive immediate and concentrated attention.

The proposal would have one distinct advantage: it would
require no juggling of the University calendar, and could
therefore be initiated with a minimum of difficulty. Further,
the two periods of review, if used properly, would provide the
professor an opportunity to clear up important points which,
without explanation, would require long hours of haphazard
study.

Letters
To The
Editor...

Mr. Timothy Ireland

Dear Tim:

The Faculty Library Committee
wishes to express its sincere appre-
ciation to you and to all members
of your Executive Committee for
your complete cooperation in mak-
ing clear to all the policy to be
followed concerning the wrongful
removal of books from McCormick
Library or any of the departmental
libraries. This is another illustration
of many that I have noted through
the years—of how Washington and
Lee student officers and students
take commendable action when they
fully realize the problem.

Perhaps one would have to attend
school where stacks are closed and
every book used has to be signed
out in order fully to understand the
value of our “open stack” system
and free use of books. To preserve
our library system it must be pro-
tected by all who benefit from it.

For various reasons the idea had
circulated that the wrongful removal
of books from our libraries could
not be treated as an honor system
case, that is, a case to be investi-
gated on possible charges of stealing.
The action of your Executive Com-
mittee will do more than anything
we know to show that the rumor is
wrong. Books are the most valuable
and indispensable things we use in
college, and to remove one contrary
to reasonable regulations is certainly
not honorable.

If you agree that I have correctly
summarized the meaning of the re-
cent action of your committee con-
cerning the wrongful removal of
books, may I have your permission
to send a copy of this letter to the
Ring-tum Phi?

Both editions of the student paper
have been most helpful in empha-
sizing and clarifying your action, and
we wish to express our sincere ap-
preciation to both editors: Landon
Butler and Andrew Nea.

Recent Election Triumphs Of Democrats
Don’t Point Out Popularity Of Kennedy

By JIM BRUTON

Although there was no discernible
pattern in last week’s national elec-
tions, the results showed some sig-
nificant developments. The Repub-
licans gained only two seats in the
House, and lost four in the Senate
(assuming that the Democrats main-
tain the lead in the still unde-
cided races). The Democrats now
have a majority of 259 members in
the House to the Republicans’ 176.
They lead in the Senate 68 to the
Republicans’ 32 members.

In holding intact its large majori-
ties in both houses, the Democratic
Party broke every precedent, since
it should have lost 20 to 40 seats
in off-year voting. This result has
strengthened the prestige of Presi-
dent Kennedy abroad, but does not
indicate domestic support of his pro-
grams.

In 1960, the Democrats lost 21
seats in the House in spite of na-
tional support for their Presidential
candidate. This year the Demo-
cratic Congress opposed President
Kennedy on many aspects of the
New Frontier. In recent elections
the Democrats lost only two seats.
JFK’s programs may have a rough
going-over in Congress next session.

Two Party Break Through

The voting throughout the nation
showed several interesting develop-
ments. The first of these is the
break-through of the two-party sys-
tem, especially in the South, and
the heated competition between the
two parties in all regions. The sec-
ond is the gradual loss of power
for the Republican Party, which
may have to undergo alteration in
the future. The third development
is the outcome of the gubernatorial
elections in key states which may
produce the Republican Presidential
candidate in 64.

Republicans with conservative
programs made dents in the South
by capturing new _ congressional
seats in Florida, Tennessee, and

 

North Carolina. In many _ other
closely contested districts voters
chose conservative Democrats, how-
ever, over conservative Republicans
largely because of party label. In
Alabama the liberal Senator Lister
Hill just narrowly defeated a Re-
publican. In Texas hopeful Repub-
liceans gained one rather than the
expected three additional seats.

Democrats in New England

The Democrats invaded areas of
New England where they had never
been heard of before. Republican
Governor John Reed closely squeez-
ed by his Democratic challenger in
Maine. Democratic Endicott Pea-
body won the Massachusetts gover-
norship, and Vermont elected a
Democratic governor for the first
time in 100 years.

In the Midwest, Republicans lost
veteran Indiana Senator Capehart,
who had demanded action on Cuba.
Republican Senator Alexander Wiley
was defeated in Wisconsin as was
Republican Representative Walter
Judd in Minnesota. Republican
James Rhodes defeated Mike DiSalle
in the Ohio gubernatorial race.

In the West, conservative Repub-
lican Dominick ousted liberal Demo-
crat John Carroll in Colorado. In
California, conservative Republicans
Rousselot and Hiestand, victims of
a fantastic redistricting scheme, were
defeated. As we all know, Richard
Nixon lost because of the dissatisfied
right wing in his own party and the
dissatisfied electorate in his own
state.

Conservatism in the South

The Republican success in Ken-
tucky and in areas further south
suggests that an all-out conserva-
tive drive would yield further
gains, at least in the South and
Southwest. In the _ industrialized
northern states, moderate to liberal
Republican candidates such as Rom-
ney, Scranton, and Rockefeller won
because they seemed liberal enough
to capture Democratic votes.

 

The elections showed the dilem-
ma that the Republicans face. They
must campaign on Conservative pro-
grams to win in the South and
Southwest. They must become more
liberal to win in the North. They
have to woo the liberal or con-
servative voters in both parts of
the country since the Democrats
outnumber the Republicans in regis-
tration.

The Republican Party will, there-
fore, have to decide whether to be-
come wholly liberal or wholly con-
servative, or else it will suffer a
split in ranks. One may ask why this
prediction is plausible if the Demo-
cratic Party, which also contains
conservative and liberal wings, has
managed to hold together. The an-
swer is that the Democratic organi-
zation has become so well entrench-
ed in this country since the New
Deal that it has maintained control
despite differences within.

The Democratic Image

Also, the Democrats have a tradi-
tional image of being able to pro-
duce more effective leaders, whether
liberal or conservative, than the
Republicans. The difference between
the two parties then is that the
Democratic is controlled more by
its liberal members and the Repub-
licans more by its conservatives. If
the Republican organization hopes
to strengthen itself, it must get off
the fence and turn either to the right
or to the left and then it must pro-
vide dynamic leadership in which-
ever course it takes.

That brings us to consider the
next G.O.P. presidendital candidate.
In the course of the next two years
barring a catstrophic upset such as
a depression, in which the people
would turn to new ideas (Goldwater
conservatism, for example)—barring
such an event, the G.O.P. is certain
to nominate a liberal in ’64. Since
the moderate type of Republican
(Nixon) is no longer around, and

MEN OF ACHIEVEMENT

 

Trustees Set the Pace for the Alumni

By TRACY HARRINGTON |

(This is the second in a series |
of articles in which the Tuesday
Ring-tum Phi is attempting to ac-
quaint the student body with W&L’s
Alumni.

We are greatly indebted to Pro-
fessor John Gunn for making the
series possible. Much of our infor-
mation was gathered by him, and
the conception of the series itself
was his idea.

Today we are presenting the Board
of Trustees of the University—Edi-
tor’s note.)

The Board of Trustees
The title of this series—Men of
Achievement—could well have been
chosen especially to describe the
Board of Trustees.
They are, in order:

 

A prominent attorney; a_ well |
known physician; a_ top-ranking |
theologian; former governor of!
West Virginia; chairman of the,
board of Lykes Brothers Steamship- |
Company, the largest shippers in the
world; president of Jewel Ridge |
Coal Co.; chairman of Southern |
Natural Gas Corp.; Supreme Court
of Appeals of Virginia justice;

An extremely successful cotton
broker; president of West Point
Manufacturing Company; Judge,
United States Court of Appeals for
Fifth Circuit; Mrs. duPont, an out-
standing business executive and
friend of education who has multi-
plied the estate of her late husband;

The proprietor of a large chain
of garages and parking lots (mil-
lions of dollars worth of them); pres-
ident of the Bank of Georgia; and
an outstanding attorney and partner
in the leading law firm in the state
of Virginia.

12 in Who's Who

Twelve out of the 15 of the trus-
tees are in Who's Who in America,

six are Phi Beta Kappa, one is
a Ph.D. and seven hold law de-
grees.

All of them are well-known in
their fields of endeavor, and nearly
all of them are exceptionally
wealthy.

The facts are impressive, but the
men themselves are even more so.
Noted Attorney
James Randolph Caskies graduat-
ed from Washington and Lee under-
graduate school in 1909 with a B.A.
degree. Three years later he earned
his LL.B. from the law school here.
Caskie, a member of Delta Tau

 

Delta, is a Phi Beta Kappa, and

one of the top attorney’s in the
state. He practices in Lynchburg.

James Morrison Hutcheson got
his B.A. degree here in 1902 and his
M.D. from the Medical College of
Virginia a few years later.

He is a Kappa Alpha and a Phi
Beta Kappa .

Hutcheson, a physician in Rich-
mond, is among Virginia’s top medi-
cal men .

John Newton Thomas got his
B.A. from W&L in 1924, and re-
ceived subsequently the B.D., M.A.,
D.D. and Ph.D. degrees.

Well Known Theologian
A member of Beta Theta Pi and
Phi Beta Kappa, Dr. Thomas was
financial agent to Washington and
Lee in 1924-25.

In addition to being a “giant”!

of a man in every way, Dr. Thomas
is recognized as one of the fore-
most American theologians today.

He holds at the present time the

 

i
|

Robert L. Dabney professorship of

| Systematic Theology at the Union| |
‘ing stable which produced First

Theological Seminary in Virginia.
Former West Virginia Governor

Homer Adams Holt, who got his
B.A. here in 1918, went on to earn
his LL.B. and LL.D. degrees soon
afterwards.

While here, he was a Phi Kappa
Psi and a Phi Beta Kappa. When
he graduated, he became instructor
in mathematics in the undergradu-
ate school for three years.

He was assistant professor of law
1923-24, and associate law profes-
sor the following year.

From 1933-37 Holt served as at-
torney general of West Virginia,
moving from there to the state’s
executive mansion when he was
elected governor in 1937.

Aside from his active political
life, Holt has been a busy business-
man.

He was General Counsel of Union
Carbide and Carbon Corp. from
1947-1953, was vice president 1949-
53, and director 1944-55.

Holt is now a practicing attorney
in Charleston, W. Va.

Steamship Mogul

Joseph Taliaferro Lykes received
his B.A. degree in 1909, and was a
Phi Delta Theta while at W&L.

Listed in Who’s Who, Lykes is
chairman of the Board, Lykes Broth-
ers Steamship Company in Tampa,
Florida—one of the largest steam-
ship companies in the world, and is
director of the Federal Reserve
Bank of Atlanta.

 

Huston St. Clair got his A.B. de-
gree from W&L in 1922 and his
M.D. from Penn State in 1926.

Listed in Who’s Who, St. Clair
was an SAE at W&L and an active
participant in student life while
here.

He is presently chairman of the
Jewel Ridge Coal Corporation and
head of Virginia Smokeless Coal
Company since 1939.

An interesting side note is that
St. Clair’s father was on the board
of trustees of the University before
him.

Master of “The Meadow”

Christopher Tompkins Chenery
graduated in 1909 with a BS. in
Engineering. He was a Phi Delt
and Phi Beta Kappa.

Chenery is chairman of the Board
of Southern Natural Gas Corpora-
tion and one of the most affluent men
in the South today.

He is possibly best known as
master and owner of “The Meadow,”
a famous and successful horse rac-

Landing and Sir Gaylord, two of
horse racing’s biggest winners.

Kennon Caithness Whittle got his
LL.B. from W&L in 1914 and his
LL.D. in 1952.

The son and father of W&L men,
Whittle was a Pi Kappa Alpha while
here.

Since 1951, he has been a justice
of the Supreme Court of Appeals of
Virginia.

James Stewart Buxton got his
B.S. in Commerce in 1936, and was
a Kappa Sigma during his stay here.

After graduation, Buxton entered
the business world in his home,
Memphis, Tenn., and is today a brok-
er of cottonseed products there.

Textile Magnet

Joseph Lamar Lanier graduated
with a B.S. in 1927.

Soon after graduation, Lanier
entered the business world and is
today a significant voice in the tex-
tile industry as President of West
Point Manufacturing Co.

John Minor Wisdow got his B.A.
in 1925 from W&L and his LL.B.
from Tulane in 1929.

Fifth Circuit Judge
He is Fifth Circuit Judge of the
U.S. Court of Appeals out of New
Orleans, La.—and it was in his court
that the Meredith-Ole Miss proceed-
ings took place.
Mrs. duPont

Mrs. Jessie Ball duPont, while
not a graduate of W&L certainly

 

stands as one of the most outstand-
of the school’s trustees.

Wife of the late industrialist, Mrs.
duPont has made a place for her-
self in her own right in the busi-
ness world. She is chairman of
the board of St. Joe Paper Co.,
and has succeeded in multiplying
the estate of her late husband.

Long a friend to education and
a generous supporter of Washington
and Lee, Mrs. duPont has done much
towards improving higher education
today.

Multi-Millionaire

John Franklin Hendon graduated
with a BS. in Commerce in 1924,
and was a Pi Kappa Phi at W&L.

Today, he is the proprietor of a
large chain of garages and service
stations—a chain so large, in fact,
that it adds up to a value of several
million dollars.

Bank of Georgia Head

Joseph Earle Birnie graduated in
1927 and was a Sigma Alpha Epsi-
lon.

He is listed in Who’s Who, and
serves as President and Director
of the Bank of Georgia, which is
the largest bank in the South.

Leading Attorney

Lewis Franklin Powell, Jr., got
his B.S. in Commerce from W&L in
1929, his LL.B. in 1931 and _ his
LL.D. in 1960.

While he was at W&L, Powell
was a member of Phi Kappa Sig-
ma, Phi Beta Kappa, Beta Gamma
Sigma and Omicron Delta Kappa.

He is a partner today in Hunton,
Williams, Gay, Powell and Gibson,
which is one of the leading law
firms in the state.

A distinguished leader of the
American Bar, Powell has served on
numerous ABA committees and has
worked for the publie school system
as a member of Richmond's school
board.

Men of Achievement

These, then, are the policy-making
men who comprise the Board of
Trustees of the University.

Many of their accomplishments
have necessarily been ommitted, for
lack of space.

But the point has been made.

They are men of great achieve-
ment, and they epitomize what is
meant by the Washington and Lee
way.

finance.)

Keesee Tally
In 3rd Period

Nips Sewanee

Washington and Lee played at its |
muddy best Saturday, tripping Se-
wanee, 8-0, and clinching a tie for

the College Athletic Conference
title.
The Generals need only to whip

Southwestern at Memphis, Tenn.,
next Saturday in their last game to
wrap up the first football title in
the new four-team conference. The
Generals are 2-0 in conference play
and 7-1 overall.

Sewanee battled the Generals
evenly for nearly three quarters and
then handed W&L a gift-wrapped
scoring opportunity.

Bad Punt the Key

Bogged down at its own 22,
Sewanee sent Wallace Pinkley into
punt formation. The kick went off .
the side of Pinkley’s foot and rolled
out of bounds at the Tiger 38.

This was all the help the Gen-
erals needed as they promptly rolled
up their only score in nine plays.

A pair of key third down plays
kept the W&L drive in motion.

With third and seven at the 35
quarterback Chuck Lane found
halfback Stu Yoffe with a 14-yard |
pass. Then with third and three at)
the 13, halfback Skip Chase burst

up the middle to the four. :
Senior tackle Bob Payne was

Yoffe picked up two yards and) Award Saturday by President Fred
then fullback Tommy  Keesee

plays later.

Halfback Henry Sackett, trapped |
behind the line of scrimmage, trap- |
ped again at the two, and confronted |
by Sewanee star M. L. Agnew at)
the one, slipped and slid his way
for the two-point conversion with |
0:37 left in the third period.

If anything can be singled out ”
the main cause of the Washington |
and Lee victory, it would have to be |
a vastly improved pass defense.

of the day Monday as it romped to}
second place in the state cross-|
country meet at Lynchburg College. |

The General harriers, displaying |
an amazing show of togetherness, |
put five men within 0:58 of each|
other as they topped William and|
Mary, Lynchburg, Old Dominion, |
VMI's_ out-|
standing X-C team finished ahead |

W&L Harriers Roll To Second In State Meet
Generals Rap Sewanee, Clinch Tie For CAC Title

   

Everybody Shines
In Win Over Tigers

By JOHN ALLGOOD

Trying to hand out plaudits for Washington and Lee’s 8-0 victory
over Sewanee Saturday is like trying to guess how much money is in
the window of the Rockbridge National Bank—almost impossible.
deserve mention.

Quarterback Chuck Lane played one of his best all-round games
this season, completing three of four passes for 62 yards, gaining 19
yards rushing, intercepting one pass, breaking up several others, and
generally playing terrific defense.

Tackles Bob Payne and Phil McCaleb both turned in praisworthy
defensive games. Payne put considerable pressure on Sewanee’s M. L.
Agnew and McCaleb threw the Tiger for a costly 10-yard loss.

Fullback Tommy Keesee, although gaining 27 yards,
game’s only touchdown and starred early on defense.

Ends John Madison and Buck Ogilvie consistently rushed past the
Sewanee line, giving Agnew fits when he tried to pass. Madison also
make a key interception of an Agnew pass.

Halfback Skip Chase was the Generals’
67 yards.

Punter Doug Davis deserves unusually high praise because he, for all
practical purposes, saved W&L from an 8-8 tie. With W&L stopped
at its 40, Davis went back to punt, but the ball was centered under his
feet. He recovered, however, and got off a low, line-drive 22-yard
kick with four Sewanee players literally on top of him.

Halfbacks Stu Yoffe and Henry Sackett, linebackers Mike Sheffey
and Steve Davenport, and guards Bill Angel and George Gossman also
rated stars for their performance.

Several of the Generals, however,

scored the

big ground gainer with

 

eo et

 

1961.
The last back to receive the honor
was fullback Doug Martin in 1960.
Against Johns Hopkins, Payne
was instrumental in stopping the
Blue ~~. lauded pening attack.

Miller said.

“When we put seven within 56
seconds against Roanoke two weeks
ago, we began building up. We
reached our peak Monday.”

Reasons for the Theme

Dance Board President Frank
Young explained that the “Civil
War” was selected as the theme
of Faney Dress for a number of

reasons.

First, Young explained, the theme
is of current historical significance
and Lexington, “the shrine of the
South,” is an ideal setting for such
a motif

Secondly, the suitable geographic
distribution students from both
sides of the Mason-Dixon line would
stimulate interest.

Finally, Young commented,

formal evening dresses without hav-
ing to rent special attire

The costumes will consist of both
military and civilian outfits of the
Civil War area. The military cos-
tumes include those of all ranks

presidents, the presidents of the 18

Also to receive special costumes

Council, and the EC, all of whom
will be attired as junior officers.

A variety of costumes will also
be available to the students at
large, including contemporary civil-
ian suits as well as uniforms of the
Southern and Nothern armies.

Young reminds students that the

 

uniforms are provided on a limited
basis and will be rented on a “first- |
come, first-serve” policy.

The printed formal invitations to

Young remarked that “the Dance
Board hopes that the theme will
help patriotic sentiment among the
respective Northern and Southern
contingents on campus.” The tradi-
tional growing of beards and mus-
taches are also encouraged.

The Dance Board is planning to

Features Three Noted Poets

Eberhart, Lowell
Nemerov To Lecture

Three of America’s most distinguished poets—Richard
Eberhart, Robert Lowell and Howard Nemerov—will partici-
pate in a series of readings and lectures at Washington and
Lee University in late November and early December.

Their appearance will be spon-*

sored by the Glasgow Endowment
Committee, which since the _ insti-
tution of the Glasgow endowment
in 1956 has brought to the Wash-
ington and Lee campus such literary
figures as Katherine Anne Porter,
vohn Ciardi, William Humphrey,
Merle Miller and Edward Albee.

Eberhart, Lowell and Nemerov
will appear in a program opening
Monday, November 26, and lasting
through Tuesday, December 4.
Though each will give his readings
and lectures in turn, the series is
planned so their arrivals in Lex-
ington will overlap and thus pro-
vide continuity for the program as
a whole, according to Dr. A. R.
Borden, professor of English and
chairman of the Glasgow Endow-
ment Committee at the university,

In addition to their formal ad-
dress, the three poets will conduct

classroom meetings and _ seminars
and take part in informal coffee
hours to which students, faculty

and interested townspeople are in-
vited. All program sessions are open
to the public without charge.

The series will open at 8:15 p.m.
Monday, November 26, at the uni-
versity’s Troubadour Theater,
Eberhart will present a_ public
reading from his poems. Tuesday
afternoon—at 4 p.m. in duPont
Auditorium—Eberhart will _ be-
present for an informal reading
from one of his shorter verse plays,
“Preamble II,” and afterward will
discuss the play itself and some
of the problems and_ possibilities
of dramatic verse. He will make a
final appearance at 8:15 p.m,
Tuesday when he lectures on
“Emerson and Wallace Stevens” at
the Troubadour Theater.

Wednesday afternoon, Eberhart
and Lowell, who is expected to
arrive that day, will be guests at
an informal coffee hour in the East
Lounge of Evans Dining Hall. The

 

time is 4 p.m.

Wednesday night, Professor Nor-
throp Frye, a noted contemporary
critic and principal of Victoria Col-
lege, The University of Toronto, will
speak on “The Function of Imagery
in Modern Poetry” in duPont Audi-
torium. Fry’s appearance is spon-
sored by the Seminars in Literature,
a separate Washington and Lee or-
ganization, but the coincidence was
noted by Dr. Borden as one adding
interest to the Glasgow plan. Frye’s
lecture is scheduled for 8:15 p.m.

Lowell will speak Thursday and
Friday nights at the Troubadour
Theater. His first appearance will
be a reading from his own work.
Friday night, he will read from
the poetry of others and comment
on it and on certain more general
aspects of literature. Both read-
ings will be held at 8:15 p.m.

Nemerov will arrive in Lexington
Monday, December 3, and will read |
from his poetry at 8:15 p.m. Monday

| in the Troubadour Theater. Tuesday

afternoon, he will be guest at a
second coffee hour in Evans Dining
Hall. His final appearance will be
a lecture at 8:15 p.m. Tuesday in
the Troubadour Theater. His lecture
is entitled “Bottom’s Dream.”

All three of the poets appearing
on the Glasgow program this fall
are widely known.

Eberhart, a native of Minnesota, a
graduate of Dartmouth and now a
member of its faculty, has been
publishing poetry since 1930. His
books include “A Bravery of Earth,”
“Reading the Spirit,’ “Selected
Poems,” “Undercliff,’ “Poems 1946-
1953,” “Great Praises’ and—most
recently— “Collected Poems 1930-
1960” and “Collected Verse Plays.”
Eberhart was Consultant in Poetry
at the Library of Congress from
1949 to 1951 and is a member of
the National Institute of Arts and
Letters.

Lowell, member of a_ family
prominent in American letters for
a century, is a native of Boston
and a graduate of Kenyon College.
His volumes include “Land of
Unlikeness,” “Lord Weary’s Cas-
tle,’ “The Mills of the Kava-
naughs,” “Life Studies” and “Im-
itations.” He has won both the
Pulitizer Prize and the National
Book Award, has held numerous
fellowships, and is a member of
the Academy of Arts and Letters.

Nemerov is the youngest of the
group. He was born in New York
City in 1920 and is a graduate of
Harvard University. As a teacher, he
has served on the faculties of Ham-
ilton College and the University of
Minnesota, and this yesar he is a
poet in residence at Hollins College.
He has written both verse and fict-
ion. His poetry includes “Image and
the Law,” “Guide to the Ruins,”
“The Salt Garden,’ “Mirrors and
Windows” and “New and Selected
Poems.” His published fiction in-
cludes “The Melodramatists,” “Fe-
derigo or the Power of Live,” “The
Homecoming Game” and “A Com-
modity of Dreams.” He also has con-
tributed critical articles to various
periodicals and received numerous
prizes and fellowships.

Exam Schedule

We are pleased to note the support and approval that has
been given to the recent proposal concerning the schedule
changes before examinations. As the Tuesday Edition pointed
out, a serious problem does exist. A bad examination schedule
could have a disastrous effects on even the best student.

As was pointed out, we are in an age that stresses academic
excellence. There is constant pressure on the student to achieve
higher and higher marks. It therefore seems only logical that
very reasonable means should be explored to achieve this
end. In addition, examinations are a strain and a burden on
both the faculty and the students. As examinations are a
necessary part of our system, we should seek to follow a course
that will lead to the best results from both sides.

The proposed program would allow a breather before the
examination period begins. It would afford the student a
chance to organize before facing two weeks of examinations.

Of course, it is difficult to offer any change that will be
fully acceptable to everyone. There are always objections that
can be raised from both sides. However, this plan was designed
to create a minimum of problems and raise a minimum of ob-
jections. One of the strongest objections would be against the
provision that would have no new work assigned in the last two
periods before examinations begin. However, this problem is
not so great as it would appear. Careful planning and scheduel-
ing could eliminate this objection.

In addition, this system could be incorporated within the
existing school calendar. No changes would be necessary. This
could avoid many problems that other such changes could
create.

In order for such a proposal to become a reality, it would
be necessary for everyone concerned to enter the discussion
with an open mind. It can be argued that the present system
has existed for many years. However, this does not necessarily
mean that it is the best system. We feel that this proposal offers
the easiest possible solution to the problem.

Although it may require a semester for such a program to
be initiated, ample time would be available for all problems
to be solved. This is an excellent proposal and bears the con-
sideration and support of everyone concerned.

 

Fancy Dress Costumes

Costumes for the 1963 Fancy Dress Ball will go on sale
shortly after Thanksgiving vacation. The costumes this year
are based on the uniforms of the Civil War period.

In choosing the ‘Civil War’ as the theme for the Ball,
the Dance Board made a wise decision. As the Civil War cen-
tennial reaches a mid-point, it is only appropriate that we at
Washington and Lee recognize in this way the role this institu-
tion played in the war years.

Another benefit will accrue to W&L men as a result of
this selection. This year they will only have to purchase their
costume. The Dance Board has said that formal evening gowns
will be the appropriate attire for dates.

We encourage the support of the student body in purchas-
ing costumes and taking part in the Ball in general. It should
be the fanciest of Fancy Dresses in many years.

 

Flatt And Scruggs
To Visit Lexington

By JIM LEDBETTER

The past week has been a stimu-
lating one in the Washington and!
Lee curtural community. Lectures
in the fields of journalism, religion,
and psychology have been offered
by distinguished visiting authorities
in these fields, affording students
a chance to supplement their courses
by listening to provacative thinkers
air their views.

There is more to culture than
stolid lectures, however; and it is
in this spirit that a forward-think-
ing local men’s club offers tonight
a seminar designed to round out, and
to counterbalance, this week of edu-
cational activity. We are referring,
of course, to the appearance of Les-
ter Flatt and Earl Scruggs’ Grand

Lester and Earl are nationally |

style, affectionately referred to as'|
“Blue Grass.” The less sophisto- |

is probably familiar with this mu-|
sic, as WREL fondly chooses a few)
selections to play at the precise|
moment that students set their clock
radios to go off each morning.

Earl Scruggs is the originator of
a unique style of five-string banjo
picking which has been named after
him, and which dominates all mod-
ern banjo technique. So profound
is his influence that a New York
Times writer was moved to state that
“Earl Scruggs bears about the same
relationship to the banjo as Paga-
nini does to the violin.” Although

Student Attacks Humor Magazine
For Lack Of Originality

To the Editor
Ring-tum Phi:

In the light of the most recent
issue of the Southern Collegian,
Washington and Lee’s so-called hu-
mor magazine, I believe several
points should be brought forward
concerning publication of college
magazines in general and humor
magazines in particular.

I believe the characteristics of a
well-written and ably published
magazine on the college level are as

 

 

 

| very well be true. If so, why must
| we put up with the crude, imma-
ture humor presented to us in the
Collegian? People of our age and
education, incomplete though it may
be, are taught to set our cultural
standards a bit higher than humor
based on cruidities and absurdities.
The Collegian seems to lack matur-
turity. Of course, with maturity we
obtain the “right” to become openly
risque, as opposed to behind-the-
barn dirty stories, etc. However,
there is a limit. It seems that the

seems as though the extent of ef-
fort put forth by the editors to
find jokes is the mere delving into
past issues of the Collegian. They
still persist in presenting those
time-worn “sick” jokes down to
the prep school level of humor.

much thought and ingenuity invol-
ved in presenting obsceneties.

Good, sophisticated humor can
find its basis in satire and wit.
Satire allows for a tasteful amount
of both absurd situations and baw-
diness. Satire has been lacking in
the Collegian for a very long time.

3) Universality—The content of a
good college magazine should not
be restricted to the campus on which
it is written and published. Jokes
are usually universal; but the Col-
legian content is usually based on
subjects known only to Washington
and Lee students. We may think a
story is humorous, but an outsider
who knows nothing of the Lyric
or the Paramount (frequent sub-
becoming trite. jects of Collegian articles) will miss

The Collegian is also quite un-
original in other aspects. “Hairy,”
as an idea and eartoon character, was
humorous, though crude, in the)
Spring, 1961 issue (his advent) and
we almost accepted him as one of
us by Fancy Dress last year. But
now “Hairy” is a bit old—and bor-
ing. He still does the same things |
and seems to be posing in the same |
position for his cartoons.

for the second choice.

The spokesman said the top site
“is located within four blocks of
downtown Lexington and is little
more than an acre of land.” If suc-
cessful in purchasing the land, the
fraternity would then proceed with
plans for construction of the head-
quarters.

“At this point we have only very
rough sketches of the building; until
we're sure about a site we won't
proceed any further with planning,”
he said.

“It will probably be a good six
to 10 months before construction
could begin—and it may be longer
than that because of the details
which must be settled.”

of this break, for it is during this
break that the Fancy Dress week-
end is held.

The history of Fancy Dress can
be traced back to the early days of
this University. Just as the Uni-
versity has grown in academic pres-
tige, so also has the Fancy Dress
weekend grown in social prestige.
The Fancy Dress Ball is indeed
considered today as one of the
major social weekends in the south.

Throughout the years, Washing-
ton and Lee’s Fancy Dress weekend

Education is now a national emer- |

 

Friday Columnist |
The war babies have arrived. |

Every September now they swarm |
to campuses all across the country
in ever-increasing
numbers, each of
them an_individ-
ual monument to
a prolific decade.
Many educators
have been alarm-
ed over the ques-
tion of where to
put all the young
seekers after
truth; the colleges
were crowded
even before this
generation reached the age of college
application.

But our educational institutions
were by no means taken by surprise.
They anticipated, planned, and then
built on a gigantic scale. Large
campuses sprawled even larger while
smaller colleges sought frantically
to avoid bursting at the seams.
This growth process still continues
without abatement.

Thus the physical space was se-
cured for most of those who sought
it. If their qualifications stood up

at one college or another. But tan-
gible facilities alone cannot guaran-
tee any sort of education.

Freshmen Well-Prepared

The jump from high school to
college, reputedly one of the great-
est changes one makes in life, has
become something less than deserv-
ing of this reputation. Indeed, the
gap between these two phases of
education has shortened to a mere
step, for the most part naturally and
easily made.

However, it is a sad commentary
on American colleges and universi-
ties that in many cases this still
important step is a step downward.
The freshmen we see now are the
best prepared group ever to enter
our colleges, for they have come
from secondary schools which have
long been the center of public at-
tention. In the heat and glare of
an understandably critical public
sportlight, these preparatory insti-
tutions have made changes. The
bitter attack upon the secondary
schools has made it necessary for
them to improve in content, quality,
and effectiveness.

gency. It is understood by all that
the United States is in a race for

supremacy with the Russians. The |
duty of every patriotic citizen is to.
acquire all the education he pos-|
sibly can and to enable his child- |
ren to do the same. Both the sec- |

ondary schools and the colleges have
responded to this challenge with
various programs.

Apparently the secondary schools
have accomplished their goal with
reasonable success— the number of
students gaining admission to col-
lege rises every year. Further, the
number of scholarships and_ stu-
dent loans to the top students has

risen astronomically. This should
be indicative of better prepara-
tion of a larger number of stu-
dents.

But have the colleges kept pace.

with the advances in other areas
of education? That is the issue in
question here.
Placement Tests
One of the steps cited as academ-
ic improvement here is the place-

ment tests for freshmen. These tests, |

given in September of the freshman

 

year, are designed to pick out the

 

 

 

,eream of the new class and chan-
nel it into courses at an advanced
level. This program seems to admit
that freshmen are progressively be-
coming more and more capable of
handling work at levels higher than
that into which they are normally
matriculated. This number of ad-
vanced freshmen consistently rises.

The reflective thinker will at once
ask, “Does this not mean that, as
the freshmen surpass the offered
content of the first-year college
course, this course becomes anti-
quated and should either be criti-
cally revised or dropped from the
curriculum?” What is happening is
that the brains are getting sharper
than the curriculum, which needs
to be modified to fit them.

Our suggestion is a careful re-
examination of the needs and de-
sires of the contemporary freshman
in view of the demands made by
|a swift-moving society integrated
into a keyed-up world.

Next week we shall present a
possible revision of the curriculum
of the freshman year which seems to
| offer a great deal of potential in
modern educational concepts.

Generals 2-0
In CAC Play

Washington and Lee’s Generals
with a crucial 8-0 win over Sewanee
tucked under its belts—journey into
Tennessee this weekend for a Satur-

western at Memphis.

The 8 p.m. (Central Standard
Time) game will be the one that
decides the football championship
of the young College Athletic Con-
ference. The championship goes to
W&L if the Generals win, but a
victory for the Lynx would tie the
CAC title three ways. Sewanee has

Coach Lyles’ soccer team was

season, losing to the University of
Virginia, 7-2, last Tuesday in Lex-

Both of W&L’s goals were scored
by Steve Hibbard, bringing his per-
sonal total to seven for the season.
Freshman Tim Henry is the pres-
ent scoring leader for the team with
8 goals.

 

The Cavaliers seemed up for this
game as they played what is be-
lieved to be their best game of
the season. Jim Moore and Bob
Szabo led Virginia’s scoring at-
tack with two goals apiece.

Independent
Magazine
Announced

‘Ariel’ Debuts in December

By SHANNON JUNG

The first issue of the 1962-
63 Ariel is to be off the press
on December 5, according to

editor John F. Refo.

In April 1962, Ariel, first W&L
student publication, was founded by
seven students as an independent
literary review written and publish-
ed without University subsidy.
The magazine originated as an all-
student crusade to publish a campus
literary paper.

Of the original seven staff editors,
only Refo as editor-in-chief, and
Bill Lowry as philosophy editor, re-
main. The other five, including Tim
Morton as drama editor, have left
school due to one circumstance or
another.

First Issue Reviewed

In the first issue the various ar-
ticles and their contributors are:

First, three critical articles on the
French “theater of the absurd:”

Philosophical Origins of the The- |

ater, written by Bill Lowry;

Dramatic Origins of the Theater,
author, Andy Adelson;

Historical Developments of the
Theater, by Frank Carlile;

Next, a journal of the First Na-
tional Poetry Festival, held at Wash-
ington October 22-24, and attended
by Refo;

A series of poems, including two
written by Chet White, Jr.;

Two book reviews:

O'Neill, reviewed by John Dunnell;

Of Long and Happy Life, by Phil
Reidforth;

And an Obituary on E. E, Cum-
mings, by Tim Morton.

The cost of the magazine which
is sold in one year subscriptions
(three issues) is $2.00. There will be
little attempt to sell Ariel in indi-
vidual issues, outside the faculty and
Hollins.

Funds Needed

Since this is solely a student ef-
fort, the eight hundred dollars need-
ed to print the three issues will have
to be raised through advertisements
and subscriptions. Refo said that the
staff has come within $125 of their
$800 goal.

“We have managed to raise $625
through ads and subscriptions up to
this point. We lack $125, but are
approaching our goal, and will need
everyone’s help, if we are to attain

Court Debaters
Reach Finals

Washington and Lee’s Moot Court
team went to the finals in regional
competition this past weekend at
Richmond before losing the last
round to the University of Virginia.

By winning a berth in the finals,
the team earned a trip to national
moot competition, which will be held
in December. The national meet is
sponsored by the Association of the
Bar of New York City.

The team representing the W&L
School of Law is made up of William
Clark, Don Partington, and Richard
Rose. Clark, a senior law student and
1960 W&L graduate, tied for best
individual argument in this week-
end’s competition. Co-holder of this
honor with Clark was Lester Cooper
of the U.Va. team.

Moot court trials are staged with
the teams arguing a_ hypothetical
case before a real judge. There is
no word as yet on the grading by
the judges of the W&L brief on
the case of the past weekend.

The team was in Richmond Fri-
day, Saturday, and Sunday for the
competition, held at the University
of Richmond Law School.

Trial Option
Unanimously
Dissapproved

The Executive Committe formally
abolished the option in regard to
honor trials in its meeting last night.
The vote was unanimous. This op-
tion is the stipulation which allows
the student to voluntarily with-
draw from the University without
coming to trial when he is faced
with an accusation of an honor of-
fense.

President Tim Ireland said that he
found student and faculty reaction
to the announcement of the EC’s
intentions in last Friday’s Ring-tum

Committee saw no reason for further
delay.

The new honor procedure, minus
the option, went into effect as of
last night at midnight.

In addition to this action, the EC|
“heartily endorsed” the suggestion |
regarding a modification of the exam |

Bridgewater Wins TKA Debate Tournament Held Here

The Virginia Tau Kappa Alpha debate tournament held here last
Friday and Saturday was won by Bridgewater College as Washington and
Lee’s two-year championship team watched from the sidelines.

Bill Noell and Al Eckes, who had won the state title two years in a
row, didn’t enter this one. W&L Forensic Director W. W. Chaffin elected
to use them in directing the tournament, declining to shoot for a third
straight title because of his position as host

Three W&L teams were entered and none had a losing record. Bill
Boardman and Jay Clark, who usually combine with Noell and Eckes
to form W&L’s first team, debated the affirmative and finished with a 3-1
record. Sam Frazier and Chuck Reese, freshmen, also earned a 3-1 from
the affirmative stand. These two teams led W&L and each received a
certificate of excellence.

In the business meeting of the organization, Bill Boardman stepped
down as president, and Russell Warren of Richmond was elected the
new president. Bill Noell was elected regional representative to the na-
tional TKA governing body.

Randolph Macon and Richmond placed second and third in the tourn
ment.

The Generals, who cruised to their

SATURDAY’S
STATISTICS

Washington and Lee’s 8-1 grid
mark of this season has tipped the
university’s all-time record in
favor of the winning side for the
first time since 1955. W&L’s in-
tercollegiate football figures since
1890 now read 246-244-30,

It took three successive seasons
of play with only one loss, to
bring the W&L record up from
the depths of the lean 50’s. Last
year’s perfect slate, however, was
enough to put Coach Lee Mc-
Laughlin’s W&L record above .500.
After this season, his sixth, Mc-
Laughlin has a comfortable 29-
20-2 mark.

The Generals’ record dipped
under the .500 point in 1955 for the
first time since the early 1900's, as
they went through the entire sea-
son without winning a game.

McLaughlin went through sea-
sons records of 0-8, 1-7, and 3-4-1,
before the 1960 season.

 

 

Linebacker Mike Sheffey launched
the second General TD drive when
he intercepted a Chafin pass at the
W&L 48 and churned to the South-
western. 45.

After a 15-yard clipping penalty
set the Generals back to their 40,
Keesee reeled 14 yards in three
carries, Skip Chase raced for seven,

Laurels for the Generals

Washington and Lee’s football team finished its season
Saturday by topping Southwestern, 22-0. The win gave the
Generals an 8-1 record, excellent by all standards, and also
brought home the first College Athletic Conference football

title.

It would be a mistake to say that, because the Generals

play ‘“‘amateur”’ ball, they do
the records clearly prove. But

not play to win. They do, as
an excellent record, or even a

CAC title, is not the team’s most signficant accomplishment.
The football team’s accomplishment lies in the fact that
our brand of play has proved successful, and that this success
reficts the ideals of the entire University. In other words, foot-
ball teams here do more than win: they make a significant and

worthwhile contribution to the

W&L “image.”

The coaches, captains, and members of this year’s team
deserve more praise than we can possibly bestow. They have
played football the way it should be played, not as a business

but as a game, and they have

played it well, to say the least.

And wherever they have played they have done more than
win games: they have won friends and admiration for Wash-

ington and Lee.

Quality Speakers

The announcement last week of the Glasgow Speakers
moves us to comment on the exceptional quality of extra-cur-
ricular lectures which have been held on the campus recently.

Certainly poets Eberhart, Lowell and Nemerov will offer
a valuable contribution to the intellectual life of the University;

and they are only the latest in

what appears to be a trend to-

wards more stimulating seminars. A number of noteworthy
men in various fields, including psychologist-theologist O. H.
Mowrer and academician Russell Kirk, have visited and
lectured here this year. Northrop Frye, considered by many to

be the foremost literary critic
appear in conjunction with the

of our times, is scheduled to
Glasgow series.

The student body has long been voicing loud demands
for “bigger and better” seminar programs. Now it is getting
them, and we trust student response will justify the time and
energy which has been spent on bringing these men to Wash-

ington and Lee.

‘The Needy Are Costly’

 

‘Survival Of The Fittest’
Set Above Social Welfare

By JOHN KIRKLEY
“How is man to be preserved best,
longest, most agreeably?” This is a
very important question to most
thinking men today. Of course, one
of our greatest problems is that of
mere survival; but, beyond that, are
other hopes of making life easier,
more productive, more enjoyable.
And it can be said that the West-
ern nations, and the United States
in particular, have been incredibly
successful in fulfilling many of the
material desires of Man.
High Living Standard
The average per capita income in

the United States is around $2,700
as compared to about $50 in Burma
or other undeveloped countries. Our
standard of living is the highest in
the world. More people live longer,
healthier, more (materially) produc-
tive lives with less effort than ever
before.

Through automation, technology,
medicine, and social welfare these
advances have been made possible.
Lives today can be essentially de-
void of pain, suffering, involvment
in creative work: emotionally ster-
ile.

BEHIND THE NEWS

 

 

Leon Bibb, the virtually unkown
Negro folk singer who became a
sensation of last year’s Fancy Dress,
has been making the rounds of
area girls schools.

A week ago he appeared at Sweet
Briar, and sang again this past
wekend at Randolph-Macon in
Lynchburg. Reports indicated that
while the crowds were large and
enthusiastic, Bibb’s receptions at
the two schools didn’t match his
appeal at W&L last year.

* * *

Washington and Lee’s gentlemen
are fairing badly on road trips.

Several fraternities—at least
three—have been “blacklisted” at
two girls’ colleges in the region, and
one of the girls’ schools called a
special meeting of its freshmen to
discuss the “special problem of dat-
ing at Washington and Lee.”

The Romance languages depart-
ment has revealed plans to estab-

 

 

 

lish a language laboratory in one
of the downstairs classrooms in
duPont Hall.

According to Dr. James S. Patty,
associate professor of Romance
languages, it will be the first lan-
guage lab for the department.

There is at present a “very small”
lab under the jurisdiction of the
Russian department and available
to the German department, Patty
said,

Rumor has it that this year’s Fancy
Dress theme of the “Old South” may
have a special twist to it.

There is a_ possibility that the

peared in last Friday’s R-t P as
the “New Fancy Dress Symbol”
will materialize right out of the
pages of Playboy.

Letters
To The
Editor...

 

 

 

Student Criticizes
EC Option Rule

Editor, Ring-tum Phi
Dear Sir:
I feel rather helpless as I write my

opinion on the E.C. proposal to
abolish the “option.” For although
I must concede to it just and

benevolent allowance of free speech
and opinion, they have made it
quite clear that this is only a formal
recognition of student rights and
will have little bearing upon the
decision of its judicial hierarchy.

Henry Ford once stated that you
could have a Ford in any color you
wished; so long as that color was
black. None the less, I feel com-
pelled to leap at the opportunity of
voicing my opinion even if my
voice be inaudible.

Keep the Option

Don’t abolish the option! The E. C.
says that the abolition of the option
is to protect the student. Why? Be-
cause it insures a fair trial to a
student who may be ignorant of, |
or may misunderstand the Honor |
System trial procedures.

When the E. C. admits that the
clarity of their procedure is ques-
tionable to the student body, it
seems ridiculous to abolish a policy
which in no way will lend to us a
clearer picture of E. C. procedure.

Wouldn’t it be wiser first, more
logical and more just, to try to
clarify in the minds of the students
exactly what to expect from an
E. C. trial? Why destroy the option
when this can in no way clarify
the misunderstanding?

The E. C. has secondly stated that
they often have to persuade a boy,
whose case is doubtful, to stand trial.
This seems to me as far as one can
go. For after the procedure and
conditions of the case have been
clarified, the boy must be aware
of his innocence or guilt under the
Honor System.

Why Force Trial?

Thus, why should a boy who is
guilty be forced to go through the
ordeal of a trial? It may not com-
ply with the judicial minds at W&L,
but the option has a certain human-
itarian aspect of decency which I
think it well to preserve.

The E. C. knows no degree of
guilt or innocence—the law is the
law. All this is well and good, but
the student still has his degree of
guilt, he lives with it, and it is an
intricate part of his character. And
the option is a way of releasing
himself from the fruitless struggle
to validate his degree of guilt and
to preserve that degree which is
innate in his character, to a system
which recognizes no degrees.

E. C. Trying Conscience?

It seems impossible that the E. C.
can actually propose to place on
trial human conscience. The trial
questions actions, not conscience.
Taking the option means that the
| individual is incapable or unwilling
| to comply with the Honor System.
| And this, I think, is the question. In
|a situation of degree of guilt, of
, conscience, innocence or guilts plays
little part.

 

The Honor System is a way of life.
It is an ideal and a principle which
should not be degraded by tyranny
or undue harshness. It would seem
to me that the E. C.’s job is not only
to judge innocence and guilt, but
it is to insure the safety and happi-
ness of the student. Thus when a
student’s basic character is unfit or
incapable of upholding the ideal of
the Honor System he should be given
the right to abandon it—and the
school which stands by it—as pro-
vided under the option.

Honor Is Subjective

Are we at W&L so base, so un-
just, so intolerant as not to respect
the conscience of others? If Wash-
ington and Lee is a society of peo-
ple attempting to live in harmony
together, it matters litle whether or
not the conconforming student es-
capes the formality of a trial “con-
viction.”

The Honor System is more than
the laws of Hammurabi; there
should be no laws, ideally, for hon-
or is a totally personal, subjective

Refutes Immorality Charge

 

 

The ‘Humor of Hairy’ Defended

By Ex-Collegian Editor Paine

By ROGER PAINE
Managing Editor

In 1595, Sir Philip Sidney wrote
a “Defence of Poetry,’ an essay
which defended English poetry and
drama against charges that these two
arts were “immoral.” The attack had
come from a man named Stephen
Gossen, and in his treatise entitled
“School of Abuse,” he had directed
a withering attack on poetry, calling
it a corrupter of English morality.

In 1962, in the Friday Edition of
The Ring-tum Phi, H. F. Day wrote
a letter which attacked The South-
ern Collegian as being immoral. He
charged that the magazine lacks
originality, sophistication, and uni-
versality. By this last item, Mr.
Day appears to have meant that The
Southern Collegian centers too much
on the local scene, and thus could
not be appreciated by anyone not a
member of this student body In that
I am a past editor of The Southern
Collegian, I feel qualified to answer
Mr. Day and his criticisms.

In defense of the most recent
edition, I would say that the so-
called “sick jokes” used in the last
issue were not well-received, and
will probably not be used again. It
should be noted that although this
past issue did not come out until
November 10, all copy was in for it
by October 10 in the original effort
to get the issue out by Openings.
In other words, there were less than
two weeks from the end of Rush
Week for the staff to compile the
entire issue.

A Look at Last Year

I would like at this point to re-
view Mr. Day’s criticisms in light
of last year’s four issues, which
were published under my editorishp.
The trend followed last year, with
a few new innovations, is that which
George Honts, new Collegian editor,
plans to follow in the next three
issues.

On Mr. Day’s charge of lack of
originality, I would say that very
few old jokes, and only two old

 

ideas, were used in the Collegian
all last year. I think that the un-
truth of Mr. Day’s statement will
be best shown in my defence against
his next two charges, namely lack of
sophistication, and lack of univer-
sality.

In the Openings Issue last year,
only one out of ten articles was
even confined in subject to the collge
campus in general. It was not con-
fined to W&L specifically. The other
articles used nine out of ten most
common forms of humor in the
world today, including slapstick, ob-
scenity, jokes, sarcasm, exaggera-
tion, understatement, word-play,
irony and satire.

In a special “Civil War Centen-
nial” section, the entire cult of
Civil-War worshippers was satirized
on a universal level. There was a
satire on an advice column to
lonely lovers, and a classical fable
with a moral punch. The jokes were
applauded at that time as_ being
original and funny.

Universality of Collegian

In the next issue, released at
Fancy Dress, the magazine included
eleven features (not counting a
large number of cartoons and jokes),
with only two articles relating at
all to college, and only one center-
ing around W&L students. There
was a parody on The Ladies Home
Journal, and some of the best writ-
ing I have seen was included in
some animal fables written by Sam
Thomas. These stories carried a
moral and employed understatement,
word-play, irony, and sophisticated
risque allusions.

This same trend was followed in
the Spring Issue, and only in last
year’s Finals Issue was the local
scene the predominant outlet for
the humor in the magazine. This
was done because we believed it
necessary to introduce Washington
and Lee to the Freshmen. The task
was fulfilled rather well.

Collegian Highly Lauded
In closing, I feel that a little honk-

 

ing of the horn of self might be
justified. The Southern Collegian last
year was one of the two or three
most respected and universally laud-
ed college humor magazines in the
nation. Its subscriptions rate high
among parents, alumni, and at girls’
schools all over the east coast. The
magazine was read and enjoyed by
the assistant dean of a prominent
eastern theological seminary. Al-
though a couple of dunning letters
came in from parents about the mag-
izine, the letters of praise outnum-
bered them 20 to 1. More than once
we received envelopes from parents
and alumni which included a dollar
with the comment, “Your first issue
alone was worth the price of sub-
scription.”
Collegian Reflects Humor

All of this is not to say that the
Collegian is a magazine of literary
merit—we have the Shenandoah to
serve that purpose. The humor mag-
azine aims at reflecting the humor
on this campus. It hopes to make
people laugh on a big dance week-
end. You will find, Mr. Day, upon
checking through back issues, that
the magazine has consistently up-
held many different forms of humor,
and that although some of it has
been rather vile, some of it has also
been sophisticated, and almost all of
it at least has been entertaining to
most members of the student body.

Policy of the Magazine

If the students wish to do away
with the Collegian, they may easily
do so. Two things can make humor
detestable—the mocking of human
misery, and the mocking of religious
conviction. Precious little of the
former, and none of the latter, was
included last year in the magazine.
I hope that this same policy will
be followed for the remainder of
this year. But I also hope that we
are not so sophisticated as to stand
on a pinnacle of moral piety and
thumb our noses at an occasional
criticism of our times, whatever the
form of humor employed.

The Goals of a College Education Involve
Intangible Ideals of Character and Spirit

By JIM DeYOUNG

What should a good college strive
to inculcate in its students?

This is a much discussed question
and one which concerns us all at
this time.

A major drawback of many col-
leges today is the increasing trend
to place more and more emphasis
upon the purely academic aspect of
education while failing to instill a
sense of values in the student. The
development of these values is in-
herently part of a sound education,

 

and a college must not assume that

enttsstieains

 

 

 

 

these values are a part of the stu-
dent before he reaches college.
Nevertheless, many schools ignore
this aspect of education, emphasizing
only the academics.

Versatility

A college should strive to develop
well-rounded students. At this uni-
versity there is active participation
in athletics and_ social activities
which greatly adds to the well-
roundedness of the student’s life
here.

Much emphasis is also placed on
a broad curriculum, for all students
have to take science as well as
courses in the humanities field, thus
assuring them of a most important
liberal education.

Conviction and enthusiasm, more-
over, are important qualities in a
person’s character. The ability to
make up one’s mind and draw con-
clusions about conflicting opinions
is an inherent part of conviction.
The common maxim “to weight and
consider” is important here in teach-
ing the student how to think mat-

 

ters out for himself. Once the stu-
dent has reached a conclusion and
has become set in his idea, he will
usually follow up his belief with
active enthusiasm.

The Honor System

Ideals that are inculeated in an
individual are an essential part of
a student's character. At W&L, the
Honor System teaches us perhaps
the most prized ideal. Good sports-
manship and the ability to give and
take praise and criticism should
also be found and developed in stu-
dents.

Communication, the ability to
write and speak clearly, is very
important in our lives. One meets a
test in some kind of expression every
day of his life and if he fails in
this test, he cannot hope to attain
real success.

Tolerance and independence taken
together are desirable qualities. One
will constantly confront many for-
eign and conflicting ideas. It is not
only necessary to respect these

“When you intercept five passe:
you have to look on the game as a

fine defensive effort,’ McLaughlin +
said.

“The mud _ slowed our offenses
considerably, but we were very

proud of our defense.”

In the Generals’ first seven games
they allowed more than 15 points
per game, but when the going got
tough, the defense got tough.

A defense led by tackles Bob
Payne, Phil McCaleb, Jim Sylvester;
guards Mickey Walker and George
Gossman; center Mike Sheffey; ends
John Madison and Buck Ogilvie;
and backs Stu Yoffe, Tommy Keesee,
and Chuck Lane, shined in both the
Sewanee and Southwestern games.

Washington and Lee held Se-
wanee’s high scoring machine to
only 156 yards total offense and
limited tough Southwestern to 124
yards total offense.

Against Southwestern, Payne,
Walker Yoffe, Keesee, and Sheffey
were the defensive standouts.

“Payne had a terric day. He cer-
tainly led the in tackles.

sought by the college student. The
respect for age, seniority, and know-

Bahai Speaker
Addresses UCA

The

to be

Bahai Faith, which purports
a universal religion, was the
subject of a series of UCA-sponsor-
ed speeches given by Dr. John Mc-
Cants yesterday

According to Dr. McCants,
Bahai Faith is one of the newer re-
ligions of the world, and now
settled in more than 250 countries
and dependencies. Its adherents
come from a wide range of national,
racial, religious, and back-
grounds.

the

class

Dr. McCants told a group in the
Student Union last night that “One
of the basic tenets of the Bahai Faith
is that it accepts the founders of all
existing major faiths as equally oc-

cupying the station of Manifesta-
tions of God, and that Bahai rec-

ognizes the religions they established
as being genuine and true expres-
sions of God’s message.

Bahai therefore seeks to reconcile
the wide diversifications of religious

belief in the world today and to

| establish a true world religion.”

Dr. McCants met with a Compa-
irative Religion class yesterday morn-
ing, and discussed Bahai in con-
ferences yesterday afternoon. He

concluded his visit to W&L with an
address in the Student Union spon-

sored by the University Christian
Association.

Dr. McCants attended Southern |
Methodist University, Florida State

University, and the Perkins School

FINE FOOD IS A SPECIALTY

Is Life Devoid Of Emotons?

But in doing so, are
lishing that which we really want?
Economically, it is very expensive
for the better-to-do to support the
less-well-to-do. In caring for the
ignorant, aged, lazy, downtrodden,
and helpless are we not preserving
misery and killing their incentive to
better

themselves?

The Problem of People

Practically speaking, the popula-
tion boom presents a greater prob-
lem than the atomic bomb. If we
support those who cannot support
themselves, they will multiply and
our children will have many more
to support than we.

And again, “should man be pre-
best, longest, and most
agreebly?” Should there not be a
question of quality? Do we want
more men rather than better men?

Or should we concentrate on de-

served,

veloping better men, even if the
lesser must be neglected?

C. P. Haskins To Speak At ODK Assembly

Four Congressional Aides
To Speak Here Monday

By JIM LEDBETTER

Four Congressional aides
Scenes in Congress” in a panel

The public session is scheduled for 7:30 p-m. in the jour-
nalism lecture room in Payne Hall. The panelists—all Wash-

ington and Lee graduates—will be Robert S. Bradford, _ad-

ministrative assistant to Rep. Rich-*———

ard Poff; Norman L. Dobyns, admin-
istrative assistant to Rep. Thomas
N. Downing; Andrew H. McCutch-
eon, executive secretary to Rep. J.
Vaughan Gary; and Robert B. Mc-
Neil, legislative assistant to Sen. A.
Willis Robertson.

The discussion will be moderated
by Prof. O. W. Riegel, head of the
university’s department of journal-
ism and communications, which is
sponsoring the session. Each of the
visiting aides will make introduc-
tory statements, followed by discus-
sion and questions from the au-
dience.

Bradford

The senior member of the group,
from the standpoint of Washington
service, is Bradford, who gradu-
ated in 1955. He has been with
veteran Republican legislator Poff
since 1957, and is a native of Blacks-
burg, Va.

McNeil

Robert B. McNeil, '47, is also from
Blacksburg originally, and has serv-
ed as legislative assistant to Robert-
son since 1960.

McCutcheon

Andrew H. McCutcheon, Jr., *48,
formerly of Charleston, W. Va., but
later of Richmond, has been execu-
tive secretary to Gary since 1960.
Previously, he served two terms as
president of the Southern Confer-
ence of Sports Writers, and pub-
lished in Best Sports Short Stories,
E. P. Dutton.

Dobyns

Norman L. Dobyns, ’54, a native
of Newport News, joined Rep.
Downing’s staff as his administra-
tive assistant in 1960, also.

All four engaged in some form of
news work after graduating from
W&L, where they all majored in
journalism. Their journalistic back-
grounds are particularly valuable
in handling the various press con-
tacts that Senators and Congressmen
must maintain. The panel discussion
will center around the insight they
have gained into the workings of
Congress during the years they have
been there.

Notice

The second flu shot will be given
to the freshmen and dorm counsel-
ors beginning Monday, December 3.
Upperclassmen and law students will
receive their second shot from De-
cember 10 to 19. All shots will be
given from 7-9 p.m. Monday through
Friday.

Plays Dec. 7

Internationally acclaimed  violin-
ist Hyman Bress will play here
Friday, December 7, under the au-
spices of the Concert Guild. The |
performance is set for 8 p.m. in}
duPont Auditorium.

 

Musician Bress was born in Cape-
town, South Africa. He began study- |
ing violin there at the age of five. |
Within four years he was playing}
with the Capetown Municipal Or-
chestra. At 15 he won a scholarship
to the Curtis Institute, where he
studied with Ivan Galamian. He
was graduated from the institute in
1951.

Wins Numerous Awards

Since then he has been touring
all over the world. In 1956 Mr.
Bress won the Concert Artists’ Guild
Award. The following year he won
the Jascha Heifetz Award at Tangle-
wood, and last year he received the
coveted Harriet Cohen Common-
wealth Medal.

After receiving wide acclaim for
his radio and television appearance
in Canada, he was invited to make
his debut in London with the Royal

Philharmonic Orchestra under Sir
Adrian Bout.
In his Lexington concert, Mr.

Bress will play Bach’s “Partita in D
Minor for Solo Violin Number Two,”
Bartok’s “Solo Sonata,’ Jean-Marie
Leclair’s “Tambourin Sonata Num-
ber Three,” Mozart’s “Adagio,” and
Saint-Saens’ “Introduction and Ron-
do Capriccioso.”
Leyburn to Accompany

Bress on several
pieces will be Dr. James G. Leyburn,
chairman of the Washington and
Lee sociology department.

Mr. Bress has received favorable
reviews wherever he has _ played.
The New York Herald-Tribune said
of his work “His tone was warm and
attractive, and the playing had a
quality of romantic passion not often
found in the playing of young art-
ists.”

A London reviewer said of a Bress
concert “ . a tone as broad as a|
river and bowing technique of un-
common authority. I do not remem-
ber any fiddle producing such sheer
bigness of tone as this .. .”

‘Playboy’

To relieve any possible ‘‘war
tensions” of the Fancy Dress
Civil War celebration, the Phi
Kaps are planning to blast off
63 FD with a Playboy
Cocktail Party.

Given in honor of senior

the

Ham Emory, President of this

year’s Fancy Dress, the cock-
tail party is breaking away from
tradition in what promises to be a
full-scale rejuvenation.

To be held at the Mayflower
Hotel, it will have all the character-
istic Playboy paraphernalia: bunny
rabbits, balloons, and free souvenirs.

“Everything possible is being
done,” commented Doug Campbell,
FD vice-president in charge of the
cocktail party, “to reproduce the
authentic Playboy Club for the oc-
casion.”

stated, “we hope to avoid the con-
gestion which has so badly plagued |
previous cocktail parties.”

In addition, Campbell is having

the smoke and heat “which in the
past parties have become almost un- |
bearable.” i

W&L Receives

Various Gifts

From Friends
Sears, Retbuck Co.

Washington and Lee University
has received $1,000 from Sears, Roe-
buck Co. through the company’s
program of aid to privately-
supported colleges and universities.

The receipt of a check from E. O.
Jr., manager of the Lex-
was an-
nounced today by Washington and
Lee President Fred C. Cole. The
grant, not yet designated, is unre-
stricted.

The gift is the first grant to
Washington and Lee from Sears,
Roebuck.

Under the new Sears program, 13

Virginia colleges and_ universities
are sharing in grants. Some 557
institutions of higher learning

throughout the country will receive
grants from Sears, Roebuck this
year.

Silhouettes

Antique silhouettes of George and
Martha Washington in gold leaf
frames have been presented to
Washington and Lee by the widow
of an alumnus.

President Fred C. Cole accepted
the gift for the university from
Mrs. William Cole Davis, whose late
husband, Dr. William Cole Davis
of Lexington, was a member of the
Class of 1904.

Mrs. Davis acquired the sil-
houettes during a recent visit to
her former home in Winnipeg,
Manitoba, Canada. A friend, Mrs.
R. R. Counsell of Winnipeg, gave
the finely detailed likenesses to
Mrs. Davis because of their rela-
tionship to her adopted state.
Mrs. Counsell had found the sil-
houettes in a Winnipeg antique
shop, whose proprietor recalled
that he had purchased them from
“an American woman,”

Mrs. Davis told Mrs. Counsell that
she intended to give the silhouettes
to Washington and Lee, and Mrs.
Counsell was pleased with this dis-
position.

The frames are 14 inches tall
and 12 inches wide. The likenesses
of Washington and his wife are
two and a half inches tall.

President Cole thanked Mrs. Davis

for the “important additions” to the

related to George Washington and
Robert E. Lee.

Tape Recorder

A stereophonic tape recorder and
a motion picture sound camera have
been given to the department of
journalism and communications at
Washington and Lee University.

An Ampex 601-2 tape recorder,
scheduled for use in the depart-
ment’s Communications Laboratory,
is the gift of Gilmore N. Nunn,
1931 Washington and Lee alumnus
from Lexington, Ky. Nunn gave the
Communications Laboratory its first
tape recorder in 1950. That recorder
is still in use.

WDBJ-TV (Channel 7) in Roa-
noke has turned an Auricon sound
camera over to the department. The
camera will be used in connection
with documentary and other film
production and for recording signi-
ficant events on the campus, accord-
ing to Prof. O. W. Riegel, head of
the department of journalism and
communications. The camera is the
first sound type for the department.

The Forty-Eighth Annual
Ceremony To Be Held Dec. 10

By STEVE GUILD

Dr. Caryl P. Haskins, President of the Carnegie Institution
of Washington, will be the guest speaker for the 48th Annual

The yearly event will be held this year on December 10
to recognize outstanding leadership abilities in students, faculty,

The Tap Ceremony will be held at 12:00 and will be

—————# followed by a luncheon for old and

new members in Evans Dining Hall.

Dr. Haskins, a native of Schenect-
ady, New York, is now President of
the Carnegie Institution of Washing-
ton. He received a Ph.B. degree from
Yale University in 1930 and a Ph.D.
from Harvard in 1935. During the
early 1930’s he was employed as
a research chemist with General
Electric’s Research Laboratory, and
in 1935 he moved to M. I. T. where
he did extensive research in the
biological sciences. In 1939, Dr. Has-
kins became president of the Na-
tional Photocolor Association, a po-
sition he held until he became asso-
ciated with the Carnegie Institution
in 1955.

The educator has been a con-
sultant and advisor to various
governmental agencies ever since
the early days of World War Il.
During the war be was a member
of several committees including
the National Defense Research
Committee. Following the war he
became chairman of the Advisory
Committee to the Secretary of De-
fense on certain special weapons.
He has been a consultant to the
Secretary of Defense and contin-
ues to be a consultant to the Sec-
retary of State.

Dr. Haskins is a member of Phi
Beta Kappa and has received the
Presidential Certificate of Merit for
outstanding service to the Govern-
ment during World War II. He has
also received the King’s Medal for
Service in the Cause of Freedom in
Great Britain. He has received hon-
orary degrees from nine colleges
among them Tufts College, Yale
University, and the Carnegie Insti-
tute of Technology.

The speaker is a trustee of a num-
ber of institutions and a member
in many more societies and associa-
tions. Dr. Haskins has served as a
trustee of the Carnegie Institution,
The Rand Corporation, Educational
Testing Service, Yale University,
and as a regent of the Smithsonian
Institution. He is also a member of
the Board of Directors for the Coun-
cil on Foreign Relations and Frank-
lin Publications. He is a fellow of
the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences, the American Association
for the Advancement of Science and
the Royal Entomological Society of
Great Britain. In addition he is a
member of some 55 different asso-
ciations and societies.

Omicron Delta Kappa was
founded 48 years ago at Washing -
ton and Lee for the purpose of
“bringing together campus lead-
ers in a more relaxed atmosphere.”
From that time the honorary fra-
ternity has grown in stature until
there are now over ninety chap-
ters or circles at universities and
colleges throughout the country.

The idea for the organization of
a society to recognize superior
citizenship and leadership came

from Professor of Political Science
Emeritus and Special Assistant to
the President Rupert N. Latture and
his roommate James C. Fisher. The
purpose of the newly-formed
group was threefold: (1) to recognize
men who have attained efficiency in
collegiate activities; (2) to bring to-

gether the most representative men
in all phases of College life; and

(3) to collect members of the facul-
ty and student body on a basis of
mutual interest and understanding

No One Goes To Lectures

This past week the student body has been privileged to have
excellent poets appear as lecturers in the current Glasgow
series. We are very fortunate to be able to have these distin-

guished men on our campus.

Their appearance, as well as the appearance of other lec-

turers, is designed to increase

the intellectual atmosphere of

the campus. More important, these lectures are held for the
benefit and pleasure of the students.

However, this idea does not seem to have been conveyed to
the student body. Unfortunately, far too few of the students
here have been taking advantage of these lectures. Their at-
tendance at these lectures has been shamefully low.

What is the cause? Who is to blame? A number of sug-
gested reasons may be set forth. Lack of stimulation by the

professors and lack of student

interest would seem to be the

most obvious answers. This does not mean that either or
both are necessarily at fault. The answer is not that simple.
There are many factors which must be considered.

To some, the answer is simple and apparent. They simply
drag out the old tag of campus apathy and hang it up as the
reason for any of our problems.

To be sure, this may well be a part of our problem. How-

ever, it could not possibly be

the single solution. The solu-

tion must lie with each individual. He must decide for himself.
He must decide to what extent he wishes to develop his mind.
We regret that the attendance has not been better and we

hope that future lectures will

attract more student interest.

However, we do not feel that the student body can justifiably
demand bigger and better lecture programs when they do not
support an excellent one such as this.

 

‘Booze-Savoir’ Proposed
For College Curriculum

By PETE ALFORD
Friday Columnist
“Eat, drink and be merry for to-
morrow you may die.”
Motto, Slater Service

We were reading the Washington
Post the other day and came across
an article of much
merit and interest
which we feel
should be pointed
- out to the students
of Washington and
Lee.

The article told
of a wine-tasting
“seminar” held at
Columbia Univer-
sity. It seems
that representa-
tives of American
and French wine producers are visit-
ing various campuses and _ holding
one-day student-sponsored  semi-
nars to teach the nation’s youth
about their vintages. The companies
supply the wine and the lecturer
and the school supplies the winos
and the classroom. At Columbia they
invited Barnard coeds to the lecture
and tasting session and apparently
had a great time.

Why Not Here?

After reading the article we took
the liberty of writing the student
who sponsored the affair at Colum-
bia and have received from him
recently the address of the wine
company to contact. If sufficient
student support for this project can

be mustered we don’t see any reason
for not going ahead with the pre-
liminary planning.

Of course, we are faced at the out-
set with the problem of choosing
the best group or organization on
campus to sponsor the blowout.
Should the honor go to the EC,
IFC, UCA, Conservative Society—
just what organization should prop-
erly handle the seminar?

Some feel it should go to the
House Manager’s Association or
SWMSFC, because they haven’t got
much else to do. Others think it
more appropriate for Sigma, the
“13” Club, the Mongolian Minks, or
some other one of our so-called
“drinking” societies to sponsor the
thing.

We suggest turning the whole
issue of sponsorship over to the
Debate Society for deliberation.
We should all abide by their de-
cision and the designated organi-
zation will then proceed with the
planning.

If this wine-tasting class ever ma-
terializes we can see a tremendous
future for university-sponsored li-
bating. Why stop at wines? Scanning
our handy Alcoholic Beverage Con-

trol Board price list, we notice over “

200 companies represented. We
could have different lecturers bring
their samples of bourbon, scotch, gin,
rye, vodka, rum, etc., and have
tasting sessions the year out. Unite,
students, let’s bring this wine lec-
turer and his wares to W&L!

Origin Of Anonymous Abstract
Creates Mystery For Junkin

The following account relates
the experiences of Professor
Marion Junkin with a mysterious
painting on the W&L campus. The
abstraction was found among a
group of paintings by Pierre
Daura exhibited in Evans Hall,

—The Editors

The Mystery of the Bumblee or
Who Painted What and When

The Professor of Art strolled
through the exhibition reviewing in
pleasant aesthetic contemplation the
paintings that had been hung in the
gallery the week before. While
hanging the paintings he had been
busy with wire and screws and
the proper placement. Now he could
enjoy the exhibition. Suddenly the
Professor did a double-take. Where
once there had been a blank space
there now hung an abstraction. Not
bad, he thought, but where did it
come from and by what unknown
genius was the work created. A
very free and dynamic abstraction he
mused, climaxed by a very dead
bumblebee impaled, feet in air, in
the center of a glob of paint. A rare
climax, he mused. Why have I not
thought of this before?

The professor contacted the press,
called his private eye, Nero Wolf,

 

and the wheels of investigation
were rolling. In an interview re-
leased by the A.P. he stated, “This
is indeed a new trend. With paint-
ings being stolen all over the world
and for a masterpiece to appear un-
solicited, may herald a new trend
in art.”

The telephone rang in the Profes-
sor’s office. Nero Wolf spoke in his
usual crpytic private investigator
tone of voice. “The answer is con-
tained in a passage from Ovid,
Metamorphoses Book XV, “The
Workship of Aesculapius, Line 155;

“Ill habits gather by unseen de-

grees,

As brooks make rivers

rivers run to the seas’.”
Wolf grunted adding a remark about
his usual fee, “And do not bother
me with such trivia again, as my
orchids need my attention.”

The Professor mused—brooks,
brooks—rivers, rivers. Ah, how
simple, it was, but anyway it was a
damn good abstraction.

Cycle Imagery Of Eliot’s Poem
Is Discussed By Guest Critic

By GARETH ADEN

The noted critic and_ scholar,
Northrop Frye, was the lecturer
Wednesday night for the Forty-

Second Washington and Lee Semi-
nar in Literature.

The lecture was held in duPont
Auditorium which was filled to ca-
pacity. The topic of the lecture
was: “The Structure of Imagery in
Modern Poetry.”

Dr. Frye graduated from Victoria
College of Canada in 1933 as a
major in Philosophy and English.
After three years in seminary, he
was ordained a priest in the United
Church of Canada but soon realized
that his vocation was _ university
teaching. He attended Merton Col-

 

lege, Oxford, and received his M.A.
there.

Returning to Victoria College
he received his full professorship
in 1947 and later became Chairman
of the English Department. Dr.
Frye is now the Principal of the
College. During these years he has
had occasion to teach at Harvard,
Columbia, Princeton, Indiana Uni-
versity, and the University of
Washington.

As a critic, Dr. Frye has become
well known for books such as Fear-
ful Symmetry, Anatomy of Criticism,
and Sound and Poetry. He is recog-
nized as an authority on both Mil-
ton and Blake.

 

He became a Fe'low of the Royal
Society of Canada in 1951 and in
1958 received the Society’s “Lorne
Pierce Medal” for distinguished con-
tribution to Canadian literature.

In introducing Dr. Frye, Profes-
sor A. R. Borden, pointed out the
great respect and “awe” that Dr.
Frye’s colleaguges of the literary
world hold for him.

In beginning his discussion of
the structure of imagery in mod-
ern poetry, the well known critic
pointed out that poets had to fol-
low a basic and set structural
pattern in their imagery. This was
because they had to associate the
set natural world to the human

 

VMI Cadets Rebel Against
Raids, Drinking Restrictions

By JIM LEDBETTER

While W&L students have been
quietly going about their day-to-day
routine during the past week, ob-
livious to goings-on outside their
pecularly isolated academic com-
munity, the neighboring campus of
the Virginia Military Institute has
been the scene of a quiet but pow-
erful rebellion against social in-
justice in its worst form.

It all started last weekend. In-
stead of going home for Thanks-
giving, VMI students engaged in
the traditional Ring Figure Week-
end, several days of fun and mer-
riment patterned after the Wash-
ington and Lee Dance Set. Drink-
ing is forbidden at these affairs,
but there is a long-standing tra-
dition that parties at which drink-
ing takes place will not be visited
by faculty members.

This tradition was violated on
Saturday night. A party began at
2 p.m. at the skating rink between
Lexington and Buena Vista. Bottles
were passed around, and the cadets

 

imbibed freely, secure in their belief
that the decades-long tradition
would not be broken. At 6 p.m., sev-
eral Tactical Officers arrived on the
scene and proceeded to arrest ten.

The cadet underground came in-
to being. The word was spread
through barracks. The leaders,
realizing that active rebellion was
out of the question, patterned
their method after Ghandi’s pas-
sive resistence and called for a
hunger strike. On Monday night,
only fifty students out of one
thousand reported for dinner,
Seeing that the mobs were grow-
ing restless, the leaders decided that
a change in tactics was desirable.
Since the next officer in charge was
to be a West Point graduate, they
adopted a method of protest used
in that institution: silence. At this
writing, not one word has been
spoken in the VMI mess hall since
Tuesday.

In order to prevent the offending
students from expulsion the Junior
and Senior classes have promised

 

to abstain from the evils of drink for

the remainder of the year. The
principle, however, remains. The
leader of the underground ex-
pressed their sentiments in these

words: “We are not complaining
against the underhanded way in
which the raid was carried out, or
even against the breaking of the
tradition which has allowed us to
drink in secret for so many years.
Ultimately, our protest is against the
drinking rule itself.”

These are noble words. We of
W&L, with a long tradition of
freedom from tryanny of this kind,
must offer sympathy and express
our desire to help; however, they
can certainly understand that our
position of non-involvement, pat-
terned after the U.S. policy toward
India in the past weeks, is one that
we must adhere to under all cir-
cumstances. A program of “Aid
Without Consequences,” coupled
with our encouragement, should be
undertaken immediately. Tell your
neighbor.

A Year Of ‘Exploration’ Is Urged
For Orientation Of Freshmen Students

By BILL KINSEY

All upperelassmen have laughed at
the confusion and utter bewilder-
ment of the green
freshmen. Newly
introduced to the
college campus,
naivete is the
source of univer-
* sal humor as he
_ stumbles along,
* looking for the
right thing to say,
the proper places
to go, the correct
thing to wear. But
laughter that
greets his beanie-topped appearance
is mostly sympathetic; it stems from
an understanding of his situation,
a memory of having gone through
the same thing in the past. Perhaps,
however, the attitude that is more
appropriate toward these new fresh-
men is one of pity; for, after all of
the color and excitement of rush
week is over, they will be thrown
into the biggest mess of their lives—
the curriculum of the freshman year.

 

Kinsey

The freshman who plunges into
Biology 1, French 1, Introduction
to Analysis, Critical Reading and
Writing, and European Civilization
wonders just what all of this has
to do with him. And he has a
right to wonder. He has been har-
nessed into an apparatus directed
by an alien will that makes no eall
upon him to exercise his individual
initiative. All that is asked is that
he obediently do the work assigned
to him. If he does this, he is told,
in the due course of four years he
will receive his diploma and go into
the world an educated man. He is in
no way given any real idea what his
relation to his courses is to be or

 

what purpose the course may be able
to serve for him. All he is given
is that this or that course “will ful-
fill your distribution requirement.”
And what does the distribution re-
quirement mean to him? Does any-
one explain? No.

The freshman feels that he is
being fed a collection of disjointed
data, and he is right. When he
finishes college and goes on to
whatever he chooses, most of these
courses will become mere relics of
what was supposed to have been
an education. All he will remem-
ber is, “Doctor————? Oh, yes,
he’s the one who taught that
junior course in literature, or was
it history.” Because he was never
related to his curriculum, his cur-
riculum will bear no relation to
him.

The Catalogue states:

The courses specified for the
freshman year have been so chos-
en that, upon their completion,
the student will be in a position
to proceed toward the degree of
Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Sci-
ence, or Bachelor of Science with
special attainments in Commerce,
or toward special work prepara-
tory to law or medicine. There
are minor differences in the work
in foreign languages and mathe-
matics in the courses leading to
various objectives, and these dif-
ferences make it advisable for the
student’s courses to be selected, so
far as possible, with his complete
program in view.

Now who will say that the aver-
age freshman registered with his
faculty adviser for the first semester
of his college year has any idea
of what his “complete program” will

 

be? We hurry to pigeonhole him,
classify him, and get him into his
niche in society and the business
world after giving him the briefest
imaginable glance at all the possi-
bilities open to him. He is urged
to specialize, to get into a field and
stay there. We have, in effect, made
him into a limited individual rather
than a specialist. We ignore the fact
that specialization, if it is to be for
the benefit of the individual, must
occur naturally and often quite
slowly. Allowances must be made
for the late bloomer. It is nothing
less than an academic sin to take
a boy who is unsure about any call-
ing and compel him to fit into one
or another mold just because he has
reached the second semester of his
sophomore year. If this is done, ac-
quiring an education becomes noth-
ing more than a dreary and unreal
game.

There can be no prescription for
gaining mature use of knowledge
of studies. In a significant sense
studies must adapt to the student
if the finished product of the col-
lege is to be of any value. Studies
become significant when they en-
able the student to learn some-
thing in particular that he wishes
to know or to find out what he
should know. The crucial question
is not that of what subjects
“ought” to be taught but that of
whether the knowledge contained
in a course will make any differ-
ence to the student. This must be
the ultimate criterion.

It has been a frequent comment
on this campus that what is needed
before any changes could be at-
tempted on the part of the faculty
and the administration is a new at-

world in a way that could be
widely understood. As a general
rule, then, Dr. Frye explained,
the mind separates the world into
the desirable ideal and the actual,
rather painful, world of reality.

Using T. S. Eliot’s “The Waste
Land” as a basis, he went on to
explain the universal image of the
seasons. He pointed out that this
seasonal image could be related to
the cycle of the day, life, the Easter
Story, and a vast number of other
image cycles. To explain the pattern
in the Easter Story, Dr. Frye di-
vided it into three parts: 1) the
descent into Hell 2) confinement in
the Lower World 3) the return to
the Upper World. This pattern can
easily be compared with the cycle
of fall, winter and spring. Dante in
his Inferno, Vergil in parts of the
Aeneid, and Eliot in “The Waste
Land” all use basically this image
structure.

Frye further pointed out that cor-
responding the image of the descent
into Hades is the image of an ascent
into Heaven. This commonly visu-
alized as either an ascent up spiral-
ing stairs into the sky or an ascent
up a mountain to the Eden paradise
at the top. Both Yeats and Eliot
use these images frequently; this
fact is extremely important in that
these two modern poets of widely
different philosophies use generally
the same image structure.

The critic went on to give sev-
eral other basic image structures,
especially those found in Blake
and Stevens, of modern poetry.
At the conclusion of the lecture
there was a short break and then
a question period followed by re-
freshments,

Yesterday evening the contempor-
ary poet Robert Lowell read selec-
tions from his poetry and this eve-
ning he will give a lecture at 8:15
in the Troubadour Theatre. Earlier
this week Richard Eberhart gave
a poetry reading and lecture also;
both of these seminars were part of
the Glasgow Lecture Series now in
progress.

This coming Monday and Tuesday
nights Howard Nemerov, poet in
residence at Hollins College, will
give a poetry reading on the first
night and a discussion of “Bottom’s
Dream” the next evening.

 

Dr. Hinton To Serve As
NFS Evaluator Next Week

Dr. William M. Hinton, head of
the department of psychology at
Washington and Lee University, will
act as an evaluator Thursday and
Friday for the National Science
Foundation (NSF).

Dr. Hinton will serve on a panel
reviewing proposals for grants to
State Academies of Science. The
panel sessions will be held in Wash-
ington. The NSF makes grants to
various State Academies of Science
for programs contributing to the
improvement of science education
in their respective areas on the
basis of the panel’s recommenda-
tions.

Earlier this year, another mem-
ber of Washington and Lee’s psy-
chology faculty, Dr. Leonard E. Jar-
rard, served as a NSF evaluator for
undergraduate science education
program proposals.

Cagers Open Season Tonight Against LVC

New Height,
S spell Trouble

An added pinch of height may
prove to be the ingredient Washing-
ton and Lee University needs for its
first winning basketball season in six
years.

An experienced group of Gener-
als, led by forward and captain
“Bip” Fauber, opens a_ 16-game
schedule Friday against Lebanon
Valley (Pa.) College. Gametime is
8 p.m. in Doremus Gymnasium.

The Generals wound up with six
wins and 11 losses last year and
have not produced a winning sea-
son since 1956-57 when they were
20-7.

With eight lettermen and four
starters returning, W&L Coach Bob

McHenry has his eye on an im-
proved season.

“We should be definitely im-
proved,” he said. “But remember
we play a tougher schedule with
the addition of Lebanon Valley,
Pennsylvania Military, Baltimore,

and Centre.”

One CAC Foe

The Generals’ game with Centre
is their only encounter with a sister
member of the new five-team Col-
lege Athletic Conference. The con-
ference basketball crown will be de-
cided Feb. 22-23 in tournament play
at Sewanee, Tenn,

Although McHenry claims
height is still Washington and
Lee’s biggest problem, he will be
able to call on a pair of tall cen-
ters—6-4 junior Howard Martin
and 6-5 freshman Bob Spessard—
to strengthen his lineup. With
their height, Martin, from Lyn-
haven, and Spessard, from Roa-
noke, should give the Generals
an offensive boost.

“It’s lots easier to hit the post man
when he’s a couple of inches taller
than our short 6-2 centers of the
past several years,’ McHenry said.

Spessard is familiar to old time
W&L basketball followers. Spes-

 

Old Talent [Boyd Williams Marks 9 Years
As Washington And Lee Coach

For Lebanon

sard’s father, Bob Spessard, Sr., is
one of Washington end Lee’s all-
time greats. The elder Spessard, a
giant in his time at 6-7, starred for
the Generals in the mid-1930’s, the
golden era of W&L basketball. He
was a three-time All-Southern Con-
ference selection.

Martin, Fauber and junior Tom
Supak of Virginia Beach are the
only definite starters for Friday’s
opening game. Supak, a guard
who paced the Generals in scor-
ing with a 15.1 average last year,
has moved to forward where he
and Fauber give W&L one of the
best front-line duos in Virginia.

Team speed is one of the Gener-

als’ biggest assets.
“We’re running better than ever
before,’ McHenry observed. “With

Tom Supak at forward, it’s like hav-
ing three guards on the floor, and

Soccer Ends Year 7-4-2;
Third In State Tourney

The Washington and Lee soccer
team has completed one of its most
successful campaigns in several sea-
sons, winding up with a 7-4-2 slate.

The Generals, led by co-captains
Clements and Pagano, began the sea-
son by dropping Pfeiffer 2-1.

After losing the next game to
Fort Lee, the Generals won three
straight. The string included vic-

tories over Randolph-Macon, VPI
and Lynchburg.

Duke handed W&L its second
defeat by a 6-0 score. Soon after,
however, the Generals began to
get back on their feet by tying a
strong American University team
4-4,

North Carolina State fell 6-0. An-
other W&L victory was added to
the books when the booters defeated
Guilford 3-0.

“Above all my hopes are that each
one participating in football
year will get more fun out of it
than they have on a squad before.
I also hope to get the maximum
pleasure from coaching the boys.

With these words newly appoint-
ed head coach Boyd Williams met
the situation nine years ago that
many called a “crisis.”

As a result of a scandal involv-
ing violations of the honor system
in late May of 1953, subsidized
athletics at Washington and Lee
came to a_ grinding halt. The
1954 season was to lack the power-
ful names of Maryland, Miami,
and the Volunteers of Tennessee,
and was to be replaced by a jayvee
schedule many only laughed at.
It was Boyd Williams who was
chosen to coach this first transi-
tional team that was to be the
starting point of W&L football
today.

His four years at college were
spent at Syracuse where his
crunching play at center was to
later earn him a place on the 1946
Richmond Rebels professional team,
as well as a coaching job at near-
by Randolph-Macon. In 1948 he
played with the Philadelphia Eagles.

With this background of big-time
football, as well as coaching exper-
ience at Virginia Military Institute
and the University of Richmond be-
tween 1949 and 1952, Boyd Williams
came to a Washington and Lee job
that offered nothing but a chance to
move up. He was faced with putting
back together a team that shied
away from or shrugged off, the
newly proposed schedule. His stu-

this |

 

dent support was limited and football
was in fact dying.

But he charged, as is his custom,
| and fielded a team that compiled

'| a not so unimpressive record of

2-1-1, reassuring the forgetful
minds of the students that there
was in fact, still a football team.
It may be fair to assume that
today there need be no reminding

Lyles Keeps Soccer
Hope High For WGL

Joseph F. Lyles, Washington and
Lee’s soecer coach, merits particu-
lar praise for the efforts of this
year’s team.

The soccer team has turned out
its best performance since his ar-
rival in 1959 when his record was
6-3-1. When that year’s senior class
left, Lyles was faced with a re-
building program.

The following season brought a

: |5-3-1 slate which demonstrated that

Lyles was able to work well with
fewer effective men.

A 4-5 season in 1961 was the low
ebb for Joe Lyles’ bootmen. The
team was plagued with inexperi-
enced freshmen and a lack of team
spirit.

However, the 1962 team took ad-
vantage of the experience gained
the previous year, and with
advent of new formations and tac-

well balanced club. With this sea-

 

  

    
   
 

 
 
  

son’s 7-4-1 record Lyles has a
four-year cumulative record of

The guard spots are up for grabs

Supak and Senior Brett Thackston.
Junior Don Wallis, who also figures
prominently in W&L’s plans, has
been sick and will not see too much
action Friday.

Thackston of Bristol, Va., paced}

14.2 average. He returns to fulltime
duty this year after playing only
one semester last year.

The shining light of the W&L
club is Fauber. The 6-2 senior from
Lynchburg was leading scorer and
top rebounder last year and is Mc-
Henry's most accurate shooter. He
is the 1962-63 team captain.

Fauber earned national recognition
with his rebounding for the second

Year Of ‘Exploration’ Urged

For Freshmen Students

(Continued from page 2)

| titude and spirit on the part of the
| students. In most part, I agree with

this. (But let us not overlook the
mutual and overlapping responsibi-
lities.) Probably the only practical
place to begin instilling a_ spirit
of intellectual quest discovery is
in the freshman. All the others are
already too much reconciled with
what they have gotten themselves
into to care one way or another. Thus
my emphasis on the program of the
freshman year. Here the work must
begin.

And so to my proposal, not an
original one by any means, but one
which deserves consideration and
serious consideration,

I suggest an experiment which
would make any later reforms more
meaningful. It is proposed to make
the freshman year an exploration.
Rather than hurl the new students
up against a variety of choices and
courses, an effort should be made
to help them discover who they
are and in what ways they might
realize themselves. There is a good
example of this type of program
at Harvard. Instituted by Professor

 

, David Riesman (ironie?), it enables

freshmen to register in a seminar
their first year. This seminar can
be evaluated as a year-long bull-ses-
sion. frequently provoked by visi-
tors from outside, which hopefully
leads to concentration on fields of
interest and specific reading and
reports. It cuts through department-
al barriers and brings together
meaningfully many aspects of the
academic community. Individual re-
search and study are encouraged
as being highly desirable facets of
the education process. The program
stimulates students to question the
college’s purposes, strengths, weak-
nesses as well as their own. Would
not this be more beneficial than
the typical freshman “orientation”
to collge life?

There it is, short and brief, and,
there I am sure, is where it will stay.
We have no time for academic ex-
periments. Only what has been tried
and proven true and reliable in the
past will be trusted. Let someone
else try it however; and if it should
work well for for ten or fifteen
years, then perhaps we will investi-
gate its possibilities.

Eckes Takes
Laurels In
Tournament

By MALCOLM MORRIS

Washington and Lee junior Al
Exckes established himself as one
of the country’s best debaters by
finishing among speakers in the
Pittsburgh Invitational Cross-Exam-
ination Tournament this weekend.

Eckes and Ed Norton were unde-
feated in the meet.

In competition with some of Amer-
ica’s top teams as well as repre-
sentatives of Canada and the West
Indies, Eckes amassed a spectacular
total of 112 points out of a possible

125. This gave him first place in
the five rounds of debate over 147
other speakers.

Forty schools were entered in the
international tournament, including
national champion Ohio State, deep
South power Alabama, midwestern
power Southern Illinois, three fore-
ign teams, and many other big names
in debate.

Only Undefeated Affiirmative

Eckes and Norton were the only
affirmative team to compile a per-
fect 5-0 record, yet they finished
second in total affirmative speaking
points. The W&L team defeated St.
Vincent, Colgate, Miami, West Vir-
ginia Wesleyan, and Alabama, giv-
ing the Alabama negative team its
only loss.

With only two men debating in-
stead of the usual four, W&L was
not eligible for the overall tourna-
ment crown, which was won by
Alabama with an 8-2 record.

W. W. Chaffin, coach of the de-
bate team, was elated over the
weekend’s results, stating that this
is the first time in three years a
W&L team has earned a perfect rec-
ord in an out-of-state tournament.
He pointed out also that Eckes has
been a member of an undefeated
side on W&L teams four times in the
last three years.

Chaffin was also quick to praise
Norton, who began debating only
last semester. “Norton,” said the
coach, “finished surprisingly well,
and must now be ranked with Eckes
and Bill Noell.”

The Pittsburgh tournament was
the first cross-examination debate
for W&L this year. The national
topic for this year, the establishment
of a free world economy community,
was debated. In cross-examination
debate each speaker is allowed to
talk eight minutes and then is cross-
examined for four minutes. Each
side is also allowed a four-minute
summary.

So far this year W&L debate teams
have had winning records in all five
tournaments entered. Both Noell
and Eckes have won_ speaking
awards, and W&L has finished con-
sistently high in all competition.

Chaffin is taking Noell and Eckes
to the Dixie Classic at Wake Foresi
next weekend. —

 

Whipping Post
Is Stall Utilized
In Dover, Del.

By STEVE SMITH
To be administered “publicly by

strokes on the bare back, well laid
on.”
A 20-year-old man of Dover

Delaware, will receive 20 lashes at
the whipping post as the nation’s
only such law is enforced “at the
convenience of the State Board of
Corrections.” His crime is petty
lareeny and violation of probation.

Franklin W. Cannon, Jr., will be
the first person since 1952 to receive
a flogging as punishment. Whipping
posts still stand in every Delaware
county, and may be used for laying
on from 5 to 60 lashes, for the crimes
of “robbery, assault, embezzlement,
poisoning with intent to murder,
arson, burglary, larceny, horse-
stealing, wife-beating,” and in short,
nearly everything but over-parking.

Cannon was charged with petty
larceny on two accasions following
his being placed on probation for
stealing a car in 1961. For the origi-
nal crime the then teenager was
given a suspended sentence of 20
lashes and three years imprisonment.

Punishment May Be Private

Public opinion in Delaware has},

been aroused by Cannon’s case, and

perhaps for that reason the flogging |,

may be administered in an enclosure
prepared for the purpose, rather
than in the open. The regular whip-
ping post in Kent County, in which
Dover is located, stands in front of
the jail, and in full view of the
street.

Although this punishment has
been considered so barbarous (and
ineffective) that all other states
which once used it have dropped it,
Delaware appears to be far from
abolishing whipping. In 1959 a law
passed the Delaware legislature
which would have made whipping
mandatory for “felons eonvicted of
robbery,” but the act was vetoed by
the governor. In 1961 a bill to make
whipping mandatory for armed rob-
bery and rape failed to pass.

Poet Nemerov Lectures
Tonight at 8:15 To End
Glasgow Series for 1962

Poet-novelist Howard Nemerov
will lecture on “the poem and _ the
joke” tonight in the Troubadour
Theater to close out the 1962 Glas-
gow Lectures.

Nemerov’s talk, which is set for
8:15 pm. is. entitled “Bottom’s
Dream.” The lecture will end a nine-
day series which featured Richard
Eberhart, Robert Lowell, and North
rup Frye.

Nemerov, poet-in-residence at
Hollins College this year, read his
own poetry last night. He is a mem-

ber of the faculty of Bennington
College and the author of several

novels in addition to his poetry.

An informal coffee was given for
Nemerov in Evans Dining Hall this
afternoon, following the tradition
of the Glasgow series.

The Glasgow Endowment Commit-
tee sponsored the appearance of
the three poets, who are among the
most distinguished in America. Frye,
of the world’s leading critics,

|ED ‘Playmate’

Will Be Chosen

By JIM DEYOUNG

An added highlight to this year’s
Fancy Dress cocktail party will be
the selection of five playmates from
the girls attending the party. The
great white playboy in the sky, the
heralded editor of Playboy Maga-
zine will serve as judge.

Each escort will submit a photo-
graph of his date, and since the can-
didates are to be selected by Play-
boy from these photographs, judg-
ment will be based on beauty, ex-
pression, and figure. Personality and
vivaciousness won’t be considered,
and of course, the pose and photo-
graphic quality will influence the
final decision.

The winners will be announced by
a telephone call direct to the band-
stand from Playboy during the play-
boy cocktail party in honor of
Fancy Dress President Ham Emory.
The winning playmates will be
lauded and awarded gifts at the
party.

Entries must be submitted to
Ralph Wiegandt, Playmate Contest,
Box 234, Lexington. Each photo-
graph must accompany an_ entry
blank( to be found on the fourth
page of this issue), and all entries
must be in by January 16th, so
Playboy will have enough time to
savor the charms of the candidates.

Contest chairman Wiegandt urges
everybody: don’t hide your bunny
under a bushel, enter her in the
playmate contest.”

An entry blank for the contest may
be found on page four.

——# Count Basie has appeared with his

Orchestra in Carnegie Hall, The

Newport Jazz Festival, the New

York Jazz Festival, and in concert

halls all over continental Europe.
Early Years

Basie’s first musical fame came
when he played with the Benny
Moten Orchestra as star pianist. On
Moten’s death in 1935, Basie formed
a group of his own from the nucleus
of Moten’s group. and he named it
“Count Basie’s Orquestra.” Since
that time he has been an orchestra
leader almost continuously, the ex-
ception being in 1950-51 when he
lead sextet in appearances in small
cafes around the nation.

Basie was “discovered” by Benny
Goodman in 1937 in Kansas City and
came under contract to Goodman’s
personal manager. He went first to
Chicago and then to New York,
where he made his first records for
Decca in 1939. That same year he
made an appearance in New York’s
famous Carnegie Hall and _ started
the trend of jazz concerts.

One of his first recordings, “One
O’clock Jump,” swept Basie into the
musical spotlight, and since he has
had numerous recording and now
has over eighteen albums on various
labels.

Basie in Hollywood

In 1942 Basie debuted in Holly-
wood in the picture, Reveille with
Beverly, in which Frank Sinatra also
debuted and launched his movie
career. Through the Forties he con-
tinued his movie-making, nation-
wide, record-breaking tours, and he
began frequent guests sports on ra-
dio, His engagements were continu-
ous through 1949.

The Fifties

After a couple of years with a
small jazz combination, Basie was
back with his big band in 1951. He
quickly moved upward and was
named “top jazz band” in 1954 by
the Down Beat Critics’ Poll and in
the following year by Down Beat
Reader's Poll.

In 1954 he made his first tour of
Europe. He holds his second Euro-
pean tour in 1956 as “the greatest
thrill ever.” He appeared from Spain
to Scandinavia and his performances
were a sellout in many cities; Co-
penhagen, Paris and Berlin perhaps
being the biggest and most exciting
spots on his tour. In Berlin he
played at the Sport Palast on the
platform from which Hitler had
made many of his most infamous
speeches, speaking a new, inter-
national language, “Basie English.”

While in England on tour in 1958
he was invited to appear and be
the first American orchestra to play
at the Royal Command Performance
Show for Queen Elizabeth at the
world-famous Pallaf Palladium
Theater in London.

begun, Basie has already been fea-

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

 

In Pursuit of Controversy

The student body of Washington and Lee in general and
the Ring-tum Phi in particular have been accused rather fre-
quently in recent weeks of being controlled by vested interests,
being opposed to controversy or change in any form, and be-
ing fantically in favor of maintaining the status quo. We of-
fer contents of this week’s edtorial page as a refutation of
such charges, especially the one of “vested interests” leveled
at the Ring-tum Phi.

We have, in order, an article in support of integration by
Bill Lowry, a proposal by John Kirkley for drastic revision of
the cut system, a humorous comment on the social quirks of
Democrats and Republicans, and a provocative analysis by
John F. Refo of the Glasgow lectures and speakers.

While we do not necessarily concur with the ideas expressed
in any or all of the articles on this page, we do hold heartily
to the concept that the college newspaper’s purpose is to act
as a media not only of campus news but also as an agent of
expression for student thought. We intend to continue in a
policy of printing articles which will stimulate criticism and
comment and which will perhaps help somewhat the cause of
intelletual awareness at Washington and Lee.

We shall not endorse change for change’s sake, but we
shall upon occasion offer our support to innovations we feel
are warranted. A case in point is the cut system controversy.
Because we do feel that student body opinion is strong enough
to merit it, the Tuesday edition is conducting an intensive
study of absence regulations both at W. and L. in the past and
at other comparable institutions at the present. In the near
future, we will print the results of our survey.

We resent the label of “reactionary,” and we wholeheart-
edly deny the charge of “vested interests."? Our concern is
with producing a college newspaper of high calibre in form
and content, and in promoting the continued improvement of
the Washington and Lee community.

‘Begin At Washington And Lee’
Integration: Are We

 

 

By BILL LOWRY

Much discussion has taken place
in recent weeks about such subjects
as the honor system, academic im-
provement and curriculum revision,
the cut system, ete—all of which
are, of course, legitimate areas of
concern and which deal with the re-
sponsibility of the University to the
student community. However, the
student community is not our only
community; and a great university
will recognize that it has a respon-
sibility to these other communities
as well. Washington and Lee exists,
therefore, not only to serve its stu-
dents, but to serve the nation in
general, and the South in particular.

The Transitional South

The South today is in a great peri-
od of change. The question we must
ask ourselves is: how is Washington
and Lee to act responsibly in this
troubled situation? Should we seize
the initiative and help to usher in
a new era, or are we to remain pas-
sive through crises, changing only
when there is no other choice? The
latter attitude is clearly not a re-
sponsible one. The South looks up
to Washington and Lee for leader-

 

ship; it is up to us to provide that
leadership. So far, we have failed to
do this—we have instead appealed to
outmoded traditions and _ values,
most of which are meaningless.

The Issue of Integration

The most important issue facing
the South today is, of course, that
of racial integration. With this in
mind, let us examine our attitude
toward the subject, keeping in mind
the question of our responsibility to
the South. This means, in the first
place, that we must openly discuss
the subject, instead of ignoring the
issue as if it did not exist. Perhaps
the most tragic implication of last
year’s infamous decision forbidding
Dr. Martin Luther King to speak
here—aside from the important
question of academic freedom—is
that it reflects an unfortunate atti-
tude to pretend that an issue does
not exist and that we can remain
free from responsibility by remain-
ing in ignorance. Such an ostrich-
like stand certainly represents an
abdication of responsibility and a
failure to provide leadership where
it is needed.

Status Quo ‘Insult and Intellectual Affront’

 

The Cut System: A New Suggestion

(Editor’s note: John Kirkley, a
W&L junior and contributor to the
Ring-tum Phi, has initiated a move
to revise the University’s present cut
system. His ideas on the topic, pre-
faced by a general comment on the
need for a change in the cut system,
follow.)

By JOHN KIRKLEY

Washington and Lee is a small,
semi-authoritarian institution in a
sea of democracy. But, since it exists
in a democratic environment, the
regulators of its policies should rec-
ognize the right of its principle body
—the students, for whom W&L real-
ly exists—to express itself where its
interests are concerned,

The purpose of an American uni-
versity is to train future citizens to
accept positions of leadership in this
powerful nation. Leadership is based
on individual responsibility and
courage. These qualities are devel-
oped when an_ individual, faced
with a choice, can follow a_ set
course of action with the willing-
ness to accept the consequences of
his action.

i feel that a more liberal cut sys-
tem would provide students a means
to develop individual responsibility
and maturity through the exercise
of greater freedom of choice than
they now have.

A petition urging the faculty to
adopt a more liberal system of ab-
sence regulations along the lines

 

suggested below would, I think, in-
dicate two things: (1) that a signifi-
cant majority of the students are de-
sirous of change and (2) that they
are willing to accept the necessary
increase in individual responsibility
that would accrue to them.

There are two points in my article
which might cause outraged howls
on the part of a few: small minds see
rain on their picnic, great ones the
swelling grain and rich harvest.

The Washington and Lee cut sys-
tem should be altered radically. As
it stands, it is an intellectual affront
to our students and an insult to their
character.

There seem to be three chief ar-
guments used to support the cut
system. The first is that Washington
and Lee students, aged seventeen or
above, are not mature enough to
weather a change.

Parental Guidance

What this says to the student is
this: “You are not yet old enough
to know what is best for you. You
don’t have enough common sense to
attend to your own business or
enough classes to receive the grades
you wish. You still need firm, par-
ental guidance to order and pattern
your life toward a constructive goal.”

I would answer that the students
which W&L wants have enough of
an idea of what they want to ap-
proach their education as they think

 

best. Often a student would receive

more benefit from a discussion, in-
dependent study, or even an extra
hour of sleep than he would from
attending classes.

Would Disaster Result?

The second defense for the system
is the assertion that disaster would
result if students were given great-
er freedom. Such statements are
based on past experiences at W&L
when a new cut system was insti-
tuted according to an_ incredibly
short-sighted plan with unfortunate
consequences. I would say that those
students who flunk out when given
greater freedom should not be at
W&L anyway.

The final statement of the pro-cut
system person is the “We want to
help you” attitude on the part of the
faculty. I say that responsibility
builds maturity, confidence, further
responsibility. I say, “Let us be our-
selves and we will become more
than you could ever make of us or
hope for us.”

One placard read, “Students of
W&L unite! We have only our intel-
lectual chains to lose!”

Disadvantages Cited

The disadvantages of the W&L
cut system are several: Often a stu-
dent needs to cut a class in order
to do a special assignment, study
for an hour quiz, or write a paper:
this he cannot do; often the time
spent in class could be better spent
elsewhere: the classroom contact

with certain teachers is debilitat-
ing to the intellect; occasionally ev-
ery thinking man needs time to as-
similate and digest ideas rather than
be subjected to more of them:
teachers can become another bar-
rage of words.

A recent case history gives the lie
to the validity of the present cut
system. A prominent and valuable
member of the student body was
“kicked out” for overcutting a class.

Hollins Has More Cuts

Vassar, Hollins, and Randolph
Mason girls have more freedom and,
by implication, more maturity and a
greater sense of responsibility than
W&L gentlemen. At Oxford, one of
the world’s greatest educational in-
stitutions, no class requirements are
found.

What should the new system be?
For all freshmen and for all upper-
classmen with an average below
1.00, one week of cuts. For all up-
pererclassmen with an average of
1.00 or better, unlimited cuts, except
before and after holidays. For all
upperclassmen with an average of
2.00 or better, unlimited cuts.

of 1963.

And what if a few flunk out? So
what? Progress is always accom-
panied by the discarding of obso-
lescence, whether it be in the form
of dinosaurs, industrial machinery,
or immature students.

Poor Student Attendance Failed To Lessen
Success Of Glasgow Seminars In Literature

By JOHN FRANCIS REFO

Previous editorial comment ap-
peared to take the position that the
University had fasted nearly $5000
and the talents of Richard Eberhart,
Northrop Frye Robert Lowell and
Howard Nemerov on the recent lit-
erary festival because of poor stu-
dent attendance. I disagree with this
negative statement, but first, what
happened at the Festival?

Eberhart’s Audience

Mr. Eberhart, unfortunately, “got
it in the neck,” managing to draw
only 66 students in three appear-
ances. And this, I admit, was em-
barrassing. However, Mr. Eberhart
produced the finest lecturer-audi-
ence debate which I have heard at
Washington and Lee. After compli-
menting Messrs. Boatwright and
Jennings for their splendid reading
of his verse study, “The Preamble
II,” he was faced with several, direct
student questions asking him to de-
fine the proper relationship between
verse drama as good theatre and as
good poetry. Mr. Eberhart defend-
ed the latter, but with difficulty.

The poet’s reading November 27
was one of his best performances. It
included many superb poems, among
them “A Meditation on Style,” and
“The Horsechestnut.” Only in his
trying lecture, “Emerson and Wal-
lace Stevens,” did Mr. Eberhart fall
below the standards which he had
set Monday night and Tuesday af-
ternoon.

Capacity Crowd for Frye
Northrop Frye, lecturing on “The

   

 

Structure of Imagery in Modern|
Poetry,” filled even the aisles of
duPont auditorium. Thursday night.
Discussing the work of T. S. Eliot, of
William Butler Yeats, and Wallace
Stevens, Dr. Frye proved that poets
have relied on similar imagic struc-
tures to relate the personal world to
the natural impersonal one. The
critic also had a sense of humor.

should discuss the issue with spe-
cific reference to our own situation.
We can best show leadership here
by setting an example. If integrating
the entire school at once should
prove to be too much, we could be-
gin by integrating, say, the school
of law. This does not mean, of
course, accepting anyone merely for
the sake of integration; there is no
need to “lower our standards.” We
should simply make clear, perhaps
in an explicit statement in the cata-
logue, that “Washington and Lee
will not refuse admission to quali-
fied students on racial or religious
grounds.” This should be done
soon as possible.

as

A Moral Question

Washington and Lee is, of course,
a private institution and is under no
legal obligation to integrate—the
question is one of moral, not legal
responsibility. Such a stand as the
one outlined above would, of course,
require much courage. Yet, such
courage would be in the best of our
traditions, including the example of
our own Robert E. Lee.

The be

than on the basis of so-called “prac-
tical consequences.” Yet, certain
consequences may certainly follow
if we continue in our obstinate fail-
ure to act. Other schools in thet
South have already integrated—the
example of Davidson, a school not
unlike Washington and Lee, should
be kept in mind.

Also, Washington and Lee was
not included in the many Ford
Foundation grants given out last
spring—could our intolerant attitude
toward racial and other questions
have had anything to do with this?
Tradition, merely for the sake of
tradition, is worthless. Furthermore,
our “tradition” of racial exclusion is
in conflict with those higher ideals
for which Washington and Lee
stands.

Certainly we have much more to
gain than to lose.

“What shall it profit it a man, if he
shall gain the whole world, and lose
his own soul?” This’ statemetnt
could well apply to Washington and
Lee. As one of the South’s fore-
most institutions of higher learning,
isn’t it W&L’s responsibility to take
the lead in this matter as it has in

 

the basis of responsibility, rather | so many other areas in the past?

with the planets. Besides what can
you do with a sun that is 93 mil-
lion miles away? Poets have always
believed that the sun rises in the
east and sets in the west over a
flat earth.” Mr. Frye, in short, lived
up to his awesome reputation.
Pulitzer Winner Lowell

I think that the students knew
that Robert Lowell had won a Pu-
litzer Prize because he, unlike Mr.
Eberhart, read to a capacity audi-
ence at the Troubadour Theatre. Mr.
Lowell’s introductions to his poems
were as entertaining as his poetry
was beautiful. The audience learned
as much about skunks, General
Hooker, Ford Madox Ford, and Vil-
lon as it did about good poetry. Mr.
Lowell was obviously pleased with
his reception.

‘

Now, more about the “attendance
problem.” First, what the Univer-
sity needs is a positive attitude to-
ward these festivals. There is no
need to be apologetic about them.
If Mr. Eberhart was rather unfor-
tunate, in that he spoke to small au-
diences, perhaps this was due to
the Festival’s slow start. Other art-
ists, namely Mr. Frye and Mr. Low-
ell, read and spoke to crowded au-
ditoriums.

Festival Ignored Public Relations

Secondly, the Festival lamely ig-
nored the importance of “good pub-
lic relations,” in the jargon of the
Journalism school. One member of
the English Department so much as
admitted that there should be stu-
dent participants in the Glasgow

Republicans Raise Eyebrows
As Democrats Raise ‘Taxes

Although to the casual glance Re-
publicans and Democrats may ap-
pear to be almost indistinguishable,
here are some hints which should re-
sult in positive identification:: :

Democrats seldom make good polo
players. They would rather listen to
Bela Bartok.

The people you see coming out of
wooden churches are Republicans.

Democrats Buy Banned Books

Democrats buy most of the books
that have been banned somewhere.
Republicans form censorship com-
mittees and read them as a group.

Republicans are likely to have
fewer but larger debts that cause
them
a lot of small bills. They don’t worry
either.

Republicans Clean Brushes

Republicans usually wear hats and |
almost always clean their paint}
brushes.

Democrats give their worn-out!
clothes to those less fortunate. Re- |
publicans wear theirs.

Republicans post all the signs say-
ing No Trespassing and These Deer
Are Private Property, and so on.
Democrats bring picnic baskets and
start their bonfires with the signs.

Republicans employ exterminat-
ors. Democrats step on the bugs.

 

Governesses and Grandmothers
Republicans have governesses for |
their children. Democrats have |
grandmothers.
Democrats name their children af- |
ter currently popular sports figures, |
politicians and entertainers. Repub-
lican children are named after their |
parents or grandparents, according |
to where the most money is. |
Large cities such as New York |
are filled with Republicans—up un- |
til 5 p.m. At this point there is phe- |
nomenon much like an automatic |
washer starting the spin cycle. Peo- |
ple begin pouring out of every exit
of the city. These are Republicans |
going home. |

| Both Try To Stop Smoking
Democrats keep trying to cut
down on smoking, but are not suc-
| cessful. Neither are Republicans.
Republicans tend to keep their
shades drawn, although there is
seldom any reason why they should.
Democrats ought to, but don’t.
Republicans fish from the stern of
a chartered boat. Democrats sit on
the dock and let the fish come to
| them,
| Republicans study the financial
| pages of the newspaper. Democrats

Most of the stuff you see alongside

Demos Wash the Car and
GOP’s Go Boating

On Saturdays, Republicans head
for the hunting lodge or the yacht
club. Democrats wash the car and
get a hair cut.

Republicans raise dahlias, Dalma-
tians, and eyebrows. Democrats raise
Airedales, kids and taxes.

Democrats eat the fish they catch.
Republicans hang them on the wall.

Christmas cards that
send are filled with reindeer and
chimneys and long messages. Re-
publicans select cards containing a
spray of holly, or a single eandle.

Democrats are continually saying,
“This Christmas we are going to be
sensible.”

Republicans consider this
highly unlikely.

As Generals Romp To 83-59 Win

Rodger Fauber and Brett Thacks-

two-man wrecking crew much to the
sorrow of Bridgewater College Mon-
day.

With Fauber tallying 23 points and
Thackston, 20, the Generals romped
to an 83-59 victory and brought their
season record 1-1.

Shank Grabs
15th Spot
In Road Race

Seven members of the Washington
and Lee cross-country team enter-

Vista road race Saturday and lived
to tell the story.

Senior co-captain Mike Shank
paced the W&L runners with a
15th place finish. Shank’s time was
37:49.2.

Following Shank were freshman
Riff O'Connor in 21st; Mack Brown-

Clyde Foshee in 40th; Rick Rogers
in 41st; and Scott Lavery in 50th.

Senior co-captain Brownlee won

Rockbridge County.

Wake Forest's John Carter paced
the field with an excellent 35:18.2

posting an embarrassing 69-57 win.

The Fauber-Thackston success re-
minded fans of the one-two punch
which kayoed W&L’s big brother to
the north—the University of Vir-
ginia—in 1960.

Fauber carried the load the first
half with 11 points. Thackston as-
sisted with six.

In the second half, the 5-9 senior
guard took the spotlight, sinking
his specialty—long jump shots—
for 14 points while Fauber added
another 12.

The Generals played without jun-
ior forward Tom Supak, who was
ill, but didn’t seem to miss his
15.0 scoring average.

Sophomore guard Louie Paterno
joined Fauber and Thackston in
the double figure scoring column
with ten points, all in the first half.

There was no comparison of the
Bridgewater game with the opening
performance. The Generals were
vastly improved, both offensively
and defensively.

Only damage the Eagles could in-
flict came on close in shots. Their
long-range attack was completly
stifled by the aggressive Washing-
and Lee defense.

Howard Martin and Fauber shar-
ed the rebounding honors for the
Generals with 12 apiece. The Gen-
erals outrebounded Bridgewater,
57-41.

Thackston really had a hot night

———“*from the field, hitting 10 of 16 shots

sank seven of 17 for 41.2 per cent.

Washington and Lee’s team per-
centage from the floor was a neat
42.2 per cent. Bridgewater managed
39.9 per cent.

Friday the Generals just were not
a mateh for the  better-coached
Lebanon Valley outfit. Hardly any-
thing they did went right.

For 12 minutes the Generals
stayed in the game, tying the score
six times. After that W&L just
could not cope with the Flying
Dutchmen.

Lebanon Valley broke into the
lead for keeps at the 12-minute
mark, 18-16, and pushed its margin
to 42-35 by halftime.

Then the bomb fell. The second
half, usually W&L’s stronger peri-
od, was strictly a one-team show—
all Lebanon Valley.

The Flying Dutchman really took
to the airways. In the second half’s
first 15 minutes, they completely de-
molished the W&L defenses and
held the Generals’ offensive output
to a mere nine points as they raced
to a 68-44 lead.

By JOHN ALLGOOD
Sports Editor

Palm reading, star gazing, and fortune telling are not by
any means popular professions in this cozy little college town,
but on the spur of the moment last week it seemed like it might
be the right time to renew acquaintance with an old magical
friend—my crystal ball.

With the basketball season just beginning and my trusty
old pal collecting dust on the shelf, a fling into the realm of
prognostication was in order.

A Friday afternoon consultation with my occult friend
brought this Delphic message:

With returnees such as Rodger Fauber, Brett Thackston,
Tom Supak, and Louie Paterno, W&L can expect a somewhat
improved season, but beware of the lurking misfortune.’”

Still a little bewildered by this prophecy, I eagerly dashed
to the gym for the opening game with Lebanon Valley.

Two hours and many groans later, I trudged back into my
tidy dorm room well aware of the wisdom of the occult.

Desolation hadn’t set in, however, the Generals had an-
other game Monday at Bridgewater. If they could win this one,
a successful season might be in sight. If not, oh well, we could
wait until next year.

Sunday night I shined my crystal ball to sparkling brillance
and sought its next forecast. Again it offered a message clothed
in mysterious language. “Road trips rarely bring success, but
this one could be an exception if the stars are right.”

The stars—Rodger Fauber and Brett Thackston—were
never better Monday night as they collected DC points in pac-
ing the Generals to an 83-59 triumph over the Eagles.

Elated by the news of Washington and Lee’s first victory,
I rushed to the reliable crystal in hopes of securing a prediction
for the season.

“There are many games yet to go, and wins are hard except
at home. A 6-10 record is a possibility.”

A 6-10 record seems slightly pessimistic. With any luck at
all the Generals ought to be able to make a much brighter 8-8.

Matmen Bounce Tar Heels, 19-8;
Upset Old Dominion, 17-11

Washington and Lee’s talented

“| wrestling team overcame an 11-0

lead Monday and toppled Old Do-
minion’s highly ranked club, 17-11,
at Norfolk.

Four straight decisions by Tom
Stover in the 147-pound class, Dick
Albert at 157, Pete Winfield at 167,
and Jud Babcock at 177 boosted the
Generals into a 12-11 advantage with
one match to go.

Block Pins

Heavyweight Sam Block clinched
the win for the Generals when he
pinned Old Dominion’s Fred Bishop
in 5:49.

Stover posted an easy 11-4 win
over Bill Waterfield, but Albert,
Winfield, and Babcock had real close
wins. Albert triumphed, 4-2; Win-
field won, 5-3, and Babcock came out
on top, 3-1.

Record 2-0

The victory upped the Generals
record, 2-0. They defeated the Uni-
versity of North Carolina, 19-8, Sat-
urday at Chapel Hill.

The next meet and home debut

 

send Coach Dick Miller’s grapplers
against Pfeiffer College Saturday at
8 p.m. in their last team competition
before the Chattanooga Invitational
Wrestling Tournament December
13-15 at Chattanooga.

Old Dominion jumped off to a
quick 6-0 lead when Jack Fry de-
cisioned Butch West, 3-0, in the 123-
pound weight class, and Tom Crowl-
ing beat tri-captain Dave Montgom-
ery for the second straight year, 9-0.

Henry Silverman, the Monarchs’
top wrestler, then put them on the
road to what appeared a sure vic-
tory when he pinned freshman Jerry
Reeves in 1:18.

But Stover, tri-captains Albert and
Babcock, Winfield, and Block ended
the Monarchs’ dreams of victory,
and avenged a 24-8 loss to the Nor-
folk school in 1961-62.

Tar Heels Fall

There was little doubt about the
victor in the North Carolina meet
from the start.

HAPPY TALK

As we all know, conversation is terribly important on a date.
When lulls in the conversation run longer than an hour or two,
one’s partner is inclined to grow logy—even sullen. But oc-
casionally one finds it difficult to keep the talk going, especially
when one is having a first date with one. What, then, does one do?

If one is wise, one follows the brilliant example of Harlow
Thurlow.

Harlow Thurlow prepares. That is his simple secret. When
Harlow is going to take out a new girl, he makes sure in advance
that the conversation will not languish. Before the date, he
goes to the library and reads all 24 volumes of the encyclopedia
and transcribes their contents on his cuffs. Thus he makes sure
that no matter what his date’s interests are, he will have ample
material to keep the conversation alive.

Take, for example, Harlow’s first date with Priscilla de
Gasser, a fine, strapping, blue-eyed broth of a girl, lavishly
constructed and rosy as the dawn.

Harlow was, as always, prepared when he called for Priscilla,
and, as always, he did not start to converse immediately. First
he took her to dinner because, as everyone knows, it is useless
to try to make conversation with an unfed coed. Her attention
span is negligible. Also, her stomach rumbles so loud it is diffi-
cult to make yourself heard.

   

AE

as
p

Wash yur Cur and be wy loo!"

So he took her to a fine steak house where he stoked her with
gobbets of Black Angus and mounds of French fries and thick-
ets of escarole and battalions of petit fours. Then, at last,
dinner was over and the waiter brought two finger bowls.

“T hope you enjoyed your dinner, my dear,” said Harlow,
dipping into his finger bowl.

“Oh, it was grandy-dandy!” said Priscilla. “Now let’s go
someplace for ribs.”

“Later, perhaps,” said Harlow. “But right now, I thought
we might have a conversation.”

“Oh, goody, goody, two-shoes!” cried Priscilla. “I been
looking everywhere for a boy who can carry on a intelligent
conversation.”

“Your search is ended, madam,” said Harlow, and pulled
back his sleeves and looked at his cuffs to pick a likely topic to
“— the conversation.

h, woe! Oh, lackaday! Those cuffs on which Harlow had
painstakingly transcribed so many facts—those cuffs on which
he had noted such diverse and fascinating information—those
cuffs, I say, were nothing now but a big, blue blur! For Harlow
—poor Harlow!—splashing around in the finger bowl, had gotten
his cuffs wet and the ink had run and not one word was legible!
And Harlow—poor Harlow!—looked upon his cuffs and broke
out in a night sweat and fell dumb.

“T must say,” saiel Priscilla after several silent hours, “that

you are a very dull fellow. I’m leaving.”

With that she flounced away and poor Harlow was too

crushed to protest. Sadly he sat and sadly lit a cigarette.

All of a sudden Priscilla came rushing back. “Was that,” she

asked, ‘‘a Marlboro you just lit?”
“Yes,” said Harlow.

_“Then you are not a dull fellow,” she cried, and sprang into
his lap. “You are bright! Anybody is bright to smoke such a
perfect joy of a cigarette as Marlboro which is just chock full
of yummy flavor, which has a Selectrate filter which comes in a
soft pack that is really soft, and a Flip-Top Box that really flips,
and which can be bought wherever cigarettes are sold in all fifty
states and Duluth . . . Harlow, tiger, wash your cuffs and
be my love.”

“Okay,” said Harlow, and did, and was. © 1062 Max Sbulmae
* * *

The makers of Marlboro cigarettes, who print this column
at hideous expense throughout the school year, are very
happy for Harlow—and for all the rest of you who have dis-
covered the pleasures of Marlboro.

Endowment program. The students’
presence would at least help to
eliminate the false impression that
these festivities are planned by the
faculty, for the faculty.

What might these students do?
Make short announcements in fra-
ternity houses before the festival,
not just listing merely the literary
calendar. If the University has a
Pulitzer Prize winner on campus,
why not say so? Freshmen dorm
Counselors might also hold ten min-
ute meetings before the Festival to
urge freshmen to participate. The
importance of personal contact,
made by students with other stu-
dents, cannot be over stressed. This
contact would at least supplement
and improve any information which
students might receive from a glance
at a crowded black and white poster.

Faculty Endorsements

What might the faculty do? First,
every professor should enthusiastic-
ally endorse the lecture series, and
not be satisfied to premptorily an-
nounce that so and so will speak at
a particular time. Secondly, as these
programs are planned in advance,
the faculty should support them by
assigning no conflicting papers and
hour quizzez. No matter how much
a student would like to attend a
reading or lecture, he will not do so
if he had a quiz or a paper the next
day. Thirdly, professors should not
let lectures die outside duPont
auditorium. I have heard only one
class discussion of a Seminar of a
Glaegow lecturer at this University
in four years. This is strange to say
the least for at least three Festival
lectures were directly concerned

Refo Calls Program Success

Despite Poor Student Support

| with class work in as many courses.
Student-Speaker Discussions

Thirdly, can the student body’s
contact with festival participants be
improved? I should think that most
students would find it extremely
difficult to discuss William Blake
with the learned Dr. Frye in a sem-
inar. However, such a discussion
could be successful if such a discus-
sion were moderated by a professor.
Several members of the faculty,
notably Mr. MacDonald, have mod-
erated such discussions, and have
done so successfully.

Fourthly, I should think that the
University would want to evaluate
the success of a concentrated pro-
gram with several speakers, as we
recently had, with that of a sus-
tained program with perhaps only
one participant. Mr. Eberhart’s com-
ments on the nature of the writer-
in-residence program at Dartmouth
College would appear to make the
sustained program, at least from the
viewpoint of a better student-writ-
er relationship more attractive. Still,
an immediate, concentrated program
is sound. It avoids the problem of
the writer-in-residence who does
not really fulfill his contract, and

it is probably better adapted to
money now available for literary
festivals.

Again, a constructive attitude is
important. I think, without any
doubt, that the Glasgow and Semin-
ar readings and lectures were suc-
cessful, both from the audience’s
viewpoint and from the poet’s view-
point. Now this University, both
faculty and students, must work to
make the next Festival even more
successful,

Forensic Union
Takes Issue

On IFC

Wednesday night the
Union held a debate on an issue
that is no doubt one of the most
controversial subjects on our cam-
pus—the I. F. C. The topic of the
debate was—“Resolved: The I. F. C.
Is in Need of a Change.” A vote was
taken before and after the debate
to determine the opinion of the au-
dience.

The first votes showed eleven peo-
ple for the resolution and twenty-
six against. After the discussion a
second count revealed twenty-nine
in favor of a change and fifteen
dissenting. The team for the affir-
mative included Andy Nea and
Whit Fitzpatrick. They debated
against John Pearson and Ed Croft.
Nea led off in a five minute speech
showing why the I. F. C. is weak
and the different areas where it has
failed in its responsibilities.

Forensic

Pearson followed arguing that
though the control of the IL F. C.
is limited in its sphere it has
shown to be more than effective
and should not be changed simply
for the sake of change alone.

Fitzpatrick completed the argu-
ment for the affirmative suggesting
a plan of revision to improve the
]. F. C. In essence the plan con-
sists of two points; one, that the
representatives not be forced to
bring back to each house every topic
under discussion but only the most
important ones. Two, that because
of the lack of experience of the var-
ious representatives, members should
be elected for a term of two years.

Croft concluded the position of the
negative by stating that if the I. F. C.
is viewed on evidence of its past
actions one must conclude that it
is adequately fulfilling its respon-
sibilities and should not be changed.

Each speaker submitted to a ques-
tion and answer period by one of
the opponents designed to clarify
hazy points in the speakers argu-
ment.

The remaining minutes were spent
in a summary by each team empha-
sizing the high points of the debate.
The results of the night’s effort
showed that a large majority of the
audience agreed that there must def-
inately be a change in the I. F. C.

ly throughout the school year and
has as the basis of its meetings de-
bates between various members of

tiens.

 

Jazz Concert Lasts

Stan Rubin, his “red hot’ clarinet, and the famed Tiger
Town Five have been signed to play for the Fancy Dress Ball.
Ed Croft, Vice-President of the Dance Board, announced this
week that Rubin and his band would probably play early in the
evening as people come in and then take over near midnight
with a free-wheeling Dixieland ‘‘jam session.”

Croft said that he and the Dance Board were ‘“‘astounded”

| at the record sale of 458 Civil War costumes in only three days.

Croft explained that the third day of costume sales was called
off because the rental firm had run out of costumes; however,
he said there would be another sale held just after the Christ-
mas Holidays.

The Whole Dance Board is reportedly anticipating ‘‘the
best Fancy Dress in years.”

Slated alongside Count Basie, whose signing was an-
nounced earlier this week, Rubin and his Tiger Town Five will
balance out the evening perfectly. Stan and most of his group
began playing together at Princeton, from which the name
Tiger Town Five was taken. He graduated from Princeton in
1955.

That same year they played their first concert in Carnegie
Hall and their Dixieland music was such a smash that since
then, they have returned three times.

Even while at Princeton, Stan took his band on a “once
in a lifetime” trip to Europe. There they toasted royalty and
played for some of Elsa Maxwell’s famous parties on the
French Riviera. They returned to the states where they blasted

From Midnight On

at the wild Newport Jazz Festival, featured among the
greatest in the jazz world.

In 1956 Stan and the ‘‘Five’’ received international acclaim
when they, as a part of his larger orchestra, were invited to be
the only American group playing at the festivities in Monaco
for the Grace Kelly, Prince Rainier wedding.

Since then Stan has been touring the world. He plays at
numerous cotillions, such as the Cinderella Ball in Pittsburgh;
he has entertained at yacht parties for such socialites as Aris-
totle Onassis and Mike Todd; he appears at night clubs, both
in America and on the continent; and he plays for hundreds of
college proms.

Recognized as one of our country’s leading Dixieland
bands, Rubin’s Tiger Town Five could prove to be as sen-
sational as anything that has hit this school in years. And what
is more, the “jam session” after the Fancy Dress Ball has no
time limit.

Count Basie and his 17-piece orchestra will provide the
music for the actual ball. Like Rubin, Basie has appeared at
Carnegie Hall and toured Europe. Both groups were featured
at Newport in 1955 and have been considered among the
country’s top jazz groups for several years.

One thing surprising about Rubin is that he has acquired
than most men twice his age.”” Much of his success lies in the
versatility of his group. Stan can use the Tiger Town Five as a
solo group or, when the occasion warrants, merge it with his
larger orchestra. This “double punch” has created a great de-
mand for Rubin’s music in night clubs around the country.

Many people have become Stan Rubin fans through hear-
ing one or more of his albums. “Ivy League: Jazz Band Ball”’
is probably his most popular release. “Dixieland Bash” and the
recording from his Monaco appearance are also high in the
ratings.

As a prelude to the weekend’s festivities, the Phi Kaps are
throwing a Playboy cocktail party honoring FD President Ham
Emory. To be cast in the atmosphere of the famous Playboy
Club, the party will be highlighted by the sounds of the Del
Vikings.

A contest is now underway to determine the playmates for

tthe occasion: Students are urged to enter their dates in the

competition for this much-prized honor.

Resurrection Of Fancy Dress

This year’s sale of Fancy Dress Costumes has broken all
existing records. In the first two days, 458 costumes were sub-
scribed to by students. This indicates overwhelming interest

and support of this year’s ball.

It is gratifying to note that the student body has shown
this great interest. With the fine entertainment contracted and
the large student support, Fancy Dress can now return to its
former position of prominence. Fancy Dress now has the op-
portunity to regain its position as “the number one collegiate

social event in the South.”

The Dance Board is to be congratulated for its work in
organizing and promoting this year’s ball. Through their ef-
forts, success has been assured. Fancy Dress President Ham
Emory has gone all out to provide the best possible activities for
the weekend. With the continued support and enthusiasm of
the student body, this year’s Fancy Dress can long be remem-
bered as one of the best in its long history.

 

Student And Faculty Consensus
Favors Revision Of Cut System

By KEN LANE
Assistant Managing Editor

In last Tuesday’s Ring-tum Phi,
John Kirkley presented a proposal
that we liberalize our cut system.
In essence, the change would per-
mit unlimited cuts, except before
and after holidays, to all upperclass-
men having an average of 1.0 or
better. Those with 2.0 or better
would continue to enjoy their pres-
ent privileges. All freshmen and up-
perclassmen with an average be-
low 1.0 would receive one week of
cuts.

Surprisingly enough, many faculty
members have expressed their ap-
proval of such a revision. The ma-
jority of those we interviewed felt
that our student body is now of
such a caliber that it can live up to,

 

Student Racks “Zero For Five”

Well, the other night I went zero-

average in any-
one’s league. Un-
der the circum-
stances it pained
me particularly.

it was the first
time it had ever
happened. I’m not
griping about that.
I've had plenty of
bad nights over
there before, but
never quite like
this one. It’s not the sort of thing
your forget right away....

Where was I: What was I doing?
No, I wasn’t at Sweet Briar, or

I wasn’t even sitting in my cozy

Student Writes On W&XL Integration

By HARRY FOLTZ

Mr. Lowry in last Tuesday’s Ring-
tum Phi suggested that Washington
and Lee integrate and in doing so
said that the issue should “be de-
cided on the basis of responsibility,
rather than on the basis of so-called
practical consequences.” Having
spent five years at W&L as an un-
dergraduate and a law student and
since I am also a Southerner from
the state that produced the Little
Rock crisis, perhaps I can point out
a few practical consequences of
W&L integrating, and also add an
opinion of my own on the subject.

W&L

The Negro admitted to W&L
would find, as does James Meredith
at Mississippi, that he would be
shunned by the students socially.
He would not be welcome at the
fraternity parties, would certainly
not be asked to join a fraternity,
and the prospect of asking him to
go down the road would be almost
unthinkable. In short, he would find
that his participation in the life of
W&L would be sharply limited to
the academic side, with almost com-
plete exclusion from the social side.

Any Negro who came to W&L
expecting more would be almost
incredibly naive. We are all crea-
tures of our environment to a
certain extent, and that environ-
ment has taught all of us South-
erners and probably a majority of
the Notherners that Negroes are

not acceptable socially. Although
I realize that this attitude is in
theory at least, unjustifiable, I
nevertheless accept it in practice.
I would find it almost impossible
to accept a Negro as my close
friend, and certainly would never
dream of dating one. Environment
from the time we were born has
made the great majority of us
feel this way, even if some of us
realize that there is lack of reason
in such an attitude.

Notwithstanding this prevailing at-
titude and the consequences that
it means for the Negroes involved,
however, should W&L still inte-
grate? I say definitely, yes.

Environment

The reason I say this is because
I see no reason to deny one an edu-
cation, just because we will deny
him social privileges while he gets
that education. Environment may
make us deny the Negro social
provileges, but it certainly does not
make us deny him an education.

I think all of us can learn to
sit beside a Negro in class, in the
commons, and live in the same
dormitory with him, Even though
I do not prefer to do these things,
I certainly think I could bring my-
self to do them when I consider
that by making such a small sac-
rifice of unreasonable prejudice
that I am allowing one to get a
first rate education, that I am fol-
lowing the spirit of Atlanta rather
than of Mississippi, and that I am
helping Washington and Lee dem-
onstrate that it is an_ institution
that recognizes that education
should not be denied on the basis
of race.

Spirit of Atlanta

The spirit of Atlanta which has
received acclaim and respect all over
the country is not one which in-
vites the Negro to that city’s social
functions, but is simply one that
invites him to use the best educa-
tional facilities available in order
that he may lift himself up so that
someday he truly will be equal and
race prejudice will be completely
without foundation. Surely to adopt
that spirit is not too much to ask of
the students, the faculty, and the
trustees of one of the South’s great-
est universities.

 

ated five of the nine short stories I
had hoped to read. I assumed that
was about par for the course, but the
worst was yet to come.

We do have a file on Collier's. Un-
fortunately, it is a bit incomplete...
so incomplete, in fact, that I couldn’t
find even one of the remaining four
stories that I had hoped to stumble
across. Disappointed but not yet de-
feated I forgot what Salinger had
written, and I trundled off in pursuit
of an article about Salinger in Life.
This was the fifth time I had sought
out this particular article. It fic-
titiously resides in a bound volume
of Life that is not supposed to ever
leave the browsing room. Five dif-
ferent times I have looked for this
volume at all hours of the morning,
afternoon, and night. I don’t think
it exists. Never have I found that
volume in the browsing room or
elsewhere in our library.

Broken now but still unbowed

I went downstairs to search out
specific issues of both Newsweek
and Time. Thirty minutes and
some two hundred and seventy-
odd copies of Time and Newsweek
later, I stood in our dusty stacks
perplexed and utterly befuddled.
My hands were black with print-
er’s ink, my back ached, my brain
was numb, and I knew I was
licked. Quietly I gathered my
books and stumped off into the
black, surrounding night.

Oh, I could continue my search,
but with an average like that I had
better quit before I discover some-
thing that will prove my suspicion
that J. D. Salinger, all his works,
and everything written about him,
are the products of a ghost writer
who haunts the Cyrus McCormick
Library’s stacks.

    

and profit by, the added responsi-
bility. There would, of course, be
that small minority of students who
would take undue advantage of
such freedom, but, as one professor
rather philosophically remarked,
“you can’t deny the validity of a
system merely because some will
abuse it.”

Psychological Advantages

Some teachers are considering the
psychological advantages which a
more liberal system offers. The fact
that the student may choose whether
or not to attend a lecture would
erase any negative attitudes which
might result from being a “captive”
audience. More interest and spon-
taneity might be aroused if the
student attends classes on his own
volition.

There was a definite feeling that
the cut system should be revised
for freshmen. The one cut per class
during the first semester is felt
by most teachers to be too re-
strictive.

Some teachers felt that Kirkley’s
plan was too liberal and there was
need for a compromise. There was
the suggestion that a 1.4 average
should be maintained for unlimited
cuts instead of the proposed 1.0. This
would motivate students to strive
beyond the “gentleman’s C” aver-
age. Another suggestion was the pos-
sibility of letting the individual pro-
fessor decide whether to permit un-
limited cuts in his classes.

liberalized cut system maintain that
W&L students on the whole are not
mature or responsible enough to
handle so great a freedom. Having
unlimited cuts would just create
more leisure time for the students
and would have the result of relax-
ing our academic atmosphere.

The opponents of the revision plan
support their argument by referring
to a similar plan instituted several
years ago. The plan provided a
gradual granting of unlimited cuts,
starting with the senior class. The
new privileges were almost fatal to
the seniors. Grades were so low by
the end of the semester that the
plan had to be abandoned. As an-
other example, one profsessor ob-
served that at Harvard, one of the
schools having unlimited cuts, 25
per cent of the students fail out
without attaining their degrees.
“Can we really fool ourselves,” asked
one professor, “into thinking that
the average student is going to study
harder and do more independent
work if given unlimited cuts?”

Another teacher argued that the
requirement of a 2.0 for unlimited
cuts only serves as an incentive to
the student to live up to what he
can do. “Considering the high aca-
demic average and College Board
scores needed for entrance here,”
remarked one professor, “there is
not a student at Washington and Lee
who can’t get a 2.0 if he works for

Student Opinion

Student opinion appears to be al-
most unanimously in favor of the
proposed revision.. In general, they

attend the Euphorians’ schools,
which were called “Pursuit of Hap-
piness” schools, after an ancient
theory. There they were taught

principally to get along happily with
other Euphorians. A certain amount
of learning was required of them, so
they could advance to the level of
the popular college, where the smiles
were brighter, the cars faster and
the happiness possibilities almost
without limit.

When they grew older, the Eu-
phorians gave up learning for earn-
ing. Earning was a sure path to hap-
piness. The fast return had once
performed its alchemies with magic
swiftness. Better now was the slow,
sure return, with fringe benefits.
The comfort and security thus
gained made all things possible for

Chapel Restoration On Schedule;
Re-Opening Expected In June

Work on the restoration of his-
toric Lee Chapel on the Washington
and Lee University campus appears
to be on schedule.

The $370,000 project, begun early
in June, is being done by work
crews from the John J. Pettyjohn
Company of Lynchburg. All funds
for the undertaking were made
available to Washington and Lee last
year by the Ford Motor Company
Fund of Dearborn, Mich., to “help
preserve one of the South’s most
prized landmarks.”

Plans call for the restored Chapel
to be re-opened in appropriate cere-
monies in June before the close of
Washington and Lee’s 1962-63 aca-
demic year.

Underground Room

A special underground room for |

air conditioning and heating equip-
ment has been completed, according
to D. E. Brady, Jr., the university’s
superintendent of buildings
grounds. Some of the

units—has been installed.

Steel Beams

The installation of steel beams in
the nearly 100-year-old structure’s
roof was finished several weeks ago.
The beams replace solid wooden
ones that have supported the brick
Chapel’s roof since it was built in
1867. The slate that was removed
from the original roof will be put
back in place.

Steel floor beams also have been

and |
permanent |
equipment—compressors and heating

put in place and a concrete sub-
flooring has been poured. The
wooden flooring in the Chapel was
removed for refinishing and will
be put back down as the restora-
tion work progresses. The Chapel’s
original wooden pews are being
refinished and will be kept in stor-
age until Spring.

Construction officials report that
the brick walls of the Chapel are
sound and no “major work” will be
necessary.

Although emphasis in the Chap-
el project is on restoration, plans
call for extensive improvements
which will assure the future pres-
ervation of the building and its
valuable contents. Complete air

 

conditioning will aid in preserving |

the million-dollar art collection
that hangs in the Chapel and hun-
dreds of items of Lee memorabilia
displayed in the Chapel’s basement
museum, The paintings and mu-
seum pieces are in storage on the
Washington and Lee campus until
the restoration project is com-
pleted.
Experts

Restoration experts have recom-
mended certain changes in the dis-
| play of art work, museum items and
the recumbent statue of General
| Robert E. Lee. The changes are de-
| signed to enhance the Chapel’s ap-
| peal to the 30,000 persons who visit
it annually. Workmen currently are
| concentrating their work in the
; basement museum area. The famous

 

Valentine recumbent statue of Lee,
although not removed from the
Chapel, is enclosed by a protective
wooden box.

Boston architectural firm that
specializes in restoration work, are
consulting architects for the pro-
ject. The Boston architects planned
and supervised the restoration of
Colonial Williamsburg. Clark, Nex-
sen and Owen, Washington and Lee
architects, drew up the specifications
for the restoration.

The Chapel's restoration marks
the second majer construction
job the Pettyjohn firm is handling
on the university’s campus. Other
Pettyjohn work crews are putting
the finishing touches on Washing-
ton and Lee’s $1,525,000 science fa-

| cilities for biology, chemistry, ge-

ology and physies.

Lee Chapel was built in 1867 un-
der the supervision of General
Robert E. Lee, who served as pres-
ident of Washington College (now
Washington and Lee) from 1865 un-
til his death in 1870. The building
was extended in 1883 to provide
space for Edward Valentine’s re-
cumbent statute and the Lee family
crypt where the Southern general’s
body rests. When the restoration is
completed, the Chapel will be as it
was in 1883 rather than 1867.

The Chapel was declared a Na-
tional Historic Landmark by the
U.S. Department of the Interior in
1961.

feel that the student of today, un-
like his counterpart a decade ago,
is prepared to take on his freedom.
Because of higher academic stand-
ards and tougher entrance require-
ments, the nature of the student
body is such that it is more mature
and responsible.

Several students observe that if
we were given unlimited cuts, some
teachers would have to improve the
quality of their classes. They will
have to have more to offer in their
lectures in order to keep up attend-
ance. Under the present system, stu-
dents argue, these less desirable
teachers are under no pressure to
improve.

Some Disagreement

Not all students favor change.
Some feel that unlimited cuts would
be disastrous to a good number of
the student body. They would be
tempted to take trips to remote girls’
colleges or extend their weekends a
day or two.

Others feel there should be a
compromise. Several felt that two
weeks of cuts would be more than
enough, rather than the proposed
unlimiteds.

Nevertheless, the general consen-
sus favors some type of change.
Kirkley has had an unusually good
response from the student body and
a great deal of encouragement from
the faculty. Several alternatives and
modifications are also being consid-
ered. Such evidence helps to point
out rather pointedly, that W&L,
the “bastion of tradition,’ might be
undergoing a new transition.

Euphorian Education
Offers Many Problems

Euphorians but, eliminating the ne-
cessity of doing most things, made
only a few things desirable. Yet the
rewards of earning were varied
enough to keep Euphorians from ap-
palling fates like singlemindedness
or contemplation or eccentricity.

Most appalling of all were two
major failings which the modern
Euphorians atavistically called here-
sies—discontent and curiosity. In
this country of smiles, where so-
phistication was the ability to sit
unflinchingly through a play with-
out a happy ending, the true Eu-
phorian did his best to conceal any
breach of contentment as quickly as
it appeared. This ability grew to be
prodigious. The Euphorians were
able to apply it, with some success,
to facts as well as opinions.

The task of killing curiosity was
more difficult, since curiosity had
long been regarded as a_ virtual
Euphorian patent. But modern Eu-
phorians, with so much done for
them, preferred to let curiosity grad-
ually doze off. They still said in
their speeches that every Euphorian
boy liked nothing better than to
take a car apart or explore the
sources of a forest river. But the
cars grew too complicated for the
amateur repairman and everyone
knew that all the forest rivers were
already carefully mapped.

Critics occasionally questioned
whether the happy Euphorians were
not destroying their own traditional
austerity of mind, valuable in re-
pairing furnaces, inventing nuclear
processes, and separating the com-
ponents of hazy diplomatic situa-
tions. The modern Euphorians re-
plied that mental austerity was as
uncomfortable, unnecessary and out-
moded as a kitchen without push-
buttons, or a speech without slogans.
Then they would repeat the new
national anthem which the children
were taught in the happiness schools:

We are the biggest; we are the

best;

We are ahead of all the rest.

It was at this point in their history,
that Euphoria found out that it was
not ahead.

The latest “ultimate” weapon of
destruction had been devised and
perfected by the Seythians, a larger
but traditionally dumber people
whose national symbol, the scowl,
had been warring with the Euphor-
ian smile. It was impossible to claim
that the Scythians had stolen the
weapon from them—a source of cur-
ious reassurance in similar cases.
for the Euphorians had possessed
none themselves. Nor could they
pass the discovery off as happen-

Pfeiffer Team
Dangerous Foe

Coach Dick Miller’s matmen meet
a small but determined Pfeiffer
College team in Doremus gym to-
morrow night at 8 pm. W&L will
be trying to maintain its undefeat-
ed status acquired by upsetting Old
Dominion 17-11 anc thoroughly
trouncing UNC 19-8. This will be
the team’s last competition as a unit
before the Chattanooga Invitational
Tournament.

Although not as strong as the Tar
Heels and Old Dominion, Pfeiffer
should not be regarded as easy. Last
year Pfeiffer gave Coach Miller’s
team a slight scare by leading the
match 9-8 at the end of the 157-
pound class. With returning stars
such as Boyd Stokes and Butch Al-
bie, Pfeiffer may be tougher than
expected. Coach Miller intends to
regard them as the toughest and go
all out against them.

Proposals

Modified Plan Approved

At the regular monthly meeting
of the faculty yesterday a resolu-

tion regarding hour quizzes during}.

the last week of classes before final
exams was passed.

The Statement to the Tuesday
Edition of The Ring-tum Phi reads
as follows: “The faculty of Washing-
ton and Lee recognizes the difficul-
ties confronting students whose ex-
aminations fall heavily in the early
part of the examination period; it
urges as one means of alleviating
these difficulties, that individual
members of the faculty try to avoid
scheduling hour quizzes during the
final week of classes in this semester;
and, as an expression of its sympa-
thy with the spirit of the proposals
made by the editors of The Ring-
tum Phi, it requests the Committee
on Courses and Degrees to consider
further and more permanent means
of meeting the difficulties which
prompted these proposals.”

Action Is Result of Editorial

This recommendation is the result
of an editorial in this edition which
pointed out the hardship felt by
many students whose exam sched-
ules were disadvantageously ar-
ranged. The first proposal set forth
in the editorial was that hour quiz-
zes during the week before ebams
be eliminated. It is important to note
that the faculty felt that this pro-
posal was justified enough to “urge”
professors not to have quizzes during
that week. At this late date, its im-
possible to alter the quizzes already
set by some professors for the last
week, however, and so the recom-
mendation cannot necessarily be
complied with by all the members
of the faculty.

It is important also to note that
the matter has been referred to the
Committee on Courses and Degrees
for further consideration, This com-
mittee will investigate a permanent
means of meeting the problems by
our current examination schedule,
and hopefully will be able to pre-
sent a solution for the coming spring
semester.

IFC Adopts 63
Rush Schedule

A new 1962 Rush
Week was presented at the IFC
meeting last night. The schedule
was worked out by IFC Rush Chair-
man Tony Schlesinger and members
of the faculty.

The

schedule for

schedule

calls for moving
Freshman Camp up one day and
rushing the dorms on Thursday

night instead of Friday. The change
was made because of an increased
number of placement tests and also
beeause of the confusion of trying
to have shortened classes on the first
day.

Other Facets Unchanged

There will be the usual seventeen
rush dates with the last one ending
at 11:15 on Wednesday night, and
freshmen will still pick up bids
on Friday afternoon and confirm
on Friday night.

The IFC will again participate in
the annual Rockbridge Christmas
Basket. Larry Meeks is chairman of
this project, one of three IFC com-
munity projects, the other two being

the Blood Drive and the Charity
Chest.
The Christmas Basket program

provides over 325 families in Rock-
bridge County with baskets of food
and toys. Funds and food are raised
for the project through letters, a
children’s movie and boxes placed
in food stores.

Welfare Program Underway
Contributions from Washington
and Lee students through the fra-
ternaties provide over one-third of
the funds for this community pro-
ject. The policy of the IFC is for
each member of each house to con-
tribute one dollar to the program.

Forty-Two Booths Installed

 

 

Language Labs Near Completion

The language departments have,

completed installation of the neces-
sary equipment in duPont 102 for
a new language laboratory to be
put into use shortly.

Forty-two language booths have
been erected in duPont; twenty-two
of these are provided with tape re-
corders capable of transmitting and
receiving and twenty are receiving
booths only. Equipment for pro-
jecting slides and showing movies is
also available in the new lab.
Furthermore, there is a variety of
possibilities for the adaptation of
many other teaching aids to the
laboratory.

Planned Use of the Lab

Dr. Linton L. Barrett, head of the
Spanish Department, emphasized
that the lab would be utilized in
large part by students in language
courses involving the spoken lan-
guage. At first, it will supplement
higher, conversational courses whose
class memberships are not too large.

For the rest of the semester, Bar-
rett said, the use of the lab will be
limited. Full use of the language

Alumnus Runs Up
$75 Library Fine

By SHANNON JUNG
Cyrus McCormick has recently in-
tercepted a flagrant violator of the
two week rule on borrowed books.
Mr. O. W. Riegel, head of the
Journalism Department, last week
received a letter from an alumnus
who reported that he had failed to
return a book. The book in question
had been mising from the Journal-
ism Department library for some
time. An approximate guess esti-
mates the date due as “about 1954.”
Apparently interest in the psycho-
logical implications of gossip has de-
creased, for the book entitled The

| Psychology of Rumor has been miss-

ing for only eight years.
Fine of $74

The alumnus, in returning the
book, wrote that he believes the
fine on the book to be $58.63. Mr.
Riegel wrote back that the fine has
gone up and that he actually owes
about $65. Mr. Coleman, head li-
brarian totalled up the fine himself
and arrived at the figure of $74.67.

No report on the interest which
the alumnus has in gossip columns
or other rumor sheets was available.

No Comment from Library

When asked if the fine was re-
ceived and, if so, how it would af-
fect the financial standing of the
library, all Mr. Coleman would
answer was, “No comment.”

The alumnus, preferring to remain
anonymous, failed to give a return
address.

 

lab will begin next semester, to al-
low the language professors time
to become familiar with the opera-
tion of the equipment in the lab.

The idea of a language laboratory
is not a novel one at Washington
and Lee. In 1958, the father of a
Russian student, realizing the con-
tribution of such a lab to the fluency
of the spoken language, donated
some money for the establishment
of a lab.

Conversion of duPont

Dr. Pusey, head of the Russian
Department, then contracted with
Lee Hartman and Sons Company f

W&L Debaters
In Dixie Meet

Bill Noell won two speaking
awards last wekend as he and Ed
Norton represented Washington and
Lee in the Dixie Classic Debate
Tournament at Wake Forest.

Noell won awards of excellence
in debate and in extemporaneous
speaking in a tournament which was
termed “extremely powerful” by
W&L coach W. W. Chaffin.

The W&L team defeated
Indies, Western Michigan, and
George Washington. They lost to
the tournament winner, Wayne
State; to Boston College; and to
debate powerhouse Southern Illinois.

Debate Both Sides

In this tournament the pair de-|

bated both sides of the question in
alternate rounds. There were
schools entered in the two-man di-
vision, including, in addition to
those met by W&L, Holy
Fordham, Wheaton, and Vermont.

Noell Speaks on Castro

As an extemporaneous topic, Noell |

relations with Soviet Russia
cluded three main points to prove

Khrushchev’s difficulty in dealing

realized the need for a lab for
some years. however, the major dif-
faculty in establishing such a teach-
ing aid was primarily financial.
Due largely to President Cole’s in-
terest and concern in this project,
this difficulty has been overcome
and the language lab is now a reali-
ty. Doctors Drake, Turner, L. L.
Barrett, and Westbrook Barritt have
also been instrumental in promot-
ing this project.
Advantages of Equipment

In the new lab, the language in-
structor can hear the recitation of
any one student at any booth. He
can also transmit to any booth sing-
ly or to the whole group collec-
tively. A meter on the master con-
trol board will show him wheather
each person is participating or not.

The lab will demand increased
time from each professor, but Bar-
rett says that the extra demands
will be well worth the effort. He
went on to say that the whole
language department is convinced of
the potential effectivenes of this
new aid.

Cit Petition
Endorsed By
820 Students

By LARRY MEEKS

Almost 80 per cent of the members
of the undergraduate student body
have signed the petition for a more
liberal cut system, according to John
Kirkley. The petition contains 820
signatures out of 1039 undergradu-
ate students here at W&L, and all
of the petitions are still not in. No
law students’ signatures are on the

—y

petitions, as they would not be
effected by any new ruling that

might result.
Executive Committee Acts

According to Student Body Pres-
ident Tim Ireland, the Executive
Committee unanimously approved
the idea of a more liberal cut sys-
tem and appointed a subcommittee
to help Kirkley present the peti-
tions to the faculty in its meeting
last night.

The petition reads, “We the under-
signed students of Washington and
Lee University, have come ‘to feel
that the present system of absence
regulations is too strict and should
be abolished in favor of a new,
more liberal system, constructed
around the outline given below.

Burden of Responsibility

“We know that such a_ system
would place on each of us as indi-
vidual students the burden of great-
er freedom, yet we believe that we
will meet the challenge with greater
responsibility if given this oppor-
tunity to exercise our maturity and
judgment.”

The petition then outlines a pro-
posed system, calling for unlimited
cuts, except before and after the
holidays, for all upperclassmen with
an average of 1.00 or better and one
week of cuts for upperclassmen with
an average below 1.00. For fresh-
men, a 2.00 first semester would be
required for unlimited cuts.

fraternity which was founded at

kKW&L in 1914 selected 12 seniors, 3
juniors, and 5 law students at the
noon-hour assembly. Presiding at
the convocation was Meade Chris-
tian, president of the W&L chapter
of ODK. Christian announced that
the 1964 national convention of the
fraternity will be held at W&L.

ODK membership is extended only
to students who have made signi-
ficant contributions in the fields of
scholarship, athletics, publications,
social and religious affairs, speech,
music and the dramatic arts.

Says Present Era Golden Age

In his speech Dr. Haskins, Presi-
dent of the Carnegie Institution of
Washington, called “profound intel-
lectual revolution” an integral char-
acteristic of our time” and said that
the present period of history “may
one day achieve the title of a Gold-
en Age.”

A new Golden Age, said Haskins,
“will necessarily be deeply concern-
ed with the practical aspects of
the conquest of power from Nature.”
The tremendous challenge offered to
man will create a partnership of “vi-
tality with anxeity and turbulence,”
a characteristic in which “our own
times must superbly qualify as a
Golden Age.”

A “grand revolution in our ways
of looking at the world,” said Has-
kins, “is full upon us—a revolution
which in its power and its scope,
indeed, vividly recalls the explosive
qualities of Copernican times. We
are living,” he added, during a tre-
mendous shift in scientific philoso-
phy,” based on “changes in funda-
mental concepts.”

“‘Absolutes’ And The Honor System

On this page today, we have printed an in-
teview with Dr. Louis Hodges, in which Dr.
Hodges questions the concepts which form
the basis of the Washington and Lee Honor
System. We have printed the article because
we have a very genuine respect for Dr.
Hodges’ opinions; we disagree with him, how-
ever, and would like to express our own opin-
ions on the subject in this editorial.

Dr. Hodges states that the Honor System
here is “operated on the premise that honor
is, in fact, an absolute... .” This assumption,
we believe, is an erroneous one. The Honor
System makes no atempt to define absolute
honor, nor does it require that every W&L
man be a completely honorable man. Like
Dr. Hodges, we doubt the existence of the
completely honorable man, and we would
be hard put to describe an absolute concept of
honor.

If the Honor System does not describe
what honor is, what then does it do? Simply
this: it describes what honor is not. It states,
in no uncertain terms, what an honorable man
does not do: he does not lie, cheat, or steal.
The Honor System assumes that lying, cheat-
ing, and stealing are basically wrong, and that
no combination of biological and psychological
idiosyncrasies can make one of these three acts
honorable.

Strictly speaking, however, it is the stu-
dent body, and not the “Honor System,”
which makes the above assumption. The dis-
tinctive characteristic of the Washington and
Lee Honor System, as compared with other
systems that the bear the same name, is that
to an unparalleled degree it is an Honor Sys-
tem that works. And why does it work? Simp-
ly because the students who choose to attend
W&L subscribe to the tenets of the Honor
System, and these students are not willing to
condone the presence of those who don’t.
If there is an “absolute” in our Honor System,
it is this: for well over a century, and despite
variations and changes in concepts of honor,
the student body at Washington and Lee has
been in almost unanimous agreement that
there is no concept of honor which would in-
clude, or even consider as “relative,” the right
to lie, cheat, or steal.

It follows that, if there is nothing rela-
tive about lying, cheating, and stealing, then

there can be nothing relative about the pen-
alty. If considered from a discplinary or legal
standpoint, the penalty for a violation of the
Honor System is quite often out of all propor-
tion to the actual act. But the Honor System
is not a disciplinary or legal system. Discipli-
nary systems simply demand obedience. An
Honor System demands more—it demands a
high standard of integrity, and it offers to
those who observe this standard innumerable
benefits and privileges which can never be
realized within the confines of a legal system.

When we speak of benefits and privileges,
we are not indulging in meaningless rhetoric:
the benefits of the Honor System are innum-
erable, and anyone who has ever been con-
nected with Washington and Lee will affirm
this statement. These benefits are not to be
taken for granted: their existence depends
entirely on the integrity of each member of
the student body. The individual who fails
to maintain this standard of integrity threatens
the entire system and jeopardizes the privi-
leges of others. To punish such a student with
any penalty less than withdrawal is, in effect,
to excuse his first offense, and to excuse the
first offense is to compromise our own stand-
ards. This compromise, as exemplified at
other institutions, can lead to a mockery of
the Honor System.

No one can claim that any effort is left
unsought to make every student who comes
to this campus aware of what the Honor Sys-
tem is and what it demands. This effort be-
gins in the first approach to him in his secon-
dary school; it is perhaps the single most im-
portant emphasis in all of his orientation, at
Freshman Camp, in subsequent campus meet-
ings, in dorm counselor sessions, in contact
with upper classmen. It is not too much to ask
this question: if a man is so weak as to fail in
the most important requirement that he is
asked to offer here—after every possible effort
has been made to have him become a partici-
pating member of the Washington and Lee
way of life— is not his elimination a justifiable
price to pay for the atmosphere of Honor
which other men of Washington and Lee have
enjoyed for generations, which we enjoy to-
day, and which it is our obligation to preserve
for generations to come?

‘Dishonorable Not To Lie’

 

By DON CASTO
look in June exactly like it did in
1883.

According to Grounds and Build-
ings Superintendent, Douglas Brady,
the intensive work being done on
Lee Chapel is designed not to re-
model but to restore. He said that
workers have encountered a great
many problems in restoration that
would not have normally been en-
countered in remodeling.

The wood flooring and paneling,
for instance, is not being changed.
Every piece of wood has been care-
fully removed, numbered, and stored.
Each piece will be replaced in its
original position after being treated
against decay.

Rotten Wood

It would have been less expensive
and less trouble, Brady said, merely
to use new materials. Some of the
wood had rotted, and this not only
creates a greater expense but also
makes the job of putting it back into
position after restoration “inealcul-
ably more delicate and difficult.”

Brady said a special effort is being
made to duplicate the original color
scheme of the Chapel’s interior. This
is difficult in that no one seems to
know for sure just what the origi-
nal colors were.

Lighting To Be Restored

The workers are trying to dupli-
cate the original lighting and light
fixtures of the Chapel. At the begin-
ning of the restoration the fixtures
were not in their original positions.
Restoration officials are trying to
determine these positions from old
pictures and by close examination of
the building itself. Brady said that
from time to time a worker might
find a small serew hole or a slight

 

indention in the plaster to indicate

If all goes well, Lee Chapel will;

 

| that a light fixture was once there.

In general, Brady said, the object
of the restoration is not merely to
make repairs but to bring the Chapel
as close to its original state as pos-
sible.

No Exterior Changes

He said there will be no major
changes in the exterior of the
Chapel. It will appear exactly as it
was in 1883 when the Lee family
mauseleum was added. The addition
of this erypt is the only major
change that has been made in the
Chapel since its construction in 1867.
Brady said that the only interior
changes have been slight one, such
as the lighting and the painting.

Many unexpected problems arose
in the renovation.

Unexpected Delay

The wooden beams which support-
ed the roof had to be removed to
make way for more structurally
sound steel beams. The contractor
was afraid that the steeple and the
walls of the building would lose
support and might be damaged when
the beams were removed.

Consequently, the steeple

girdled with beams to keep it from
collapsing. This resulted in an un-
expected and costly delay.

Brady mentioned that a big prob-
lem was the fact that a number of
architects are being employed at a
significant cost while the only real
architectural work necessary is in
making a few structural changes.

Building Fireproofed

Brady said many of the changes
will not be readily noticeable.

The entire building, for instance,
is being fireproofed. A new con-
crete floor between the basement
museum and the Chapel will serve
as a fire stop should a fire break out
in either section.

The renovated building will be
be equipped with air-conditioning
which will serve not only to make
those in the building more comfort-
able but also to better preserve the
delicate and decay-prone artifacts
and paintings.

Very Little Decay

Brady said the Chapel was in bet-
ter condition than expected. Experts
had thought the timbers would be
decaying, but the primary damage
they found was some insignificant
boring by post beetles. There was
surprisingly little termite damage
and almost. no serious structural
flaws. The brickwork and masonary
was also in excellent condition,
Brady said, and needed very little
renovation.

In summation, the object of the
restoration is to bring Lee Chapel
as close to its original state, both
structurally and physically, as pos-
sible.

When it is finished in May, Lee
Chapel will look exactly as it did in
1883—and will be just as sturdy as
it was then.

 

The Honor System: Is It Based on a Moral Myth?

(Editor’s note: An editorial com-
ment on the Honor System, express-
ing the editorial view of the subject
held by the Tuesday edition of the

Honor: Is it an absolute ideal?

Dr. Louis Hodges doesn't think so.

In an interview with a Ring-tum
Phi reporter last week, Religion
Professor Hodges sad that honor is
“quite certainly a relative matter.”

“While there is no doubt in any-
one’s mind that we would all agree
on obvious breaches of lying, steal-
ing or cheating, disagreement is
bound to rise on the finer points of
honor.

stanees it would be quite dishonor-

Discussing the practicality of a set
standard of honor, Hodges said that
he “could not conceive of a society
anywhere in which there was one
single person in whom there was ab-

ing.

Explaining, he continued:

“If honor were not relative, there
would be no possibility for disagee-

Disputes Not Possible

“Assuming that every member of
the EC had an equal knowledge
of the facts in any given case, then
it would logically follow that dis-
putes would not be possible—if honor
were absolute.

“But allowance is made for diverse
interpretations of the same facts in
an alleged violation—and this admits
the possibility of differing opinions
as to what constitutes honor.”
Turning to the question of degrees

He next commented on the Honor
System specifically by taking each
of the two words separately.

“The word system,” he said “sug-
gests a means of enforcing specified

“The word honor, on the other
hand, implies some kind of gentle-

W &L Cagers Seek
First Home Win

Against

King Five

Washington and Lee’s basketball team seeks its second win

of the young season tonight at 8 p.m. when it entertains King

College of Bristol.

King represents a tough barrier in*
the injury-plagued Generals’ path
The Bristol boys bowed to a strong
Roanoke College quintet, 73-70, last
week and have scored over 100}
points twice in posting victories.

Washington and Lee, led by super-
star Rodger Fauber, brings a 1-3)
record into the contest.

The Generals lost two games on
a weekend road trip to Old Dominion
College and Randolph-Macon Col-
lege.

Old Dominion pushed their two-
year winning string to 14 games
with a 73-64 triumph Friday night
and Randolph-Macon cruised to a}
76-58 victory after some tough!
early going Saturday night .

At Norfolk, Old Dominion crept|
into a 33-28 halftime lead, but the
Generals remained within striking
distance until 8:00 remained in the
game, when the Monarchs opened
up a ten point margin.

Fauber, hitting seven of ten shots
from the floor paced the Generals’
second half surge. The Lynchburg
senior wound up with 23 points for
the game.

Old Dominion last lost a game
when the Generals whipped them
at W&L midway through the 1961-62
season.

Washington and Lee sank 29 of
63 shots from the floor against the
Monarchs for 46 per cent. Old
Dominion hit 30 for 78 for 38.2 per
cent.

The taller Monarchs outrebounded
the Generals, 53-42, and thus gained
the upper hand in the game.

Conference team picked Dee. 5 by
the four head coaches of the College

| Athletic Conference.

Conference runner-up Sewanee
three men on the all-star
squad, while two players from Cen-
tre College were honored.

Tie votes at two positions—end
and back—resulted in an out-sized
listing for the new conference’s first
all-conference selections.

Six players were unanimous
choices, including two players from
Centre College which failed to win
a conference game. The top vote-
getters included quarterback Bob
Hourigan and guard Ron Kimber-
lin of Centre, tackle John Turner
and end Bob Davis of Sewanee, and

 

 

Tommy Keesee

Stuart Yofle of Washington and Lee.

Other all-conference choices were
ends John Madison of Washington
and Lee and John Asheraft of South-
western, guard Challence McMillin
center Doug Meeks of Southwestern,
tailback M. L. Agnew of Sewanee,
fullback Tommy Keesee of Wash-
ington and Lee and halfback Bill
Harwood of Southwestern.

Three Generals, Payne, Madison,
and Keesee, received additional hon-
ors last week when they were named
to the Virginia All-Small College
team. W&L along with Emory and
Henry and Hampden-Sydney placed
three men on the squad.

Junior end Buck Ogilvie, senior
tackle Phil McCaleb, senior quarter-

back Chuck Lane, and Yoffe re-
ceived honorable mentions.

conference total offense leader with
league leading rushing and passing
marks of 538 yard: on 119 carries
and 501 yards on 37 pass completions
from 87 attempts. He hit on four
scoring passes.

Centre’s Bob Hourigan was a
triple-threat quarterback who hurt
opponents with his passing running,
and effective ball handling. He also
was the conference punting leader
averaging 33.8 yards a kick.

Gaining pins in the
final two matches, Washington and
Lee’s wrestling team rolled to a 26-

Saturday night.

Sophomore Butch West wasted no
time in giving the Generals a 5-0
lead in their quest for a_ third
straight win without a loss. West
took his opponent, Charles Dickin-
son, down and pinned him in 1:47 of
the first period.

Senior tri-captain Dave Mont-
gomery, in the 130-pound weight
class, upped the W&L lead to 10-0
when he pinned Larry Crubley at
0:36 into the second period.

Pfeiffer earned its six points in
the 137 and 157 classes.

Arthur Merrion scored a
down and a reversal to take
lead into the third period against
freshman Jerry Reeves, but Reeves
gave Merrion a run for his money,
scoring a reversal, an escape, and
a take down in the final three min-
utes. Merrion’s final margin
9-5.

Nina Simone Here For Fancy Dress Concert

N ovelist Scheduled

To Lecture

January 11

By JIM LEDBETTER
News Editor

Reynolds Price, a young An
was published to wide acclaim

rerican writer whose first novel
earlier this year, will speak at

Washington and Lee under the auspices of the Seminars in

literature.

His talk is scheduled for 8:15 p.m. January 11 in the Fine

Arts Auditorium, duPont Hall. Like*
all Seminars in Literature sessions, |
it will be open to the public with-
out charge.

Price, a native of North Caro-
lina, is the author of “A Long and
Happy Life,’ a short novel pub-
lished last spring by Atheneum.
Its publication in book form coin-
cided with its appearance, full-
length, in Harper’s Magazine, This
was the first time in its history
that Harper's had published an
entire novel in a single issue.

The novel won almost unanimous
praise from reviewers and critics on
its publication and has been nomi-
nated for the National Book Award
for 1962. Such figures of the literary
world as Stephen Spender, Lord
David Cecil, and Eudora Welty
singled it out for special comment
and commendation.

Spender said: “I think this is

the most remarkable novel by a
young writer which I have read
for many years. It is a most mov-

ing and disturbing love story, told
with compelling observation, sharp
and original humor, and deep feel-

Price was born in 1933 and gradu-
ated from Duke University in 1955
For the next three years he attend-
ed Oxford University as a Rhodes
Scholar. He received his Bachelor
of Letters degree from Oxford in
1958 He returned to teach at Duke,

Student Literary Magazine
Makes Debut On Campus

By JULIAN MARKHAM

Ariel, a literary review writ-

ten and published by Wash-| liam B. Lowry, Jr.;

ington and Lee students, made
its campus debut this Wednes- |
day.

Published entirely without | tion, contributor Bill Lowry com-

either faculty supervision or |
University financial assistance,
the first issue of Ariel com-
pletes several months of fund
raising, organization, and _lit-
erary effort by Editor and

and his staff.

Refo commented in the first edition
that the continued publication of
Ariel was assured “through the gen-
erous support of the University,
both students and faculty; through

 

the support of neighboring colleges, |

and through advertisements.”
Focus

The focus of the Autumn issue of
Ariel is the “Theatre of the Absurd.”
This, and allied aspects of the ab-
surd in politics and philosophy are
discussed in the issue. The maga-
zine’s content also includes book re-
views and poetry as well as a report

| on the recent American Poetry Fes-

tival.

THE NEW language laboratory in duPont Hall.

‘ Significance
Business Manager John Refo|

Ariel’s contributors include: John |

| F. Refo; Andrew Adelson; C. P.
| White, Jr.; Franklin Carlisle; Wil-
Tim Morton;

Phillip Reidford; and John Dunnell.
| All are seniors at Washington and
| Lee.

When asked about Ariel’s recep-

mented that: “A lot of people are
very encouraged to see something
like this.” Lacking specific data as
to circulation and reviews, he could
only infer, from personal conversa-
tion, that the public respense has
been warm.

 

Discussing the significance of Ariel |
in relation to other publications on |
campus, Lowry stated that whereas
a surprising number of Washington |
and Lee students write, they “have |

no outlet, and receive little en-
couragement with the exception of
the English Department’s Mahan
Awards. Therefore, Ariel fills a def-
inite need.” Speaking of his belief
that a great deal of latent student
interest exists “in this sort of thing,”
Lowry said that a “publication such
as Ariel should help to bring it out.”
When asked about Ariel’s future,
Lowry answered for Refo, who is
taking Rhodes Scholarship Exams in
Charlottesville today, saying that
two additional issues will be pub-
lished this year. The first of these
he said, would probably use stu-
dent fiction as its main theme.
Students interested in purchasing
copies of Ariel may do so either at
the Co-op or the Book Shop. Sub-

scriptions are still available and may
be obtained by contacting either)
John Refo or Bill Lowry.

To Perform With Trio

By STEVE GUILD
Managing Editor

Nina Simone, jazz pianist and singer, has been signed by

the Dance Board for the Fancy Dress Concert, February

?

rar

The concert, which will be held in Doremus Gymnasium
from 8 to 10 Saturday night will feature both Miss Simone and

Conservative
Society Holds
Meeting Here

Approximately 60 students from
Virginia colleges attended the “Con-
ference on Conservatism” sponsored
by the Washington and Lee Conser-
vative Society on this campus last
week. Delegates at the conference
included those from W&L, Hollins,
Randolph-Macon Men and Women’s
colleges, Sweetbriar, and UVa.

In the afternoon, the Eastern Di-
rector of the Intercollegiate Society
of Individualists, Robert Lucock,
spoke on the purpose and function
of his organization, and on _ the
founding of ISI-affiliated college or-
ganizations. Discussion groups led
by Wyatt Durette and Joe Freeman,
Presidents of the W&L and UVa.
Conservative Societies respectively,
and by Bill Braithwaite, Managing
Editor of W&L’s Southern Conser-
vative, followed.

Following a banquet at the Robert
E. Lee Hotel, Dr. Gordon Tullock,
economics professor at UVa.., spoke
on “The Rift Between Russia and
Red China.” Dr. Tullock envisioned
a “steadily developing emotional
hatred” developing between these
two countries. Tullock said _ that
this was attributable to three basic

facts: 1) Red China’s traditional
role as “junior partner” in the re-
lation between Russia and China;

2) Mao Tse-tung’s resentment at this
surbordination and his determina-
tion to obtain leadership; and 3) the
constant dispute of Russia and China
over the Siberian and Manchurian
boarders.

Dr. Tullock also pointed out ap-
parent “signs of mental decay in Mao
Tse-tung and the Red Chinese gov-
ernment which has been “exempli-
fiied by a steady decline in her gross
national product over the last four
years.” The proper course for the
United States is to attempt to widen
the Russia- Chinese breach.

 

—*her trio.

The appearance of Nina Simone
coincides with the rest of the Fancy
Dress activities which include the
“Playboy” cocktail party Friday
afternoon and the Civil War Fancy
Dress Ball with Count Basie and his
orchestra and Stan Rubin and the
Tigertown Five Friday night.

The voice of Nina Simone caught
the ear of the listening public dur-
ing the summer of 1959, and since
that time she has had meteoric
rise. On records, her albums, “The
Amazing Simone” and “Little Girl
Blue,” became national best sellers
and her singles “I Love You Porgy”
and “Children Go Where I Send
You,” remain high on the charts.

Miss Simone was born in a small
North Carolina town and her only
early musical experience was sing-
ing and playing the organ in the lo-
cal church. A few years later she
began taking classical music lessons
which led to her studying a year at
the Juilliard School of Music in New
York. Here she studied piano and
theory with Carl Friedberg.

Although Nina Simone’s
background was primarily in the
classical field, she began taking a
greater interest in jazz and develop-
ed a flair for improvising. This, plus
the fact that her musie studio busi-
ness was poor during the summer,
led to a booking in an Atlantic City
night club. In this job she gained
the reputation as a fine jazz pianist
and a popular singer. At the end of
the summer she decided to give up

a

musical

her music studio and devote full
time to trying to carve out a career
in show business.

For the next two years she work-
ed in small clubs and appeared on
television shows in and around Phil-
adelphia. From the time she made
her first record, Nina’s career has
moved at a dizzying pace. Her rec-
ords have hit the best-selling lists,
bookings poured in and the enter-
tainment world hailed her as the
musical find of the year.

Nina Simone has performed at the
Round Table, the Village Gate, the
Village Vanguard, Town Hall, Car-

Faculty Resolution On Exams

The action taken by the faculty on the proposed changes in
examination schedules is most encouraging. While the reso-
lution passed has no concrete meaning, it does show that there
is interest in and concern over the matter.

The resolution, as passed by the faculty, merely requests
that professors “try to avoid the scheduling of hour quizzes
in the last week of classes in this semester.” In itself, this does
not say much. The same old problem exists. That is, a student
can still be caught in a bind if his examination schedule hap-
pens to fall the wrong way.

While many of the original proposals were not granted,
the fact that the matter was referred to the Committee on
Courses and Degrees for further study is heartening. We hope
that this will result in some workable and acceptable program
in the near future.

It is our hope that this matter will not be lost in some
remote pigeonhole. The problem has been aired and solu-
tions have been offered. We hope that a permanent solution
can be made before the final examinations in the spring.

The Cut System Petition

The recently circulated petition by John Kirkley shows
that there is great student interest in some form of change in
our present cut system. So far, almost 80 per cent of the stu-
dent body has signed the petition that supports a liberalization
of the existing regulations.

In addition, the Executive Committee received the petition
and gave their unanimous support to the idea of a more liberal
cut system. A committee is now preparing to present this pe-
tition to the faculty.

While the chances of having unlimited cuts for everyone
with a one point average are remote, almost any change in
the present system would be welcome. As the system now exists,
severe academic penalties are given for unexcused absences.
This seems unfair when a student is forced to drop a course with
a failing grade because of an unexcused absence.

It may be argued that the student body is unable to accept
the responsibility of a more liberal cut system. In some cases
this may be true, but some attempt should be made to explore
the possibilities of such a system. If this would still be too
liberal, something should be done to look into the problems
of the severe penalties given for over-cutting. Here, a social
penalty rather than an academic penalty could possibly be
exacted,

It is most evident that the student body is concerned with
the evils of the existing system and that some change should

be made. We hope that this will be done.

A Holiday Message

Holidays are almost upon us again, and most of us will
spend some portion of our time driving from place to place,
party to party, etc. With this in mind, we offer the following
reminder:

ols
W

IN THE NAME OF MODERN ART

We are seriously considering painting one of those highly
modernistic pictures, using new and way-out techniques. The
idea we consider sane, and we've already got a title: Painting
On Asphalt.

We can see it now—the blended shades from the modern
pastels automobile manufacturers are putting on their cars
now. In fact, salmon pink and perhaps turquoise blue would
be nice, to symbolize both sexes. Throw in white trim on one,
black somewhere, and we have universality of races.

We’ll mass the colors into two convergent blobs, balled up
as though someone had taken two hunks of colored clay and
smashed them together at a high velocity. We'll put them on
a black background, and send a stream of light, a sort of beam,
flashing askew from one of them. Somewhere off to one side
we'll have a red light, painted in tones to simulate flashing.

We'll add brilliant crimson blotches around the central
figures, and somewhat below them. Spread it on liberally, we
have plenty of it. And throw in some little sparkles of light, like
lights flashing on glass which has been shattered and spread on
a hard surface. And we'll throw in some smaller, cylindrical
objects, painted in many hues and labeled neatly with weird
names like ‘Black Label,’’ ‘‘Pabst,”’ ‘Budweiser,’ etc. Those
should provide a colorful touch.

On second thought, why bother to go to the trouble of
painting this picture at all? It would just be extra work. We'd
merely be copying a common scene which could and does ap-
pear quite often on our highways.

Symposia . . .

 

By BILL KINSEY

Grading, it has been agreed by
many prominent educators, destroys
_ the use of testing.
Testing in itself is
a fine method of
teaching provided
that the tests are
corrected but not
F graded. The whole
mechanism of
grades tends to
substitute false
goals as the aim of
= studies, i.e., Dean’s
er List, unlimited
esta cuts, Honor Roll,
etc. Essentially, tests should be used
by the professors to find out what

they are failing to get across.
Why then are grades necessary?
The explanation will be that they
are needed to determine progress,
admissions to graduate school, schol-
arships, advice to employers, and

 

 

the like. But there are schools that

have modified grading systems and

some schools which do not grade
at all. Reed College, for example,
does grade, but the grades are never
published to the students. Sarah
Lawrence, on the other hand, does
not grade at all; but they manage
to do quite well on the basis of
recommendations. However, there
is one quite strong implication which
arises in this case and in others
like it. In order for this system to
be successful, it would be necessary
for the faculty to know the students
personally, discuss them, and even
argue about them. Is this beyond
our faculty? Does the present sys-

tem deter and even in some cases

prohibit a close professor-student
relationship?

By KEN LANE |
Assistant Managing Editor

For the reader who is fed up with’
the unexciting particulars of every-
day reality, we suggest a space-
launch into the more stimulating
cosmosphere of what is commonly
called “philosophy.” Here, from our
orbiting satellite, we can view our
beloved Mother Earth in peace,
without fear of hurting anyone’s
feelings.

(For those of you who are dis-
concerted, this introduction is merely
a twentieth-century mode of invok-
ing the Muse, establishing the atmos-
phere, or what have you.)

Still with us, are you? Naturally
when you're up this high the fitting
thing to do, regardless of your nor-
mal mental habits, is to philoso-
phize. For at this height, the world
is too small to deal with anything
but overall generalities.

If you are like most people, you
have begun with the easiest sub-
ject of all—the well-known homo
sapiens. In actuality, you couldn't
have picked a duller topic! But
since you conveniently brought
the subject up, and it’s a subject
few can avoid, we have a few
philosophical remarks we'd like to
include.

We say it’s a dull topic. Without
insulting the human race too much,
we should like to explain our-
selves. We live, you know, in the era
of the “common man”; our society
is that of the “organization man,”
a homogeneous society, its members
easily adjusting to the whole.

What is missing in all this, we
confess, is the individual, once the
basic unit of our dear society. Philo-
sophically peering down from our
satellite, we see night descending
on the age of heroes, the Alexanders
and Caesars. Where today are the
Abraham Lincolns, the Winston
Churchills, the Joseph Stalins, the
Albert Einsteins which were present
in past years?

If we want to be further dis-
couraged about this, we shall per-
mit one of those professional phil-
osophers aboard our craft and
hear what Arthur Schlesinger has
to say. “Our contemporary socie-
ty,” he recently commented in
Perspective magazine, “has little
use for the individual. Individual-
ism implies dissent from the group;
dissent implies conflict; and con-
fiict suddenly seems divisive, un-
American, and generally unbear-
able.”

With splendid success, Americans
are launching a “conspiracy against
creativity,” as Schlesinger describes
it. “For our national apotheosis of
the group means that we systematic-
ally lop off the eccentries, the origi-
nals, the proud, imaginative, lonely
people from whom new ideas come.”

Today we live in the world of
“togetherness,” do we not? All we
ask for is peace of mind. Conflict and
disharmony simply don’t fit into our
scheme of doing things. We ask:
Are there any individuals today who
sharply affect our lives or our way
of thinking? Are there any out-
standing figures today who are shap-
ing our destiny or channeling the
course of history, or is it the “gov-
ernment,” the “science laboratory,”
the “church”?

If we have lost our rugged indi-

 

 

vidualism, our independence of

The Loss Of Individualism
Viewed As Serious Threat

mind, then we must philosophic-
ally conclude that our cherished
principles of democracy and free
society are without foundation.
For once the individual succumbs
to the popular stereotype, he no
longer utilizes freedom of choice.
He acts not by his own decisions,
but by the decisions made for him
by the thing called society.

And so to sum up our discourse,
we once again turn to Mr. Schlesing-
er: “If we are to survive, we must
have ideas, vision, courage. These

(Continued on page 4)

 

European models such as the Uni-
versity of Bologna or the school of
liberal arts in Paris. These European
models all had one thing in com-
mon: in these communities of schol-
ars, teaching and learning could only
be a personal relationship. The stu-
dent worked closely with his masters
in every phase of study. And it was
the principal master himself who
conferred the honor on the student
which signified the act of Com-
mencement. This honor came only
after the student had given a con-
vincing demonstration of his ability
to perform an adult job of work.
How do we go about creating an at-
mosphere that will foster such per-
sonal relationships?

Obviously, the first step is to
restrict the size of the institution.
Experts in the field have made
suggestions as to the size of the
ideal college ranging anywhere
from 300 students on up. Many of
the older liberal arts colleges
which started out with student
bodies somewhere in this small
range have grown considerably
larger. Amherst and Swarthmore
are good points in_ illustration.
Something of an arbitrary limit
has grown up, however, and this
seems to hover about the 1200
mark. So, in this department we
are in good shape. We have the
basic structure in which to work.

The small size of the college has
often been cited as a means of es-
caping the impersonal mass approach
to education. Here, at Washington
and Lee, we have an innovation
that has the potential to make edu-
cational a personal experience I
speak now of the Honors Program.
The Program is designed “to en-
courage independent work, scholarly
investigation and intellectual curio-

 

Recommendations, Not Grades
Should Indicate Student’s Work

sity among students.” And, proper-
ly applied, I am sure that this pro-
gram would do just what it pur-
ports to do,

Too Late

The problem is that it comes too
late in the school career to do the
maximum good. The Program may
only be used by seniors. Does this
imply that sophomores and juniors,
and even freshmen, are incapable of
independent work, scholarly inves-
tigation, and intellectural curiosity,
that these are the perrogatives of
seniors only? Or does it mean
merely that underclassmen must
postpone such until their senior
year? Certainly it is the latter.

I suggest such a program for the
under classes. When the student’s
mind is still open to a number of
fields, this is the time that inde-
pendent work and _ investigation
serve the greatest purpose. Re-
search should be continuous
throughout the four years of the
undergraduate education.

True, the existing Honors Pro-
gram for seniors allows the student
to delve deeply into one particular
field or one segment of a field, an
appropriate way to cap four years of
college; but there is no program that
allows research and comprehensive
examination of several fields, related
or unrelated as they may be, in the
other classes. Such a program is de-
sirable. It would serve to set up a
close student-professor relationship
as early as the first semester of the
freshman year and enable this re-
lationship to continue for four years.
The student and the faculty mem-
bers with whom he would be work-
ing closely would get to know one
another much better than is present-
ly possible.

Cruelties Of Our Cut System:
The Tragedy Of Tom Jones

By JIM LEDBETTER
News Editor

Tom Jones came to Washington
and Lee armed with a suit, a cata-
logue, and a desire to please. He
wore his suit every day and read
his catalogue every night. There
were many things in this little vol-
ume that pleased him, even if he
didn’t understand them; and there
were a few things that didn’t please
him. He never worried about these
things, though, for he realized that
he was merely a freshman and had
to be guided down the way of life.

One of the things that pleased
Tom was the section titled “Ab-
sense Regulations.” “After all,” he
said, “what did I come to school
for?” He looked in the mirror and
a little voice answered him: “ To
go to class.”

So Tom went to class. He had to,
for he only had one cut per class
and he was saving them to go home
one weekend. Some of his classes he
liked and in some he went to sleep.
He felt very badly about going to
sleep in class but there was noth-
ing he could do about it, for some
of his professors were the type
that are reputed to be on 24-hour
call for research by sleeping-pill
manufacturers. One of them re-
peated the textbook vebatim; an-
other spoke in a monotone that even
put the flies to sleep. However, Tom
had the satisfaction of knowing that
at least he went to class.

At the end of the first semester
Tom was rewarded for his hard work
with a 1.896 average. Consulting his
dog-eared catalogue, he found that
he was entitled to a week of cuts
in each class. He found this inter-
esting, though of course he had no
desire to miss class.

One morning, however, Tom
woke up sick. He had an 8:25 class
that morning but he was feeling
so bad that he couldn't even go to
the infirmary. He turned over and
slept through his classes. Some-
where in the depths of the incom-
prehensible workings of his benev-
olent institution, someone chuckled
and a little mark went down.
When he woke up in the afternoon
he was feeling better but when
he went to the infirmary his plea
for an excuse was turned down.
“You have to come here before
your classes,” they informed him,
“and anyway you look all right to

”

us.

 

But Tom remembered that he had
cuts, so everything was fine. He
wondered what would have hap-
pened to him if he had been sick
the first semester; but this didn’t
worry him too much, because it
hadn't happened.

A month later, Tom was faced with
two hour quizzes and a paper on
one day. He kept up with his work
all along, but being a conscientious
student he wanted to do his best on
them. He decided to cut one of his
classes and study. As it turned out,
the professor had merely taken role
and dismissed the class so he could
finish a paper entitled “Means and
Ways to Stop the Alarming Rise of
No-Doze Tablets.”

The next day, Tom’s great-grand-
father died. He was in such a hurry
to get to the funeral that he forgot

 

to clear his absence through the
proper channels. However, since he
still had some cuts left, he was not
worried. He came back three days
later and found that his relation-
ship with the University had been
severed.

Tom went and talked to people,
but they wouldn't listen to him.
For days he beat on the doors
behind which things happen, but
to no avail. He was too ashamed to
face his parents, so he stayed in
his room until they kicked him
out.

But of course this was many years
ago. Tom grew a beard, and faded
quietly into the town where he can
still be seen now and then, his suit
wrinkled and full of holes, standing
in an old doorway and watching
people pass by.

Loyola And American Defeat Tankmen;
Bokinsky And Wolfe Top Team Scoring

By NICK MONSARRAT
The Washington and Lee swim-
ming team didn’t get any favors this
week as they dropped two away—
meets against American University
and Loyola College by decisive mar-

gins, bringing their season record
to 1-3.
Against Loyola of Baltimore it

was power and depth that crushed
the Generals as W&L was held to
only two victories and a host of
third places for an unexpected de-
feat, 67-28.

A poor start in the backstroke
portion of the 400-yard medley re-
lay squelehed that event for the
Generals against American Univer-
sity, and marked the first of a series
of close races which left W&L on
the short end of a 51-44 score.

In the near freezing waters only
freshman Don Casto and the final
relay were able to break the Loy-
ola monoply on first places. Casto
bettered the field of four in the
50-yard freestyle in 24.1, while
the 400-yard freestyle team of
Jahneke, Hart, Monsarrat, and
Casto won in 3:52.0.

The usually victorious John Wolfe
was forced to take a back seat to
the Loyola distance men in both the
200 and 500-yard freestyle events as
both men were clocked under 2:04
for the 200 and 6:00 for the longer
race,

Freshman Bo Bokinsky managed
second places in both the 200-yard
individual medley and the 200-yard
breaststroke events to show promise
of better things to come.

The tepid waters of the Amer-

 

ican University pool provided relief
from the cold of Loyola but none
from the sting of defeat. Bokinsky
and classmate John Lifter gave the
Generals the first two places in the
200-yard breaststroke and Wolfe
took first in the distance events, but
the remainder of the day saw W&L
only lose close races.

Walt McManus led for nine laps
in the 200-yard butterfly only to
lose by inches. John Lifter pre-
ceded this performance with one
of his own in the 200-yard
individual medley with a similar
result. In the 100-yard freestyle
Durham saw two tenths of a sec-
ond place position.

The final relay of Durham, Chase,
Jahneke, and Grant closed out the
meet with a win in 3:50.0.

After a total of four meets Fresh-
man Bo Bokinsky leads the Generals
in scoring with thirty points while

 

  
  
      
  
   

  

John Wolfe trails with twenty-
seven.

Tom Stover Named Sports Star;

Coach Miller calls Stover a fine

Stover’s record last season in-

His overall record as a W&L wrest-

Miller praises Tom for his handi-

DECK THE HALLS

When you think of Christmas gifts you naturally think of
Marlboro cigarettes, leading seller in flip-top box in all fifty
states—and if we annex Wales, in all fifty-one—and if we an-
nex Lapland—in all fifty-two. This talk about annexing Wales
and Lapland is, incidentally, not just idle speculation. Great
Britain wants to trade Wales to the United States for a desert.
Great Britain needs « desert desperately on account of the
tourist trade. Tourists are always coming up to the Prime
Minister or the Lord Privy Seal or like that and saying, “I’m
not knocking your country, It’s very quaint and
picturesque, ete. what with Buckingham Palace and Bovril
and Seotland Yard, ete., but where’s your desert?” (Before I
forget, let me point out that Scotland Yard, Britain’s plain-
clothes police branch, was named after Wally Scotland and
Fred Yard who invented plain clothes. The American. plain-
clothes force is called the FBI after Frank B. Incheliff, who
invented fingerprints. Before Mr. Incheliff’s invention, every-
body’s fingers were absolutely glassy smooth. This, as you
may imagine, played hob with the identification of newborn
babies in hospitals. From 1791 until 1904 no American parent

mind you.

ever brought home the right baby from the hospital. This
later became known as the Black Tom Explosion.)

But I digress. England, I was saying, wants to trade Wales
for a desert. Sweden wants to trade Lapland for Frank B. Inch-
cliff. The reason is that Swedes to this day still don’t have
fingerprints. As a result, identification of babies in Swedish
hospitals is so haphazard that Swedes flatly refuse to bring their
babies home. There are, at present, nearly a half-billion un-
claimed babies in Swedish hospitals—some of them well over
eighty years old.

But I digress. We were speaking of Christmas gifts which
naturally put us in mind of Marlboro cigarettes. What could
be more welcome at Christmas time than Marlboro’s flavor,
Marlboro’s soft pack, Marlboro’s flip-top box? What indeed
would be more welcome at any time of year—winter or sum-
mer, rain or shine, night or day? Any time, any season, when
you light a Marlboro you can always be certain that you will
get the same mild, flavorful, completely comfortable smoke.

There are, of course, other things you can give for Christmas
besides Marlboro cigarettes. If, for example, you are looking
for something to give a music lover, let me call to your atten-
tion a revolutionary new development in phonographs—the
Low-fi phonograph. The Low-fi, product of years of patient
research, has so little fidelity to the reeord you put on it that if,
for instance, you put “Stardust” on the turntable, ‘Melancholy
Baby” will come out. This is an especially welcome gift for
people who have grown tired of “Stardust”

Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night.

The makers of Marlboro cigarettes, who take pleasure in

Beneficial Results

The beneficial results of such a
system could be manifold. Conscien-

for dropping the rigmarole of com-

actually know him. And, further-
more, it would relieve the student
of all the loolish pressures now put
upon him by an inflexible grading
system, the grades being replaced
by recommendations based on re-
search and personal conferences and
the individual student’s outlook. The
professor’s role of impersonal arbi-
ter would be replaced by one of a
counseling friend.

To be sure, such a system here
proposed is based on ideals; but I
feel that it could be made workable
in a significant sense. The final step,
of course, would be the attractive
one of working out a friendly ar-
rangement whereby graduate and
professional schools, competing for
good students, would accept these
students on the basis of their merits
as set forth in the recommendations
of their teachers, rather than on
the artificial standard of grades.

Washburn
Opens Fund
Campaign

By SHANNON JUNG

The Annual Alumni Fund drive
has just been kicked off by the
Alumni Association, Alumni Secre-
tary W. C. Washburn announced
yesterday.

One vital necessity for the success
of the Fund Drive this year is get-
ting more and more alumni to par-
ticipate as contributors. The Fund
Council has set its sights high by
anticipating 100 per cent participa-
tion from the University’s 11,000
alumni.

The class agencies in various cities
haven't begun work yet, as the Cam-
paign gets underway in reality at
the beginning of the new year. The
alumni office is now busy preparing
letters for these class agents.

In connection with the fund drive,
the Alumni Association intends to
use desk pieces made of nails from
Lee Chapel embedded in clear plas-
tic.

Lee Chapel Nails

In restoring the Chapel, one step
taken to insure its permanence in-
volved replacing the wooden beams
and trusses of the roof with steel.
Many of the spikes and nails used
in the original construction are
unsuitable for re-use, and a large
number of these historical items
have been collected and saved.

Recognizing that many persons
would like to have a souvenir nail
from historic Lee Chapel, the Uni-
versity gave the Alumni Associa-
tion the prerogative of using the
nails. Some sort of co-ordination
with the Alumni Fund was a possi-
bility.

As the W&L Alumni Magazine
states, “In examining the Lee Chapel
nails, it is easy to draw an analogy
between the sturdy iron pegs which
helped support and continue to sup-
port Lee Chapel and the solid, de-
pendable and loyal alumni whose
annual contributions to the Alumni
Fund support the University in such
an important way.”

“Not for Promotion”

“Not at all a commercial enter-
prise”; Washburn stated, “there will
probably be enough nails for those
alumni who show interest in the
project by promoting the Campaign.”
There will obviously not be enough
nails for each alumnus to have
one; therefore, their distribution will
probably be on a first-come, first-
serve basis.

The criteria for distribution will
be a matter for decision at the next
Alumni Fund Council meeting. It
seems likely that the nails can play
an important part in furthering the
attainment of the objectives of the
Fund Campaign.

Plans for the distribution of the
desk pieces, as paper weights, from
the Lee Chapel nails are still in the
formative stage, although they are
an integral part in the Alumni Fund
Campaign of '62-’63.

Best Wishes
From Hairy
On Christmas

An as yet unidentified beast is
moving its slow thighs toward the
cradle to be born. When it is, it
will take the form of the 1963
Southern Collegian, Fancy Dress
version.

At the present time, Hairy is
preparing to put his flies into harness
and deliver a few Christmas goodies
to deserving Collegian staff mem-
bers—a bottle of Jack Daniels here,
Old Taylor there.

In reality, the entire Collegian
staff joins with the Tuesday Ring-
tum Phi staff members (see edi-
torial, page 2) in wishing the stu-
dents and faculty of Washington
and Lee University a happy holiday
and a very hairy Christmas.

‘NEWS BRIEFS

IFC Contributes To Rockbridge Christmas Basket Fund

Over $450 has been donated to the Rockbridge Christmas Basket Fund
to date by the fraternities through the IFC. Four fraternities have not
yet turned in checks for the annual charity drive.

This contribution combined with others from the community will be
used to provide over 350 families with Christmas baskets and toys. The
UCA also participates in this program by taking up a collection for it at
their annual Candlelight Service which was held this past Sunday in
R. E. Lee Memorial Church.

 

Blood Donation Requires Parental Consent

In last night’s IFC meeting, Blood Drive Chairman Freddy Cooper
distributed letters to the representatives of each house. Attached to each
letter is a card to be signed by parents of sons under twenty-one giving
their consent for their sons to donate blood in the annual Blood Drive.

Lack of parental consent has been one of the major problems in the
Blood Dive, but this should be solved by the cards and postage-paid
envelopes attached to each letter.

Alumni Set $115,000 Goal For Fund Drive

The goal of this year’s Alumni Association Fund Drive is $115,000, it
was announced today by W&L Information Services. The amount is $15,-
000 higher than the mark sought last year. Donald M. Fergusson, a 1951
graduate who lives in Richmond, is chairman of the 1962-63 Alumni Fund
Council, a six-man group charged with directing the annual drive for the
Alumni Association.

Seminar In Literature To Feature Reynolds Price

The 43rd program in Washington and Lee’s Seminars in Literature
series will be presented January 11 when Reynolds Price, a young novel-
ist and member of the Duke University faculty, speaks here. A former
Rhodes Scholar, Price is the author of A Long and Happy Life, which has
been nominated for the 1962 National Book Award and is the first entire
novel to be printed in one issue of Harper’s Magazine.

More Fancy Dress Costumes Coming After Christmas
A new supply of Fancy Dress costumes will be available after Christmas
at a date to be announced later in the Ring-tum Phi, Dance Board Vice
President Ed Croft said today. Due to a record demand for costumes
this year, the FD costume stock is presently exhausted.
The Oak Hill Cap and Gown Company of Roanoke is getting the new
costumes, according to Croft.

Candlelight Service Given New Format This Year
The University Christian Association Candlelight Service was held last
Sunday evening and was attended by a capacity audience again this year.
Rather than familiar carols and sermons, the program consisted of nine
scripture readings and old carols, most traditional English hymns. The
Glee Club and the John A. Graham Choir led the music.
The form of the service is known as the Festival of Nine Lessons and
Carols, and is drawn from ancient sources. It was given its present form
in 1918 at King’s College, Cambridge, where it is annually presented.

Red, White, Blue Banners Carry A Message

The pennons flying daily on the grass in front of the library are placed |

out by the ROTC department to inform cadets of instructions concerning

The red guidon signifies that cadets will not wear overcoats with their

W&L has the respondent’s side
and SMU the petitioner’s side, and
the case concerns the right of the
accused to have legal counsel in the
pre-trial hearing as well as in court.

W&L’s representatives to the reg-
ional Moot Court are chosen each
spring in the Burks Competition.
Twenty-four students entered last
year’s contest.

For the past two years Clark has
won the Burks Medal, the award for
the outstanding speaker in the Burks
Competition, and he tied with Terry
Cooper of U. Va. for the best single
speaker of the regional competition
held earlier this year in Richmond.
Clark is a senior law student, an
ODK, and his legal
Phi Delta Phi.

Rose is the only member of the
team that did not do his undergradu-
ate work at W&L. He is a gradu-
ate of Cornell, an ODK, a member of
Phi Delta Phi, and is the senior law
class representative to the Execu-
tive Committee.

Partington is an intermediate law
student, an ODK, and a member of
Phi Alpha Delta.

The regional judging is run slight-
ly different to the national in that

there is no separate judging for
briefs and presentation. A_ single
award is made for the team that

made the best showing in both.

In the regional competition W&L
defeated both Duke and South Car-
olina, but lost to U. Va. in the final
round. They will however, start on
“equal footing’ in the New Yor
competition.

resolution that the free nations of the world should establish
c ——* an economic community, were given

the win over the heavily-favored
first string pair by Mr. John Gunn
of the Commerce School. He judged
that Noell and Eckes had piled up
more speaking points, as expected,
but that Norton and Boardman had
won the debate on its technical is-
sues.

The match, held before a number
of faculty members and _ students,
was a warm up for the Atlantic
Coast Conference Championship
Tournament which the team will
enter immediately after the Christ-
mas holidays.

The loss was particularly ironic
for Noell and Eckes because their
opponents were presenting a case
which had been prepared by Eckes.
Mr. Gunn said, in announcing the
decision following the debate, that
Eckes had written a case too strong
for him to crack. He commented that
the level of “technical competence”
was the highest he had ever seen in
a college debate.

Boardman opened the debate by
presenting two needs for the estab-
lishment of the community. He
pointed out the need for unity
against communism, and the need
for economic stability. If these two
needs could be solved, he said, the
communist threat could be halted,
and the underdeveloped nations of
the world would be able to build
up to higher economic levels.

Eckes was the first negative speak-
er, and began his attack by chal-
lenging definitions and attempting
to prove that an economic commun-
ity could not solve the need for
unity and stability. He also argued
that underdeveloped countries would
find it financially impossible to join
an economic community because of
the power of the more advanced
nations.

The second affirmative speaker,
Norton, presented a plan which was,
in essence, that of a customs union.
His plan called for a council in
which all nations would be repre-
sented on the basis of economic
strength. The main provisions were
the elimination of internal tariffs
and the establishment of a common
external tariff.

Noell, the last speaker, contended
that there is no reason to believe
that nations on the borderline be-
tween the free and communist
worlds would join the union. He
argued that the plan’s disadvantages
would outweigh its advantages, and
that the present facilities are cap-
able of solving economic problems
in time.

A Christmas Comment

In these sophisticated days, when the tendency is to con-
fuse Santa Claus with Christ, and to substitute, in poet Howard
Nemerov’s words, “‘ a savior of our economy” for the Saviour
of Mankind, the Christmas service held Sunday night by the
UCA was a welcome reminder of what the phrase “Christmas

spirit” should mean.

Dr. Louis Hodges and Calvin Morrow, who were respon-
sible for the movingly effective Candlelight Service, are to be
thanked for reminding us that, regardless of our intellectual
enlightenment, there is still reason for old-fashioned humility

and honest religious inspiration.

We wish to join with Dr. Hodges, Morrow, and the UCA

in expressing our desire that

everyone have a meaningful

and happy Christmas season, and that we all keep in mind
those fundamental ideals for which the Yuletide tradition is

continued.

 

Pace Apologizes for Article;
Lists His “Ten Worst Flicks’

By TOM PACE

It seems appropriate to me that
I begin with an apology. Last week,
in my first column, I wrote five
hundred words that did not appear
in print. Due to a lack of experience
in writing columns for a newspaper,
and I guess, in writing period, I
wrote too much and was necessar-
ily cut. I apologize because it may
have left you with the wrong im-
pression.

“Manchurian” Re-Apprasial

In truth, I did indeed enjoy “The
Manchurian Candidate.” It was in-
teresting, suspenseful, had several
fine performances, and was, on the
whole, entertaining. My criticism of
it was with the screenplay and
Sinatra. The screenplay was ludi-
crous. Excepting this, it was none-
theless interesting. Sinatra was far
below the level that I expect of
him, and I suspect it was his fault.
Yet even with these flaws, I
thought the film was a success; and
I did recommend it to you. Enough
for “Manchuria.”

‘Great Flicks’ Unknown

The Washington Literary Society
held a panel discussion on films
the other night, with Mr. Boat-
wright, Mr. Davis, Mr. Shirey, and
Mr. Taylor as panelists. It was to
me interesting and informative. One
thing plagued me, however. Many
of the films that they referred to,
which are accepted as being great
movies, neither I nor anyone else
there had seen.

The next day I read over a list of
the thirty best films of all time (from
Sight and Sound’s International
Critic’s Poll). Of the thirty, I had
seen three. Why is it that we can’t
see these classics which are sup-
posed to be the great films? If the
Lexington theaters don’t bring them,

 

why isn’t there some society that
doth?
No Interest?

Perhaps the interest isn’t here. Yet
with a club of forty or fifty, one
could easily bring almost any film
on this list, or for that matter, al-
most any film at all that one would
like to see. The motion picture, as
funny as it may seem, is becoming
a medium of true art. Movies, like
novels, have their classics. It’s a
shame that at present we can’t see
them.

Ten Worst Flicks

At the end of each year, critics
throughout the States select their
best ten films lists. In an almost
mocking gesture, the Harvard Lam-
poon selects its ten worst, along
with a worst actor and worst actress.
In their selection, I would hope that
they might not pass over all the
following. Favorites in bold face.

Films: “If a Man Answers” (Bobby
Darin and Sandra Dee)

“Susan Slade” (Troy Donahue and
Connie Stevens)

“No Man Is an Island” (Jeffrey
Hunter)

“Five-Finger Exercise” (Rosalind
Russell and Richard Beymer)

“The 300 Spartans” (Richard Egan)

Actors: George Hamilton, IV
(“Light in the Piazza”), Jeffrey
Hunter, Troy Donahue, Richard
Beymer.

Actresses: Connie Stevens, Sandra
Dee, Rosalind Russell, Dorthy Mc-
Guire (for always being in Troy
Donahue movies).

Going from bad movies to good,
the two best flicks within 150 miles
are here at the Lyric and at the
Rockbridge in B.V.—‘“‘On the Water-
front” and “Lolita,” both are well
worth anybody’s time.

‘Abolish Present System’

Grades: Are They

By BILL LOWRY

One of the strong points of Wash-
ington and Lee has always been its
curriculum. Despite the fact that in
certain crucial areas a major over-
haul is needed, the curriculum as
it stands provides an opportunity
for a sound, basic liberal arts back-
ground, Furthermore, the faculty is,
for the most part, a good one, and
the caliber of work required is ade-
quate, although more challenge is
needed in certain areas.

Progress Being Made

Unfortunately, however, the aca-
demic and intellectual life at Wash-
ington and Lee stops at the class-
room door. Progress has been made
away from this direction. through
the establishment of discussions and
seminars such as those in English
and religion, but there is still a great
dichotomy between the academic and
non-academic spheres.

This prablem, it will be remember-
ed was discussed a great deal last
spring when it became evident that
a number of our better students were
leaving because Washington and Lee
did not provide a desirable intellec-
tual environment.

Emphasis Misplaced

Furthermore, even within the
classroom, the emphasis is not where
it should be: far too many of us
strive only for grades, rather than for
learning for its own sake. Fortu-
nately, the situation here is not as
bad as that at many northern

 

schools, where the competition for
grades is really cutthroat; for this
we can be thankful. Yet, all too many
of us strive only for a “gentleman’s
C” or a “Dean’s List B”; this misdi-
rected emphasis can do nothing but
abuse the learning process.

Bill Kinsey, in an article in last
Friday’s Ring-tum Phi referred to
the fact that several schools have
done away with grades altogether.
For Washington and Lee to under-
take such a venture would indeed
be a radical step; under our present
system, however, things are getting

worse, not better. As admissions
standards become higher, and com-
petition for graduate schools be-
comes keener, more and more em-
phasis is going to be placed on
grades.

Furthermore, the introduction of
the IBM machine to the campus has
removed the “personal touch” so
completely that a professor’s com-
ments on a_ students’ performance
have been reduced to no more than
a mechanical checking of an applic-
able category. For this reason, I
suggest that Washington and Lee
consider seriously the following pro-
posal.

Abolish Grades

Beginning at a set time in the near
future, all grades are to be abolish-
ed;the only notation to be noted on
one’s transcript is “Passed” or “Fail-
ed.”

In place of specific letter grades,

Honor Controversy Continues

 

Students And Teachers Speak Out on Issues

Hodges Clarifies Position
In Honor System Question

Lexington, Virginia
December 17, 1962

Editor
Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
Dear Sir:
I write regarding some _ issues

raised in last week’s interview with
Mr. Harrington on honor and the
Honor System. A number of conver-
sations have led me to think that a
further word or two might prevent
misunderstanding.

First let me congratulate you on
your desire to deal critically with so
deep and valuable a tradition as the
Honor System at Washington and
Lee. If the day ever comes in the
academic community when we re-
fuse to discuss and re-evaluate even
our most cherished traditions we will
have lost the distinctive ingredient
of academic life.

Critical Review of System Vital

A relative newcomer to Wash-
ington and Lee, I have come to
value our Honor System, perhaps as
much as some who have been here
longer than I. This does not mean
that I think the System is perfect
and not subject to critical review.
Indeed, it can live only if critically
reviewed by each new generation
of students. It is in this spirit, then,
that I write.

Turning to a substantive matter or
two, I wish to make three observa-
tions.

1) We need to distinguish carefully
between honor, an abstract virtue,
and the “Honor System,” a concrete
human institution at Washington and
Lee. I intended to direct my remarks
in last week’s interview more to
the subject of honor than to the
Honor System, though I am aware
that to discuss honor is implicitly to
discuss the Honor System.

System Defines Dishonor

Your editorial comment of last
week is well taken that the Honor
System defines what honor is not
rather than what it is. This was pre-
cisely my point, stated in different
words, that ours is much more near-
ly a legal than an honor system. I
do not feel that we should change the
name of the Honor System even
though the title is something of a
misnomer,

My point is simply that honor can-
not be systematized. There must re-
main a kind of healthy tension be-
tween the terms “Honor” and “Sys-
tem.” This is in keeping with your
point that we do not attempt to
codify honor, only dishonor.

Trend Towards Fear System

2) Honor Systems have a tendency
to resolve themselves into “fear”
systems. The “system” of enforce-
ment tends to call more attention to
itself than “honor,” the criterion of
application of the system. When this
shift in emphasis occurs a true hon-
or system is undermined.

I have received the impression

 

from a significant number of stu-
dents that a subtle shift from the
positive motive of honor to the nega-
tive motive of fear is currently
taking place at Washington and
Lee. If these students are correct,
our tradition is now entering a
period of major crisis.

If, moreover, such a shift in em-
phasis is occurring, the only
way to save the Honor System is
to take a fresh look at the nature
of honor with the limits and extent
of the Honor System. It was with
this in mind, incidentally, that I
agreed to the interview with Mr.
Harrington. Our appraisal of the
system must avoid the pressing
temptations to be dewey-eyed and
idealistic, a temptation always pres-
ent when serious ideals are in ques-
tion.

Relativity of Honor

3) The third matter on my mind
is that of the absoluteness or rela-
tivity of honor. You are, in my opin-
ion, only partly correct in your edi-
torial claim that “there is nothing
relative about lying, cheating, and
stealing.” These three terms, to be
sure, are subject to clear definition.
On the other hand, I am confident
that definitions of these terms dif-
fer among our students and faculty.
E.g., some would and some would
not include in the definition the
intent to steal.

Limitation Essential

Of greater importance than rela-
tivity, however, is the matter of the
limitation of the Honor System. We
do in fact, and I think we must,
limit the application of the System.
Some cases, especially of lying and
stealing, are not enforceable and
perhaps are not worthy of enforce-
ment. This is apparently the assump-
tion of many who do not want to
include lying at the ABC store un-
der the system.

Other cases of stealing are not re-
garded as honor offences—e.g., the
removal of silverware from local
eating places during fraternity par-
ties. This relativity in one meaning-
ful sense of that word. It seems to
me that we are obliged to acknowl-
edge these facts.

I hope that this letter will help to
clarify my position on honor. I
would regard it as an irreplaceable
loss to faculty and students alike if
our Honor System were to be lost
through the loss of respect on the
part of either students or faculty.

Sincerely,
LOUIS W. HODGES

Herman, Voice of Protest:
Onward, Christian Soldier!

Dear Dr. Hodges:

The article recently published
concerning your views on the Hon-
or System came as quite a pleasant
surprise to many of us who have
long felt as you do: that “honor” is
a relative and should be treated as
such.

Our problem lies, however, in con-

 

vincing the esteemed men of our
Executive Committee of the merits
of this belief, for it is they and only
they who can amend the present
system.

How, for instance, can one show
these men that they are the chosen
judge, jury and executioner of every
student in the University, and there-
fore should have the power to
weigh the evidence, arrive at a ver-
dict, and present a punishment suit-
able to the crime? Their insistance
that the present system is just and
morally right simply can not be
fought with rational arguments since
obviously opposing moral values are
involved.

Thus we are left with one choice,
and that cannot be made until next
May when the Student Body again
holds its annual elections.

In closing, I would like personally
to thank you for saying what should
have been said many years ago and
to let you know that you are not
fighting the battle alone.

Sincerely,

DICK HERMAN

Letter Writer Criticizes
‘Wishy-Washy’ Editorials

Dear Editor:

Regarding the editorials appear-
ing in the Friday edition of the
Ring-tum Phi, I would like to con-
gratulate the paper for so skillfully
managing to retain its position in the
middle of the road. A professional
politician could not do better!

The annual crusade of the student
body seems, this year, to place most
of its emphasis upon the issues of
the exam schedules and cut system
revision. It is somewhat sad in a
school which places so much stress
upon student government and self-
rule (supposedly incurring a sense
of mature responsibility of action)
that the only permanent and official
voice of the students—the school
newspaper—continues to express
nothing more than a weak stand
(if it can be called a stand) on any
problem of a controversial nature.
What is wrong? Could it be that
the great tradition of self-govern-
ment is a failure? Or how much do
we really govern ourselves?

W&L: Self-Government?

These questions concerning the
success of W&L’s “self-government”
system are so old that I am almost
embarrassed to repeat them. I was,
nevertheless, always under the im-
pression that the prime function of
this unique (?) Washington and Lee
method was to better acquaint the
student with the necessity of choice
and responsible decision.

Once a man makes a decision, he
can never expect it to be effective
unless he is willing to put some
action behind it. Evidently the
Ring-tum Phi is behind some sort
of change in the present arrange-
ment of exams and cuts, but from
reading the editorials, I wonder if

A Hindrance To Academic

dents and professors are to take |
place at the end of the each semes- |

ter, and, perhaps, at the mid-se-
mester period as well; the reports
to parents will consist of the above
notation plus a personal comment
as to the student’s progress.

Comprehensive Exams
Then, in an effort to measure how
a student is really progressing, a
series of comprehensive examina-
tions will be given at the end of the
sophomore and senior years. So-
called “required” courses will be
done away with, but the compre-
hensive will cover a specific range
of subjects, which subjects are to
be given to the students at the be-

ginning of the freshman year.

This will enable the individual
who is good in English or history,
for example, to skip these courses in
favor of more advanced ones, thus
making it possible for each student
to work on his own weak points,
freeing him from material he has al-
ready covered.

Need Would Be Met

The subjects to be covered on the
comprehensives will be equivalent
to the present distribution require-
ments; in this way, the needs of
a basic liberal arts education will be
met, at the same time providing for
individual progress and _ initiative
The comprehensives themselves will
be graded only with “Passed” or
“Failed,” and a student who fails
will be allowed to take the examina-

 

tion over again at the beginning of
the next term.

Extensive Report on Each Student

At the end of the student’s career,
an extensive report will be written
for each student, covering the
amount of work covered, the quality
of work in each subject, and will
answer such questions as, “Has this
student lived up to his expected po-
potential?” This report will serve as
a student’s transcript, and together
with Graduate Record Examination
scores, will be the basis of his appli-
cation to graduate school.

‘A Radical Proposal’

Such a proposal sounds quite radi-
cal, and indeed it is. Furthermore, it
would place a great burden on both
the individual students and_ the
members of the faculty, calling for
a much more mature attude on the
part of both. And yet, look at the
advantages. The pressure which in-

 

evitably follows a rigid grading sys-
tem will be virtually done away
with.

In Order To Learn
Students will study in order to learn,
not to make a certain grade, and
progress will be judged according
to each individual’s progress rather
than according to an _ arbitrary
standard. Students (and professors)
could be freed from the burden of
countless hour quizzes merely for
the sake of determining a grade
point average, and education would
become a truly creative venture.
And, perhaps, most important, the

 

requirements of a good liberal arts |

education would be met without the
drags of innumerable required
courses, distribution points, etc.; and
such a program would further rec-
ognize that all learning need not
take place in the classroom.
Presupposes Responsibility
Such a proposal assumes, of
course,, the existence of a responsi-
ble student body and faculty who
recognize the burden such would
place on them; it also assumes that
a person who comes to college for
education, not a four-year party be-
fore entering the army or taking
over the family business.
Furthermore, today the mere reply
“But that would mean changing the
catalogue” is often enough to stifle
any proposed reform in the academic
life; if such an attitude is the pre-
vailing one, a proposal like the above
will get no further than this paper.
However, times are changing, and
Washington and Lee is changing;
every freshman class is more capable
of such discipline than the previous
one, If the college is to meet its re-
sponsibility in such a _ changing
world, it too must change, although
not without giving careful consider-
ation to each proposed change.

Piecemeal Changes
At present, any change in the
basic academic structure of Wash-
ington and Lee has been on a piece-
meal basis, with each department
revising its own curriculum when
it feels the need, and with little or

 

 

the paper really believes in the de-
cisions it makes.

Editorials Trite, Ineffective

Each of the editorials concerning
cuts and exams were remarkably
similar. The problem was _ stated
fairly (this is merely news), but
when it came to the expression of
an opinion of some nature, each did
nothing more than to fill the column.
They abounded with such trite inef-
fective phrases as “we hope,” “it
seems,” or “while”’—while we may
not succeed in this accomplishment,
something elce might come up.

The editorial on exam scheduel-
ing admits that the faculty resolu-
tion “has no conerete meaning,”
but then goes no further than to say
that such slight faculty action as
was taken is “heartening” and that
we can have “hope.”

Concedes the Battle

In a like manner, the editorial on
cuts concedes the battle before it
has even really been undertaken. It
states that, “chances of having un-
limited cuts for everyone with a
one point average are remote.” Cer-
tainly the chances are remote if we
aren't going to put something be-
hind them! Moreover, the fact re-
mains that the paper offered no
strong and sensible alternative, but
only expressed a watered down
“hope” for change—perhaps “a so-
cial penalty”—sometime in that all
too vague “near future.”

The ‘Hope’ Is Obvious

When 80 per cent of the student
body bothers to sign a petition (one
that advocates more than just a
simple change), it is obvious that
“hope” already exists. What is need-
ed now is some sort of positive spirit
to spark and kindle further hope. It
rests in individuals such as John
Kirkley but not in the Ring-tum
Phi.

The fact remains that the paper is
lacking either in the courage or
the ability to take a strong stand
on what it feels should be done. It
gives us only an indication of what
will be done (namely nothing) as
long as it is afraid to put some
strong action behind its decisions in
order to test their worth.

GARRETT KRATZIG

Lowry’s Integration Plan
Called South’s Only Hope

To the Editor:

Last week a fellow student pub-
lished an article in the Ring-tum
Phi entitled “Integration: Are We
Shirking Our Duty?” Many of us
read it, but some did not. There
was a notable tendency for some
students to disregard the article
simply because of the word “inte-
gration” in its title. Is it ever wise
for us to disregard an opinion on
a problem which concerns us, and
especially this one, merely because it
might be opposed to our own line

(Continued on page 4)

Pursuits?

no regard for the overall picture.
Thus, basic errors in the structure
are preserved, and many inconsisten-
cies are added, as is seen for ex-
ample, in the fact that some depart-
ments require comprehensive ex-
aminations for graduation and others
do not.
Complete Revision

For this reason, I suggest a com-
mittee be appointed to study such
proposals as the above, with the
intention of a complete revision of
the present system. Such a commit-
tee should consist of student lead-
ers, faculty and administrative of-
ficials, and, perhaps, even one or
two thoughtful alumni. Such a com-
mittee would study the program at
other liberal arts colleges, perhaps
meeting with their officials, and re-
turn a detailed report on how to re-
vitalize the academie framework at
Washington and Lee.

It must, of course, be remembered
that Washington and Lee is Wash-
ington and Lee, and not Reed, An-
tioch, Swarthmore, or any other col-
lege. And yet, this should not deter
us from trying to meet our role to
the best of our ability. We can learn
from others as others can learn from
us. All that needs to be done is to
make the effort.

Our work in establishing the
newly-formed College Athletic Con-
ference has been righly praised, and
indeed it should be.

If we can play such an important
role in the area of athletics, why not
in the academic sphere as well?

11.0 points as a freshman, converted
four of seven shots from the floor
and eight of ten free throws.

The Generals, paced by the long-
range bombing of guard Brett
Thackston, moved into a 33-32 half-
time lead over the shabby-looking
Colonels.

A Second Half Surge

After intermission, W&L stormed
back on the strong right arm of
Paterno. The little Charleston, W.
Va. Guard made six straight points
and nine of the Generals’ first 11
points in the second half to vault
W&L into a 44-36 lead.

Three more points by Paterno, a
field goal by Rodger Fauber and
three points by freshman center Bob
Spessard gave the Generals their
biggest lead of the night, 52-42.

Centre Rallies

Centre, led by Hal Smith and Dan-
ny Marks, broke out of its field goal
famine and whittled the margin to
42-51 before Wallis hit three straight
goals.

Inept Generals

Making its worst offensive show-
ing in four years, Washington and
Lee’s Basketball team fell to Catho-
lic University, 65-41, Monday night
at Catholic.

Not since W&L managed only 25
points in losing to Virginia Tech,
105-25, in 1958-59, has a General
team failed to pass the 45-point
mark in scoring.

This made only the fifth time in
12 years that a W&L team has not
tallied at least 35 points in a game.

Fauber Scores 12

Rodger Fauber was the only Gen-
eral who broke into double figures,
scoring 12.

Catholic jumped into a command-
ing 35-13 lead as W&L played one
of its poorest halves in years.

The Generals bounced back in the
second half, scoring 28 points to
Catholic’s 30.

The loss lowered the Generals’
record to 1-6. Catholic is now 3-4,

scored a 4-2 triumph.

Winfield also captured two match-

Henry Starnes of Auburn in over-

BY 0. E. SCHOEFFLER, eEsauire’s Fashion Director

Many a young man adds accessories to his wardrobe by letting rela-
tives—a maiden aunt who “can’t resist cute novelties’—pick out
his belts, hose and sleepwear at birthdays and Christmastime. The
results are, naturally enough, often cute—and always disastrous.
Elegance in dress extends beyond a man’s exterior, and shows in
his knowledgeable attention to detail. Accessories are an integral
part of every wardrobe, and the truly well-stocked wardrobe doesn’t
end with what can be seen at first glance.

PULL UP YOUR PANTS! aithough most

of today’s slacks are styled with expan-
sion waistbands and side-tab adjustments,
many men still add a touch of color to
their slacks with a belt. A ribbon striped
fabric belt, with leather ends and a small
brass buckle, lends color contrast to solid
color slacks. Double and triple vertical
stripes, in 2 or 8 colors, are the dominant
trend, with some belts seen in all-over
multicolor stripes.

For sportswear coordination with patterned shirts or jackets, try
a fabric belt in a tweedy, rough-textured finish, in charcoal brown
or black-olive. With your suits, the calfskin belt in dark brown,
black or olive remains de rigeur.

THE FINAL FLOURISH +++ With any tailored apparel is the breast

pocket handkerchief, worn in a loose square fold or soft puff style.
Some matching neckwear and handkerchief sets are available, but
most muted paisleys and madder prints stand on their own in colors
to coordinate with your suit. And for your after-dark wear, a
splash of solid color silk is a solid compliment to your taste.

TRADITIONAL ARGYLES + »+remain the favorite pattern in socks,

and young men in particular like these colorful ankle lengths. Solids
with argyle side panels are slightly more dressy. For wear with
your tailored apparel, solid color wool and wool blends are a best
bet, especially in heathertone blends with a wide rib effect. For
really leisure leisurewear, the athletic ribbed white sock, banded on
top with colorful stripes, remains the campus favorite.

‘ IF YOU WANT TO PLAY TARZAN...

that’s your business. But pajamas really
are more comfortable than your under-
wear for sleeping. The traditional men’s
pajama is usually of solid color or white
broadcloth, with a pullover or jacket-type
top. Bright and bold colors can be seen
this year. A more recent development on
the sleepwear fashion scene is the sports-
wear-inspired pajama, with a cross-stripe
knit top contrasted with solid color broad-
cloth trousers that are styled like slacks
with an expansion waistband and side

ise elastic.
4% ROBE, PIPE AND SLIPPERS . . . is the

traditional trio for solid late evening com-
fort. To the college man, or any man away
from home, his robe assumes an impor-
tant role in his wardrobe. The classic robe
is of solid color wool flannel, and can
usually be seen in blue, tan, gray, maroon
and black. Also in wool, or blends of wool
and cotton, you may like the bright
splashes of color in wrap-around belted
plaids and tartans. Either style assures
you solid, and fashionable comfort.

THE PATTER OF LITTLE FEET »»+may make a warm and homey

cliche, but the idea is pretty uncomfortable when they’re your bare
little feet padding around the cold dormitory floor. Slippers in
comfortable mocassin design, of soft brown or black leather with
a pile fabric lining, can keep you warm through the winter. If you
prefer a dressier slipper, there is the traditional soft, plain toe
slipper of unlined leather with a cushion sole. A newer idea is the
boot-type high-riser slipper, also of leather, and usually black with
a warm pile lining. And don’t forget a pair of shower-clog rubber
sandals for those jogs to the shower and back,

THE HOLIDAY SEASON » +» is the peak season for proms, balls,

cotillions, dances, blasts, and just plain parties. If you’re thinking
about your formalwear—and you should be—watch for next month’s

of thought? And should we be op-
posed to the suggestion put forth
by Bill Lowry?

Two Southern Problems

As this writer sees it, we of the
South are faced with two general
problems—our relative poverty and
our racial frictions. But are these
two in actuality not one, and do
they not feed upon each other?

In supporting a dual school sys-
tem we place upon ourselves the
burden of providing at much great-
er expense the same education as
those who support a single school
system. Now this would be fine, if
we had a great deal more to spend
on education than they. But of
course we do not.

Inferior Education

Yet each year we give our school
children a comparatively inferior
education and expect them and our
Southland to compete with the rest

of the country. But from inferior |

education comes an inferior com-

| of two systems, but we could at the

|same time learn to live with equal

dignity as men. Thus we could solve
two problems at once .

| Process Will Be Thorny

The process of integrating south-
ern school systems is and will not
be any bed of roses. It is not im-
portant here to attempt to list the
problems which accompany this pro-
cess, but whatever they may be, they
can be lessened if we accept their
existence and try to intelligently
solve them. We have hidden from
our problems long enough.

Where Are Our Leaders?

It seems that too often today the
people trying to bring about some
sort of solution to racial conflicts
are of the other race. Where are the
leaders of our own? It has long been
accepted that Washington and Lee
University is a leader in the South
in education and in providing the
South with leaders. We now have an
opportunity to provide leadership
once again by facing the problems

 

munity. Without equal tools we can-| ards in solving them. We have a
not make an equal income, and with| duty to society, but only with a little
smaller incomes, we have less tax | social courage can we accept it; and,
revenue to devote to our
system. The process operates in a| advancement discover that inte-

Cantre broke back ahead, 76-75,
but a free throw by Paterno with
2:15 remaining knotted the score for
the last time at 76-76.

In the next minute and a half with

downward spiral, and we take our-
selves deeper into the problem each
year. We may raise the level of
southern education with technologi-
cal advances and other devices, but
we will never be able to efficiently
compete in this field until the real
problems are tackled.

Should the South have the cour-
age to challenge tradition and to
reconcile her racial differences, she
might find great profit by it in the
long run. With the implementation
of integration in our public school
system, we in the South could find
a good start in helping ourselves.

teachers for our schools with savings

W&L Contributes 30% Of County Christmas Charity

Some 300 needy Rockbridge County families had a happier Christmas
this year partly because of the contributions of Washington and Lee stu-
dents through the Interfraternity Council. Of the annual Rockbridge
Christmas Basket Program that furnishes $2,000 of food and toys to
indigent area families, students gave $600 this year. The University
Christian Association’s Candlelight Service offering also was given to the
program.

This year was the first time the IFC voted to let each of the fraternities
decide its own contribution to the program—in past years each house had
given a fixed amount. In some cases the amounts given this year tripled the
fixed amounts of past Christmases. VMI also contributes to the program.

prer Digest

Presents Award

The Washington and Lee depart-
ment of journalism and communica-
tions has received a $1,000 grant
from the Reader’s Digest.

The gift will provide traveling and
living expenses for journalism stu-
dents working on out-of-town re-
search and reporting projects, ac-
cording to Prof. O. W. Riegel, head
of the department. Reader’s Digest
awards a limited number of these
grants ranging from $500 to $1,000
annually to selected schools and de-
partments of journalism for the pur-
pose of broadening the scope of stu-
dent training.

“We welcome the fund as a means
for furthering research by students
on public issues,” Prof. Riegel said.
“While our setting has many advan-
tages, close proximity to sources of
national and international news is
not one of them. The fund will help
to remedy this disadvantage.”

Students qualifying for aid from
the new fund will be given specific
assignments in news centers, in-
cluding Richmond, Washington and
New York. They will report in depth
on subjects assigned, in the form of

Novelist

Speaks Here Friday

Reynolds Price To Lecture In duPont

The Washington and Lee

Seminars in Literature program

will present young North Carolina novelist Reynolds Price
Friday night in duPont Auditorium. Price will speak on ‘‘Neces-
sary Acts’’ of his first novel, A Long and Happy Life, which

received enthusiastic praise upon its publication last year.

The talk, which markes the

ROTC Corps

 

To Reorgantize

Lt. Colonel Jack P. Burch, new
Professor of Military
W&L, has announced a reorganiza-

tion plan for the Corps of Cadets
to go into effect during the second

semester.

Under the new command struc-

ture, a brigade consisting of two

troop battalions will be created to
replace the current one battalion

set-up. Although new headquarters

elements will be introduced, the
cadets will continue to be organized
into four troop companies and a
Band Company as in the past.
Opportunities for Promotion
The purpose of the reorganization,

- aecording to Col. Burch, is to provide

opportunities for a number of mid-
year cadet promotions. The new
battalion headquarters and the bri-
gade headquarters will be staffed by
cadet officers selected on the basis
of merit and overall demonstrated
performance. Among the higher
ranking cadet officers will be one

full Colonel, three Lt. Colonels, and
four Majors. The brigade structure |

will allow more cadets the chance
to practice leadership in the exer-

cise of new command responsibilities
| than previously. |
“It is anticipated that this same

technique of using a single four-
company battalion the first semester
followed by a two-battalion brigade
in the second semester will be used
in subsequent school years,” Col.
Burch said.

titled “The Violinist,” created by

Ernest Pintoff and featuring the

‘voices” of Carl Reiner.

The second film is “Le Colonel
Chabert,” adapted from Honore de
Balzac. The film will run one hour
and forty minutes and features the
late Raimu in a performance as

| Colonel Chabert.

The film is the story of a soldier
(Chabert), who was officially listed
as a casualty of the battle of Eylau

in 1807. He returns to France after

a long period of amnesia to reclaim
a name, a fortune, and a wife which
are no longer his.

On January 18 two other French
films are scheduled to be shown.
They are “Le Chevre de M. Seguin”
and “Paris 1900,” a pre-World War
I documentary. They will also be
shown in duPont Auditorium.

Two other foreign films are ten-
tatively scheduled for March, “Zero

*Seminars in Literature series, will
begin at 8:15 p.m. and is open to the
public.

Price, who has also written a
number of short stories, has had
stories published in two O. Henry
Prize Award volumes and in the
English monthly magazine Encount-
er, among others.

He was recently awarded the Sir
Walter Raleigh prize in North Car-
olina for his work.

A Long and Happy Life was pub-
lished last spring by Athenaum, the
publication coinciding with the
novel’s appearance in Harper’s Mag-
azine. It was the first time that
Harper’s had ever printed an entire
novel in a single issue.

Book Award Nominee

The novel has been nominated for
the 1962 National Book Award. It’s
praise has been effusive and close to
unanimous. Leaders in literary cir-
cles including Stephen Spender, Lord
David Cecil, and Eudora Welty have
“singled it out for special comment
and commendation.”

Spender said: “I think this is the
most remarkable novel by a young
writer which I have read for many
years. It is a most moving and dis-
turbing love story, told with com-
pelling observation, sharp and orig-
inal humor, and deep feeling.”

Price has been generally accorded
a place among the several brilliant
young writers in the United States
today. Others in this generation in-
clude Philip Roth and John Updike.

The novel is set in Warren County,
North Carolina, and concerns a
young woman whose intense love for
a man who doesn’t seem to return
her love causes her both joy and
sorrow.

May Be Filmed

Price is now working on a collec-
tion of short stories and a new novel.
The New York Times reported some
months ago that there are plans for
making A Long and Happy Life into
a movie.

Later this year Price will be
reading at the Young Men’s Hebrew
Association in New York. The
YMHA has recently drawn Kather-
ine Anne Porter and James Baldwin
as readers.

Price was born in 1933 and gradu-
ated from Duke University in 1955.
For the next three years he studied
at Oxford University as a Rhodes
Scholar, receiving his Bachelor of
Letters degeree from Oxford in
1958. He returned to teach at Duke;
spent the session of 1961-62 in
England, and is now a member of
the English faculty at Duke.

Second Seminar of Year

 

Price’s appearance is the second
this semester under the Seminars
in Literature program. Shortly be-

fore Christmas the program featured
the leading critic Northrup Frye,
who spoke on “The Structure of
Imagery in Modern Poetry.” Frye’s
talk was given in the same week
as the Glasgow Series of appear-
ances of three American poets.

Last year the English writer Colin
| Wilson spoke under the auspices of
| the Seminars program.

 

Exhibit Features Orientals

Prints by contemporary Oriental
artists living and working in the
Western world will be on display in
Washington and Lee University’s
duPont Art Gallery during January,

The exhibition—titled “The East
in the West’—includes some 40
prints on loan from the Ferdinand
Roten Galleries in Baltimore, Md.
The show is sponsored by the uni-
versity’s department of fine arts.

Colored etchings, lithographs and
wood blocks are included in
month-long exhibit, according to Dr.
Marion Junkin, head of the Wash-
ington and Lee fine arts department.
The prints will be for sale during
the exhibition.

Post World War Hl
The exhibit, the fifth in the duPont

the |

gallery since September, offers a
look at the work of a number of
successful Oriental artists of the

post-World War II era.
Sugai, Zao-Wou-Ki, Hamaguchi,
Uchima, Moti and Kobashi are
among those being displayed.

The November duPont exhibition
featured traditional prints by Japa-
nese artists. The current print show
is modern and designed to contrast
i the two Oriental styles.

January also marks the final month

Everbody—at Washington and Lee, anyway—knows what's |

meant when they hear the term ‘Minks.’ That’s what the
Veemies call the students, and what they’ve been calling them
for some time.

And everyone knows, too, what Keydets, Wahoo, Ring-
tum Phi, etc. suggest. The Keydets are the Cadets, the Wahoos
are the UVa. students, and the Ring-tum Phi—well, that’s us.

But where did these words come from? It’s easy to see
keydet-cadet derivation, but the origins of the others are (to us)
lost in obscurity.

And that’s the point of this editorial. We are interested
in finding out just how these words came into common usage.
If any of our readers know the origin of these or other oft-
repeated words that have interesting stories behind them,
let us know. We're sure there are readers in the dark who are
just as curious as we, and we would like to fill them in.

 

A Dance Suggestion

Beginning next year, the presidents of the sophomore,
junior and senior classes will serve as presidents of Openings,
Springs and Finals dance weekends as well.

We feel that this Dance Set innovation will be a decided im-
provment over the old system of electing fraternity and party-
supported individuals to head up big weekends.

However, we would like to mention an additional change
that has been suggested to us.

In the past, it has oftentimes been a real strain financially
on the house with the dance set president. Men in such houses

have sometimes been assessed as much as $50 per person for
the weekend cocktail party, traditionally held by the president’s
fraternity.

Instead of being financed by a single house, the cocktail
parties could be paid for by an entire class—thus easing the
burden on both individuals and fraternities.

We sincerely hope that this idea will at least be considered
when the new system of class presidents as dance set presi-
dents is instituted. It seems logical that since a class is sponsor-

Letters to the Editor

 

Honor System Labeled ‘Punitive’

there is the aspect of the absolute in
the rendering of judgment upon an
individual, and whenever any human |
society takes such irrevocable au- |
thority unto itself, it behooves that |
society and those individuals who
render the judgment to be both|
humble and circumspect in the ex-
treme.

(Editor’s note: Although
the Honor System at Washing-
ton and Lee has always been
regarded as particularly a stu-
dent province, the Ring-tum
Phi is glad to have a member
of the faculty express his own
personal views on this or any
other subject.)

To the Editor:

In your editorial of December 11
the statement was made that “the
honor system is not a disciplinary
or legal system.” Ideally speaking
the statement is true. Ideally it is
to be hoped that the individuals
attracted to this school will be the
sort of persons in whom a sense of
the honorable in human conduct in-
heres—each and every one of whom
cherishes truth to the highest self
above all other considerations in
life, not just in the prescribed areas
of lying, cheating and stealing (all of
which are variations on “giving the
lie” to facticity, out of which arises
all sin), but in every human action
and relationship, secret or public, ;
whether here or away, or in the)
silent reflections of the inmost heart. |

notion that his exclusion be for the |

as if his presence has overnight be-

morality of his quondam fellows. |
None of us is so morally aseptic or

Offender Needs Protection |

At this point it seems to me that
the censured individual, who is in
very fact under absolute indictment,
is the one who needs protection, and

condemned him. We may well have
the right to decide that, for what-
ever reason, such-and-such an in-
dividual does not belong within this
body. We may codify our rules as
we wish and demand that they be
respected. But if we live and define
our morality under God, as we claim
to do, from where do we pre-empt
the warrant to sit in irrevocable
judgment on any man in such a way
as to anathematize him for life?

To me it is deeply regrettable that
the option of voluntary withdrawal
from the student body was sus-
pended. The difference may seem

Brian Kelley

Canadian Student Prefers
American Political System

By JIM DeYOUNG

The curious student is always anx-
ious to have a chance to associate
with a student from another coun-
try.

Brian Kelley, a first year law stu-
dent at Washington and Lee, from
Winnipeg, Canada, graduated from
the University of Manitoba and has
been a resident of this country since
last September.

But the most fascinating and in-
teresting fact about Brian is that
he is foregoing his Canadian citizen-
ship to become an American citizen.

Brian has been planning to become
an American since college, and he
eventually intends to practice law
somewhere in the United States.

Since he will graduate from law
school in two years, he will prob-
ably work for our government for
a couple of years until his five-year
residency requirement for citizen-
ship is completed.

Canada ‘Too Leftist’

Why has this young Canadian de-
cided to become an American citi-
zen?

Brian has very strong feelings
about the political situation in Cana-
da at the present. He is not pleased
with the government, which is po-
litically to the left. “The Canadian
government shirks its political re-
sponsibility,” he said.

He mentioned an active Socialist
party there and said that the lib-
erals and conservatives are anti-

| American in their platform and poli-

to know. Mr. Douglas is excellent. |
He plays his role with sincerity | people.
and integrity, and a certain bril-|

liance which makes one forget the|

his story with restraint, and built |

style to a screen which has long|

 

 

cies in order to please the Canadian

“There is hestiancy on their part
to back issues that should be back-
ed—the O.A.S., for instance—be-
cause the government feels that if
they did join this organization, they
would simply become a_ rubber
stamp for the United States.” he said.

Export Economy Unfavorable

He also cited the export economy
of Canada as unfavorable at this

 

time. Canada trades wheat with
Communist China, their biggest
wheat buyer, and also with Cuba in
non-strategic items, he added.

He thinks the Canadian govern-
ment is showing a soft approach to
Communism, and predicts that Prime
Minister Diefenbaker will be ousted
in the spring elections, and that
Lester Pearson and his liberals will
come to power.

Because Pearson is pro-American
and one of the founders of N.A.T.O.,
Brian hopes that some of the anti-
American and anti-British feeling
will eventually disappear. He feels
that this would help to improve the
overall climate of the entire country.

Majored in U.S. Polities

Brian exhibits a deep admiration
for the United States. His under-
graduate degree at the University
of Manitoba was in the American
side of political science and his
secondary major was in American
history. Out of this study came a
deep interest in the U.S., and one
of the reasons he came to Virginia
is because of its rich historical value.
He is very impressed with the South,
“its white-pillared mansions and
‘you all’ expressions” he has seen in
movies about the South.

Brian believes our government
knows what it is up against and that
it is willing to fight for what it
thinks is right. In Canada “they are
willing to compromise too much,” he
said.

This Area ‘Too Right Wing’

His only criticism of this part of
the country is that he feels that
there tends to be too strong a right
wing feeling here. He also thinks
there is too much strict adherence to
conservative policies in the South.

Brian feels strongly that “our peo-
ple are united in a_semi-cause
against communism,” and he admires
our Constitution and wants to live
under it. He feels he will do better
in this country, and that the United

Generals By
PMC, 76-68

Santa Claus paid Washington and
Lee’s basketball team a_ surprise
early visit December 18 and helped
the Generals to a 76-68 upset vic-
tory over Pennsylvania Military Col-
lege.

The Generals, who were held to
their lowest point total in five years
the night before by Catholic U. (a
65-41 loss), broke out of a five-
game losing string to post their sec-
ond win of the year.

Fauber Stars

Captain Rodger Fauber, guard
Brett Thackston, and center Howard
Martin starred in the W&L triumph.

Fauber poured in 26 points and |

collected 22 rebounds. Thackston
tallied 18 points, and Martin scored
14 points and grabbed a career-high
26 rebounds.

Martin, Fauber, and Thackston
scored all but four of W&L’s points
in the first half as the Generals
pulled into a 31-32 lead.

Free Throws Difference

In the second half, deadly ac-
curacy at the free throw line salted
away the win.

Fauber sank 11 of 13 charity tosses,
Thackston hit four of four, Martin
added a perfect two for two and
guard Louie Paterno made five of
seven. In all W&L converted 23
of 31 free throws in the half.

With Geno Zveced scoring PMC’s
first 12 points the military school
moved into an early lead. A jumper
by Thackston, however, put the

Unitideated Wrestlers Face
Gallaudet Saturday Night

By ANDY KILPATRICK

Washington and Lee’s top notch
wrestling team seeks its fourth win
of the season Saturday night when
it travels to Gallaudet College.

The Generals have scored three
straight wins by topping North Car-
olina, 19-8, Old Dominion College,
17-11, and Pfeiffer, 26-6.

Best Balanced

Coach Dick Miller tabs this crew
as the “best balanced” team he has
had since he’s been at Washington
and Lee.

Four Wrestlers, Jud Babcock, Pete
Winfield, Tom Stover, and Herb
Smith, have turned in undefeated
seasons thus far. Butch West and
Dave Montgomery both have 2-1

High-Scoring Tiger Club
nvades W&L Tonight

Washington and Lee’s battle-scar-
red Generals return to cage war-
fare tonight against Hampden-Syd-
ney’s high flying Tigers.

The Tigers, who boast the nation’s
second best offense for
leges at 94.0 points per game, bring
a 7-3 record into the contest. W&L
is 2-6.

H-S Upset

Hampden-Sydney was upset by
Old Dominion College, 86-84, Sat-
urday night, therefore, the Tigers
may take their anger out on the
Generals.

Forward Tom Supak, who missed
seven of the eight games before
Christmas, is expected to see some
action tonight.

Big worry for Coach Bobby Mc-
Henry’s Generals is H.S. captain and
forward Bill Hardin. Hardin is ninth
in the nation in scoring average,
27.9, and fourth in free throw per-
centage.

Hampden-Sydney continued their
upward swing towards an outstand-
ing season with two tournament
championships—Fort Lee Invitation-
al and the North-South Holiday
Fiesta.

Tiger team effort saw them set a
new record at Fort Lee in total
points scored in three games with
258, breaking the record by three.

The Tigers also tied the most
field goals scored with 105, matching
Fort Lee’s output of last year. The
Tigers were the first civilian team
to win the tourney in its three-year
history. In doing so they defeated

All-Tournament team _ selections
consisted of three Tigers—Bill Har-
din who scored 56 points and grab-
bed 39 rebounds in two nights, Dave
Trickler, and Tom Quarles.

Nationally the Tigers rank sixth
in total offense with a 92.2 average.
Bill Hardin ranks number nine in
scoring with a 27.7 average, which
also makes him the leader in Vir-
ginia colleges. Hardin is also fifth
in free throw percentage with 32-35
and a 914 mark.

Winning streak of nine games
makes the Tigers a formidable foe
for small college teams in the state.
Two of the wins do not count in the
official season standings because they

Loves of Dobie Gillis,” etc.)

 

A GUIDE FOR THE UNMONEYED

R. L. Sigafoos was a keen, ambitious lad, and when he finished
high school he wished mightily to go on with his education. It
seemed, however, a forlorn hope. R. L.’s father could not send
the boy to college because a series of crop failures had brought
him to the brink of disaster. (R. L.’s father raised orchids which,
in North Dakota, is a form of agriculture fraught with risk.)
It was, therefore, squarely up to R. L. He could go to college
only if he worked his way through. This was a prospect that
dismayed him. He had a deep-seated fear that the task would
be too great, that he would never be able to carry on a full, busy
college life and still find time to do odd jobs and make money.
Racked with misgivings, R. L. paced the streets, pondering
his dilemma. One day, walking and brooding, he came upon a
park bench and sat down and lit a Marlboro cigarette. R. L.
always lit a Marlboro when he was low in his mind. R. L. also
always lit a Marlboro when he was merry. The fact is there is
no occasion—happy or sad, pensive or exuberant, cheery or
solemn—when Marlboro with its fine filter and fine flavor is
not entirely welcome, as you will discover when you go to your
favorite tobacconist and buy some, as we—the makers of
Marlboro and IJ and R. L. Sigafoos—hope you will do real soon.
Sitting and thinking and smoking a Marlboro on the park
bench, R. L. was suddenly interrupted by a small, quavering
voice which said, “My boy, you are troubled. Can I help?”

   

gti

Aten

Seated beside R. L. was a tiny, gnarled man with wispy,
snow-white hair. His skin was almost transparent, showing a
delicate tracery of fragile bones beneath. His back was bent,
and his hands trembled. But his eyes were bright and clear.
R. L. looked into those eyes, into the wrinkled face. He saw
wisdom there, and experience, and kindness. “Do you think,
sir,” said R. L., “that a boy can work his way through college
and still enjoy a rich, full campus life?”

“Why, bless you, son,” replied the stranger with a rheumy
chuckle, “of course you can. In fact, I did it myself.”

“Was it very hard?” asked R. L.

“Yes, it was hard,” the stranger admitted. “But when one
is young, all things are possible. I, for example, used to get up
at five o’clock every morning to stoke the furnace at the SAE
house. At six I had to milk the ewes at the school of animal
husbandry. At seven I gave a fencing lesson to the Dean of
Women. At eight I had a class in early Runic poets. At nine I
gave haircuts at the Gamma Phi Beta house. At ten I had dif-
ferential calculus. At eleven I posed for a life class. At twelve
I watered soup at the Union. At one I had a class in Oriental
languages. At two I exercised the mice in psych lab. At three
I gave the Dean of Women another fencing lesson. At four |
had qualitative analysis. At five I went clamming. At six I cut
meat for the football team. At seven I ushed at the movies, At
eight I had my ears pierced so that at nine I could tell fortunes
in a gypsy tearoom. At ten I had a class in astronomy. At
eleven I tucked in the football team. At twelve I studied and
at three I went to sleep.”

“Sir,” cried R. L., “I am moved and inspired by your shin-
ing example!”

“It was nothing,” said the stranger modestly, shaking his
frail white head. “It was just hard work, and hard work never
hurt anybody.”

“Would you mind telling me, sir,” said R. L., “how old you
are now?”
“Twenty-two,” said the stranger. @ 1963 Max Shulmas

Success... But Not Always
And his few failings in character-
ization lead to another weakness.
Mr. Price has to make his ordinary

people and events interesting. For
the most part he succeeds, but not
always. Once in awhile, his passages

seem a little boring.
On First Reading
On first reading I had thought
that he was much less successful in
the first third than in the other
two. For it is in the last two that
he gives us Rosacoke’s problem and

how she resolves it, and it is here
| that his writing is moving and more
poignant and here where he brings

me into his character. Also he be-
comes concerned with setting a
definite mood and he does this very
well.
On Second Reading

On second reading, however, I
found the whole to be enjoyable.
Mr. Price is a moving, compelling,
and interesting new writer with a
new style and he promises to be
one for a long time. He has written
an excellent novel.

Ex-Gov. Will Deliver
Tucker Law Lectures

Colgate W. Darden To Speak Here May 4-5

Former Virginia Governor Colgate W. Darden, Jr., will
deliver the 15th annual John Randolph Tucker Lectures in the
School of Law at Washington and Lee University on May 3
and 4.

The one time Virginia chief executive, who has practiced

 

   
  
  

shelters. |
A crew of four men from the|

Norfolk district, Army Corps of

Engineers, under the direction of

Richard Barlow, arrived in town last
week to begin the shelter marking |
program.

The largest concentration of |
marked shelters is on the VMI post.
The shelter areas had been surveyed |
earlier. |

Washington and Lee officials de- |
clined to have the shelter areas in|
W&L buildings marked at this time, |

Mr. Barlow said.
Regarding Washington and Lee’s |
position in the matter President

Fred C. Cole made the following |
statement:

“Washington and Lee has not de-|
clined to make its facilities available
for fallout shelters.

“We have made a complete re- |
view of our facilities at Washing-
ton and Lee and have conducted
a much more comprehensive study
than was made under the auspices
of the Civil Defense. It is our full
intention to make available all
space that is appropriate for fall-
out shelters. Representatives of
the Army Corps of Engineers
came late Monday, without having
communicated with us in = any
way, and told us of areas that had
been designed as appropriate for
fallout shelters.

“The decision was reached con-
cerning fallout shelters without any
reference to the work and study we
have done over a considerable period
of time. We informed tthe represen-
tatives of the Corps of Engineers
that we would be pleased to have a
recommendation from them, and
when we are of the opinion that an
adequate review has been made, we
will be more than happy to cooperate
with appropriate government offi-
cials. Certainly we are eager to serve
this community in as efficient and
adequate manner as possible.”

The Army Engineers team mark-
ing buildings in the western part
of the state explained that before
any public shelter is designated,
permission must be obtained from
the property owner.

speech was given by Bob Hart,
senior from W&L. He discussed

the subject of medical care for the

May Change
To Two Years

Proposed sweeping changes in the
college Reserve Officer Training
Corps program, almost certain to
draw strong opposition in the new
Congress, could result in reduction
of the present four-year program
at Washington and Lee to a two-
year program.

As reported by Senate sources in
Washington, the legislation to be
sought by Defense Secretary Rob-
ert S. McNamara would call for:

An end to ROTC programs in
high schools; elimination of the
present compulsory ROTC pro-
grams in all land grant colleges;
and reduction of the four-year
ROTC courses in most colleges and
universities to two years.

Such traditional military colleges
as VMI, Virginia Tech, Texas A&M
and The Citadel would be exempted
from the changes, it is understood.
These schools and others have sup-
plied many of the career officers
for the military service for genera-
tions.

Washington and Lee has an
Army ROTC unit that has been in
operation for about a decade. Be-
tween 50 to 55 students receive
commissions each year. In_ the
335-man ROTC unit, there are 109
contract students.

If the reduction from a four-year
program to a two-year plan is op-
tional, it is expected that W&L
would want to retain its four-year
set-up. If the cutback to two years
is mandatory, the program offered
at W&L would probably be pattern-
ed closely after the present schedule
for juniors and seniors.

W&L ROTC department head, Lt.
Col. Jack Burch declined to com-
ment on the matter.

By faculty action the Saturday
schedule of classes (missed on
Lee's Birthday—Founders’ Day,

January 19) will replace Monday
classes on Monday, January 21.

Reynolds Price, whose first

 

 

ment as president of the University
of Virginia, will speak at 8 p.m. Fri-
day (May 3) and 12 noon Saturday
(May 4), according to an announce-
ment by Law School Dean Charles
P. Light. No subject has been listed
for Darden’s lectures.
Public Address

The public addresses will coincide
with Washington and Lee’s alumni
reunion program for the classes of
1913, 1923, 1938, and 1953. Both law
and academic graduates and stu-
dents are expected to attend the
lectures along with non-alumni at-
torneys and students from other in-
stitutions. Members of the Washing-
ton and Lee Law School Assn. also
are expected to be on hand for the
sessions. May 4 will be Washing-
ton and Lee’s official Law Day.

The Tucker Lectures were es-
tablished at Washington and Lee in
1949 as a part of the university's
bicentennial celebration. They
honor the memory of John Ran-
dolph Tucker’s long service as
professor and dean of of the uni-
versity’s School of Law. The late
John W. Davis, an alumnus, na-
tionally-known attorney and the
1924 Democratic candidate for
President, delivered the _ first
Tucker Lectures. Orison S. Mar-
den, president of the Assn. of
the Bar of the City of New York,
was the Tucker lecturer last May.

Judges
Other judges, attorneys and edu-
cators who have participated in the
lecture series are Judge Arthur T.
Vanderbilt, Judge John J. Parker,
John Lord O’Brian, Judge Joseph C.
Hutcheson, Jr., Judge Harold R.
Medina, Dean Robert G. Story, Wil-
liam T. Gossett, Dean F. D. G. Rib-
ble, John J. McCloy, Whitney N.
Seymour, Ross L. Malone and Judge

E. Barrett Grettyman.

A former United States Delegate
to the United Nations, Darden re-
ceived his bachelor of arts degree
from the University of Virginia
and his M.A. and LL.B. degrees
from Columbia University. He also
studied at Oxford University on a
Carnegie Fellowship.

Darden served as president of the
University of Virginia from 1946 to
1959. He also represented Virginia
at the 73rd, 74th, 76th, and 77th

sessions of Congress and served two
terms as a member of the Virginia
General Assembly.

See You At

By BILL KINSEY
Friday Columnist

During the past two months I have
atempted to discuss several aspects
of the field of edu-
cation and to sub-

scrutiny our par-
ticular brand of
education here at
Washington and
_ Lee. Proposals for
reform have been
made both by my-
self and by others.
Some of these
have aroused a
great deal of stu-
dent interest; many have expressed
their agreement and their concern
over the issues involved.

| are not enrolled. Unless you are
something of a genius, you are not
going to get much done in that free
hour in the morning anyway except
possibly have a cup of coffee in the
Co-op. So why not try it? Take
|a look at the catalog and sample
some of the courses which you think
might interest you. And, it is not a
bad idea to look into some of those
you think could not possibly interest
you. You may get some surprises.

Also I urge the students to read
and write outside of what is as-
signed in class. This gives one the
valuable experience of looking
further into his own interests and
of getting to the root of many mat-
ters on his own, in other words,
the satisfaction of self-motivated
accomplishment.

 

Finally, for the student who is
most dissatisfied and who would go
further than I have here gone, I
would advise this: abstract yourself
from the curriculum. This means
that the student acknowledges that
fact that he is enrolled in a program
which makes certain demands on
him but that he stays as far from
these demands as possible. He ful-
fills all his requirements with a
minimum of effort and time and
thought. He is admitting the inade-
quacy of the established program
for his personal needs and is study-
ing entirely according to his own
plan.

This student will devote himself
fully to the courses which chal-

lenges him and throws up new
ideas for his study, but he will

shun the dull and plodding courses
and avoid the dry, wearisome pro-
fessors. If he should be forced
into such courses, and such men,
he will skim over the work, aiming
only at passing the course and get-
ting it behind him.

But this last step is not a good
one. If any great number of students
adopted this attitude, the result
would be the undermining and de-
struction of all that is good in our
present system. It amounts to a
negative approach to the very con-
cept of a university. Rather what is
needed, once again, is a general air
of student-faculty-administration
cooperation and understanding, a
desire to listen to new ideas, and a
willingness to give them a try if

 

they sound feasible.

These proposals have ranged from |
a modified cut system ‘to a method of |
education based almost entirely on/|

accept the fact that any realization
of these suggested plans will be a
long time in coming, if it comes at
all. So what are we who are here

you to flip to Peanuts. This is for
those men who have a real con-
cern in their educational process
and who do not feel completely
satisfied with what they are getting
here and now.

No, I am not going to advise such
a student to transfer somewhere
else. The grass may be greener from
our point of view, but let me assure
any who doubt it that there are
just as many if not more weeds in

Changes In Paramount Inn Symbolize

The Vanishing Herd. Many W&L

just idle conversa-

New Type

It must be admitted that Wash-
ington and Lee is attracting a dif-
ferent type of student than the old
W&L man of recent years. For better
or worse the complexion of the stu-
dent body is undergoing a change.
Talking to a member of the vanish-
ing herd, he, in a fit of nostalgia,
had this to say about the old Para-
mount and what it stood for:
“Breathes there a man with soul
so dead who has not succumbed
to tugging appeal of the Paramount
Inn while returning from classes,
recovering from an exam or retreat-
ing for his date.”

All who have enjoyed the sanc-
ticy of the "Mount will want to
share in this eulogy and perhaps
rekindle, in retrospect, the spirit

Chip and Phyllis will remain en-
graven in our memories long after
Washington and Lee and Lexing-
ton have faded into mental obliv-

than host and hostess; they were
purveyors of inspiration, consola-
tion, and expiation. They have now
departed and left a shell as a
monument to their absence. The
Paramount as we knew it no long-
er exists. One man’s opinion? I
wonder.

What's America’s Greatest Problem Today?

“What, in your opinion, is the greatest problem

facing America as a nation today?”

This is the question which Editor Andy Nea asked
me to put to a number of the students and faculty
members here on the Washington and Lee campus. It
it a question of vital importance to all of us, for our
answer or answers to it should help to determine the
future course of our lives.

Our age is one of great social unrest. It is an age of
rapid social mobility, of changing values, of great ten-
sions on ‘the international scene. Old idols, ways of
thinking and patterns of behavior, are passing away;
new ones have not yet been established.

“These changes and the anxiety resulting from
them are indicative of a lack of integration between
the various elements in our society. Americans are
questioning their way of life. We are wondering,
“Is the United States aging, losing its youthful vig-
or, vitality, and imagination?” In beginning his TV
debates with Richard Nixon, our President expressed
the feeling of the nation when he said, “I am not
satisfied,”

It is true; we are not satisfied. Americans today
are reexamining their country—the ideas upon which
it was founded, the structures which hold it together.
We have found strengths and we have found weak-
nesses. It is these latter which form the substance for
this article.

In questioning both faculty members and students
on the topic “America’s greatest problem,” I found
two entirely different approaches. The faculty members,
almost as a whole, suggested that our greatest prob-
lem lay in the confrontation of our nation and our
whole way of life by a nation alien to our in thought
and action. The students, on the other hand, think,
again almost as a body, that our greatest problems
are internal and relate to the individual as the principal
component of a free society.

Dr. Gunn clearly stated the first position. “Our
greatest problem,” he said, “is the preservation of a

free society in the face of the Sino-Soviet threat,”
Actually, this single answer is of a dual nature.
First, we must maintain the functioning integrity of
America as a nation in relation to the totalitarian
threat of communist countries. Secondly, we must
maintain freedom as a way of life within our own
country.

According to Dr. Gunn, America would defeat its
own ends if it were forced to develop an absolutist
government of its own in order to maintain effective
opposition to the absolutist governments which con-
front it. We could conceiveably lose our freedom to
ourselves through the development of bureaucracy, the
rise of a totalitarian regime in America, a powerful
military establishment, or even an economy based
almost exclusively on war-industries.

Stated in another way, this second aspect of the
problem is “the preservation of liberal Western tra-
dition in which every individual has the freedom to
develop his own talents in accordance with his own
tastes and the rights of others.”

Dr. Hayner reinforced the ideas of Dr. Gunn,
but included the relationship of America to other
nations besides those directly threatening us, when
he said that our greatest problem was that of “sur-
vival in the international scene and working out a
satisfactory modus vivendi, a way of living with
Russia, and at the same time presenting a program
that will be attractive to the so-called neutral and
borderline peoples, the underprivileged nations in
the rest of the world.”

This problem of relating ourselves to other nations
by developing and following a consistent foreign policy
is an urgent one, according to Dr. Turner. It is also a
difficult one, for two reasons: first, because America
is relatively new in her status as a world leader; and,
second, because the frequent turnover in the executive
branch of our government often brings changes or
even radical shifts in foreign policy.

Dr. Turner suggested that more American uni-

Sales Trainee Programs.

Equipped with the appropriate sticks
from Pres Brown’s the two teams,
made up predominantly of Southern
non-skaters, waged a pitched battle
for several hours on the ice rink lo-
cated at near-by Natural Bridge

Two Yankee _infiltrators, Billy
David and “Slippery” Edge Jackson,
were said to have dominated play,
but the Southern boys played credit-
ably. The two teams have promised
to themselves to practice as much as
possible and plan a rematch over
Fancy Dress weekend. The enthus-
iastic hard core even looks to a
future challenge to the informal
UVa. hocky team, but this remains
to be seen.

versities should have schools of foreign affairs de-
signed to develop in men of outstanding intelligence
and ability qualities needed in our foreign service.

Of the interviewees, only Dr. Shirey specifically
mentioned communism, which he regards “as a kind
of leviathan” representing “all that is bad and adverse
to us.” He feels that the monster communism has
grown out of all proportion in the minds of Americans
essentially because they are ignorant of it, not realiz-
ing what “its stirring parts look like.” It is essential
that we seek to find out exactly what communism is,
what it represents, what its dimensions are so that we
may come to grips with it rather than just set ourselves
“at loggerheads with a bit of amorphousness.”

The expressions of these four professors put our
greatest problem in terms of international issues.
The students, on the other hand, regard our greatest
problem as an internal one, one concerning the indi-
vidual in our society.

A statement of our problem which represents a
transition between the two points of view made by
Ken Lane. He said that “the most pressing problem in
America is keeping people loyal to democracy to such
an extent that they will be willing to sacrifice for it.”

Here the international problem is an unstated
assumption; the fact that Americans might be called
upon to sacrifice for their country, whether that
sacrifice involve time, effort, income, or life, is re-
garded the “given” in a complicated situation. This
I found talking to several students— that they re-
gard as obvious the grave danger of the Sino-
Soviet threat, and regard as our chief problem the
development of the individual in a way that he, as
a funetioning component of this society, might be
able to cope with this or any other difficulty.

Two freshmen regarded our chief problem as a
breakup of primary personal relations—“indifference
among people.” While such a statement seems to be
rather naive on the surface, I think it indicates a depth

of intuitive understanding of America’s central proeb-
lem, which, according to the professors, is “the main-
tenance of a free society in the face of the Sino-Soviet
threat.

Although a functioning nation has several parts—
laws, customs, social institutions, physical resources,
and population, the greatest of these is the people,
the indivduals who make up the nation, its sine quo

non.

It is only through these individuals that a nation,
any nation, is able to function either within itself or
in relation to other nations. It is necessary that these
individuals be able and willing to function together
in cooperation with each other and their leaders and in
accord with common ends which they consider desir-
able if they are to be at all successful in meeting any
form of major threat from outside their nation.

A nation, like an individual, can suffer from
schizophrenia. A nation divided within itself cannot
stand, but will succumb either to civil war or com-
plete internal disintegration, or will fall prey to
foreign invaders

The importance of the maintenance of human con-
tacts and understanding to the survival of America
as a nation was indicated by one interviewee who
regarded the continuation of the freedom of discussion,
debate, and compromise within our nation as essential
to our well-being.

In summary, it might be said that America’s great-
est problem today is the development of rational,
autonomous individuals who will, when given a com-
plete freedom of choice, determine to unite as a nation
devoted to the maintenance of a way of life which
allowed them to live in freedom, and have the courage
to act with prudence and foresight to remove any ob-
stacle, whether it be internal or external, which pro-
vides a stumbling block to the continuation of that
freedom which has allowed them to become what they
are.

Everybody was a star for the

contest from start to finish. The
game began with each team bat-

trol of the ball. Within the next two
minutes two H-S boys had to
leave the game; one because he tried
to smash the stands with his head
and the other because he injured
his knee attempting to play leap-
frog with General guard Brett
Thackston. This was all well and
good with the Generals who prompt-
ly increased their lead another three
points.

With two minutes to go and the
Generals ahead 70-53, Coach Mc-
Henry took out Roger Fauber and
Howard Martin who both drew a
tremendous ovation from the crowd
for their great performance. After
this, everything was anti-climatic
and the game ended with the score
standing at 73-62.

The Hampton-Sydney game was
probably the biggest upset that the
Generals have staged in a _ long
time. Possibly the largest single fac-
tor in the General’s win was Howard
Martin’s dominance of the back-
boards. The big, 6-4 center kept the
Generals in good shape with his
rebounding and great defensive play.
Roger Fauber was the game’s high
scorer with 19 points. Lou Paterno
put in his best offensive show of
the y year with 15.

Rifle Team Bows To West Virginia

A tough West Virginia rifle team
defeated the Washington and Lee
marksmen 1419-1362 Wednesday
night in Morgantown.

Sergeant Matthew’s rifle team did
their best but just could not match
the deadly accuracy of the W. Va.
sharpshooters.

After last night’s match the rifle
team’s record now stands at 1-2.
Their lone victory comes from a
close match with Georgetown Uni-

 

versity in a triangle meet. The team
has four meets left and hopes to
improve their record.

THE,

Feulser thes Ouse Again;
But Generals Lose, 64-63

A surprisingly tough Lynchburg
College team defeated Washington |
and Lee’s cagers 64-63 in a tight |
contest last night at Lynchburg.

The Generals jumped to a 20-12)
first half lead and it looked as
if they might increase their win
string to three. With about six
minutes left in the first half Lynch-
burg came alive and overtook the
Generals. For the rest of the game
the points spread never varied more
than two points. The Generals man-
aged to keep a slight lead through-
out the earlier part of the second
half, but with eight minutes to go
in the game the Hornets tied it up.
From this point on the lead shifted
hands many times. With 30 seconds
left, the Generals held a slight 63-62
advantage but Lynchburg College
star Don Merideth sank a twelve-
foot jump shot to give the Hornets a
64-63 lead. W&L then called time
out to see if they could sink that
all-important basket. Unfortunately
the Generals didn’t make it and the
game ended at 64-63 in favor of
Lynchburg.

“Bip” Fauber played his usual ex-
cellent game and was the game’s
high scorer with 23 points. This
broke a two-year jinx that Lynch-
burg teams have had on him. Previ-
ously he wasn’t able to break into
double figures.

W&L’s record now stands at 3-7.
For Coach McHenry this makes 40
losses as opposed to 20 wins.

What seems to be the trouble with
basketball at Washington and Lee?
Certainly the teams have had great
potential. In the past few years they

RING-TUM PHI

 

have had far from a perfect, near

 

decent season.

it is too bad

that this ability can’t be developed |

to any degree. This couldn’t be the
fault of our dear coach, Bob Mc-
Henry. I’ve heard reports that “Bat-
tlin’ Bob” slaves over
formations night and day. In fact
three or four times he has come up
with such elaborate offenses and de-
fenses that his opponents have had
to take as much as ten minutes to
crack them. By sheer guts, determi-
nation and no substitution W&L has
managed to compile four losing sea-

sons in the last four years of his
reign.
Rumor has it that Bob is in for

a promotion—faculty handball coach
perhaps. With his sly grin and pleas-
ant disposition Bob instilled in his
players that great German. tradi-
tion of losing.

Under coach McHenry basketball
at W&L has reached a level of our
highly renowned cut system. The
school is still behind you though,
Bob. All the students admire guts.
After all, it isn’t every coach that
will take out a player after he has
scored four straight baskets.

Two Game Play Rates
Sports Star Nomination

This week’s sport star is Howard
Martin, who was the key factor in
W&L’'s victory over Hampden-Syd-
ney.

Coach McHenry cites Martin’s out-
standing play in the past two games
as a real lift to the Generals’ quin-
tet which, now almost halfway
through the season, is beginning to
find itself.

Before Christmas, in a game with
Randolph-Macon, Martin scored 14
points and hauled in 27 rebounds.
McHenry said that Martin’s re-
bound performance was the best on

Martin is a previous letter winner
and this year started for the first

every game. His average is 8.5
points and well over 12 rebounds
per game.

Dr. Wheeler
Turns In
Resignation

Will Continue To Write

By SHANNON JUNG

Dr. J. Harvey Wheeler, co-author
of Fail-Safe and W&L professor of
political science, has indicated that
he does not plan to return to his
teaching position this September.

In a letter to Dr. Lewis W. Adams,
Dean of the School of Commerce
and Administration, Wheeler wrote,
“It would not be fair to anyone for
me to try and live half in the world
of W&L and half in the world of
research and writing.”

Hollywood Buys ‘Fail-Safe’

Wheeler has been on leave from
the Department of Political Science
to work for the Fund of the Re-
public at the Center of Study of
Democratic Institutions at Santa
Barbara, California. Wheeler’s leave
of absence, which expires this fall,
began in the fall of 1961.

Fail-Safe, his best-seller novel
about accidental nuclear war whose
movie rights have been sold to a
Hollywood company, is the result of
a collaboration between Wheeler
and Eugene Burdick, co-author of
The Ugly American,

Writing Will Be Career

Wheeler stated that he wants to
continue writing for some time. He
went on to say that he could not
face a return to a full teaching
schedule, and especially not a six-
day schedule, in addition to his writ-
ing projects. Wheeler was to be pro-
fessor of two new political science
courses beginning this fall.

At this point, he is finishing a
manuscript on War and Politics and
another one on Participational De-
mocracy. He mentioned the possi-
bility of contracting for a possible
second novel. He will continue in his
capacity as consultant for the Center
and on the consultant staff for the
Encyclopedia Britannica.

W&L Graduate

A member of the Washington and
Lee faculty since 1953, Dr. Ritz re-
ceived his LL.B. degree from the

T. C. Williams School of Law of
the University of Richmond and
holds LL.M. and §S.J.D. degrees

from Harvard University. He did his
undergraduate work at Washington

He is faculty editor of the Wash-

‘Shenandoah’
To Feature
Cunningham

The first issue of Shenandoah
in 1963, which will be published

 

later this month, will feature a lec-
ture on “The Problem of Form” de-
livered by J. V. Cunningham at
the National Poetry Festival last fall,
editor James Boatwright has an-
nounced.

The new issue will also contain
poetry by James Dickey and fiction
by Anthony Ostroff. There will be
two book reviews and several ar-
ticles.

It will be the second issue of
Shenandoah during this semester.
The first issue featured one of
E. E. Cummings’ last poems. Boat-
wright said that he now plans to
make part of his spring issue a
tribute to John Crowe Ransom on
the poet’s 75th birthday. He is not
sure of all his contributors as yet,
but says he has promises from Allen
Tate, Cleanth Brooks, and Howard
Nemerov so far.

The forthcoming Shenandoah will
include: “The Problem of Form,” by
J. V. Cunningham, poet, critic, pro-
fessor at Brandeis; a lecture de-
livered at the National Poetry Fes-
tival, Library of Congress, October
24, 1952.

An article on Lowell’s poetry by
O. B. Hardison, Jr., poet and pro-
fessor of English at the University
of North Carolina. (Robert Lowell
was one of three poets to appear
in W&L’s Glasgow Series of lectures
this year.)

“Repertory Theatre: Paris” a

sity of Indiana, working in France
on a Fulbright grant. He is doing
a study of Moliere.

“The Desperate Heart,” a short

first volume, Imperatives, was pub-
lished last year. He has also had

Morris Appointed Missionary To Africa

Malcolm Morris, SPE sophomore from Richmond, has received an
appointment as a summer missionary to East Africa. He was given the
position after interviews in Richmond last weekend. Morris will be sent
to Africa by the Virginia Baptist Student Union, which finances a program
of summer missions every summer.

One of 14 students to be chosen this year, Morris will probably be
sent to Kenya. He will work much of the time in recreational camps, and
Bible schools. Other students will go to Europe, the Caribbean, or remain
in the United States.

Changes in Registration Resulting From Failure

The office of the Dean of the College has announced that if a student
learns of his failure in a course, he must go to his faculty adviser as soon
as possible beginning February 4, 1963, if the failure is going to make
necessary a change in second semester registration. The Dean of the Com-
merce School serves as advisor for all students in commerce or majoring
in economies or political science.

No change in registration will be made before February 4. Any change,
other than those involving failures, will be made in accordance with pro-
visions of the university catalogue, page 87.

National Defense Graduate Fellowship Information

Under the National Defense Graduate Fellowship program seniors
graduating in June 1963 may apply for a three-year award, with stipends
increasing from $2,000 to 2,400 a year, together with an allowance for de-
pendents. The students must be intending to enroll in a full-time course
of study leading to the Ph.D. or similar degree.

Applications are made directly to the graduate schools offering ap-
proved programs.

The fields of study include English, linguistics, modern languages, phil-
osophy, psychology, business administration, economics, geography, history,
political science, sociology and anthropology, and mathematics and the
natural sciences. Further information is available in the office of the Dean
of the College.

committee now studying the subject.
He also said that many of the works
will be relocated. At present the
best-known of the paintings, which
normally hang in Lee Chapel, are
on display in the lobby of McCorm-
ick Library.

Some of the university’s paintings
are among America’s greatest art
treasurers. Easily the most famous
of these are those of the collection
of the Lee family which were passed
on to Washington and Lee by Gen-
eral George Washington Custis Lee,
son of Robert E. Lee and president
of the university from 1871 to 1896.

Among the Lee collection are the
famous paintings by Charles Wilson
Peale of George Washington and
General LaFayette. The painting of
Washington is valued at over $250,-
000 and is one of the first portraits
made of him. Washington was 39
years old and an officer in the
British army at the time of the
portrait (he wears a British uni-
form). Peal’s portrait of LaFayette is
also of great value.

Other paintings from the Lee col-
lection include a Gilbert Stuart por-
trait of Washington and three por-
traits of the John Parke Curtis
family by John Wallaston.

 

Freshman Discontent Rumor False;
Less Than 10 Plan Actual Transfer

Texas Boys Make Up Over Half
Of Total Considering Transfer

By Roger Paine
Tuesday Managing Editor

A recent widely-spread rumor that a large number of stu-

dents in the freshman class are

contemplating transfer to an-

other school was investigated yesterday. It was proved false.
Of a freshman class numbering around 330, only seventeen

students have applied for transfer.*
Eight of these are citizens of the
state of Texas, to which they now
wish to return. Of the remaining
nine, only five are presently dis-
pleased with W&L as an educational
institution, and not all of these are
definitely leaving.

The secretary to the Registrar
stated that “under ten students” had
asked her to mail their transcripts
to another school for consideration.
The majority of those she cited
were Texas boys, who are not neces-
sarily discontented with W&L—they
just want to return to the Lone Star
State.

The Grass Is Greener

There is probably not a freshman
in any school in the country who
has not once thought to himself:
“The grass is greener on the other
side of the mountains.” But most
freshmen get over their disillusion-
ment with college life. Several mem-
bers of this year’s freshman class,
however, have some very apt criti-
cisms of W&L.

The major criticism is on intellec-
tual grounds—W&L is, to some, a
school in which the academic is
placed above the genuinely intellec-
tual. An example cited was one
course which placed too much em-
phasis on an infinite number of de-
tails, without covering the larger
and more lasting problems which
some freshmen feel this particular
course should teach.

A State of Change

Discontent seems to center around
the present state of change in which
W&L is deeply involved. Some
unusually perceptive freshmen have
noted this change and have recog-
nized in some ways its total scope.
They said that the school seems to
be moving from its social reputation
which existed five or six years
ago to a decidedly more academic
atmosphere.

 

In five more years, they feel, the
intellectual current will be of the
sort which may allow a looser cut
system and a more liberalized sys-
tem of education. These freshmen
are first to admit that these liberal-
izing changes are taking place right
now. Placement tests are offered to)

Change ‘Too Slow’

But as one freshman put it, “I
don’t want to read in my Alumni
Journal about how Washington and|
Lee is completing its steps to liber- |
alize education and how it is elimi-|
nating the cut system.” Most of these
freshman are simply not willing to

going a period of change which ap-

very marked change.
Professors who teach freshmen

courses were severely criticized for
failing to give their classes credit for
being intelligent. “Because one fresh-
man in a class may not take his
work seriously, others are assumed
to have the same lack of sincerity
about their studies,” said one fresh-
man.
Intelligent Freshmen

It must be noted that although a
few of these views may not be in the
proper perspective or may not be
completely sound judgments, they
are nevertheless the feelings of some
of the most intelligent members of
the freshman class. For this reason
they should not be shrugged off by
anyone.

Members of the administration are
well aware of everything which has
been said above. They point out that
in any freshman class which is as
highly selective as ours, there are a
large number of students with a
very high potential. From this it
follows that there are many intro-
verts as well as extroverts. Where
the extrovert will live his life from
day to day, involving himself in the
life and institutions of his school,
the introvert may be asking him-
self some soul-searching questions.
Typical examples of this introspec-
tion would be: “Where am I going
and what am I doing and is this the
best place for me to accomplish what
I have set out to do?”

The upshot of this thinking and
worrying is what happened at Har-
vard last year: there were a phe-
nomenal number of students who
dropped out. This was the result of
a highly intelligent and introspec-
tive freshman class. Many of them,
like students here, were very good
in their secondary schools, and when
they went to Harvard, like students
who come here, they were frustrated
in the discovery that the same ap-
plication that they had used in
secondary school did not put them
in the same state of academic pre-
ferment to which they had become
accustomed.

The universal phenomenon of
freshman discontent visits W&L in
one form or another every year, and
it may appear to be increasing. It

| is only because W&L has enrolled in

each successive year a greater per-
centage of truly thoughtful, intro-
and often brilliant stu-
dents. It is their natural inclination
to examine their situation and to
wonder if it is the best for them or
not. It is a tribute to our college
that only a very few of these valu-
able students actually do leave.

Preserve Our College Personality

The January issue of The Satur-
day Review of Literature contains
an article entitled “What Makes a
College Distinctive?” It is written
by Edward D. Eddy, Jr., president
of Chatham College in Pittsburgh.
Eddy’s comments merit the attention
of faculty and students alike, for
they correspond very closely to the
criticisms directed at W&L by the
freshmen interviewed yesterday in
connection with the lead story today.

Eddy’s article deals with self-
realization, and it points out that
too many colleges, in their race for

the top rung on the academic ladder, |

have sacrificed their own personality
and individuality.
Students Today Are Eager
“The college that truly wants to
be itself will find it imperative...
to do more than merely choose what
type of student is prefers to enroll,”

 

said Eddy. He went on to enumerate
these. He pointed out that “it is no
longer necessary to force the Amer-
ican student to hit the books or to
get the idea. Today’s student has
been scared into eagerness by the

admissions hysteria.”
Students today have more crea-
tive minds than ever before. Col-

leges must be sure that this crea-
tivity is not “suffocated by inade-
quate provisions for the pursuit of
special interests.” Many freshmen at
W&L feel that there should be
more discusion clubs along the lines
of the Liberty Hall Society, which
allow free intellectual discussion be- |
tween professors and students. They |
feel that the “busy work” demanded |
in so many courses severely limit
one’s opportunity to look for the}
more important elements of educa- |
tion. |

 

Eddy also noted that today’s stu-
dent wants to put meaning into what
he learns. He is not satisfied with
a lot of trivial detail. “The colleges
do him (the student) an injustice
in not providing manifold opportuni-
ties for delving, deliberating, and
finally determining.”

This search for meaning extends
even further, and was a basic ele-
ment of yesterday’s discussion with
several freshmen. The student today
wants to “dig into the rationale for
decision-making in the 1960's.”

The entire article as published
The Saturday Review is too
long to summarize here. For the
sake of progress and a deeper un-
derstanding of a proper intellect-
ual atmosphere, we recommend
this article to everyone at W&L,
and hope that all will take the
responsibility to read it.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi
Tuesday Edition
Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

We Apologize
Publication of the Ring-tum Phi is quite often a haphazard
affair—deadlines are tight, copy is usually scarce, and staff
members quite often have other commitments (getting an edu-

cation, for example). As a result, mistakes are often made.
The article in the Friday edition which attacked Coach Mc-

Henry was just such a mistake.

The article was in poor taste, to begin with. It was a person-
al diatribe, with no reference to facts. It was purely the writer’s
opinion and had no place in a legitimate news story: opinions
belong in columns, not in unsigned sports copy. To top it off,

the article was poorly written.

The editors of the Ring-tum Phi do not consider varsity

athletics to be above criticism,

but criticism should be con-

structive, objective, and, above all, handled with tact. Last
Friday’s article violated these principles—for this mistake
and others like it the editors accept full responsibility.

To whom it may concern: we apologize.

On ‘American Hospitality’

A lot has been said lately about our exchange students, and
each fall we officially welcome them with open arms. The Ring-
tum Phi usually runs an article or a series of articles on the stu-
dents themselves, and everyone generally prides himself on his

American hospitality.

However, when the matter of personal contact with these
foreign students arises, there appears to be a shameful di-

chotomy between what we say
vately.

publicly and what we do pri-

We have noted that in several fraternity houses, when
the foreign exchange students are eating there, little or no

attention is paid them.

Surely we don’t ask that they be treated like freshmen dur-
ing Rush Week; however, common courtesy and friendliness
seem definitely to be in order. The real impressions that foreign
students get of America are not those they read about in the
Ring-tum Phi, but the results of their personal contacts with

Americans.

It seems to us that a little effort should be made towards
making these guests—of our country and of our fraternity
houses—feel a little more at ease. To date, there hasn’t been
much of this effort expended. And we wonder just what kind
of impression the foreign exchange students with us now have
developed so far of American hospitality.

Reader Questions Proposal

Dear Editor,

Several weeks before Christmas
I recall the Ring-tum Phi making a
suggestion as to professors not re-
quiring class attendance the week
prior to examinations. If I remem-
ber correctly, the paper’s proposal
included remarks about no quizzes
or papers being due at this time,
roll not being taken, etc.

Shortly after that, the faculty
took some kind of action on the
proposal. What they did exactly I’m
not sure, but it involved some kind
of nominal agreement with the sug-
gestions that appeared in the paper’s
editorial.

And evidently, that’s as far as it
went. I myself have two quizzes
and a paper this week, and none of
my professors have said a word
about not recording absences. As
far as I can gather, other students
are in the same boat I’m in.

Whatever became of this idea?
Most of the people to whom I have
talked thought it was a good one—

and many of these people included

professors. But, as usual, the Ring-

tum Phi has failed to follow up on
something that it starts. And (also,

A READER

Players Defend McHenry

To the Editor:

We have been told by a member

of the Ring-tum Phi staff that Tom

Day, a freshman, was responsible
for the article in the Friday edition
which attacked basketball coach Bob

McHenry.

We should like to inquire what
personal experience Freshman Tom
Day has acquired in his five months
at Washington and Lee which en-
ables him to editorialize as he did

on the sports page of Friday’s Ring-

tum Phi?
Freshman Day covered both the

Hampden-Sydney and Lynchburg

games for the Ring-tum Phi. In his

account of the Lynchburg game he

never hesitates to place the blame
for the defeat on the shoulders of

Coach McHenry. Yet in his report
on the Hampden-Sydney game, he
praises the individual players, but in

no instance does he see the real rea-

son for the win: Coach McHenry’s
defensive strategy.

After playing four consecutive sea-

sons under Coach McHenry, we feel,
as members of the team, justified to
criticize Day,

first for his major
misconceptions about Coach Mc-
Henry and secondly for his preten-
tious “cuteness” in editorializing
basketball games.

Far from the great potential that
Day writes of, Coach McHenry has
had to console himself with a severe
lack of height, unfortunate injuries
and untimely “flunk-outs.” Again, as
members of the team, we feel that
Coach McHenry has obtained maxi-
mum results with what individuals
he has had to work with.

Certainly Freshman Day,
casual observer of two months’
basketball, cannot find himself in
the position to facetiously criticize
that which he knows no more about
than he does.

Again, speaking for the basketball
team, we underline the fact that the
team wholeheartedly supports the
work done by Coach McHenry.

‘Madison Blasts ‘Thieves’

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi

There are low-rent tricks and then
there are low-rent tricks. But to me
there is none more low-rent than
stealing notebooks.

Every semester around exam time
there always occurs a rash of note-
book stealing. It’s a darn shame that
there are people in this school who
either take no notes or take notes
so poorly that they must resort to
taking someone else’s notebook.
These acts are not only a reflection
on these men’s character, but they
make it very hard on the owner of
the notes who has spent many hours
in class to get them.

I have heard that there are schools
where the competition is very tough
and the determination to make good
grades drives students to lie, cheat,
and steal to achieve their goals. And
as an example, it has been said that
in some schools when the teacher
mentions an article in a magazine
for the students to read, there is a
mad dash for the library. The first
man to read the article memorizes
it and then tears it out of the maga-
zine and burns it, hoping all along
he will be the only one in his class
with the knowledge of that article.

Neither the competition nor the
tactics here have yet reached that
stage, and I doubt if they ever will.
However, there is in this school a
small number of men who have no
scruples and who care nothing about
anyone but themselves.

I am writing this with a bitter
taste in my mouth, but I feel I am
justified for I am the victim of one
of these low-rent acts. I only wish
I had the time to find the scoundrel
who has stooped so low. My notes
are not that good and are barely
legible to anyone but me, but they
are mine and represent a good bit of
time and effort. I only hope that
the rat that stole them makes use
of them and does well because of
them. However, I am willing to bet
that anyone who resorts to such
tactics as notebook stealing won’t do
too well anyway. But that’s no con-
solation to me.

JOHN M. MADISON, JR.

Writer Hits Sports Story

To the Editor:

I read with disgust the article
concerning Coach Bob McHenry and
the basketball team in last Friday’s
Ring-tum Phi.

The author of this article has hit
a high point in bad taste and bad
journalism. I don’t believe I have
seen anything as irresponsible in a
high school paper.

I won’t dispute the author's right
to criticize if he feels criticism is
in order (although I do feel the
criticism was quite indiscriminate
and unfair).

I will, however, take issue with the
method of criticism. Whatever the
author has to say ought to be credit-
ed to him. In the article he says,
“All the students admire guts.” It
would seem the anonymous knife-
thrower is sorely lacking in this
admirable virtue .

As I have said the irresponsible
nature of this whole thing is disgust-
ing. I suppose the blame must rest
with Editor Nea and Sports Editor
Mongeau. Well gentlemen, I hope
you are pleased this journalistic
abomination appeared under your
auspices.

Tom Pace Praises ‘Through A Glass Darkly’

By TOM PACE

Ingmar Berman’s “Through a
Glass Darkly” began today at the
Lyric Theater. It has received world-
wide praise. The Saturday Review,
The New Yorker, Sight and Sound,
and Time magazine all held it in
high esteem. And if I can’t always
respect Time’s “I-have-to-be clever”
reviewer, at least when he rates a
film in his top ten, it usually is a
movie with merit.

I might mention that two band-
wagon jumpers, Bosley Crowther of
the New York Times and the Motion
Picture Academy also have honored
this film. I have not seen it, but I
have seen other Bergman’s and if
this is in line with his others it is
probably well worth seeing.

Period of Adjustment

I mentioned “Period of Adjust-
ment” last week, but too briefly. It
is a movie based on a Tennessee
William’s play. And _ unbelievably
enough, it is a comedy. Isobel Len-
hart has reworked the script and
done it successfully. The main source
of comedy, however, lies in ‘the
plot and the acting. Jim Hutton
and Tony Franciosa are both excel-
lent, and Jane Fonda, at the very
least, is adequate. It’s a welcome

 

the normal Williams
(the normal William’s play about
subnormal, perverted people held
together by a depressing, perverted
plot).

change from

Another Successful Comedy

The Lyric follows “Through a
Glass Darkly” with “The Sheepman”
and “Please Turn Over” in a double-
bill. I can only guess here, too. But
my guess is that anything with
Glen Ford and Shirley MacLane is
bound to have its moments of enter-
tainment, and that “Please, Turn
Over” should be another in a string
of successful British comedies.

“The Bridge” begins at the Lyric
Sunday and is a fine, well-made,
overrated movie, But overrated only
because it has been very highly
praised, and I didn’t think it deserv-
ed quite so much. However, many
have disagreed with me, so I rec-
ommend it to you with only my
reservation,

Recommends Billy Budd

There is one film coming that I
want to see. It will run the first
week of exams, Sunday through
Saturday, at the State Theater. It
“Billy Budd.” Billy Budd the
novel is a classic in American lit-
erature. The film has been well re-

is

 

ceived by almost every critic I have
read. It was written, directed, and
starred in by Peter Ustinov, who
is indeed a genius. He has proved
himself in other films, and has
supposedly fulfilled his promise in
“Billy Budd.” I recommend it with
one insignificant reservation; I have
not yet seen it.
No Critical ‘Criteria’

Several persons have asked me
what I look for in a movie, how do
I judge them, have I set up some
criteria. No, none that I refer to
for each review. Usually the film has
to strike me in some way. It must
be entertaining first. Then I have to
notice the acting (the way James
Mason made me watch his hands and
face in “Lolita’”), the direction (the
way a camera photographs a certain
scene, like the fight scenes in “The
Miracle Worker”) or the dialogue
must impress me with certain lines
(like almost any line in “Two for the
Seesaw” or “Lover, Come Back”),
I don’t necessarily watch for the
acting, the direction, the screenplay.
I would need thirty eyes. Instead
I leave it up to the film to show
itself to me.

On the Paramount Inn
Not concerning films, I have a

 

mild rebuttal to make. The Friday
edition had a column which sor-
rowfully belabored the vanishing
of the “old” Paramount Inn. I, too,
know many of the boys who used
to always go there. But I also know,
and am one of those, who still do.

It seems to me that Friday’s col-
umnist has been respectfully remin-
iscent of ‘old’ Chip and Phyllis, but
in doing so, has distastefully inti-
mated that the new management
will not be too good. This seems that
it might cause discontent with a
Lexington merchant, and that it un-
deservingly complains about his
business. I disagree, and want to
support it. The new Paramount has
at least got decent food—and an in-
teresting new clientele.

Back to the Flicks

Back to films. There is a new so-
ciety being formed. Mr. Taylor, the
organizer of ReVue, promises to
bring us good film classics. If he
can, and I am sure he will, it should
prove a success. I only hope that
this society can be instrumental in
helping students to appreciate the
really good film—the film that is
now called “arty,” “aesthetic,” or
what have you. It is the film which
has made the cinema an art.

 

Dr. Borden Discusses English Education With Reporter.

Faculty Spotlight

 

Borden Won Military Star

By DAVID SHUFFLEBARGER

When one thinks of the basic and
fundamental subjects of an educa-
tion, he usually turns first to Eng-
lish as the foundation for learning.

Dr. Arthur Ross Borden, Jr. pre-
sents us with an excellent repre-
sentative of our English Department.

Dr. Borden, one of the depart-
ment’s three professors, was born
in Boston, Mass., and attended Rox-
bury Latin School for his secondary
education.

From there he went to Harvard
University where he earned his
Bachelor and Master of Arts plus a
Doctorate in Philosophy.

Secret Service Agent

During the Second World War, Dr.
Borden began in the heavy field
artillery and then was transferred
to the Office of Secret Service. He
served throughout the Mediteranean,
in Italy, France, North Africa, and
finally in Germany.

The British Government expressed
their gratitude for his deeds by
awarding him the Officer Order of
the British Empire, while his own
country honored him with the
Bronze Star.

Teaching Lifetime Goal

Professor Borden has always had
teaching as his goal. He came to
Washington and Lee in 1952 and was
appointed to his present position in
1959. In the past academic year he
acted as head of the department. He
teaches first and second year English,
sixteenth century literature, and
contemporary literature.

 

For World War II Service

Last summer, he studied in Eng-
land at the Shakespeare Institute
located at Stratford-on-Avon, There
he did research on Shakespeare’s
history plays, a project that he has
been working on for some time.

Heads Literature Seminars

The English Department and the
Shenandoah co-sponsor the Wash-
ington and Lee Seminars in Litera-
ture, of which Dr. Borden is chair-
man.

The Seminars were founded in the
same year that he came to the uni-
versity, and bring four outstanding
literary figures to the campus each
year. Late this past year, Dr. Borden
gave several lectures in this pro-
gram.

College Board Official

Currently the pipe - smoking
gentleman has been serving on the
writing sample and advanced place-
ment committees for the College
Entrance Examination Board. He is
the chief reader for the English
Achievement, State department, and
law admission tests of the Education-
al Testing Service.

Concerning English education at
Washington and Lee, Dr. Borden
said, “The English here has a lot
of tradition behind it, and I think it
has proved itself. Students who have
majored in English and then gone
on to law, medicine and advanced
English, tell us how valuable the
knowledge they received here is.
Our courses are going through some
transition, to become more suitable

‘A Small, Blood-Sucking

Flesh- Eating

By TRACY HARRINGTON

Anybody ever call you a “small,
flesh-eating, blood-sucking animal
that comes out at night?”

Chances are, they have—without
your realizing it; for that’s the defi-
nition of a “mink,” and minks are

what the Veemies have been calling

W&L students for over 100 years.

Snaking Veemies’ Dates

According to Dean Gilliam, the
cadets thought up the term when
students developed the habit of
“coming out at night”—after the
Veemies were put to bed—to snake
Cadets’ dates.

We understand, also, that the
term—complete with definition—ap-
pears in the VMI Rat Handbook.

When we looked around, we found
a few other stories about the origin
of words that long ago were incor-
porated into the W&L vocabulary.

“Keydets,” for instance, probably
began as a derogatory term ap-
plied to the VMI cadets.

Keydets Derogatory

We couldn’t find out how or why
the term originated, but Dean Gil-
liam told us that when the student
newspaper first started at the Ins-
titute, it was called The Keydet.

VMI alumni, however, protested
to this, saying that the term was
used “offensively.” So now the news-
paper is The Cadet.

The UVa. nickname, Wahoo, was
first part of a college football cheer
that starts “Wahoo Wa, Wahoo
Wa...” And that’s all we could find
out.

 

The tradition of the Cadet’s salut-

 

Night Beast’

ing Lee Chapel evidently began
when the recumbent statue of Lee
was placed in the Chapel, according
to Col. Wm. Couper, former gradu-
ate of VMI.

Statue Was Hidden

An interesting sideline here is that
the statue, which was received at
Washington and Lee in 1875, was
kept hidden until the dedication
of the Chapel seven years later.

Finally, we discovered that Ring-
tum Phi came from an old college
cheer—which is all we'll say for
now, since that makes a good story
when we've got too much space on
the second page.

Good Coaching Plus
‘Team Effort Equals Win,

.

Basketball is a strange game. For those of us who thought
that the Washington and Lee variety of the ancient cage sport
was lower than the underside of a snake’s belly, last Tuesday

 
  

was quite a pleasant shock.

The Generals, playing as though the communists had
broken through their last line of defense and were pushing
them into the sea, devastated a crack Hampden-Sydney outfit,
73-62, in machine-like fashion.

Going into the contest, W&L was anywhere from a 15-to
40-point underdog to the second-best offensive club in the
national small college ranks, but this did not phase the oes
Generals.

Coach Bob McHenry had drilled his boys for nearly a)
week in preparation for the tough Tigers. The gratifying result
was a fantastic zone-press defense that so completely wrecked
Hampden-Sydney’s patterns that the Tigers never were able
to click.

The Tigers not only had trouble getting the ball up the
court, but then they could not work it in to their super scorer
Bill Hardin. Hardin brought a 27.9 average into the game,
and left with one of the lowest point productions in four years,
ten points.

Thanks to the zone-press and some top-notch defensive
play by captain Rodger Fauber and center Howard Martin,
Hardin made the contortions of an Indian snake-charmer look
like child’s play compared with the moves he had to make to
score his ten points.

Offensively the Generals were just as great. Firing with the
deadly accuracy of a Polaris missile, W&L sank all of its first
14 shots from the floor. Fauber and guard Louie Paterno led
this bombing attack which left Hampden-Sydney on the short
end of a 22-11 score midway through the first half.

This tremendous effort against Hampden-Sydney quickly
brings to mind another superlative effort by a Washington and
Lee basketball team—the ten-point victory over the University
of Virginia in 1961.

Certainly the win over our big brother to the North was a
great one, but Tuesday night’s smashing of the H-S Tigers
was even greater.

If you think back, Virginia had a miserable night against
the Generals, hitting something like 22 per cent of their shots
from the floor.

Hampden-Sydney, despite being out-played all night, was
no pushover. The Tigers took good shots and made a good 38
per cent.

W&L was out to win and they did.

Hats off to Coach Bobby McHenry for his excellent coach-

Washington and Lee faces a cru-

can make or break its season before

The Generals, who own a 3-7
record, face Bridgewater’s improved
Eagles Wednesday night and Old
Dominion’s Monarchs Saturday
night.

Bridgewater Tough

One of the three W&L wins came
at Bridgewater and Coach Bobby
McHenry is hoping to make it two
in a row over the Eagles.

With superstar Rodger Fauber, the
nation’s fourth small college re-
bounder, going great guns, and
junior Tom Supak back in the line-
up after a month-long illness, the
Generals should be at top strength
for the Eagles.

In their last four outings the
Eagles have bowed to Old Domin-
ion, 88-68; Randolph-Macon, 71-61;
and Hampden-Sydney, 109-84; and
whipped Lynchburg College, 72-62.

Of course, W&L mauled Hampden-

victim to an aroused Lynchburg
quintet, 64-63.

Bridgewater’s attack is a double

Washington and Lee with a victory
in the 200-yard breaststroke. Again
fine swimming by freshman Bokin-
sky enabled the Generals to finish
one-two in a tight race which saw
only two seconds separate the first
three men. Chase’s winning time
was 2:40.6.

Washington and Lee jumped off to
a 7-0 lead by grabbing the 400-yard
medley relay in 4:30.6 Art Broad-
dus, Chase, Dud Warwick, and Herb
Jahncke swam the relay.

Wake Forest, a member of the
Atlantic Coast Conference, pulled
to within six points with a first in
the 200-yard freestyle, but that was
as close as they came until the
meet’s final event.

Freestyle sensation John Wolf
captured a pair of seconds for the
Generals in the 200-yard freestyle
and the 500-yard freestyle.

Lifter Gets 2 Thirds

Freshman John Lifter picked up
two thirds in the 200-yard individ-
ual medley and the 500-yard free-
style.

On English Education

On English education in the United
States in general, Dr. Borden said
that he felt that “most people and
especially engineers” are becoming
more concerned with the necessity
of learning how to express them-
selves capably. After some study,
the General Electric Company said
that the one course most valuable
to their engineers was literature, ac-
cording to Dr. Borden.

He also feels that after the Rus-
sians sent up the sputnik, interest
perked up in the sciences with the
result that studies were made to
improve these courses,

(Continued from page 2)

MOST IMPROVED DEPARTMENT—For five years

Borden, a bachelor, has contribut-| \W/gL’s basketball team has had to scrap and scrap because it

lacked a big man. This year the Generals found a big man—

partment—and we hope he is with| 6-5 Howard Martin—and he’s already paying dividends.

Martin started slowly, but came into his own in the final

‘game before Christmas when he scored 14 points and snared

a season-high of 27 rebounds as the Generals whipped Penn-

sylvania Military College.

The big junior continued this fine pivot play against Hamp-

'den-Sydney, tallying 10 points and grabbing 13 rebounds.

Martin’s rebounding and newly-found scoring punch can well
be cited as the difference in the Generals win over the Tigers, if
any single performance can be called the difference.

OPENS TONIGHT

Ball Begins
At Nine

By GARETH ADEN
Executive Editor

“The South’s most out-
stand collegiate social event,”
better known as Washington
and Lee’s Fancy Dress Week-
end, officially opens this after-
noon for the fifty-fourth time
since its beginning in 1907.

Count Basie, internationally
known band leader and his 17-
piece orchestra will play for the
Fancy Dress Ball tonight. Around
midnight Stan Rubin with his clar-
inet and his renowned Tiger Town
Five will take over for a Dixieland

“Jam_ session.”

The concert Saturday night will
feature Nina Simone, jazz pianist
and singer, whose record, “I Love
You Porgy,” started her popular
singing career and has kept her
in the national spotlight for sever-
al years. Miss Simone has been
classified as one of the “most excit-
ing entertainers” currently on the
night club circuit.

The Faney Dress Weekend, run-
ning from February Ist to 3rd, will
begin this afternoon with a “Play-
boy Theme” cocktail party. The
party is given by Phi Kappa Sigma
in honor of Ham Emory, President of
the 1963 Fancy Dress at the May-
flower Motor Inn from 4:00-6:00.

The ball this evening will be held
in Evans Dining Hall and will com-
memorate the Civil War Centennial.
From all indications the costume
sales were the most successful in
years, and it appears that the floor
will be crowded with many couples
dancing to the “big band” sounds of
Count Basie.

Basie came into musical fame
around 1939 when he made his first
Decca recordings and his first ap-
pearance at Carnegie Hall. “One
O’clock Jump,” one of his first re-
cordings, is probably his best known
release. During the ‘Forties’ Basie
continued to put out top releases
and even broke into the movie in-
dustry in the picture Reveille with
Beverly.

After several years with a small
jazz combo, Basie was back with his
band in 1951. By 1954 he was named
“top jazz band” in Down Beat's
critics’ poll. That same year Count
Basie and his group made their
first European tour which proved
to be a spectacular success. He is
still in demand in all parts of the
continent.

Stan Rubin and his Tiger Town
Five, who will play for the jam ses-
sion after the ball, are of no less
national or international fame. Ru-

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Friday

Edition

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

 

Welcome

The Ring-tum Phi staffs wish to welcome everyone to this,
the 54th annual Fancy Dress Ball. We are glad you could come,
and we hope you have an enjoyable weekend.

The University is especiall

y proud of Fancy Dress for its

role in putting W&L on the collegiate map. At various times
in its history the Ball has been broadcast by two radio networks,

and covered by two magazines

. The New York Times gave it

the name it proudly bears; ‘The South’s outstanding collegiate

social event.”

Fancy Dress weekend is a magnet for friends, alumni, and

students; girls from all over th

e country and our friends from

Harvard, UNC, neighboring VMI, the University of Florida,

and many other schools. It is as big an attraction as Homecom-

ing or a Mock Convention.

Fancy Dress President Ham Emory and Dance Board Pres-
ident Frank Young deserves praise for the imagination, creativi-

ty, and time they have put into
we cite the plans for the figure

this year’s Ball. As one example,
quoted in Young’s column else-

where on this page. Our thanks also go to Emory’s vice-presi-
dents and the Dance Board Advisory Council.

So we welcome you, wherever you're from. We’re escaping
the mid-winter boredom and the horror of exams, as you well
may be. This year’s Fancy Dress Ball promises to be the best
way we've ever had of doing so.

 

Should Cocktail Parties
Be Sponsored By Classes?

By PETE ALFORD
Friday Columnist

“Whatever be thy fate today,
Remember, this too shall pass
away.” —old proverb

It seems inappropriate to interject a
quasi-serious note at this time of
ee revelry and mer-
iv % - ry-making, but we

Dee oe feel a suggestion
Ss coming on and
' must get it into

print before it

fades .

Actually we
don’t possess an
original idea but
4 rather would like
to add to some-
thing already said.
It was suggested
edtorially in the Ring-tum Phi sev-
eral weeks ago that the cocktail
parties for Openings, Springs and
Finals weekends be financed by an
entire academic class since the Pres-
idents of these dance sets starting
next year will be the presidents of
the respective classes.

We feel this a sound suggestion
for two obvious reasons. First, it
will give the class officers some-
thing to do and secondly it will
ease the financial burden on the
individual houses who, under the
present plan, have had to assess their
members heavily to pay for one of
these parties.

Through EC

Of course now comes the problem
of through what channels this wor-
thy plan of the Ring-tum Phi (or
whoever first thought of it) must
proceed. It would seem that the EC
would have final word since three
entire classes would be affected
financially by the new plan.

We would like to take this op-
portunity to present something in
connection with Fancy Dress, the

  

Alford

annual debauchery we are celebrat-
ing now. I feel that for several rea-
sons the President of Fancy Dress
should be the President of the LF.C.:
this would give more prestige(?) to
the council, and possibly the F.D.
weekend cocktail party costs could
be shared equally by all fraternities
and top-rate entertainment would
be afforded.

Need for Crisis

Crisis Department. Looking back
over this first semester from a
“yellow” journalistic point of view,
we see nothing comparable with last
year’s Martin Luther King episode.
We hope this new semester will pro-
vide our readers with some hot is-
sues.

Those of you who are still with
me must be hiding from your date’s

behind the Ring-tum Phi. It can’t
be that bad. Go out and have a
good time. Remember, classes on
Monday!

South’s Best Parties
In 5 Decades Of FD

By KEN LANE
Assistant Managing Editor

Fancy Dress has come a long way
since it was introduced at Washing-
ton and Lee 56 years ago. In fact,
the 1907 crowd of 20 couples has
been increased to more than 1200
couples (the expected turnout this
year) and the cost of the dance
weekend has spiralled from $44 to

$8,000.

In 1907 Annie Jo White, presi-
dent of the Dramatic Club, pre-
sented the “Ball Masque” as a
reward for the successful actors
in the group. More than half of
those attending the dance were
first-classmen at VMI and a slend-
er crowd of 40 danced in the old
gymnasium, on the site of the
present chemistry building. The
$44 cost was paid by Dramatic
Club profits.

$8,000

Today W&L launches an $8,000
extravanganza. Stan Rubin and the
Tiger Town Five, and Count Basie
and his 17-piece orchestra will tally
up a total expense of $5,000 while
$2,500 will be paid to the Nina
Simone group. The costumes will
cost an additional $750; and the dec-
orations and ever-present “miscel-
laneous” will cost still another $450.
Dance Board President Frank Young
expects over 2,500 to attend the first
night.

Fancy Dress has had an interest-
ing history—a history which has
included every theme imaginable
and most of the nation’s big-name
bands. There have been constant
changes in the organization and
method of presentation.

 

The California Ramblers?

For instance, it wasn’t until 1929
that a student president of the danc-
ing set directed the affair. In that
year the California Ramblers en-
tertained the partying gentlemen.
They came from exotic, far-off
Farmville, Va.

But in later years, the orchestras
of some more popular groups jour-

neyed to Lexington. In 1936 Profes- |’

sor Kay Keyser of the Kollege of
Musical Knowledge arrived. He was
followed by Eddie Duchin, Hal
Kemp, Benny Goodman and Woody

Herman. In more recent years we've |

danced to the Dorsey Brothers and
Les Elgart.
National Publicity
Publicity-wise, Fancy Dress has
attained national notice on several
occasions and, finally has been titled
what the vice-president for publicity

| perennially calls “The South’s Out-
| standing College Social Event.” In

 

| 1932 Walter Winchell came to FD

from Broadway and introduced the
dance set to the nation in a special
radio broadcast. And almost every
year, until several years ago, Roa-
noke radio and television stations
rebroadcast tapes and films of the
ball.

Fancy Dress has indeed had a long
and colorful history, but there are
still anomalies about its origins.
Some say that Annie Jo White was a
librarian here in 1907 and that the
ball started, not in the old gym-
nasium, but in a room above what is
now McCrums, at a party Miss White
gave for her friends. But regardless
of how it started, Fancy Dress has
changed in ever manner, to become
the most talked-about social event
among the colleges of the South.

 

Weekend For Some
Is A Social Disaster

By SANDY FENN
Friday Columnist

For some it was the leading col-
legiate social event in the South,
but for me it was
just another social
disaster. You see,
I had this perfect-
_ ly wild and gor-
s geous date coming
in from the North
and all. I had giv-
en her the big
pitch one night
when I was slight-
ly ripped, and had
allowed as how
Fancy Dress was
the greatest small college weekend
any girl could ever hope to attend.
Boy, that brought her ears up just
like a blasted Doberman Pinscher,
because she really was a bit of a
social climber. In fact, if you looked
at it perfectly objectively you’d have
to admit she could outclimb one of
these skinny little natives out in the
Pacific who scurry up palm trees to
shake out coconuts and stuff like
that.

Anyway, she was supposed to call
me Friday afternoon and tell me
how the devil she was getting from
Washington to Lexington so I could
meet her. Well, I sat there all af-
ternoon waiting for her to call or
something, but she didn’t. All I could
think of was that I was missing the
cocktail party with the Brothers
Four and drinking sours. By the
time she finally did call at 6 o'clock

Fenn

I was sure missing the sours and the |!
lot more| >

Brothers Four a whole
than I was missing her, I ean tell
you.
The Fun Begins

Well, I asked her where the duce
she was hiding herself, and she
said she was in Lexington at the
hound station. Can you beat that?
She takes the foarming grey dog
from Washington to Lexington and
never even lets me know it. Cripes,
the whiskey sours I could’ve had
while she was on that thing.

Anyway, I tried to play it cool

and all and didn’t bother to men-
tion just how much I hated her at
that moment. Instead I told her

“gosh, wasn’t it awful for her to
ride the bus,’ and “wow, wasn’t it
wonderful that she was finally here,”
which it wasn’t. Then I went to get
her.

Actually when I saw her, I felt
pretty glad I had asked her after
all, because she really did look fine
standing there in front of the hound
station. It didn’t occur to me right
then that Whistler’s Mother would
probably look great too, standing
in front of that backdrop, but that’s
beside the point. Anyhow, I told
her she looked great and all in that
dress. She told me that was swell,
because her bag hadn’t come and I

 

 

might be seeing quite a bit of her
that weekend in it. What’s a guy
supposed to do?

And Continues

Well, later on that night she went
to put on her Fancy Dress costume.
and I got the surprise of my life.
Not only was it the wrong costume,
it was also the wrong size. The
theme was “Shakespeare Rides
Again” or something, and we were
supposed to go as Venetians. You
know, long velvet robes and all that
stuff. Well, there I am in my velvet
robes and she comes out as a snazzy
Cleopatra with an outfit about thirty
sizes too small, only she didn’t know
it.

That was the only thing that made
me go to the dance. I mean, I felt
like a pretty big fool in my robes
and all when she was Cleopatra. But
she looked like the Playmate of

Unusual Figure

The figure for this year’s Fancy
Dress Ball will add a new concept
to W&L dances. Following their
introductions, FD President Ham
Emory, his vice-presidents, and the
fraternity presidents will form the
Confederate flag and the flag of the
United States. Colored crepe paper
will be utilized for these formations.
Following the figure there will be
a brief intermission, after which
dancing will begin.

Count Basie’s internationally fa-

SCENE of the festivities during last year’s Fancy Dress

Ball in Evans Dining Hall.

Mayflower Manager Cites
Cocktail Party Episodes

By HARRY MEEM
Friday Reporter

John Spanburgh, the manager of
the dining room at the Mayflower
Motor Inn, will be a busy man this
afternoon.

It’s not that he expects to do a
booming business in complete din-
ners, hors d’oeuvres, appetizers and
so forth to cater to the diversified
appetites of the assorted crowd of
dates, Wahoos, and other such visi-
tors to Fancy Dress. Spanburgh has
been busy all day, and will be busy
into the night, setting up and clean-
ing up after the cocktail party.

He’s been doing this for eight
years, two or three cocktail parties
a year. In the course of this time,
as the man in the middle, he’s
had to put up with assorted guff
from various and sundry groups.
For instance:

He usually gets a few complaints
per party from some of the town’s
upright citizenry who abhor the
sight of students and/or dates stag-
gering down the sidewalks and
throwing up in driveways. The
citizens want to know what sort of
nefarious den of iniquity he’s run-
ning, letting America’s clean-living
youth get drunk. And some of the
students like to complain about the
weak drinks (which by the way is
a matter of policy to which we'll
return).There’s occasional trouble
with the entertainers too.

There was one group. which
had two managers working ahead
of them by a few hours, Span-
burgh got a tip from a student
that the advance men waited for
the crowd to gather, then rifled
through coats. So rather than go
back upstairs after the party start-
ed, he took up a position by the
coat room and waited.

“One of them (the managers) came
up to me and told me a fellow
wanted me upstairs,” he went on. “I
told him to tell this fellow if he
wanted me he could come down to
talk to me. The guy went away,
but came back a little later and said
I was wanted upstairs on the phone.
I said to tell them to call back later.
They gave up after that.”

Just prior to one dance weekend,
the Pine Room had been used for
a dinner at which the governors of
Virginia and Maryland were present.
The room was then set up to feed a
well-known Negro piano player and

his orchestra. The leader came in

drunk.

“He gave me a hard time about
eating in the basement,’ Span-
burgh continued. “Told me ‘that
practice went out years ago’ and
that he wasn’t going to eat there.
He wanted to eat in the main
dining room.

“T got fed up with this business.
‘Look,’ I told him, ‘we had two
governors there last night. If
they’re not any better than a second-
rate piano player like you, I give
up.

The biggest crowd ever drawn
to a Pine Room cocktail party was
2,600 to hear the Kingston Trio
several years ago. The Brothers four
drew 2,200. The average crowd for
a Fancy Dress party ranges upward
from 1,800, depending on the at-
traction. The crowd for Openings
is about 800, for Springs 1,400.

For the most part, Spanburgh has
no trouble with W&L students. “My
main worry,’ he added, “is the
crowd they attract from other
schools.” There’s an _ occasional
broken window, and last spring
there was the case of the broken
door. Three students crashed into it
and tore it off the hinges to get a
coat. Spanburgh hasn’t been paid
for the damage yet.

Spanburgh buys the mixers for
the parties at cost. The alcohol is
delivered Thursday night or Friday
morning, an average of 160 fifths.
It’s usually gone by 5:45.

Spanburgh hires the bartenders,
and instructs them to start mixing
the drinks at the rate of a pony of
liquor per drink, cutting back the
alcohol rate as the party gets
oiled. The liquor lasts longer, and
the affair is quieter that way.

The police? Not much of a bother,
aside from cars parked at all con-
ceivable angles. “There was one
party,” Spanburgh recalled, “where
one of them came up to me and
asked ‘Where's the driver of 433-
332?’ or some such number. That
was the time we had 2,600 for the
Kingston trio. I just told him ‘In
there’ and wished him luck.”

At one party several years ago
the sponsoring fraternity was serv-
ing whiskey sours mixed in 10-
gallon erocks. About 5:15, the sup-
ply was almost gone, and what was
left in two of the crocks was “the

Because of tie votes at two po-

Six players were unanimous

yards in 119 carries and completed |
37 of 87 passing attempts for four

Other All-Conference choices were
ends John Madison of W&L and
John Ashcraft of Southwestern,
tailback M. L. Agnew of Sewanee,
fullback Tommy Kessee of W&L and
halfback Bill Harwood of South-

Center's Bob Hourigan was
triple-threat quarterback who hurt
opponents with his passing, run-
ning and ball handling. He also
was the conference punting lead-
er averaging 33.8 yards per boot.

Washington and Lee’s backfield

I couldn’t try to argue that with

but also where it was strangling
her. So we left, and went back to

seeing her in that Cleopatra outfit
I could easily understand how such
a thing could be possible. Anyway,
she spent the rest of that night,
and most of the next day, sulking
around in her room and calling me
every two and half seconds to find
out where her bag was. Cripes, you’d
have thought I was hiding it from
her or something.

Be Prepared
Finally Saturday afternoon she
got real good and mad, walked

right down to the hound station in

her one fine dress, and took the
bus back to Washington. Some
weekend, man was it ever great.

Still, I couldnt’ really blame her for
not wanting to go around all week-
end in the same dress. Therefore,
just to show her I have no hard feel-
ings after all this time, I’ve invited
her down to Fancy Dress again.
And if the same thing should hap-
pen twice, at least I'll be prepared.
She dosen’t know it yet, but I sent
off and, in keeping with this year’s
theme, ordered seven different bunny
outfits for her—each about thirty
sizes too small.

The jam session, a new idea this
year, is an attempt to liven up the
late hours of the dance.

The decorations and costuming of
tonight’s ball should make it one of
the most colorful in W&L’s history.
The costumes will range from north-
ern and southern Civil War uniforms
to “Rhett Butler” and diplomatic
attire. Flags, platforms, and columns
will be placed through the hall to
enhance the effect.

“We had to do something. The
fellow in charge of the party was
sick, running out so soon. We finally
sent a boy up to the kitchen to get
the iced tea we had prepared for
supper, and mixed it with the re-
mains of the whiskey sours.

“There was a lot of lemon in the
mix, and just enough alcohol to be

drink they’d ever tasted.”

Two Essay Contests
Open To Students

Two essay contests are now being
held which are open to all Wash-
ington and Lee students. The two
contests are the Cincinnati Society
and the Virginia Colonial Dames.
The first offers an award of $50 and
the second offers $200. The Colonial
Dames contest is for students of
Virginia colleges.

One essay may be submitted to
both contests. The essay must be
4,000 words or more and written on
an original subject in Virginia col-
colonial or military history. The es-
says must be in the hands of the
different judging committees by May
20, 1963.

Anone interested in these contests
may obtain a list of suggested topics

 

from C. W. Turner in Room 1,

Lewis F. Powell .

 

Named To Head |

Bar Association

Lewis F. Powell, Jr., W&L alum-

nus, Richmond attorney, and civic} |

and education leader, has been
named president-elect of the Amer-
ican Bar Association at its mid-year |
meeting in New Orleans.

He will assume the post formally
in August, and a year later, in Aug-

ust, 1964, he will move into the
presidency.
Powell will succeed Walter E.

Craig, of Phoenix, Ariz, the current
president president-elect. The cur-
rent president is Sylvester C. Smith,
Jr., of Newark, N. J.

Last August 6 Powell was elected
to represent the region of Virginia, |
Maryland, and the District of Co-
lumbia on the board of Governors
of the American Bar Association,

Visited Russia
In July, 1958, he visited the Soviet

Union as a member of a six-man
delegation from the ABA to study

.. pro- |!
vide intellectual stimulation to both | |

 

 

the Russian legal system and ex- |
change ideas between Russian and |
American lawyers.

What he saw behind the Iron Cur- |
tained moved him to urge on his
return that American education re- |
evaluate its curriculum in light of |
the cold war and the challenges of |
the space age.

To Combat Communism
Powell has urged the ABA to gO |
on record in favoring a course on)
communism in secondary schools |
as “an effective means of contrast- |
ing the merits of freedom of Western |
democracy and the 20th century |
capitalism and the brutal and re-|
pressive characteristics of “dictator- |
ship of the poletariat.”

As chairman of the City School |
Board he made a similar proposal |
to the National School Boards As- |
sociation and he has continued to
work for it as a member of the
State Board of Education.

Background

A member of the State Board of
Education for the past two years,
he served 11 years with the Rich-
mond School Board, nine of them
as chairman.

In 1960, for services to schools and
city, he was given the Good Gov-
ernment Award by the Richmond-
First Club.

The Virginia Education Associa-
tion gave him its distinguished serv-
ice award in 1958, and Hampden-
Sydney and Washington and Lee
colleges have conferred honorary
doctor of laws degrees upon him.
He holds academic degrees from
Washington and Lee and Harvard.

Judicature Society

He served for three years on the
board of directors of the American
Judicature Society and is a former
president of the Richmond Bar As-
sociation.

Powell, 55, is a senior member
of the law firm of Hunton, Williams,
Gay, Powell and Gibson. He is mar-
ried and has four children.

Powell will become the second
Richmonder to serve as ABA presi-
dent in this century. Henry St.
George Tucker was president in
1904-05 and his father John Ran-
dolph Tucker, was ABA president

 

in 1892-1893.

Bernard Shaw’s “Don Juan in Hell”
from “Man and Superman.”

Other major roles in the comedy
are held by: John Dunnell as
Orgon, who is deluded by Tar-
tuffe: Susan Dunnell as Elmire,
Orgon’s wife; Andy Leonard as
Cleante, Elmira’s brother; and
Lisa Tracy as Dorine the maid,

Andy Adelson, who has worked
both as an actor and backstage for
the Troubs, will serve as assistant
director for this show. He will aid

Moses, 28 and a native of Dan-
ville, is a designer with an archi-
tectural firm in Houston. He studied
under Dr. Junkin during his under-
graduate years at Washington and
Lee from 1952 to 1956. He also
studied interior design at the Pratt
Institute in New York City. A for-
mer U.S. Navy Officer, Moses was
a design consultant with a Dallas,
Tex., firm before moving to Houston.

Many of the painting and drawings
in the exhibit were done by Moses

Automatic Rule
Forces 31 Men

Figures released this week show
that thirty-one students were forced
to sever their connections with the
university due to their first semester
grades. Of these, 15 were freshmen,
14 were sophomores, and two were
juniors.

These figures run slightly higher
than last year, and slightly lower
than the year before. Last year nine
freshmen, 16 sophomores, and three
juniors and seniors were dropped.
In February of 1961, a total of 22
freshmen and 12 upperclassmen fell
under the Automatic Rule.

Contrary to rumors circulating
about the campus, the number of
students transferring out at the end
of the first semester was small. The
Registrar’s Office has thus far re-
corded about 10 transfers and two

withdrawals. Most of these were| John M. Gunn, assistant professor

There were three transfer studens
admitted to Washington and Lee at
the beginning of this week. These
students were: Harold E. Klick from
Louisiana Polytechnic Institute,

Our Campus Book Store...
A Disgrace To The School

With the beginning of a new semester everyone is running
around attempting to get themselves organized. As always,
one of the major parts of this is the furious and often futile
attempt to secure the proper text books for one’s courses. By
this we refer to the conditions that exist in our campus book
store. Here, the student often finds that it is impossible to
secure the proper books for the courses for which he is regis-
tered.

All too often, there are not enough books to go around for
a course. This is almost inexcusable. Preliminary registration
allows a rough estimate to be made of the demands for a
book; however, these demands are seldom satisfied. It would
seem that those in charge of the book store would order more
than enough books for a course as they may always be returned
if they are not sold. Possibly this may be too much trouble.

One thing that we can say for the book store is that they
always are willing to order books, but the semester is often
half over before they arrive. By this time, a student may have
fallen behind in his work. Of course, it could be argued that one
could take the initiative and borrow books from others but
we feel that a student should be given an opportunity to have
his own book immediaely and not have to scrounge around in
an attempt to use the books of others.

In addition, our book store is far behind those on other
college campuses. Besides the above-mentioned faults, our book
store does not provide even a semblance of a selection of popu-
lar works. When everyone is attempting to raise the academic
standards and intellectual atmosphere of the school, one would
think that a good and adequate selection and supply of books
would be considered. Apparently it has not. When one stops
to consider, there is nowhere in Lexington tht ony may find a
reasonable selection of good books.

Another area of perennial complaint about the book store
is the seemingly excessive prices that are charged. Of course,
we are told that only a modest profit is made on the books
but when one can purchase some of the books out-of-town
stores at considerably lower prices, one begins to wonder.
Many times, a student’s book bill for a single semester can be
as high as sixty dollars. For many, it is often difficult to meet
this expense.

It would seem that this school would organize some sort of
book exchange as have many other schools. In the case of
exchanges, good used books are available to students at rea-
sonable costs. Unfortunately we have no such arrangement.

By now it should be quite evident that there are many
shortcomings in our book store on this campus. Unfortunately,
there is little that can be done. The book store is a monopoly.
They are free to do almost as they wish. It would be our hope
that Washington and Lee will wake up to this situation and take
some remedial action.

Our Traditions Considered
To Be Worth Preservin g

Editor, the Ring-tum Phi
Dear Sir:

There seems to be much confusion
nowadays in the students’, perhaps
mainly freshmen’s, minds concerning
the value of Washington and Lee’s
“traditions.” I believe there exists
some uncertainty even in the minds

 

and places to be either unwise or
unenforceable, I would wish that
they reconsider this opinion. If
they do believe, however, a state-
ment to this effect would perhaps
clear the air for further discussion.
There are conceivable compro-
mises, such as conventional dress
enforced by individual fraternities

Concentration Of Power In Unions
Attacked As Threat To The Economy

By SENATOR BARRY GOLDWATER

In my understanding of the Constitution, the intent written into it by
our Founding Fathers was the prohibition against the gathering of power
in any one branch of our tripartite system of government or any segment of
our society.

We are witnessing in our National Government today, and we have for
nearly 3 decades, the movement of more and more rights away from the
people and the States into the hands of the bureaucrats in Washington.
And we have witnessed how this power can be used to benefit one seg-
ment of the economy, giving it monopolistic power.

I refer specifically to the concentration of power in the hands of
labor leaders of today. This power came about as the result of Feder-
al legislation. Its correction can only come through congressional
action which would remove those provisions of existing law which
confer a privileged status on labor unions. This exempt position is
not related to the unions’ bargaining power in legitimate labor-
management disputes.

I would suggest the tremendous concentration of potential power in
the hands of labor is contrary to the public interest, and in “the public”
I include the working union members.

Labor unions enjoy many special privileges and immunities under
Federal law which are creative of power. By far the most important
of these is the exclusive right to represent all the employees in the
unit for purposes of collective bargaining, even if the union has
been selected as a bargaining agent only by a narrow majority, which
in many circumstances under our existing law, in fact, constitutes
only a minority.

There is an unconscious tendency on the part of many to regard labor-
management relations as the exclusive concern of the parties directly
involved—i.e., of the union and employer.

Where a setilement is reached as the result of collective bargain-
ing and without the intervention of a work stoppage resulting from
either a strike or a lockout, it is safe to say, almost without exception,
that in reaching the settlement none of the negotiating parties paid
the slightest attention to its future impact on the economy of the Na-
tion or its effect on the public interest.

The public is the overlooked body in most of the legislation written
in the Congress of late, particularly in the field of labor-management re-
lations. There are protections written into the labor-management law, and
while they are not adequate, they exist; but the tendency today is to ignore
them and by this action to further ignore the important role the public
plays in any labor-management dispute.

It behooves us to examine the nature of the continually recurring
labor crises in the United States. Even a cursory examination will
reveal one obvious truth: that labor unions have access to to far too
much for the good of the economy or health of the Nation.

Now it surprises no one to realize the immense size and the great
economic strength possessed by American unions today. It is worth noting,
however, that big labor did not gain its present vital position in our society
wholly, or even primarily through its own efforts.

The Federal Government, that ever-present arbiter, policeman,
and entrepreneur of American life, has made organized labor
what it is today.

Just to give you an idea of the preferred position held by today’s union
in the economic scheme of things, I have compiled a list of special priv-
ilege, immunities and rights and powers enjoyed by labor unions under
the Federal law.

And let me emphasize at the outset that most of these special consid-
erations may have been justified when they were initially given to the
labor movement because of their weakness and lack of size. However, pos-
sible justification from a historical standpoint certainly doesn’t justify their
continued existence in today’s era of monopolistic union power.

The list I refer to is as follows:

1, Almost total immunity under the anti-trust laws.

2. Immunity from taxation.

3. Immunity from injunctions by Federal courts.

4. Authority to use union funds for purposes not related to collective
bargaining even where union membership is compulsory.

5. Power to compel workers to join the union as a condition of con-
tinued employment.

6. The right of a union selected by a majority of the workers to
bargain for all employees. This includes the right to bargain for those

of certain Assimilation Committee
members whether conventional dress
need be worn to and from labora-
tories, or at what point a careless
tie becomes no tie for the Commit-
tee’s purposes. There seems to be
an absence of leadership from some
corner from which it should be com-
ing.

There seems to be discontent on
campus as a result of the well-
known Martin Luther King deci-
sion of last year. Unfortunate
though many may feel this deci-
sion was, it does not, in this opin-
ion necessarily sound a death-knell
of any kind for Washington and
Lee. There would seem little rea-
son, therefore, to wear ties at half-
mast in mourning

I have returned to Washington
and Lee to graduate after time in
the Army and at Southwestern-at-
Memphis, an institution which in
more ways than one sense looks to
W&L for leadership. I recall past
years here when there was a collec-
tion of pretty good men and boys
all wearing coats and ties. In years
such as those, Washington and Lee
met Wyoming in the Gator Bowl
and defeated Princeton in the Col-
lege Quiz Bowl. Those who would
wish to see such years return will
not help things by knocking W&L
tradition. Let us not confuse aban-
donment of tradition with liberal-
ization of atmosphere.

If the Executive Committee and
others in authority believe strict
conventional dress at all times

 

and the IFC, with non-fraternity
men free to dress as they please,
but I am sure this is recognized
as an inferior solution to the prob-
lem.

It is argued by some that the
proper solution will occur when the
Assimilation Committee is abolished
entirely, and enforcement of con-
ventional dress occurs spontaneously.
This might be an interesting exper-
iment, but, in any case, in order
for conventional dress to stand as
an ideal it must, it would seem, be
defined by the Executive Commit-
tee or by some superior authority
as being proper and called for at
all times and at all places within the
Town of Lexington.

Sincerely,
JOHN A. LACKMANN

BY THE EDITORIAL STAFF

The budding of the new semester
affords an opportunity for the Ring-
tum Phi editorial page to pause and
take inventory of itself. “Self-
criticism is the rod of divination,”
as an old expression goes. And like
any top-notch newspaper staff, we
simply refuse to be satisfied, however
great our achievement may be. What
we resolve to do is look beyond
the shower of compliments we con-
stantly receive and try to pick out
what’s left to be desired.

What we are trying to avoid is
the idea of merely filling up space.
We confess that there might be some
readers who feel it’s a waste of time
to turn beyond page one except to
read Peanuts (thank goodness for
Peanuts!)

Is this just human nature that
people shy away from intellectual
stimulation? However true this
may be, we of the editorial staff
will never give up. We stand
perched as Ulysses’ sirens ever
beckoning the reader with our
singing. If we are persistent, we
are bound to hit the right tune.

If you'll recall, the second page
has not failed to offer original ideas.
These have included proposals for
more progressive education, for a
new cut system, and for review be-
fore examinations.

Perhaps we have offered an over-
dose of academic subjects. Or is it
that the ideas are all of the same
nature and consequently lose their
stimulus for the reader?

We have thought and thought

 

about this problem, and after the
third case of beer we finally drew
several pertinent conclusions.

Our first problem is an age-old
one, i.e., that the prophets and seers
have lost touch with the common
masses. Observing campus life
through their ivory towers, they fail
to discern the actual needs within
the student body.

Now at this point, the reader may
claim he doesn’t have any needs.
That is our very problem! If the
reader is going to be that way about
the whole thing, then it is up to
the Ring-tum Phi to start finding
some needs for you. We contend,
then, that you may not know you
have these needs, but by Jove you
are going to get them if it’s the
last thing we do.

This campus just isn't healthy
if our “angry young men” don't
have something to complain about.
Columnist Pete Alford, who isn’t
with us today because of illness,
pointed out in the Fancy Dress
Edition (remember?) that _ this
year we have not had any of
the controversial issues which
sprang up last year—the Martin
Luther King episode, the IFC,
etc. We realize this is an unhealthy
sign and we have been beating the
bushes all semester to find juicy
controversies.

There is another matter we ought
to include. We have been unable
to find anyone to fill the shoes of
our illustrious ex-columnist Thorns
Craven (bless his soul!) Through

who were compelled to join the union as well as those who can be

arbitrarily denied membership.

7. Power to compel the employer to bargain exclusively with the ma-

jority union.

8. Absolute authority to deny union membership to workers employed
in the bargaining unit, on any grounds or for no reason at all.

9. The right, in some situations, to invade the privacy of workers, even
against their wishes. This deprives them of a legal right enjoyed by all

other members of society.

10. The right, in some situations, to compel employers to make
available for union use the private property of the employer.
11. The right to compel the employer to provide protection against any
physical violence on the part of workers who resist invasion of their

privacy.

12, Unions are immune from the payment of damages for personal
and property injuries inflicted on employers or others by union
members engaged in activities, such as strikes or picketing. And this
stands even in situations where such activities have been officially
authorized and directed by the union.

13. The right to strike for objectives wholly unrelated to any proper
subject of collective bargaining. This is in contrast to the severely limited
right of an employer to engage in a lockout.

14. The right in some situations, to examine an employer's books and

records—including those containing such confidential data as costs, profits

and prices.

15. And finally, the almost complete immunity of unions from any
liability, penalty, or restriction under State law under the doctrine

of Federal preemption.

In listing the special grants and immunities, I do it not to suggest
that all of them should necessarily be removed, but to illustrate just what

powers unions have.

I certainly do not feel that the public interest is served by the possession
of the monopolistic power by unions. I am convinced that it must be
limited and I intend to introduce legislation to restore a more reasonable
and workable balance in the Nation’s labor-management relationship.

The enactment of legislation which will protect the interests of
individual worker, labor, management, and the public will prepare
way for the conduct of free and fair collective bargaining without

need for Government meddling.

Kirkley Proposes
Suggestion Box

By JOHN KIRKLEY

Recently business organizations
have instituted a company suggestion
box system, according to the Wall
Street Journal. Any employee of
the firm is allowed to proffer his
ideas about ways in which the func-
tioning of the company can be im-
proved.

Some suggestions involve change
or minor alterations in products,
others the streamlining or variation
of labor-management relations,
others the installment of an ice-
water fountain or Coke machine in
a certain part of a plant.

Most suggestions accepted by the
company are followed by a mon-
etary reward to the employee with
the bright idea. Some underlings
have received thousands of dol-
lars for their ideas because they
have saved the company money
and time, cut down the cost of op-
erations or increased productivi-
ty. At the management level, re-
wards usually consist of a cita-
tion.

What a wonderful idea! This sug-
gestion box is a positive thing, un-
like the assimilation box, whereby
the humblest member of a complex
organization can contribute to the
overall functioning of the whole and
win a measure of pride in his com-
pany, the applause of his peers, and
the respect of his superiors.

All going concerns, including
families, churches, and particularly
Washington and Lee, should have
such a suggestion box. The oc-
casional, anonymous “The boss
should go to H---” notes would
be far outweighed by constructive
suggestions which could consider-
ably improve group functioning
and benefit all concerned.

Just as a start, here are a few
suggestions for consideration!

Washington and Lee needs a gen-
uine buyers Co-op. A Co-op is a
group of buyers or sellers who get

 

together to promote their own in-
terests. In a buyers Co-op, the great-
er portion of profits is distributed to
the buyers through discounts when
buying and periodic profit-sharing.
Such a Co-op would be profitable to
its organizers and would be a source
of savings to W&L students.

We should have a_tri-mester
system at W&L. Each term would
consist of approximately ten weeks
of classes, followed by one week
of exams and two weeks vacation,
As it is, the course of study at
W&L is broken up in the first se-
mester by the Christmas holidays
and in the second by Spring Holi-
days. Term papers and exams are
a holiday burden and destroy part
of the value of the change of va-
cation.

Washington and Lee needs a
Mory’s, but since we cannot have
one, perhaps a decent student owned
and operated restaurant-hangout
would do.

According to Oscar Handlin, quot-
ed in a past issue of this paper (No.
14), a grading system such as ours
is outmoded, restrictive, destructive.
Some have suggested a grading
system of three categories: failure,
passing, superior.

A final suggestion is that stu-
dents should be allowed to help
each other with their assignments.
Learning comes about through the
meeting of ideas—either in con-
fiict or agrement, The student-
student relationship can be more
complete and therefore more re-
warding than the student-teacher
relation in many cases; often
teachers do not have the time to
explain material carefully to stu-
dents, whereas other students
might be able to take the time.

Change is not necessarily prog-
ress; but through instituting change,
we can make the real conform more
closely to our conceptions of the
ideal.

Tankmen Blast Dominion
As Four Records Topple

In a successful bid for their fourth
win of the season the varsity swim-
ming team crushed Old Dominion
College 60-28 and set four pool rec-
ords in the process, as the meet
marked the last before the start of
exam week.

Records

Old Dominion failed to enter the
opening 400-yard medley relay event
but W&L promptly threw away the
seven point gift with a disqualifi-
cation. Sophomore John Wolfe
brightened the scoring picture, how-
ever, with a record-breaking 1:56.0
in the 200-yard freestyle with the
Generals’ number two man Walt
McManus a close second.

Freshman John Lifter immediately
added five more points with a rec-
ord in the 200-yard individual med-
ley as he was clocked in 2.108,
breaking Elliot Maynard's long-
standing record.

In the 200-yard butterfly event
another freshman, Bo Bokinsky, also

Trackmen Fall
In VMI Meet

A small remnant of the W&L
track team participated in a meet
at the VMI fieldhouse house Sat-
urday.

Due to complications resulting
from Fancy Dress, only a handfull of
runners were on hand for the meet
with Clemson, VMI, UNC, Duke,
Maryland, Furman and Tennessee.

Against this strong competition
the Generals were only able to gain
fifth place in two events.

Robin Kell grabbed a fifth in the
hop-step-jump, a very respectable
feat for him since his normal special-
ty is high-jump.

The trackmen also took a fifth
in the sprint-shuttle relay. Essex,
Pearson, Chris Kell and Meyers took
part in this event.

erased one of former captain May-
nard’s records in 2:18.1.

The final 400-yard freestyle re-
lay team of Monsarrat, Hart, Jahn-
cke, and Casto, finished the meet
with a record-breaking 2:23.9, one
tenth of a second under the former
record set last year.

Four Meet Remain

At the end of seven meets the
Generals’ record stands at 4-3. With
Georgetown, West Virginia, Mary-
land, and East Carolina remaining,
Coach Norris Eastman only com-
ments that the season’s end will tell
the tale. All four teams are strong
with Maryland the strongest.

Top Scorers

Individual scoring Freshman Bo
Bokinsky heads the list with 47
points, with Sophomore John Wolfe
close behind at 43, and Art Broadus
with 22.

Due to illness captain Herb Jahncke
will be unable to finish the season.
His loss will be felt greatly in the
coming weeks as the freestyle events
and the leadership of the team are
both forced to adapt to his absence.

Grapplers Stover
Winfield And Smith
Remain Undefeated |

Washington and Lee University’s
undefeated wrestling team goes
back into action after a two-week
exam break Saturday night against
Duke’s Blue Devils in Lexington.

The 8:30 p.m. Duke match is
the first bout on a tight W&L
schedule which sends Coach Dick
Miller’s grapplers against six op-
ponents in 14 days. As a further
complication, three of the Gener-
erals’ six foes—Franklin and Mar-
shall, West Virginia and Virginia—

boast top-notch teams this year.

After their Saturday encounter
with Duke, the Generals entertain
North Carolina State Monday night.
The match is set for 8:30 p.m.

Three Undefeated Men

The Generals, 4-0 so far, will send
three undefeated wrestlers—Tom
Stover, Pete Winfield and Herb
Smith—against Duke and North
Carolina State. Stover wrestles in
the 147-pound class, Winfield goes
at 157 and Smith is in the 177-pound
category.

Washington and Lee had little
trouble with Duke last year, posting
a 19-8 victory at Durham. Duke’s
lone wins came in the 130-pound
and 167-pound classes. This year,
the Blue Devils are suffering an off
year. In four meets Duke has won
only six of 32 bouts.

North Carolina State forced the
Generals to go all out for a win in
1962 and appear to be tough again
this year. The Generals did not
clinch a 16-14 triumph last year
until Smith pinned State’s Jack
Watson in the 177-pound class.
Don Athern and Bill Sullivan are
State’s top returnees. These two
plus four sophomores form the
Wolfpack nucleus.

Remaining Schedule
Feb. 9, Duke, home; Feb. 11, North
Carolina State, home; Feb. 16,
Franklin and Marshall, away; Feb.
19, Hampden-Sydney, home; Feb.
23, West Virginia, away; Feb. 25,
Virginia, home.

NOTICE
The varsity wrestling team will be
competing against North Carolina
State on Monday, February 11.

Professors
Awarded

Study Funds

A total of $6,020 in university
funds has been granted to 16 Wash-
ington and Lee faculty members for
support of their research and study
projects for 1963.

The awards, supported by the uni-
versity’s John M. Glenn Fund,
were announced Tuesday by Dr.
William W. Pusey, III, Dean of the
College. Individual grants-in-aid this
year range from $150 to $900.

The Glenn grants are a part of
a Washington and Lee program de-
signed to promote continuing facul-
ty scholarship and to increase teach-
ing effectiveness in the classrooms
and laboratories.

Established at Washington and Lee
in 1953, the program is supported
through a $120,000 gift from the late
John M. Glenn, who was an official
of the Russell Sage Foundation and
an 1879 graduate of Washington and
Lee. A $250,000 grant from the Car-
negie Foundation was used to pro-
mote faculty scholarship from 1961
until the start of the Glenn program.

Most of the professors receiving
grants will conduct their research
this summer, but they have until
Dec. 1 to complete their projects.

The 1963 recipients, their academic
departments and projects are:

Dr. W. G. Bean, history, for com-
pletion of a Diary of the Confed-
erate Hospital Steward, John Ap-
person, being edited for the Virginia
Historical Society, and for two arti-
cles on members of General Jack-
son’s staff and the “Occupation of
Lexington, July 1864.”

Charles P. Brockman, romance
languages, for completion of his

Faculty Grants
Class-Free Day
Before Exams

Washington and Lee's faculty
moved yesterday to ease the univer-
sity’s exam schedule by establish-
ing a day free of classes prior to
the opening of the next exam period.

The action was taken in faculty
meeting and will initially be in
effect for this semester only, ac-
cording to the announcement made
by Dean of the College William W.
Pusey this morning.

The proposal to lighten class
schedules just before exams was
made by the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
in an editorial November 13, 1962.
The faculty, however, has gone

 

In honor of Washington's Birth-
day no university classes or exer-
cises will be held on Friday, Feb-

farther than asked by scheduling no
classes at all on the day before
exams. Prior to this semester class-
es were held without respite up to
and including the day before the
testing periods began.

The Tuesday edition forwarded the
idea of easing into exam _ period
after the University of Virginia made
steps in that direction.

Dean Pusey said this morning,
“The faculty recognizes the burden
which the old exam schedule im-
posed. We feel that Washington and
Lee students have the maturity and
good sense to refrain from abusing
this attempt to alleviate the prob-
lem.”

Under the administration action,
Friday, May 24, will be completely
available to study.

Change Spurs
Race For Votes

The newly formed political parties
have already started throwing stones,
well over two months in advance of
campus elections.

Shortly after the formation last
Thursday of the new Progressive
Party, the remnant fraternities of
the old Independent and University
parties worked to get the publicity
jump on the opposition by forming
an all new “University Party.”

The result of their move was the
distribution Tuesday afternoon of
a “statement of reorganization,”
printed “in order to offer the Student
Body candidates who will continue
to display high qualities of leader-
ship and responsibility.”

About-Face

Doing what appears to be an
about-face for the old UP, the “re-
organized” party devoted most of its
sheet to cries of vested interests in
the new Progressive coalition.

Prime objects of the charges were
the Publications Board and particu-
larly the Ring-tum Phi.

Implications in the UP circulation
were ‘that their “statement” had
been forced to take the form of a
Protest-like leaflet because of con-
trol of both papers by the new party.

What they failed to mention was
that the party-reorganization init-
iated by the nine fraternities form-
ing the Progressive Party was not
officially completed until after press
time of last Friday’s paper.

Also omitted from the sheet were
the reasons for the reorganization,
which has been in the making by
the nine Progressive houses for some
time: a growing inequality and im-

‘Progressives’ Balance
Campus Party System

By STEVE SMITH

In a surprise move late Thursday night, nine of W&L’s
eighteen fraternities made,a significant step toward balancing
the two party system on campus with the formation of a new

The new combination, to be known as the Progressive

Party, is a coalition of five former University and four Indepen-
*dent Party houses.

Represented at the Thursday
night meeting in the PiKA House
were Delt, Kappa Sig, Phi Gam, Phi
Psi, PiKA, SAE, Sigma Nu, SPE, and
ZBT all of whom pledged their sup-
port to the new party in the upcom-
ing elections.

Tom Woodward, PiKA, was elected
first chairman of the new party.
Woodward said, “A great deal of
basic work was done and various
possibilities considered before the
Progressive Party became a reality.
By equalizing the political structure
at a nine-nine division, we hope to
establish a true two-party system.
Since to end the ‘spoils system’ is
an objective in our formation, the
Progressive Party plans to select its
candidates on the basis of merit.”

‘Seek Out Best Men’

Woodward continued, “Although
the Progressive Party is originally
made up of nine fraternities we hope
to recognize qualified non-fraternity
men in seeking out the best men for
office.”

Reports from the Wrecked Univer-
sity and Independent organizations
indicate that UP chairman Bill
Burke is already working to unite
the remnants of the old blocs. The
nine houses available to him will
merge, probably under the UP ban-
ner since the Independent Party
lost its chairman when Kappa Sigma
Steve Guild joined the Progressives.

Burke also made visits to the
which bolted the UP, in efforts to
the house regain the 10-8 majority
which the Big Clicque enjoyed for
years but his efforts have been un-
successful.

UP Domination

The UP first became a majority
party in 1956 when DU switched its
allegiance. It became a monopolistic
force in 1958 when Sigma Chi also
deserted the Independent Party,
giving the UP 16 of 18 class offices
and six of the Big Seven offices that
year. Last Spring, SPE joined the
UP ranks, leaving the Independent
Party in shambles and giving the
Big Clique a majority of the total
school votes.

If the party line-up remains at
nine University and nine Progressive
houses, the new party will own a
slight numerical advantage of the
fraternity men.

Red Square Split

A significant development in the
emergence of the Progressive Party
is the resulting split of the old Red
Square bloc. For decades the Red
Square houses—PiKA, Sigma Nu,

Dr. Colvin Heads Refugee Group Project

By WARREN FONTGOMERY

Dr. Milton Colvin heads up a
project aimed towards the resettle-
ment of a Cuban refugee family
in Rockbridge County.

Since the middle of January, this
project has been spensored by a
local steering committee under the
leadership of Colvin, W&L Political
Science Associate Professor. The
committee has had the support of
leading citizens of Lexington and
Rockbridge County, including Mayor
Paul A. Holstein and Mrs. Austin
Drumm, and its plans are now near-
ing completition.

The two principal problems facing

the steering committee are employ- |

ment and housing, the former being
the more difficult.

it has a high unemployment
rate. Consequently, any Cuban re-
settled in the county must be one

Though Rock- |

who, according to Dr. Colvin, “would
bring a skill badly needed into the
community and who would thus not
take a job away from a Rockbridge
County native.” It is primarily nee-
essary, then, to find a Cuban framily
head has some profesisonal skill in
such fields as architecture, engineer-
ing, laboratory technical work,
counting, or teaching.

An additional requirement for the
family is that it must be one that
would plan to remain a resident of
Rockbridge County until the present
Communist regime in Cuba can be
overthrown,

 

The steering committee is working

in conjunction with the Department
| of Health, Education, and Welfare,
which is in charge of the settlement
of refugees from Cuba in this coun-
| try. The transportation of a refugee
family to Lexington would be paid
by this department.

 

The Cuban Refugee Center in
Miami reports that over 150,000 refu-
gees have fled to Miami from Cuba
since 1959. The majority of these
people were in a destitute condition
on arrival due to the Castro policy
of confiscation of property and be-
longings of emigrants from his
country. But it is also true that many
of the exiles are of the former mid-
dle class and thus are possessed o!
skills and professional knowledge.

This large influx of refugees into
Miami has created an acute housing
and employment problem there, al-
though 45,000 of these displaced Cu-
bans have been resettled in towns
and cities throughout the nation.
Approximately 300 Cubans now live
in Virgiina .

If any reader should know of a
jub opening in Lexington or Rock-

bridge County, he should contact
either Dr. Colvin, Mayor Holstein,
or Mrs. Drumm.

Rumors And The Honor System

Executive Committee members are re-
portedly appalled by the irresponsible rumors
which flourish on campus following honor sys-
tem convictions. The facts of a case are in-
variably distorted beyond recognition, and are
often carried to preposterous extremes. And
yet many students not only believe the rumors,
but they feel no compunction about spreading
them further, adding a little more scandal
with each account. In a recent case, distortions
became so rampant that the EC, for the pro-
tection of the Honor System, was forced to
reveal the facts of the case, an action which
was inconsistent with the EC’s policy of pro-
tecting a convicted student in every possible
way.

No one is more aware of the implications
of an Honor System conviction than an Ex-
ecutive Committeeman. A miscarriage of jus-
tice by the EC could inexcusably wreck a
student’s life and, further, a mistake could
wreck the Honor System, the very system
which the EC has sworn to maintain. It should
be apparent to any level-headed observer that
the EC cannot afford to make such a mistake,

and that, for this reason, a student accused

of an alleged violation is given the benefit
of every possible doubt.

Absurd rumors are not only an insult to
the intelligence of the members of the EC,
but they are also detrimental to the Honor
System itself. They create an image of twelve
ogres conducting an inquisition, and under-
mine the student body’s confidence in the
Executive Committee and in the Honor Sys-
tem itself.

Rumors such as these arise purely and
simply out of ignorance. This situation could
be alleviated if the student body would take
more than an occasional interest in the tech-
nicalities of the Honor System, and if students
who have questions about the Honor System
procedure would take time to talk to EC rep-
resentatives. The Executive Committee would
welcome such interest, for many misconcep-
tions could be resolved, and the EC itself
would profit by the airing of new ideas and
viewpoints.

The members of the Executive Committee
are elected by the student body to uphold
the student body’s Honor System. They de-
serve and have a right to expect the student
body’s interest and trust.

 

The Cut System

The survey of other schools’ absence regu-
lations as they compare with that of W&L’s
(see article, this page) brings out several in-
teresting points.

First of all, we aren’t as bad off as we
thought we were. While our system does com-
pare in degree with the most stringent of those
mentioned, it is not the only one of its kind
in existence. A number of other schools, com-
parable to Washington and Lee in academic
standing, have maintained regulations as
austere as—and in at least one case—more
austere than W&L’s.

Out of necessity, then, we must throw out
the claim that “all good schools have liberal
cut regulations.” They don’t, and it’s as simple
as that. We should be glad, perhaps, that our
system is not more stringent than it is.

Secondly, it appears that at most schools
where liberal or free cut systems have been
instituted, authority to formulate and enforce
regulations has been relegated to individual in-
structors. The presupposition here seems to
be that teachers themselves can most object-
ively evaluate how often class attendance is

necessary for a student’s getting the most
benefit from a particular course.

Whether or not this is true remains to be
seen. As far as we could find out, however,
the “individual instructor” regulations seem to
work very well. In most instances, professors
were quite liberal and lenient in requiring
class attendance.

At Washington and Lee, however, we won-
der whether or not such a system would be
feasible; for, by implication, such a system
places an immense amount of academic re-
sponsibility on classroom teachers. They must
not only be objective and fair in the analysis
of their courses, but they must (ideally) seek
to inculcate real intellectual stimulation in the
classroom situation.

We understand that this idea of individual
teachers’ governing cut regulations has been
proposed, and has been consistently vetoed by
the faculty here—along with every other pro-
posal for a liberalized cut system.

We certainly would not conclude from this
that our instructors do not have confidence

Washington And Lee Skeptics:
In Quest of a ‘University Ideal’?

By BILL LOWRY

Most of the ado about the number
of students, especially freshmen,
planning to transfer out of Washing-
ton and Lee has died down, as hap-
pens every year when the rumors are
caught up with by the actual facts;
one can, of course, look forward to
the spring when, if the past is any
indication, the same questions will
be raised again.

However, the recent discussions
raise some interesting questions
about the nature of Washington and
Lee as an educational institution,
and it is to these questions that I
propose we address ourselves, with
the aim of learning from past mis-
takes and experiences.

Justification for W&L

For many students, Washington
and Lee needs no justification—the
school as it stands is ideal with
any change or proposed change
being an unwanted disruption of the
status quo. Fortunately the number
of such students, although still a
large majority is becoming less each
year. For others however whose
number seems to be_ increasing,
questioning begins with arrival at
Freshman Camp and_ continues
throughout their stay at W&L, how-
ever long that stay may be.
Traditions ‘Glittering Generalities’

Seeing such aspects as con-
ventional dress and the speaking tra-
dition as the glittering generalities
they are, finding little appeal in the
ante-bellum ideal of a gentleman

 

which, as often as not, has less to
do with a man’s character than with
his public image, and even question-
ing that most hallowed of all Sacred
Cows, the Honor System, such stu-
dents have grave doubts about the
real value of a Washington and Lee
education. Answers to the questions
raised by these students generally
have little or no appeal, being based,
as they are, on premises which the
creative or maverick student has al-
ready rejected.

In past years, the response to the
problem of the skeptical student
has taken, roughly, one of two lines:
either the “Washington and Lee is
the way it is—if you don’t like it you
can leave” position; or the “a good
student can get whatever he wants
out of Washington and Lee— all
it takes is a little individual ini-
tiative” approach.

The unusual student, realizing that
he can go to schools where more
emphasis is placed on his own needs,
both as a student and as a person,
and realizing that there are more
important things to spend $10,000 on
than the privilege of wearing a coat
and tie, frequently takes the first
attitude seriously, and transfers else-
where, depriving Washington and
Lee of the insights such students
might provide.

To be sure, there are many ad-
vantages of a Washington and Lee
education, but how many of these,
with the possible exception of the
cult of the “Southern Gentleman”

 

(which has little appeal to the grow-
ing numbers of non-southern stu-
dents), cannot be realized else-
where? Certainly there are several
schools which provide small classes,
opportunities for close student-facul-
ty relations, a sound liberal arts
curriculum, often to a greater de-
gree than Washington and Lee.
Extra-Curriculars

There are, furthermore, many
meaningful forms of extracurricular
activities, but this is not unique with
W&L; and with the exception of
the social activities, often revealed in
their cruder aspects, such extra-
curricular opportunities as discussion
groups and community and _ social
service are given little emphasis.

Furthermore, the lack of a “school
spirit,” embracing and_ reconciling
all of the divergent elements of the
campus community is, with the ex-
ception of the rather notorious ex-
amples of a few alumni, almost
totally lacking, especially when one
compares Washington and Lee with
such schools as Princeton and Yale,
noted for their school spirit; this is
made evident, for example, by pass-
ing out of the Alma Mater on mime-
ographed sheets during University
Assemblies, because no one really
cares about learning the song.

No Symbol for the University

In fact, it is difficult to think of
any symbol which might represent
Washington and Lee to all of its
students; instead of thinking of the

Laudable Or Lamentable?

 

Reviewer Pace Ferrets Out Obscurities
Of ‘Last Year at Marienbad’ Movie

By TOM PACE

One film has recently had a rash
of controversial remarks hurled
upon it. “Last Year at Mariendad”
has been alternately praised as the
finest movie of all time (Penelope
Houston, Sight and Sound) and de-
nounced, by some, as the worst ever
made. Many students of sound mind
and generally respectable opinions
thought it terrible.

Why the Praise?

They deemed it a boring, dull,
psuedo-intellectual film made for
boring, dull, pseudo-intellectuals
who refuse to admit they not only
cannot understand it, but also do not
really enjoy it. If this is true, then
Miss Houston and nearly every other
major film critic would be declaimed
as a fraud. I doubt that they are.
Accordingly, I shall attempt to ex-

 

plain why ‘“Marienbad” has been
praised.
Something New

Alain Resnais is one of the few di-
rectors with a combination of talent
and imagination. What he under-
took in “Marienbad” was to create
that which had not been done be-
fore. He began with a script by Alain
Robbe-Grillet: it was purposeful,
used fine language, and was quite
suitable for Resnais’ plan. Primarily,
it told the story of a man who is
trying to convince a woman that
they had met the year before and
that she had agreed to leave with
him just one year later.

Two Objectives
Resnais, using this screenplay,
wished to do two things. He wanted
to show the thought and reactions
of his characters on the screen.

 

Therefore, while you read or listen
to the narrative, what you see are
the thoughts of the man and the
woman. There is a scene in which
she is killed. She is not actually
shot. Rather, her mind is playing
with the idea of what might happen
if what the may says is true. For
this reason she imagines herself
dying in three different positions.

Certainly this represents her
mind’s reaction to what he is saying.
To confuse matters, Resnais has
mingled the woman’s thoughts with
the man’s, and puts them in what
appears an illogical order. In addi-
tion, he has also mixed actual events
of the last year and the present with
their thoughts. Yet confusion here is
not a fault.

His reason for this is to imply the

A SURVEY OF OTHER SCHOOLS

 

The Cut System At W and

By BILL ATWELL
Now that Washington and Lee
has seemingly groped its way back

to normal (after the chaotic in- for which

own. At Davidson, “the maximum
number of absences which may be
incurred by a student in a course
he receives academic

lenient” there than Washington and
Lee’s.

As an added note, Amherst has
the same regulations as W&L in

terim of exams and Fancy Dress),
perhaps we can again take up the
unfinished business of attendance
regulations .

Earlier in the year John Kirk-
ley’s petition for cut reformation
was the object of considerable
comment, favorable and unfavor-
able, from students and faculty
alike.

Because of the interest this
petition engendered, it was de-
cided to compare our present sys-
tem with those of other schools.

A survey was made of various
institutions and this article is the
end result of that survey.

The schools contacted in the
course of the investigation may
be divided into two groups. The
first group ineludes the smaller
schools with which Washington and
Lee is most often compared. These
are Davidson, the University of
the South at Sewanee, Williams,
and Amherst.

The second group is comprised
of three of the leading larger uni-
versities in the country: Yale,
Princeton, and our neighbor to the
north, the University of Virginia.

In the course of our study the
seven schools were asked to sup-
ply us with their attendance regu-
lations and to comment on the suc-
cess or failure of their respective
systems.

Let’s now take a look at each
of the schools individually.

Davidson
Davidson’s regulations are con-
siderably more liberal than our

credit is limited to 25 per cent of
the scheduled meetings of the
class.” This would be equivalent to
12 cuts per class at W&L.

Davidson’s Dean of Students
wrote, “A growing dissatisfaction
with our prior regulations led to
the rather thorough revision under
which we are operating this year
for the first time. We intend to
evaluate this system and its oper-
ation toward the end of the aca-
demic year. Because of the new-
ness of the system it is impossible
to give a thoroughly sound evalua-
tion of it at this time. It is my off-
hand observation, however, that
the system is working very well.”

Amherst

The Amherst student handbook
reads “At the beginning of the
semester each instructor will state
his policy with regard to absences,
and thereafter, he will report to
the Registrar's office the name of
any student who violates the regu-
lations which the instructor has
set up for his own course. In such
cases the Dean will take appro-
priate action which may include
a reduction in his credit hours or
he may be dropped from the
course.”

First semester freshmen at Am-
herst, however, are allowed no un-

excused absences whatsoever,
either from class or laboratory
periods.

According to an Amherst stu-
dent interviewed by this reporter,
the individual professors’ regu-
lations are “considerably more

regard to absences before and after

vacations. Dean List students only

may be absent at those times.
University of Virginia

From the University of Virginia
Registrar E. W. Lautenschlarger
writes, “There are no hard and
fast absence regulations in the
undergraduate school with students
allowed a specific number of ‘cuts.’
The most basic requirement is that
a student attend at least 50 per
cent of his classes. However, this
is again only a basic requirement.
The matter of class absence is left
to the diseretion of both the in-
structors and the Dean.”

A personal friend of this reporter
said that he was accustomed to 10
or 12 cuts per class per semester
without any disciplinary action
being taken.

It is then easily seen that Vir-
ginia is much more liberal as con-
cerns absence regulations than is
W&L.

Yale's Regulations

Yale’s absence regulations are
also left up to the individual in-
structor. Since we were unable to
obtain first-hand information on
Yale’s system, it can only be as-
sumed that the instructors there
would be lenient in most instances.

In view of the situations at
other schools in which instructors
are responsible, this assumption
cannot be considered too unfound-
ed.

At Yale, however, “in courses
taught as discussion groups, semi-
nars, or in the laboratory, and also

L: How Does It Compare?

foreign language courses, where
the active participation of the stu-
dent is required, the instructor
may require attendance of all stu-
dents.”

Princeton

Princeton's assistant dean of stu-
dents wrote, “Princeton under-
graduates are expected to attend
all of their scheduled University
exercises; however, we do not have
any central recording of class cuts.
In other words, attendance control
is left primarily in the hands of
each instructor.”

Unofficial student reports from
Princeton indicate that the instruc-
tors are “indeed, very liberal” in
their allowance of cuts.

University of the South

The University of the South at
Sewanee allows a student unex-
cused absences in each course
equivalent to the number of se-
mester hours’ credit granted by
that course, plus one. Thus, in a
three-hour course, a student may
take four unexcused absences.

Members of the Order of Gowns-
men (an honor group of students
who have passed regulations set
up by the faculty and who act as
the equivalent of our Student Con-
trol Committee) are exempted from
the above regulations and no rec-
ord is kept of their cuts.

Gownsmen, however, may be re-
quired to attend classes in elemen-
tary language courses and in cer-
tain other departments, “on the
same basis as non-Gownsmen, or
according to a formula which is
less austere.”

Williams

After the first term, Williams

students are allowed a “total num-

ber of absences in accordance with
grades of the previous term using
the following schedule: A or B, five
absences; C, three absences; D, two
absences; E, one absence. If a new
course is substituted for the sec-
ond term of another, the same
procedure holds.” This system ap-
plies to students with below an
over-all B average.

Dean's List students at Williams
follow the same system as those
at W&L. No limit is placed on
their absence taking.

An Analysis of the Survey

The next question to be asked
is what conclusions may be drawn
from the survey.

Generally speaking, Davidson,
Amherst, Princeton, Yale and the
University of Virginia are more
liberal in their absence regulations
than Washington and Lee. Se-
wanee and Williams operate under
systems very closely resembling
our own.

However, and this might be a
blow to those who advocate un-
limited cuts for everyone, even the
five liberal schools will not tolerate
the abuse of absence privileges.

Instructors Determine Rules

Students are expected to abide
by the instructors’ regulations (at
Davidson by school-wide stand-
ards) and every student who vio-
lates those regulations may suffer
the consequences of being dropped
from the course, losing credits, or
being placed on various types of
cut probation.

At Washington and Lee...

What about the
Washington and Lee?

situation at

The problem here is not a unique
one. Davidson went through a per-
iod of criticism and dissatisfaction
much like ours a year ago. The
Davidson faculty decided to see
what would be the result of liber-
alization and the dean there made
the off-hand observation that “the
new system is working very well.”

What would be the result of a
liberalized cut system at Wash-
ington and Lee? Firstly, a new
system would be abused for, as
Kant said, “It is so comfortable
to be immature.” The immaturity
of a W&L student would be mani-
fested in that abuse.

Washington and Lee, however, is
not the same as it was in 1950 or
even in 1962. With each new class
the concern for education grows
stronger. With that concern is a
sense of responsibility almost non-
existent, so I'm told, a very few
years ago.

Unlimiteds ‘Unrealistic’

While unlimited cuts for every-
body is unrealistic, as well as be-
ing impractical, it is time for the
faculty to take a long hard look
at our system.

The regulations which govern
first semester freshmen and_ all
students with below 1.0 averages
are nothing short of ridiculous, in
this reporter's opinion. The regu-
lations for students with a 1.0
are tolerable but in need of re-
vision.

As has been said, if the system
is liberalized, there will at first be
abuse. The only person harmed by
that abuse, however, will be the
immature student involved—and
he can’t be wet-nursed indefinitely.

Duke, Fall To State

Wé&L’s junior varsity wrestling team scored an even split
in two weekend matches with Duke and North Carolina State
of the Atlantic Coast Conference.

The JV’s whipped Duke, 16-14, and* —-——

fell to N. C. State, 21-13.

Jim Burton, Carson Carlisle, and
Tom Ware scored wins in the losing
effort against the Wolfpack.

Burton Pins

Burton pinned Arthur Price in
2:47, after taking a 4-2 lead. Car-
lisle won on a forfeit, and Ware de-
cisioned Phil Howard, 10-1.

The Baby Generals came close to
winning both matches as they drop-
ped a 2-0 and a 3-0 decision to N.
C. State. State’s Tony Warner whip-
ped Bill Wilson, 2-0, on an escape
and riding time; and State’s Wendell
Leonard topped Jamie Andrew, 3-0,
on a reversal and irding time.

A pair of pins by Tom Ware and
Jim Burton paced the Washington
and Lee junior varsity wrestlers to
a 16-14 triumph over Duke’s fresh-
men.

Burton, wrestling at 123, scored a
fall over Duke’s Mike Boehm at
3:45.

Wilson Wins

Bill Wilson boosted the baby Gen-
erals into a 8-0 lead with a 9-4 de-
cision over Sam Walker in the 130-
pound weight class. Trailing, 3-4,
at the end of the first period, Wil-
son scored four points in the sec-
ond stanza on a reverse and a pen-
alty to take the lead for keeps.

Ware, wrestling at 177, sewed up
the match for W&L by pinning Doug
Lyons at 6:48. Ware held a 12-5
point lead at the time.

Near Pins
After taking a 2-0 lead in the first
period, Ware really had a _ battle

 

royal. Twice in the second frame he
scored near pins and once was
nearly pinned himself.

The other JV win was turned in
by Jamie Andrew at 157, Andrew
whipped Jim Moreng, 8-6. Andrew
led all the way, but had to stall. off
a late drive by Moreng.

in the second half and withstood a
late W&L rally for the win.
Tigers Take Lead

Although the shooting percent-
ages from the floor, 42.0, were equal,
the Tigers went ahead to stay with
2:09 left in the first half when two
free throws by star Bill Hardin made
the score 44-42 in Hampden-Syd-
ney’s favor.

From there the Tigers built up a
51-45 halftime edge.

Fauber Stars

W&L, paced by superstar Rodger
Fauber and Tom Supak, narrowed
the Tiger margin to 85-82 with 2:00
left in the game.

The Generals, however, missed two
shots that would have cut the mar-
gin to one point. Then they were
forced to foul the Tigers to get the
ball.

Wrestlers Roll By Duke, N. C. State

Washington and Le’s undefeated
wrestling team rolled to its sixth
straight victory Monday night, pol-
ishing off a tough North Carolina
State squad, 19-9.

The victory coupled with a 27-5
pasting of Duke Saturday raised
W&L’s record to 6-0 and 3-0 against
Atlantic Coast Conference oppon-
ents. The only other ACC team on
the Generals’ schedule is Virginia.
The Wahoos, who sport one of the
ACC’s clubs this year, will in-
vade Doremus Gymnasium, Mon-
day, February 25.

F&M Next

The Generals next foe is perennial
power Franklin and Marshall Satur-
day at F&M. Their next home foe is
Hampden-Sydney on February 19.

Tri-captain Dave Montgomery and
undefeated Tom Stover thrilled a
crowd of about 450 fans with pins
against N. C. State.

Montgomery with an 11-1 margin
late in the third period pinned Dave
Jones with only one second to go
in the match.

 

Stover Shines

Stover finished off Fred Cook, who
held a 4-2-1 record going into the
match, in 20 seconds of the second
period. Stover held a 5-0 lead at
that point.

Stover along with Pete Winfield
have 6-0 records.

Butch West at 123 decisioned Rick
Ray, 10-6, in one of his best efforts
of the year.

Freshman Kem White wrestled
State captain Steve Barnes (8-1) a
good match at 137, before bowing,
5-0.

Dick Albert brought his season
record to 4-2 with a 6-1 decision

serves Frank Booth and Allen Black-
burn kept the Tigers’ lead safe.
‘Best Game’

“This was by far our best offen-
sive game,” said coach Bob McHenry.

Fauber paced both the W&L scor-
ing and rebounding with 20 points
and ten rebounds. Supak scored 16
points; Bret Thackston, 14; Louie
Paterno, 13; and Don Wallis, 12.

W&L put four different men, Bill
Smith, Wallis, Fauber, and Paterno,
on H-S’s Hardin during the game,
but the star still managed a whop-
ping 29 points.

Spring Football ‘Practice

Gets Underway Tomorrow
In Usual Bad Weather

Washington and Lee University’s
football squad may be getting the
jump on some colleges by starting
spring practice Wednesday but
Coach Lee McLaughlin doesn’t think
his players will have much of a
head start on the weather.

For three years running now,
W&L’s spring practice has been
plagued by snow and mud and the
weatherman does not give much
hope for a change this year. The
Generals will practice about an
hour and a half daily until March
2 when the annual alumni-varsity
game will be staged.

Coach McLaughlin expects about
60 players—25 to 30 of them fresh-
men—on hand for Wednesday’s ini-
tial session. He will be without the
services of eight seniors plus about
three other members of W&L’s 8-1-0
1962 team, Two fourth stringers ex-
perienced academic difficulties first
semester and a third-string junior
says he won't play next season.

The Generals will only get 13
days of actual practice since George
Washington’s birthday on February
22 is a university holiday and coach-
es plan to call off workouts the 21st,
22nd, and 24th.

Work on Fundamentals
“We'll work on fundamentals dur-
ing most of the practice time,” Mc-
Laughlin observed. “After all, the
most valuable part of any spring
practice is the opportunity to look

 

 

at our new men and see just how
improved our experienced players
are.”

disposing of Duke, running up a
19-0 lead before the Blue Devils
managed to score.

Sophomores Tom Stover and Pete
Winfield, two of the Generals’ un-
defeated wrestling trio, scored quick
pins.

Stover, wrestling at 147, needed
only 4:17 to pin Jeff Lee. The
quick star almost pinned Lee on
his initial takedown, and rolled up
a 8-0 point lead before he put Lee
away for keeps.

Winfield, moved up to 177 in place
of Herb Smith, required only 14
more seconds than Stover to pin
Duke’s Warren Seagraves. His pin
came at 4:31. Winfield had amassed
a 7-0 point lead before he scored the
pin.

At 123, Butch West easily dis-
posed of Randy Meyers, 7-0. West
took a quick 4-0 lead in the first
period on a take down and a near
fall, and coasted from there on.

Tri-Captain Dave Montgomery
topped James Bierfield, 9-5 ,in the
130-pound weight class and Dan
Reeves won on a forfeit at 137.

In one of the night's closest
matches, tri-captain Dick Albert

bert picked up two points for a
take down in the first period and
added another point for an escape
in the second period. Politi’s point

‘Jumbo’: A Bad One

I recently, unwittingly, sat
through nearly twohours of “Jum-
bo.” It is a musical starring Doris
Day, Stephen Boyd, Jimmy Durante,
and Martha Raye. It has a few good
songs, and even fewer good scenes.
I, the viewer, should have known
not to view it. They, the producers,
should have known not to produce
it. The film is featured at the State
Theatre for the remainder of the
week.

Beginning next week at the State
is “Taras Bulba.” It deserves little
comment. It doubtlessly received
more bad reviews than any other
film this past year.

Thursday, Alfred Hitchcock’s
“Rear Window,” with James Stew-
art and Grace Kelley, comes to the
Lyric. Directed by one of Amer-
ica’s best, and filled with fine per-
formances, it is a film good for
two hours of superb entertainment.

“Waltz of the Torreadors” follows.
It starts Sunday. I have not seen
it, but Peter Sellers stars, and it
may be very worthwhile. The play
was a great success, displaying ex-
tremely sharp and cynical comedy.

'UCA Meets

For Discussion

The University Christian Asso-
ciation has recently moved into the
field of diplomacy.

In an effort to boost W&L’s re-
lationship with neighboring women’s
colleges, the UCA has begun to
sponsor a series of roundtable dis-
cussions with Hollins,
and Randolph-Macon Women’s Col-
lege.

The program originated in the fall
of 1961 when a group of sophomores
end juniors, under the auspices of
the UCA, held a joint discussion with
representatives from Hollins.
discussion led a series of W&L-
Hollins meetings which were held
periodically during the year, with
the two colleges alternating as host.

Due to the success of these meet-
ings, the UCA has extended this
program this year to Randolph-Ma-
con and Sweet Briar. The topies of
discussion have ranged from theology
to current issues.

Ashley Wiltshire, president of the

| UCA, commented that the meetings

have contributed a great deal to-
ward a_ better understanding be-
tween W&L and the girls’ colleges.
He added that he would be glad to
see any students interested in join-
ing these discussion groups.

NOTICE

The Washington Literary Society
will sponsor a lecture by Dr. S. P.
C. Duvall on Tuesday, February 19
at 7:30 p.m. in the Student Union.
Dr. Duvall will speak on Herman
Melville’ s Billy Budd.

arship fund, a fund established in
honor of the Washington and Lee
alumni who gave their lives in World
War II.

Young remarked, the
represented an effort to

also help relieve the seasonal lull
in entertainment,” Young added.

Charlie Byrd, who will appear with
his accompanists, the Village Van-
guard, plays for the Showboat
Lounge in Washington, D.C. In ad-
dition to his nightclub entertainment,
he has recorded six popular albums,
including Jazz at the Showboat,
Byrd in the Wind, and Charlie Byrd
at the Village Vanguard.

His recordings range from the
Spanish-rhythm Scherzo for an Old
Shoe to the classical sonato, Polo-
naise Pour Pietro. Supporting Byrd
are Keter Betts, bass; Buddy Dep-
penschnidt, Drum; and Bill Sum-
mers at the piano.

Byrd, a one-time student of An-
dres Segovia, has been applaud-
ed as today’s most perfected and
versatile guitarist. Playing the finger
style without the use of a pick, he
is especially praised for his success
at blending jazz and classical tech-
niques.

Max Gordon joins other critics in
a high estimation of Byrd’s skills.
He is particularly impressed by
Byrd’s “undefeated but firm ability
to command an audience’s attention.”
The improvement, he states, which
Byrd has made during his playing
| career “must be chalked up to prog-
ress—artistic progress.”

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi
Friday Edition
Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

 

Campus

We are pleased to see the realignment of political parties
which has been announced. This adjustment has created two
parties which are fairly matched, and the result will be, hope-
fully, a stronger student government at Washington and Lee.

Without summarizing the details of the new party system
which have been given, we have several comments to make

concerning its possible effect.

Most obviously, this is something which has been needed
for a long time. The situation came to a head when Sigma Phi
Epsilon switched late last spring to the old University party,
leaving an intolerable over-balance in favor of that party. The
effect of this nine-nine balance of fraternities will be closer elec-
tions in all offices and a better chance of victory for most can-

didates.

It is also noteworthy that this shuffling of houses could not
be labeled as one big party “‘switch.’’Rather, two entirely new
political parties have been formed, and this alignment is based
neither on old relationships nor mere geographical location.
Two houses in Red Square are members of one party, while
the remaining three houses are in the other.

The test of spring elections remains, and from now until
that time, both new parties will bear a great responsibility. They
must organize, and party leaders should be selected promptly.
There will be many unfamiliar new political relationships which
will need smooth adjustment. We can be assured of well-run
elections in the spring along with the best possible candidates
from both parties before the student body only if planning for

all of this is begun now.

that we attend a School with two

5th would be Founders Day (right
in the middle of spring vacation),
since Elihu Yale was born then.

At Cornell we would get January
8th—Ezra Cornell's  birthday—but
that is right after Christmas vaca-
tion. This is during term paper
week and not an opportune time
to take vacations.

At Franklin and Marshall, Janu-
ary 17th and September 24th would
be holidays. This set-up is far bet-
ter than ours, but not ideal. A hy-
pothetical perfect situation would
exist if you went to a_ college
founded by Phineas Taylor Barnum
(of Circus fame) and John Paul
Jones (of nautical fame), and, in
addition, if you were going to sum-
mer school at this imaginary Barnum
and Jones University. Their birth-
days are July 5th and 6th respec-
tively. With July 4th a holiday for
all, you could take off for a three-
day bash.

Well, we must admit that this is
ridiculous, since neither Barnum
or Jones ever thought of founding
a college. But we can dream, can’t
we?

The best situation we could
hope for here would be if Emma
Hart Willard had by some quirk
of fate help found the college
instead of Robert E. Lee. Her
birthday falls on the 23rd of Feb-
uary—one day after George's,
and the next day being Sunday,
we could have beaten it out of
here for three days. But, we can’t
quite see the Washington and
Willard Swing. And anyway, Mrs.
Willard founded a girl's school in
Troy, New York named, strangely
enough—Emma Willard.

All in all we have one day—Feb-
ruary 22—and we wish everybody
luck with their vacation plans. Some
are going north to ski, others, south
for the sun, but if you aren’t that
ambitious or don’t have cuts at
least go to B-V for a flick next
Friday.

Speaking of flicks Rear Window is
in town now and shouldn’t be missed
by anyone who enjoys a good Al-

 

fred Hitchcock thriller.

Lewis F. Powell Fifth Alumnus
Named To Presidency Of A.B.A.

When Richmond attorney Lewis F.
Powell, Jr., steps up to the presi-
dency of the American Bar Associa-
tion in August of 1964 he will be
the fifth Washington and Lee Uni-
versity alumnus to hold the post.

A member of the university’s
Board of Trustees since 1961, Powell
was selected as president-elect des-
ignate of the ABA during the group’s
mid-year meeting last week in New
Orleans. Powell, 55, will succeed
Walter E. Craig of Phoenix, Ariz.,
the current president-elect. He will
be the 88th president of the national
legal group that was organized in
1878 and has over 102,000 members.

Only two law schools in the
nation have had more graduates
elected to the top ABA job than
Washington and Lee, according to
statistics compiled by the asso-
ciation’s central office in Chicago.
Ten graduates of Harvard Univer-
sity’s law school have held the
post and six Columbia University
alumni have served as ABA presi-
dents. Washington and Lee’s near-
est contender, the University of
Pennsylvania, has three.

The first Washington and Lee
alumnus to become president of the
ABA was Henry St. George Tucker,
who guided the association in 1904-
05. He was the dean of Washington
and Lee’s School of Law from 1899
to 1902. Dean Tucker succeeded
his father, John Randolph Tucker,
as dean of the Lexington law school.
The elder Dean Tucker was presi-
dent of the ABA in 1892-93. Al-
though he was a graduate of the
University of Virginia, Washington
and Lee informally claims him as
a “W&L man” since he was its first
law dean.

Other Washington and Lee grad-
uates to hold the ABA presidency
and their dates of office are John
W. Davis, 1922-23; Scott M. Lof-
tin, 1934-35; and Ross L. Malone,
1958-59.

Since Washington and Lee has a
relatively small law school, univer-
sity officials take special pride in
the number of law graduates who
have headed the ABA. This Sep-
tember, 142 students registered for
law and 55 of those were entering
for the first time. The new students
this year represented 35 colleges
and 18 states and Canada. There are

nine men on the Washington and
Lee law faculty.

“My feeling was one of great pride
when I learned of the selection of
one of our distinguished law gradu-
ates—Mr. Lewis F. Powell—as pres-
ident-elect designate of the Amer-
ican Bar Association,’ Law School
Dean Charles P. Light said.

“Our School of Law, one of the
smaller ones, has been similarly
honored in earlier years by the elec-
tion to the presidency of the ABA

 

ihn

Ross L. Maline

of four of its graduates and its first
dean,” Dean Light added. “This is
quite a notable record. Many of our
graduates also have served the bar
associations of their respective states
with great distinction.”

The current president of the Vir-
ginia Bar Association, Waldo G.
Miles of Bristol, is a 1938 law gradu-
ate of Washington and Lee. Miles
was named to the Virginia Board of
Education in January by Governer
Albertis Harrison.

John R. Tucker, who was 15th
president of the association, serv-
ed as Washington and Lee’s law
dean from 1870 to 1899. When the
original law school building burn-
ed in 1934 and the present three-
story edifice was built to replace
it, university officials decided to
re-name the building Tucker Hall

 

in honor of Dean Tucker's service.

 

 

Like his son, he also served in

Congress.

Henry St. George Tucker was the
27th ABA president. He died in
1932 after having served as law dean
at Washington and Lee and Colum-
bia (now George Washington Uni-
versity), seven terms in Congress
and president of the Jamestown
Exposition Co. He was dean of the
School of Law and Diplomacy at
George Washington when he was
elected ABA president. He received

Lewis F. Powell

his LL.B. from Washington and Lee
in 1876.

It was 17 years after the younger
Tucker was ABA president when
another Washington and Lee alum-
nus took the helm of the organiza-
tion, In 1922, John W. Davis, the
1924 Democratic nominee for pres-
ident, stepped up to the post as
the 45th president. Davis, who
died in 1955, was a member of the
62nd and 63rd Congresses, Solici-
tor-General of the U.S. for five
years and U.S. Ambassador to
Great Britain for three years, He
received his B.A. degree from
Washington and Lee in 1892 and
his LL.B. in 1895. When the uni-
versity opened its dormitory for
law students in 1959, it was named
in horor of Davis who had been a
trustee and the university Rector.

 

 

In the mid-1930’s, Jacksonville at-

torney Scott M. Loftin was appointed
to fill the unexpired term of Florida
Senator Park Trammell who died
unexpectedly. Senator Loftin, who

attended Washington and Lee in
1898 and 1899 and received an
honorary LL.D. degree from his

Alma Mater in 1934, served in the
U.S. Senate for five months. He was
the 58th president of the ABA in
1934-35, a year before his Senate
appointment. He died in 1953.

When Ross L. Malone of Rose-
well, New Mexico, was elected
82nd ABA president in 1958 he was
the youngest man to be named to
the office in 80 years. His Alma
Mater honored him with an hon-
orary LL.D. degree that year and
students elected him a member of
the Washington and Lee chapter of
Omicron Delta Kappa. He is a
partner in the Rosewell firm of
Atwood and Malone and a fellow
of the American College of Trial
Lawyers. He received his Bachelor
of Laws degree from Washington
and Lee in 1932.

According to a mid-week national
news story on Powell, the word
“enthusiastic” comes up quite fre-
quently in conversations with the
Richmond attorney. This might well
be a key word for the soft-spoken
man whose activities range from
coaching a Little League baseball
team in Richmond to dealing with
major corporate and educational
problems throughout Virginia. Be-
sides being a trustee of Washing-
ton and Lee, he is a member of the
board of trustees of Hollins College
and the Virginia Board of Educa-
tion,

President-elect designate Pow-
ell is a senior member of the firm
of Hunton, Williams, Gay, Powell
& Gibson and has practiced law
in Richmond for over 30 years. In
1960, Washington and Lee awarded
him an honorary LL.D. degree. He
earned both his B.S. and LLB.
degrees from the university and
an LL.M. degree from Harvard
University. Hampden-Sydney Col-
lege gave Powell a LL.D. degree
in 1959.

As president of the American Bar
Association, Powell will have to take
time from his busy law practice
and associations with a number of

Physical Fitness Strikes Out Louis Macferb

By SANDY FENN
Friday Columnist

Louis Macferb was a normal, mal-
adjusted member of the Washington
and Lee Student body, and until
recently, he was very happy in this
unenlightened state of existence. He
was. short and
plump and rather
pear-shaped, but
in spite of this, he
never had any
trouble finding
short, plump pear-
shaped dates from
the nearby girls’
schools. Louis was
getting along quite
well until Mr.
Kennedy's pro-
gram of physical

 

fitness began to sweep the country.

One day Louis raised his head
from a pitcher of brew at Doc’s, blew
the cigarette smoke from his lungs
in a wheezing, broken stream, and
realized that he no longer repre-
sented the mainstream of American
youth. To Louis’ astonishment and
horror the whole country was caught
up in a fad of physical fitness. No
longer could the critics talk in
sneering tones about the “soft un-
derbelly of American youth,” be-
cause American youth was “tighten-
ing up.”

For several weeks Louis brooded
quietly in his dormitory room,
took up smoking a pipe, and lived
on Metrecal wafers. Then in a
fit of despair he tried to hang
himself in his closet. Unfortunately
his 98c Leggett’s tie was not strong
enough to support his short, plump,
pear-shaped body while he twist-
ed, kicked, and gasped his life
away. Therefore, the tie broke
even before his face had a chance
to turn a spectacular purple color
and he was unceremoniously
dumped into his dirty clothes pile.

After this ill-fated chance to
achieve greatness, Louis went to see
a head shrinker. This sage man ad-
vised him to “bend with the wind”
and become one of America’s “new

breed.” For several weeks Louis
valiantly endeavored to follow this
advice. He trundled into Pres

| Brown’s and bought a sweatsuit, a
| pair of tenny-pumps, and other as-
sorted gruesome paraphenalia. He
determined to run a mile every day
and to do calisthenics and isometric
exercises to boot.

It was drizzling softly under grey
skies when Louis began his first
workout. Eagerly he set off in his
new sweats and tenny-pumps. He
held his head high and ran like
a young deer (a short, plump, pear-
shaped young deer). After approx-
imately 100 yards he staggered and

“Who makes the decisions?” This |
is probably the single most important |
question one could ask in an at- |
tempt to discover the underlying
power basis of any society, whether
it be nation or tribe.

Most Americans naively believe
that important decisions in our
country are made by the elected
representatives of the people, that
these representatives actually re-
flect percentage-wise the interests of
the people, and that diverse inter-|
ests are so “balanced” that no one
interest or group of interests dom- |}
inates or controls the others, and that
the representatives of the people
are directly responsible to them and}
can be replaced at any time if they
fail to do as the people wish.

In a cogent and well-documented
book, The Power Elite, sociologist
C. Wright Mills effectively explodes
these false notions, which are based
on the realities and myths of the
past.

According to Mills, the important
decisions in America—the decisions
that determine the political and eco-
nomic conditions of our country and
affect the daily lives of our fellow
citizens—are made, controlled, or
presided over by a relatively small
and increasingly close-knit group of
men, “the power elite.” This group

reeled to a halt. His breath came
in burning gasps, his feet ached,
his right leg cramped, his head
spun, his eyes rolled backwards,
and he fainted face down in a pile
of slush.

Louis gave up his running routine
and devoted himself to calisthenics
and isometric exercises. He progress-
ed admirably for three days. Then in
a burst of overconfidence he held his
arm curl exercises for fifteen sec-

 

onds instead of only five, he for-
got to hold his breath, and he pro-

Kirkley Reports On “The Power Elite’
Asks Who Makes Decisions In American Society

Warlords or Military Ascendancy;
and the Political Directorate.

This power elite is not an aristoc-
racy, for it is not formal and ob-
vious; it is not actually a class, for
it is not completely aware of itself,
nor are others fully aware of it; and
it is not really a club or organiza-
tion, for its membership require-
ment, social rituals, and shared ac-
tivities, though generally known and
recognized by the in-group, are
not explicit.

Yet, though the power elite cannot
be classified in one of the above
categories, it does possess attributes
of each of them. And what is more
important for our nation and our
people, the members of this power
elite are becoming more and more
aware of themselves as a group
possessing common standards, com-
mon goals, and common means of
achieving those goals as they in-
crease in power, affluence, and in-
fluence,

A major factor contributing to the

members of the power elite is their
common background. About 90 per
cent of these decision-makers were
born into families in the upper
quarter of the income and occupa-
tional status-pyramids of this coun-
try. Their fathers were generally of
profesisonal or entrepreneural status,
if not among the corporate rich of

 

earlier generations; they are usually

duced a magnificent double hernia.

This unforeseen catastrophe not
only shattered his self-confidence
and will to live, it also sever-
ely limited his social life, since
he had to undergo an operation to
correct this rather unfortunate
malady. While he was recovering
from this ordeal, his favorite short,
plump, pear-shaped date, Erma
Frabbish, got pinned to the captain
of the UVa. football team. When
this news reached Louis in the

Episcopalian or Presbyterian, or per-
haps Congregational or Unitarian;
most of them attended an Ivy League
College; preferably Harvard or Yale,
though the military ascendancy
would have atended Anapolis or
The Point, and the corporate rich
probably a private Eastern prep
school, such as Choate or Groton
as well.

,

Members of the power elite dis-
tinguished each other by family
background, wealth, education, man-
ners, and, principally, by the po-
sitions which they occupy and the
amount of direct control which they
possess over others in the corporate,
military, or governmental bureauc-
racies. This group is net itself a
bureaucracy, which is a middle class
term, or is it subject to the machin-
ations of a bureacuracy; it is the
group which sets the standards for
admisison to the bureaucracies which
it controls, determines what func-
tions that bureaucracy will perform,
and decides who in the bureaucracy
will rise in power.

Many sociologists, anthropologists,
and philosophers of our day have
devoted themselves to the study and
description of modern mass society.
And, according to Mills, they have
diagnosed correctly the feelings of
anomie, marginality, and normless-
the sence of impotence, the
conformity, the inefficacy of these

Wrestling in the 130 pound class,
Montgomery’s season record is 5-1
and his 4-year slate at W&L now
stands at an impressive 26-7. Three
of his five wins this season have
been by pins.

Coach Miller calls Dave a good,
all-rounded wrestler. His statistics
readily prove this. He leads the grap-
plers in reversals and his three pins
place him second in that department.
He has given up only five points to
all of his opponents this season, an
average of less than one point per
match.

Dave has been co-captain of the
wrestling team for two years now,
and has served the team well in
that position. He is steady and re-
liable. Coach Miller feels that Dave
has served as an inspiration to
other team members.

Of Roanoke College; 77-72

Fighting a tough, uphill battle the
Washington and Lee basketball team
fell just short of upsetting a rough
Roanoke College five Wednesday
night at Salem, Va. Behind by as
much as twenty points at times, the
Generals fought back and at one
point were only two points down.

Perhaps one of the deciding fac-
tors in the game was the General’s
slow start in the first half. Where-
as the Generals were having
trouble sinking the ball, the Roa-
nokers were having trouble miss-
ing. Roanoke’s Cregger and Bak-
er did most of the scoring in the
first half with Cregger hitting from
the floor and Baker adding an
even 100 per cent from the foul
line. With this one-two combina-
tion Roanoke was safely in the
lead at the end of the first half,
36-27,

With the start of the second half
it looked as if the Generals would
continue at their original slow pace.
Then, with about eleven minutes
left in the game, the team suddenly
found the basket. Fauber and Pater-
no began to hit consistently. Coach
McHenry put in his press and Roa-
anoke slowed down like a car that

masses. But these are the trends
prevalent on the middle levels of
our social order and the theories
of power held by the masses apply
only to the middle levels of power
in America—to the bureaucracies,
to the rank-and-file business, gov-
ernment, and the military, and to
the Congress of the United States.

But the real answer to the ques-
tion, “Who makes the big decisions?”
is this: it is the power elite.

The facts have shifted during the
years. The power elite is hidden
from the view of the masses because
it is not formal or institutional and
because its workings are cloaked in
the garb of “Military secrecy” or
“the best interests of the people.”
The power elite is not a conspiracy,
and it is not actually a unified, co-
herent organization seeking to gain
power and control over the people
of the United States to promote its
own ends.

But it does have power, and it
does exercise control; and if this

control is the best for the country,
it is simply because the interests of
the power elite happen to coincide
with those of the country as a whole.
And it is probably true that the
members of the power elite regard
themselves as acting in the best in-
terests of the country, since they
are all good Americans—white,
Protestant, financially secure, well-
educated, parents.

Whether, in fact, this power elite
does decide issues in a way bene-
ficial to the whole country is a
matter for the reader to decide.

The most provocative question is
this: If the power elite does become
aware of itself, and if it does come
to serve its own interests rather
than those of the country which
has created it, can it possibly be ef-
fectively opposed?

Fenn Reveals Tragedy of Louis Macferb

infirmary, he went into a severe
decline, and the medical experts
there feared for his life.

However, a virtual miracle occur-
red this week which brought Louis
back from the brink of the grave.
And strangely enough, just as Mr.
Kennedy’s “New Frontier” had
nearly driven this short, plump,
pear-shaped, normally maladjusted
representative of the soft under-
belly of American youth to his death,
so the “New Frontier” snatched
poor Louis from the brink of Eterni-

| ty.

What was the momentous event
which saved Louis’ life and showed
him he was not out of step with his
times? Why, it was Pierre Salinger’s
renunciation of his proposed 50-
mile walk, which read in part as
follows:

“I may be ‘plucky,’ but I am not
stupid. I am moved not only by the
generous advice volunteered by
many doctors, but also by my com-
passion for those members of the

 

press corps who might have been
forced to participate in this under-
taking....The fitness of the entire
Administration has been amply dem-
onstrated by Attorney General Rob-
ert F. Kennedy’s 50-mile trek last
Sunday.”

...and what’s good enough for
the pear-shaped members of the
“New Frontier” is certainly good
enough for Louis Macferb.

Dr. S. P. Duvall Speaks Toni

By ROGER PAINE
Managing Editor

Tonight at 7:30 in the Student
Union the Washington Literary So-
ciety is sponsoring a talk on Her-
man Melville’s Billy Budd. Discus-
sion will be led by Dr. Severn P. C.
Duvall, head of the English depart-
ment,

In order that all those planning to
attend this talk may know the de-
tails of the story, this article will
summarize the book and some of
its implications. The movie Billy
Budd, which was adapted from a
play that was adapted from Melville’s
novel was recently featured at the
State.

Billy Budd was Melville’s last
novel, written shortly before he died
and never published during his life-
time. The book shows Melville’s
acceptance of the mystery and the
tragedy of life. It centers on Billy,
who is a handsome, simple, likeable
young sailor.

While serving on the merchant
ship Rights of Man, he is impressed
into military service for the Royal |

John Claggart, a mysterious figure
who the embodiment of evil
in the eyes of the crew.

The contrast between Claggart
and Billy is obvious from the start,
and the master-of-arms shows mal-
ice toward Billy for no apparent
motive. Billy maintains a tone of
forgiveness, however, which enrages
Claggart all the more.

Claggart trumps up a charge that
Billy is inciting the crew to mutiny,
and accuses Billy of this in front

Billy has a physical impediment—he | |

stammers—and after being accused
by Claggart of this complete un-
truth, he cannot express himself
verbally. So he defends himself in
the only way left to him—by a blow
with his fist. It lands on Claggart’s
jaw, and a few minutes later the
ship’s surgeon pronounces him dead.

The character of Captain Vere,
who is the only witness, now enters
the novel. He is an excellent officer—
one e of the best in the Navy. He is a

a recent mutiny aboard a ship of
the Royal Navy and he didn’t want
anything of the kind to happen on
the Indomitable.

After calling a court martial con-
sisting of his lieutenants, Captain
Vere poses the problem. They all
feel in their hearts that Billy should
not hang. If one considers the in-
tent of Billy, or the obvious lie
of Claggart, it would seem that Bil-
ly should be set free. Moreover, he
is a model sailor, loved by all the
crew—a man without a vice or an
evil intention.

But Vere points out to his subor-
dinates that these feelings cannot be
considered. Simple military justice
must prevail. The question of how
the members of the court can con-
demn to death a man whom they
feel to be innocent before God and
themselves is the crux of the trial.
In the end, it is held that the mili-
tary letter of the law must be

 

obeyed, and “however pitilessly that

Thus, Billy is hanged the next day

The theme, is the age-old theme of
good against evil. The novel has
religious implications—Billy as a
Christ figure—and political rami-
fications. Oniy two men on the In-
domitable realize what a _ moral
phenomemon Billy was—Claggart
and Captain Vere. The former set
out to destroy Billy because he,
Claggart, was the eternal evil op-

The latter was forced by the mili-

plan of destruction, despite his own

Optimistic On Far East Situation

Dr. David Anthony, the final
speaker for the ninth annual |
national Relations Week, spoke

last
night on “The Sino-Indian Conflict.” |

Dr. Anthony is director of a special |
Asian studies program which is be-
ing sponsored at Randolph-Macon |

Sweet Briar College. During World |
War II, Dr. Anthony gained ex-|
perience while serving as a Japanese |
language office in the Al- |
though he was awarded a Ph.D. from |
Yale University, he also attended |
Harvard, Cornell, and Princeton.

After discussing Chinese heritage,
Dr. Anthony divided his lecture into
four parts: (1) the intentions of the
Chinese government in regard to
India, (2) the significance of the
disputes for future development of
India, (3) relation of Communist
China’s policy towards India to the
doctrinal dispute in the Communist
Party, and (4) the significance of
the Indian-Sino border dispute to

Far East.

the free world.

Dr. Anthony pointed out that
China probably had four reasons for
the attack on India. Basically, the

 

Chinese were jealous of recent In-

| furthermore destroy

dian economic success, for the
Chinese want the rest of Asia to look
up to them—not India. Secondly, the
Chinese wanted to destroy Nehru’s
| leadership of the neutral bloc and
India’s leader-
ship in this bloc. Finally, the Chinese
wanted to obtain strategic spots on
the between China and In-
cia.

Continuing, Dr. Anthony proceed-
ed to the effeets of the conflict on
India. Of course, the movement by
the Chinese Communist destroyed
the unity of the Communist Party in
India. Moreover, the conflict has
caused the Indian economy to lag
money used to bolster the
economy must now be spent for de-

border

because

fense. Finally, the border dispute
has probably drawn the Indians
closer together in order to defend
their country.

According to Dr. Anthony, this
conflict has not caused all the Com-
munist Parties in Asia to oppose
China, but it has caused a split

among the parties and brought to
a point the underlying differences of
and Chinese Communism.

was director for 56 years of the
annual Freshman Camp.

He served in the army during both
World Wars, and from 1920 to 1926

The ‘Free Day’

On Friday, May 24, there will be no classes. Last spring,
and every spring before it, a full day of classes was held on
that Friday. It is the day which immediately precedes the spring
set of final exams.

 

This new resolution was passed in the most recent meeting
of the faculty. It came as the result of an editorial which was
printed last fall in this edition of the Ring-tum Phi. The con-
tent of that editorial was approved by the EC and taken before
a faculty committee by an editor of this paper. The fact that
such a free day has been granted raises some important con-
siderations.

It shows, in the first place, that the faculty is concerned
with student opinions, and that when those opinions are well-
expressed and appear to have merit, they will be seriously
considered and acted upon. W&L has a teaching faculty which
is not willing to give up a day ordinarily devoted to classroom
activities in past years. The fact that they did so represents
a far greater step than some students may realize.

Secondly, the free day places a burden of responsibility
on the student body. Notice that this is an experiment, not a
permanent rule. The preservation of this opportunity for
greater study before exams depends on the manner in which
the students use their newfound freedom late in May.

But thirdly, and most important of all, studnts have some-
thing concrete which will most assuredly help them on their
exams if they use the time to advantage. Last semester there
could be nothing so concrete offered to the students because
the proposal came up too late in the term. Now that this more
definite move has been made, it remains to the students to
prove that they appreciate the chance given them.

Departing Professors

The announcement in today’s paper of Dr. T. E. Hughes’
decision not to return to W&L prompts us to comment on what
appears to be an unfortunate trend.

In less than a year, the University has lost three of its
most respected and well-reputed professors: Mr. Day in the
English department, Dr. Harvey Wheeler in the political
science department, and now Dr. Hughes, associate professor
of history. In each case, a man of real academic calibre, in the
eyes of students and faculty members alike, has been lost.

Mr. Day, whose conscientious preparation for classroom
lectures and unique ability to draw student interest made him
a popular instructor, left for greener fields of research at the
University of Virginia. A probable raise in salary and the
opportunity to work with some original manuscripts drew Day
to our northern neighbor—in addition, surely, to personal
reasons.

Dr. Wheeler, whose recently published Fail-Safe is topping
the current best seller lists, is taking a position at Yale gradu-
ate school where he will have more opportunity, we understand,
to write and to do extensive research. Wheeler’s reputation
among students as a thorough and highly qualified instructor
wasn’t enough, evidently, to keep him at W&L.

As for Dr. Hughes, who is reputedly one of the foremost
experts on technological history, we are indeed unhappy to
learn that he will not be returning in the fall. Hughes, to quote
a student who had him last year, “had the unique ability of
inspiring intellectual curiosity. The best possible estimate I
can give of Dr. Hughes’ teaching is that he made people want
to learn.” This, seemingly, was the general concensus among
students familiar with Hughes. He has decided, so we under-
stand, to take a position at MIT beginning in the fall.

However, it does seem unfortunate that within so short
a span of time three of the best qualified members of our
faculty should leave. Perhaps—and we believe this to be the
case—there is some relation between their departure and the
academic community here at Washington and Lee.

At least two of the men mentioned here were dissatisfied
with the University library. According to them, materials for
research and further study that they wanted to do was just not
available in the school stacks.

Complaints, too, have been voiced about professors’ hav-
ing to teach large numbers of courses, especially freshman and
sophomore courses. This in the opinion of the editor, is not
really a valid complaint considering the unique nature of Wash-
ington and Lee. It is a small school, and a teacher who doesn’t
want to teach seems a contradiction. Perhaps one of W&L’s
most attractive characteristics is that it has a teaching faculty,
not a long list of well-known researchers who seldom see the
inside of a classroom.

A further reason for professional dissatisfaction could
very well be money. Here we are not quite sure why such a
thing should be so. From all appearances, there are sufficient
funds to pay adequate salaries to men worth keeping at the
University.

Whatever the reasons—and there are probably many—
some serious consideration should be given to the loss of men
like Day, Hughes, and Wheeler. Possibly there are more facul-
ty members contemplating leaving, although we hope this is not
the case. Both administrators and students alike need to ex-
amine the implications behind the departure of worthwhile
faculty members from the staff. Some of the reasons for their
leaving, undoubtedly, lie within the University itself.

 

THE RING-TUM PHI

Mass Media Condemned As ‘Perverse’;
Kirkley Suggests Strict Censoring Law

 

Letters
To The
Editor...

Writer Criticizes
Lack of I-M News

I would like to remind the editors
of the Ring-tum Phi that there is
still an intramural program at this
university. Apparently they are un-
aware of this fact—for there has not
been a single line devoted to intra-
mural news all year. There hasn’t
been one article, one score, not even
a listing of the overall intramural
standings in the Ring-tum Phi.

Do the editors feel that there is
no longer any intrest in the intra-
mural program? Or do they feel that
it is too much trouble to walk over
to the gymnasium to check on in-
tramural results?

It is evident, I feel, that there is
still interest in the program; every
fraternity participates, there have
been very few forfeits this year;
and both players and referees, as
well as the Intramural Council, have
devoted a lot of time and effort to
making the program a success. If
interest and enthusiasm are less than
in past years, it is mainly the fault
of the papers’ failure to publicize
any of the intramural events.

Wouldn't it be possible to devote
a small portion of the valuable
space on the sports page to a list-
ing of intramural scores? Perhaps
one whole article might even be
printed occasionally—it certainly
would not detract from the overall
content of the sports page—it might
even add a little reader interest.

Sincerely,

ROBERT STAUFFER

 

 

 

Pace Acclaims
‘La Dolce Vita’
As Top Art Film

By TOM PACE

“La Dolce Vita” begins at the
Lyric Theatre tomorrow. It is di-
rected by Federico Fellini, and stars,
among others, Marcello Mastroianni,
Anouk Aimee, Yvonne Furneau,
Anita Ekberg, Lex Barker, and
Jacques Sernas. “La Dolce Vita” has
received twenty-eight important in-
ternational awards, ineluding Can-
nes Golden Palm and _ Venice’s
Leono d’Oro. Several publications
have acclaimed it as an all-time
classic, and many named it the
Best Film of 1961.

The Intellectual’s Plight

“La Dolce Vita’s” major theme is
that of the intellectual’s plight in
life. Marcello Mastroianni plays the
searching intellet employed by a
newspaper as its night-life colum-
ist. The story concerns seven days
in his life. During these seven days
Marcello is given chances at the
supposd keys to happiness. Also
during these days, several import-
ant characters confront the viewer.

There is the girl with whom Mar-
cello lives. She is simple and pretty
and is shown to us in contrast to
Marcello. Her only desires are to
love and be loved. However, Mar-
cello cannot love her, and she, like
him, is necessarily unhappy. Next
there is the wealthy girl who may
be had by anybody. Marcello comes
to believe that they might be happy
together, and tells her so. Yet while
she talks to him, another man, any
man, seduces her, and Marcello’s
glimmer is dimmed. The society col-
umnist has a successful novelist and
family-man friend named Steiner.
Steiner says that his way is no better
than Marcello’s and emphasizes that
fact rather subtly later on. Besides
Steiner, there is Marcello’s father,
who, when visiting the city, is taken
out on the town. But he cannot
stand the strain of fast life and
returns to the routine life at home
with his wife, Fellini introduces a
little irony by presenting a sixteen
year-old blonde girl, referred to
as The Innocent. In her Marcello
sees himself at the same age. And
you are to assume that she, too, will
have no chance, but will be en-
gulfed by the same society that
takes Marcello.

Key to Happiness

The theme is a somewhat simple
one. The film shows the frustrations
of man, the emptiness of man. There
is no real key to happiness. None of
the old answers—love, religion, sex,
family, suecess—can work for the
intellectual of today. A man’s search
leaves him as baffled as he was be-
fore starting. The theme is a uni-
versal one; it holds true in all coun-
tries. This is one reason for its
greatness.

But saying is not enough. How
something is said must also bear

(Continued on page 4)

 

By JOHN KIRKLEY

Culture is acquired, not inherited.
The aspirations, the convictions, the
ways of thinking, the patterns of ac-
tion, and the tastes of men are
formed by the impressions they re-
ceive from parents, teachers, the
mass media, and their peers during
the life-long process of socialization.
And since it is the earlier impres-
sions which are the most important
in the formation of the later man, the
impressions children receive should
be carefully sereened so that they
will develop into the kind of adults
we wish them to be.

Now this is certainly not the place
to embark on a detailed discusion of
what children should be made into
(and indeed, parents do make chil-
dren into something whether they do
so consciously or unconsciously); but
certain goals could surely be agreed
upon. We want our children to be
healthy, intelligent, imaginative hu-
man beings, capable of apprehending
reality in its many dimensions, and
able to use their abilities responsi-
bly to adapt that reality to the serv-
ice of mandkind. And I think we
could agree that we want our chil-
dren to develop excellence in their
own lives as well as strive to offer

 

their fellows the opportunity to real-
ize their unique forms of excellence.

Pernicious Impressions
Americans have devised many |
ways of systematically cheating their |
children (and all future generations) |
by consistently exposing them to|
pernicious impressions—ideas and
expressions deleterious to their de-
velopment into autonomous, intelli-
gent, imaginative human beings. One
way parents do this is by allowing
the mass media to flourish uncheck-
ed.

By “mass media” I mean such
forms of distribution of communi-
cable data as radio, movies, the
newspapers, advertising, magazines,
and_ television—occasionally termed
the “moronoscope” or “Boob-Tube”
by some. And the reason I feel these
mass media constitute a spreading
form of social atrocity is this: The
mass media, as their name suggests,
are designed to disperse large quan-
tities of communities matter to large
numbers of people, which they do;
most of the matter dispersed by these
mass media is banal, trite, colorless,
devoid of taste, unimaginative, non-
inspirational, and keyed to the baser
interests and desires of men rather
than to their nobler characteristics;

 

the impressions which we and our
children, receive from these mass
media influence our thought patterns
and therefore our motivations, aspi-
rations, ideals and behavior; there-
fore, the influence of the mass me-
dia is non-functional to the develop-
ment of free, responsible, and imag-
inative individuals.

To Think and To Act

People will do what they are
trained to do. If they are trained to
follow their inclinations, their emo-
tions, their desires, they will do so;
if they are trained to obey the dic-
tates of their intellect, their reasons,
their conscience, they will do so.
For this reason, it is important that
we teach our children, by word and
by example, to think and act in the
present as we would wish them to
act in the future.

Because the mass media are de-
signed to hold the attention of the
masses, they appeal to the universal
rather than the particular in man:
they appeal to our desire to be
amused, entertained, excited; to our
desire to feel alternate tension and
ego-gratification, security, a feeling
of well-being; and to our desire to
be informed.

Geared to the Average

Now obviously I cannot rail
against the disbursal of good enter-
tainment or accurate information;
but it is a fact that the mass media
provide little high calibre entertain-
ment and a paucity of accurate infor-
mation. And this is due to two
causes: first, the mass media are
designed to be understood by the
masses, rather than by the few, and,
therefore, the language and the forms
of entertainment employed by the
mass media are geared to the aver-
age, which is well-night equivalent
to the mediocre; second, and most
unfortunate, the audiences which
receive the impressions of the mass
media are content with what they
receive and will not demand either
high quality entertainment, a chal-
lenging program of instruction, or
even the presentation of relevant
and accurate information about
problems of current interest.

A further noxious effect of the
mass media is the pressure towards
conformity which is exerted by the
systematic presentation of similar
material to large numbers of people.
High school students from Miami
to Seattle listen to the same popu-
lar songs on the radio while riding
home from a sport event in which

 

similarly dressed teams played a
game following the same rules while
cheered by girls whose hair styles,
lipstick, and clothing are stereo-
typed for the nation. Fourth graders
throughout America spend hours
every day watching the same shows
on television or reading the same
comic books. In fact, the cheer-
leader, the mouseketer, and Super-
man are almost national heroes; they
are certainly as widely known as the
name of our president, but their
activities are followed by more peo-
ple with closer interest than are
the activities of President, Congress-
man, Ambassador, educator, labor
leader, businessman or even next-
door neighbor. People who receive
the same impressions from the same
sources will tend to look, think,
dres, and act alike.

Destroys Ability to Think

Perhaps the most harmful effect of
the mass media is that it destroys
our ability to think. Thinking is a
symbolic process; the higher forms
of thinking, including memory, com-
plex association, foresight, planning,
even average problem solving, and
all advanced communication, in-
cluding the possibilities of transfer-
ring and preserving knowledge, re-
quire language—the use of word
symbols. And the mass media, be-
cause they are designed to be under-
stood by the masses, use only a few
of the vast number of words made
available to us by our rich language.
By repeating these words over and
over, they limit our ability to think
by limiting our effective vocabulary,
by failing to stimulate our minds to
more complex thoughts, and by
wearing out the words they do use.

‘Boycott Mass Media’

The only way for us to avoid
the harmful effects of the mass
media, not only as they apply to us,
but more especially as they under-
mine the potential of our children
to develop into autonomous, intel-
ligent, responsible individuals, is to
boycott them individually and col-
lectively where possible, to keep
them from our children by refusing
their entrance into our homes, and
to demand better quality and greater
accuracy in the media we do receive.

We have passed laws to punish
rape and to discourage narcotics
peddling, why not develop laws, or
at least social sanctions, against the
evil effects of the mass media—
which cause a rape of the mind and
and a doping of the soul?

here in Lexington in 1870, in his new
book, Lee After the War. This is
Dr. Fishwick’s eleventh book and
was published by Dodd, Mead & |
Company this past January. |

Dr. Fishwick, Professor of Amer-
ican Studies here at W&L, is cur- |
rently on leave doing research on
the teaching and presentation of
history on the secondary level at the
duPont Foundation in Wilmington,
Delaware.

Lee’s Last Years

Dr. Fishwick’s new book is an in- |
teresting study of the last years of
the General’s life, and contains much
of interest to students of Washing- |
ton and Lee, as the history of the
General’s last few years is necessarily
fused with the history of Washing-
ton College during that time.

Dr. Fishwick opens his book in)
Richmond just before the end of the |
war, where Lee is desperately try- |
ing to defend that city, the last hope |
of the Confederacy. Petersburg falls
and Appomattox isn’t far away.

Fishwick’s treatment of the sur-
render is one of the most moving |
parts of the book. We see General |
Lee don a spotless, new uniform and |
his jeweled sword to meet Grant!
at the McLean house.

‘It Was My Fault’

Lee did not look for a scapegoat
to blame the defeat of the South on.
Instead he simply said, “It was all
my fault. I thought my men were
invincible.”

Along with the story of Lee, Fish-
wick also ties in much of the history
of the times. His second chapter is
devoted to Lincoln’s visit to the
surrendered and half-burned city of
Richmond. He then describes events
in Washington in celebration of the
surrender of the Confederacy and
gives a short but effective account
or the assassination of Lincoln.

Lee was now back among his

|

 

 

family and the defeated people of

the South. Before long came the
visit from Judge Brockenbrough,
representing the trustees of Wash-
ington College requesting him to
become President of the bankrupt
college. His letter dated several days
after the visit is perhaps the most
famous that he penned.
Accepted Presidency

The letter read, in part, “I think it
is the duty of every citizen, in the
present condition of the country to
do all in his power to aid in the res-
toration of peace and harmony, and
in no way to oppose the policy of the
state or general government directed
to that object. It is particularly in-

| cumbent on those charged with the

instruction of the youth to set them
an example of submission to au-
thority, and I could not consent to
be the cause of animadversion upon
the college.” He went to say that
he would accept the judgment of the
Board of Trustees and if they still
desired him as president, he would
accept. Before long he was on his
way to Lexington.

In a few months he was called to
Washington to appear before the
Congressional Reconstruction Com-
mittee, headed by the bitter Thad-
deus Stevens. The committee grilled
him quite lengthily, but, accord-

ing to Dr. Fishwick’s account, was |

unable to even once make him lose
his temper or composure.
Interesting to Students

Dr. Fishwick’s chapter devoted to
Lee’s presidency here at W&L is a
most interesting one. He describes
many scenes familiar to W&L stu-
dents such as his office in the
basement of the chapel, of which
he supervised the construction. While
here at W&L Lee took personal
charge of the college finances and
instituted a system of meetings and
reports that made Washington Col-
lege a well organized institution.
He was familiar with the record of
every student and knew them all
by sight and name. He added many
departments to the college, and it
was during this time that the South-
ern Collegian came into being, then

 

Last Years

a “semi-monthly publication of liter-
ary societies.”
Trip Through Old South

Lee faced many problems here at
the college, but his greatest challenge
was a trip he made through the
South in early 1870. It began in
March and before it was over he
had traveled two thousand miles.
He was cheered everywhere as he
had become the symbol of ‘the Old
South and the Lost Cause.

On October 12, 1870, General Lee
died. The buildings of Lexington
were draped in black, including the
columns of Washington Hall. He was
buried near his office in Lee Chapel
in a plain, black suit.

Dr. Fishwick closes his book with
the following passage, which is in
essence, the theme of his book: “For-
get the Lee of battle, and see the
old man moving among Lexington’s
children. Forget the general in gray,
and see the old fellow in the black
suit moving back and forth between
his home and his chapel. Focus
sharply on this man. For this is
Robert E. Lee.

Forgive, Forget and Rebuild

Fishwick pictures Lee not as the
great general leading armies to vic-
tory, but as the great man striv-
ing to forgive, forget, and rebuild.

On the whole, Dr. Fishwick’s
book is an interesting and moving

| study of Lee’s last few years, but the

 

book is not without its faults. One
of these is over-stentimentality.
Fishwick is obviously a great ad-
mirer and praiser of Lee, and he
tends to allow his personal feelings
to bog down his account of several
of the incidents of the book.

He also tends to include many tri-
vial incidents in his efforts not to
exclude anything from his account.
In other passages, however, he
sounds like a writer and not merely
a historian writing a typical histor-
ical account of a man’s life.

Lee a God?

Another fault of the book is that
Dr. Fishwick seems to over-praise
Lee, presenting him as without fault

Thursday At Sewanee

 

WEL Faces Southwestern In CAC Tourney

By JOHN ALLGOOD
Sports Editor

An elimination match between
Southwestern at Memphis and Wash-
ingotn and Lee University will open
the first College Athletic Confer-
ence basketball tournament Thurs-
day at 9 pm. (CST) at Sewanee,
Tenn.

The winner of the Lynx-Generals
game will advance to Friday’s sem-
ifinals against tournament favorite
Washington University of St. Louis.
Game time is 7:30 p.m. The other
semi-final contest pits Sewanee
against Centre College at 9 p.m.

The championship is set for 9 p.m,
Saturday with a consolation game
preceding it at 7:30.

Washington Winning

Washington brings the only win-
ning record to the five-team event.
The Bears have sailed past most of
their 17 opponents easily. Only three
of their 11 wins have been by less
than 11 points—a pair of one-point
triumphs over Wheaton and Valpa-
raiso, and a three-point victory over
Eastern Illinois.

What’s more impressive about the
Bears is the type of competition

Randolph-Macon, the champions

ence, invades Doremus Gymnasium,
tonight, in W&L’s final regular sea-
son basketball encounter.

The Generals hope to raise their
season mark to 5-11 before leaving
for the College Athletic Conference
tournament, beginning Thursday at
Sewanee.

R-M Tough

R-M poses a formidable threat
to the Generals’ ambitions. Big Frank
Kaminski, the nation’s eighth leading
rebounder in the small college ranks,
paces the Jackets’ attack.

Coach Bobby McHenry’s club will
be trying to rebound from their third
heart-breaking defeat at the foul
line—a 57-49 loss to Baltimore Uni-
versity Saturday.

For the third straight game the
Generals equalled or bettered their
opponents from the floor, only to be
outgunned at the charity stripe.

in the major college ranks—Loyola

only other teams that have managed
to collar the high-scoring Bears.
Sewanee 6-8
Sewanee, the host team, brings a
6-8 record to the tournament. Cen-

Sweitzer Leads
6th Frosh Win

W&L’s frosh basketball team,
playing its best game of the season,
axed Ferrum Junior College for
the first time in five years Friday,
62-55.

Paced by Steve Sweitzer, who
played despite a cold, and Bill Man-
ley the Generals overcame a 31-23
halftime Ferrum lead and won go-
ing away.

Manley’s Jumper Key

Bill Manley’s jump shot put the
Generals ahead to stay with 5:20
left in the game at 54-53. Tom Poore
followed with another jumper and
the Generals were on their way.

Two free throws upped the margin
to 58-53 and W&L went into a semi-
freeze.

Sweitzer, who managed only three
points in the first half, and Manely
paced the attack with 18 points each.

“It was truly a team effort,” said
coach Joe Lyles. “Everybody played
well.”

Following Sweitzer and Manley,
in the scoring was guard John
Moore, who played a terrific game
as the Generals’ playmaker, with 11

points.

jumped 6-0 in the high jump to
place second to state champ, Bill

Relay Fourth

A fourth place in the mile relay
insured the Generals of a fifth place
finish in the meet.

A strong team of John Pearson,
John Barnes, Dave Myers, and Skip
Essex turned in 3:41.6.

Pearson, running leadoff, and Es-
sex, running anchor, turned in the
top W&L times. Pearson ran a :54.5
quarter and Essex turned in a :49.6.

VMI won the meet. It was follow-
ed by VPI, William and Mary, Old
Dominion, and W&L. Finishing be-
low the Generals were the University
of Virginia, Roanoke, Bridgewater,

Lynchburg, Randolph-Macon, and

Despite capturing only three first
places, Monday, the W&L swimming
team tripped West Virginia, 50-45,
at Morgantown.

 

Sewanee was 2-1 on the strength
of a pair of triumphs over South-
western. Washington and Lee was
0-1 and Southwestern, 0-2. Since
Washington joined the conference
after it was formed, it did not sched-
ule any CAC games this season.

Washington’s Sandy Pomerantz, a
6-6, 210-pound senior from Univer-
sity City, Mo., could be the out-
standing individual performer in the
tournament. Pomerantz brings a 20.7
scoring average, a 10.9 rebounding
mark, a .461 field goal percentage and
a .763 free throw accuracy to Se-
wanee.

Fauber Tops

His nearest rival is a comparative-
ly small player—Washington and
Lee’s Rodger Fauber. Despite his
lack of height, Fauber, a 6-2, 175-
pound senior from Lynchburg, Va.,
has earned himself a place in the
national small college rebounding
leaders for the third straight year.

In 12 games Fauber has gathered
255 rebounds for a 21.3 average and
a fourth-place ranking. Last year,

Mel Mounts scored a 5-0 win
over 123 pounder Butch West and
Chick Faust scored a 6-2 triumph
over Dave Montgomery at 130.

Pete Winfield kept his undefeated

of the season. Winfield nearly pinned

ninth with an 189 mark and in

17.6 average.

Rebounding, however, is not Faub-
er’s only asset. He also paces W&L
in scoring with an 18.3 average and
a field goal accuracy with a .455

After Pomerantz and Fauber the
rebounding and scoring honors are
up for grabs.

Southwestern boasts three men

ing averages. Aubery Smith, a 6-5,

David Miles, 6-6, 195-pounds from

on its total value. Director Fellini
shows much imagination in putting
this film togther. He represents the
useless “keys” cleverly. He mingles
the characters in and out of the
story very well. He uses his camera
expertly, and draws fine prformances
from all of his actors, particularly
Mastroianni and Miss Aimee. Per-
haps, however, the finest technical
point of the film is Nino Rota’s mus-
ical score. His music is at all times
entertaining. Particularly outstand-
ing are the La Dolce Vita theme and
his rendition of Arrivederci Roma.
My only complaints with the film are
that it is sometimes a litle slow and
at other times too grandiose, too
gaudy. Nonetheless, Fellini has pro-
duced a major work in the cinema;
and his accomplishment is a fine one.

and his final chapter, entitled “The
Resurrection” pictures Lee as the
“guardian angel of the South.” No
one denies that Lee was a great man,
but then he was a man not a god,
as Dr. Fishwick seems to believe.

The book does give a thorough
account of Lee’s last years and is
certainly of interest to students of
Lee and to people connected with
the University. The book has its high
points, and its weaknesses are
probably compensated for by these
to make the book worth reading.

Faculty, Students To Confer

On Fraternity

Tomorrow night the IFC wil

conference with members of the faculty for the purpose of
discussing possible improvements in Washington and Lee’s

fraternity system.

IFC President Ross Kyger said that the banquet, followed

by regulated discussion groups,
ideas which the IFC could put into¥
practice. The discussions behind
closed doors will be the first of
their kind between students and fac-
ulty at Washington and Lee.

Faculty members who have been
invited include advisers to fraterni-
ties, members of the faculty com-
mittee on fraternities, and others
who have shown particular interest
in issues planned for discussion, ac-
cording to Kyger. They will meet
with the IFC representatives of each
of the 18 houses on campus.

Dinner will be served at 6:30 p.m.
in the R. E. Lee Hotel. Following
the meal small discussion groups
will be formed to examine a number
of topics chosen in advance by the
IFC. Notes will be taken in each
conference, and the opinions expres-
sed will be compiled, reported on,
and evaluated for possible use by
the IFC.

Among topics which are to be dis-
cussed, Kyger said, are fraternity
finances; the fraternity role in aca-
demic life; deferred rush; social
costs and activities; pledging pro-
grams; more power for the IFC
to discipline individual houses; the
assimilation of non-fraternity stu-
dents into fraternities; and the basic
need for fraternities at Washing-
ton and Lee.

The IFC expressed hope that to-
morrow night’s meeting and “brain-
storming” session with faculty mem-
bers will result in workable ideas
to be applied to the fraternities.

In its meeting last night, the IFC
also moved to alleviate the burden
placed at present on the single fra-
ternity which must pay for a Dance
Set cocktail party. Kyger presented
a statement which will be sent to
the Executive Committee asking
that this expense be paid by a whole
class rather than one house, since
the class presidents are to serve as
Dance Set presidents next year.

Kyger also said the IFC has been
attempting to better assimilate
W&L’s foreign students into the
university by a new program which
allows them to choose the fraterni-
ty at which they take meals. In the
past the foreign students moved
periodically from house to house.

 

EC Names Committee

The Executive Committee has
named Buck Ogilvie, Lamar Lamb,
and Jim Rowe as a screening com-
mittee for Dean Gilliam Award can-
didates.

Students and faculty members
should submit letters reeommending
students for the award to a member
of the screening committee, or mail
letters to Jim Rowe, Box 366.

Debate Squad
Cops Honors
At Two Meets

By JOE ROSENBLOOM

In the highly competitive Camellia
Tournament at the University of
South Carolina and in a University
of Richmond meet, the W&L debate
team has earned significant wins,
according to forensics director Wil-
liam W. Chaffin.

Paced by the “dazzling” perform-
anee of junior Ed Norton, a four
man squad which also included Ed
Fitzgerald, Jack Eure, and Rick
Kneipper finished second among |
eight schools in the Camellia Invita- |
tional Tourney of February 15th and |
16th. The Generals won a total of
nine matches while losing five in
the round robin competition.

Norton teamed with Ed Fitzgerald
to argue the affirmative, triumphing
in five of seven matches and copping
second place individual honors in a
field of thirty-two. Coach Chaffin
commented on Norton’s showing as
“superlative, just superlative.”

Presenting the negative side, Jack
Eure and Rick Kneipper compiled
a record of four wins against three
losses. Kneipper was the tourney’s
sixth best speaker.

Mr. Chaffin praised the entire
team and further remarked, “This
was a particularly strong showing,
and the results were most extraor-
dinary considering that we were
without our first stringers, Bill Noell
and Al Eckes.”

At the Richmond Invitational
Tournament on February 22, W&L
was again represented by a four
man unit. On this occasion fresh-
man Ed Fitzgerald and Mike Hay-
slip combined their talents to
emerge with a third place trophy in
the novice division.

The two novice debaters were vic-
torious in four of six matches. They
both received certificates of excel-
lence for their distinguished efforts.

Ace debaters, Noell and Eckes, ac-
companied by Mr. Chaffin, are
scheduled to depart for major
tournaments at the Naval Academy
and at Georgetown University in the
next three weeks.

Law Students Stage
Feigned Court Case
In 1963 Mock Trial

By STEVE CASE

The semi-annual Mock Trial was
held on Wednesday, Feb. 20, under
the auspices of the Washington and
Lee School of Law Student Bar
Association. Law school professor
Robert Huntley presided over the
Trial Court of Tucker Hall, and
Robert Coyle, intermediate Law stu-
dent, served as its bailiff.

Mock Trial is designed to give law
students practice in trial advocacy,
and to familiarize them with pre-
trial procedural steps.

This year’s case, Kilgallen versus
M. B. M. Studios, Inc., was drawn
up by Paul Boswell and Richard
Canterbury, co-chairmen of Mock
Trial. It involves an alleged offer
for a reward to anyone able to prove
that M. B. M.’s leading man, Rock
Talbot, didn’t perform all of his
own dangerous stunts in his new
movie, “Strange Journey.”

The case was based on a similar
one used last year in Harvard's
Mock Trial program, and lay in the
realm of Contract’s law. In order to
recover the $5,000 reward the plain-
tiff had to prove first that there was
a valid offer, second, that he had
accepted the offer, and third, that
he had proved what was required
and was, therefore, entitled to the
reward.

Richard Tavss and Ben Meluskey,
intermediate law students, were the
attorneys for the Plaintiff, and Peter
Bryant, intermediate law students,
Dauk, senior law student, and Brick
were the Defendant's Attorneys. Re-
search assistants to the attorneys in-
cluded Sandy Walton, Stan Atwood,
Thomas Krook, and Michael Bower-

man,
The witnesses in the trial were
ably portrayed by John Dunnel,

Thomas Budd, James Hague, Rich-
ard Bartlett, and Miss Cynthia Le
Rue.

The jury found for the Defendant,
M. B. M. Studios, Inc., denying the
Plaintiff reeovery of the reward, and
disclosed that the Plaintiff had pre-
vailed on the first and second, but
not on the third issue.

Campus Room

The University Christian Associa-

the first floor of the Student Union
Building in the hope of stimulating
informal student conversations.

The redecorating was in the hands |
of a committee headed by George
Spaulding and Tom Edwards. At
various times as many as 15 UCA
members aided in the project.

The room was completely repaint-
ed and new furniture, lamps and a
wall-to-wall carpet was added. Mrs.
Ed Atwood aided the UCA workers
in selecting the color scheme and
furniture.

In the future, book shelves will
be added to hold the nine magazine
subscribed to by the Association.
Among those currently subscribed
to are Time, Atlantic Monthly and
Christian Century.

In addition, paper-backs from the
Reflection Book Series will be on
sale in the room. The books cover
a wide variety of topics in the 42
titles available, but mostly deal with
Theology and ethies.

‘Tartuffe’

Carolyn Bing,

Dr. Jones Play Lead Roles
By JOHN KIRKLEY

Tomorrow night at 8:30 the curtain at the Troubadour
Theatre will rise for Tartuffe, a comedy by Moliere and the
second Troub production of the year. The play promises to be
the entertainment highlight of the mid-winter season: it is
colorful, well-played, and uproariously funny.

Reservations should be made in advance at the box office
——* which will be open from two until

six and from seven until eight in
the evenings. The play will run
through Saturday, including a mat-
inee Saturday afternoon at three.

Like many of Moliere’s finest
plays, Tartuffe is a classic satire de-
signed to point out the foibles and
follies of his age. In Tartuffe, which
attacks hypocritical piety and greedy
otherworldliness, Moliere shows that
no vice is beyond the scope of com-
edy.

The setting for the play is the
fashionable home of Monsieur Orgon
(John Dunnell), a good-hearted,
trusting, credulous man. Quickly an
argument develops between Madame
Pernelle, the grandmother (Carolyn
Bing), and the other members of
the household. Mme, Pernelle, stiff,
straight, and strict, scolds them each
in turn; then just as she is about
to leave, Tartuffe, (Dr. Cecil Jones)
is mentioned and she rails anew at
the family for their treatment of
their guest.

As the play develops, one learns
that Orgon has taken Tartuffe, sup-
posedly a penniless but godly man,
into his household. Orgon has treat-
ed Tartuffe to every pleasure he
could offer: food, clothing, shelter,
comfortable quarters; furthermore
it seems that he is reconsidering his
promise to allow his lovely young
Marianne (Betsy Letcher),
to marry his good friend Valere
(George Chapman), and is ponder-
ing instead her marriage to Tartuffe.

It is obvious from the beginning
that Tartuffe has radically influ-
enced the behavior of Orgon. It is
also obvious that the other mem-
bers of the household, which include
Orgon’s wife Elmire (Susy Dunnell),
his son Damis (Charlie Bright), and
the house servant Dorine (Lisa
Tracy), regard as unwelcome their
guest, see him more as a hypocrite
than as a sincerely religious man.

Nor do the actions of Tartuffe, as
characters,
seem to merit the great esteem in
which the master and Mme Pernelle
hold him.

Tartuffe first enters halfway
through the play; he is seen en-
grossed in a book and carrying a
hair shirt and scourge. This entrance
has been carefully prepared for by
Moliere, for the audience has al-
ready had the opportunity to form
an estimation of his character which
is subsequently fully justified.

As the work of Tartuffe becomes
more complete, Orgon disinherits his
son (primarily for telling the truth),
makes arrangements for the imme-
diate marriage of his daughter to
his guest, and signs over to Tartuffe
the deed to his home, thus making
him his heir. Meanwhile Tartuffe

| attempts to seduce Elmire.

Foiled, he finds a means to black-

|}mail Orgon and also takes before
| the court of Louis XIV his legally
| valid

deed to Orgon’s house and

A Word On ReVue

Amid all the cries among students and faculty members
alike for more seminars and more intellectual stimulation, one
man has done something about it.

Mr. Jay Laurence Taylor,

uages, took the initiative some

instructor in Romance Lang-
weeks ago to set up ReVue—

a program of high calibre films, functioning on a subscription
basis. Mr. Taylor, along with his few student assistants, deserve
a great deal of credit for organizing, promoting, and staging

successfully the weekly series.

So far, the presentations have run the gamut of topics
from a French philosophical allegory to a documentary on a
Congolese tribe. The program has already proved itself a sig-
nificant addition to the academic life of the University, and
we sincerely hope that ReVue will become a permanent thing

at W&L.

A Flaunted Tradition

In the past two months a number of students have scorned
the tradition of conventional dress on campus. Many of them
have not been called before the Assimilation Committee be-
cause that committee has been more lax than usual recently.

It has been the cry of our more liberal students that there
should be no Assimilation Committee. They maintain that
the mere existence of such a committee makes Washington
and Lee’s traditions become mere rules. They claim that W&L
gentlemen should behave as gentlemen naturally—not because

they are made to.

Realizing this, the Assimilation Committee informally de-
cided to see what would happen if its function was relaxed. The
result should be obvious to any concerned W&L student. So-
called “gentlemen” are walking around the campus in blue
jeans and tennis shoes, without any sport coat, sometimes

without a tie.
Many students have been

wearing black or red_ shirts.

What makes it worse, it seems that in order to be Joe Studly
one has to let his hair grow for two or three months. Must we
remind students of the spirit of our conventional dress—that
all W&L men appear well-groomed?

The catalogue states that conventional dress consists of a
sport coat and slacks, or suit, with a shirt of subdued color.
Jeans, tennis shoes, and dark-colored shirts are not included
in this. If students themselves won’t take the responsibility of
maintaining a neat appearance, perhaps they could talk to
the Assimilation Committee and the EC about their problems.

Intramurals

Last week’s Tuesday Ring-tum Phi carried a letter to the
editor criticizing the paper for omitting intramural news. This
is indeed a valid criticism, for the intramural program is pos-
sibly one of the most worthwhile endeavors of the student body.

Since Washington and Lee operates on the basis of de-
emphasized intercollegiate athletics, the usual inter-school ti-
valry and school-wide interest is lacking at W&L. It is the role,
therefore, of the intramural program to promote healthy ath-
letic competition and school-wide relations.

In a lot of instances, the only contact members of one so-
cial fraternity have with those of another is on the intramural
field. Here a meeting ground is provided for healthy interaction
between students who share in common the University. Should
interest wane in the intramural program, the primary source
of common activity would be lost to the student body, and ir-
reparable damage would be done to what cohesiveness now

exists at W&L.

We apologize for our omission, and shall strive in the
future to give intramural news its due.

 

‘Taste of Honey’
Communicates
Poignancy, Wit

By TOM PACE

Anything that Walt Disney does
has a certain unmistakable touch
to it.

Whether that touch is heavy or
deft is often debatable. Another time
around will no doubt begin after
“Son of Flubber” has come and
gone. It arrives next Sunday at
the State Theatre, and like its fath-
er, “The Absent-Minded Professor,”
stars Fred MacMurray.

A Taste of Honey

While on touches, Tony Richard-
son deserves mention.

He is the director of “Taste of
Honey” which starts at the Lyric
Sunday. He is not stylistic as are

Antonioni (L’Avventura), Kubrick | |
(Lolita), and Truffaut (The 400]!
Blows).

Instead, he seems to be more

graphic, more real, but unfortunate-
ly, more plodding. To be sure,
“Taste of Honey” is a fine movie. It
concerns a six-month interval in a
young girl’s life. The young girl’s
name is Jo and the six months are
very important ones in her life.

She begins by running away from
school and home (accompanied by
her mother) and runs throughout
the film. While running, she loses
her mother to a man who doesn’t
want Jo, has her first love affair, be-
comes pregnant, lets a homosexual
move in with her, and regains her
mother just when she probably has
no need for her.

Humor and Poignancy

It is a moving story based on a
play by Shelagh Delaney. The mov-
ie retains its humor and poignancy,
and the dialogue is refreshing in its
simplicity. With all forms of art,
however, the interests should lie in
how the story is told.

Richardson is able to make every-
thing seem real. It often appears
that he is taking you with him to
film what is actually happening. His
setting (the places, the people, the
noises) are done with utmost care
to preserve the aura of authenticity.
His camera plays no tricks. It makes
you an observer without and yet
within his simple reality.

Richardson’s actors drive his point
home. None are attractive in ap-
pearance. They look like people you
see everyday. They are real. And
they are good.

Rita Tushingham As Jo

Rita Tushingham’s performance as
Jo is a rarity. She is moving and
warm in the role, affecting emo-
tions and expressions expertly. The
mother (Dora Bryan) received the
British Academy Award, which she
deserved, for her performance.

Perhaps, though, Murray Melvin
does the finest work in his por-
trayal of the homosexual. He is al-
ways in accord with the nature of
the character.

Much credit is due Miss Delaney’s
play. Equal credit is due the actors.
However, the director is solely re-
sponsible for a film’s total result. He
must photograph, cut, edit, fix his
settings, instruct his actors, and
approve everything that goes on the
screen,

Therefore most credit for the
movie’s excellence must go to Rich-
ardson. He is able to achieve plain
authenticity with no pretenses, no
embellishments. Paradoxically, his
strength is also his weakness. He
forgets that art is more than bare
imitation of reality. His lack of pol-
ish and refinement prevent his film
from reaching the greatness which
the films mentioned above did.

Radical Political Leaders Talk At UVa.

By BILL ATWELL

Since the beginning of February,
two incidents have caused a mild
furor in Virginia.

These two were the talks delivered
at the University of Virginia by Sec-
retary of the American Communist
Party Gus Hall and by the self-
styled commander of the American
Nazi Party, George Lincoln Rock-
well.

Hall and Rockwell were invited to
speak by the University’s John Ran-
dolph Society for the purpose of in-
forming students “of the threat
posed by the philosophies which
they represent.”

When the talks were first propos-
ed, reactions were varied. Govern-
or Harrison, the Richmond Times-
Dispatch and the American Legion
were flatly opposed to bringing the
men to U.Va.

State Commander of the Ameri-

truth, and more important, they
must realize that academic freedom

The Peril Of

By JOHN KIRKLEY

One hears much today about Eu-
ropean decadence, exploding popu-
lation, creeping materialism, and the
rise of mass-society. Each of these
generalizations can be supported by
credible evidence and all are con-
temporary phenomena _ resulting
from approximately the same causes,
which tend to support one another.

During the Renaissance the mind
of man became curiously aware of

 

its environment after a period of lat-
ency during the Middle Ages. Mental
and geographical horizons expanded
during the 15th and 16th centuries.
Nations were born; new continents
were founded and settled; scientists
began once again to unfold the won-
ders of nature.

Wealth of New Developments
International trade developed;

of speech was never intended to be-
come an instrument of our own de-
struction.”

University officials, the Roanoke
Times and the Richmond News-
Leader were more realistic, al-
though hardly enthusiastic, in the
matter.

The News-Leader said, “If the
fire-breathing alumni and the out-
raged Legionnaires will only simmer
down, this unfortunate affair can
be kept from boiling over. It was
poor judgment on the students’ part
to invite this pair, but the making
of judgments is an essential part of
the educative process; inevitably
some wrong judgments must be
made. The University administration
has played its hand with cool re-
straint. Let us leave it now in the
hands of the student body.

“Our guess is that the sophisti-
cated young gentlemen of the Uni-
versity of Virginia will be more
amused than impressed, more curi-
ous than corrupted.”

Let us now turn to the talks them-
selves.

Hall spoke Feb. 28th and Rock-
well Fed. 14th. Both faced capacity

 

audiences at the University’s Cabell
Hall auditorium, more than 500
students being turned away from the
talks.

Trend Toward a Closed Society

Hall spoke mainly against the an-
ti-subversive McCarran Act's regis-
tration law. He said the law came
out of “the hysteria of the McCar-
thy days,” and resulted from “trends
in this land toward a closed society.”

He said, also, that “Capitalism has
reached its peak and has now de-
clined to the point where it and
communism are more or less on an
equal basis.”

The Hall talk was rather unevent-
ful and in the words of one U.Va.
student, “uninteresting and even
dull.”

Rockwell was something of a sur-
prise in his conduct. He spoke in a
conservative blue suit instead of a
storm trooper’s uniform, and man-
aged to avoid much yelling. A stu-
dent commented, “He looks like my
father.”

The U.S. Nazi's opening words set
the tone of his whole speech:

strange products and vast stores of
wealth were revealed. The religious
teachings of Calvin, Luther, and
others during the Reformation con-
tributed to the formation of a Pro-
testant ethic, as Weber calls it,
which aided and supported the rise
of the industrial - entrepreneural
economy of the Western world.

The development of the profit mo-
tive and of competition encouraged
the growth and expansion of new
means of production and distribu-
tion—automation, factories, mass-
production, automobiles, trucks,
trains, steamships. And from the
sweat, filth, and tears of the indus-
trial revolution urbanism as a way
of life began to grow: people started
to move from the country to the city
to supply labor for production; and
national economies became primar-

 

ily industrial rather than agricultur-
al.
‘Age of Plentitude’

All of these trends came to a head
and produced a crisis in 19th Cen-
tury Europe. According to Ortega
y Gasset, Spanish philosopher,
teacher, and statesman, the 19th cen-
tury was an age of “plentitude,” an
age of superabundance which re-
garded itself as the high-point, the
culmination of historical develop-
ment. Men of the 19th century
thought that, in the future, the world
would remain essentially as it was
but “progress” would continue in-
definitely.

But three trends began during the
19th century which have changed
the face of the world and altered
completely the condition of man-

Britain and the European Common Market: DeGaulle’s Position

By BILL NOELL
and ED NORTON

When, on January 29, 1963, Brit-
ain’s bid to enter the Common Mar-
ket collapsed as a result of steady
and dogged Freneh opposition, the
European Economie Community re-
ceived a major set-back—one of the
first since its formal inception in
1957. As the Wall Street Journel, of
January 30, 1963, suggested, “The
Kennedy Administration was with-
out a good fall-back position, and
now finds itself lacking any clearly
charted course to cope with Brit-
ain’s exclusion....” Indeed, the ad-
ministration on all levels has re-
mained significantly silent on the
entire action, in view of the fact
that the predicted success of Presi-
dent Kennedy’s New Trade Expan-
sion Act was largely contingent on
Britain’s entrance into the E.E.C.
For there to be the substantial tariff
reduction, which the act makes pos-
sible, the United States and the
country or bloc of countries with
which it is negotiating must account

 

for production of more than 80 per
cent of the total free world output
in the particular good or goods in
question. A Common Market with-
out Great Britain will therefore be
unable to receive as proportionally
great reductions as the act had first
envisioned.
Action Favorable to U.S.?

Nonetheless, some trade experts
have asserted that de Gaulle’s ac-
tion may prove beneficial to the
United States. The basic assumption
underlying such an optimistic theory
is that an economically divided Eu-
rope will tend to shy away from
protectionism. Britain, now unable
to sell satisfactorily in the Common
Market may negotiate more vigor-
ously for reciprocal trade agree-
ments with this country. The ar-
gument continues that the six mem-
bers of the existing Economic Com-
munity, denied access to British
markets, may themselves look to the
United States for trade concessions
granted on a reciprocal basis. Such
a position in our view is not credi-

 

ble, as the EEC’s France has no de-
sire to increase its dependence on
the United States, and the degree of
satisfaction, which the members of
such a trisected trading group would
feel in contrast to the visions in-
voked by the Rome Treaty, would
be pale at best. Moreover, such an
outlook is further untenable in con-
sideration of the other and some-
what bleaker alternatives open to
all the parties.
Alternative: Protectionism

The
the Common Market is one of almost
The Wall
Street Journal has speculated as fol-
lows: “France has already made it
clear that it wants Common Market
agriculture walled off from outside
competition; does it really feel dif-
ferent about industry? One can
readily imagine deGaulle’s permit-
ting prolonged trade negotiations
with the United States, just as he
permitted prolonged entry talks with
Britain—but if they show signs of

complete protectionism.

yielding fruit, will he not be equally
brutal at chopping them off at the
roots?” Though Britain will un-
doubtedly have a sincere nationalis-
tic interest in any movement toward
freer trade, what influence it can
bring to bear on other nations, it-
self being a Common Market reject,
is certainly in doubt. Though sever-
al of the Common Market countries,
because of military associations with
the United States would most prob-
ably not greet with unbounded en-
thusiasm a_ protectionist policy,
which seemed to discriminate against
this country, the obligations created
by the Rome Treaty regarding the
formation of a common external
tariff must surely be expected to
prevail, and to preclude the possi-
bility toward any single nation no
matter how compelling a military
reason might dictate otherwise.

To Create a United Europe

Yet a second and more disturbing
alternative is the one which lies in
the hands of France, herself. It is

 

apparent that de Gaulle’s ultimate

 

objective is to create a united Eur-
ope, at the head of which would be
France—a union which could be sig-
nificantly less dependent on the
United States, and less subject to her
influences. To that end, he is desir-
ous of equipping France with a
deterrent nuclear capability of her
own, despite the tremendous econ-
omic sacrifices that such an effort
will entail. That policy stands dia-
metrically opposed to what the press
has termed “President Kennedy’s
Grand Design”—a multilateral nu-
clear force in which the United
States would retain the elements of
leadership. Some Western diplomats
have even expressed serious concern
that de Gaulle may attempt to ne-
gotiate an independent settlement
with Moscow, hoping to act as a buf-
fer between East and West.

One Man’s Stubbornness
Thus, Europe’s move toward uni-
ty, which began somewhat informal-
ly following the Second World War,
progressing at a rate which has sur-
prised even its most optimistic sup-

 

porters, has been temporarily block-
ed by the stubbornness of one man.
While this unity found its basis
in the economics which were to be
derived from an increasingly large

market area, its ultimate goals
are political, and its architects
envision that the member nations
will greatly be drawn into some
form of supernational European
government. As Walter Hallstein,

the chairman of the E.E.C.’s Coun-
cil of Ministers succinctly put it,
“We are not in business, we are in
politics.” de Gaulle himself fav-
ors a united Europe, but on terms
which should prove unacceptable
to the other members—France must
be the prominent partner. Unlike the
postwar generation of statesmen who
tend to think of themselves not as
Italians, Germans, or Frenchmen, but
as Europeans, de Gaulle remains in
his own mind, France’s appointed
one, introspective and intensely na-
tionalistic. To him, “France is not
herself unless in the front rank. ...

Added Depth, Experience
Makes Grid Picture Bright

By JOHN ALLGOOD
Sports Editor

How does a football coach im-
prove an 8-1 record achieved dur-
ing a “rebuilding year?”

If anyone can answer that ques-
tion, it is Washington and Lee Uni-
versity’s head football coach, Lee
McLaughlin. But even the smiling
W&L boss is not quite sure how to
go bettering his 1962 8-1 mark.

1963 OUTLOOK—"We'll be improved.”
ON GUARDS—"A coach’s dream.”

ON WEATHER—"“‘Sweet are uses of adversity.”
ON OPPONENTS—“They’ll be improved.”
ON ATTITUDE—‘We're just tickled pink.”

  

“We'll definitely be improved this
year,’ MeLaughlin said as he watch-

ed his boys in Spring drills. “But

we're playing a much _ tougher

schedule with the addition of Sus-|

quehanna, Oberlin and Washington
University of St. Louis. The rest of
our opponents also are improved.”
If Spring practice is any indica-
tion, MeLaughlin is right about one
thing—his boys will be improved.

3 New Clubs
To Grid Slate

Washington and Lee University’s
Generals will meet nine opponents
in football this fall including the
four other members of the year-old
College Athletic Conference.

The W&L schedule was announc-
ed Saturday by Athletic Director E.
P. “Cy” Twombly. Four home con-
tests and two new opponents are in-
cluded in the 1963 listing.

New Foes

Newcomers to the Washington and
Lee schedule are Oberlin College
of Oberlin, Ohio, and Susquehanna
College of Selingsgrove, Pa. Return-
ing to the schedule after a one-year
absence is Washington University of
St. Louis, the newest member of the
College Athletic Conference.

Oberlin, Susquehanna and Wash-
ington replace Emory and Henry,
Lebanon Valley and Johns Hopkins
from the 1962 schedule.

The first conference game for
W&L will be against Centre College
and it will be a home contest for the
Generals. The last three games on
the new W&L schedule will be with
the remaining CAC members.

The 1963 W&L schedule:

Sept. 28, Randolph-Macon, home;
Oct. 5, Obelin, home; Oct. 12, Cen-
tre, home; Oct. 19, Susquehanna,
away; Oct. ..26, Hampden-Sydney,
away; Nov. 2 Franklin and Mar-
shall, away; Nov. 9, Sewanee, away;
Nov. 16, Southwestern, home; and

More Depth

More depth—McLaughlin welcom-

ed 63 to Spring drills—and a vastly-
improved third team will make the
Generals considerably tougher this
Fall.
W&L has good depth at every spot
except tackle and end. McLaughlin
figures his hardest job will be “try-
ing to select a starting eleven.”

The backfield is particularly over-
flowing with talent.

Leading 1962 ground _ gainers
Stuart Yoffe (482 yards), Skip Chase
(269 yards) and Henry Sackett (167
yards) plus three other veterans are

some

returning at the halfback spots.
Joining them are three promising
rising sophomores—Billy Andrews,

a former Roanoke Catholic Star—
Harry Brookby and Dick Prezzano.

Missing from the backfield this
Fall will be fullback Tommy Keesee,
who tied for Virginia scoring honors
and won berths on the Virginia All-
Small College and All College Ath-
letic Conference teams. Three cap-
able replacements are ready to step
into Keesee’s shoes, though. Rising
senior Syd Butler, rising junior Dan
Manson and rising sophomore John

é gel,
| Davenport

Anthony are scrapping for the start-
ing nod.

Quarterback Solid

The quarterback spot will be well
manned by John McDaniel, A. J.
Barranco, Brice Gamber, Doug Da-
vis, Gordon Gay and Larry Craig.

In the line, there is an abundance
of guards, so many that they’re
causing a “problem” for McLaugh-
lin.

McLaughlin has three returning
varsity stars for guards in Bill An-
George Gossman and Steve
plus two outstanding
freshmen (Jay Bowersox and Joe
Miller) and eight other promising
varsity and freshman players.

Frosh Prospects

Center, W&L’'s chief worry last
Spring, is well fortified with re-
turning starter Mike Sheffey and
a pair of freshmen—Jim Crothers
and Jeff Novinger—both of whom
McLaughlin feels have “an amaz-
ing amount of ability both offensive-
ly and defensively.”

Tackle boasts numbers, but is
short on experience. After Jim Syl-
vester, Bob Henley and Bill Skinner,
the Generals lack men who have
been tested under fire.

End Strong

The Generals’ end situation would
please most any coach, at least at
first glance. Returning are a_ pair
of all-conference selections—Buck
Ogilvie and John Madison—and a
third man, Mike Jenkins, who also
deserves a lot of credit. All will be
seniors.

“Jenkins is the hardest working
boy in Spring drills,’ McLaughlin
noted. “I’m going to have a real
tough time picking two starters from
those three.”

Behind those three, the Generals
don’t have many experienced men.

McLaughlin’s overall outlook is a
bright one. His teams have chalked
up a 25-1-1 record over the last
three seasons, and this Fall he’s con-
fident his boys will be improved.”

Washington and Lee and the Uni-
versity of Virginia proved that they
had Virginia’s top two wrestling
teams in a close-fought battle Mon-
day night in Doremus Gymnasium.
The Cavaliers, trailing 8-2 after
the first three matches, proceeded to
eke out a pair of one-point decis-
ions, a three-point win, and a four-
point triumph to salt away the
match.

Both teams wound up their dual
meet competition with 8-2 record.
For W&L it was the General’s best
season since 1949. The Generals got
their eighth win Friday with a 16-14
decision over West Virginia at Mor-
gantown.

“T’'m proud of every boy on our
team.” said W&L coach Dick Miller.
“They all wrestled well Monday
night and we've had a great year.”

Pete Winfield, the General’s 157-
pounder saw his undefeated string
vanish in the night’s most evenly
fought match. Virginia’s Alex Wells
scored a two-point takedown in the
first period and Winfield managed a
one-point escape in the second peri-
od. That‘s how the match ended.

he is striding into the market place,

here is the danger: the mass-man

lands, thus thwarting the attempt to
appeal made by Elmire and Orgon’s
excellent friend Cleante (Andy
Leonard). Orgon admits his error
and bemoans his credulity, but is
trapped by circumstances and _ his
own family.

Cleante urges Orgon to flee until
the matter is settled, and Valere has
prepared a carriage for the escape;
the doors are thrown open to allow
a hasty exit, and there stands—
Tartuffe! With him is an armed
guard from the palace, come to se-
cure the arrest of Orgon and in-
sure the removal of his family and
belongings from the very house he
has given to the imposter.

Is there no justice in the world?
Will not imposters, liars, rascals,

foolishly? The curtain rises tomor-

Faculty-Student Conference

To Discuss Ways Of Fraternity Improvement

Phillip Deane
Delivers Talk
On US And UN

Last Tuesday night Phillip Deane,
director of the United Nations In-
formation Center in Washington, told
some 75 students that the United
Nations “does not look toward a
world government.”

Mr. Deane, speaking under the
visiting scholars program of the
University Center in Virginia, lec-
tured in duPont Auditorium for
more than 90 minutes.

He stated that the U.N.’s_ pur-
pose is three-fold: (1) to serve
as a permanent peace conference,
(2) to aet as an economic consult-
ant to the world, and (3) to be
the “picker-up of messes.” In an
analogy he said, “If the world is
an apartment house, we are the
janitor.” The U.N. cleans the stairs,
keeps the fire regulations, and
helps when requested to do so.

The U.N.’s function as a peace
conference is, according to Deane,
necessitated by the need for a per-
manent club where enemies can
meet. He stated that the U.S. and
the U.S.R.R. have already tacitly
agreed that war is useless because
there would be no victors in World
War III, and that we are now only
quibbling about the wording of the
agreement. The role of the U.N. in
the negotiations is to keep the lines
of communication open.

In its role of economic consult-
ant Deane stated that the United
Nations “is in the business of help-
ing members who need help and
ask for it.” This aid is given, by
U.S. precedent, without regard to
the political situation in the re-
cipient country, and without po-
litical strings. Thus, he noted, the
U.N. special fund for agricultural
aid to Cuba is entirely in keeping
with this established policy. U.S.
objections to the fund are based
on the dubious opinion that pres-
ent conditions in Cuba are not
suitable for the agricultural diver-
sification program requested. In
giving aid to needy members, the
U.N. is avoiding situations of hope-
less poverty which lead to war.

As an example of the U.N. as a
“picker-up of messes,” Deane pointed
to the Congo crisis. He noted that no
one country could have carried out
the operation at less expense to it-
self, and that the use of the U.N.
in the Congo prevented an East-West
confrontation on the issue.

Dr. Jones, John Dunnell Praised
For Performance Of ‘Tartuffe’

By C. C. FLIPPEN -
Executive Editor

“Tartuffe” as performed by the
Troubadours is one of the most
polished and graceful plays ever
produced here.

The Moliere comedy of hypocisy
moves swiftly and smoothly over
showing what fools we humans are.

Directors

Directors Dr. Cecil Jones and sen-
ior Andy Adelson have given the
play a comic finesse which makes
it both a pleasure to the eye and
the comic sense.

The play itself is, of course, about
the raising of Tartuffe from the gut-
ter to a high position in the house-
hold of Monsieur Orgon. Through
his hypocritical piety, Tartuffe is
eventually able to gain such a hold
over Orgon that he is in a position
to destroy him.

Jones in Lead

Jones appears in the title role of
Tartuffe. His professional ability
is apparent from the moment he

Leonard) make his point in this week’s

eated is Orgon, portrayed by John Dunnell.

 

takes the stage. In fact during the
Prologue his brief appearance vir-
tually steals that scene. As Tartuffe
he is appropriately lascivious, self-
assured and pseudo-religious. He is
completely convincing in the role.

Dunnell

John Dunnell in the role of Or-
gon gives one of his best perform-
ances here. As the over-zealous,
deluded patron of Tartuffe, he works
himself into a real frenzy when any-
one questions his devotion to Tar-
tuffe. He tops all frenzies, however,
when he discovers that he has been
fooled.

As Elmire, Orgon’s wife, Susan
Dunnell is charming. She moves
with all the grace and beauty one
associates with a lady of that period.
Regrettably her voice proves at times
too weak to cope with a rattling
heater in the rear of the theatre.

Leonard as Cleante

Andy Leonard as Cleante, Elmire’s
brother, gives us a splendid portrait
of “right reason above all.” Over-
flowing with truth and reason from
the moment he takes the stage, he
too proves ineffectual before the
hypocrite.

 

Lisa Tracy

In the role of Dorine the maid, |
Lisa Tracy brings to life one of the |
most spritly, sharp-tongued maids'

who ever befuddled her master. With
a deft touch, she creates some of the
funniest scenes in the play.

Supports

The supporting roles are all well
performed. Carolyn Bing, as Madame
Pernelle, Orgon’s mother, saves the
opening scene of the play from what
could be a slow start with her
crochity performance.

Charlie Bright, as Orgon’s son,
is a very lould-mouthed hot head,
who sounds as though he has spent
much time in Southern France.
George Chapman and Betsy Letcher
are attractive as lovers, though far
from ardent.

Pretty little Kendall Jamison as
another maid, appears but briefly
and has even less to say, but her
face, which would light up any
stage, makes that appearance worth-
while.

It took a cold (and we mean
physically) opening night audience
quite a while to warm up for the
play. And this is our only real com-
plaint. It would seem that some-
thing could be done to heat the
theatre more effiiciently and quietly.

The third performance of the show
will be given at 8:30 tonight. To-
morrow there will be a 3 p.m. mat-
inee and the final performance at
8:30 p.m. Reservations may be made
by calling the Troubadour Theatre.

Kyger Conducts ‘Fruitful’

a - Forum On Frat Problems

By KEN LANE
Assistant Managing Editor

Can fraternities play a role in raising our academic stand-
ards? Should there be a deferred rush? Can the fraternities
be used to increase the loyalty of the student body to the

university?
These were some of the questions brought out in a faculty-
————=——Kstudent conference held at the
Hotel Robert E. Lee Wednesday

ODK Reviews
Problems Of
Visiting Students

The Alpha Circle of Omicron Delta
Kappa of Washington and Lee met
on Tuesday afternoon to discuss the
foreign student and his place on
the W&L campus. Erik Berg, ex-
change student from Norway and
Raimondo Starssoldo from Italy were
on hand for the discussion.

Both foreign students felt that an
exchange student’s stay on the W&L
campus wouldbe more meaningful
if the students were to stay in a
fraternity house for a longer period
of time, possibly for the entire school
year.

The IFC will bring this matter
up at a later date and attempt to
see what arrangements can be
made.

In conjunction with the current
interest in the role of the foreign
student at the American University,
a report from the Committee on
Foreign Students in the American
colleges and universities felt that
a revision in the program is needed.

Leading educators today endorse
a call for U.S. colleges and uni-
versities to re-examine the philoso-
phy, objectives and operation of their
foreign student programs.

The Committee on the Foreign
Student in American Colleges and
Universities issued a 26-page report
telling the schools that they must,
among other things, spend more
money, cooperate more closely with
governments and agencies which
sponsor such ustdents, and place in-
ternational education “into its prop-
er perspective” as a basic and es-
sential part of their educational mis-
sion.

The recommendations grew out of
several recent studies of the foreign
student situation, such as the Hig-
bee report (“The Status of Foreign
Student Advising in United States
Universities and Colleges,” by Hom-
er D. Hifibee of Michigan State Uni-
versity), which defined the inade-
quacies of foreign student programs
in nearly 2,000 institutions which
now enroll foreign students.

The urgency of need to improve
foreign student programs is under-
lined by the recent increase in the
number of such students, the Com-
mittee stresses.

 

night, under the sponsorship of the
Interfraternity Council.

Ross Kyger, president of the IFC,
stated that the purpose of the con-
ference was to strengthen the liai-
son between the faculty and stu-
dents, and to coordinate an exchage
of ideas about ways of improving the
fraternity system at Washington and
Lee.

In his preliminary remarks at the
conference banquet, Kyger discussed
the critical conditions of the frater-
nity system before an assembly of
sixty-six students and faculty mem-
bers. He emphasized the need for
fraternities to adjust to the new
“era” of rising academic standards.

The conference divided into six
discussion groups, each assigned
with specific topics. The topics in-
cluded such issues as deferred rush,
the assimilation of the non-fraternity
men into the university, and ways
to improve the scholastic standards.

“We were extremely pleased with
the results of the discussions,” Kyger
remarked, “and we feel that we
have arrived at some very concrete
ideas. Suggestions made at the con-
ference will be compiled and studied
by the IFC.”

The discussions centered principal-
ly on scholarship. Proposals were
made to have visiting speakers in the
fraternity houses, to invite faculty
members for discussion sessions, and
to establish in each fraternity a
house “honor roll.”

In addition, the problem of assim-
ilating non-fraternity students into
the university was discussed. In-
cluded in the suggestions to imple-
ment this goal were the possibilities
of a formal second semester rush
for nonfraternity students, and of
inviting more independent students
to meals and parties in the frater-
nity houses.

Among the more controversial is-
sues discussed was that of deferred
rush. “We could make little progress
with this matter,” Kyger commented.
“The idea of second semester rush
was not found entirely unfeasible,
but yet studies of other colleges
produce no concrete support for
changing the present system.”

The pledging program also came
under discussion. A proposal was
made for having an IFC guidebook
for setting up the goals of pledging
and establishing specifie ways to
achieve them. It was further suggest-
ed to abolish all forms of hazing
and place full emphasis on scholar-
ship and extracuricular activities
Also studied was the problem of

Isolation

Immersed as we are in the

academic community of Wash-

ington and Lee, it is easy to forget how peculiarly isolated we
are, and how much this isolation bears on our situation. We are
isolated geographically, surrounded by mountains and located

in a remote section of Virginia.

More important, we are isolated

by the very nature of our institution, compounded by its size

and traditions.

This is as it should be. The chance to be free of worldly
pressures gives the student time to form his character and
ideals. This is in the best tradition of Liberal Education. Here
an individual is free to come in contact with the best of Man’s
aspirations and to learn what he might become.

But with this isolation come responsibilities which we
often—perhaps too often—neglect. That we should be free
from worldly pressures does not mean that we should be ignor-

ant of the world. A moment's

reflection will show how often

we do allow our isolation to become a barrier rather than a pro-

tection.
This need not be the case.

Programs such as International

Relations Week provide us with an opportunity to stay in the
mainstream of world affairs, current thought, and contemporary
approaches. We owe it to ourselves to take advantage of these

opportunities to avoid misusing

 

our isolation.

Waysiders Bring Live Folk Music
To Lexington ‘Just For Fun’

Customers who have walked into
the back room of the College Inn
during recent Friday nights have
found a pleasant addition to their
beer and Mutzies in the form of a
couple of folk singers providing
entertainment. The lights are dim-
med and a spotlight illuminates a
small stage with a black backdrop.
The manager of the duo steps up
to introduce them as “the slowest
rising young folk singers in Amer-
ica,’ and the audience welcomes
them onto the stage enthusiasticaly.

The audience comes to listen, and
it is rewarded with a wide range of
entertainment, from  fast-driving
spirituals to soft blues. As the eve-
ning progresses, only standing room
is left and people sit on the pool
table and the floor.

“Just for Fun”

Known as the Waysiders, Dave
Trussel and Jim Ledbetter began
singing together a few months ago
“just for fun.” That they enjoy sing-
ing is evident to the most casual
spectator, and they try to retain as
much informality on the stage as
they do at their practice sessions.
Hunter Manson, now their busi-
ness manager, approached them with
the possibility of job opportunities
and arranged an audition at the
College Inn and a job at Southern
Seminary. They were so well re-
ceived that they were offered a
regular job at the College Inn on

Friday nights. During the recent
George Washington holiday, they
sang at the Blue Dog Cellar in Bal-
timore, where they have been offered
a summer job.

Song-Writing

Most of the songs that the boys
sing are a result of their own re-
search. “We get more pleasure out
of singing our own songs,” Dave
says, “and there are hundreds of
good folk songs that the current
craze has not brought to light that
we think are worthy of our atten-
tion. However, we are never afraid
to sing some one else’s song if we like
it.” Some of their songs they have
written themselves.

One attractive feature about the
Friday night shows is that there
is no admission. “We want to keep
it this way,” says Jim. “We feel that
Lexington is so devoid of entertain-
ment that something of this type is
needed, and we want everybody to
be able to come and have a good
time.”

Meaning Behind Them

The songs that they sing are in-
teresting in themselves. “The Bells
of Rhymney” and “Springfield Mine
Disaster” are both mining songs
dealing with the tragedy that often
arises from that type of life. “Makes
a Long Time Man Feel Bad” is a
folk blues that comes from prison
inmates, and “Come on Down the
Riggin’” is an original composition
that captures the spirit of the old
sea chanties. They sing many more,
to which they are constantly adding
and changing in order to capture the
feeling of their songs.

“Get the Message”

“What we enjoy about singing at
the College Inn,” says Jim, “is the
feeling we get that the audience has
come to listen to our songs and try
to get the message we want to put
across.” They also enjoy singing hu-

Denton Reports On Mardi Gras:
Makes W&L Weekends Tame?

By NICK DENTON

It was a wild Mardi Gras to be
sure, with hilarity, incongruity
glamour and burlesque riding high
in the saddle.

The only thing to rival the bright-
ness of the sunshine were the glitter-
ing parades and colorful spectators—
over four million of them—who
somehow managed to jam _ them-
selves into some twenty-five square
blocks of New Orleans’ fabulous
French Quarter. From the air it
must have looked like a giant pizza
pie, but down below, the teeming
masses laughed and sang, pushed
and pulled with unbridled revelry
for a continuous one hundred and
twenty hours over every inch of
the streets.

It seemed like everybody in the
world must have met daily at
Canal and Royal Streets for the
parades, turning the showplace
into a mammoth sardine can, But
as packed as it was, an equal
number of people were celebrating
just as hard by jamming St.
Charles, Bourbon, St. Claude, and
Poydras Streets.

What were they celebrating so
frantically? In the words of Rex,
mythical Lord of Misrule, Monarch
of Merriment, and King of Mardi
Gras: “A fig for care!” In other
words, raise hell...and raise it high
and as long as you possibly can. A
wonderful tradition, this, and people
from all over the world have prac-
ticed it each February since 1872.

One particular bar off Bourbon
Street—Pat O'’Brians—seemed to
be the nucleus for all this mad-
ness, and so that is where this re-
porter took a stand. From Friday
through Tuesday nothing better
typifies the festivities than beer,
blood and barf. Everyone had a
can of beer (30c) from one of the
many stands which dotted the
streets, or a “Volcano” glass from
Pat O’Brians, The glasses were
kept as souvenirs or cashed in for
a dollar, but the cans—tens of
thousands of them—were littered
with glee. After a while one could
stand still and almost be rolled
down Bourbon Street! It only
went to prove once again the local
title for Mardi Gras crowds as the
“Beercanderthal Civilization.”

There was at least one parade
every day, topped off on Tuesday
night by those of Rex and Comus. In
all there were some three hundred
floats and an equal number of bands,
and marching or riding units.
Stretching in what seemed a never-
ending line, parades depicted such
themes as “Fantasy of the Sea,”
“Gulliver’s Travels,” “The World of
Mark Twain,” “King Arthur's
Court,” “Egypt,” and almost every
other subject.

Plumed horsemen, motorcycle
police and = sirened trucks  sur-
rounded the parades to keep back
the masses who fought for the
little rubber and plastic favors as

Controversial

Speakers Should
Talk On Campus

By PETE ALFORD
Friday Columnists

“I am here not to agitate. In-
stead I am here to express to you
what I believe in.”

—George Lincoln Rockwell

One subject which seems to occur
quite frequently on the editorial
pages of the Ring-tum Phi when
world shaking events are thin is the
choice of speakers which comes to
the Washington and Lee campus.

At the onset we would like to say
that many fine men from a variety of
fields have been invited to Lexington
and have addressed varying members
of our students and faculty. The
organizations which sponsor these
lectures should be commended and
they should be encouraged to con-
tinue their fine efforts.

Attendance, however, is poor at far
too many of these lectures and sem-
inars; and frequently the guest
speakers, though competent and in-
formative, are not the “headliners”
which, unfortunately, are needed to
attract sufficiently large numbers of
students.

In the last issue of the Ring-tum
Phi (Tuesday variety) a report was
printed concerning the speeches de-
livered at U.Va. by Communist Party
boss Gus Hall and American Natzi
Party Commander George Lincoln
Rockwell and the “mild furor” which
proceeded their appearances.

rather

if they were jewels. I observed
one woman scramble in the gutter
and bounce a small child away
with her sizable hip to retrieve
a string of beads. More color was
added by the lively “flambeaus,”
torch-waving Negroes who danced
about the various parade units
picking up pennies tossed by the
crowd.

A few of the marching units dis-
played precision, but simply rocked,
rolled, rambled—and reeled—along
the routes. What they lacked in co-
ordination they made up with orig-
inality, zest, spirits (very obviously)
and certainly bunions on their feet.
The more lively units were The
Jefferson City Buzzards, the Good
Time Jesters, The Algiers Spartans
Carnival Club, and The Half-Fast

 

Walking Club. Some of these march-
ers never reached the reviewing
stands. Known for their frequent
stops to reinforce and refresh, it is
possible that some of them were
either all tuckered out or were hav-
ing such a good time that they stayed
out of the downtown area. I can’t
help but think that some of them
never planned to pass the stands in
the first place.

Any other time it might be
scandalous the way the people
behaved—and in public at that.
But Mardi Gras week, nobody
blinked a disapproving eye at any-
thing. The New Orleans’ Police
Department did a wonderful job
of “unobtrusive restraint” consid-
ering the immense task of keeping
the parades rolling safely and

 

smoothly, lost children, drunks,
traflic jams, and various disturb-
ances and accidents.

Patrol wagons ran in regular shifts
carting off persons in custody par-
ticularly in the French Quarter, but
there was nothing to compare with
the Friday night brawl in front of—
where else?—Pat O’Brians. One per-
son was stabbed and everyone be-
gan throwing fists, beer cans, and all
else handy until the police charged
the growing mob with horses, dogs,
and hoses.

Throughout the weck only two
pedestrians were hit and there was
only one auto wreck anywhere near
Pat’s. This was mainly because most
of the autos were either carried
through or else covered with rebel-

Crowds throng Canal Street for New Orleans’ annual Mardi Gras to watch a parade and
drink beer from streetside booths. Throwing discretion to the winds, revelers don fancy dress
and relive a custom ninety-five years old.

 

Analysis Of The Federal Budget
Throws Light On “Tax Cut”

What is the most significant trend in the growing
expenditures of our Federal Government? Are non-
defense expenditures increasing faster than those for
defense production? Is the Government really holding
the line on nondefense spending, or is it proposing
more and more new programs every year?

Answers to these questions—and many others of
interest to taxpayers—are given by the Council of
State Chambers of Commerce in a critical analysis of
the Administration’s budget proposals for 1964. The
study was made in Washington by Eugene F. Rinta,

a noted fiscal analyst.

The “one truly heartening” feature in the
budget—the “recognition by President Kennedy
and his administration that... significant reduc-
tion of individual and corporate (tax) rates
is essential for the attainment of our (economic)
growth potential”—was to be jeopardized by the

size of the budget itself.

The expenditure estimate for 1964 is $988 billion—
which exceeds the highest budget total during World
War II (the $98.3 billion total of fiscal 1945). The
total is $4.5 billion above the current estimates for
1963, and $11.0 billion above the 1962 fiscal year which

ended last June 30.

The Council analysis further notes that the
1964 expenditure total is 29 per cent above that
of 1960, the last full budget year of the previous
administration. That represents an annual in-
crease of $5.6 billion over the four years since

1960.

A cursory comparison of budget 1964 expenditures
by funetional categories with current estimates for
1963 might indicate that the Defense and Space pro-
grams account for the entire increase of $4.5 billion.
But the Rinta analysis discloses that many categories
of nondefense expenditures show a further rise in
spending beyond the sharp increase that have already

been effected since 1960.

1. The $1 billion drop anticipated in farm price
supports is largely accounted for by anticipated sub-
stantial sales in 1964 of cotton expected to be placed
under price support in the current year. Whether these
sales materialize remains to be seen.

2. An indicated reduction of $160 million in Rural
Electrification Administration and Farmers Home Ad-
ministration loan programs is almost wholly accounted
for by a bookkeeping device. A similar proposal was

“rejected by Congress last year.
3. A drop of $248 million in net postal service out-

lays is accounted for by a lower postal deficit due to

the full year effect in 1964 of postal rate increases
approved last year.

4. Foreign economic and technical assistance shows
a reduction of $145 million from 1963, but the fact is
that these activities are being expanded by $278 million,
or more than 10 per cent. The apparent net reduction

is due to an increase in net receipts of $423 billion

by the Export-Import Bank resulting in the main from
anticipated private sales of $540 million of loans it
holds in its portfolio. These sales may prove more
difficult in realization than in budgeting.

5. Expenditures for the conduct of foreign affairs
indicate a reduction of $50 million but this is more

than accounted for by the absence in 1964 of a one-

shot $100 million outlay for U.N. bonds in 1963.

6. A reduction of $250 million is shown for housing
and related programs but $150 million of this results
from an anticipated increase from $49 million to $199
million in private sales of housing mortgages held by

the Federal National Mortgage Association.

In those categories where a decrease was
shown, the analysis explained that some special
factor other than a curtailment of activities is

 

generally involved:

According to Mr. Rinta’s analysis, the fore-
going types of budget reductions would appear
a weak foundation on which to base increases
in other nondefense activities with the claim, as
stated in the President's budget message, that
expenditures for purposes other than defense,
space and interest are being held at the 1963

The analysis further pointed to a substantial in-
crease of Federal civilian personnel. In a period of
three years and five months to the projected end of
the 1964 budget year, the Council study noted that
the Kennedy Administration will have increased Fed-
eral civilian employment by more than 229,000.

What is the possibility of a tax cut in the light

of the spending situation? Analyst Rinta notes

 

 

that the President's tax program places primary
emphasis on rate reductions designed to increase
demand and, thus energize the economy. “In the

issue,” he explains, “the

President and his advisers take the position that
the Government will incur deficits the next few
years with or without tax reduction, but that the
budget will sooner be in balance with rising ex-
penditures if economic growth is encouraged by

rate reductions is so urgent

that rates should be cut promptly,” the Council study
concludes, “but expenditures should be controlled at
current levels. On this basis a balanced budget could
be expected within a year or two. Certainly this po-
sition is an attainable one if the Congress will only
give it a real try.

Wrestlers And Swimmers End Seasons

Georgetown

Falls 58-35

As Tankmen Finish 7-5

By NICK MONSARRAT
Assistant Sports Editor

The varsity swimming team settled
accounts with Georgetown Universi-
ty Thursday with a resounding 58-
35 victory, capturing seven first
places and setting their season rec-
ord at a final 7-5.

Wolfe Wins Twice

Perpetual double winner John
Wolfe once again scored twice in
sweeping the 200-yard and 500-yard
freestyle events. The Generals also
swept first places in the relay, the
50-yard freestyle, 200-yard individ-
ual medley, 200-yard backstroke,
and the 200-yard breaststroke.

 

In a season which saw the W&L
swimmers face four subsidized
teams, Maryland, East Carolina,
West Virginia, and Loyola College,
the victory over West Virginia is
to be especially noted. Excellent
performances by freshman John
Lifter and Bo Bokinsky added to
the final push made by the final
100-yard freestyle relay which
gave the Generals the final victory,
50-45. Maryland, East Carolina,
and Loyola accounted for three of
the five losses during the season.

A 62-32 opening season loss to a
greatly improved University of Vir-
ginia team offered the Generals a
hint of the toughness of the year’s
competition but after a resounding

 

Scoring leader Bo Bokinsky (left) and junior Walt Mc-
Manus on their way to the 200-yard butterfly. Bokinsky swam

the distance in record time this

victory over Roanoke College the
future looked brighter. But two loss-
es in Washington, D.C. the following
week to Lyola and American Uni- |
versity again seemed discouraging.

W&M Forfeits

The week before Christmas vaca-
tion William and Mary forfeited to
the Generals, protesting that W&L’s
use of freshman violated their own
principles of fair play. It is interest-
ing to note, however, that William
and Mary swam other schools this
year, all of which used freshmen.

Consecutive victories over Wake
Forest, Old Dominion, and Lynch-
burg College bolstered W&L's
courage for the pasting that was
expected when Maryland invaded
Lexington. In this meet the Gen-
erals’ times were good but Mary-
land's were far better, with six
pool records falling between the |
two teams.

At season’s end the Generals
managed a win over Georgetown
and a loss to a greatly bolstered
subsidized team from East Carolina.

Record Set |

In the course of the season six
Washington and Lee records were
set by the General swimmers. Fresh-
man John Lifter holds records in
the 200-yard individual medley and
the 200-yard backstroke. Sophomore
John Wolfe set records in the 200-
yard and 500-yard freestyle events.

year.

Freshman Bo Bokinsky, leading the
team in scoring, holds the record in
the 200-yard butterfly as well, while
the 400-yard freestyle relay team of
Casto, Captain Herb Jahncke, Mon-
sarrat, and Grant also hold top
honors in that event.

In view of the increasing tough-
ness of swimming competition Coach
Norris Eastman is to be commended
for a job well done.

This week’s sport star honor is
shared by two men who have
worked with dedication for the W&L
wrestling team for the past four
years. They are Jud Babcock and
Dick Albert.

During the past season both have
served as Tri-captains along with
Dave Montgomery, and as Coach
Miller says, “have served well and
have been an inspiration to
team.”

Coach Miller says that Albert and
Babcock have been good team men
and have always been willing to
move up a weight class for the good
of the team, rather than jumping

at the opportunity to wrestle smaller
men.

Jud Babcock has a record of 12-10-1|

Generals. This season his record was
4-5.

Most of Jud’s matches have been
in the heavyweight division, which
is quite a handicap for him in that
he normally weighs 175 pounds. In
most of his matches this season,
Babcock gave up 50 to 75 pounds
to his opponents and still managed
to turn out with a respectable rec-
ord.

Dick Albert has a four-year rec-
ord of 19-11-1. This year he had a

by one or two points. He led the

Best Season

By TOM DAY
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee matmen
finished their best season in four-
teen years last Tuesday even though
they lost to a tough University
of Virginia team 18-8. Not since
1949, when Ken Linley, Joe Sconce
and Ken Lindell thrilled the crowd
with their exhibitions has a W&L
team compiled such an impressive
record. Wrestling large schools as
Duke, Old Dominion and North Car-
olina State the W&L grapplers as-
tounded their opponents regularly
and finished the season with an 8-2
record.

The Generals were strong in every
position this year with nine letter-
men from the 1962 squad. With depth
and experience backing them up, the
matmen opened the 1962-63 season
against the Tar Heels of North
Carolina and soundly trounced them
19-8 with Tom Stover pinning his
opponents and West, Montgomery,
Reeves and Winfield gaining deci-
sions.

On December 3 ,the Generals
met a highly respected Old Do-
minion club. Overcoming an 11-0
deficit the big blue matmen went
on to upset their adversaries 17-
11. Four straight decisions by
Stover, Albert and Babcock gave
the Generals a 12-11 lead with
only the heavyweight match left.
Sam Block then wasted no time in
pinning Old Dominion’s Fred Bish-
op and clinching the match for
WEL.

Five days later the Generals
stretched their win streak to 3 by
completely trouncing Pfeiffer Col-
lege 26-6. In this match West,
Montgomery, Smith, and Babcock
pinned their opponents, and Stover
and Winfield gained decisions. Fol-
lowing the match the big blue set
out for the Chattanooga Invitation-
al tournament where the Generals
turned in fine performances.

On Jan. 12, the Generals traveled
to Washington, D.C. to meet Gal-
laudet College. The Washingtonians

Grapplers Wind Up 8-2;

Since 1949

proved no match for the strong
W&L team and went down to de-
feat in a 24-10 slaughter. This time
it was West, Montgomery, and Stov-
er’s turn to put on the show, and
that they did, each pinning his op-
ponent in less than four minutes.
Albert, Winfield, and Smith grabbed
decisions.

Then on February 16 the Gen-
erals win string was snapped by
an exceptionally tough Franklin
and Marshall team 19-12. Losing
three matches by bad breaks, the
Generals couldn't make up the
difference and lost a rough match,
The two bright spots of the eve-
ning came as Pete Winfield and
Jud Babcock pinned their oppon-
ents. With this victory Winfield
stretched his record to 7-0.

After defeating Hampden-Sydney
the wrestling team journeyed to West
Virginia to meet a tough Mountain-
er squad. Still smarting from their
previous defeat, the Generals whip-
ped W. Va. with Stover, Winfield,
and Montgomery gaining pins.

In the last match of the season,
the Generals met Virginia’s other
top team and dropped a tough one
to the Wahoos of U.Va. In _ this
match Pete Winfield lost an extreme-
ly close battle to Virginia’s Alex
Wells, 2-1. This ended his win streak
at seven. Starting out strong
ever, the big blue surged ahead 8-2
at the end of three matches. Then
due to some bad breaks, the Gen-
erals slipped away and_ couldn't
manage to pull it out of the fire.

Next year, Coach Miller faces the
tough job of rebuilding. With sen-
iors Montgomery, Babcock, and Al-
bert leaving there will be some big
holes to fill. Nevertheless, Coach
Miller has great confidence in the
boys that will move up from the
freshman squad and even hopes to
better this year’s 8-2 record.

The football squad and alumni
are anxiously awaiting the whistle
that will resume their annual clash
this Saturday at 2:30 p.m. on Wil-
son field.

yelling students who stole hubcaps,
raised heods, boured beer in win-
odws and built intricate can pyra-
mids on roofs.

The police and fire departments
answered over three hundred calls
a day and were congratulated by
Police Superintendent Joseph I.
Giarrusso “...for their tolerance
and devotion to duty under the most
trying conditions yet experienced.”

Shrove Tuesday was the most
trying day of all. Those people who
did not choose to stay up all night
began their drinking around seven
that morning and worked up a fev-
er pitch at the witching hour of
midnight. Most of the crowds wore
costumes depicting everything
from the Bay of Pigs invasion to
the glories of Ancient Greece. One
ingenious chap sprayed himself
green, rolled in “sparkle powder,”
and paraded about as a crab with
a large net over his head. There
were the usual supply of matadors,
gorillas, robots and men from
Mars, Also tramps, clowns, harem
girls, monsters and dozens of fe-
male impersonators.

A young girl was perfectly out-
fitted as a skunk, complete with high
arching tail and tight furry leotards.
One rather ugly tart of uncertain
age wore the mask of a beautiful
woman, and when the young men
(usually sailors) made overtures she
pulled back the mask to reveal her
rather unprepossessing features and
cackled: “Go home to your momma,
sonny!”

A half-dozen citizens = who
dressed as Alpine mountain climb-
ers got a kick out of climbing
over any car in their path, and
almost made it to a balcony where
the occupants were pelting them
with beer cans. A mounted police-
man cut their rope, however,
with the flourish of a Cossack
warrior.

Ten or twelve men blacked their
entire bodies and dressed in leopard
skins with boned wigs. Their signs
read “The Wa-Goosie Warriors” and
“We Gonna Enlist In Dat Ole’ Miss!”
The spears and shields they carried
protected them from any integra-
tion-mined spectators.

During the evening, one reveler
fell off a balcony and broke his
back. Fights were so common that
they usually ended before the po-
lice could get through the crowds,
and first-aid was rarely administered
if the person was still conscious.
The police wielded their billy clubs
far more sparingly than the bar-
tenders did their blackjacks, and
consequently bar floors all over the
Quarter were awash with beer,
blood and other liquids of various
colors and consistency. People slept

Food was almost forgotten since it
took away so much time from the
festivities. You lived on street corner
hot dogs, vitamin pills wheat germ
(if you had a date) and—of course—
alcohol. Even these had to be gulped
on the run since there was no place
nearby to sit unless you just plopped
in the middle of the street as many

did.

All around you maskers of every

prising distances. Apes climbed
phone poles, walking chandeliers
blinked on and off, and plumed
bird-women screamed as_ waist-
high hands rumpled their feathers.

All in all it was a fantastic time;
one which makes W&L’s parties
very meek in comparison. At mardi
Gras everyone is a stranger, and
there were almost no rules of con-
duct, and certainly no end to the
fun.

Of Radical Speakers And Ideas

only those things which you already
agree with can be of limited educa-
tional value. We must listen to men
with whose philosophy we don’t con-
cur and we must teach their ten-
ets in our schools if we are ever
going to be able to successfully de-
fend against them.

Considering the question under
discussion we do not propose that
Washington and Lee become a hot-
bed of radicalism, but that we
merely be exposed to speakers who
advocate measures other than the
ones we have heard all our lives.
This not only includes the fields of
politics, but also religion, economics,
race relations, and many others.

| TKA Debate Fraternity
Selects New Members

Tau Kappa Alpha, a national de-
bate fraternity, will soon admit five
new members from the Washington
and Lee student body Mr. William
Chaffin, forensic director, disclosed
this week. The five candidates are
Rick Kneipper, Jack Eure, Ed Nor-
ton, Malcolm Morris, and Steve
Smith.

To become eligible for Tau Kappa
Alpha a student must be in his sec-
ond year of active debating and must
be in the upper third of his class
academically.

During the past few weeks Wash-
ton and Lee’s debate teams have
turned in superlative performances
at both the University of South Car-
olina and at Richmond. Two week-
ends ago at the Camellia Tourna-
ment at Columbia, the Washington
and Lee team finished second. Jun-
ior Ed Norton led the team and
was chosen the second best speaker
at the tournament.

Norton’s affirmative colleague was
Ed Fitzgerald. Rick Kneipper and
Jack Eure comprising the negative
team. The Generals have a fine total
of nine wins and five losses.

Last weekend Mr. Chaffin took the
varsity team of Jack Eure and Jay
Clark and the novice team of Mike
Hayslip and Ed Fitzgerald to the
Richmond Invitational Tournament.
The freshmen performed especially
well, winning four of six rounds and
placing third in the novice division.

On February 19 the varsity debate
team staged a mock debate on the
question, “Resolved: the South
Should Have Won the Civil War.”
for a Rotary Club meeting at the
Robert E. Lee Hotel. Al Eckes and
Bill Boardman debated negative and
Jay Clarke and Bill Noell spoke on
the affirmative.

The next two weeks will be just
as active as the past two for Wash-
ington and Lee debaters. Eckes and
Noell left yesterday for a national
tournament to be held at Anapolis.
Reportedly some sixty schools will
be represented at this tournament

Westfel Group Initiates Two Series of Programs

The Westminster Fellowship of the Lexington Presbyterian Church has
initiated two series of programs recently. The first is a series of Frontier
Forums; the first, “You and the University” is being lead by Jere Cravens
and Dean E. C. Atwood, the second, “Word, World, and Sacrament” being
led by Jim Campbell and Rev. Warren Strickler, and the third, “The
Student in the Economic Order,” being lead by Pete Weaver and Mr. John
Gunn.

The second of these programs is one centered on Contemporary Chris-
tian Thought, featuring noted speakers on the Fundamentalist Movement,
and on the thoughts of Rheinhold Niebuhr, Paul Tillich and Dietrich Bon-
hoeffer. These two program series will be held in March and April.

Three additional concerts have
been lined up for the W&L glee
club on its Atlanta tour. The 52-
man organization, directed by Mr.
Robert Stewart, begins the tour
Thursday night and is scheduled to
give at least 4 and possibly 5 con-
certs before returning Sunday.

For at least one performance the
glee club can be assured a “cap-
tive’ audience. A concert has ben
arranged for Saturday evening in the
Atlanta Federal penitentiary. Seek-
ing to insure the audience remains
captive, the warden admonished glee
club president Sam Channel by
phone to caution the glee club mem-
bers not to bring in files, machine
guns or narcotics.

Also on the agenda for Saturday
afternoon and early evening are con-
certs at the veterans’ hospital and
Egleston Children’s Hospital. There is
a possibility of another performance,
but nothing definite has yet been
arranged.

The highlight of the trip is the
Friday night concert to be given
along with the Agnes Scott glee
club. The concert will follow supper
in the Agness Scott cafeteria at
which all club members will have
dates.

A major part of the Friday night
concert will be the performance of
Antonia Vivaldi’s Gloria mass for
mixed chorus. The mass takes ap-

A Timely Tribute

It is one of the unusual characteristics of Washington and
Lee that a student can give a great deal to the University while
getting his education. The new student body service award
should give needed emphasis to this fact and draw attention to
those students who are of service to their fellows and to future
students. Each time it is given it will honor not only a student
recipient, but at the same time a man the value of whose service
to this university cannot be expressed.

It wasn’t really necessary to name a scholarship after Dean
Frank J. Gilliam to ensure that his name will be remembered.
He is remembered by generations of Washington and Lee
students who will never learn about the Gilliam Award; and
his work will be felt at Washington and Lee by generations who
won’t fully know precisely why the award was given in his
name. But certainly no other name could be given this award
with the same fine meaning as that which Dean Gilliam’s gives
it. It is the custom to wait until a man has retired to give him
his due recognition; this time, the student body has been able
to give some small measure of honor to a man still at his desk
every day. No better choice could have been made.

Student Initiative For Programs

The inauguration at Randolph-Macon Woman’s College
of a student-initiated symposium on contemporary problems
allows Washington and Lee’s failure in this field to become
more noticeable. Randolph-Macon’s FOCUS has lined up an
impressive and interesting schedule of speakers and promises
to go a long way toward its goal: to “‘stimulate in the student a
greater concern and better understanding of current issues by
providing an opportunity for active participation and evalua-
tion.”” FOCUS has invited students from other schools, so
that the event will annually be an ‘Eastern and Southern”
affair, not a local one. While W&L has fine programs in its
International Relations Week, Glasgow and Religious speakers,
and others, a peak of stimulation is far away; these already
established are not enough, and must not be used as excuses to
stifle ideas for additional programs.

It is up to the student body, not the faculty, to take the
initiative in any new endeavor, as the girls down the road have
done. A suggestion: next year’s Mock Convention would be
an excellent time to launch a forum of student participation.
The Mock Convention has the prestige to attract prominent
speakers, and it arouses the interest to obtain tremendous stu-
dent cooperation. And it could be greatly improved by adding
to the political rallies, conventioning, and beerfests, such a
student forum as Randolph-Macon will open next weekend.

If anything at all is to be added to Washington and Lee’s
agenda for next year, it must be begun now. Speakers for next
year must be invited this spring; next year will be too late to

get the best.

A Poor First Impression

Every freshman who pledges a Red Square fraternity learns
immediately that it is bad luck to walk under the center arch
of one of the Memorial Gates at the foot of “the Hill.” One
does so only at risk of flunking his next quiz. Somewhere in
the now dim origin of this tradition it must have some connec-
tion with the fact that one of the gates looks so close to falling
over that it could be bad luck to walk under it at any point.
The brickwork is cracked and uneven. The columns lean and
cant in varying directions. Unfortunately, the memorial arches
are the first thing seen by many, perhaps most, visitors to the
campus. Because of their position on the highway and at the
Lee Chapel parking lot, they annually record a first impression
of Washington and Lee for thousands of people.

The gates were erected in 1920 to the memory of Washing-
ton and Lee men who died in the First World War. According
to Mr. D. E. Brady, Supervisor of Buildings and Grounds, the
arches have leaned since they were built. Apparently they set-
tled in their foundations at almost as much of an angle as they
now have. However, for some decades ivy was allowed to cover
everything, and it was forgotten. Finally the ivy was stripped
away about 1950 to reveal the deplorable reality. Later a pic-
ture of the arches appeared in the Ring-tum Phi under which it
was stated that “Wire and a little luck are all that holds them
up.” Mr. Brady denies that the situation is so desperate; but the
fact remains that it does look exactly that bad.

Of course there is a certain romance surrounding the Lean-
ing Tower of Pisa. But then there is London Bridge, too. The

university ought to repair the gateway—now.

Oh horrors of horrors! What the
unfortunate W&L student has rec-
ently endured! He has been forced
to live with a group of long-haired
rowdys wearing blue-jeans, tennis
shoes, dark shirts and ski jackets.

And think of poor Stevie Stud
who had always been taught that all
college men wore Brooks Brothers
garters to hold up their button-down
socks, but has now found out that
some students don’t want to look
exactly like every other student and
have gone to Roger’s Peate for
their garters.

Imagine the shock too when he
discovered that the Gestapo Commit-
tee, organized by Brooks Brothers to
prevent such action as described
above, has been lax in its job and
has not executed these rebellious
misfits. The sad truth has really
hurt Steve, who, until the present
had always been sheltered from so-
ciety’s evils, but now not only does
he see these awful people, but he is
forced to say “hi” to them or be
subject himself to the penalties of the
committee.

There is only one solution to
Steve’s problem—transfer to VMI.

DICK HERMAN
Bs * a
Sir:

In reply to Dick Herman's letter
published today I have some com-
ments. To me, any student who can-
not find worth in W&L’s traditions
does not belong at this school. The
traditions of this school are so in-
tegral a part of the name and char-
acter of W&L that you cannot sep-
arate them. A student who does not
feel that he can respect and continue
the traditions of Washington and Lee
would do himself a great favor by
leaving. In so doing, he would spare
those who cherish W&L’s traditions
his intentional flouting of those same
traditions.

There is a feeling among some stu-
dents that one should laugh off the
fact that some of W&L’s longest-
standing traditions are going by the
boards. This is displayed very well
in Mr. Herman’s letter. I do not
think this a laughing matter. Gne
does not have to come from any par-
ticular part of the country to see
the value inherent in our traditions
at this school; with any thought at

character of W&L depends on the
preservation of these traditions.

I do not blame anyone if thev
find themselves unable to accept our
tradition-oriented campus, but rather
invite them to admit their mistake
in coming here and go elsewhere. I
do think, however, that those who
like W&L enough to make it their
alma mater should at least endeavor
to support those customs which have
made this school what it is.

ROGER PAINE

Dear Sirs:

tional dress in last Tuesday’s paper
says that the recent leniency of the
Assimilation Committee was due to
the committee’s decision “to see what
would happen if its function was

By BILL LOWRY

Certainly one of the greatest
problems facing us here at Wash-
ington and Lee is what has been
termed “Provincialism.” By this I
mean that there is a tendency to
avoid going beyond the confines of
the campus in further intellectual
pursuit, particularly in our dealings
with students from other univer-
sities. Because of this, our view of
things is all too often very one-
sided, a natural occurrence when
our dialogue with other scho2ls is
so limited.

Assembly in Washington

An example of the possibilities to
which I refer can be seen in the
recent Model General Assembly held
in Washington two weeks ago, und
to which five Washington and Lee
students were sent as delegates. Yet,
despite the fine showing made by
these students, no coverage was
provided in the Washington and Lee
press, and the students had to pay
their own expenses for travel, room
and board (the University paying
only the registration fee for the dele-

 

gation), in addition to being given
no cuts from class attendance at
Washington and Lee. In contrast, one
only has to look at the experience of
the various athletic teams on campus
who have all of their expenses taken
care of, and who are given cuts for
participation as official representa-
tives of Washington and Lee. Cer-
tainly if such can be done for ath-
letic activities, the same could be
provided for the more intellectual
pursuits as well; both types of ac-
tivity have their place in a uni-
versity, and should be encouraged
by the university as much as pos-
sible.

At Macon...But not Here

Futhermore, one finds this week
two outstanding programs at the
neighboring schools of Sweet Briar
and Randolph-Macon; last weekend
saw the literary festival at Holiins.
Is there no room on our own ear us
for similar programs, dealing either
with the arts, or with the more mun-
dane realm of politics? If we are
proud of our own campus, as we
should have every reason to be,

 

A Slam At Slater

 

By DON CASTO

This afternoon as a freshman I
once again took my life in my hands
and ate “lunch” in the University
Commons.

I walked through the line, received
my ration of salad (appetizingly
speckled with hair), colored water,
and some kind of goo jokingly refer-
red to as a main course. But this
plethora of slime didn’t bother me
much because I encounter it every-
day. I picked at my “food” for sev-
eral minutes and then went to the
Corner Store for my daily bicarbon-
ate of soda.

A Profit Organization

The Commons is run by a catering
service that is a profit organization.
This fact is evident in the quantity
and quality of food served, and
there is no doubt in my mind that
this catering service manages to clear
a fair profit.

If the food is so unbearable, who

 

Student Blasts Commons

then eats in the Commons? The
answer is simple—only people who
are forced or bribed to. Freshmen
are required by the University to
eat there and domitory counsellors
and waiters eat there because the
food is free.

Very few people eat in the Com-
mons by choice, and this in itself
is a good indication that the Com-
mons is not serving the purpose for
which it was originally intended. Os-
tensibly this purpose was to provide
a place for students to obtain quality
meals cheaply.

One Accomplishment, Anyway

While failing in this, the Commons
did manage to accomplish one thing.
It helped to strangle fraternities.

Before the advent of the Com-
mons, freshmen ate at fraternity
houses and enjoyed high quality food
at the same price they pay now at
the Commons. They also had a great-

(Continued on page 4)

By ED NORTON

Ten years ago this week, Joseph
Stalin died, thus bringing to an end
one of the most brutal reigns of
tyranny in human history. By what-
ever standards one chooses to judge
him, to Stalin must fall the dubious
honor of being the arch-criminal of
all time. For thirty years he ruled
a great and gifted nation, inflicting
terrible atrocities on her people and
demanding a senseless sacrifice until
that nation had modernized her in-
dustry, exploded a nucleur bomb,
and sent satellites into orbit around
the earth.

Currents of Change

The Western observer cannot
help but be struck by the currents
of change that have swept through
Russia in the decade since Stalin’s
death. Seven years ago Khrushchev
launched a de-Stalinization cam-
paign in an attempt to discredit his
predecessor. While this attack was
largely a device which Khrushchev
used to consolidate his own power.
it nevertheless hinted to the Rus-
sian people that there would be a
thaw in the long winter of repres-
sion.

Other changes have had an !mport-
ant effect on Russian society. The

 

Russian economy has stressed the

EU Y:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The International Scene

 

development of heavy industry and
has never provided consumer goods
for the people on the same scale as
the Western nations. Moreover,
Khrushchev has still not found a so-
lution to the agriculture problem
and Russia can barely provide
enough food to feed her own people.
But the standard of living in the
Soviet Union is rising. Prosperity
and affluence, at least by Russian
standards, are coming slowly; the
Russians like this, and are beginning
to demand it.
New Intellectual Forees

New intellectual forees are also
altering the face of Russia. Although
still subject to strict official censor-
ship, Russian literature and art are
now experiencing freedom never per-
mitted during the Stalin era. In the
last three months, two books, one
about life in a Siberian slave labor
camp and one dealing with the ap-
palling atrocities committed against
the peasants of the Ukraine in the
1930’s, have opened to public seruti-
ny aspects of the Soviet past never
before discussed.

Thus an increased desire for ma-
terial well being and the impact of
new ideas on a literate and intel-

 

 

lectually excited public seem to have
moved the Soviet Union away from

the police state of Stalin and oriented
it more toward some form of liber-
al society. Where once the Russian
people sung the “Internationale” and
shouted “workers of the world
unite,” they now listen to Ameri-
ean jazz and Van Cliburn and their
slogan might soon conceivably be
“two chickens in every pot.”

How Long Will It Last

Yet one cannot help but speculate
on how real and how enduring this
liberal thaw in Russia will prove
to be. The terrible times of Stalin
are over and one cannot live in the
past. But it is necessary to realize
that the past will strongly influence
the present and the future. The en-
tire Russian historical tradition—both
pre-communist and Communist—
has been authoritarian. Periods of so
called “liberalism” in Russian history
have been characterized by a wide
gap between thought and action, be-
tween liberal ideas and the practical
application of these ideas to con-
structive social change. And _ the
liberal thaws of the past have gen-
erally been followed by periods of
cruel repression.

The question remains unanswered
as to whether the Soviet leaders can
escape their own tradition of viol-

 

 

The Washington And Lee Way:
Tradition-Bound Provincialism?

why are there no conventions and
seminars in which other schools are
invited to participate in a more-or-
less official capacity. Washington and
Lee does a great thing every spring
by having the SIPA meet here: why
could not the same thing be done for
University students, as well es for
those from high schools? Some prog-
ress has been made in this era
through the various debating activ.-
ties, but there is much more room
for development here. Why, for ex-
ample, cannot our own _ Interna-
tional Relations Week be mace into
a seminar with official participation
and representation from other
schools, perhaps in the capacity of
discussion leaders, and moderators
of student panels and forums? A
great university is determined, not
only by what goes on inside the
classroom, but by what goes on out-
side as well, and it is here that our
work is cut out for us.

A Student Responsibility

Move, however, is needed than of-
ficial University sanction and sup-
port of such activities, although such
support would seem to be a prere-
quisite for any further dialogue. The
final responsibility for dealing with
the provincialism that plagues us
lies in the students themselves. We,
as students, must realize our re-
sponsibilities in this direction and
seek out new channels in which to
work and be effective; even more
important, we ourselves must be
willing to work to overcome our
provincialism, recognizing the dan-
gers inherent in refusing to act. Pur-
ing the four years we are studerts
we are freer than at any ‘er
time in our life; yet even this free-
dom must be vigorously exercised,
if we are to keep it.

 

Lemmon Reveals
Alcoholic’s Fate
In Current Film

By TOM PACE

Blake Edwards is a peculiar di-
rector. He has made three films in
a year and a half and each one is
completely different. “Breakfast at
Tiffany’s” was warm, funny, enter-
taining and fairly well handled
“Hollywood” film. “Experiment in
Terror” might have been titled “Ex-
periment in Photography,” since Ed-
wards becomes so concerned wi‘)
how and where to use his camera
that you lose interest in the story

Now, “Days of Wine and Roses” is
here. (Starts at the State on Sun-
day.) He seems to have forgotten
both his previous efforts, for in this
one he throws scenes on the screen
apparently only as vehicles for his
actors.

The plot is fairly simple. Jack
Lemmon meets Lee Remick. Jack
and Lee date, Jack drinks; Jack and
Lee fall in love, Jack drinks; Jack
and Lee marry, and they both drink.
Jack becomes less and less success -
ful as a public relations man until
his clients wonder if Jack is selling
himself or Scotch. He loses his job.
The film then becomes his struggle
against aleohol and his struggle for
it.

(Continued on page 4)

A Liberal Movement In The Soviet Union

ence, whether Khrushchev is still a
prisoner of lessons he learned in
Stalin’s brutal political school. Cer-
tain factors would seem to indicate
that indeed this may be the case.
Certainly the Soviet leaders are
aware of what may happen when
people are allowed to freely examine
their own past, when the potentiali-
ties of the mind are released for
speculation, and when people begin
to work for their own personal well
being. Certainly Khrushchev realizes
that a despotic and militant Red
China is ready to pick up the stand-
ard of an international communist
revolution if the Russians choose to
abandon it.

The Essence of the Problem

The essence of the whole problem
however, is not whether the Khrush-
chev regime is better, or more lib-
eral, or enjoys a higher standard of
living than that of Stalin. Rather
it is that a single group of men con-
tinues to maintain an ideological and
political monoply in the Soviet
Union. As long as the rulers fail
to change, both in theory and prac-
tice, the monolithic structure of
Russian political life, they will not
have emerged from under the shad-
ow of Stalin,

Alumni Fall, 28-0, In Spring Game

 

Barranco, David Pace Varsity Triumph

Generals’
Depth Best

In 3 Years

Washington and Lee’s football Gen-
erals unveiled a new offense—the
strong arm of junior quarterback A.
J. Barranco—Saturday as they swept
to a 28-0 victory over the Alumni.

Barranco, a defensive standout for
two years, moved into control of the
Generals’ offensive machine in the
fourth period and guided the Gen- !
erals to two quick touchdowns.

Molyneaux Scores

Early in the period, Barranco cli-
maxed a 45-yard drive with a two-
yard heave to end John Molyneaux.
Halfback Skip Chase set up the
tally with a 25-yard gallop around
right end.

Barranco finished his offensive
showing after Dan Flournoy put they
varsity into scoring territory by in-
tercepting a Chuck Lane pass at
the Alumni 45.

28-Yard Pass

After several running plays, Bar-
ranco uncorked a 28-yard scoring
aerial to halfback Bill David. Full-
back Syd Butler added the game’s
only conversion on a dive over
tackle.

In addition to his TD tosses, Bar-
ranco connected on four of five
passing attempts.

The varsity wasted little time in
starting on its way to its first win
in the varsity-alumni series. The
record now is 1-0-1 in favor of the
varsity.

Safety

The blue team’s front wall broke
through the alumni in the first per-
iod and tackled a wandering alumni
in the end zone for a safety and a
quick 2-0 lead.

The Generals upped their lead
to 8-0 after a 65-yard march near
the end of the first stanza.

David Tallies

Quarterback John McDaniel got
the drive rolling with a 10-yard pass
to David. Fullback Dan Manson then
raced 20 yards around left end to
give W&L first and goal at the
alumni two.

David then put six points on the
scoreboard, plunging off left tackle.
Sackett
Henry Sackett, junior speedster,
handed the varsity a 14-0 halftime
lead when he scampered 60 yards on

Hollins’ Herd Captures
Another Diary Prize

The Hollins College dairy herd
has again been judged the best in
Roanoke County by the Dairy Herd
Improvement Association, according
to an article by the Roanoke Times.

The Hollins herd was recorded
for the month of January at an aver-
age of 52.7 pounds of fat per cow,
a solid three pounds above the
average of its closest follower in the
fierce competition.

During the month, however, the

Hollins females failed to place in
high cow milk production, which
was led by Catawba Sanatorium.
Figures of Hollins production per
cow are unavailable.
The Hollins group consists of 49
cows. Their average pounds of fat
in January was up about nine
pounds from their preceding aver-
age, a very creditable gain.

Lemmon Reveals
Alcoholic’s Fate

(Continued from page 2)

Lemmon Hilariously Funny

Both Lemmon and Miss Remick
are remarkable. As you might
imagine Lemmon is hilariously fun-
ny much of the time. What you may
not imagine is that Miss Remick has
the funniest moment in the movie.
This is the scene in which Lemmon
comes home from work having be-n
demoted. The two of them begin to
to talk about how unfair the firm is
to Jack, deciding that his demot:on
is due completely to office polities. It
is when Miss Remick repeats,
“Honey, you know it’s just politics,”
that everything hits you. She is silly
drunk, and she pulls it off so well
that she should receive the loudest
laugh for her achievement, having
stolen the scene from the more ac-
complished comedien next to her.

Other Good Sceenes

Several other scenes are very fine:
Lemmon and Remick drunk in a
bedroom at her father’s house; Lem-
mon vehemently smashing the potted
plants in a greenhouse that has hid-
den his last bottle; Miss Remick
drunk and Lemmon sober in a motel
room; and the final scene between
the two when he is well and she is
not, very moving in its inconclusive-
ness. They both evoke pity as well as
laughter. Their range of emotions
seems unlimited.

Unfortunately, a good film must
have more than expert acting, and
this one rarely does. Many lines are
trite and poorly conceived, as weil
as inappropriate. Edwards may have
been drunk when he edited the film,
for the editing is both choppy and
illogical. At last, however, he seems
to have mastered his camera. His
angles and shots are no longer forced
but are natural and interesting. The
four scences mentioned above illus-
trate this more clearly. And he must
be praised for his direction of Lem-
mon and Miss Remick.

er contact with upperclassmen and
their individual fraternities.

This extremely important contact
has been irrevocably lost as long as
the present system remains in effect.
Fraternities, debt-ridden and finan-
cially frustrated before the Com-
mons, now with the loss of a large
freshman revenue, are in may cases
struggling to stay alive.

Whether intentionally or not, the
Commons does detract from the
function of fraternities. Previously
freshman contact with upperclass-
men through fraternities provided a
means of assimilating freshmen into
the life and traditions of the Uni-
versity. Now with the Commons this
function has been nearly destroyed.

This is evident in the fact that
since the opening of the Commons
each new freshman class has been
more difficult to assimilate into the
University and has conflicted more
with University traditions and regu-
lations. The Commons has failed to
replace this vital function formerly
provided by the social fraternity.

What is the Commons doing for
Washington and Lee? Obviously not
very much.

Who has benefited from the Com-
mons? Well, the fraternities haven't,
the students haven't, and the Uni-
versity hasn’t. Who has?

The catering service that runs it.

relaxed.” I will agree with the edi-
torial’s point that in this instance
the conventional dress rule had
often been violated. However, I be-
lieve that any attempt to deduce
from this scarcely surprising finding
the effect of allowing freedom in
dress could only be inconclusive.

The recent permissiveness had
encouraged students to act juvenilely
in trying to see how much they
could get away with, as is always
the case under our present system.
On the other hand, real freedom in
this matter would encourage stu-
dents to act responsibly and mature-
ly.

If the Assimilation Committee and
the Executive Committee were to
permit a true experiment by tem-
porarily abandoning or modifying
the conventional dress rule, it would
have to be for a considerable period
of time. It would take some time
for a more mature attitude to replace
the present one.

I, like everyone else, can only
speculate concerning the attitude
which would then develop. In my
opinion there would always be some
who would not voluntarily wear
conventional dress, even to class.
These men would be able to have a
more positive attitude toward the
school than now when they often
view the rule as a threat to their
personal integrity and even deate
whether they should pay a few cents
or allow themselves to be suspended
from school. Although to most the
rule may seem so minor and so easy
to obey, to others it is the most

constant reminder, even more than
the present cut system, of all the
liimtations on individual responsi-
bility which exist here.

Among the justifications given for
the present rule are two which are
somewhat contradictory. One con-
siders this matter so important that
deviation is a threat to our way
of life and therefore cannot be allow-
ed. The other, sometimes given by
the same persons, maintains that,
after all, this is such a minor rule
that no one should have any trouble
accepting it. It seems to me that
the problem is neither too conse-
quential nor too trivial to involve
the principle of toleration and re-
spect for others.

My general impression is, how-
ever, that the overwhelming ma-
jority would come to abide by at
essential aspects of conventional
dress. After the tradition had be-
come established, I see no reason
why incoming freshmen would not
continue to abide by it as at UVa.
The conventional dress tradition
would be much stronger in its ability
to permit diversity.

MACK BROWNLEE

Charlie Byrd
To Play Here
This Saturday

By STEVE GUILD
Managing Editor

Charlie Byrd, well-known jazz and
classical guitarist, will appear in
concert at Washington and Lee to-
morrow afternoon from three to five
o'clock in Doremus Gymnasium.

The concert, which is sponsored by
both the Concert Guild and_ the
Student War Memorial Scholarship
Fund Committee, is being held to
raise money for the student schol-
arship fund which was established
after the second World War to honor
those Washington and Lee alumni
who gave their lives in the War.

Byrd, who will appear with his ac-
companists, plays regularly at the
Showboat Lounge, where he began
his career, in Washington, D.C. In
addition to his nightly performance
at the Showboat Byrd has recorded
several record albums, most notable
of which are Jazz at Showboat, Byrd
in the Wind,” and Charlie Byrd at
the Village Vanguard.

Byrd’s popularity stems partly from
the fact that he is an artist in two
fields. His classical style is not as
good as Seovia or Montaya, but he
was a one-time student of Segovia
and has been noted as the most per-
fected and versitile guitarist in the
music world tody. Byrd plays both

 

See page 4

 

jazz and classical in the “finger
style,” without the aid of a_ pick,
which enables him to blend the clas-
sical and jazz techniques.

Byrd has been playing at the
Showboat since 1957, and the large
crowds at the Lounge every eve-
ning attest to his great popularity.
This is increased by the vast tech-
nical knowledge which Byrd has of
the guitar and he achieves a greater
variety of music by alternating the
amplified and unamplified guitar.

Accompanying Byrd at the concert
will be his trio consisting of Keter

Betts, bass; Buddy Deppenschnidt,
drum; and Bill Summers at the
piano.

Tickets for the concert are three
dollars a couple and $1.75 for a
single admission. The tickests are
available at the Co-op, from mem-
bers of SWMSFC, or at the door
of Doremus Gym Saturday after-
noon

Members of the W&L Concert
Guild and their dates will be ad-
mitted without charge.

Most Dynamic Group
Since Kingston Trio

By JIM LEDBETTER
News Editor

The Friday night concert of Springs dance set will feature
the vocal and instrumental talents of one of the fastest-rising
folk singing groups on the horizon today: the Journeymen.

_ The concert will take place in Doremus Gymnasium, from
——~—*8-10 p.m. on April 19.

The Journeymen, who have an
exclusive recording contract with
Capitol Records, have released two
albums to date, which have both
been on the best-seller lists. One of
their singles, “Kumbahya,” was on
the top ten for several weeks—a re-
markable achievement in the folk
field.

Interpretation

Aside from their technical virtu-
osity, the appeal of the Journeymen
lies in their ability to interpret a
song for an audience, recreating the
time and place with remarkable
accuracy. With the impact of a tat-
tered photograph, they recall the
images of an age long gone; their
folk singing is almost mystically
redolent of the smoke, sweat and
tears of spent wars and unremem-
bered loves.

Though the Journeymen have
registered sensationally in the folk
field, they’re equally adept at pop
ballads ,blues and modern jazz. They
are in the process now of recording
an album of mood and cocktail mu-
sic, much of which they have writ-
ten themselves. Unlike contempor-
aries who have succeeded on exuber-
ance alone, they possess sound vocal
equipment. Their voices together, or,
more to the point, in solo, are pleas-
ing, melodious, and _ virile.

A Trio

The three—John Phillips, Richard
Weissman and Scott McKenzie—met
at a New York recording session and
soon formed a collaboration based

on their mutual regard for folk
music.

Phillips, acknowledged leader of
the group, had been an all-state

basketball and track star at neigh-
boring University of Virginia and
George Washington U. He received
a Presidential appointment to An-
napolis, but injuries sustained in
an intramural game forced him to
drop out during his second year.
It was then that he gave himself
up wholly to music, and particularly
the native American folk tunes he
learned as a child in Alexandria, Va.
John’s own songs and arrangements
comprise much of the celebrated
material in the  Journeymen’s
repertoire.

Dick Weissman represents the aca-
demic and historical approach to
folk themes. He’s won respect as a
musicologist with his extensive com-
pilations of pre-Civil War tunes. A
native of Philadelphia, he studied
at that city’s Conservatory of Mu-
sic, Vermont’s Goddard College and
Columbia U.

McKenzie

Also an accomplished musician
and like Phillips, a native of Virginia,
is Scott McKenzie. The wanderer and
comic spirit of the group, Scott
once seemed to collect prep schools,

colleges, and universities as other
people collect empty bottles. Pre-
viously, he had sung lead in a big-
name vocal group and toured the

A Vocal Challenge To The IFC:
Is Full Potential Being Used?

That the IFC has escaped

the usual barrage of criticism

this year is perhaps a promising sign. Known in the past as
a rubber stamp for the faculty, the Council is beginning to
get back on the right track and regain some of its lost respect.

Despite this propitious omen, however, there still remains

a great deal of potential which

the IFC is not putting to use.

Some awareness of this unexercised potentiality was brought
out in last week’s faculty-student conference on fraternities.
Discussion centered on the three areas of scholarship, pledging,
and the assimilation of the non-fraternity men into the uni-
versity. What results will come out of this discussion, neverthe-

less, remain to be seen.

IFC President Ross Kyger commented last week that the
conference produced a number of “‘concrete ideas’ on ways
to improve the fraternity system at W&L. These ideas, he ex-
plained, will be compiled and studied by a “special committee”’
of the IFC. We trust that this committee will be an exception

to the many IFC ‘“‘committees’

’ of the past which have been

the stopping point of much constructive action.

A Pat On The Back To Macon

For ‘Image Of America’ Forum

We join the Tuesday Edition in commending the students
of Randolph-Macon Woman’s College for initiating and spon-
soring this weekend’s ‘Image of America” conference. The
slating of top-notch speakers insures that the conference will
be extremely rewarding. We urge that Washington and Lee be
well represented at this occasion.

While Washington and Lee is not geared to the same
scheduling of classes as Randolph-Macon, there are many
possibilities that may be explored for the establishment of a
similar program. The institution of a program such as this

could be both helpful and rewarding.

Language Studies Augmented
By New Laboratories In duPont

The very first foreign language
lesson students receive in Washing-
ington and Lee’s ultra-modern elec-
tronic language laboratory strangely
enough is not on tape.

It’s a “no smoking” warning— ap-
propriately given in the languages
taught through the facilities of the
laboratory. The warning takes the
form of colorful, handlettered signs
in French, German, Italian, Russian

and Spanish, and the signs are post-| >
ed in stragetic places along the walls]

of the laboratory. For the beginning
student who may be unable to trans-
late any of the foreign language
posters—one of the signs is in Eng-
lish.

A Washington and Lee German
instructor, David B. Dickens, lettered

the signs for the laboratory. The no'™

smoking rule is in force for the 42-
booth laboratory to prevent damage
to the sensitive microphones, tape
recorders and other instruments in
student booths, according to Prof.

Stuart Stephenson, assistant profes-| '
sor of German who coordinates the ||

laboratory work.
The laboratory, available for in-

struction in all the foreign languages | |
offered at Washington and Lee, is| |

housed in a large converted clasroom
in the university’s duPont Hall. The
laboratory is open daily and Sunday
nights for class instruction, study
and review.

Half of the laboratory’s booths are
equipped with individual tape re-
corders for students’ use, and each
booth has a microphone and ear-
phones plus accompanying controls.
All the booths may be controlled
from the instructor’s console and it
is possible to teach four classes at
the same time. Normally, not more
than two classes—relatively small
conversation sections—use the labor-
tory simultaneously, Prof. Stephen-
son noted.

The instructor, through switches at
his console, is able to monitor a

 

selected student during a class per-

 

Criticism Of Commons Considered Valid
Only Concerning Food, But Not Function

By GARETH ADEN
Associate Editor

Last Tuesday, I read a column by
a fellow freshman criticizing not
only the food at the Commons, but
the function of the Commons as
well. Now no one in the Freshman
Class more willingly admits to the
poor quality of the Slater food than
I; however, there was much in
this article with which I disagree.

First of all, no one is required
to eat in the Commons as the article
stated. What is required is that every
freshman pay for his meals there.
He can then eat anywhere he
chooses, at the fraternity house or
in town. It is unfortunate, though,
that most students simply do not
have the money to pay for two meals
every time they eat.

Fraternities Not Hurt

Half of the column was spent in
arguing that the Commons had
“strangled” fraternities because
freshmen no longer ate at the house
as they used to. This statement is
not true. I know of no fraternities
that have folded because of this
switch ,nor any even on the brink
of financial disaster for this reason.
The fact is the change was made
smoothly with the fraternities mere-
ly preparing less food than before.

The writer stressed the point that
a vital “contact” between freshmen
and upperclassmen had been lost
since the advent of the Commons. I
feel exactly the opposite is true;
in fact, it seems to me that the
greatest function the Commons serv-

 

es is that of giving the freshmen
a chance to eat together. We have
plenty of time to get to know our
older brothers after meals and on
weekends. Too soon we will all be
drawn into a close-knit fraternity
group. What we need in our fresh-
man year is a chance to get to know
as many people as possible. This
chance is provided for by a Com-
mons system.

Important to NFU

It might be good to point out here
also how much the commons has
helped the non-fraternity man, who
now has a chance to eat with his
fraternity classmates

Convenient Location

Another thing to consider is the
central location of the Commons.
It is not at all hard for a freshman
to walk quickly there to eat, but
what if he had to walk across town
and back every time he wanted a
meal?

Finally the Slater System was at-
tacked because it was a profit-mak-
ing institution. This to me was about
like criticizing the medical profes-
sion because the doctors make mon-
ey. Let’s not forget that the Slater
System hires people whom they must
pay and there must make some
profit. The question really ought to
to be—how much does this profit
making reflect itself in the quality
of the food?

Room For Complaint
Here obviously there is much
room for complaint. In general, the

meals are not good and on occa-
sion are very poor. No one really
enjoys eating a stale rice pudding
with water residue on top, or ba-
nanas topped with mayonaise, pea-
nuts, and a cherry. The freshman
is obviously not getting the quality
food he might expect at a school
of Washington and Lee’s calibre.
What is wrong? My guess is that
it is not the idea or function of
the Commons, but rather the quality
of the food served there. It is time
that either the Slater System or,
if necessary ,the Administration do
something to soothe the writhing

 

stomachs of so many starving fresh-
men. |

Don’t Disparage

It Could Be A Sign Of Genius

By PETE ALFORD
Friday Columnist
It seems to me that an inordinate
amount of time is being spent in
the Ring-tum Phi and around the
campus discussing
the length of stu-
dents’ hair. To me
this seems a very
shallow way to
evaluate a man’s
academic ability or
interest in Wash-
ington and Lee.
True, if unruly
hair and a fuzzy
J or _ uninterested
mind accompany
Abed each other, there
is room for criticism; but some of the
worlds most prominent figures—-
both past and present—have had
long, sometimes messy hair.

On our own we cite the Kennedy
family as a group which looks like
they all lost their barbers. On the
conservative side Everett Dirksen
sports an unmanageable thatch of
white, and he still holds an im-
portant position in the Senate.

Einstein is another prime example
of a great man whose mind seemed
to function properly even though his
hair was all over the area.

Futhermore, if we examine the
highest echelons of European intel-
lectuals and social life we find that

   

 

longer hair is the vogue. Not that,

 

By JOHN KIRKLEY

What would you do if a rhinoceros
suddenly appeared on the Washing-
ton and Lee campus, thundering
along the colonnade one Spring day?

In his play Rhinoceros Eugene
Ionesco dramatizes the changes
which occur in a small town when
such a perissodactyl does in fact ap-
pear. At first there is amazement
and consternation; men reckon what
it did and meant. Some suggested
that the authorities be called in.
Then another appears.

Incident

During an office scene the next
day, there is a discussion of the
Rhino-incident as reported in the
newspapers; one man, Bothrd, re-
fused to believe the printed stories,
even when his fellow-workers, Ber-
enger and Daisy, who were eye
witnesses, swear to the truth of the
story.

Another man, Boeuf, is not at
work that day; his wife bustles into
the office in tears. Shortly thereafter,
Boeuf arrives at the office: he has
become a _ rhinoceros. Eventually
everyone in town and in the sur-
rounding countryside joins the
movement; some are converted for
personal reasons, some for the sake

 

see no harm in it and really want
to be like everyone else anyway.

Freedom

After all, why should not a man
become a rhinoceros, especially if
everyone else is? Are not they, after
all, live creatures like ourselves?
Do not rhinoceroses have feelings
too? Why shouldn’t a man be al-
lowed to become whatever he
wishes—don’t we believe in individ-
ual freedom?

Finally there is only one human
being left—only one of all the men,
women, and children, all the doctors,
shopkeepers small businessmen po-
litical leaders society leaders, teach-
ers. This man, Berenger, refuses to
give up his human identity, refuses
to relinquish his individuality, his
freedom to be different, unusual, odd,
peculiar. At the end he eries, as
the curtain falls, “I’m the last man
left and I’m staying that way until
the end. I’m not capitulating!”

The most obvious point of Rhi-
noceros is our dangerous trend to-
wards conformity; men often seek
escape from freedom by losing
themselves in the masses or in mass
movements, such as communism,
fascism, or perhaps americanism.
“Faddism” is prevalent in America;
perhaps the hula hoop and frisbee

were innocent fads, but we must ask

Long Hair—

we should imitate everything that
is European, but we have always
adopted much from the countries
across the Atlantic, and we venture
to say we will continue to do so.

Condemn not a person solely on
the length of his hair as a tradition
breaker anti-conventionalist. Con-
ventions change and we must be
prepared to change along with them.

‘Rhinoceros’ By Eugene Ionesco
The ‘Dangerous Move Toward Conformity’

ourselves if we do not choose our
political leaders in the same spirit
of shallow, sudden enthusiasm with
which we purchase fad-items.

Freshmen

At Washington and Lee freshmen
often acquire, or develop further,
the pernicious habits of smoking and
excessive drinking, usually under
the pressure of example and under
the mantle of tolerance. The extent
to which pressure towards conform-
ity exists on this campus was in-
dicated by an editorial in the edi-
tion of this paper last Tuesday; stu-
dents were reminded that they were
supposed to wear shirts of a “sub-
dued color.”

First, white is not a color: should
we ban white shirts? Next, who shall
decide on the acceptability of the
popular and_ yellow — strawberry
colored shirts? Perhaps in the future
the Assimilation Committee will
regulate all purchases at the College
Town Shop and Thomas, Ltd. and
require all freshmen to buy their
clothes there. Maybe we could even
develop a school uniform of blaz-
er, blue shirt (button down)—or
perhaps white with a certain width
of blue stripe—Old George tie, dark
slacks, socks, and weejuns.

The brutalization of man, another

 

theme in Ionesco’s play, is evidenced

fessionally-made tapes and records
of those made by instructors. The
teacher’s microphone enables him to
speak to the class to the the indi-
vidual students.

Language laboratories have be-
come a common feature in most col-
leges and many high schools in the
past few years. Washington and Lee’s
installation has grown from a small
console-listening unit given by a
student's father in 1960. The initial
unit still sees service in another room
in duPont Hall.

“A laboratory of this type ean be
a highly efficient teaching method,”
Prof. Stephenson observed. “It cer-
tainly stimulates enthusiasm in the
students.”

Some language students are asked
to purchase their own reels of tape
for study. The student-owned tape

MH) serve as the basis for “comparison
| recording.” For this type of study

exercise the student records trans-
missions from the master console,
plays them back, listens and re-
cords his repetitions. After class, the
student is able to listen to his
repetitions and compare them with
the recording to increase his lan-
guage fluency. The laboratory fur-
nishes other tapes for student use.
Language profesors at Washing-
ton and Lee are especially enthus-
iastic about using the laboratory’s
facilities for introducing students to
plays, operas, novels and poetry of
other languages and cultures.

Letters
To The
Editor...

 

 

 

 

Gentlemen:

Roger Payne's recent letter con-
cerning conventional dress has
brought several thoughts on the
subject to my mind.

First, is conventional dress really
a tradition? Traditions, by their very
nature, do not need to be defined
in systematized codes or be enforced
by various coercive means. Our con-
ventional dress “tradition” seems,
therefore, to be but a regulation.

Second ,is all change to be forbid-
den on this campus? Are not all
regulations at W&L subject to
change as both the student body and
society in general change? To be
effective to be respected, regulations
must be adapted to meet the needs
of the social unit which they attmpt
to regulate. I suggest that the stu-
dent body at W&L is changing, and
that the regulations should reflect
this.

Roger Payne feels that we should
support “those customs which have
made this school what it is.” Cer-
tainly W&L’s standing as a univer-
sity should not be based solely on
customs. If it is thus based, I feel
that change is definitely necessary to
to base our standing on values more
educationally significant.

Ionesco’s rhinoceroses could only
communicate with one cnother by
gutteral bellows and trumpetings of
a vaguely emotional content. This is
probably his single most damning
indictment against modern mass so-
ciety, and it certainly applies to a
large portion of our student body.

I have consistently attempted to
stimulate conversation on topics of
more-than-passing interest during
lunch hour in the Commons; most
freshmen are amazed by the ques-
tions, think I must be joking; and
then when they do realize I am
serious, they quickly run short of
pertinent remarks. Nor are the
freshmen the only inarticulate seg-
ment of our college generation.

Conformity, mindlessness, insensi-
tivity, and a breaking down of com-
munication between individuals are
the modern trends attacked in
Ionesco’s Rhinoceros, Man is, in
short, becoming encrusted.

Taking its place with the other
spring sports, baseball has begun
at W&L. The team has been prac-
ticing since Feb. 25 both indoors
and out.

As for material, the team is hurt-
ing from lack of experience. Al-
though strong at third base and
pitcher, the team has yet to fill out
its other positions. Returning from
last year is the captain, Chuck
Lane, who has lettered for three
years. The pitching position is dom-
inated by three southpaws and two
right handers. Sophomores Mason
McGown, Chris Wigert, and Lou
Paterno will help mound strength a
lot.

The big question this year is the
catching spot. Returning to this
position is George Allen. Freshman
Pete Hendricks is a promising
candidate for the receiving end of
the battery. Other promising fresh-
men are Eric Sisler, Danny Nied-
ringhaus, and John Crothers.

“Your Campus Neighbors”

By TOM DAY

With the hopeful early arrival of
warm weather and the thawing of
winter snows, spring sports make
their annual debut at W&L. Possibly
the man looking forward to spring
with the most anticipation, in addi-
tion to the captain of the G.B.D.T.,
is varsity lacrosse coach Bob
McHenry. Coach McHenry looks
forward to a much improved season
and an equally improved team. “With
a few breaks and some good games
we could finish with an even .500
record,” says the coach. He also
added that with the material he has
to work with the team ought to be
able to better last years 1-11 record.

There are 38 out for practice,
a lot more than many previous
seasons. Among these are 12 re-
turning lettermen. The return of
Johnny McDaniel makes the
midfield look exceptionally strong
Among the freshmen out for the
team Jay Bowersox, Doug Mor-
rison, and Tersh Baker seem to be
the most promising. Bowersox and
Morrison play midfield and Baker
concentrates on defense. The fact
that many of the players have
never picked up a lacrosse stick
before and are now playing reg-
uarly is indicative of the good

Dr. Fishwick
Takes Post
With Wemyss

The resignation of Dr. Marshall
W. Fishwick as professor of Ameri-
can studies at Washington and Lee
University was announced today by
Dr. William W. Pusey, III, Dean of
the College.

Dr. Fishwick has been on leave
of absence from Washington and Lee
during the current school year, serv-
ing as director of the Wemyss Foun-
dation of Wilmington, Del. Dr. Fish-
wick will continue to direct the ac-
tivities of the foundation, which
conducts research and study projects
in the fields of American history
and other American studies.

An energetic scholar, and au-
thor, Dr. Fishwick joined the
Washington and Lee faculty in
1949 as an assistant professor. He
is the author of numerous articles
and books, the latest a volume
dealing with Lee After the War,
an account of Robert E. Lee’s
presidency of Washington college.
Dr. Fishwick was on leave from
Washington and Lee during the
1958-59 session as a lecturer in Den-
mark under the State Department’s
Fulbright program, and again dur-
ing the 1961-62 term when he lec-

tured in Germany under similar
auspices.
Having attended the University

of Virginia and received his doc-
torate from Yale University, Dr.
Fishwick is the author of eleven
books, many of these having to do
with General Lee, and _ historical
Virginia.

(Continued on page 4)

 

The new plan will allow an
entering student, if he wishes, to
defer one of the subjects now
taken in the freshman year (Eng-
lish, history, foreign language,
natural science, mathematics or an
ancient language) to his sophomore
year.

In it place he may substitute work
in courses numbered below 150 or
(for which he has the prerequisites)
from the distribution requirements
for his degree.

Thus certain “sophomore” courses
in economics, fine arts, history, phil-
osophy, political science, psychology,
religion and sociology will be avail-
able for freshmen.

As before he must take Physical
Education 1-2 and may elect Military
Training 1-2.

Dean Pusey stated that the Uni-
versity believes that basic knowledge
in the present required categories
is essential to the early academic
preparation of a student, and thus
if a freshman does not choose work
from one of the present require-
ments in favor of selecting an

Compile

4-2 Record In Tourney

Washington and Lee debaters won four and lost two rounds
in the National Invitational Cherry Blossom Tournament at
Georgetown University this weekend.

Bill Noell and Al Eckes, the top*--—-———

W&L duo, debated the affirmative
and negative sides alternately in
compiling the record.

The Georgetown Tournament,
for fifteen years one of the biggest
debating events in the East, at-
tracted eighty-two teams this year,
including many of the nation’s
best.

Noell and Eckes went to the wire
before losing their last round in
the meet, barely missing a spot in
the final competition among the 16
teams who had lost not more than
one round.

Winners in the big tournament
were: the two Harvard teams, Wis-
consin State, St. Peter’s, Navy
Wichita, the two Brandeis teams,
St. Joseph, Holy Cross, Dartmouth,
T.C.U., Penn State, St. John’s, M.LT.,
and Wayne State. The only teams
to beat Washington and Lee were
Brandeis, of Boston, and Texas
Christian. Brandeis won the meet.

Each team entered debated six
other teams assigned beforehand ac-
cording to geographical distribution.
The listings were arranged so that
schools met opponents from varying
sections of the country.

The W&L team defeated Cen-
tral State of Wisconsin, St. Joseph
of Philadelphia, Vermont Univer-
sity, and Georgetown University.
The two losses came in the third
and last rounds; one was taken
while W&L debated the affirma-
tive, and one on the negative.

The debate proposition for the
tournament was the national topic:
“Resolved, that the non-communist
nations of the world should estab-
lish an economic community.”

Mr. William Chaffin, W&L direc-
tor of forensics, commented that he
was quite pleased by the team’s
showing in the tournament. He
pointed out that Brandeis had won
the meet, and that W&L’s only losses
were at the hands of teams who
went to the final round. W&L again

*

Pre-Med Major
Has 2.96 Ratio,
Only Two B’s

A college career which has
to its credit membership in Phi
Beta Kappa and Omicron Del-
ta Kappa was climaxed Mon-
day afternoon when R. Meade
Christian, Jr., was selected by
the faculty as the valedictorian
of the 1963 graduating class.

Only two B’s in courses totaling
four hours of work stand between
the Richmond native and a perfect
3.0 or all A average. Christian
amassed a total of 108 hours of A
work giving him a 2.96 average
through seven semesters of work.

Christian will deliver the vale-
dictory address at the Washington
and Lee commencement exercises

June 7.

In addition to scholastic pursuits,
Christian, a pre-med. major, has
been outstanding in other campus
activities. He was tapped into ODK
leadership fraternity in his junior
year and serves as the current
Washington and Lee chapter presi-
dent. His selection as Phi Beta Kap-
pa also occurred in his junior year.

Both these honors usually come
only in the senior year.

Christian is president of the Phi
Gamma Delta social fraternity and
has served as a member of the
Executive Committee for the past
two years. He is a Robert E. Lee
research scholar, freshman dormi-
tory counselor and an active par-
ticipant in intramural athletics.

Christian plans to attend Medical
School at Western Reserve Uni-
versity in Cleveland, Ohio. As of
the moment he is unsure in what
he will specialize, but pediatrics
is a_ possibility.

The two B's Christian received
were in physical education and a
course on the American Novel. The
B in the latter course came only
last semester.

Of his efforts at Washington and
Lee, Christian stated, “When I first
arrived I ‘ground’ out the grades so
I found it easier to disclipine my-
self.

“There were times when I work-
ed for grades. But in the last two
years, I have concentrated on
learning. I feel I have been for-
tunate in attending a school where
one can be a science major and
yet get a well-rounded education.”

Christian is a graduate of Thomas
Jefferson High School in Richmond.
Last summer he worked in Ghana
with a group sponsored by the
Episcopal church.

Meeting Of Independent

Union Tonight At 6:30

The newly-organized Independent Union will meet tonight to decide
on several matters of administrative importance. The meeting, to which
all nonfraternity members are invited, will be held this evening at 6:30
in Room 27 on the second floor of the Student Union.

Athletics Debate Concluded A Draw

The question “Resolved, that under W&L’'s athletic system coaches
should win,” was argued to an inconclusive finish last night at a meeting
of the Forensic Union. Hugh Trout argued affirmatively for the question,
and John Madison debated the negative side.

Votes were taken before and after the debate, and each time the nega-
tive had an advantage of one vote. There were 20 people present at the

meeting.

The affirmative advanced the idea that in a relatively weak conference
such as the CAC, W&L teams ought to win most of the time. If a coach
has the material but cannot produce wins, then he ought to be fired. The

negative questioned the right of any

person to judge the point at which

a coach ought to be fired, and reminded the audience that most W&L
teams do enjoy winning seasons year after year

EC Rejects IFC Proposal

A proposal that the classes rather than individual fraternities pay for
the Dance Set cocktail parties, sent to the Executive Committee last week
by the IFC, has been turned down. The EC voted in favor of the spirit of
the petition, but did not pass it because it would have placed the proposal
on the spring election ballot. The EC felt that this change should be
effected in some other way than in regular student body elections

Tuesday Edition
Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

“Some will argue that this new plan offers just enough var-
iance in the freshman academic program to make it appear
slightly more tantalizing than the usual staid, predetermined
dose of freshman courses, and that the plan really is not a
change at all, but a delaying tactic.

This is not the case. For one reason alone this program is
worthwhile: it will give the freshman a chance to explore, a
year earlier, a field in which he might major. The plan also
should eliminate the feeling among many freshmen that their
first year courses strap them in like a straight jacket.

We heartily welcome changes such as this one and hope
that the University will take more steps in the future to keep
its academic program abreast of the times.

Students, Faculty Closer?

The IFC-faculty conference held week before last was so
successful that most of the six groups into which those attend-
ing had divided, independently arrived at the conclusion that it
should be made an annual affair. The enthusiasm which this
indicates was not caused by the ideas which were thrown out
in discussion; many of these were the same old tunes which
have been heard for years. Enthusiasm was engendered by
the fact that the faculty and students had been able to com-
municate intimately and sympathetically with each other.

Student representatives involved in the discussions were
surprised in many cases by the degree to which the faculty
members understood and were sympathetic to the student
viewpoint. Concerning the old sore spots such as Rush and the
fraternity effects on academics, or obviously ‘touchy” matters
such as allowing girls above the first floor in the houses, the
faculty was open-minded and interested in practicality only.
This was, although it ought not to have been, a considerable
discovery to some of those present.

One of the end results of the conference, then, should be
the establishments of greater rapport between students and fac-
ulty. Now that the real closeness of the two groups has been
demonstrated, perhaps ‘‘an attitude of student-faculty coopera-
tion,” as one group put it, will be more in evidence.

 

: A Step Forward |

Today’s announcement of the liberalization of the fresh-
man academic program is but another of the strides forward
which have taken place at Washington and Lee during the
past several years. With the increasing emphasis on education,
the incoming freshman needs some lattitude in the choice of
his courses. This new plan, allowing the postponement of a
required freshman course to the sophomore year and the sub-
stitution of an elective in its place in the freshman year, should
be a distinct aid in enabling him to secure a firmer foundation
of basic learning in his first two years at W&L. This liberaliza-
tion is a wise and long needed change.

Frosh Changes Too Late

Dear Sir:

The school’s newly-announced
policy of allowing freshmen to take
one of their required course in the
sophomore year is a commendable
improvement; however, it is too late
and too limited.

The average freshman of today
has received a thorough education
covering a wide range of subjects,
and he should not be burdened with
courses which he has found un-
interesting and useless to him per-
sonally.

Warren Montgomery

Dear Sir:

My limited comprehension fails
me when I try to understand why
the Slater System is allowed to re-
tain a monopoly in feeding the fresh-
men and nonfraternity students at
Washington and Lee University.

The only possible excuse for the
fact that there has been no revolt
against Slater food—as there have
been at other schools—is that the
vast majority of students eating in
the Commons realize they will be
eating real food in fraternity houses
for the following three years. Forti-
fying themselves with the idea that
they’ve already paid for it, and that
it only last a year, the freshmen
endure Slater as they do Hell Week,
compulsory science courses, and
blind dates from Sem.

At Centre College last year sev-
eral petitions were circulated
among the student body concern-
ing the Slater System, and as a
result, there is a new outfit provid-
ing the food at Centre this year.
The new catering service is named
Saga, and serves edible food!

At Hampden-Sydney there have
been riots over the abominable lack
of quality Slater provides. I remain
firm in my belief that Washington
and Lee gentlemen are too well-
behaved to riot, even over Slater.
Perhaps, instead, the Slater people
could be convinced that they are
actually unwanted here, and leave.
Or perhaps they'll starve to death in
the Commons...

Dear Sir:

It is the time of year again when
a student walking in the vicinity of
the freshman dorms must beware of
his step or become the victim of a
well-aimed water bomb. The sun no
sooner comes out than the freshmen
begin chucking plastic bags filled
with water out their casements on-
to the heads of innocents underneath.
Such has been the case every year
since I’ve been here, and such, I
predict (Mark my word!) will be
the case again this year. It can’t
fail.

I do not wish to protest against
the immaturity, the idle adolescence
which this indicates; I merely wish

Pace’s Column

 

By TOM PACE |
I have seen only one Francois
Truffaut film. If I had not, I walk
still recommend that you see both
“Shoot the Piano Player,” and “Jules
and Jim,” for the reason that Truf-
faut is accepted by the critics whom
I read and respect as one of the
finest directors alive.

Whereas his first film, “The Four-
Hundred Blows,” staked his claim
to prominence, the two above have
supposedly secured it. Trauffaut is
a primary figure in modern cinema
and his films are of the highest
value.

“Shoot the Piano Player” is at
the Lyric now and “Jules and Jim”
begins a week from today.

“Days of Wine and Roses,’ now
playing at the State Theater, is a
good film which will be followed
by a better one, “Two for the See-
saw,” scheduled to begin Sunday.

Mitchum plays Jerry Ryan, a
Nebraska lawyer who is in New
York, tired of his wife, tired of
his job, and looking for something
new that all people want.

He finds Shirley MacLaine, who,
as Gittel Moscafi gives one of the
past year’s performances. Gittel is
an off-beat Jewish dancer, a_ soft
touch in more ways than one.

Where Jerry’s trouble had been
being coddled and cuddled, he tries
to solve it by coddling Gittel. He
makes her dependent on him, and
makes her love him for his useful-
ness. Their love and its inevitable
conclusion are the core of the film
story.

Shirley MacLaine is superb.

If one of the film’s major weak-

campus: keep away from the fresh-

She is able to portray emotion
after emotion. She is alive, coy,
moody, lovable, witty, naive, and
surely much more. At least when
she talks, you will enjoy listening.

However, a film, because it is a
film, must be more visual than a
play. There are certain advantages
which the cinema has over the
drama, and it should exploit them
fully. This film rarely does.

Where Miss MacLaine succeeds,
Mitchum must fail. I say “must fail”

BEHIND THE NEWS

 

 

HARVEY WHEELER, co-author of
the best-selling Fail-Safe, is cur-
rently ‘being sued for plagiarism
with his cohort Eugene Burdick.

Wheeler, a former Washington and

any truth to the charges.

The suit was brought against
Wheeler and Burdick by the author
of a book that was copywritten in
1958. The book which its author
says was used as the basis for the
writing of Fail-Safe, was centered
around the same plot type as Fail-

THE INTERNATIONAL SCENE

 

Sukarno’s Indonesia: Will It Ultimately Go Communist?

By ED NORTON

Much attention in academic and
political circles, in Washington and
Moscow is being focused today on
the underdeveloped countries of
Asia or Africa.

It is here that hundreds of mil-
lions of people, just emerging from
colonial rule, are experiencing the
desire for the increased material
well-being and political and social
equality that we in the developed
nations of the West take for granted.
And in a time when total war seems
imponderable, it is in these same
countries that the West and the
Communist bloc are waging what
may well prove to be the crucial bat-
tle.

Indonesia is a typical example,
and a case study of this nation’s
economic and political difficulties
will shed light on the general
problem of the underdeveloped
countries.

Indonesia is comprised of a chain
of islands stretching from the north-
west corner of Australia to the
Malaya peninsula, the total land
area being roughly equal to that of
the United States east of the Missis-
sippi river. The estimated popula-
tion is 100 million, but 65 per cent
of these people are crowded onto
the tiny island of Java where rich
voleanie soil and a constant rain-
fall support one of the most dense
populations in the world. Borneo, the

 

largest island of the group has a
population of only about four mil-
lion.

Throughout the history of trade
between Asia and the West, Indone-
sia has been a source of valuable
raw materials. Pepper, sugar, tea,
coffee, copra, rubber, and tin are
among the valuable exports pro-
ducts, and the virtually untapped
oil reserves are the largest in Asia.
Thus Indonesia has more to work
with in known natural resources
than many underdeveloped coun-
tries, but this rich country is never-
theless in deep economic trouble.

Indonesia is still 80 per cent agri-
cultural and rural in terms of the
value of goods produced, has rela-
tively little industrialization, and the
existing industry is running at only
20 per cent capacity. Per capita in-
come stands at around $100 per
year and is not rising significantly.

With trade, money. income, and
employment heavily dependent on
a narrow range of raw materials,
the Indonesian economy is highly
unstable and subject to wide fluc-
tuation, Rice, the basic food staple
of the population is in short sup-
ply although Indonesia is _ the
fourth largest producer of rice in
the world, it is the number one
importer of rice.

Like most of the underdeveloped
countries, Indonesia’s fundamental
problem is capital accumulation

, which will enable the economy to
| raise total production faster than
the booming population growth. But
the subsistence income of most of
the population stands as an almost
insurmountable barrier to domestic
saving and capital accumulation.

To combat this dilemma, the
United States has poured aid into
Indonesia totalling $665 million since
that country’s independence in 1949.
Aid from free world nations during
the same period has amounted to
$1.5 billion as opposed to more than
$665 million in economic aid from
the Communist bloc countries.

In many instances, however, aid
from the West is highly suspect, and
the legacy of the Dutch, who ex-
ploited the Indies for three hundred
years, still rankles many Indone-
sians.

As the United States Ambassa-
dor Howard J. Jones assessed the
situation, “To the majority of
Indonesians—in fact to most of the
emerging peoples of the African
and Asian worlds—the word cap-
italism brings forth an immediate
and vivid picture of foreign con-
trol of their economy and, not in-
frequently, of foreign expolita-
tion and oppression.”

Such an economic situation is ripe
for Communist infiltration, and
President Sukarno, whom many ob-
servers rate as an economic illiterate,
is faced with political problems as
well,

 

The Indonesian Communist Party
_(P.K.L) and its satellite labor or-
ganizations are tremendously pow-
erful. Numbering roughly 3.5 mil-
lion members, the P.K.I. is believed
to be strong enough to insure its
winning an absolute majority of
elections held any time soon.

For all appearances, Indonesia
has become the Soviet Union’s
most strategic arsenal on all of
Southeast Asia.

Newsweek has compiled the fol-
lowing information: Soviet military
aid totals about one billion dollars;
150 fighters and bombers, at least
twenty of which are MIG-21 super-
sonic fighters, in addition to ground
to air missiles similar to those that
hit an American U-2 reconaissance
plane over Cuba last year are in
the hands of the air force. The navy
has acquired long range submarines,
several torpedo boats, coastal pa-
trol vessels and a 19,000 ton former
Soviet cruiser.

In the face of such aid and the
existence of an agitating and un-
usually well organized internal Com-
munist party, it is not surprising
that Sukarno treds a very fine line.
His policy has been described as
one of “consensus”—somehow man-
aging to secure the agreement of
all rival forces, when a particular
issue has to be met squarely. Thus,
he has maintained real power, but to
do so, he has been forced to do
some clever political juggling.

 

| When he faces direct Communist

pressure, Sukarno appeases them to
a degree; when these anti-West
policies show signs of causing him
difficulty, he ceases that appease-
ment, on a temporary basis.

It seems, however, that for the
first time since 1958, Sukarno’s
precarious balance is in danger of
collapse.

The friendly army has tradition-
ally been his ace-in-the-hole against
internal action by the Communist,
but the army is no longer such a
powerful ally. Communist military
aid has gone not to the army, but
to the navy and the air force. Cur-
rent reports indicate that army fore-
es, still under Sukarno’s thumb, are
conducting campaigns to win them
great public favor. Their aim is to
actively develop Indonesia’s inter-
nal structure.

To date their activities have taken
the form of road building, hospital
development, and factory construc-
tion. If such plans are successful in
winning strong popular support for
the army and its leaders, Sukarno
will again be in a superior bargain-
ing position.

Finally, Sukarno must face what
in his own estimation is a serious
threat to his nationalistic aims. Un-
der United Nations auspices the na-
tion of Malaya, the former British
territories of Sarawak, Brunei, and
North Borneo, and Singapore are to
be combined in August of this year

 

into a new nation called Malaysia.
Surkano’s public claim is that the
formation of Malaysia, which will
berder directly on Indonesia, will
mean his “encirclement by colonialist
imperalists.”

Whether done for purposes of dis-
tracting popular discontent from In-
donesia’s internal economic plight or
as an indication of his desire for
political leadership in this corner of
Asia, Sukarno’s statements are view-
ed with understandable alarm by
Western policy makers.

Since the West is committed to
the formation and the protection of
the new Malaysia state, we could not
allow Sukarno to interfere in the
affairs of the new federation. At the
same time we have no desire to
damage our less than perfect rela-
tions with the Indonesian govern-
ment or to provide Communist prop-
aganda with additional fuel of the
charge of Western imperialism. Su-
karno’s problems regarding Ma-
laysia are quite pale in comparison
to those which he could give the
West.

It is hoped that Sukarno will elect
to put Indonesia’s economic house in
order and to forget any expansion-
ist ambitions he may have. Rich na-
tural resources and a gifted and
large population offer Indonesia the
opportunity to shed her poverty,
achieve an economic breakthrough,
and lead in the development of

_ Rodger Fauber Talks Strategy With Coach McHenry

Six Golfers I

n 70s Make

Season Outlook Bright

With only two returning lettermen
W&L golf coach E. P. Twombly
faces a hard road on the way to an-
other winning season.

His club posted a 5-3 mark last
year and finished second to Virginia
Tech in the Virginia Intercollegate
Tournament.

Track Team
Welcomes 67
To Workouts

The old adage that numbers
breed success is certainly paying off
for the Washington and Lee track
team.

The team which has rolled up a
12-1 dual meet record for the last
two years has a whopping 69 out
for this year’s team.

 

Heading a list of impressive re-
turnees are middle distance star
Skip Essex, shot putter Dave Mon-
roe, javelin thrower Mickey Walk-
er, 2-mile flash Mike Shank, broad
jumpers Robin Kell, Tommy Ed-
wards, and Henry Sackett, and
sprinter Kit Kell.

With this nucleus plus several
promising freshmen and some other
returnees, Coach Norm Lord can ex-
peet another good season.

Biggest obstacle in the squad's
path to its second undefeated sea-
son in three years is the opening
meet with Old Dominion College at
Norfolk, March 29.

The Generals whipped Old Do-
minion, 85-57, last year, but the
Monarchs are much stronger this
year at home.

Several men showed good form as
the Generals whipped Bridgewater,
60-52, two weeks ago in a warm-up
meet. The Generals will meet Mt.
Saint Mary’s College in another
warm-up indoor meet March 20.

Back this season are seniors
Warren Hughes and Bill McWil-
liams. Joining them in the top six
are senior Phil Wyly, sophomores
Jim McBride and Dave Carroll
and freshman Ed Crosland.

“If our sophomores and freshmen
come through we could do all right,”
said coach Twombly.

One factor that might aid the golf-
ers is a more compact schedule. The
yenerals do not start until the sec-
ond week of April and are through
by the second week of May. This

should eliminate the usual bad
weather problems.
Toughest opponents on __ this

year’s card look like Pittsburgh,
Georgetown, and George Wash-
ington. Also on the schedule for
the first time in the College Ath-
letic Conference tournament,
which will be held here May 10-11.

Coach Twombly is optimistic about
his season because all six of his top
golfers shoot in the law to middle
golfers shoot in the low middle

“It's been a long time since I had
six golfers in the 70s,’ Twombly
said. “Nobody is going to burn up
this Lexington course, so we should
be all right. Pll certainly be happy
with six scores in the 70s.”

Football And Dogs
A Winning Duo?

Every year for the past several years the national football
rules committee has gotten together and thought up some bril-
liant new substitution rule for the good old gridiron sport.

First came the wild card. Then the double wild card ap-
peared. Now they’ve returned to the two platoon, or so it ap-
pears at first glance.

Many coaches throughout the nation have cheered or
jerred the new rules, but Washington and Lee’s McLaughlin
is probably the first coach to have actually tested the controver-
sial change.

McLaughlin became well acquainted with the new

rules during the annual Varsity-Alumni game March 2.

Every time he wanted to make a substitution, he couldn’t.
Every time he didn’t want to substitute, he could.

Wise McLaughlin Outsmarts Rules Makers

But wiley Coach Mack isn’t to be outdone by a bunch of
idle rule-makers. The smiling W&L mentor conjured up a way
out.

This way out (more secret than the Atom bomb)
has to do with discretionary time outs, dogs, and striped
shirts,

A little prying, a few questions, and considerable bribery
brought the story into full bloom.

It seems that Coach McLaughlin has suddenly become
very interested in dogs. So interested in fact, that he is starting
his own kennel.

Dogs and football are a strange combination, but
not to Coach Mac. He has a distinct football purpose
for his dogs. And all this mystery of dogs and football
concerns substitutions and rules.

Crazy?

Yes.

According to the new rules, a team can substitute an un-
limited number of men on second and third downs and only
two men on first or fourth downs but all these substitutions
must come during a time out.

The problem that arises is what does the coach do when his
team has used all of its time outs and he wants to substitute?

MARKING ON THE CURVE—AND WHAT
TO DO ABOUT IT

Twonkey Crimseott was a professor. Choate Sigafoos was a
sophomore. Twonkey Crimscott was keen, cold, brilliant.
Choate Sigafoos was loose, vague, adenoidal. Twonkey Crim-
scott believed in diligence, discipline, and marking on the curve.
Choate Sigafoos believed in elves, Julie London, and thirteen
hours of sleep each night.

Yet there came a time when Twonkey Crimscott—mentor,
sage, and savant—was thoroughly outthought, outfoxed, out-
maneuyered, outployed, and outwitted by Choate Sigafoos,
sophomore,

 

It happened one day when Choate was at the library studying
for one of Mr. Crimscott’s exams in sociology. Mr. Crimscott’s
exams were murder—plain, flat murder. They consisted of one
hundred questions, each question having four possible answers
—A, B, C, and D, You had to check the correct answer, but the
trouble was that the four choices were so subtly shaded, so
intricately worded, that students more clever by far than Choate
Sigafoos were often set to gibbering.

so on this day Choate sat in the library poring over his
sociology text, his tiny brow furrowed with concentration, while
all around him sat the other members of the sociology class,
every one studying like crazy, every one seared and pasty.
Choate looked sadly at their stricken faces. “What a waste!”
he thought. “All this youth, this verve, this bounce, chained to
musty books in a musty library! We should be out singing and
dancing and cutting didoes on the greensward! Instead we
are here.”

Then, suddenly, an absolute gasser of an idea hit Choate.
“Listen!”’ he shouted to his classmates. “Tomorrow when we
take the exam, let’s all—every one of us—check Choice ‘A’ on

every question —every one of them.”

“Huh?” said his classmates.

“Oh, I know that Choice ‘A’ can’t be the right answer to
every question,” said Choate. “But what’s the difference? Mr.
Crimscott marks on the curve. If we all check the same an-
swers, then we all get the same score, and everybody in the class
gets a ‘C’.”

“Hmm,” said his classmates.

“So why should we knock ourselves out studying?”
Choate. “Let’s get out of here and have a ball!”

So they all ran out and lit Marlboro Cigarettes and had a
ball, as indeed, you will too when you light a Marlboro, for if
there ever was a cigarette to lift the spirit and gladden the
heart, to dispel the shades of night, to knot up the ravelled
sleeve of care, to put spring in your gait and roses in your
cheeks, it is filtered Marlboros—firm and pure and fragrant and
filled with rich, natural, golden tobacco. And, what’s more, this
darlin’ smoke comes in soft packs that are actually soft and
flip-top boxes that actually flip.

Well sir, the next morning the whole class did what Choate
said, and, sure enough, they all got ‘C’s, and they picked Choate
up and carried him on their shoulders and sang ‘lor He’s a
Jolly Good Fellow” and plied him with sweetmeats and Marl
boros and girls and put on buttons which said “T DOTE ON
CHOATE.”

But they were celebrating too soon. Because the next time
shrewd old Mr. Crimscott gave them a test, he did not give
them one hundred multiple choice questions. He only gave
them one question—to wit: write a 30,000 word essay
“Crime Does Not Pay.”

“You and your ideas,” they said to Choate and tore off hi
epaulets and broke his sword and drummed him out of the
school. Today, a broken man, he earns a living as a camshaft

in Toledo.

ReVue Begins Series Seon

The beginning and the end are
masterful, and the film, as a whole,
is excellent.

Mr. Taylor's ReVue begins series
B in a week from this Friday. The
second series promises to be even
better than the first.

Four of the films were recently
named by Sight and Sound’s Inter-
national Critics’ Poll as among the
fifteen best of all time. The two
which begin the series are two of
the four. They are films by Jean
Vigo—“L’Atalante,” and “Zero d’
Conduite.” That should be an eve-
ning of superb cinematic entertain-
ment.

Mr. Daves, at the State Theater,
has asked me to mention that he
is unable to bring three of the nom-
inees for the Academy Award—
“Lawrence of Arabia,” “The Longest
Day,” and “Mutiny on the Bounty.”

These films are at present only
for 70 millimeter projectors and
the State has only the 35. He will
try to bring them as soon as they
are available in 35.

Of the five, only “Mockingbird”

“The Longest Day” is a big pro-

is time that the notorious Academy

if the Academy is going to nomi-

foreign films are considered for best

It is amazing to me that a movie

Students Attend

Five delegates from W&L attend-
ed the Mid-Atlantic Model General
Assembly held in Washington, D.C.,
February 21-24.

Delegates in attendance were Rod
Crockschutt, Craig Distlehorst, War-
ren Hughes, Francisco Kozhaya, and
Pete Weaver. The W&L delegation
represented Peru, while each mem-
ber participated in one of five com-
mittees concentrating on separate
fields of discussion: disarmament,
finance, special items including the
admission of Red China, decade of
development and colonialism. Reso-
lutions passed by the appropriate
committees were submitted to the
floor of the plenary session for final
debate and for the Assembly’s vote.

Georgetown University, in con-
junction with Howard University,
was host to the Assembly which in-
cluded 110 colleges and _ universi-
ties. Both the delegation and _ its
regional or ideological bloc attend-
ed briefings at its own nation’s em-
bassy and then by speakers from
the State Department and United
Nations.

Frosh Program Changed

“elective” course from the distribu-
tion requirements, he must register
for the deferred work in his soph-
omore year.

Such an arrangement assures
that the student will confront the
essential material during his first
or second year in college, but still
permits the freshman some free-
dom of choice in his first year’s
study program.

Dean Pusey added that it will be
necessary for entering freshmen to
plan their work in advance on the
basis of careful counseling with their
freshmen advisers.

The freshman program is deseribed
in detail in the 1963 Catalogue, which
should be available within the next
few weeks.

Mr. William Wells Chaffin, debate

Commenting on the record so far he
said, “It’s our best in four years,
but the record doesn’t mean much.”
Mr. Chaffin was referring to the fact
that he has used twenty different

Next Week By Various Groups

James Boatwright, Instructor of
English, will present a _ lecture!
next Tuesday night for the Wash- |
ington and Lee Literary Society. |
To be held in the Student Union |
at 7:30 p.m., the talk will be open|
to the public.

The subject of Mr. Boatright’s
lecture will be a critical analysis
of John Updike’s Rabbit, Run,
which was published to unpreci-
dented acclaim by Knopf in 1960.
Updike had been known previous-
ly for his stories in the New
Yorker and he had been praised
for his lyrical style. It was not
until Rabbit, however, that he be-
came well-known. It was his sec-
ond novel; he has followed it with
a third since then, Centaur.

The protagonist of Rabbit, Run is
Rabbit Angstrom, a confused dream-
er who deserts his wife on impulse
and lives with a prostitute. He is
unable to come to a decision about
anything, and at the end of the
book, as at the first, he is still run-
ning. The other characters are pre-
sented with the same home-grown
deterministic outlook. Everything
about the book is startlingly con-
temporary; it is set in a small urban
section of southern Pennsylvania in
the spring of 1959.

The kind of American life that
Rabbit is pictured as running away
from is frightening—vulgar, dead-
ly in its conformity, dull and un-
speakably tasteless. He per-
son caught in the trap of the
American Dream and his lack of

any criterion allows him to es-
cape—but to what? He doesn't
know. His own dreams seem to

be made up of adolescent nostal-
gia for his athletic triumphs and
lust. This is a grotesque allegory
of our ewn lives, with our myth
of happiness and success, our dan-
gerous innocence and _ crippling
antagonism between value and

| ination,”

imminent. Updike treads the line
between bitterness and optimism,
and the result is well worth reading.

The title for Mr. Boatwright’s lec-
ture will be announced next week.

Hailed as one of the truly great
contemporary artists in the folk-
singing and blues field, Odetta has
appeared in all the top night clubs
in America that cater to her par-
ticular idiom. Warmly received all
across the country from the “Hun-
gryi” in San Fransico to the “Blue
Angel” in New York, Odetta’s talent
is no less enthusiastically recognized
in the capitals of Western Europe.

Odetta’s warm vibrant contralto
voice, her intensely individual style,
and her emotionally personal idiom
has made her an increasingly popular
performer. She has recorded albums
for Tradition, Vanguard and River-
side, and is presently appearing un-
der the RCA label. Her numerous
television appearances and annual
college concert tours denote a rapid-
ly expanding professional life.

Born in Birmingham, Odetta mov-
ed te Los Angeles at an early age.
It was during her secondary edu-
cation in the California public
schools that she began taking voice
lessons. Partially assisted by a pa-
tron who recognized Odetta’s natur-
al talent, she worked as a maid for
several years after graduation in
order to help finance her music edu-
cation. It was during this period
that she was first exposed to the
folk music which was later to be-
come her particular idiom. A self-
taught guitarist in these years, she
quickly gained proficiency in that
instrument which allows her to
create “a driving rhythm that car-
ries its own strong emotional thrust.”

To Odetta, the beauty and rich-
nes of folk music brings a sense of
freedom and range of expression
that reveals her as an interpretive
artist of rare gift. Just as significant
to her, perhaps, is the blues field.
Her recent evolution into this mu-
sical idiom promises to prove the
ultimate expression of her artistry—
demanding as it does both freedom
of tempo and emotional pitch.

When asked for comment, Dance
Board President Frank Young noted
his pleasure at the signing of Odet-
ta for the Friday night concert. He
said, “Odetta together with the
Journeymen, who will appear at
the same concert, should provide the
finest folk-music program ever pre-
sented by the Dance Board.”

Odetta will begin her perform-
ance at 8 p.m. and will precede the
Journeymen.,

Brief Bikinis Return To Ancient Glory? |

Cause of long sermons and short jail sentences, the
bathing suit has had as stormy a history as any sea-
borne hurricane.

Think the Bikini is a modern wrinkle? Wall fres-
coes in the ruins of Pompeii show a bathing beauty,
circa 79 A.D., wearing a drastically abbreviated two-
piece swimming costume.

Proper, right-thinking Romans were shocked—and
harked back to the days, as recently as Julius Caesar’s
reign, when swimmers did not sport such immodest
outfits. In fact, they wore no swimsuits at all—men
and women swam in separate areas.

As late as 1800, swimmers were segregated by
sex and faced the waves in their birthday suits.
In those days, ocean swimming was regarded pri-
marily as a health measure, like drinking from
mineral springs.

When people finally recognized the bracing effects
of coed swimming, men challenged the surf in dress-
ing gowns—and ladies in a flannel cloak tied at the
neck.

By 1850, extreme modesty had put a damper on all
this. Men got off relatively lightly, however, in stripped
woolen trousers that reached to mid-calf and high-
necked T-shirts that dropped to the knees.

But the lovelies they ogled were screened
from collarbone to instep by blouse, skirt, panta-
loons and stockings—about 19 yards and 30
wet pounds of modesty.

Probably few ventured into the water at all; here,
undoubtedly, began the tradition of the decorative
bathing beauty who never gets her suit damp. And
just in ease these overdressed damsels were foolhardy
enough to brave the water, their bathing costumes
were equipped with rustproof corsets.

Then came the year of the revolution: 1909. Annette
Kellerman, Australian swimming star, appeared on
the beaches in a figure-fitting jersey suit with sleeves
shortened almost to her shoulders and trousers end-
ing two inches above her knees. “I want to swim,”
she said.

She was arrested in Boston—but she had begun
a fashion trend to swimsuits worthy of the name.

The rule of law was applied—literally. Of-
ficial 1917 beach regulations barred any suit that
exposed a male or female chest “lower than a
line drawn on a level with the ar mpits. ” Bathing
skirts and knickers could not t rise more than

four inches above the knee. In 1920, police pa-
trolled the beaches with yardsticks!

But time and tide were waiting for no man—or
woman, In 1933 the maillot, a one-piece job resembling
a dancer's leotard, arrived from France—and caused
a near-riot when viewed by a gaping crowd in a New
York department store window.

Soon after, the new wave of the future arrived from
the continent. It was the two-piece suit, nothing
more—and often considerably less—than the maillot
chopped in half. Detachable-top suits for men allowed
them to bare their manly chests if they so desired—
and many of them did. Pastors inveighed against the
sinful new fashions. Some of our best-formed citizens
landed in jail.

By 1935, the long arm of the law had stuck its
hand into its pocket in a gesture of surrender. But the
struggle had not yet reached a fitting conclusion.

In an effort to make the swimsuits shape up,
new materials were tried. All-rubber suits were
worn for a time in the ‘30's, but didn’t last long—
they were clammy when wet, and embarrassing-
ly apt to suddenly rip. The elasticized suit was
the tidal wave that hit the beaches in the “40's.

 

In the postwar era, knit suits have had a strong
upsurge of popularity—and for good reason. The old
flattery is still there, raised to a higher power by |
new fibers.

Bathing beaches in these Soaring Sixties are
definitely getting more and more colorful too, with
the flocks of bathing beauties resembling birds of

paradise.

There is also more leeway in today’s suit shape;
the now perennial fitted suit must share honors with
the shift effect and other softly draped shapes that
might have looked kind of baggy before science learned
to spin yarns.

Two-piece styles have gained favor in recent
years after a long period out of the swim, but
the itsy-bitsey-teenie-weenie Bikini — yellow
polka dot or otherwise—flourishes largely (or
is that the wrong word) on foreign shores.

What happens to the bathing suit when it can’t
get smaller—and isn’t likely to become bigger?

It holds fast, in a state of delicious tension, to its
position as one of history’s more delightful strokes of
genius.

 

 

BATHING BEAUTIES display their natural assets in new bathing suits designed to brighten

the coming spring scene.

 

 

“Sees Set Cocktail Pte
An Issue For Spring Elections

A remark in last Tuesday’s Ring-tum Phi has aroused in-
quiries from a number of students. An announcement stated
that the Executive Committee had turned down last week’s
proposal to let the classes rather than the individual fraterni-
ties pay for the Dance Set cocktail parties. It was added that
“the EC felt that this change should be effected in some other

way than in regular student body elections.”

This remark was unfortunately misleading. The reason
that the proposal was turned down, according to Lanny Butler,
secretary of the student body, was that, since the proposal did
not involve a constitutional change, it did not fall under EC
priority. The Committee was in a position only to endorse the
spirit of the proposal and allow the change to come about
through the proper channels. The EC by no means discourages
this issue from being taken up in the coming student body

elections.

That the change should be made is obvious. The present
system of Dance Set cocktail parties is strikingly unfair and
irrational. The expenses of sponsoring an “open house”
for the whole university has become enormous. This has been
particularly true in recent years when the cost of cocktail
parties has skyrocketed completely out of proportion. At pres-
ent, it is sheer absurdity to throw the entire financial burden of

such an extravaganza on a single fraternity.

The feasible way in which the change can be effected is
through the upcoming spring elections. By all means, this
issue should become a major platform plank for the candidates
of both parties. Above all, the change must be made this
spring;the present system is too obsolete to survive another

year.

By the

HON. SAMUEL P. PEGGENGILL
Former Congressman from Indiana

The general acceptance of today’s
slogan that nine or even five men,
neither elected nor removable by
the people, can rewrite the Constitu-
tion as they see fit, and that it then
becomes everyone’s duty to accept
their views as “law,” is a long stride
toward Bonapartism in this coun-
try.

The saying that “The Constitution
is what the Supreme Court says it
is,’ is attributed to Charles Evans
Hughes. But I have a letter from a
former justice of the Supreme Court
who says that Hughes told him that
he was speaking in a jocular mood,
and had always regretted his remark.

A decision by the United States
Supreme Court on a Constitution-
al question, is not only not the
“supreme law of the land”; it is
not any kind of law!

This is because a court has no
authority to make law, or amend the
Constitution. Its judgment, whether
right or wrong, is, of course, bind-
ing on the litigants in the case, un-
less reversed on appeal.

party

But it is not binding on other
persons. As Chief Justice Harlan
F. Stone said in 1942, a court’s
judgment “is binding only on the
parties to the particular proceed-
ings.’ (Columbia Broadcasting
Company vs. United States, 316
U.S. 407). This statement by the
Chief Justice should dispose the
question, especially as there was
no dissent to it.

 

It is true, of course, that other
persons—judges, public officials or

private individuals—may agree that
the reasons given by a court for its
decision are sound and right and

decide to follow them in_ similar
situations.
But they may not agree, and

that is their right. Why? Because a
court of judgment is not law. No
court has the authority to make
law.

This point is much more import-

ant than the Brown case itself, re-
speeting negro children in our
schools no matter which way that
ease could have been decided.

Law can be laid down only by
those who have the authority to
make law. In our country, that
authority is given only to legisla-
tors, elected by the people, and re-
movable by the people. Or it is
in the People themselves in adopt-
ing, or amending their Constitu-
tion, federal or state. There let
it remain!

 

|
|

 

The Constitution says how it can
be amended—only by the People,
in the manner prescribed. No court
is mentioned.

Second, the Constitution says that
all legislative or lawmaking powers
of the Federal government are vested
in Congress. It does not make the
Supreme Court a constitutional con-
vention. As all federal legislative
power is vested in Congress, none
is vested in the Supreme Court!

Third, the Constitution says that
“this Constitution and the laws of
the United States which shall be
made (by Congress) in pursuance
thereof (plus treaties) shall be the
supreme law of the land” and all
“judicial officers, both of the United
States and of the several States,
shall be bound by oath or affirma-
tion to support this Constitution.”

All judges take this oath. It is

a contradiction in terms to argue

that a judge can lawfully change

what he has taken an oath to
support,

This was universally accepted for
a century and a half until recently.
Chief Justice Marshall said in 1824,
“Judicial power, as contradistin-
guished from the power of law, has
NO EXISTENCE. Courts are the
mere instruments of the law and can
WILL nothing.” They can decide
cases, rightly or wrongly, and the}
parties to the case are bound by
their judgments. But no one else!
If their decisions were to bind other
persons, then such persons would be
ruled against without being heard,
without “their day in court.” This
would violate all concepts of justice
and law.

Judges can say what they think
is the law, or what they think the
constitution means, and apply that
to the decision of the case before
them. They can overrule, or re-
fuse to follow what they or other
judges have previously thought
was the law. But they cannot make
laws, or rewrite the Constitution.
A court decision is an opinion!

On the other hand, Congress, in
whom is vested all legislative powers
of the Federal government, can de-
cide what they think should be the
law, and by a majority vote, what
they think becomes law, assuming
that it is constitutional.

~ what a court thinks should be
the law, does not become law be-
cause they think it should.

If that were not true, the Su-
preme Court could not overrule its
own previous interpretation of the
Constitution as it has done time
and time again. In deciding the

did in fact overrule its own pre-
vious decisions, and the settled law
of the nation for ninety years.

But if these PREVIOUS deci-
sions were “the supreme law of
the land” which the judges had
sworn to uphold, how could they
reverse such decisions without
violating their oath?

That the Supreme Court has at
times asted as a super-legislature has
been many times stated by Supreme
Court judges themselves in dissent-
ing opinions. Conferences of the
Chief Justices and Attorneys- Gen-
eral of the States have also charged
the Supreme Court with violating
the Constitution.

Those who are making a fetish

The same thing can be said of the
Dread Scott decision in 1857. Did the
people of the North bow down to
this decision as the supreme law of

not. In fact, the man who did more

Abraham Lincoln, said that if he

Seandal

None of us can remember the
honor system scandal which caused
a substantial number of football
players to leave school in 1952. The
suspension of the students forced
the administration to no _ longer
grant athletic scholarships. The re-
mainder of the athletes on scholar-
ships were permitted to finish their
stay at W&L without the loss of
their professional standing.

The 1950 football season dawned
as the most promising of any year
experienced by the Generals. Losing
only to Virginia and the Volunteers
of the University of Tennessee, this
powerhouse squad crushed Furman,
West Virginia, The Citadel, David-
son,, and Virginia Tech, just to
name the most prominent o fthe op-
position that year. With an 8-2 sea-
son record the Generals faced a
strong Wyoming team in the Gator
Bowl! New Year’s day to the thund-
ering roar of more than 30,000 fans.
The loss of Walt Michaels, W&L’s
leading rusher, due to an injury,
didn’t help the Generals’ chances,
but All-State quarterback Gil Bo-
cetti sought to meet Wyoming’s All-
American tailback Eddie Talboom
on equal ground. But there was no
stopping the Wyoming passer and
Bosetti was able to score only once

With the seandal in 1953 the
payed athlete was ushered out
for good and it was up to men

like Boyd Williams and later Lee
McLaughlin to attempt and bring
back at least part of the former
fame received in the 1950 season.
The fall of 1954 marked the be-
ginning of these attempts as the
Generals’ fielded only a Junior
Varsity team playing afar from
satisfactory schedule. The results
were promising, however, as Boyd
Williams coached his team to a
2-1-1 season.

In the next few years the Gen-
erals attempted to remain in the
field against the powers they had
formerly been able to beat resound-
ingly. The result was only discour-
agement and many, many losses. But
in 1959 the story began to change.
Schools on our own level became
more and more prominent on the
W&L schedule and we began win-
ning. Coach Lee McLaughlin’s re-
building program began paying off.
That year Centre College fell in the
opener and Dickinson limped off,
routed by a 42-14 score that had
the sportswriters turning _ their
heads. The year ended with the
Generals still on the wrong end of
the season record, 3-4-1, but with
more hope tha never before for
better things to come.

The 1960 season bore these hopes
out. The Generals ,finished their first

Promising Season
For Tennis Squad

The outlook for this year’s varsity
tennis team is quite promising main-
ly because six of last year’s seven
lettermen are returning.

Bad Weather

Thus far Coach Washburn has
been hindered extensively by the
elements. The squad has been unable
to get to play on courts due to
bad weather and slowness in the
preparation of the courts, but Wash-
burn has been getting the team in
shape with workouts in the gym.

Captain John Baker will lead
the squad again this season to
what should be a highly success-
ful campaign.

The team will rely heavily on the
strong playing of Jim DeYoung
and Randy Jones who held up very
well for the Generals last season.

 

Coach Washburn says that there
are several freshmen who might be
of help to the team, but he is un-
sure since he has not had adequate
chance to watch them in action.

First Match
The team’s first match is against

Colgate on March 26. Colgate,

which has one of the best teams

among northern schools, should
give the Generals a tough open-
ing match.

The team’s schedule also includes
the University of Virginia, a strong
team which the Generals upset last
season, Old Dominion, Hampden-
Sydney, Georgetown, Richmond,
George Washington and Lynchburg.

The season will conclude with the
CAC tournament which will be held
here May 10-11.

that if they do not abide by it, they
will be reversed on appeal.

It is also true that a court may
participate in the lawmaking pro-
cess by giving reasons for its de-
cision which seems so convincing
that they are gradually accepted
BY THE PEOPLE as good law. This
is how the common law of England

developed.
The political shibboleth that
“the Constitution is what the

.

judges say it is,” no matter what,
is so destructive of constitutional
principles, that every patriotic
American should condemn it.

For there is a rapidly growing
concentration of governmental, eco-
nomic and financial power in Wash-
ington, and particularly in the Chief
Executive, who appoints all Federal
judges.

If this trend is not soon reversed,
then the statement by a high official

that “the Constitution was written
for an entirely different period
in our nation’s history” may be-

come the epitaph of American lib-
erty.

Election of the two men_ took
place yesterday afternoon. Both
have worked on the Calyx staff for
three years.

Butler was opposed for the editor-
ship by Bill Bowen, but Turner was
the only candidate for the position

tween Butler and Bowen was made
on the basis of originality and
merit of their plans for the annual
next year, and on ability and ex-

Each of the candidates gave a de-

eleet Butler proposed the tentative
theme of next year’s Calyx being
centered around the liberal arts
education one of the central pur-
poses of which is the development
of gentlemen.

Butler described the theme as
being a literary one dealing with
the development of this liberal arts
education theme.

Included in his plans were reso-
lutions to cut the yearbook’s ex-
penses, the possibility of adding
more color photographs, and the de-
velopment of picture themes with
more originality and color.

Election Close

Paine, speaking for the Publica-
tions Board, sad that “the choice
between Bowen and Butler was
very difficult to make.” Voting for

the editorship was close, he said.

At the Monday afternoon meeting
the Board also heard Tain Tomp-
kins’ presentation for the editor-
ship of the Southern Collegian.
Tompkins submitted his application
early because he will be out of town
at the date when Collegian and

The publications Board will meet
in mid-April to consider applica-
tions for business managers and edi-

to plan the yearbook layout with
Lynchburg publishers the same

In the discussion, Tim

Lecture optic:

‘Rabbit, Run’

James Boatwright, Instructor of
English, will present a lecture on
John Updike’s Rabbit, Run, in the
Student Union building tonight.

The lecture is sponsored by the
Washington Literary Society and is
scheduled to begin at 7:30 p.m. Boat-
wright’s talk will concern ambiguity
in Rabbit, Run, a difficulty many
readers have found in the best-
selling novel.

The basic ambiguity, says Boat-
wright, is that the novel’s protagon-
Rabbit Angstrom, is presented
as a sympathetic character but does
things normally expected of a villain.

Can't Stop Running

Rabbit is a confused dreamer who
deserts and returns to his wife sev-
eral times during the course of the
story. Each time he leaves his wife
he goes to live with a_ prostitute.
In the end Rabbit also runs away
from the prostitute, as unable
finally to cope with life as he was
at the outset.

In his lecture tonight Boatwright
will first talk on the general sub-
ject of ambiguity in fiction, and
then move on to the novel. He hopes,
he says, to clear up some unintended
ambiguities in the story.

Rabbit, Run is Updyke’s second
novel, and has lately been followed
by a third success, Centaur, Up-
dike has also published two books of

 

 

short stories and a book of poems.

tive writing course offered by Washington

*and Lee’s English department, he
will work closely with students in-
terested in writing careers. He also
will give occasional lectures be-
fore students, faculty and the gen-
eral public.

Announcement of Humphrey's ap-
pointment was made by Dr. Arthur
R. Borden, Jr., professor of English
and chairman of the Glasgow En-
dowment Committee which sponsors
the visiting professorship. The Glas-
gow program was initiated under a
bequest from the late Arthur Gra-
ham Glasgow, whose will specified
that income from his gift was to
be used “to promote the art of ex-
pression by pen and tongue, includ-
ing voice production and delivery.”
The gift is known as the “Arthur
and Margaret Glasgow Endowment.”

The endowment’s donor was a
brother of Ellen Glasgow, Virginia
novelist. His father, Francis T.
Glasgow, was a graduate of Wash-
ington College, as Washington and
Lee was known in 1849.

Humphrey, a native of Texas, was
born in 1924. He taught at Bard Col-
lege for eight years. His first book,
a collection of short stories, was en-
titled The Last Husband and Other
Stories and appeared in 1953. His
first novel, Home from the Hill,
was published in 1958 by Knopf.
Subsequently, the novel was made
into a successful movie.

Since early 1961, Humphrey and
his wife, who make their permanent
home in Massachusetts, have been
living in Europe. He has been work-
ing on a new novel.

‘Too Much Emphasis’

° e e ° — :
Assimilation Committee 2st ka

There can be little doubt that the Executive Committee’s
afirmation of support for the Assimilation Committee last
night does express the convictions of the vast majority of
Washington and Lee students. In spite of a recognizable
trend toward the casual (and the sloppy) all over the United
States, the tradition of conventional dress is too valuable to
WL to be abandoned or even weakened. And the Assimila-
tion Committee is doing its job too well to be swept aside at the
behest of young philosophers and outraged individualists,

whose philosophy consists of

individuality consists of not wearing socks, and who are far
less valuable to Washington and Lee than the tradition they

flout.

These few have asked for abolition of the Assimilation
that it is an infringement on
their freedom; but they have missed the issue. The issue is not
freedom vs. forced conformity—to argue this is to quibble

Committee because they feel

over terms. The issue is the

dress. If conventional dress is a tradition worth keeping, and
the majority of students believe it is, then there ought to
be no serious objections to the existence of a small group with
which can be entrusted the continuation of the tradition. This,
the continuation of the tradition, is the only purpose of the
Assimilation Committee; it in no way, in its duty, member-
bership, or performance, resembles a Gestapo organization,
as has been intimated by a fringe of students. The Assimilation
Committee intends no violence to individuals’ freedom; it
works with an idea to create an atmosphere that should be
indicative of the students’ well-placed pride in the university.

tions’ in general, with both sides.
making what appears to be the same
mistake—that of magnifying the im-
portance of such things far out of
proportion, thus giving the casual
observer a distorted view of the
role they play in Washington and
Lee life in general.

My own views on the particular
controversy under discussion—that
of conventional dress and the As-
similation Committee—is of course,
with those who oppose the arbitrary
enforcement of the conventional
dress requirement. As far as Tam
concerned, it makes absolutely no
difference what students wear,
either to class or in the town itself,
and I would be in complete sympa-_
thy with a movement to abolish both >
the Assimilation Committee and)
conventional dress itself, simply be-
cause of the false emphasis such a
rule places on appearance and super- |
ficiality.

‘Emphasis on Superficiality’

At the same time, however, those |
who take this position seem to be
undermining the very thing they're,
trying to destroy by placing empha-_
sis where they do; such violent op-
position has been encountered in)
many quarters does nothing but re-
inforce the opinions of those who
favor the present arrangement, and
the whole tenor of the controversy
thus created places an unnecessary
emphasis on the very superficiality
it seeks to oppose. Furthermore,
with all the problems which face

not cutting their hair, whose

New Trend in Films Noted

By TOM PACE

In the past week I have seen five
films—“Days of Wine and Roses,’
“Splendor in the Grass,” “Shoot the
Piano Player,” “Roman Holiday,”
and “The Hook”—all of which, in
some manner or other, were worth-
while.

However, one of these, “Shoot the
Piano Player,” was considerably
superior to the others. There are
good reasons for its superiority;
these reasons should help point out
not only significant integrants in a
quality film, but also a significant
trend in the current cinema.

Franeois Truffaut, the director,
wrote the screenplay himself. He
was admitted, therefore, to an inti-
mate knowledge of the plot and its
characters. By his writing the
screenplay, the film became more
closely, solely his work; thereby
reinforcing his ego and evidently,
his efforts.

Ordinary Story, Unusual Film

It is a simple story with common
elements. Yet where the story is
ordinary, the film is not. Truffaut's
treatment lifts it up for praise.

For example, you have his charac-
ters. His hero is a saloon piano
player. He is a weak and timid man.
Yet he is an attractive character. He
has good humor, with an odd but
effective mixture of the comic and
the sad.

You can laugh with and at him.
You can fall for and with him.

The gangsters seem completely
unlike gansters. They are funny and
human and always enjoyable.

Truffaut’s female characters—save
the young prostitute—although they
are often lovable, nonetheless usually
possess enough bitchiness to keep
the males in a more favorable light.

Characters ‘Always Plus’

My reaction to his characters was
always plus. I enjoyed seeing gangs-
ters being good fellows. I thought
it was time that some man showed
that all women have a little bitch
in them. And I liked having a hero
who was sympathetic for all the
wrong reasons.

The most remarkable part of the
film was Trauffaut’s technique. He
possesses a style. Many parts make
up the whole of his style.

There is the amazing pace of the

seem to be many things which have
a much more immediate importance
than whether or not to wear a coat
or tie.

A far greater danger appears to
be present, however, in the writings
of those who resist any constructive
evaluation of the role of the so-
ealled “traditions” at Washington
and Lee; this consists of linking
Washington and Lee with its “tradi-|
tions” to such an extent that one
sees no value in Washington and Lee
apart from things like conventional
dress.

In Spite of ‘Traditions’

This danger is most evident in
those statements which attempt to
show that, without, for example,
conventional dress, Washington and
Lee would be “just like any other
school,” thus implying that the only
thing which makes W&L a distinc-
tive institution of higher learning is
the presence of the so-called “tra-
ditions,” of which conventional dress
is the most notorious example,
Speeking for myself, I must admit
that I have remained at Washington
and Lee in spite of such traditions,
rather than because of them, and
certainly do not consider them to be
an integral part of anything which

action—so rapid that I find it un-
paralleled in recent viewing; there
is the always moving camera, rarely
remaining in one position for more
than five or six minutes; there is the
constant use of the close-up that
somehow is never jarring and there
is neo-realism, his use of shock.

There preceding paragraphs lead
to a generalization about this “new
trend” in films.

A Return to the Visual

Films are becoming more visual.
Emotion, impact, interest, inudument
all have become more dependent on
what is seen, how the camera is:
used.

The cinema is becoming cinema.
again. when dialogue becomes only
an ordinary part of a film, when it
no longer must carry the movie, then
the cinema is approaching its natur-
al state. Characters are more ef-
fective now; not the stock gangster,
cowboy, or lover .

They are original and different,
and they are more real. In addi-
tion, the film has become the di-

 

 

‘Traditions —

| without pointing up the more un-

 

rector’s work of art. He is solely re-

kes Washingt Lee “ —
sponsible. I only hope that our coun- nn Teen oe See oe

Or Rules?

Fuliermore, it should be pointed
owt thet much of the confusion
peers to be caused by a misunder-
standing of the nature of tradition
itself. Judging from my own obser-
vations of the past four years, it
would appear that such things as
excessive drunkenness and “dump-
ing on your date” are traditions with
just as much, if not more importance
as the Honor System and the “speak-
ing tradition”; the more or less sys-
tematic opposition to conventional
dress which arises each year Is just
as much a tradition as is conven-
tional dress itself. It appears, there-
fore, somewhat dishonest to pick out
those “traditions” which look good
and place them before the public as
the image of Washington and Lee,

ap-

savory aspects which can also be
called “traditional” in every sense
of the word.
Tradition Must Be ‘Spontaneous’
A so-called “tradition,’ in order
to be a tradition, must arise spon-
taneously from the feelings of the

| student body as a whole; it cannot
be arbitrarily imposed by fiat. For

this reason, the presence of devia-
tion from an established pattern may
well be a sign that a tradition does
indeed exist, simply because of the
indication that obedience to the so-
ealled “tradition” is voluntary, rather
than enforced.

A respect for the past is both
healthy and necessary ,especially in
today’s radically changing world.
At the same time, however, accept-
ing the past merely because it is
the past is just as bad as advocating
change for the sake of change. Any
tradition which is worthy of the
name cannot help but be enriched

Letters
To The
Editor...

To the Editor:

Sitting in the Commons, I recently
caught myself in a not too uncom-
mon discussion on the University
and its traditions.

The usual banter about striped ties
do not a prison make nor ironed
shirts a cage arose along with what
Falstaff and the E.C. might con-
sider honor.

And yet, to quote from our mime-
ographed alma mater, I suddenly
realized that this was all I had been
doing since the beginning of this,
my freshman year. And to witness
from the articles in the Ring-tum
Phi, my contact with independent
and even some fraternity upperclass-
men, and such publications as “Pro-
test,” this is apparently all a great-
er portion of the student body finds
significant with the University.

English Instructor James Boatwright speaks tonight on
Rabbit, Run to W&L Literary Society (see story page 1).

By WARREN MONTGOMERY

In the past two weeks, this paper
has printed unceasing attacks by
irate students against the Slater
Food Management Service. A furth-
er exposee is rather like kicking the
corpse or waving the bloody shirt
(and most freshmen will swear that
the shrimp creole is bloody shirt
a la king).

But there is yet one unrevealed
atrocity which all last minute break-
fasters are familiar...an atrocity
which surpasses in callousness all
that has been heretofore exposed to
public scrunity. This atrocity is
Slater’s regular custom of running
out of food at the stroke of 8:15, just
when the eat-it-in-five-minutes-or-
be-late-to-class diners dash in. What
transpires at these frequent and
tragic catastrophes usually goes like
this:

Palace of Culinary Delights

8:14—Famished student enters the
Slater Food Palace of Culinary De-
lights, having eleven minutes to
stuff himself and make it to the re-
mote extremities of the campus for
his 8:25 Chemistry class.

8:14.25—Student reaches the line
line and catches his first tantaliz-
ing whiff of prune juice, burnt toast,
and Slater’s unique clotting syrup.

8:14.5—His stomach beginning to
growl, the student grabs a tray and
plunges into the depths of the for-
bidden interior of Slaterdom, the
food line.

Quaint Yellow Lard

8:14,75—Student reaches the height
of anticipation at the prospect of

 

 

 

Chamber Of Horrors:
Commons At 8 A.M.

Slater’s moth-watering waffles, cov-
ered with the quaint yellow lard
that passes for butter and the unique
clotting syrup.

8:15—-The kitchen runs out of the
mouth-watering waffles. Not only
does Slater run out of mouth-water-
ing waffles, they run out of the
waffiles that they serve too.

8:16—Drooling by now, the student
feels the first twinges of resentment
at having been denied a minute of
eating time. The Slater people be-
gin to chat with each other.

Waiting ... Waiting ... Waiting
8:17—His wrath mounting steadily
the student asks, “How much longer
‘til you'll have some more food?”

“Huh? Whazzat?” the nearest den-
izen of the scullery blurts out.

“TI say when will there be some
more waffles?”

“Oh, we're out of waffles! Fancy
that!” And with this revelation, the
white-uniformed server waddles
down to the far reaches of the kitch-
en where the goodies are manufac-
tured. She is seen mumbling some-
thing te the pudgy man in the tall
chef’s hat. (And incidentally, it is
fantastie how much this particular
individual presumes in wearing a
chef’s hat).

Juice and Curdied Milk
8:18—Chef pours batter into wafile
cookers. Student downs glasses of
milk and grapefruit juice simul-
taneously to ally his hunger and is
rewarded by a gurgling feeling in
the pit of his stomach as the milk

THE INTERNATIONAL SCENE

 

Revolution

By ED NORTON
In the always volatile Middle East,
revolution has reached epidemic pro-
portions. Since last September, coups

proclaimed their friendship for the
Egyptian president .Both of the coups
in Iraq and Syria were the work of
the Ba’ath (Arab Awakening)

 

have toppled three regimes and have
virtually reversed the situation in
the Arab world from what it was
six months ago.

From Yemen, the remote primi-
tive country tucked on the south-
west corner of the Arabian penin-
sula, came the word last September
28 that the centuries old dynasty of
the Iman had fallen. Colonel Ab-
dulla Sala, leader of the coup, pro-
claimed a “republic” which ever
sinee has owed its existence to the
presence of Egyptian troops sent by
Gamal Abdel Nasser, President of
the United Arab Republic. On Feb-
ruary 8 Iraqi army officers ended the
four year dictatorship of Abdul
Karim Kassem. And on March 8
a military coup toppled the govern-
ment in Syria.

Cemmon Elements

Each of these revolutions seems to
have a great deal in common. In
each case, the army overthrew
regimes hostile to Nasser and in-

 

stalled governments which quickly

Party—a_ socialist organization de-
voted to the idea of Arab unity. The
basie ideology of the Ba’ath is that
“there are no Arab nations; there is
only one Arab nation.” And_ this
same is warmly supported by Presi-
dent Nasser.

The new governments in Syra,
Iraq, and Yemen share other ideals
which will tend to draw them closer
together and closer to Cairo. They
desire to remain neutral in the con-
flict between East and West and are
hostile to Communist and Western
attempts to exert internal political
influence. Primarily socialist in eco-
nomic policy, these governments are
seeking badly needed modernization
and social reform. And they are de-
voted to the “liberation” of other
Arab nations which they consider to
be backward regimes, barriers to
Arab unity, and tools of foreign in-
terest. The monarchies in Jordan
and Saudi Arabia are the prime ex-
amples of such nations. This Nas-
ser’s dream of Arab unity which was

 

rudely shattered when Syria broke
away from the United Arab Re-
public in 1961 now may have a very
real chance of reaching some frui-
tion.

Barriers to Unity

However, there are still serious
barriers to Arab unity, or at least
Arab unity dominated by Gamal
Abdel Nasser. Almost the entire
Arab world has gained national
sovereignty, and only the fringes of
the Arabian peninsula remain under
direct foreign control. With this in-
dependence, the emphasis of Arab
polities has shifted away from na-
tionalism to problems of internal re-
form. But reform and unity may be
difficult to reconcile, especially in
the light of the differences between
the Arab nations.

Regional Differences

Yemen, for example, is one of the
most backward countries in the
world, and in many respects has
just begun to emerge from centuries
of feudalism. Syria and Iraq, with
educated, politically-active classes
and semi-capitalist economies, have
reached a stage of much higher de-

velopment and their problems will
be different from those of Yemen.
Syria, which depends heavily on
capitalist free enterprise may run
into conflict with primarily socialist
Egypt. Racial and religious differ-
ences, even in a predominately mus-
lim world, hinder any attempts at
close unity within the Arab world.
In Iraq particularly, the Kurdish
community has demanded some form
of autonomous self rule.

Entente, but not Union

It is not likely, moreover, that the
governments of Iraq and Syria will
be eager to place themselves under
the control of Nasser. The Ba’athist
leaders seem to have reshaped their
idea of Arab unity around a loose
federation of Arab states without
any centralized control. Salah Bitar,
Premier of Syria, indicating that
such a poliey would be followed by
his government, has said, “We will
proceed to new entente with
Egypt, but not union.”

a

More Conflict to Come
The revolution in Syria is not like-
ly to be the last that will shake the
Middle East, and in many ways the

 

 

in the East: A Move Toward Arab Unity

situation may be more unstable than
it was six months ago. King Hussein
of Jordan is under increasing pres-
sure and there have been reports
of a Ba’athist, pro-Nasser plot to
depose him. Fearing that Hussein’s
overthrow would bring Egyptian
forees into Jordan, Isreali Prime
minister David Ben Gurion warned,
“If Hussein falls, it will mean war.”
For then Isreal will be surrounded
by Arab states dedicated to its de-
struction. And Nasser’s forces in
Yemen have been charged with at-
tacking Arabian towns just across
the border, creating the danger of
conflict between Egypt and Saudi
Arabia.
The U.S. Policy

The United States has generally
greeted the recent nationalist revo-
lutions hopefully, recognizing that a
united Middle East is the best de-
fense against Communism _infiltra-
tion in this vital area. But we have
also made it plain to Nasser that
this eountry will not telerate any
military adventures into either Jor-
dan or Saudi Arabia. We will sup-
port Arab nationalism, but not at
the risk of war in the Middle East.

This will be a familiar scene Tuesday when W&L opens its lacrosse season.

Searches For Lacrosse Goalie

For the second straight year

Washington and Lee University’s la-|

erosse coach Bobby McHenry
frantically searching for a goalie.

The season’s opener with Swarth-
more College (here March 26) is less
than a week away and the Generals
still do not have a tested hand in
the goal.

McHenry has switched sophomore
Butch West from midfield to goal in
hopes of solving the Generals’ most
pressing problem.

If lightning strikes twice in the
same place, McHenry might come up
with another All-American goalie.
Last year he put attackman Ray
Miller of Baltimore into the goal and

 

Outfield Weak

Good Pitching May Help W&L
Improve Baseball Record

If good pitching breeds success in baseball, then Coach
Joe Lyles’ Washington and Lee club should be well on its

way to an improved season.

The Generals struggled to a poor*

1-11-1 record last year, but were
plagued with pitching troubles all
season.

This year Lyles welcomed six
pitchers, all of whom show promise.
Good Pitching
Heading the staff are returnees
Mason MeGowin, Brice Gamber,
Chris Wigert, and Louie Paterno.
These four plus a pair of freshmen—
Charles Clement and Sam Simpson—
should make quite a formidable

hurling corps.

Outfield is the big problem right
now. The Generals are very inex-
perienced in the garden, having lost
all three of their 1962 starters to
graduation.

Captain Chuck Lane, Buck Rose,

These together with several prom-
ising freshmen are giving the Gen-
erals a slick-looking infield.

Catching seems to be the least
of Lyles’ worries. Experienced mit-
man Ashley Allen is returning and
Lyles can also call on a pair of
promising freshmen prospects in
Pete Hendricks and David Red-

Miller proceded to become a second
team All-American at that position.
West, another Baltimore product,
has looked good so far in kicking out
shots.
Attack Questionable

The Generals’ attack is another
question mark. Experienced soph-
omores Carroll Klingelhofer and Bob
Hankey and midfielder turned at-
tackman Randy Wootton will have
to carry the burden of the W&L of-
fense.

What attack the Generals have is
fair to good, but the trouble is
there’s not enough of it.

Midfield Strong

A strong group of midfielders
should considerably brighten W&L’s
chances of improving last year’s 1-11
record.

John McDaniels, who McHenry
tabs as one of the top lacrosse pros-
pects that W&L has had in many
years, Steve Stull, and Eben War-
ner rate as the top midfielders.

For the first time in four or five
years, the Generals boast numbers
at midfield.

“We have 15 midfielders right
now,” McHenry said. “This should
help us to improve.”

‘Track Team
Faces Mounts

Mount St. Mary’s College, one of
the stronger members of the Mason-
Dixon Conference, will give the
W&L track teem its final warm-up
test Wednesday night at VMI.

"he

Generals, who whipped
Bridzewater College, 60-52, in an-
other warm-up indoor meet two
weeks ago, face Mount St. Mary’s
in their final preparation for the
opening of the spring track season,
Prid y, March 29, against Old Do-
minion College at Norfolk.

Tough Foe
Mt. St. Mary's, which finished

fourth in the Mason-Dixon chum-
pionships last spring behind Ro»-
noke, American University, and
Gallaudet, will offer the Generals a
sincere threat.

Tocir top performances include
9.9 in the 100, 22.6 in the 220, 1:58.7
in the 880, 16.3 in the high hurdles,
25.4 in the low hurdles, and 22-10'2
in the broad jump.

Washington and Le’s track squad,
67 strong, is shooting for its fourth
straight good season. For the last
three years, the Generals have a
20-1 dual meet record. Only Wake
Forest, which topped the Generals,
69-62, last year, has marred a_ per-
fect record.

25 Veterans

Twenty-five veterans and a_ host
of freshmen are combining to form
a team of real promise.

Headed by co-captains Dave Mun-
roe in the shot put and Mickey

boast good depth in every event
but two—the high jump and the
pole vault.

Junior Robin Kell stands alone
as the best in the high jump and
hop-step, and jump. His brother, Kit,
is the Generals’ top dash man, but
he is currently sidelined with a
leg injury.

Freshman Don Casto, Scott Ken-
nedy, and Mark Owen and junior
Henry Sackett should take up the
slack in the sprints.

count for some welcomed depth.

‘Eternal Vengeance’ For Slater

juice.

8:19—Reeking black fumes emit
from the Waffle cookers. Chef

judges them almost done, Student,
now suffering from the combined
pangs of hunger and indigestion, be-
gins to mutter curses under his
breath.

8:20—The first of the waffles,
roasted to a golden black, emerge
from the cookers, but the server
won't bring any of them until the
last one is plopped on the tray.
Slater believes that if you can’t
do something right, you should do
anything at all. The student mean-
while becomes desperate, noting that
he has only five minutes until class
starts.

Ah, at Last
8:21—A waffle is finally plunked
on his plate (Oh, joy!) and the

unique clotting syrup slopped on top.
Notwithstanding the fact that they
have just been cooked, the waffles
are already icy cold. Student eager-
ly snatches his plate and settles at
the nearest table.

fork, and low and behold, there is a

8:22.5—His stomach churns and
heaves in open rebellion as the
student rushes to the fork dish and
hunts for a clean fork.

Malnutrition, and the Mad Dash

8:22.7—-Two and a quarter minutes
until the bell! The starving student
gulps down half of the waffle,
scraping off the scum forming on
the syrup’s surface. Grabbing a piece
of toast to devour en route, he
sprints out of the palatial dining
hall and runs toward the Science
Building at his top speed. By this
time, however, it’s no use—the stu-
dent is too weakened by malnutri-
tion to run very fast. He staggers in-
to class at 8:27, two minutes late,
with a black mark recorded against
him by his cranky professor and
swearing eternal vengance on the
Slater Food Management Service and
and all its hosts.

To Slaughters

For all the rest of the day, the
hungry student will gleefully medi-
tate on boiling all the Slater people
in their own syrup. All that night,
he will have pleasant dreams of
the pudgy chef served up on a
silver platter, surrounded by herbs
and vegetables, and with a large,
red apple in his mouth.

And I, for one, can’t blame him.

Letters To The Editor .. .

 

(Continued from page 2)

Needless to say, it all leads to, if
nothing else, very boring conversa-
tions. If then, for no other reason
than to make my own stay here a
little more interesting, I began to
look around for what I considered
worthwhile activities. Of course,
what is new to me may be already
well known to others and what I
say serve simply as commendation.

There are two groups of students
who have been making regular trips
to Western State Hospital at Staun-
ton to work with the mental pa-
tients. One of the groups under
Rev. Schnieder is already filled and
has undergone considerable train-
ing and experience at the hospital.
Another similar group headed by
Dr. Hodges which will probably be
going to Staunton on week-ends

 

could use more people in its pro-
gram.

Perhaps the most exciting of all}
developments are the recent meet-
ings that the independent students |
have held. While their unification
does have political significance, far
more important than becoming a}
puppet of our seemingly impotent |
political structure, such a union can)
offer an alternative to the fraternity |
monopoly on social life. Such a!
simple thing as getting cars for!
dates might now well be arranged. |
Also, an unaffiliated non-fraternity |
group might serve as a core around |
which to build a Washington and |
Lee spirit rather than simple loyal- |
ty to this or that fraternity. |
A philosophy group is meeting in
the Student Union Lounge; discus-
sions are conducted with Hollins, |
Sweet Briar, and Randolph-Macon;

dents pass out welfare food in Lex-

run very interesting programs—to
name afew more perhaps less known
happenings.

This so far has been my sphere of
interest and experience to fill the
void of Tweed Ring. Directed mainly
at students like myself who talk
of little more than transfers, I
simply state that there are many
worthwhile activities and people to
offset the humdrum life of “flick out”
and mud filled red squares.

Traditions Require Dissent
(Continued from page 2)

by constructive criticism and re-
evaluation.

It is for this reason that con-
structive and creative dissent is
absolutely nevessary in any kind of ;
free society. If conventional dress,
the “speaking tradition,’ or even
the Honor System cannot stand such
dissent, then they are certainly not
worthy of the name “tradition”;
this is, to be sure, not to undermine
their value, even when seen as
arbitrary rules. Before giving them
such an important role as “tradi- |
tions” in Washington and Lee, how- |
ever, let us first make sure that we |
have all the implications of such al
position clearly in mind.

private interviews. During both the*

morning and the afternoon, the visit-
ing students were taken to classes
and given tours of the W&L campus.

for candidates, but it is hoped that
some of the recipients may plan
eventual business careers.” Empha-
sis in selection of finalists is placed
on leadership and ability.

Five Robert E. Lee Scholarships
are awarded to incoming freshmen

 

 

each year. They carry stipends rang-

ing from $1,000 to $1,800 per year |

Engstrom Describes Poetry
Influenced By Synaesthesia

By JIM LEDBETTER

Alfred G. Engstrom, visiting lec- |
turer for the forty-fourth Seminars
in Literature under the sponsorship
of the Department of Romance
Languages, entertained a_ sizeable
crowd last Wednesday with a lec-
ture entitled “Synaesthesia and the
Poetic Imagination.

Although a rather imposing word,
the phenomenon of synaesthesia is a
commonly known occurence to psy-
chologists. It occurs when a stimulus
to one sense produces a concomi-
tant sensation in a sense not being
stimulated. Dr. Engstrom spent the
first part of his lecture giving il-
lustrations of this phenomenon. One
example was noted by William James
in The Unity of the Senses in which
a subject’s vision improved when a|
tuning fork was brought close to his|
ear, and there have been many cases |
that show a fluctuation of other |
senses when this is tried.

 

Sense Associations

Many people” report colored|
sounds—the linking of a color with al
word, vowel, or voices; tonal vision, |
gustatory sounds, gemoetric colors
and even numbers. Dr. Engstrom |
told of a friend of his who identified!
the number ninty-eight with “a “
|

 

woman wearing pince-nez and sing-
ing the Magnificat.”

The purpose of his lecture was to
establish the prevalance of synaes-
thesia in poetry. Dr. Engstrom con-
tended that in this case, as in many
others, literature had far preceded

Beginning with Homer, he
examples such “speech

moved to the Greek tragedians
where he found Aeschylus talking |
of “trumpets that set all the shores |

and especially the French Symbol- |
ists Baudelaire and Rimbaud. In|
Illuminations, the later noted the)
colors of vowels—A black, E while, |
I red, U green, and O blue.

Dr. Engstrom noticed that Shakes-
peare often made fun of this type
of metaphorical language, though he
often used it himself.

Taking several themes, such as
silence and the sun, Dr. Engstrom
showed the variety of synaesthetic
response to them through the ages.
Silence has been referred to as black
dark, perfumed, chilled, cold and
sealy, violet, among other things.

Several explanations for synaes-
thesia have been offered. Bacon
thought that in the evolution of
man from a simple organism that
possessed only one sensory apparat-
us, a common link was maintained
between the present senses. Another
theory maintains that the sensory
nerves are close together in the
brain; another, that the phenomonon
due to childhood conditioning,
such as colored lettering-blocks.

In conclusion, Dr. Engstrom point-
ed out that synaesthesia is far more

1S

 

than a non-lingustic, primitive re-
sponse, as some feel it to be, but!
the basis for much of man’s art!
and poetry.

Scientist Speaks

|Next Thursday

George Gaylord Simpson, one of
world’s foremost authorities on fos-

Inevitable.” Mr. Simpson is cur-
rently the Alexander Agassiz Pro-
fessor of Vertebrate Paleontology in
Harvard’s Museum of comparative
Zoology.

Before coming to Harvard in 1959,
he was Professor of Vertebrate
Paleontology at Columbia University
and Curator of Fossil Mammals and
Birds at the American Museum of
Natural History in New York, where
for more than thirty years he studied
and published on numerous series of
extinct vertebrates, ranging in time

years ago.

Mr. Simpson is well known for his
book, The Meaning of Evolution,
which has been translated into
French, German, and Italian, and
for numerous other publications. He
has received medals from seven dif-
ferent scientific societies, and is a
member of many such institutions
in London and here in the United
States. He holds honorary degrees
from Yale, Princeton, Durham, Ox-
ford, New Mexico, Glasgow, and
Chicago.

Thompson Service Held

A memorial service for Theodore
Thompson, Jr., a Washington and
Lee University sophomore who dis-
appeared last Wednesday while
swimming in the Mauray River here,
was held Tuesday night in his home-
town, Pelham, N. Y.

The service, beginning at 8:30 p.m.
at the Huguenot Memorial Church
in Pelham, was attended by repre-
sentatives of the university’s chap-
ter of Kappa Alpha, Thompson's so-
cial fraternity.

A Young Man’s Fancy...

Spring has always been viewed by man as the season of re-
birth, rejuvenation, gladness and panty raids.
But alas, the panty raid, and all that glorious tradition

behind it, has seen its day.

A whole new generation of college students has arisen

since that day—bettle-browed,
lectuals.

serious, grasping young intel-

Gone is the type of genius who a few years ago rewired
an entire school so that he singlehandedly controlled its entire
electrical supply. In his place is the double A plus student,
out to “make his mark on the world.”

Also gone is the type of enterprising young man, who,
some years ago at a mid-western college, was trying to suple-

ment his educational funds by

booking a burlesque queen to

appear during intermission at spring dances.

On the local scene things have changed too. Older heads
are often heard to remark how much the student body has
changed. It’s smarter, quieter—duller.

Even in the few years we've been here things have changed.
We remember fondly a friendly battle with the fire depart-
ment in which that freshman class was worsted.

But no more. The new breed of mature, intellectual stu-
dent looks down his nose at such as that, sneers and says—
“Umph! How much more fun to discuss God and sex and
solve world problems,” in the one night a week he allots to

such frivolity.

And so, there we are. Stuck with our pious pseudo little
intellect. What spawned him? That’s a bit hard to say. Perhaps
a similar mistaken sense of values that spawned his extreme

opposite.

However, lest anyone accuse us of seeking a regression—
well goodness sakes, that’s just the farthest thing from our
mind. And anyone who thought of a panty raid to Southern
Sem—to you, sir, horribly fearful remonstrations. Is that any

way for a W&L gentleman etc.,

etc.?

It just seemed to us this spring that there were one or two
things besides grades, but then that’s what spring does to one.

—C. C. F.

Dance teal Congratulated

Congratulations are in order for the Dance Board. They’ve
come up with a fine bill of entertainment for the Spring

Concerts.

This is not merely a gratuitous little slap on the back, but
sincerely meant. In the past there have been some pretty lousy
bills—perhaps unavoidable at times, but nevertheless we’ve

had them.

This Springs it should be different. If the entertainers live
up to their advance notices, we’re in for a fine weekend.

There’s something here to suit a variety of tastes. For the
folk music fans, there will be Odetta, a top artist in her field,
and the Journeymen. And for rock ’n roll fans Bo Diddley is

to play.

The second performer on the Saturday concert has not yet
been announced, but if he equals his fellow performers it will

be a top show.

Sem Quartet, Paramount Quintet
Comprise The Local Talent Finds

By PETE ALFORD

We feel we must report there ex-
ists a minor flourishing of singing

talent on the W&L

Se

r singing craze that
‘ the country is go-
* ing through has
- caused countless
numbers of imi-
tators to don
open sport shirts
and weejons, strap
a guitar around
their necks and
form a “group.”

Several of the
W&L variety folk singers have been
performing at the College Inn on
Friday nights and they have been
quite good. A quartet from Sem,
appropriately called The Hungry
Hill Singers has been booked for
tonight so the thing must be catch-
ing on.

Also Athletic Talent

Not only can the invigorating at-
mosphere of the Lexington area
bring out the singer in a person,
but also the athlete. Doing research
in the Paramount Inn the other
evening, we got to talking to Ron-
old Thompson, “player”-coach of the
Paramount's highly rated basketball
team.

Boasting an 18-1 win-loss record,
the quintet is presently competing in
the Y.M.C.A.’s gold medal cham-
pionship in Staunton. They have
captured two wins already in the
tourney and need only two more
to take the crown.

Boasts Three All-Staters

The team, which won last Wednes-
day 78-47 over a Charlottesville

campus. The folk
i

    

  

Alford

 

contingent, boasts of three former
B-V all-staters, former W&L play-
ers Mal Lassman, law student Jay
Gordon, and just recently Bip Faub-
er, in its ranks; also, guard Buck
Stimet, a B-V resident who will
have to leave the team for baseball
spring training in Florida. Stimet
is a pitcher for a double-A Phillies
farm club.

The Paramount five take the court
Monday in Staunton at the Y.M.C.A.
looking for another win which will
bring them closer to the title.

We trust our colleagues on the
Sports page aren’t offened that we
entered their realm for a paragraph
or two.

Forum Sertes
Is Sponsored

By Church

The Frontier Forums series at the
Lexington Presbyterian Church is
now half completed. The second
series of four meetings was held
Sunday.

The series consists of three dis-
cussion groups which meet at all
four programs. These discussions are
continuous, but they have enough
unity for each meeting to be com-
plete within itself.

Purpose of Forums

The purpose of the forums is to
enable students to discuss topics of
interest in small groups conducive
to participation. The forums are not
intended to give pat, pious answers
but to provide the opportunity for
intellectual exploration of current
situations.

“The World, the Word, and the
Sacrament” is led by Jim Campbell
with the Rev. L. W. Strickler serv-
ing as advisor. Based on In the
Middle of the World by Drew Uni-
versity’s Howard C. Kee, this forum
investigates the place of the church
in the twentieth century.

Church and Economics

“The Church and the Economic
Order” is directed by Pete Weaver

Editor's note: Robert Holland is
a senior journalism major at
Washington and Lee. His trip to
Washington was made possible by
a Reader's Digest travel grant to
the journalism department. A ful-
ler, more objective report of his
interviews appeared in last Sun-
day’s Richmond Times-Dispatch,
for which he is a local correspon-
dent. In this article he gives a
more personal report of his ex-
periences.

By ROBERT HOLLAND

A reporter inexperienced in the
mysterious ways of Washington’s
political thickets, yet covering a two-
day assignment there, may draw im-
mediate comparisons between the
capital city’s network of streets and
the hectic pace of our legislators’
daily routines.

Both bustle with seemingly end-|
less business, wind into confusing
circular patterns and (if slightly
cynical observations will be par-
doned) seem to lack a logical, com-
prehensible destiny.

Streets Do Lead Somewhere

But more practical persons tell us
that D.C.’s streets do indeed lead
somewhere other than original
starting points and that our friends
the politicians are masters of the
country’s destiny. Perhaps. At any
rate, my assignment as a neophyte
Washington reporter entailed finding
what, if anything, a small segment
of the political complex had on its
mind, namely the Virginia Congres-
sional delegation.

Senator Harry Flood Byrd, vari-
ously described by friends and foes
as the czar of the nefarious Byrd
Machine and the Grand Old Man
who devours wild-eyed liberals for
breakfast, was perusing a mass of
papers piled on his desk when this
reporter wandered into view. He was
consuming neither Berryville apples
or wild-eyed liberals.

Byrd Tired

 

He did seem tired. Thirty years
of fighting the political wars cer-

tainly entitle anyone to a fair share
of gray hair and wrinkled brow.

Cautiously I asked the Senator
the question all Virginia wants to
know: Will Harry Byrd be a can-
didate for re-election in 1964? And
he gently gave me the answer being
dished out to other reporters, young
and old alike—‘“I haven’t decided.”

He expressed the opinion that Vir-
ginia voters are conservative, will
remain conservative and, implicitly,
will remain in the conservative Dem-
ocratic camp. After discussing his
opposition to Democratic President
Kennedy's budget, medicare and
mental health proposals and various
and sundry other programs, it was
off to a committee meeting to tangle
with liberals for Virginia’s senior
Senator and off to another office
for the reporter.

In House Office Building

Across the way, in the House of
Representatives Office Building the
reporter found a_ strange young
Congressman by the name of W. Pat
Jennings of the Ninth District. Jen-
nings, by Virginia standards, had
some almost subversive things to
say. He dared to suggest that the
state re-examine its traditional pay-
as-you-go policies, that state Dem-
ocrats should also be national Dem-
ocrats, and that (horror of horrors)
Virginia has its problems.

“We need a more vigorous party,
with wider participation. We are not
appealing to younger people. We
need more vigor in presenting the
image of the present party,” (Where
have we heard about vigor before?).

A handsome, vigorous young man,
Jennings is considered as one of the
leaders in a movement to orient
state Democrats toward a more pro-
gressive frame of mind. Whether he
will succeed or not may be de-
cided by the upcoming elections in
which the poll tax should be gone
from the scene, along with blank
paper registration. An increase in
the number of voting Virginians may
be the wedge for political change.

Judge Howard Smith
The last man in the world who

 

Student Reporter In D.C.
Interviews State Solons

would agree with Jennings also oc-
cupies an office in the House Office
Building. He’s Judge Howard W.
Smith, the cagey, aged Congress-
man from the Eighth District who
runs a corollary agency of Con-
fress known as the House Rules
Committee.

He, like Byrd, informed me that
the people of the state are conser-
vative, love the Byrd organization,
and want to live blissfully in a
balanced budget.

“We don’t want to do a lot of
the theoretical experimenting the
White House is recommending,”

Smith said.

To emphasize his point, he picked
up a copy of the President’s budget,
acidly remarked that it went on
and on for something like 1200 pages,
and shoved it aside to a corner of
his desk. The reporter got a distinct
impression that Smith would like
to eliminate approximately nine-
tenths of the budget.

Robertson of Lexington

Senator Byrd’s cohort, junior Sen-
ator A. Willis Robertson of Lexing-
ton, also looked with disfavor on
re-organizing the state party for
the logical reason that he, Senator
Robertson has been elected to every
office he has run for on the Dem-
ocratic ticket since 1915 and there-
fore “I would be the last to say
that I’m dissatisfied with the party
and want it reorganized.”

Who said Washington and Lee has
a monopoly on “gravy train” poli-
tics?

The other Congressmen were help-
ful and courteous to the wandering
reporter, as were all of our Vir-
ginians in Washington. However,
their remarks were _ predictably
“Byrdian,” for the most part.

With enough material to write a
story for his newspaper, the weary
reporter struggled to find his way
out of the maze of capital building
subways, dodged the droves of tur-
ists, got lost for more than an hour
in Washington traffic, and finally
found the road to Lexington.

 

By JOHN KIRKLEY

Freedom and service are two sep-
arte and distinct concepts; yet they
can, and should, be seen as inter-
related and even mutually depen-
dent.

In his book, Escape from Freedom,
Dr. Erich Fromm points out tht the
conditions of modern civilization
affect man in two ways: we become
more independent, self-reliant, and
critical, and at the same time we
become more isolated, alone and
afraid. Without going to the extreme
of viewing history as man’s struggle
for freedom and _ individuality, one
would have to admit that through
the centuries men in general have
become more and more free from ex-
ternal domination.

Men in industrialized, “modern”
nations are no longer controlled by
irrational fears of the unknown. Our
society is not completely regulated
by external authority as were the
civilizations of the Egyptians, the
Mayas, and Incas. Our lives are not
directed by external authority,
whether it be of church or state, or
by tradition, a form of control found
in most “primitive” or small, iso-
lated cultures.

Besides gaining freedom from ex-
ternal authority, men have also
gained a large measure of freedom
from compulsive or conditioned in-
ternal control. The inner-directed
man of the American frontier days
is no longer with us. Today, through
psychoanalysis, psychology, sociolo-
gy, and other studies, men are be-
coming more aware of themselves;
we can discover the mainsprings of
our actions and can then eriticize
ourselves and attempt to alter the
course of our lives by changing our
thoughts and deeds.

Thus modern men find themselves

 

 

in a situation of “freedom from”—

 

 

they have freedom from imposed
external authority, irrational fears,
and compulsive inner direction. But
this condition of freedom is a fright-
ening one; for when one comes to see
himself as being distinct from other
individuals and the world in gen-
eral, that is, not merely a discrete
physical entity, but a unique person,
similar to but different from his
fellows, he is often overwhelmed by
doubts and fears, a raging insecuri-
ty and aloneness; in isolation, one
becomes afraid. This increasing iso-
lation and the intense’ feeling of
aloneness which result from it. is
the basis of the existentialist predic-
ament.

Now if one finds himself in the
position of “freedom from” and iso-
lation, what can he do? The over-
whelming desire of a person in this
condition is to find security and re-
lief, to become re-oriented to the
world in a meaningful way. There
are two basic ways to do this: one
results in continued frustration, the
other in the fullest possible develop-
ment of the individual and_ his
unique emotional, sensual, and intel-
lectual potentialities.

The first way to find security is
to attempt to escape from freedom.
One can do this by submitting him-
self to an external, authoritarian
control, as men do when they devote
themselves to a cause, blindly and
irrationally, in an attempt to find a
meaning in life and an individual
importance by drowning themselves
in some “higher” effort; the cause
or external authority may be an au-
thoritarian regime which parades it-
self as representing the inevitable
march of history, or it might be sub-
mission to a God or religion which
dogmatically asserts that it has “the
Answer,” etc.

A second escape is destructiveness

 

A Modern Man’s Dilemma:
The Escape From Freedom

or, as Karen Horney calls it, aggres-
sion; one gains a feeling of super-
iority over something by destroying
or damaging it, by asserting one’s
control over it. The third form of
escape, and the one which Fromm
asserts to be dominant in America,
is automation conformity; the con-
formity may be to specific condi-
tions, rules, or regulations or to an
anonymous authority which is large-
ly an imaginative one composed of
the dictates of the mass media and
“other-direction.” In this latter case,
the individual would regulate his
behavior according to what he
thought the “others” expected him to
do; he would act if he thinks the
“others” would approve and would
inhibit action or feel guilty about
acting if he thought they would dis-
approve.

Above I said that these were “at-
tempts” to escape; they are merely
attempts and not actual escapes, be-
cause they are not psychologically
satisfying to the individual. The per-
son who escapes to authoritarianism,
destruction or aggresison, or con-
formity, can never be satisfied by
this condition, for he still realizes, or
at least feels, senses, that his true
self, his individuality, is being in-
hibited repressed, suppressed, dom-
inated by other forces. Having tasted
freedom, one cannot be satisfied
without it.

The other way to become re-ori-
ented to the world when one finds
himself in a position of “freedom
from” and isolation is this: one must
realize tht he is a free, unique indi-
vidual and make the free and ra-
tional choice, based on knowledge,
to relate himself voluntarily to the
world and to his fellow men through
love and work. In freedom, one must
have the courage to accept the re-

Marshall Research Library

The Ford Foundation has an-
nounced a gift of $200,000 to the
George Marshall Research Founda-
tion for use by the projected Mar-
shall Research Library when com-
pleted.

The grant is the largest yet made
to the foundation since its estab-
lishment ten years ago. The founda-
tion established in memory of the
late George C. Marshall has re-
ceived nearly $1 million in gifts.

The terms of the Ford Foundation
grant stipulated that the money is
to be used for research into United
States military and diplomatic his-
tory.

At present the foundation has ap-
proximately $450 available toward
construction of the library to be
built near the Virginia Military In-
stitute parade grounds. Marshall was
a VMI graduate.

Construction work on the library
is due to begin this spring with
completion expected by June 1 next
year.

“When I used to walk from spot
to spot looking for work,” he re-
calls, “everybody played like T-
Bone Walker and those cats, so I
tried for something different.”

The result is what critic Marjorie
Williams calls, “the pure, primitive
rhythm that can only be an inherent
quality, and not a studied style.”
His style ranges from calypso to
the simple anecdotal, often based
on the “shave and a haircut, six bits”
phrase.

to do what we ought.” There are
some tricky issues here, but it is a
statement worth pondering. Basically
this is the problem: in freedom one
can make choices; the choices are
these—one may attempt to escape the
burden of freedom, which choice
leads to further frustration; he may
choose to do nothing (this is the
freedom not to choose), which so-
lution leads to the despair of un-
bearable isolation; and, finally there
is the choice to accept oneself as
a unique being, to affirm the social
nature and brotherhood of all men,
and to relate oneself freely and
and spontaneously to others through
love and work.

It is only by choosing this third
course, by choosing service to others
as a way of life, as did Faust, that
one may maintain his freedom and
individuality and attain the satis-
faction of personal creativity and
helping others develop their full
sensual, emotional, and intellectual
potentialities.

Springs For 1963 Features
‘Holiday In Havana’;
Isley Brothers To Perform

The theme for Springs Weekend is ‘Holiday in Havana,”
Frank Young, President of the Dance Board, announced last

night.

The theme, Young said, will be similar to last year’s Carib-

bean setting.

The Dance Board further announced the signing | of the

Isley Brothers for Saturday night of* ———-—

springs. The trio will appear in the
same concert with Bo Diddley.

The Isley brothers came to New
York early in 1958 to get their start,
and a year later they had been
signed up by one of the most im-
portant agencies in the business—
General Artists Corporation. It
wasn't long after that RCA took
them on where they produced “Turn
to Me” and “I’m Gonna Knock on
Your Door.” They were recognized
as top competitors in the field of
rock and roll and as evidence they
produced “Shout.”

Their success story began long
before they began school. They had
started singing in church activities
and entered small-town contests.
They eventually earned enough
money to make the move to New
York. Their first year there was
their only hard one, but they finally

got their chance with General
Artists.
Last year’s Springs initiated a

move toward fewer dances and more
concerts and no dance on Spring’s
Weekend.

Friday night's concert will be high-
lighted by the appearance of Odetta
and the Journeymen,

Odetta is hailed as one of the
truly great contemporary artists not
only in the folk-singing field but
also in the blues field. She has
played night clubs from “The Hun-
gry i” in San Francisco to the “Blue
Angel” in New York City. She pres-
ently records for RCA, and has
several albums.

Odetta will be followed by the
Journeymen, whose single, “Kum-
bahya” was on the top ten lists
for several weeks. They are equally
adept at pop ballards, blues and
modern jazz, although they are best
known for their folk music.

The group consists of John Phil-
lips, Richard Weismann, and Scott
McKenzie. Phillips, the acknow-
ledged leader of the group, was an
all state basketball and track star
at UVa. and then at George Wash-
ington University. The Journeymen
were discovered by Frank Weber,
the manager of the ever-popular
Kingston Trio. The concert will be
held from 8-10 Friday evening.

According to Mike Jenkins, Vice
President in charge of decorations,
the gym will be decorated with palm
trees and tropical scenes going along
with the theme of “Holiday in Ha-
vanna.” Jenkins added that he will
try to catch the beauty and splen-
dor of the tropical isle in decorations,
the beauty that makes it a “perfect
place to spend a holiday.”

 

The figure will also be presented
on Friday night, introducing the
President of Springs, Ed Croft, and
his vice presidents. According to
Croft, the figure is going to be a
departure from the traditional fig-
ures, but he declined to say speci-
fically what it is to consist of.

Saturday night’s concert is direct-
ed toward the fans of Rock 'n Roll,
with the appearance of Bo Diddley
and the Isley Brothers. Both will
be playing in fraternity houses after
the concert is over.

Bo Diddley was brought to fame
largely on the strength of his 1955
hit entitled “Bo Diddley,” which is,
played today by many
throughout the country. A string of
hit singles and albums has kept Bo
Diddley and his group near the top
of the ladder in the entertainment
business.

KA’s | Cancil
Cocktail Party

For Memorial

Art Broadus, president of KA,
announced last night that KA has
decided to cancel the cocktail party
which was to be held Friday after-
noon of Spring’s Dances in honor
of Ed Croft, President of this year’s
dance set. Instead of holding the tra-
ditional cocktail party, the funds
will be used to institute a memorial
fund in the name of Ted Thompson,
Jr., KA sophomore, who drowned
in a swimming accident on March 13.
He also stated that contributions
from members of the student body
to the memorial fund will be wel-
comed.

Broadus added, “Speaking on be-
half of the house as a whole, we
would like to thank all those who
have helped us in the past two
weeks. We owe a great debt to the
faculty, students, and rescue units
from Lexington and_ surrounding
communities.”

Graveside services for the 19-year-
old pre-med student are being held
this week at Ferncliff Cemetery in
Pelham, New York, with only mem-
bers of the immediate family present.
Memorial services were held last
Tuesday with several members of
KA attending.

Thompson’s body was recovered
Saturday morning on a mid-stream
island which had been covered by

must invent a new,
unprecedented “social mechanism”
that will compel broadcasters to
serve the intelligent public interest
as a part of the nation’s “pluralistic
system of education,” a noted au-
thority on the mass media said in
Washington Monday night.

Gilbert Seldes, dean of the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania’s Annen-
berg School of Communications and
a noted television critic, said the
creation of such mechanism is work
for trained minds. But he added that
the device would be effective only
if it involved the general public
in “an intelligent use of their pow-
er.”

addressed the 21st annual
awards dinner of the Alfred I.
duPont Awards Foundation which
recognizes radio and television sta-
tions and commentators for superior
broadcasting in the public interest.

Honored as duPont winners for
1962 at the dinner were stations
WFMT (FM) of Chicago and KVOA-
TV of Tucson, Arizona, and com-
mentator Howard K. Smith of the
American Broadeasting Company.
Only three duPont awards are given
annually, to a relatively large sta-
tion, a relatively small station, and
a commentator.

 

President Fred C. Cole of Wash-
ington and Lee University, chairman
of the duPont Foundation’s awards
committee, made the presentation
of engrossed plaques and $1,000
checks to winners at a dinner held
at Washington’s Mayflower Hotel.
Leaders of the broadcasting indus-
try and related government agencies
joined the duPont committee in
honoring the 1962 winners at the
awards event.

Accepting the duPont Awards for
1962 tonight were Barnard Jacogs,
president of Gale Broadcasting Co.,
Ine., owner of WFMT; Gordon FE,
Hamilton, station manager of KVOA-

TV; and Mr. Smith.
The Alfred I. duPont Awards
Foundation in the field of Radio,

television, and the allied sciences,
was created in 1942 by Mrs. Jessie
Ball duPont in memory of her hus-
band, the late Alfred I. duPont, a
noted scientist and industrialist. The
foundation’s annual awards seek to
recognize “outstanding and meritor-
ious service in encouraging, foster-
ing, promoting, and developing
American ideals of freedom, and for
loyal and devoted service to the na-
tion and to the communities served
by these stations and commentators.”

The 1963-64 edition of the Univer-
sity Catalogue is undergoing several
important revisions, Frank Parsons,
Director of Information announced
today.

The purpose of the changes, Par-
sons stated, is to make the Catalogue
more effective in its two services as
both an introduction to the Univer-
sity for prospective freshmen and
as a handbook to currently enrolled
students.

The Catalogue will be divided into
seven major sections. One of the
principal innovations is represented
by the first section, entitled Infor-
mation for Prospective Freshmen.
This section is divided into the fol-
lowing topics: “Some Purposes of a
Good College,” “The Growth of Two
Centuries,” “The University Today,”
“The Academic Program,” and “Stu-
dent Life.”

The remaining sections are as fil-
lows: Rules and Regulations, The
College, The School of Commerce
and Administration, Courses of In-
struetion, The School of Law, and
General Information and Matters of
Record.

The overall design of the Catalogue
will also be revised, Parsons stated.
The book will be larger in width,
length and thickness. A_ pictorial
cover will replace the solid blue
design. On the front will appear a
duotone picture of the university's
colonnade and an aerial view of the
campus will be represented on the
back.

The printing will be changed from
letterpress to offset, which will pro-

W&L Sinai Groups
To Travel Over Vacation

By HEAD NEWMAN
For Spring Vacation the general
trend is to the South. This trend in-
cludes 3 groups of Washington and
Lee students who are going to
make their vacation worth while.
These groups are the Sabers, the

Sazeracs and the Waysiders.

The Sazeracs will journey to Palm
Beach, Florida. There they will be
singing at the Taboo Club on Worth
Avenue in Palm Beach. The group
will be staying at the Biltmore and
have hopes of entertaining there,
also. The Sazeracs have been aided
in Palm Beach by a W&L alumni,
Bev Smith. As an added note of
interest, the Sazeracs have mentioned
making a record, but it is only a
vision right now and there are no
definte plans whatsover.

The Sabers are going to play at
Chapel Hill, North Carolina, Satur-
day night, and from there they will
journey to Sea Island, Georgia. They
have an engagement Monday night
at the Beach House, at the Cloister
Hotel.

The Waysiders, a folk singing
group that has performed several
times in the Lexington area plans
to go North for the vacation and has
an engagement at the Flambeau in
Baltimore. The group is made up of
Jim Ledbetter, Dave Trussell, with
an occasional appearance by Sam
| Simpson .

vide for more photographs and “e
more attractice appearance,” Par-
sons remarked.

The pictures will be more numer-
ous and will be in black and white.

“The major feature of the new
Catalogue,” Parsons explained, “is
the separation of the rules and regu-
lations from the description of the
university.” The separation was made
for the convenience of incoming
freshmen.

Parsons added that the new Cata-
logue was just one step of a multi-
stage plan which the Administra-
tion is initiating. The ultimate ob-
jective, Parsons intimated, is the
separation of the Catalogue into
two books, one for prospective fresh-
men and one for students of the
university.

Parsons stated that the new Cata-
logue should be available late in
April.

 

N FU Replaced
By New Group

The University’s Non-Fraternity
Union has been supplanted by a new
organization, Bill Lowry, senior, an-
nounced today.

The new organization is called the
Independent Union. It is the product
of a caucus meeting of non-frater-
nity students who assembled in
February of this year. A Steering
Committee was elected to organize
the details of the union and plan a
general program.

The members of the Steering Com-
mittee are Bill Lowry, senior, Rod
Cockshutt and Matt Hulbert, juniors;
Shannon Jung and Andy Stone,

sophomores; Gene Hatfield and Lew | —

Davis, freshmen.

“The primary function of the
Union” stated Cockshutt, “is to or-
ientate student activity more toward
the student body as a whole and
less on fraternities.”

The Union, Cockshutt added, will
not be exclusively non-fraternity.

At present, the organization has
a membership of some fifty students.

It resolved at a meeting held
earlier this month tht it would adopt
a non-alignment policy far as
politics were concerned. As soon as
the University and
Parties announce their candidates,
the Union will pledge its support to
one of the slates.

The Independent Union also in-
tends to field teams in all intra-
mural sports as part of | its program.

remarks that his private activities
“are of no particular interest ex-
cept to his wife, two children, a
few other well-chosen relatives and
friends, and to the anxious conduc-

The convocation on April 12, at
noon in duPont Auditorium, open

new initiates into Phi Beta Kappa,
but also commemorates the generos-

to the university, made in 1796, was
in the form of 100 shares of valuable
canal stock.

There will be an initiation for
new members of Phi Beta Kappa on

The Freshman Elective

An action of the Faculty Committee on Courses and De-
grees has made it possible for the W&L freshman in future
years to elect one sophomore course. This course may come
from the field of sociology, political science, philosophy, re-
ligion, psychology, and some others. The only stipulation is
that the chosen course have no prerequisites. Any freshman
may do this regardless of his placement scores.

The object of this move is not, as some have thought, to
move a freshman along more quickly. Indeed, whatever fresh-
man course an incoming student may waive in preference for
for an elective must be made up in his sophomore year. If a
freshman elected to take sophomore philosophy in his freshman
year instead of math, for example, he would have to take the

math in his sophomore year.

The purpose of the plan, rather, is to give the freshman an
opportunity to investigate a field in which he is particularly in-
terested without having to wait until his sophomore year. Also,

it will alleviate the tedium which

elementary courses. The W&L Freshman year has been in
the past, as rigid a schedule as one could imagine. The variety
which this plan offers to the freshman, while not revolutionary,
is certainly a step toward a more stimulating freshman course of

study.

It should also be pointed out that the elective program is
separate from the placement program, which provides a means
for talented freshmen to skip History 1 and 2, and English 1,
depending on placement scores.
an intelligent freshman to move into sophomore history and
math, into whatever language level his placement scores allow,
and into English 2, and in addition take a sophomore elective

course.

Year's Ten Best Movies
Include Lolita, The Night

By TOM PACE

With little ado I will select those
films which I believe were the finest
of the year.

In evaluating them I paid no at-
tention to the importance of the
content or message in the film.
Rather, I tried to decide what the
director’s intentions were, to consid-
er the treatment which he gave
them, and to ascertain how well he
succeeded. The directors’ names are
in parentheses.

The Night

1. The Night (Michelangelo Anto-
nioni)—The only film which I
thought was a complete success, it is
concerned with the incommunicabil-
ity of man. Antonioni’s subtle, slow,
precise style is a marvel by itself,

 

and was particularly effective in this

film. The movie starred three of
icaEurope’s best: Jeanne Moreau,
Monica Vitti and Marcello Mastro-
ianni.

2. Lolita—(Stanley Kubrick)—
Krubrick seems to me the finest
American director. This film posses-
ses an aura of sophistication which
I found unparalleled in my viewing.
It was easily the funniest film that
I have ever seen. Unfortunately this
was its only weakness. It was too
comic to deal with its subject suc-
cessfully. James Mason’s perform-
ances was the finest of the year, and
Nelson Riddle’s music was little
short of ingenious.

faut)—Truffaut may be the best di-

By BILL LOWRY
and ROD COCKSHUTT

With the ever-increasing demand
for a first-class higher education,
and with more and more qualified
applicants thinking about Washing-
ton and Lee each year, no one can
deny that it is extremely important
to keep on our toes, as far as the
academic side of campus life is con-
cerned. Washington and Lee has
been, and is, for the most part, doing
its best to meet these demands, as
is seen by some of the revisions tak-
ing place in the curriculum next
year. At the same time, it is import-
ant that we always consider new
ideas in order to insure the same
high quality undergraduate educa-
tion for which we have been known,
and, if at all possible, to improve it
as much as possible. The following
proposals are presented, therefore,
not so much with the idea of critic-
izing existing policies, but in the
spirit of enriching the academic and
intellectual side of Washington and
Lee life.

Revamping Freshman Program

The logical place to begin any dis-
cussion of our academic emphasis
is the incoming freshman, as it is
these students who are demanding
more and more in the way of a col-
lege education; this brings us at
W&L to the subject of Freshman
Camp. If space and time permit-
ted, much could, of course, be
found to criticize the way this
program has been in the past; suffice
it to say now, however, that the
emphasis at Freshman Camp has not
exactly been in the direction of ori-
enting new students to the academic
discipline which should be demand-
ed by Washington and Lee.

Freshman Reading List

In looking at the programs of other
colleges and universities we find that
Washington and Lee is one of the
few major Universities which does
not have a summer reading program
for incoming freshmen. Our pro-
posal, therefore, is that a list of ap-
proximately five books, the nature of
which will be discussed below, be
sent to incoming freshmen, with fa-
cilities made available for provid-
ing such books through the Univer-
sity.

Freshmen will be expected to have
read the books before arriving in
Lexington, and the reading would
be used to form the basis for dis-
cussions at Freshman Camp; various
professors, familiar with the fields
covered in the reading could give

short lectures, and the Camp Coun-

sellors themselves would be respon-
sible for holding smaller discussions.
Thus, from the very beginning of
a student’s freshman year, the world
of ideas would be an existing reality.
University-Wide List

At the same time, such a program
might not be a bad one to establish
on a University-wide basis. If every
student would read five books in
common with the rest of the Student
Body during summer vacation, a
basis for discussion would be pro-
vided which would link the entire
University Community, regardless of
major or school, unifying them to-
wards a general academic outlook.

Various seminars, lectures and dis-
cussions could then be held periodi-
cally through the academic year,
making use of the various ideas
brought out in the reading. Experts
in the fields under discussion could
then come to campus and speak to
an audience with at least a minimum
acquaintance with the particular
field under discussion; it might even
be possible to get the authors of
some of the books themselves on
campus for a few days to hold sem-
inars and give lectures.

Furthermore, in the classroom, in-
structors could also assume a famil-
iarity with the works, thus being
able to rely upon them for illus-
trations and examples relevant to
their own subject.

Unifying Effect

By far the greatest value of such
a program, however, would be the
unifying effect that it would have
on the University as a whole, bring-
ing together all of the various dis-
ciplines, thus bridging some of the
gaps between the Science School, the
Liberal Arts School and the Com-
merce School, and providing as well
a common intellectual background
for all students, regardless of per-
sonal and social preference. Such a
program has been tried at at least
one University—Franklin and Mar-
shall College—with what appears to
be a good deal of success; we see
no reason why it would not be ef-
fective here as well.

Faculty Committee

The books to be discussed would
be selected by a faculty commit-
tee, and would perhaps consist of
five books, from as many different
fields.

We suggest at least one book of
general educational importance, such
as C. P. Snow’s The Two Cultures
and the Scientific Revolution, or

 

one of the Conant studies of Amer-

ican Education; one book drawn
from the field of the social sciences,
such as The Lonely Crowd, Norman
Brown’s Life Against Death, or
Erich Fromm’s Escape from Free-
dom; one book drawn from contem-
porary British or, preferably, Amer-
ican fiction, such as Rabbit, Run,
Lord of the Flies; Catch 22, or A
Long and Happy Life; one work
numbered among the “great clas-
sies,’ such as Plato’s Republic or
Dante’s Divine Comedy; and one
book drawn from the fields of eco-
nomics and political science, such
as Galbraith’s Affluent Society, or
Michael Harrington’s The Other
American.

Of course, in picking these books,
it would be best to choose those
readily available in paperback, and
the University Supply Store or the
Book Shop on Washington Street
could then order the required num-
ber, so as to make them available
before summer vacation. The admin-
istrative details seem slight indeed,
in comparison with the rich intel-
lectual rewards which could be of-
fered by such programs, both in
terms of incoming freshmen, and in
terms of the Academic Community
as a whole.

Recognize Professors

Our third proposal is not so much
a means of stimulating academic

 

awareness as one of recognizing

Revisions In Curriculum Suggested
To Accent Emphasis On Academics

that which already exists; by rec-
ognizing those outstanding faculty
members who have contributed so
much to make the intellectual life
at Washington and Lee what it is.

We propose, therefore, to have the
student body, at, say, the time of
the general student body elections,
be allowed to vote for the best pro-
fessor in the following categories:
1) most dedicated professors; 2) the
professor most approachable by stu-
dents; 3) the most brilliant lecturer
and classroom personality; 4) the
most scholarly professor; and 5) the
best new professor.

After the final choices have been
determined, the honored professors
would then be awarded a plaque
or scroll, or some other suitable
award, by the student body, work-
ing through the Executive Commit-
tee. Most of our professors are com-
petent, and many are outstanding;
such a recognition of their con-
tributions to Washington and Lee
seems only fair.

Workable Proposals

The above proposals are all work-
able, and would require very simple
machinery to put into reality. We
have done a lot academically on this
campus, but we still have a long
way to go. Such proposals as the
above seem to be in the best inter-

 

Dorm Cones) Applications

ests of all concerned.

To Be Submitted By April 20

Applications are invited for the
position of Freshman Dormitory
Counselors for the 1963-64 academic
year. Dormitory Counselors can be
of great assistance in aiding the
adjustment required of freshmen.
For this reason these positions are
considered to be among the most re-
sponsible entrusted to Washington
and Lee students.

Certain guidelines for the selection
of Dormitory Counselors have been
set up on the basis of past exper-
ience. Applicants must be at least
current sophomores, and should not
have routine commitments after
8:00 p.m. that would normally take
a Counselor from the dormitory for
any appreciable time. While Coun-
selorships are not awarded on an
academic basis, a student who has
failed to maintain a C average would
probably not be selected.

The awards of Counselorship are
not based on financial need. How-

Letters Take Issue With Traditions, ‘Cool Stud,’ And

Which Are More Valuable?

To the Editor,
Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

With reference to the following
passage in the Editorial of last Tues-
day’s Ring-tum Phi:

“..,the tradition of conventional
dress is too valuable to W&L to
be abandoned or even weakened.
And the Assimilation Committee is
doing its job too well to be swept
aside at the behest of young phil-
osophers and outraged individual-
ists, whose philosophy consists of
not cutting their hair, whose indi-
viduality consists of not wearing
socks, and who are far less valu-
able to Washington and Lee than
the tradition they flout.”

We could hardly care less about
cutting hair or not wearing socks,
but we are two “young philosophers”
who certainly are “outraged” with
the sentiments expressed in the edi-
torial quoted above.

The idea that any tradition is more
valuable than the individual dignity
of a human being is both repugnant
and obseene. Traditions exist to
serve us, and we refuse to become
the slaves of any sacred cow, no
matter what majority may support
it, no matter what institution is be-
hind it.

When are we going to wake up?

Sincerely yours,

PAUL R. COCKSHUTT, JR.

Alumnus Blasts Commons

Lexington, Va.
Dear Sir:

Congratulations to Don Casto for
his BLAST at the Freshman Com-
mons. Most of the students now on
campus did not experience the W&L
of pre-commons days and I am glad

 

a current freshman can see the dis-
advantages of the Commons.

I am one of many alumni who
complained bitterly about the Com-
mons from the time it was first ru-
mored in 1954, and I am still com-
plaining about it.

The University has justified the

Commons on these questionable
points:
(1) It is desirable to have all
Freshmen eat together for class
unity.

(2) It is needed for non-fraternity
students.

I think it is ridiculous to say that
the Commons is required for class
unity when without the Commons,
freshmen already lived together and
went to classes together for possibly
12 hours per day (excluding sleeping
time.) How can an additional 114-
2 hours per day at meals be import-
ant enough to justify this concen-
tration-camp type existence (wheth-
er the food is good or bad)?

As respects non-fraternity stu-
dents, at one time the University
managed quite well with a smaller
Dining Hall run by the University,
and I see no reason why something
similar for Law Students and NFU’s
could not be used today. Let’s also
keep in mind that the NFU’s are
that by choice. They prefer to stay
out of groups or they would have
pledged a fraternity (in my opinion
any freshman who really wants to
join a fraternity can do so at W&L).
So is it logical to encourage them
to group together for eating pur-
poses? I think it is clear that the
NFU’s, as a group, do not require
or justify the Commons.

IN MY OPINION, THE COM-
MONS WAS BUILT ONLY FOR
ONE REASON—TO INTENTION-
ALLY WEAKEN THE FRATERNI-
TIES. The effect was not immediately
and equally serious for all fraterni-
ties, but over a period of years the
fraternity group WILL be seriously
affected. And, of greater importance,

this is just one of other moves that
can affect fraternities, such as:

(1) Deferred Rushing—this has
been publicized seriously each year
since the Commons appeared. Could
it be that this comes up as a result
of some quiet word dropped by a
member of the Administration or
Faculty?

(2) Should deferred rush _ be
adopted, then several fraternities will
be in financial difficulty. At this
point the University has to take
drastic action and all students are
moved into University dormitories.

(3) Complete abolishment of fra-
ternities may then take place.

There are many colleges with
dorms for all students. But that

doesn’t mean that EVERY college
should be on a 100 per cent dormi-
tory basis. One of the strengths of
higher education in the USA is the
great diversity of institutions. W&L
is different in many respects, one of
which is that fraternities rave fed
and housed most students and have a
great part of the so-called assimila-
tion. This is one of the great bene-
fits of W&L—let’s keep it that way.
Why must we copy Harvard, Am-
herst or Kenyon? W&L students
have traditionally had a_ large
amount of freedom. The fraternity
system has permitted this.

The Commons has not yet “stran-
gled” fraternities, but it has affected
every one. Freshmen Gareth Aden
has stated that “the change was
made smoothly with the fraternities
merely preparing less food than be-
fore.” That is an incorrect state-
ment. I belong to a typical fraternity
at W&L and the Commons required

 

 

 

tions including the elimination of at
least one employee. I estimate that
freshmen constitute roughly 30 per
cent of the total quantity of per-
sons in the typical W&L chapter,
and when you suddenly eliminate
that volume of certain income (and
certain profit), there must be a sig-
nificant adjustment.

Obviously, each fraternity has
been affected differently. No two
houses have identical financial sit-
uations. But the typical fraternity
at W&L is not as well off as 5 years
ago. The unusually large number
of fraternities at W&L makes them
more vulnerable to financial adver-
sities. W&L’s ratio of 18 fraternities
for 1,000 undergraduates is among

 

the highest in the country.

The fraternities have definitely
suffered from this change and will
feel it more each year. In effect,
W&L built the Commons (at a cost
of $75,000) at the expense of the fra-
ternities—financially and psycholog-
ically.

The freshmen, according to Don
Casto, are not being assimilated
properly now. According to what I
have read in the Ring-tum Phi for
the past three years, I believe that
is correct. There have been many
evidences of increasing opposition
to W&L traditions and less satis-
faction by the students generally
with the entire University. In my
opinion, much of this unrest can be
attributed to the elimination of the
fraternity influence on the freshmen.
I, personally, got more out the fra-
ternity my freshman year than any
other year. Each fraternity is not
perfect and can be improved, but

a substantial change in our opera-! there is every reason to expand the

influence of fraternities, not weaken
it.

So, we have this monstrosity,
benefitting no group, weakening the
fraternities, creating problems, ruin-
ing appetites, encouraging ulcers.
This monstrosity cost $750,000.00—
money that should have been used
for educational facilities. The Uni-
versity is constantly besieging the
alumni, parents, friends, founda-
tions, ete. for funds, and the “hill”
has the amazing idea that $750,000
can be spared for this monument
which may eventually be a grave-
stone for all or part of the W&L
fraternity organization.

I might add that neither the Ad-
ministration nor the Board of Trus-
tees sampled alumni opinion on this
revolutionary change. In fact, alum-
ni opinion has not been sampled on
any matter in the past 15 years. How
about that for keeping the public
happy?

Pseudo Knocks Coolism

Cool Stud, C.C.F.,

They are not long, the days of wine
and roses...
And panty raids.

So “our pious pseudo little intel-
lect” is taking over is he? And Lex-
ington is getting quiet and dull, and
you would probably like to see him
take his toys and “mistaken sense of
values” and go play someplace else.
You big, Joe-College, neat fellow,
who mourns for the good ole days
and cries over this new generation
of phonies. I pity you.

In your editorial you allude to this
sort of individual as discussing “God
and sex and solving world prob-
lems in the one night a week he
allots to such frivolity.” First I
would like to compliment your sub-
tle sarcasm. It’s really pretty clever.

 

But what about the “God and sex

 

 

ever, in order to ensure the greatest
possible contact with freshmen,
Counselors are provided with a
single room in the dormitory and
the dinner meal in the Commons,
which they are expected to eat with
freshmen.

The primary basis of selection of
Counselors will be that of general
fitness to aid in making the Fresh-
man Dormitory an adequate envir-
onment for a_ student’s freshman
year.

Applications should be filed in the
Office of the Dean of Students by
Saturday, April 20, 1963, and should
include information that will be
helpful to the Selection Committee.
Further details concerning duties
and responsibilities can be obtained
from Phil Sharp, Head Dormitory
Counselor, and Kemp Morton or
Bob Payne, Assistant Dormitory
Counselors, all members of the Se-
lection Committee.

and solving the world problems.”
What a strange list. Religion, per-
haps. Sex, no. Solving world prob-
lems, I don’t know. But sex—he
most likely got tired of this subject
long ago. And the “one night a week
he allots to such frivolity.”—Well, if
he does allot one night a week to
worry about this, then you are cor-
rect and he is a pseudo; but maybe
you just happen to see him one
night a week... maybe Saturday
at the College Inn where he is back
in a corner, and you with all the
coolness of your generation perhaps
declare, “Is this a fish I see before
me?”

But on the other hand, maybe a
few of these persons are, to use the
quaint old expression, “for real.”
Maybe he is concerned with the
things he talks about on Saturday
night and perhaps he meditates over
what you refer to as “God and Sex,
ete.” all during the week up in that
no-cool-man’s-land—Baker Dorm.
And who are you to judge “our
pious little pseudo intellect?” Do
you know him? Have you ever talk-
ed with him...by yourself... for
long? And where does this all-see-
ing, perceptive sentitivity abound
that allows you to refer to “his mis-
taken sense of values?” Maybe he
is a person who has a sense of values
and actually tries to live by them.

This would be a rare bird indeed.
Sure, most of the time it is a role,
but what isn’t? Weren’t the guys

fighting the fire department playing
the rather hackneyed, cool-stud
role? Aren’t weejuns and Gant shirts
and rep ties and Brooks Brothers
and wide belts and Sem on Friday
and Hollins on Saturday as big a
role? Not pseudo intellect, but pseu-
do sophisticate.

You neat guys are very dominant

around here. So don’t wolry ...re-
lax...you’re safe. But, big fella,
why don’t you play your part and

let everybody else play his?

Six returning lettermen will be
on hand Tuesday when Washington

opens its 1963 season in Lexington
against powerful Colgate University.

Colgate ripped the General net-
ters, 9-0, on a Southern swing two
years ago, but this year should be
a different story. W&L captain John
Baker, Jim Mell, Jim DeYoung, John
Mills and Lindsey Short make up
a formidable group for the invad-

a junior from Suffolk, is rated as one
of Coach Bill Washburn’s top play-

Colgate and W&L did not meet in

The Generals, who posted a 5-3

be George Washington University
and the University of Virginia.

Baseball
Faces Elon

'In Opener

By TOM CARPENTER

Lane, Flanagan, and a little luck
appear to be the keys to a success-
ful season for the baseball team as
they prepare for their season open-
er March 30 at Elon.

The Generals opened their exhi-
bition season here Saturday with a
6-5 defeat at the hands of a rugged
VMI squad. It was a tough defeat

:|as W&L overcame a 4-0 deficit to

tie the game, only to lose it on a

| passed ball and a wild pitch.

Lane, Flanagan Star
The stars of the game were Cap-
tain Chuck Lane and second base-
man Lou Flanagan. Lane played

‘| flawless ball in the field and rapped

two clean singles, but was over-

:| shadowed by the heavy hitting and
‘| heady play of Flanagan.

The hustling junior
and a

pounded a
clutch double

tastic in the field.
For example, on a single to left

Flanagan took the relay throw from

Dick Brown, noticed that the runner

/ had taken too wide a turn, and
:, whipped the ball to Howie Martin
:| for the out.

Flanagan also was the main man

on a play in which the Generals

foiled a double steal, getting the
runner on third and keeping the

| runner on first from advancing.

Allen Sharp
Ashley Allen also looked good in
the game, banging a clutch single to
drive in an important run and play-
ing steadily behind the plate.

The Elon College game is the first
stop on the spring trip that in-
cludes Camp Lejeune, East Carolina
College, and Old Dominion. The
squad should be at full strength
with the exception of centerfielder

Old Dominion To Be Big

Test

For Generals’ Track Supremacy

Washington and Lee University’s:
track team—67 men strong for 1963—
is shooting for its third undefeated
season in four years.

Only a 69-62 loss to Wake Forest
College last spring kept the Gen-
erals from scoring a perfect 21-0
dual meet record for 1960, 1961 and
1962.

The biggest obstacle to the Gen-
erals’ bid for another unblemished
record is today’s opponent—Old Do-
minion in Norfolk.

Twenty-five veterans and a host of
freshmen are combining to form
what Coach Norm Lord calls a “team
of real promise.”

Headed by co-captains Dave Mun-
roe in the shot put and Mickey
Walker in the javelin, the Generals
boast the most powerful of all
track weapons—depth—in the 13 of
the 15 events. Only the pole vault
and high jump lack at least three
“good” men.

Junior Robin Kell stands alone
as the best in the high jump and
hop, step and jump. Kell finished
second in both events in last year’s
state meet.

Kell’s brother, Chris, is the Gen-
erals’ top dash man, but he is cur-

 

rently sidelined with a leg injury.
Freshmen Don Casto, Scott Ken-
nedy and Mark Owen and junior
Henry Sackett should take up the
slack created by Kell’s injury.

In the distances, the freshmen ac-
count for some welcomed depth
over last year. Riff O’Connor (two-
mile), Lee Johnson (mile) and Clyde
Foshee (mile) join veterans Mike
Shank, Andy Kilpatrick, Charlie
Head and Bob Patton.

Skip Essex, who finished second
to Virginia’s 440 whiz Gil Faccio
in the state meet last year, is still
the champ of the middle distance
men. Mack Brownlee and Fox
Urquhart along with freshmen Jim
Thompson and senior Wayne Barnes
back up Essex.

The Broad jump is a coach’s para-
dise. Tommy Edwards, Sackett and
Robin Kell are well over 21 feet,
and four others are pushing the 20-
foot barrier.

In the hurdles, junior John Pear-
son is the number one man, but
freshmen Bob Vaughan, Mike Goode,
George Bokinsky, Ken McGraw and
Casto should add much-needed
depth.

HOW TO GET EDUCATED
ALTHOUGH ATTENDING COLLEGE

In your quest for a college degree, are you becoming a narrow
specialist, or are you being educated in the broad, classical
sense of the word?

This question is being asked today by many serious observers
—ineluding my barber, my roofer, and my little dog Spot—
and it would be well to seek an answer.

Are we becoming experts only in the confined area of our
majors, or does our knowledge range far and wide? Do we, for
example, know who fought in the Battle of Jenkins’ Kar, or
Kant’s epistemology, or Planck’s constant, or Valsalva’s maneu-
ver, or what Wordsworth was doing ten miles above Tintern
Abbey?

If we do not, we are turning, alas, into specialists. How
then can we broaden our vistas, lengthen our horizons—be-
come, in short, educated?

Well sir, the first thing we must do is throw away our curri-
cula. Tomorrow, instead of going to the same old classes, let
us try something new. Let us not think of college as a rigid
discipline, but as a kind of vast academic smorgasbord, with
all kinds of tempting intellectual tidbits to savor. Let’s start
sampling tomorrow.

artifacts. Then we will go over to marine biology and spend a
happy hour with the sea slugs. Then we will open our pores by
drilling a spell with the ROTC. Then we'll go over to journalism
and tear out the front page. Then we'll go to the medical school
and autograph some casts. Then we'll go to home economics
and have lunch.

And between classes we'll smoke Marlboro Cigarettes. This,
let me emphasize, is not an added fillip to the broadening of
our education. This is an essential. To learn to live fully and
well is an important part of education, and Marlboros are an
important part of living fully and well. What a sense of com-
pleteness you will get from Marlboro’s fine tobaccos, from
Marlboro’s pure filter! What flavor Marlboro delivers! Through
that immaculate filter comes flavor in full measure, flavor with-
out stint or compromise, flavor that wrinkled care derides,
flavor holding both its sides. This triumph of the tobacconist’s
art comes to you in soft pack or Flip-Top box and can be lighted
with match, lighter, candle, Welsbach mantle, or by rubbing
two small Indians together.

When we have embarked on this new regimen—or, more
accurately, lack of regimen—we will soon be cultured as all
get out. When strangers accost us on the street and say, ‘‘What
was Wordsworth doing ten miles above Tintern Abbey, hey?”
we will no longer slink away in silent abashment. We will reply
loud and clear:

“As any truly educated person knows, Wordsworth, Shelley,
and Keats used to go to the Widdicombe Fair every year for
the poetry-writing contests and three-legged races, both of
which they enjoyed lyrically. Well sir, imagine their chagrin
when they arrived at the Fair in 1776 and learned that Oliver
Cromwell, uneasy because Guy Fawkes had just invented the
spinning jenny, had cancelled all public gatherings, including
the Widdicombe Fair and Liverpool. Shelley was so upset
that he drowned himself in a butt of malmsey. Keats went to
London and beeame Charlotte Bronte. Wordsworth ran blindly
into the forest until he collapsed in a heap ten miles above
Tintern Abbey. There he lay for several years, sobbing and
kicking his little fat legs. At length, peace returned to him. He
looked around, noted the beauty of the forest, and was so moved
that. he wrote Joyce Kilmer’s immortal Trees... And that,
smart-apple, is what Wordsworth was doing ten miles above
Tintern Abbey.”

Pace Selects Ten Best Movies

(Continued from page 2)
rector alive. His film proceeds at an
incredable rate. His film technique
is superb. The only faults I found
in this movie were the irrelevancy
of some scenes, and its inconsistency.
Truffaut allows us to look forward
to much better films.

4. Last Year at Marienbad—(Alain
Resnais)—Very simply, it was the
most visually fascinating film of
this year, or any other. Its incon-
gruity makes you believe that Res-
nais has merely touched on a new
and brilliant concept.

5. Shoot the Piano Player—(Fran-
cois Truffaut)—This was Truffaut's
second film. It, as does Jules and
Jim. shows his genius in the craft
of film making, although it falls short
of being a great movie. Truffaut's use
of music added immeasurably to
the films effect.

6. Lawrence of Arabia (David
Lean)—When you see it, you will
have to admit that at last here is a
spectacular that is spectacular in
every scene. I found it always inter-
esting, and Peter O’Toole’s perform-
ances will add to Lawrence’s legend.

7. The Miracle Worker (Arthur
Penn)—Despite its being too melo-
dramatic, and several poor support-
ing performances, this film packed
the most impressive impact of the
year. Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke
gave two brilliant performances.

8.Long Day's Journey Into Night
(Sidney Lumet)—It began strong,
became a little dull, only to come
on brilliantly the last 45 minutes.
Though it was perhaps too long,
paradoxically its length added to its
strength. There were three very fine
performances, and Lumet’s direction
was well-controlled.

9. David and Lisa (Frank Perry)— |
This was almost an amateur pro-|
duction; it was a first effort film.
Its real rank comes from what Per- |
ry promises to give in the future.

10. Lonely Are the Brave (David)
Miller) and Taste of Honey (Tony '

| Richardson)—Both films were very
good and offered up something that
was interesting. Neither one had
pretense, and both contained some
excellent performances.

There were, of course, other films
which were noteworthy. There were
some that I was sorry to leave off.
Here are a few:

Through a Glass Darkly (Igmar
Bergman), To Kill a Mockingbird
(Robert Mulligan), Billy Budd
(Peter Ustinov), Two for the See-
saw (Robert Wise), Birdman of Al-
catraz (John Frankenheimer, Di-
vorce—lItalian Style (Pietro Germi),
View from the Bridge (Sidney
Lumet), The Notorious Landlady
(Robert Mulligan).

And I am sure there are others. I
forget easily. However, I do remem-
ber The Manchurian Candidate. It
is purposely omitted.

Letters To The Editor

Dear Sir:

During the past several weeks,
many comments on the inefficiency
of the Slater System have appeared
in the pages of the Ring-tum Phi.
However, I feel that there exists
a situation of much graver concern
to all students.

Lying some thirty feet from the
much-discussed Evans Dining Hall
is the University Co-op and “book-
store,” a mercenary institution which
is choking the student. As I see the
manager of this institution drive
home in his brand new Oldsmobile
after a hard six-hour working day,
I feel assured that his is a success-
ful establishment.

The success of the bookstore is
dependent on the law of supply and
demand. Unfortunately, while we,
the students, have the demand, the
bookstore does not have the supply.
Those items which the store does
have are grossly overpriced. Allow

me to cite a few illustrative ex-
amples.
1) Several weeks ago, I purchased

a book which is required reading for
my History course. This book, a
paperback, was originally priced
exorbitantly at $1.25. However,
cleverly pasted over the original
price was another label, making an
even further markup.

2) Because of the great demand
for major novels, the shelves in the
library are kept consistently void
of these works. The student now
must turn to the bookstore, where
he hopes to purchase inexpensively
the book he is seeking. However, he
finds to his dismay that the “bhook-
store” does not have the book unless
=

required reading for some
course.
Books, especially those required

for courses, are obviously a necessity
for the student. It is a financial
strain on many students who are
forced to pay high prices for such
necessities. Some sensible reform,
therefore, is in order.

I propose that the bookstore and
Co-op be modified to correspond
along the lines of similar set-ups
at schools such as Harvard and Yale,

 

or at Southern institutions such as
Emory University. For example, at
the Harvard “Coop,” the Harvard
students are issued a card which
enables them to purchase at a re-
duced rate anything from books to
banners to chairs.

Our own system should be modi-
fied similarly, in order to offer to
th student of Washington and Lee
both a wide variety of selections
and sensible prices, as neither of
these is available to him at the
present.

The mound duo of Mason McGow-

have the pitches, but neither has

staff consists of sidearmer Lou Pa-

this season.

or Spring Trip
between Allen and freshman Pete
Hendricks. Hendricks has done well
thus far, but hurt his chances by
missing the VMI game with an
injured left hand. Allen was quite
impressive with his bat against the
Keydets.
Infield Set

The infield will probably be Mrr-
tin at first, Buck Rose at short, and
Lane and Flanagan. Barry Green
and Eric Sisler, a freshman, are also
in the running. There is a possibility
that Sisler will be at second when
the season starts, with Flanagan
moving to first.

The outfield is fairly solvent with
Brown in left, Candler in center, and
Bob Taylor in right. Ricky Kneipper
and Jim Boardman are the main re-
serves. Boardman will probably
handle center in Candler’s absence
on the trip, since Kneipper is out
with poison ivy.

The game with Old Dominion
should be the highlight of the trip.
The Norfolk club has won 13
straight and is still going strong.
A victory over the Monarchs would
make it a successful trip.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Despite the vote margin carried by the new Progressive
Party into this year’s campus elections, the political situation
should not be regarded as open and shut. There is enough
emphasis on individual qualifications, rather than on straight
party affiliation to bring an atmosphere of contest into each
of the Big Three races.

Because individual qualifications are so important, the Fri-
day edition of the Ring-tum Phi feels justified in presenting the
qualifications of each of the candidates for student body office.
On the basis of this evidence, we are picking the man for
each of these posts whom we feel to be the most qualified and
who would serve the student body best.

We feel that a student newspaper should be a commentator
on the facts as well as a reporter of them. At times, such com-
ment arouses little interest among the readers; at other times,
there may be readers who object to the newspaper’s judgment.
But at such times—a campus election, for example—a news-
paper should be most vocal. On these important issues, a
newspaper should not worship impartiality to the point of
ineffectuality.

FOR PRESIDENT

The race for president will be between Buck Ogilvie and
Bill Noell. Both of these men are well known to the student
body. Ogilvie, a junior from Shreveport, La., is a member
of Beta Theta Pi. Noell, a junior from Bluefield, W. Va., be-
came a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon this year.

Gradewise, both men have been consistently on the Dean’s
List and the Honor Roll. In addition both men were initiated
into Phi Eta Sigma. Noell was also recently elected to Phi Beta
Kappa. In activities, again we might rate them nearly equal.
Ogilvie is a member of SWMSFC, ODK, is a letterman as
well as co-captain of the football team, and is a dormitory
counselor. Noell is in SWMSFC, ODK, is chairman of the
Assimilation Committee, and is a member of the debate team
as well as being a finalist in the National Debate tournament
and a member of the Dance Board.

In the field of student government, Ogilvie has served for
two years on the Executive Committee representing his class
during his sophomore and junior years. On the other hand,
Noell has had no EC experience but was elected president of
the junior class.

It appears that both candidates are very similar in qualifi-
cations except in one important area and that is the most im-
portant—the Executive Committee. Because of this and his
generally more rounded career, Ogilvie appears to be the best
choice for the job.

FOR VICE PRESIDENT

The vice-presidential race this year is a very interesting
one, if for no other reason than it involves two men who are
transfers from other schools.

Tom Supak, a junior came to Washington and Lee with his
twin Jon, after spending his freshman year at William and
Mary. Supak immediately distinguished himself both on and
off the basketball court by his excellent work as guard on the
Five-Star Generals and receiving an All-CAC basketball team
award. He has consistently been on Dean’s List Honor Roll
and was President of this year’s Opening Dances.

Jim Kulp, a freshman law student who came from
Hampden-Sydney with a distinguished record, is the Univer-
sity Party’s choice for Vice-President of the Student Body.
While he was at our neighbor to the South, he became a mem-
ber of Omicron Delta Kappa, served on the Honor Council
and was both Secretary-Treasurer and Vice-President of the
Hampden--Sydney student body.

In looking at both of these candidates, we see that Kulp’s
experience in student government far outweighs that of Supak,
but that this experience was gained at a school other than
Washington and Lee. Kulp’s short stay on this campus (only
7 months) could serve as a disadvantage in dealing with cur-
rent student government problems. On the other hand Tom
Supak has been at Washington and Lee for almost three years,
and has worked with the SWMSFC and the Dance Board,
as President of Openings Dances. Thus he has worked within
the framework of the student government and this would seem
to serve as better qualification. And then there is the matter
that a member of the law school, which is, despite the constant

gilvie, Supak, Wright Selected As Most Qualified

protests, really separate from the rest of the student body,
has much less interest in undergraduate matters. Taking
this all into account it seems to us that Supak by virture of
his experience and tenure at Washington and Lee would
bring greater vitality and interest into the office of the vice-
president.

FOR SECRETARY

The evaluation of the candidates for the office of Secretary
of the Student Body is a more difficult task than either of the
two above-mentioned races for the simple reason that neither
of the candidates has any real qualifications. This is not to say
that both men have not been active in student affairs for both
Croft and Wright have a long list under their names. But we
would like to think that one of the qualifications for student
government is familiarity with the workings of the system.
With this in mind let us look at both candidates.

Ed Croft, a junior, is president-elect of the Dance Board
is a member of ODK, is President of this year’s Spring Dances
and was the Executive Committeeman in his freshman year.
This office, we may add was won under the old political system
which was broken up this year with the formation of the
Progressive Party.

Frank Wright, also a junior, is an Honor Roll student,
sophomore and junior class vice-presidents, a Dormitory coun-
selor, and a member of Phi Eta Sigma.

These qualifications form a long list on the poster and may
be some indication of the candidates ability; but what is more
important is their ability to fill the post conscientiously and
responsibly. Croft’s experience as Freshman EC, it is true, has
given him some familiarity with the workings of the Executive
Committee; but the Freshman EC post has been in the
past—and continues to be—decided on the strength of the
party and not the candidates particular qualifications. Wright’s
student government activity has been confined to the class
offices which he has held but his scholastic achievements indi-
cate his interest and diligence in school affairs. In addition it
appears that Wright would have a great deal more time to
spend on the Secretary’s duties and would not be trying to
do two time-consuming and important jobs at the same time.
It is for these reasons that the Friday Edition supports Frank
Wright for the Secretary’s position.

ByROBERT HOLLAND

I found a_ beer-drinking senior
companion huddled in the dark re-
cesses of one of Lexington’s fine
establishments the other day. He ap-
peared to be unusually pensive and
was downing brews at a phenomenal
rate.

Cautiously, but with much sympa-
thy for my erring brother, I edged
into the beer-soaked booth and pre-
pared to commiserate with the prop-
er post-mortems. Trouble over the
hill or on the Hill, I thought to
myself.

His first words stunned me and
made my conservative Washington
and Lee collar stand on end.

“W&L Dull”

“Washington and Lee is a damn
dull place to be. Nobody cares noth-
ing about nothing. No picketing. No
controversy. Staid, dull, conserva-
tive, apathetic, stifling, spritless.

“What we need is some real agi-
tation. We should fight for some
causes. Boycott, picket, demonstrate,
crusade . . . Lord knows there’s
enough wrong around here if people
would just open their eyes.”

I pretended to ignore his outburst,
ordered a tall one, shoved some
change in the juke box and re-
marked that we are indeed having
fine weather these days.

But he continued...

“For instance, remember _ that
Martin Luther King issue last year?
Sure, there were a few mild protests
at the time, but the whole matter
has died down. Why, student dele-
gations should have marched in the
streets, burned down Lee Chapel,
hanged the trustees in effigy...”

I spilled part of my brew on my
conservative Washington and Lee
shirt. My friend must be squelched.
He had passed the realm of sweet
reason,

“Now look man, don’t you know
that King is a ...And besides that
he’s a downright radical. Would you
want a left-wing slob like that to
poison the impressionable minds of
naive underclassmen?”

A Place of Free Exchange

He could reply only that a uni-
versity is supposed to be a place for
full and free exchange of ideas—no
matter how unorthodox the point
of view—and that Washington and
Lee should win a prize for orthodoxy
and conformity. The action of the
trustees, said my troubled friend
negated the entire concept of a uni-
versity and gave W&L a black eye
for all to see.

I tried to trap him by recalling
recent events in Wahoo-land:
UVa. Right?
“You mean UVa. was right in per-
mitting Gus Hall and Lincoln Rock-
well speaking platforms at Mr. Jef-

ferson’s university?” I asked. “Are.
you saying that both the American.

Legion and Governor Harrison are
wrong in protesting the appearance
of such loathesome individuals?”

No Thought Control

“Absolutely. Our society is a free
society. A university, of all our in-
stitutions, should be completely clear
of suppression and censorship. A
university should not engage in the
business of thought control.”

Blood Boils

With that, my conservative Wash-_
ington and Lee blood began to boil.

Beads of sweat began to stand out
under my conservative Washington

and Lee collar. I ordered a round.

of tall ones.

“Well, so what else is new?” I)

Finally asked in an attempt at cheer
and serenity.

My friend was not to be detoured
down the avenue of pleasantries and
idle talk, however. He went on, dis-
playing all the venom of a thorough-
ly disillusioned senior.

A Free University

“So, you don’t think a university
should be free,” he shouted.

“Free?”

“Free.”

“What do you mean free,” I asked
nervously. More sweat trickled down
the conservative collar.

Freedom Absolute

“Freedom is absolute. Freedom is
not to be adjudicated by the arbi-
trary censor. Freedom is American.
Freedom is full and frank discus-
sion of ideas. Freedom is something
Washington and Lee cannot have a
complete share in as long as un-
popular views are denied outlets of
expression.”

Ideas Too Much

The combination of strange ideas,
too much cigarette smoke and too
many tall ones created a dizzy feel-
ing in my conservative head. I ex-
cused myself by telling my friend
I would think about his theories and
discuss them later.

Back to my room... finish “keep
busy” classwork...serenity, tran-
quillity ...“don’t rock the boat”
type music... the perfect place for a
W&L gentleman, far away from
thoughts of academic freedom.

some member of your family will be
involved in a traffic mishap before
your driving days are over!

Does the figure seem too high?
Then consider this fact: the vast
majority of this nation’s annual
10,000,000 traffic accidents involve
people with good driving records.

According to studies made by the
Market Forge Company, makers of
“Mark Fore” adult child auto safety
belts, only two out of ten accidents
involve habitually reckless or irres-
ponsible drivers. Eighty per cent—
or 8,000,000 accidents yearly!—in-
volve the usually proficient, normally
conscientious, comparatively acci-
dent-free group known as “good”
drivers.

What are you doing to protect
yourself and your passengers from
accidents? As a start, here are
fifteen ways to make yourself safer
on the road:

 

| of you, but the car in front of that

one. Veteran truckers make a prac-
| tice of “driving 1,000 feet ahead” —
| that is, observing everything that’s
| going on 1,000 feet in front of them
' in order to spot irregularities in traf-
fic patterns.

2. Train yourself to watch the
left front wheels of oncoming cars.
That way you can anticipate sur-
prise turns before the other guy
swerves into your lane.

3. Always look for an “out’—a
place to run if a sudden swerve is
necessary.

4. Have your eyes checked at
least once every two years; once
a year if you’re over 40. Eyesight
changes with the years, and the
vision you had when you got your
license may not be the vision you
have now!

6

5. Remember that legal speed is
set for ideal road conditions. When
traffic is heavy or weather conditions
poor, lower your speed. Driving too
fast for conditions is the single most
important cause of accidents.

 

6. Be particularly careful about

1.Watch not only the car in front |

pect to see. And the faster you
drive at night, the less far ahead
you can see.

7. Keep your distance—and then
some!—from the car in front. The
old rule followed by many motor-
ists—one car length for every 10
miles of speed—is all right on city
streets and ordinary roads, but
stretch it on modern high speed
highways, were rear end collisions
are a common hazard. On slippery
pavements, stretch it even more.

8. Install seat belts if you don’t
already have them. They are in-
creasingly easy to get and _ install.
Look for a bet that meets
the minimum safety specifications
set forth by Washington’s tough-
minded General Services Adminis-
tration (GSA) and the car industry’s
Society of Automotive Engineers
(SAE).

Both advocate minimum weight
stress of 6,000 lbs. for adults, and
SAE recommends 3,000 lbs. for chil-
dren. These figures are based on
what the wearer would “weigh”
at the moment of collision. Futher-
more, a lightweight (no more than
five ounces) alumnium buckle as-
sures greater comfort. But the great-
est comfort is peace of mind. Cor-
nell University researchers found,
in a study of accident reports, that
only 20.9 per cent of passengers
wearing seat belts were injured, as
against 75.5 per cent of those with-
out seat belts!

9. Accept “two for the road” in
the form of seat belts only; a re-

an auto accident as the motorist
who hadn't touched a drop. In a
recent year, 21 out of every 100
drivers involved in fatal acci-
dent had been drinking—but only
seven of those 21 were intoxicated!

10. Keep your car in good shape.
Have it inspected by a competent
mechanic every six months. Keep
the inside of your car neat; things
piled on a rear window ledge block
your view, and they can become
flying missiles in case of a quick
stop.

11. Always give the right of way—
especially if the other driver is
wrong. He’s someone to watch out
for! Never pass on hills and curves
and avoid those who do.

12. On turnpike trips, keep a con-
stant watch on the speedometer;
after long hours of steady driving on
a turnpike, drivers do have the il-
lusion that the car is going slower
than it really is.

13. Drive as carefully on short
trips as on long ones—and fasten
your seat belt even if you're
only going around the corner.
Statistics show that two-thirds of
all fatal accidents occur within 25
miles of the victim’s home.

14. Avoid sudden stops. This is
your foremost protection against
being struck from behind. Get into
the proper lane for a turn as far
ahead of time as possible, so that the
driver behind isn’t invited to pass
you at the intersection.

15. Learn to spot the tip-off that
warns you where a potential accident
situation is brewing. A_ string of
cars coming toward you, headed by
a slowpoke, should telegraph the
possibility that one of them may
pull out sharply to pass. Give this
parade a wide berth. Watch parked
ears; if you see a driver at the
wheel, left front wheel turned out,
or a spurt of exhaust gas, the car
bay be getting ready to pull in front
of you. Move your foot from acceler-
ator to brake.

W&L Teams End Spring Drills

Lacrosse Wins One
As Towson Beaten;
New Hampshire Next

The varsity lacrosse team found
it rough going in the Baltimore area
last week but still managed an en-
couraging win over Towson State to
bring home the season's first league
victory.

Every year the Generals travel
to the Baltimore-Washington area
during the vacation to test their
early strength and shake out any
problems that may hamper play
during the regular season.

The afternoon of March 30 saw
some of these problems appear
W&L was forced to take a stinging
defeat from an experienced Hofstra
squad 10-1.

Slow to start, the Generals were
hit with three goals in the first
half but hung on strongly as Doug
Morrison scored W&L’s first goal
of the season. While both teams
controlled the ball equally in the
first half Hofstra took over in

as

the second, scoring seven to the *

Generals’ none. Hofstra’s greater
depth and swiftness appeared to
he the deciding factor as the Gen-
erals’ midfield tired and the at-
tack found the goal-mouth dis-
turbingly small.

But after several days practice
W&L came to life against Towson,
scoring twice early in the game.
But at the half it appeared that the
Generals would again bog down as
the score stood deadlocked at 3-3.
Team effort proved the day-saver
as the third quarter saw a show of
defense that gave Towson only one
goal and ended in five W&L scores.
The final frame appeared to be ripe
for a Towson come-back but the
Generals froze the three goal out-
burst one short of an upset.

UConn Beats
Generals 16-6

Washington and Lee's
laden baseball team opend its home
season disastrously Wednesday, bow-
ing to the University of Connec-
ticut, 16-6.

The Generals were behind from
Brice Gamber’s second pitch in the
first inning. UConn third baseman
and leadoff hitter Rick Meisner
drove that one between the outfield-
ers in left-center for a home run.
Number two batter Dorrie Jack-
son singled, and rightfielder Doug
King homered deep to right for
three runs with no outs.
Connecticut scored once more in
the first. Second baseman Doug
Gaffney singled and scored on a
double by center fielder Tony Ma-

 

galetta. Magaletta homered in the
sixth with Gaffney aboard to run
the UConn four bagger total to

three for the day.

Generals Come Back

The Generals got three runs back
in their half of the first. Leadoff
man Eric Sisler singled, Lou Paterno
walked, Ashley Allen was hit by a
pitch, and Lou Flanagan walked to
plate one run. Chuck Lane’s single
scored Paterno and Ashley Allen.

W&L tied the game in the fourth
when Sisler reached first on an error
with two out. Paterno flied to center
field, and Sisler scored when Maga-
letta dropped the ball.

UConn Explodes

Connecticut broke the game open
by scoring eight runs in the fifth,
sixth and seventh innings. In the
fifth, Magaletta reached first on an
outfield error, shortstop Lee Johnson
singled, Meisner walked, and Jack-
son singled to score three runs.
| Magaletta’s homer accounted for
‘two runs in the sixth. Meisner
opened the seventh with a single,
and Jackson doubled him home.
King reached base on an error, scor-
ing behind Jackson when catcher
Mike Haiday singled.

The UConns added one run in
the eighth on Johnson's triple and
a single by pitcher Russ Rotko. In|
the ninth, King doubled, Haiday |
singled him home, Gaffney hit a
long fly which General left fielder
dropped after a hard run, and
Magaletta doubled.

The Generals lost this one on the
mound. Gamber left after six innings
with a blister on his throwing hand,
and Lou Paterno moved over from
first to do the pitching. He got
one man out, then pulled a_ neck
muscle delivering a pitch. Coach Joe
Lyles, his pitching staff totally de-
molished due to injuries, put re-
serve outfielder Dick Brown in to
throw. Brown, with no previous
experience on the mound, did his
best, but it wasn’t enough.

Allen Hurt

Starting catcher Ashley Allen was
hurt again in Wednesday’s game.
Allen twice was hit with a pitch, the
second time on his left hand. Already
crippled by a dislocated finger on the
hand, necessitating his using a

5-4 By Tigers

The Washington and Lee Tennis
team dropped its first match of the
season in a close 5-4 duel with
Hampden-Sydney, here yesterday.

Victory hinged on the first doubles
match between Captain Baker and
DeYoung of W&L and Hatcher and
Heieleg of Hampden-Sydney. The
Tigers defeated the Generals in a
hard fought match ending in a
score of 10-8, 7-5.

Coach Bill Washburn picked out
Jim DeYoung, sophomore, and
freshman Forrest Dickinson as
promising prospects for the 1963 sea-
son. Dickinson played extremely
well despite the fact that he and
Jim Mell lost their doubles match.

The Tigers brought a 2-0 record
to Lexington after defeating the Uni-
versity of Richmond and the Medi-
cal College of Virginia. This was the
Generals’ first match of the season—
the Colgate match scheduled for
March 26 was rained out.

Singles winners: Hatcher (HS) 7-

| leg (HS) ¢

Study Plan

Announced

Princeton University has estab-
lished a Cooperative Undergraduate
Program for Critical Languages. The
new program, supported by a grant
from Carnegie Corporation of New
York, will make available to under-
graduates of certain other institu-
tions, including Washington and Lee,
Prineeton’s resources for instruc-
tion in Arabic, Chinese, Japanese,
Persian, Russian and Turkish lan-
guages and related regional studies
in the social sciences.

Admission to Princeton

In the program, undergraduates
from certain other institutions will
be admitted to Princeton at the end
of their sophomore year for a year
of instruction in the critical lan-
guages and related regional studies
and will return to their own college
as seniors to complete their under-
graduate education.

There are two requirements for |
admission to the Program: a distin-
euished college academic record and
one year of the critical language to
be studied. The second requirement |
may be met by an intensive summer
course. A number of summer schol- !
arships available. While at
Princeton, undergraduates taking |
part in the program are eligible for |
financial aid, on the basis of need. |

‘ |
Many Colleges Included

 

are

Dean Pusey stated that our facul-
ty had approved the cooperation of
Washington and Lee in this new pro-
gram. Participating colleges also}
include Carelton, Hamilton, Haver-
ford, Kenyon, Lawrence, Oberlin,
and Swarthmore Colleges. Wash-
ington and Lee is the only institu-
tion from the South so far invited
to take part in the plan.

Most liberal arts colleges not as-
sociated with major graduate schools
unable to offer instruction in
most of these languages. The Prince- |
ton Program will provide a wholly
new opportunity for such  partici- |
pation.

Any interested and qualified stu-
dents should consult Dean Pusey at
once. May 1 is the deadline for ap-
plication to Princeton.

By ROGER PAINE
Managing Editor
About 75 students listened last
night in duPont Auditorium to six
brief speeches made by the candi-
dates for Executive posts. The
speeches themselves lasted for one-
half an hour, and for the following
hour a question and answer session

was held.
3ill Noell, presidential candidate

from the Progressive Party, led off
the speeches by addressing himself

to his opponent’s two year’s exper-
ience on the EC. “Experience

The invitational tournament was
attended by a total of twelve teams,
each of which presented alternately
the aflirmative and negative sides
of the national college debate topic,

Eckes and Fitzgerald met the strong,
undefeated University of Virginia
team and disposed of them in a very

Supak Emphasizes Forum
Tom Supak, running on the Pro- |
gressive ticket against Kulp, began |
his speech by asking whether a 28-)
year-old law student such as his}
opponent could share the same fei |
ings and have the same knowledge
of W&L that the normal under-
graduate has. Supak charged that
Kulp with a lack of contact with}
faculty and students, then pointed |
to the Faculty-Student Forum |

which is part of the Progressive
platform. He emphasized this above |
the other points in their platform. |

Frank Wright, Progressive candi- |
date for secretary, stated that the |
secretary's office is one demanding
a person who is willing not only to

a person who has a keen sense of
judgment, and to obtain
the truth in every case which comes
before him. He mentioned experi-
ence, as did Noell, and followed up
by saying that “experience is based
upon the ability of the individual
to perceive, to understand, and to
remember.” Thus, he concluded, the
ability inherent in the individual,
not the experience itself, is what is
important.

During the question and
period, discussion centered upon
minute aspects concerning the honor

dent on campus and urging him to
vote.”

Last night’s announcement was the
culmination of organizational work
which was begun in late February,
after the breakup of the old parties
and the formation of the Progressive
Party. Non-fraternity students, in
recognizing that the new political
balance on campus would give them
powerful voice elections

a in an-
nounced the testablishment of the
Independent Union just before

Spring Vacation.

A steering committee has guided
the growth of the Union and rep-
resented non-fraternity students in
political party Clique meetings.
Members of this committee are Bill
Lowry, Matt Hulbert, Rod Cock-
shutt, Andy Stone, Shannon Jung,
Gene Hatfield, Lew Davis and Neil
Houghton.

Independent leaders have stated
that their Union is not merely po-
litical, and that it will also offer
social and athletic opportunities for
non-fraternity students. But their
main purpose is to obtain political
participation for Independent stu-
dents, a goal which was apparently
out of reach under the old political
system dominated by the University
Party.

Cockshutt has stated that “The
primary function of the Union is to

One Man’s Opinion
When election time at W&L rears its head. the air is filled
with exhortations of one candidate’s experience, another's
ability and so forth on down the line. The only trouble with
such goings on is that often times the people doing the exhort-
ing have very little real connection with or knowledge of the
candidate they’re backing (except, perhaps, through campus

political ties) .

It is for this reason, along with the realization that to
endorse a slate of candidates would constitute merely one man’s
opinion, that the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi will not offer a list of
candidates as its choice for the election on Thursday. Instead
this page has been devoted to letting the opposing candidates

speak for themselves.

So here they are. Make up your own minds.

Spring ... And Elections

Spring elections are different this year. Those students who
habitually cheer for the underdog will miss the old Independent
Party, which died long ago but was only recently interred.
Those who like a perpetual winner will be concerned to behold
the University Party involved in a real campaign for the first

time, perhaps, in decades.

In the past, the spring script called for: madras jackets, ber-
muda shorts, a frantic search for candidates by the Indepen-
dent Party, a frantic campaign against the one-party system . . .
and a virtual sweep by the Big Clique Gravy Train. This year
only the costumes are the same, and it’s not without a touch
nostalgia, perhaps even a tear, that the perceptive upperclass-
man notices how holied political tradition has been rudely

disrupted.

The Big Clique has been trimmed down to nine houses,
the same size as the new Progressive Party. The non-fraternity
students have demanded a voice in the campaign—and they’ re
organized this year. Since neither party owns a definite ma-
jority, it appears that the campaign may be decided on issues,
which might, of course, force an uncomfortable situation on
some of the old party leaders. On the other hand, it might pro-
voke some intelligent interest among the voters, which could

be the biggest change of all.

Progressive Party Candidate
Running for Secretary

Juniors Croft And Wright
Vie for Secretarial Post

In my estimation the office of
Seeretary of the Student Body is one
which requires much responsibility
from the person who holds it. In
the administration of the Honor
System, the secretary, like all other
members of the Executive Commit-
tee, bears the dual responsiblity of
protecting the individual involved
as well as seeing that the spirit of
honor on the Washington and Lee
campus is maintained. For this rea-
son he must approach each honor
trial with a keen sense of judgment
and a desire of obtaining the truth.
With respect to the administrative
duties of the secretary, he must be
willing to devote his time and his
efforts to insure that all matters of
a clerical nature are conducted
promptly and thoroughly. The sec-
retary must also assist the presi-
dent in any way he can, and as a
chosen representative of the student
bedy, he has the particular respon-
sibility of keeping that student body
informed of the general proceedings
of the Executive Committee.

This enumeration of the duties of
secretary brings an important fact
to mind. It is evident from the size
and the variety of responsibility that
the secretary must assume that ex-
perience is not the only criterion
upon which one must judge the
competency of a candidate for this
office. Such individual qualities as

Ed Croft
University Party Candidate
Running for Secretary

Gentlemen:

The University Party has honored
me with the nomination for Sec-
retary of the Student Body, a re-
sponsible position for which I am
more than willing to run. When con-
sidering the qualifications of the
candidates, there should be three
primary areas of attention: exper-
ience, ability, and the willingness to
serve the Student Body. Let me now
review my qualifications for you in
light of these considerations.

My freshman year I was elected
the class representative to the Exe-
cutive Committee. Being on the
Committee has given me valuable
experience and a familiarity with
the workings of the system of gov-
ernment, this being a most important
asset which my opponent does not
have.

The ability of the candidate is the
second important area of considera-
tion, My ability has been proven in
all phases of school life, In sports,
I have received varsity letters in
both football and track, I have con-
sistently mainiained above-average
grades and have served as President
of the sophomore class. I was a
Vice-President of last year’s highly
successful Faney Dress Ball and
in charge of the costume sale for
this year’s Civil War Centennial
Ball and Presidents of this year’s
Springs Weekend. For my ability

out first expressing my sincere grat-
itude for two things. The first is my
thanks for the honor and privilege
of serving you as Executive Commit-
teeman for two years. These two
years have taught me a great deal
about student government at Wash-
ington and Lee, and my only hope
is that I have added to that process
just a fraction of what I have learned
from it. The second thing for which
I am thankful is the confidence in
me that you have shown by nomi-
nating me for this most important
office. I accept this nomination with
humility, for I believe I know the
work involved in being President,
and it is therefore with this sense
of gratitude and humility that I
say a few words.

My three years here have brought
me into contact with every facet of
student life. Through these contacts
I have come to know the feelings
of many different students and have
learned their thoughts on student
government. Our platform reflects |
some of these thoughts, but limited |
space prevents me from elaborating |
on these here. However, throughout |
the week I shall be expressing my
views on the various issues at hand
and also the many incidental issues
of the campaign. I firmly believe!
that I know what we as students |
need and desire.

Despite the importance of the exe- |
cutive and legislative functions of |
the Executive Committee, I feel that |
its most crucial function is in its!

 

judicial capacity. This involves the

education of the student body to the
principles of the Honor System, and
its enforcement. It is with personal
knowledge of this grave responsibil-
ity that I offer myself as a candidate
before you, the Student Body of
Washington and Lee. During the
two years that I have served on
the Executive Committee, I have
seen men before that committee on
many occasions. I have been com-
pelled to make decisions about these
men, decisions made only after the
most thorough examinations of all
possible motives as well as facts,
decisions that have resulted in the
dread finality of an Honor System
violation.

(Continued on page 4)

 

 

In the Friday edition of the Ring-
tum Phi, much attention was given
to the fact that my opponent’s ex-
perience on the Executive Commit-
tee constituted proper grounds for
an editorial endorsement of his can-
didacy for President of the Student
Body. But the one question which
the editorial left unanswered in my
mind was simply this: What does
experience mean in and of itself?
Does experience necessarily reflect
judgmental ability? Does experience
necessarily indicate initiative and
perceptiveness? Does experience
necessarily connote a_ significantly
analytical mind? Does experience
necessarily suggest a more funda-
mental understanding and apprecia-
tion of the Honor System? Does ex-
perience necessarily argue logically
for the negation of another individ-
ual’s ability to recognize the spirit
embodied in Honor as a concept? Is
experience necessarily conducive to
the acceptance of new ideas or is it
the crutch on which one leans as a
justification for embracing the past?
Its experience necessarily synono-
mous with capacity for leadership? Is
experience necessarily a recommen-
dation for election, or is it more
nearly a descriptive statistic?

Is not experience more realistical-
ly an argument, which Buck hoped
would be so plausible on its surface,
that its superficiality would go un-
noticed and unquestioned? Is not

' experience the popular myth that

the Boston Transcript exploded as
“a perpetual best seller that every-
body’s continually, unthinkingly, and
unjustifiably buying’? Does not ex-
perience on this campus point more
basically to systems which promote
individual personalities and sus-
tain them in the campus limelight?

The foregoing has been aimed at
suggesting that there is nothing in-
herently magical about anyone’s ex-
perience. Individuals have served
on university committees, but they
have not necessarily been judged
qualified to assume the chairman-
ship; Vice-presidents of the United
States have campaigned unsuccess-
fully for the Presidency, because ex-
perience was weighed on the scales
and was found inadequate in itself as
a qualification for higher office; in
business, chief executives are often
brought into the firm from sources

(Continued on page 4)

 

I would like to take this opportu-
nity to express my appreciation to
the members of the University Party
for your confidence in nominating
me as your party’s candidate for the
office of Vice-President of the Stu-
dent Body. It is a privilege to have
been nominated for such a high po-
sition, and if elected I will do my
utmost to see that I am deserving
of your confidence.

Perhaps the greatest single ques-
tion which has engaged the minds
of this University’s students during
the last week is why do I believe I
should be elected to the office of
Vice-President of the Student Body.
In attempting to answer this ques-
tion I will separate the functions of
this office into two categories and
deal with each separately.

This first category is that of con-
tributing assistance in the formula-
tion of the executive and legislative
powers of the Executive Committee
in matters pertaining to the Student
Body Organization. As I have pre-
viously served in the capacity of
Vice-President of a college student
body, I feel that I have gained a
measure of experience and _ insight
into the intricacies of Student Gov-

| ernment affairs which could be used

to advantage by this student body.
This experience would enable me to
offer suggestions to the President and
other members of the Executive
Committee in the mapping of strat-
egy to be used in the presentation
of matters which vitally concern the
student body to the Administration.
One of the important duties of the
Vice-President is to work with the
other elected officials of the student
body in carrying to the Adminis-
tration the desires of the students. I
have been called upon on numerous
occasions to appear before various
faculty bodies to present Student
Government matters, and feel that
I can draw upon this background of
experience to help this Student Body
attain the goals which it sets for it-
self.

The second category is that of
aiding in the administration of this
University’s Honor System. This
function is the most important single
duty which could ever befall any
student. To sit as judge of another
is never an easy task and should
never be taken lightly. The authori-

USSR and Red China

 

Although I realize the difficulty
of a succinct statement of political
views, I am going to attempt such
a statement in the following para-
graphs.

First, by the way of refutation of
my opponent, I would like to cor-
roborate my own position. I will
attempt to do this with as much ob-
jectivity and avoidance of deroga-
tion as possible; however, I must
warn you that I feel strongly on
this particular point. I cannot honest-
ly feel that a 28 year old freshman
law student who has only been at
Washington and Lee for seven
months is in contact with the rest
of the student body. There must be
a distinct hiatus of interest and
views here, and this is a separa-
tion which the student body can
ill afford.

Admittedly, I have only attended
this University for two years; how-
ever, during those two years I have
participated in student body affairs.
Ostensibly, these two years may not
seem more valuable than the seven
months of my opponent. However,
ask yourself—as a second semester
freshman—would you feel qualified
to run for the vice-presidency of
the student body? I hope that I
have not belabored this point; how-
ever, I sincerely feel that were I
not running for this office my reac-
tion to the University Party’s candi-
date would be the same .

Second, I would like to support
myself in a more positive manner. I
feel quite sure that most students
would like to become vice-president
of this University; I wonder how
many have thought about their
reasons? At any rate, I certainly
have, and I would like to relate
those reasons to you in a general
manner, I feel that if the Pro-
gressive Party is elected something
will be done. I support the tradi-
tions of this University; I am neither
for them for their own sake nor
against them for their own sake.
However, I do feel that within the
limits of these traditions many lib-
eral changes can be wrought. Hap-
pily, the student body is extending
itself in this direction, and by work-
ing in close contact with the faculty
the student-faculty forum would be
quite efficacious in this area. I
honestly feel that much can be ac-

Ideological Conflict—Or Power Struggle?

By BILL NOELL

It cannot be questioned that there
is an immense gap between the gov-
ernments of Communism’s Big Two:
the Soviet Union and Communist
China. Whether one wishes to argue
that the grounds for such a dis-
agreement are ideological, sociolog-
ical, or just nationalistic, one must
first note the fact that this gap
is widening and is certainly getting
no better; consequently the possi-
bilities for the West to benefit from
that schism are fairly great.

Lincoln’s declaration that “A house
divided against itself cannot stand.”
was not a statement, the truth of
which is peculiar to a democratically
oriented nation. Not unaware of that
fact, Russia would be delighted to
settle her differences with China—
but only if Russia can set the terms
of the accord, and vice versa. But
Mr. Khrushchev has cast serious
doubts on the ability of unilateral
decision making in this area, when
he stated, “The matter has an in-
ertia of its own.”

Ideological Conflict

 

which has an ideological basis. Pe-| and volatile, albeit pragmatic world

king has accused Moscow of commit-
ting an almost limitless number of
Marxist Crimes such as “kowtowing”
before “American beancurd tiger,
adventurism, capitulationism, parlia-
mentary cretinism, revisionism, and
reformation.”

On the other hand, Moscow has
replied to Mao’s charges by point-
ing to the vestiges of Communist
unity, alleging that he is doing noth-
ing more than promoting an actual
break between the two nations; if
the Soviet Union has violated Marx-
ist-Leninst tenets, it has done so
only in the interests of advancing
Communist influence in the world.
Hence, the potential danger associat-
ed with China’s actions and protes-
tations are having a far worse ef-
fect on the “good of the cause” than
could any Russian departure from
principle.

Russian Position

It is then the Russian position that
the Chinese are unrealistic, and
that their dogged devotion to prin-
ciple for principle’s sake is indiea-

On the surface, both parties are| tive of a general shortsightedness on
disposed to call the conflict one! their part, in the face of an electric

|

 

political situation, which is to be re-
solved in terms of filling stomachs,
not in terms of peddling ideas.

Power Struggle

More realistically, however, the
rift goes deeper than a mere differ-
ence in the interpretation of Marxist-
Leninist ideology. It is first and fore-
most a power struggle between two
intensely nationalistic peoples. Its
immediate implications are evident
in China’s bid for leadership within
the bloc, itself. Such an occur-
rence is not at all unnatural; China
is already a powerful nation, and is
potentially a great one. She has no
intention of being drawn into a
group of Soviet satellites, as Poland,
Hungarq, and Czechoslovakia have
been, and she will continue to agi-
tate for no less than equality with
Russia, as she attempts to up-grade
her economy and to better the lot
of her people,

Alexander Dallin of Columbia
University’s Russian Institute has
stated, “We will now witness com-
petition for the loyalty and support
of the 81 world (Communist) parties.

 

There will be an equally serious

campaign in the uncommitted nations
as at the recent Afro-Asian confer-
ence in Tanganyika, where we saw
the Chinese criticizing the U.S.S.R.
almost as strongly as they were the
US.”

Ethic Disparity

There is also a racial or sociologi-
cal foundation to this widening split.
One does not have to examine Rus-
sian History in any particular depth,
or to study any extended time per-
iods, to discover the anxieties which
the Russians have traditionally ex-
hibited toward the masses from the
East. As the editor of the Russian
newspaper, Izvestia, stated in con-
versation with Western correspon-
dents, “While the nations of Western
Europe were building their cathe-
drals and cities, the Russians were
protecting them from the Chinese
hordes.”

In light of China’s recent ex-
pansionist activities in East-Asia
Tibet, India, South Viet Nam, and
persistent designs on Formosa—the
Russians have justifiable cause to
fear that militant force on their
borders—borders which the Chinese

440 relay Saturday in Colonial

Relays. The Generals finished fourth. (Photo by Darden)

Generals Grab Seventh Place
In 1st Annual Colonial Relays

Sparked by the jumping of Robin
Kell and the running of Wayne
Barnes, Mack Brownlee, Don Casto,
and John Pearson the Washington
and Lee track team rolled to a sev-
enth place finish in the Colonial Re-
lays Saturday at Williamsburg.

In unofficial team standing W&L
earned 15 points, finishing ahead of
Old Dominion College, Mt. Saint
Mary’s, the University of Virginia,
American University, North Carolina
State, and Richmond. William and
Mary walked off with the first Co-
lonial Relays title, piling up 8”%
points. VMI was second, followed
by VPI, West Virginia, Wake For-
est, and Roanoke.

Kell Second

Junior Kell was the high point
man for the Generals with eight.
He finished second to William and
Mary’s Bill Jeffries in the high
jump at 5-10. Jeffries cleared 6-2.

In the hop, step, and jump—Kell’s
best event—the 6-2 junior wound up
second also when VPI’s J. W. Carter
leaped 44-614 on his final jump to
win by a quarter of an inch,

W&L’s best running effort came in
the sprint medley where the Gen-
erals whipped William and Mary and
West Virginia in winning the heat,
but ended up third when Wake For-
est and Virginia galloped home in

Fourth place finishes in the 440
relay, the distance medley and the
4-mile relay wound up the Generals’
scoring.

Barnes and Casto with 10.7’s each
paced the 440 relay team to a 44.5

Here’s where a button-down should button down

 

 

on a wild pitch.

Washington and Lee went ahead
to stay in their half of the sixth.
Catcher Doug Davis singled with
two out. Wigert, a lefthanded batter,
stepped to the plate, and the Castle-
ton coach drew his leftfielder in.
Wigert hit Parro’s pitch where the
leftfielder had been, and was around
the bases before Castleton could get
the ball back to the infield.

Lane Homers

The last run for each team came

Wigert, who allowed 14 hits in the,
runs with a|

on home runs, one by General third
baseman Chuck Lane in the seventh,
and one by Castleton’s Notte in the
ninth.

Castleton scored seven runs on 14
hits and four W&L errors. W&L got
nine on 14 hits and four errors. Be-
sides Wigert, Lane and Rose went
two-for-three at the plate for the
Generals. Lane is now 11 for 21
against competition this season, and
leads the team in batting with a
923 average. Notte lead Castleton
with a triple and homer .

 

New Hampshire Smothers
WG&GL Lacrosse Team, 13-9

Jim West fired in five goals for
New Hampshire’s lacrosse team Fri-
day as the Wildcats notched their
fifth victory of the spring by defeat-
ing Washington and Lee, 13-8.

With West collecting two goals in
first period and his other three in
the second quarter against goalie
Butch West, New Hampshire piled
up 8-2 lead at halftime.

Generals Rally

The Wildcats made it 9-2 against
goalie Pete Noonan early in the
third period before W&L belatedly
caught fire and scored four times in
a minute and 35 seconds.

The Generals looked extra sharp
for this short period as they scored,
controlled the faceoff, and scored
again four straight times.

McDaniel Stars

Midfielder John McDaniel was the
star of the assault, collecting two
of the four goals.

One of McDaniel’s scores was a
beautiful fake shot. The little Genertl

proceeded to dump the ball into the
empty right half of the goal. His
other score came on a pass from Bob
Hanky.

New Hampshire Romps

New Hampshire, however, came
back strong after the W&L assault,
and sewed up the game with a three-
goal final period.

Sam Niblett took over where Jim
West left off in the second half,
scoring three of the Wildcats five
second half goals.

McDaniel and junior Randy Woot-
ton paced the Generals’ offense.
McDaniel had three goals and an
assist while Wootton scored two
goals.

out this motivation and _ ability
in a much less qualified position
than one who lacks that nebulous

ty of the Executive Committee in
dealing with honor violations is an
awesome power. They have within
their authority the power to dismiss
a student under other than honor-
able conditions. Such an action not
only has an immediate effect upon
a student but can and will have an
everlasting effect. It is for this rea-
son that members of the Executive
Committee must know and fully un-
derstand just what evidence is nec-
essary and sufficient to warrant the
taking of such drastic action. I be-
lieve that in this area of student
affairs experience is a must. There
is no time for experimentation for
each time the Executive Committee
meets to consider an honor violation
the fate of a student hangs in the
balance. Mistakes due to inexper-
ience should not be tolerated. As in

everyone was a possibility.

Considerable attention was paid to
the fact of Ogilvie’s experience as
opposed to Noell’s lack of it, and
how much of a factor it should be
in the election. Ogilvie stood on the
idea that experience gives one in-
sight into the problems faced in
properly administering the honor
system. When asked about Ogilvie’s
experience, Noell answered: Grant-
ed he has been exposed. How much
insight he has picked up, I don’t

The Journeymen, Odetta Featured Tonight
In First Of Two Springs Concerts For 1963

Springs Weekend, set to a
“Holiday in Havana’ theme,
gets underway this evening
with the appearance of Odetta

and Journeymen in the gym at
8 o'clock.

This year’s show features two ex-
tra attractions: it furnishes a blow-
out after a week of tense cam-
paigning for campus political offices,
and it coincides with a VMI week-
end which should supply dates un-
limited to the Minks.

Ed Croft, President of Springs, and
his vice presidents, will be intro-
duced in the figure at the concert
tonight. Vice presidents are John
Madison, Mike Jenkins, Pete Can-
dler, Lanier Woodrum, Bip Fauber,
John Gulick, and Tom Rains.

The Friday concert will be fol-
lowed Saturday night by a concert
featuring the Isley Brothers and Bo
Diddley, in accordance with the
trend toward more concerts and few-
er dances on big weekends.

Holiday in Havana”

The gym will be decorated with
palm trees and tropical scenes going
along with the theme of “Holiday in
Havana.” Mike Jenkins, vice pres-
ident in charge of decorations, says
that he has tried to catch the
beauty and splendor of the island of
Cuba in the decorations.

Tonight’s performers are some of
the biggest names in folk music to-
day. Odetta is hailed as one of the
truly great contemporary artists, not
only in the field of folk music, but
in blues as well. She has played
night clubs from “The Hungry i” to

the “Blue Angel.” Odetta records
for RCA and has cut several al-
bums.

The Publications Board has an-
nounced the selection of Roger
Paine, Phi Gam, and Ken Lane, Phi
Delt, as editors of next year’s Tues-
day and Friday editions of the
Ring-tum Phi respectively.

Walt McManus, Phi Psi, was named
business manager for both editions.

Tain Tompkins, Phi Gam, and
Diek MeEnally, Lambda Chi, were
selected as editor and business man-

ager respectively of the 1963-64
Southern Collegian.
Appearing Wednesday before the

Publications Board, which consists
of the present and past editors and
business manager of the Ring-tum
Phi, Southern Collegian, and Calyx,
these candidates were selected on
a basis of their qualifications, grades,
and experience. These newly ap-
pointed heads-of-staff will take
charge of their posts next fall.
Paine, a rising senior from Arling-
ton, Va., is president of the Publi-
cations Board and former editor of
the Southern Collegian, and current-
ly managing editor of the Tuesday
edition of the Ring-tum Phi and has
been on the Ring-tum Phi staff for

 

 

pop ballads, blues and modern jazz

as at folk singing. Their single re-|

cording of “Kumbahya” has been
their biggest hit to date. The group
consists of John Phillips, Richard
Weismann, and Scott McKenzie. The
trio was discovered by Frank Weber,
manager of the original Kingston
Trio.

Bo Diddley and the Isley Brothers,
slated for tomorrow night's concert,
have appeared at Washington and
Lee in the past. Bo Diddley has been
one of the biggest names in rock
and roll since 1955, when he rose
to fame with the hit recording of
“Bo Diddley.”

WGL Hit
By Death
Of Student

William D. Suggs, III, 21, a Wash-
ington and Lee University junior
from Richmond, Va., died Tuesday
in his room here of an apparently
self-inflicted wound.

Dr. E. V. Brush, Rockbridge
County Medical Examiner, said the
wound was “apparently self-inflict-
ed” by a double-barreled shotgun.
Dr. Brush set the time of Suggs’
death at approximately 2:30 p.m.

Suggs, the son of Dr. and Mrs.
William D. Suggs, was found by
two fellow students around 5 p.m.
Tuesday in his room in a small cot-
tage on the Kappa Alpha fraternity
grounds. Suggs was a member of
Kappa Alpha.

University officials said that Suggs
had given no indication of unusual
problems. University records showed
his grades were satisfactory.

In addition to his parents, Suggs
is survived by a sister.

A funeral service was held Thurs-
day at noon at St. Stephen’s Episco-

The Die Is Cast

Congratulations to the newly elected officers. Your victory
came about only because you earned it, not because of party
allegiance or lack of competition.

In toasting you, the leaders of next year’s student body,
we feel perhaps we are toasting the advent of a new epoch
at W&L. A new party was developed this year—a party under
the name Progressive. In past years, a party bearing such a
name would have been doomed. Moreover, in past years a
party bearing such a slate of candidates would have very likely

been doomed.

Why? Because your attitude and approach in campaigning
struck its appeal at a certain sentiment—a sentiment which has
become prominent at W&L only in recent years. That W&L
is undergoing a change is no longer a mere conversation piece.
It has decidedly become a reality during these elections!

The victory of the Progressive party, gentlemen, symbolizes
a transition. The “party of the University” has been defeated
by a totally new faction—a Progressive faction. The banner-
head this party has assumed would have been repulsed by the
student body of several years ago.

The candidates who won represent a striking contrast to
their opponents. This observation is particularly brought out
in the rivalry for student body president. Whether Bill Noell
should have won is no longer the question. The point to con-
sider is why. The answer, an answer which would have upset
previous student bodies, is that Noell relied on intellect as his
key vote-winning asset. He did not win a contest of popularity;
he won a contest of intelligence.

You, the defeated candidates of the University party—
are victims—victims of a serious change at W&L. All the beer
rallies in the world could not have saved you. Unfortunately or

not, you played for a definite appeal and lost.

—K. P. L.

 

Freshman Observes
Changes At W&L

By JIM BRUTON

Let's face it. W&L is no longer
“the party school of the party schools
of the South.” “Four years ago,”
a senior recently told me, “I could
stand in front of the Lyric Theater
on the Saturday night of a dance
weekend and hear wild screams all
the way from Red Square.”

“I could enter a fraternity house
the next day and see that a real
party had taken place. Now the old
social spirit of W&L has almost
disintegrated.”

New Type Freshman

Many students are aware of a
change on this campus—a change in
the attitude of each incoming class.
Against heavy competition the ad-
missions office at W&L, as well as
at other colleges, is forced to turn
its attention to the smarter, more
serious-minded student. Conse-
quently, each year’s crop of fresh-
men, including this one, appears less
inclined to maintain the old fra-
ternity and party spirit. Maybe this
is what another senior meant, when
he snapped at me, “You freshmen
are a bunch of finks.”

But if social vigah has decreased
as smart students increase, there
must be, at least, a lot of non-social
intellectual activity. There isn’t,
though, take for example, politics.
The student body is considered
overwhelmingly conservative, but
only 35 out of 1100 students are
members of the Conservative So-
ciety, and 10 out of that 35 put
out the Southern Conservative.

Lack of Participation

Look at the Ring-tum Phi. Most
of the work for it is done by just
a handfull. Look at the poor atten-
dance at some of the visiting lec-
tures (“Darn, there’s nothing to do
in Lexington.”), some of whom are
very noted men who have given bril-
liant talks. Consider the weak school
spirit and support we give at foot-
ball games.

The point I’m making is that, on
the whole, W&L students have be-
come dull and uninterested. A Ring-
tum Phi editorial of a few weeks
ago mockingly complained of the
lack of enthusiasm over anything:
“But alas, the panty raid, and all
that glorious tradition has seen its
day. A whole new generation of
college students has arisen since
that day—beetle-browed, _ serious,
grasping young intellectuals...The
student body is...smarter—duller.”

What happened to riots, picketing,
panty raids on Sem, effigy burning
of professors, or demonstrations for
Martin Luther King? What happen-
ed te the vibrant playboy of the
“golden days” that seniors talk
about? Where is the respected radi-
cal intellectual who does more than
just sit down and talk about “God,
sex, and world problems?”

 

Although fraternities are strug-
gling against formidable circum-
stances to stir up the old “hell-rais-
ing party spirit, they merely reflect,
on the other hand, the apathetic,
lackidaisical atmosphere pervading
W&L. Look in any house on campus
and you will find a number of “fra-
ternity vegetables.” These unique in-
dividuals, after entering a fraternity,
tend to isolate themselves in the
fraternity haven, seldom participat-
ing in any university functions. For
them the “tube,” the card-table, or
an occasional date on weekends is
enough exertion. Today, I might add,
fraternities must try to arouse and
stimulate its members to integrate
into rather than isolate themselves
from university life. Fraternities
must do this in order to justify
their existence.

The problem of inertness, intellec-
tual as well as social, is not con-
fined just to this campus. In col-
leges everywhere professors com-
plain of unfeeling, unexcitable, con-
forming students. But the fact that
the rest of the country is as bad as
we are is no reason for satisfaction.

Why can’t there be more contro-
versy (a left-wing club to needle
the conservatives); or some. vital
campus issues brought to light (1
mean specifically, by opposing can-
didates in the next student elec-
tions)? Why can’t we have an at-
mosphere which would give rise to
stimulating and enlightening pro-
grams (like the “Focus” held at
Randolph-Macon) ?

Of course we can’t turn back the
clock to the old days of the really
wild fraternity affairs such as co-
educational showers or bikini-jock-
strap parties. But one thing is cer-
tain. Until we at W&L become more
sensitive yet more excitable, more
aware yet more active in intellec-
tual, cultural, and academic pur-
suits—until we do this, then our
esteemed social life, which has given
W&L a name and us students pride,
will remain anemic.

Letter To The Editor

Dear Janitors,

Despite the high temperatures,
tempers, and humidity which have
struck this campus in the past week,
the heaters in the north wing of the
New Freshman Dorm have been left
going full blast, to the great dis-
comfort and chagrin of the occu-
pants thereof. Unfortunately, no
matter how much one tinkers with
the little knobs on the heaters, the
things still produce a considerable
amount of hear. Please, then, turn
these heaters off be fore we rise in
mass and do the job ourselves, an
operation which is not likely to be
very neat or condusive to the proper
functioning of the heaters next win-
ter.

Playboy Attacks U.S. Puritanism,
Blames Religion

By HUGH M. HEFNER
Editor of Playboy

(The following is a reprint of part
of a series recently appearing in
a popular magazine for erudite
young men.)

We have tried to show in previous
issues how an improper emphasis
on security and conformity stifled
this country for a generation and we
have pointed to signs that suggest,
to us, that initiative and the indivi-
dual may soon again be receiving
their proper due. But there has
been another stifling influence in
America—far more insidious—that
has pervaded our culture since the
nation’s beginnings, yet most of us
are only vaguely aware of its con-
tinuing effect on every facet of our
laws and lives.

Puritanism—as stultifying to the
mind of man as communism, or
any other totalitarian concept—has
been a part of the American cul-
ture since the country’s earliest
settlers landed on Plymouth Rock,
or thereabouts. For it matters little
if a book is burned because it con-
tains an unpopular political idea
or an unpopular moral or religious
one—the book has been burned
just the same—and society is alit-
tle poorer for having lost perhaps
just one small voice, one differ-
ence of opinion, one divergent
thought or idea.

We must never forget that this
democracy draws its matchless
strength from the continuous free
exchange of differing ideas and by
keeping open the channels of com-
munication for even the most un-
popular points of view. Our found-
ing fathers made the protection of
every minority and every minority
opinion of paramount importance in
both our Constitution and the Bill of
Rights. They recognized that down
through history great men and great
ideas have been unpopular in their
own time. Man learns slowly and
cultural changes that might other-
wise take years require generations
while those that might take genera-
tions sometimes take centuries. Soc-
rates, teacher of Plato, and recog-
nized today as one of the great phil-
osophers of history, was accused in
his own time of being without fixed
principles and sentenced to die by
drinking poison hemlock; Van Gogh,
the brilliant and prolific impression-
ist, sold only four paintings during
his lifetime, was driven mad by des-
pair and killed himself; Galileo was
twice tried by the Inquisition for
daring to suggest that the earth re-
volves around the sun; Christ was
nailed to a cross for teaching that
man should love his fellow man.

Progress necessarily requires the
exchange of outdated ideas for new
and better ones. By keeping open
all lines of communication in our
culture, every new idea—no mat-
ter how seemingly preverse, im-
proper or peculiar, has its opportu-
nity to be considered, to be chal-
lenged, and ultimately to be ac-
cepted or rejected by society as a
whole or by some small part of
it. This is the important advan-
tage that a free society has over
a totalitarian one, for in the free
exchange of ideas, the best will
ultimately win out. A dictatorship,
with its pre-established dogma, is
chained to the past; a free society
may draw from past, present and
the future.

Too often the most readily
acknowledged precepts become cli-
ches to which mere lip service is
paid while their real intent and sig-
nificance are lost.

In America we have built an en-
tire nation—a social order, economy
and government—on this concept of
freedom. And whatever shortcom-
ings it may seem to have are, we
believe, less inherent in the ideal
of a free society than they are the
result of our failing to keep faith
with that ideal. This not to suggest
that a nation as large and as com-
plex as this one is capable of re-
maining free for all without some
supervision and control. The eco-
nomie system of free enterprise, for
example, would not continue to
function successfully without cer-
tain necessary checks and balances. |
But it is important for us never to|

 

lose sight of the primary aim and
purpose of our government, which
should be to achieve and perpetuate
the maximum amount of freedom
and opportunity possible for all of its
citizens.

The freedom also includes free-
dom from ignorance, sickness,
poverty and fear without which
the other freedoms would be
meaningless. Our government is
sometimes likened to a parent, but
it must be careful not to become
a too overly protective parent,
whose guidance and _ control
smother initiative and self respect.

The individual remains the all im-
portant element in our society—the
touchstone against which all else
must be judged. The individual’s
very individuality—his right to look,
think and act as differently from his
fellows as he chooses (without of
course, interfering with the similar
rights of others)—supplies the di-
vergent, interacting components that
produce progress.

No group is necessarily more im-
portant than each individual member
of the group. Group thought is not
necessarily superior to individual
thought and neither is group taste.
It is our feeling, moreover, that ac-
tions taken to allegedly benefit one
group or another—the taxpayer, the
working man, the consumer, society,
the nation—too often benefit almost
no one. So-called “group good” is
is some times a vagary that shields
an activity that could not be justi-
fied on any individual basis.

All totalitarian concepts place
a particular group—a race, a re-
ligion, a class, a country—ahead of
the individual. Thus the political
extremes of right and left—social-
ism and communism on the one
hand and fascism and Nazism on
the other—have more in common,
each with the other, then they do
with democracy, whose system of
checks and balances places it at
the political center. Einstein’s
theory of curved space would seem
to apply to the political universe
as well as the physical one: the
opposite extremes of political dog-
ma eventually meet.

It is not enough to recognize that
a nation is no more important than
the sum of all of its people: a country
is no more important than each of
its citizens, taken singly, and apart

 

For Lost Rights

from all the rest. For only through
concern and respect for each mem-
ber of society can the whole of so-
ciety hope to achieve its ultimate
potential.
American Puritanism

Our founding fathers established
protections for America’s individual
citizens in both the Constitution of
the United States and the Bill of
Rights, assuring that this nation’s
rule by the majority would always
be tempered with a concern for the
rights and privileges of the most
insignificant of our minorities.

American jurisprudence is es-
pecially concerned with the protec-
tion of the individual, differing from
much of Europe’s law in that a man
must always be considered innocent
until proven guilty; and further, that
we would rather allow four guilty
men to go free than unjustly con-
vict one who is innocent.

With such an acute awareness
of the importance of protecting the
rights and freedom of every indi-
vidual in our society, it is inter-
esting to see how and why many of
these rights have been lost. Please
do not consider us impious if we
suggest that it is American religion
that is largely to blame.

Since many of the early settlers
left Europe for the New World spe-
cifically because of religious perse-
cution, it seems especially strange
that they should adopt the very
practices from which they had so
recently fled. Nevertheless, that is
precisely what they did.

Organized religion, as separated
from any personal faith, has had a
considerable civilizing influence upon
mankind through all of history; it
has fostered hope, charity and edu-
cation. But bloody wars have also
been fought because of it, and mil-
lions kept in abject poverty, tortured
and executed in the vilest ways.

Presumably, a man’s religion
should make him a beter person—
more tolerant, sympathetic and
understanding towards his fellows.
Too often organized religion has
had the opposite effect, placing its
emphasis on orthodoxy instead of
understanding and emphasizing
ritual and dogma rather than the
spiritual founding principles of
faith and love. And make no mis-
take—the tyranny of man over his
fellow man is just as great an evil

when it is wielded in the name of
God as in the name of the state.

The early Puritans who settled
in America did not see their religion
as simply one aspect of life, but the
whole of it. As Puritan leader Jona-
than Edwards wrote in describing
the Christian’s “practice of religion”;
“It may be said, not only to be his
business at certain seasons, the busi-
ness of Sabbathdays, or certain ex-
traordinary times, or the business of
a month, or a year, or seven years,
or his business under certain cir-
cumstances; but the business of his
life.” This attitude is shared by a
great many religious people, of var-
ious faiths, today. And as far as it
goes, it can hardly be criticized.
But it must be recognized that in
defining the “practice of religion”
as a full-time, 24-hour-a-day prop-
osition, religion pervades, directs
and controls the totality of human
life and thought. Religion may thus
be used to justify the regulation of
all man’s activity—and, indeed, it
has been.

The early Puritan in America is
described by the Encyclopaedia
Britannica as “a_ spiritual athlete,
characterized by an intense zeal to
reform, a zeal to order everything—
personal life, family life, worship,
church, business affairs, political af-
fairs, even recreation—in the light of
God’s demand upon him.” This re-
ligion required conformity and things
went badly for those early Ameri-
cans who proved unwilling to con-
form.

If authenticated cases of “witch
burning” were relatively unknown
in early America (compared to the
thousands of religious executions
in Europe by fire, drawing and
quartering, boiling in oil, disem-
bowlment and a great variety of
other tortures too numerous to
catalog here, throughout the 16th,
17th and 18th Centuries) our Pur-
itan forefathers had other subtler
ways of keeping the citizens in
line—public floggings, the stocks,
the scarlet letter, the ducking
stool and an occasional hanging—
all for relatively minor infringe-
ments of the religious dicta of the
time.

The Britannica further describes
the daily routine of the Puritan as
having involved “the keeping of a
spiritual diary in which the events
of the day were closely serutinized
and an accounting made of moral
successes and failures as well as note
being taken of the signal evidences
of divine grace or displeasure that
had been disclosed during the course
of the day.” And if all thls strikes
the reader as being more like Or-
well’s 1984 than the beginnings of
democracy in America, we can only
add a solemn amen.

seventh and eighth innings when
the Hoyas’ pulled the game out of

leaving men on base. Washington and
Lee had seven chances to score
and only capitalized on two of them.
The Generals’ biggest threats came
in the seventh and ninth innings. In
the seventh with bases loaded and
one out Eric Sisler, the lead off man,
popped out to second and Ashley
Allen popped out to third base.
The ninth was a repeat of the sev-
enth: with bases loaded and one
gone both Sisler and Allen popped
out.

The Generals’s runs came in the
sixth and seventh innings. Sisler
reached first on an error charged to
the shortstop. Allen sacrificed mov-
ing Sisler to second. With Sisler on
second, captain Chuck Lane slammed
a long triple to left field. All this
took place with two away. The in-
ning ended as Lane was caught try-
ing to steal home. The Generals’
second run came in the seventh

ended in the seventh by an untimely
single. Nevertheless, Gamber held
the Hoyas to only four hits.

Four Hits

The Generals had four hits, all
by different men. Sisler singled,
Lane trippled, and both Taylor and
Gamber singled. The overall ap-
pearance of the team semed to have
been improved greatly from their
game with the University of Connec-
tieut.

Georgetown scored three runs on
four hits and four Washington and
Lee errors. W&L got two runs on
the same amount of hits and seven
Georgetown errors. Captain Lane
is now 12 for 25 and leads the
team with a .480 average.

An interesting point came in the
sixth inning when, as Lane broke
for the plate from third, the pitcher,
still not having placed his foot on
the rubber, became Georgetown’s
“seventh infielder” and threw Lane
out at the plate.

The Generals face a tough RPI
team next Thursday. The team has
compiled a 1 and 6 record for the
year so far.

W&L came out on the short end of
the score 7714-534.

In last wek’s Hampden-Sydney
meet most of the team had _ their
best performances of the year and
are looking for ward to improving
on them after intense workouts
this week. Freshman Don Casto
looked fine in the sprints and Andy
Kilpatrick shows signs of return-
ing to his old form. With strong
performance from each member of
the squad, W&L may reverse the
1955 score and chalk up their sec-
ond victory of the season.

John Baker in action against Hoyas. His fast-moving game

game lead W&L to victory.

Tennis Team Soundly Trounces
Georgetown: John Baker Shines

The W&L tennis team scored its
first victory of the season by soundly
defeating Georgetown University 6-
3 Tuesday. The match was much
closer than the score indicates and
the Generals were doubtful of their
victory right up to the final doubles
match.

The two teams split the singles
matches 3-3. DeYoung come from
behind to beat Wolf of Georgetown
2-6, 6-2, 6-4. Captain John Baker de-
feated his opponent 6-2, 2-6, 6-3.
and Jones easily handled Fay of
Georgetown 6-3, 6-1. Having swept
the first three singles matches, the
Generals faltered and lost the next
three. John Mell lost to Bowes 3-6,
6-4, 6-3; Lindsey Short lost a tough
one 6-3, 7-5; and Howard Busse lost
to the Hoyas’ Gargaro 1-6, 6-4, 6-2.

With the match tied up the net-
men had to take two of the three
doubles matches. In the first match
DeYoung and Jones teamed up to

defeat Wolf and Hodgman of George-
town 6-4, 6-2. Following this match
John Baker and Lindsey Short took
on Fay and Bowes and barely won
6-4, 1-6, 8-6. In the last match
Mell and Mill defeated Dolan and
DeCarr 2-6, 6-3, 6-4.

The Generals’ record now stands
at 1-1, having previous lost to
Hampden-Sydney. The team travels
to Lynchburg to meet their team
on April 22. Lynchburg is tough in
the singles department with Berry
being their best man. Nevertheless,
they shouldn’t present too much of
a problem to the W&L netmen. Pos-
sibly the toughest match of the sea-
son will be against George Wash-
ington on April 29.

Sophomore Chris Wigert walked
only one, struck-out six in six in-
nings, and the Generals pounded out
nineteen hits as the team coasted to
a 10-7 victory over RPI at Richmond
yesterday.

Wigert’s fast ball and cure were
especially effective as the RPI Bat-
ters could muster only six singles
off him before he tired in the sev-
enth. He also helped his own cause
by hitting two singles to add to
his single and home run of last week.
This makes Wigert’s second victory
for the season and the second time
he was influencial in a W&L vic-
tory.

The Generals again started fast as
they jumped to a three-run lead in
the first inning. Sisler opened the
inning with a single and then Chuck
Lane made the score 2-0 as he
boomed a towering fly ball which
went for a home run. Three straight
singles by Flannigan, Taylor and
Martin added the other run and the
Generals never lost the lead.

 

 

In the fifth W&L added three more
runs to make the score 8-1 by the
end of the inning. Flannigan hit a
single, and after a ground out to
short, Martin, Rose, and Davis fol-
lowed with three hits spaced around
a double steal which added three
more runs to the General’s lead.

It wasn’t until the seventh that
RPI could muster a rally, which, for
all purposes, was too late, It was
evident that the Generals felt they
had the game sown up because they
made four errors in the seventh and
eighth which allowed four runs to
cross the plate.

The Generals completely over-
powered RPI as they outhit them
19-13. Sisler, Flannigan, and Lane
each had three hits for W&L while
Martin and Taylor collected two
apiece. What was even more pleas-
ing was the fact that the Generals
had nine RBI's. Shultz looked good
for RPI with a home run and 2
singles.

FILLING A WELL-NEEDED GAP

Although my son is a college freshman, I am glad to say that
he is still not too old to climb up on my lap and have a heart-
to-heart talk when things are troubling him. My boy is enrolled
at Harvard where he is studying to be a fireman. From the
time he was a little tiny baby he always said he wanted to be
a fireman. Of course, my wife and I believed that he would
eventually grow out of it, but no sir, the little chap never
wavered in his ambition for one minute!

So here he is at Harvard today taking courses in net holding,
mouth-to-mouth breathing, carbon tetrachloride, and Dalma-
tian dogs. It is a full schedule for the young man, and that, in
fact, is exactly what we talked about when last he climbed
upon my lap.

He complained that every bit of his time is taken up with his
major requirements. He doesn’t have so much as one hour a
week to sample any of the fascinating courses outside his major
—history, literature, language, science, or any of the thousand
and one things that appeal to his keen young mind.

I am sure that many of you find yourselves in the same
scholastic bind; you are taking so many requirements that you
can’t find time for some appealing electives. Therefore, in to-
day’s column I will forego levity and give you a brief survey in
a subject that is probably not included in your curriculum.

oy
a

on

I have asked the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes whether I
might employ this column—normally a vehicle for innocent
merriment—to pursue this serious end. ‘“‘Of course you may,
crazy kid,” they replied kindlily, their grey eyes crinkling at
the corners, their manly mouths twisted in funny little grins.
If you are a Marlboro smoker—and what intelligent human
person is not?—you would expect the makers of Marlboro to
be fine men. And so they are—wonderful guys, every man-jack
of them—good, generous, understanding, wise. They are each
tipped with a pure white filter and come in soft pack or Flip-
Top box.

But I digress. We were going to take up a topic you are
probably unable to cover in your busy academic life. Let us
start with the most basic topic of all—anthropology, the study
of man himself.

Man is usually defined as a tool-making animal, but I per-
sonally do not find this definition entirely satisfactory. Man is
not the only species which makes tools. The simians, for ex-
ample, make monkey wrenches.

Still, when you come to a really complicated tool—like a
linotype, for instance—you can be fairly sure it was made by
Homo sapiens —or else a very intelligent tiger. The question one
should ask, therefore, is not who made the tool, but what did
he do with it.

For example, in a recent excavation in the Olduvai Gorge a
large assortment of hominoid fossils was found, all dating back
to the Middle Pleistocene Age. Buried with the fossils was a
number of their artifacts, the most interesting being a black
metal box which emitted a steady beeping sound. Now, of
course, Zoologists will tell you that tree frogs make such boxes
which they employ in their mating activities (I can’t go into
detail about it in this family newspaper) but the eminent an-
thropological team, Mr. and Mrs. Walther Sigafoos (both he
and she are named Walther) were convinced that this particular
box was made not by tree frogs but by Neanderthal men. To
prove their point, they switched on the box and out came
television, which, as everyone knows, was the forerunner of fire.

If there is anything more you need to know about anthro
pology, just climb up or my lap as soon as my son leaves

1963 Max Shulman

The makers of Marlboro Cigarettes who sponsor this column, often
with trepidation, are not anthropologists. They are tobacconists—
good ones, I think—and I think you'll think so too when you sample
their wares—available wherever cigarettes are sold in all fifty
states.

Alford Predicts “Third Man’ |

In Future Campus Elections

By PETE ALFORD

The election is over. In the past

this has been the time for all those

issues and propo-|

% sals which seemed

: so paramount for |

ss } a week to slip into

* obscurity. Will

. — it happen again
5 this year?

Mr. Noell, Mr.
Supak, and Mr.
Wright who claim
to be Progressives
; and ran this week

Alford on a fairly con-

crete platform of

things they want to see enacted by

next year’s Executive Committee.

This time it might be different. We
hope so.

 

There are several general obser-
vations that can be made about
the election. The first is the truely
amazing turnout at the polls. In
the law school we are informed
all but seven students exercised
their right to vote.

A total of only fifty student or so
in the entire university didn’t go to
the Student Union yesterday and
cast a ballot. We feel this is due
in part to the fine candidates on
both sides and the issues discussed,

was due to the fact that with a
nine-nine split in the houses, the
NFU and law school vote became
more important.

The fraternities generally vote
to the man every year, but with
the two parties more equal in
numbers than they have been the
non-fraternity and law vote be-
comes more important.

Both parties are going to have to
realize that the NFU and law school
will have to be behind them if they
expect to win. For years the Univer-
sity party has tried to placate the
law school by including one on the
ticket, but this year even that didn’t
work.

In the distant future we can

Generals Win
(Continued from page 3)

W&L’s young baseball team is de-
definitely improving. With only two

| seniors on the team and most of

; the subs being sophomores and
le ;
| freshmen, W&L is showing great

potential. The good pitching by
| Gamber, Wigert, and MeGowin is a
pleasant surprise and the club is
really bustling.

On Tuesday the Generals play
Lynchburg after very little oppor-
tunity for practice. Their record now
stands at 2-5 and they seem to be
gaining momentum after dropping
their first four games.

The Trend Towards Seminars

There is a slowly-developing trend at Washington and
Lee toward seminar courses which is very encouraging. Before
saying anything more, it should be mentioned that this trend
is necessarily slow because both the money available for the
additional seminar courses and the time professors need to teach
such courses are scarce. But if department heads will focus
attention on possibilities for such courses in the next few years,
adding more to the ones currently offered, the student body
would profit immensely.

The English department, which previously had only three
courses dealing with specific figures (Shakespeare, Milton, and
Chaucer), has added a seminar course to begin next year which
we feel could be a model for seminars in other departments.
The plan for this course is reported on page one today in the
absence of a spring catalogue.

A seminar course which is limited to eight ar ten students,
which is taught in the discussion method, and which is inten-
sive rather than extensive in its subject, would prepare students
for graduate work in their field of study, and help them to
find a specific center of interest. The plan of the English de-
partment to rotate the subjects taught from year to year is
sound in that it allows for seminars in many subjects, and since
an old course was eliminated to make way for the new one,
the problems of financing and scheduling were minimized.

Although the History department has several courses in
Modern European history, opportunities for concentrated
seminar work in Modern European history should be explored.
Over a period of two years, four different seminars could be
offered: 1815 to 1848; 1848 to 1900; 1900 to 1933; and
1933 to the present. By making these seminars available to
seniors and juniors with permission of the department head,
history majors planning to do graduate work would be pre-
pared for their future study.

Another suggestion for both the history and the political |
science departments is a year-long course in socialism and in
the evolution of communism out of socialism and the evolu-
tion of fascism. Socialism could be studied the first semester,
and the second two systems in 1 the second semester. The semi-

Editor Of Shenandoah Reviews Past Year

Nature of Shenandoah |

Mr. Boatwright describes Shenan- |
doah as “typical of dozens of ‘little |
magazines’ published by colleges and |
universities.” Rather limited in their |
appeal, they do not try to cater to
a general public or achieve high cir-
culation rates. Mr. Boatwright feels
that they are important because}
they can introduce writers that are
new, controversial, or important but
overlooked by the larger magazines.

“We are under no advertising pres-
sure,” he states, “and consequently |
are able to provide an 1 exception t to!

It may come as a surprise to some
students that Washington and Lee
publishes a literary review known
Shenandoah, a quarterly affair
that includes fiction, poetry, and erit-
icism, by both well-established and
fast-rising American writers. In the
past year there have been contri-
butions by E. E. Cummings, Robert
Penn Warren, Cleanth Brooks, Rich-
ard Eberhart, and other representa-
tives of contemporary literature.

nar in socialism could go back to the earliest socialist writings
after the French revolution, and follow their development as
far as possible. This seminar could be offered to both political
science and history majors, and the instruction could be done
by men from both departments.

Possibilities are unlimited, of course. Putting them into
actual practice is another thing. Every department should think
in practical terms, using introspection to determine a course
which could be eliminated in order to make way for a more
worthwhile seminar. We hope that something along this line
will be considered by all departments.

Wine, Roses and Rum

They are not long, the days of wine and roses;
Out of a misty dream

Our path emerges for a while, then closes
Within a dream.

 

—Ernest Dowson

Last Thursday the enthusiasm throughout the student body |
regarding this past weekend was at high pitch. It was so high,
in fact, that the local ABC store ran out of Bacardi Light Rum
Friday afternoon and Gilby’s Gin Saturday afternoon. Yet
the weekend can be termed a qualified success at best.

This year has proved two things: rock-and-roll entertainers
are at least relatively unreliable, and they are somewhat less
than satisfactory when they perform at a school-wide concert.
No one needs to be reminded of Clyde McPhatter’s absence
Friday night of openings, or of Frank Young’s decision the
following night that the Coaster’s were not fit to perform. Last
Saturday night Bo Diddley did not arrive until 9:15, 45 min-
utes before he went on stage.

These things put premature gray hairs in the heads of
Dance Board Presidents. Most of the problems this year have
been caused by rock-and-roll musicians, who were hired be-
cause a poll of the Student Body last spring indicated that this
type of music had top preferment.

Though we do not rule out a rock-and-roll weekend as a
potentially entertaining one, we believe that it was overdone

Fancy Dress Ball, for example, was one of the most successful
concerts in the past five years. The big band, and the person-
ality of its leader, plus the experience of performing for large
crowds, made the concert the success it was.

Rock-and-roll music, in order to be fully enjoyed, must or-
dinarily be in a smaller room than Doremus Gymnasium,
and have as its partners some form of alcohol and room to
dance. Fraternity houses supply this type of entertainment in
abundance all year long.

To call the groups that performed at the Saturday Concert
“entertainers” would be a euphemism of the first degree.
Both the Isley Bfothers and Bo Diddley have made their repu-
tations on the basis of one hit, and have done little to substan-
tiate admiration since. “Shout” was old last year. More import-
ant, neither group seemed to feel that they had to exert them-
selves to divert the audience.

Diddley was especially lacking; where the Isley Brothers
were incapable of doing a good job, he was frankly unwilling
and even insulting. Remember that the twenty-five dollars
that you shelled out last September goes to pay for just a
few seconds of one performance—those seconds, perhaps, that
Bo Diddley took to leer at you while he was trying to decide
what to play next.

We have some suggestions. There are entertainers who do
entertain, who look upon entertaining as their profession and
who take the time to work up a show that will keep the atten-
tion of the audience. Golden slacks are no substitute for this.

There are also many good groups which are new and which
try hard to win approval on their way to the top. The Journey-
men are a good example of this—their performance was un-
doubtedly the best received of the weekend. This is especially
true of many folk groups, such as Ian and Sylvia, and blues
singers such as the Mose Allison Trio. Though they do not
have big names, they are very likely to provide a good concert
because they want to be liked.

It would also be a good idea to try different types of en-
tertainment. One of the “New Wave” comedians, such as
Shelly Berman or Mort Sahl would certainly be a welcome
change. The success of the Dave Brubeck concert last Fancy
Dress indicates a desire for more modern jazz concerts.

The poll last year was a good idea, and its results directed
many of Frank Young’s decisions this year. If the student body
is tired of rock-and-roll concerts as it seemed to be on Saturday
night, the results of a new poll would prove it. We strongly
support a change of pace. These days of wine, roses and rum
do not last long, and it would be a shame to see part of them
wasted watching performances such as those of the Isley Broth-

ers and Bo Diddley last Saturday.

 

 

lished ones is about even because the |
‘known ones, though consistently |
| good, are hard to get.”

Speoking of the relationship be-
tween the magazine and undergrad-
uates, Mr. Boatwright says that
“there should not be, nor is there,
any significant —connection.. You |
simply cannot combine undergradu-
ate work with the work of the writ-
ers we publish. Of course, a campus
needs a student literary magazine
and this campus has a very good
one—John Refo has done a very
good job with Ariel.”

dled study of man’s inability to
communicate with others. He is a
master of composition; and in this
movie and “La Notte (The Night)
he establishes an expert style. A
style which is slow and careful; a
style filled with both wit and melan-
choly; a style that is superbly suited
to his subject.

His actress, Monica Vitti, gives a
performance that completely opens
her character for examination. This
is too good a film to miss. But you
;must be willing to accept a film
| with little action and studied move-
'ment. It is not a fast action film.
|It is a meticulous work of art,
though possibly for a limited audi-
lence of film enthusians.

 

Several persons have questioned
/me about placing “Lolita” so high
on my list of the year’s best films.
I believe I ranked it second. (Just
to show you how silly these lists are,
|I would now list it first. It’s like
|the Associated Press trying to de-
| cide between Cincinnati and Duke,
when Loyola is the best team of the
three. It’s merely an_ interesting
game tht we all enjoy playing.) But
to defend “Lolita” would take at
least a full column.

Claims ‘Lolita’ No. 1 In 1962;
Praise ‘L’ Adventura’ At Lyric Now

|

I will briefly say that there was|
an aura of sophistication about the
film which was unparalleled in my |
viewing. I laughed more during}
“Lolita” than in any other two-hour |
period in my whole life. Add to these |
facts that James Mason gave one of |
the finest portrayals in cinema his- |
tory as Humbert, that the support- |
ing cast was particularly excellent, |
and that Nelson Riddle’s music was |
nearly as clever as Stanley Kubrick's |
direction, and you begin to under-|
stand my enthusiasm. |

Praise From Many Critics

If what you want is support for}
my opinion, then ask some profes- |
sors who are movie buffs or read |
Esquire, New Republic, Newsweek, |
Saturday Review, or Sight and |
Sound, I am not alone in my praise. |

tura” is playing at the Lyric.

Fr. Laval’s Visit |
Called Success

 

By BILL LOWRY
Often, a visitor to our campus
community can give us valuable.

insights, not only into a particular,
subject matter or discipline but!
into our own frame of reference as,
well. Such was certainly the case
regarding Father Jacques Laval,
a French Dominican Priest, who
visited W&L under the auspices of
ReVue.

Father Laval stayed as the guest
of Prof. Jay Taylor of the French
Department, taking his meals at the
ZBT house, in addition to visiting
with students at Sigma Chi, and
various other groups. He also gave
several talks on various subjects,
speaking on the Mass and St. Dom-
inic to Dr. Sprunt’s class on Chris-
tian Doctrine; on “The Christian
and Love” Wednesday night in
duPont Hall; and on “Sacred Art:
Is it Still Possible?” to a combined
meeting of R. E. Lee Episcopal and
St. Patrick’s Roman Catholic
Churches.

In addition, he attended the con-
cert on Friday night, went to sev-
eral parties around campus, and
went on Sunday morning to a serv-
ice at the Negro Methodist Church.

His own background is impressive,
and made him all the more quali-
fied as a speaker. A member of the}
Dominican Order, he now lives in
Paris working with the artists’ com-
munity. He spent last year at the
University of Mexico as an assistant
Chaplain; has made five films on
art; served as the television director
to Pope Pius XII. During Lent, he
delivered over ninety lectures and
sermons in Quebec.

In his talk Sunday night, Father
Laval began by declaring that art
is not something to be understood,
| but to be felt. All art, if it is really
| art, expresses something of the pres-
| ence of God; therefore, all good art

| is “sacred art.”

journalists accompanied by their

instructors began to arrive on the)
Washington and Lee campus yes-|

terday afternoon for the 34th an-

listened last night to the W&L Glee
Club and the Sweet Briar College
Choir in Doremus Gymnasium.
Delegates at the convention this

‘Cheek Walker Receives IFC
Outstanding Frosh Award

By CHARLES NEWMAN

the Interfraternity Council

IFC Charity Drive and a plan for'
housing foreign students in frater- |
nity houses were discussed. They
also elected the outstanding Fresh-
man for this year.

The IFC Charity Drive was not
as successful this year as the IFC
feels it could have been. It was
decided that the representatives
would ask their individual houses if
they would be willing to support the
fund next year, and if so, how many
people in each house would support
it. From this poll they will determine |
whether or not to further the exist-
ing program.

Exchange Student Housing

 

The idea of placing three foreign
students in fraternity houses has
been discussed before. A list will be|
made up consisting of the fraterni-|
ties that are willing to house one of |
| the students. The student will live

 

and eat at the house. From the
list the IFC will choose three houses.
The cost will be paid by the IFC.
Chuck Walker, Kappa Sigma, from
San Antonio, Texas, was chosen Out-
standing IFC Freshman. Chuck is a
Phi Eta Sigma, a member of the
Dance Board Advisory Committee
and Floor Committee, ran varsity
cross-country, indoor track, and
spring track. He is also on the busi-
ness staff of the Shenandoah, mem-
ber of the Young Republican Club
and International Relations Club,
and secretary of his fraternity.
The IFC also discussed a_ topic
from the outline of the Student-
Faculty Discussion, which was held
earlier this year. The topic was the
relationship of the fraternity men to
the non-fraternity men and how this
relationship can be improved.
There was also approved a motion
to send three senior IFC members to
sit in on the meetings of the Faculty
Committee on Fraternities. The Fac-

“Fear of Change”

Miss Mannes’ speech, entitled
“Fear of Change,” concerned itself
with her conviction that today’s

youth are afraid of variety in life.
She said: “Fear of change makes a
teenager marry her teenage date be-
fore she has a chance to know any
other boy. Fear of change makes a
young man take a sure and boring
job instead of an interesting, adven-
turous one.”

Miss Mannes went on to say that
she felt too many American youths
were allowing themselves to be con-
tent with the status quo. She blam-
ed this factor on a lack of forward-
looking leadership from the govern-
ment, the pupit, the educational sys-
tem, the press, and the business com-
munity. Speaking of the press spe-
cifically, she said: “Both press and
television have their share of cour-
ageous spokesmen who report and
comment truthfully on our life and
times, but overlaying their voices are
a million commercial messages a day
telling us, in one way or another,
that happiness consists of a new
dishwasher, a new car, or a new
hairdo, and that our way of life is
the only way.”

Youth Needs An Open Mind

Miss Mannes pointed out that
many young people close their minds
at an early age to the things which
are aspects of another culture rath-
er than keeping an open mind and
approaching unfamiliar subjects with
reason. She claimed that social, po-
litical, and biological revolutions
are mere surface concerns in com-
parison with the “deep sickness” in
American society: inertia and
atrophy.”

The state of the nation was de-
scribed by Miss Mannes as follows:
“On the one hand, we proclaim our

Christian morality as a society un-
der God. On the other hand, cor-
ruption has spread to a prodigious
degree in ever sector of our life.
It ranges from a two dollar bet to
a twenty-thousand bribe, from falsi-
fiers of tax-returns to a dishonest
city official, from cheaters at ex-
aminations to misleading advertisers,
from corrupt union-leaders to price-
fixing corporations. It would be com-
forting to say that these are ex-
ceptions. The truth is that they have
made the line between legal and
illegal, moral and immoral, so blur-
red that a majority of our people can
no longer see it clearly anymore.”

Miss Mannes’ solution lay in the
hope that the individual will assert
himself actively in our society, and
that individual interests will over-
come the narcotic effects of con-
formity and apathy.

Rebels Without A Cause?

The advent of Spring brings with it a long-standing tra-
dition to our what is normally peaceful campus. This tradition
we cautiously term “rioting,” which we write with quotation
marks since it is no more than a harmless, fun-loving way of
blowing off steam. The tradition is commonly perpetuated
by the freshman class, and early this week the class of 1966
made its contribution.

Of course it’s all in good fun. The freshmen love it, the
upperclassmen love it, the administration loves it, and the dorm
counselors bear it with a minimum of chagrin and frayed
nerves.

But this year’s “riots” almost received a fatal blow. There
was a dire absence of things to riot about. Simply no injustices
could be found outrageous enough to rally spirits. The “‘riot-
ing” came to an embarrassing pause while something had to
be pulled out of the hat.

Once the “riots” got underway—they started without wait-
ing for an issue—some worthy cause was finally hit upon.
It centered on a concern which often visits the editorial page—
the Commons, the campus dining hall. So the “riots” went
along smoothly, everyone got it out of their system, and things
will be quiet for another year.

But should this be the end of the story? What we want to
know is, if the freshmen are showing this fanatical concern for
their stomachs, why doesn’t someone accommodate their de-
mands. If such is the case, no expense should be spared to
meet these needs. Why nonchalantly bypass the issue if that
is where today’s academic interests have focussed?

The freshmen have set high their goals. This is certainly
commendable. By all means, it is up to this university to en-
courage ideal thinking. If it’s the Waldorf-Astoria the fresh-
men want, then why not? Petitions should be drawn up as
soon as possible to voice these demands. Start with a petition
for a revision of the school menu: from now on, the warcry
will be roast duck, tenderloins, and broiled lobster! And with
five o'clock cocktails thrown in!

The source of funds for such a change should not be dif-
ficult to find. For instance, we could cut teachers’ salaries,
research grants, or the library allowance (if the latter can be
cut) and allocate the proceeds to the Commons budget. After
all, if cuisine is the chief interest of our ‘angry young men,”’
this university should take every step to oblige.

The solution is brought before you. Freshmen are en-
couraged to begin their petitions right away. We only ask this:
make sure you don’t do too good a job—leave next year’s

 

freshmen something to be desired.

judged. Some of them will also
sample a bit of college life, or hope-
fully so.

On June 7 the present senior
class will graduate from Washing-
ton and Lee and many of the van-
ishing herd will leave Lexington,
never to return as undergraduates.
Next fall another class of fresh-
men—the thundering herd—will
join the ranks and return to the
university to numerical normali-
ty, but they will never replace
those graduating.

Much has been written about the
changing complexion of the Uni-
versity and whether it is welcome
or not to some it is a fact. We were
relieved to see that Springs this year
seemed to possess echoes of past
great weekends and that the vanish-
ing herd is still letting its presence
be known.

MISCELLANY

Though we have no desire to ini-
tiate a spat on the pages of the
Ring-tum Phi with columnist Pace
of the Tuesday edition for no reason
at all, we feel he has made an
error.

Mr. Pace persists in ranking
“Lolita” as one of the best movies
of 1962 and last Tuesday even
called it the year’s best. Mr.
Pace places a lot of stock, as
he should, in the direction,
reviewing a flick. The observer
feels that adaptation should also
be considered and anyone who
has read “Lolita” realizes that the
movie bears little resemblance to
the book.

The Tuesday reviewer also states
that he laughed more during “Lo-
lita” than any other two-hour period
in his whole life, and we wonder
if the movie was made to be laughed
at. After Peter Seller’s opening hit,
which was truly funny, the movie
Was supposed to become serious.
Many people did in fact laugh
throughout the whole movie and
this to us seems to denote its
failure and should relegate it to the

bottom of the list of the best movies!

The IU Makes Correction
Dear Sir:

As members of the Steering Com-
mittee of the Independent Union,
we thought it would be wise to
clarify some of the points raised by
Mr. Bob Lee in last Tuesday’s
Ring-tum Phi.

In the first place, the Independent
Union did not claim to speak, nor
does it intend to speak for every
non-fraternity student. The Inde-
pendent Union speaks only for those
students who wish to identify with
the Union.

In the second place, no mention
of political parties was made in the
official endorsement of the slate; to
the contrary, the endorsement ex-
plicitly stated that candidates were
being supported on the basis of in-
dividual qualifications, attitudes and
abilities.

The Independent Union will con-
tinue to participate in campus poli-
ties, intramural athletics, and what-
ever other activities its members
see fit. Mr. Lee and his friends are
free to participate or to abstain as
they see fit. But, in the light of the
support given the Union by the other
nonfraternity students during the re-
cent elections, we might wonder just
who has “delusions of grandeur.”....

Respectfully,

Is There Any Change?

Dear Sir:

As a concerned member of this
community I was struck by your
statement in last Friday’s Ring-
tum Phi that “Washington and Lee
is undergoing a change.” It would
seem you feel that this change is
in the direction of a more mature}
and intellectual outlook on the part
of the students. What you say may
be true, but let’s look at the record.

Where was this new outlook dur-
ing last Friday’s concert when a
fine artist like Odetta need endure
a disrespectful audience? Or where
was it last weekend when some
“young gentlemen” viciously demol-
ished a room in one of the fraterni-
ty houses? The list of similar oc-
curences, just within this academic
year could go on for pages.

Students guilty of such action as
those mentioned above would seem
unfit for life in the so-called “com-
munity of scholars.” Simple “letting
off steam” can and should be tol-
erated. But why must enjoyment
and good fun dissipate into violence
and vulgarity?

The proper authorities at Wash-
ington and Lee must realize that
they have to take severe disciplinary
action now in order to put an end
to this childish behavior and make
the University’s alleged “new epoch”
a truthful deseription.

for advanced, imaginative, creative,
independent work which most of us, |
I suspect, don’t know about. Here_
are some of them:

In the college: (1) An Interde-.

a single department. Indepartmental
Majors in the area of General Hu-

Totalitarianism at WXL
Dear Sir:

Someone once said that if totali-|
tarianism ever came to the US,!
it would be in the guise of 100 per
cent Americanism. Perhaps at the
moment this could be more appro- |
priately called 100 per cent South-
ernism.

There have been within the last}
few days some disturbances on the |
part of the freshman class—noisy but |
basically harmless demonstrations |
over legitimate grievances—although |
admittedly prompted by Spring |
Fever. |

The administration, however, has!
reacted in a typically infantile and|
foolish manner. We now have pa-)
trol’s of Philip's Gestapo dorm
councilors with searchlights, unre- |
stricted searches (illegal), and
threats of expulsion—all the ele-|
ments of a police state. We are told
that we are immature, but the ad- |
ministration is more so.

ticularly when
both happen to be
Negroes.

The Negro has
traditionally been
the world’s best
musician. His natural love of rhy-
thm, combined with an approach
to life which is often delightfully
sensuous and carefree, weave rich
patterns of music around all he
does. We believe that the Negro
is still not far from the primitive
earth of his jungle background and
that he often expresses this lush
heritage in his music. That is the
belief. However, the Negro is no
longer an African singing against
an African backdrop; he is an
American singing of things both
past and present—the river boats,
cotton fields, a prostitute’s life in
New Orleans, the blues, the De-
pression, and on and on. There are
no Negroes left now with memories
of Africa of which to sing, but there
are other things to sing about, plen-
ty of other memories; and the Negro
best expresses these musically.

Where does the appeal of the
Negro lie? The question is rhetorical.
Of course, his appeal is to the emo-

   

Kinsey

tional reaction from his audience de-
termines his success as a performer.
Moreover, the response he achieves
is most often an active one, for
the listener is tempted to tap his
foot, clap his hands, or dance. The
rhythm of the musie plants in the
listener’s mind a suggestion which
he follows by moving in time with
the music. Thus is effected a ca-
tharsis.s When the music is over
and all is quiet again, the listener
finds that his level of emotional
intensity has dropped and he thinks
no more about it. He is content.
Music Has Message
Music—all types included—quite
often carries a serious message.
There are probably just as many
songs of protest as there are songs
of love, war, etc. In this respect,
beth the speaker and the enter-
tainer are attempting the same thing,
and neither has accomplished his
goal if he fails to convey a message.
The speaker’s message is intellec-
tual, the entertainer’s sensuous.
The major difference between the
two is that the inspiration or sug-
gestion implanted by the speaker is
not resolved at the time of presen-
tation. It remains within the lisener’s
mind, fermenting and expanding.
The ideas contained in a particular
speech are evaluated by the intel-
ligent listener and either discarded
as worthless or retained as being of
some value.
Singer v. Speaker—Basic Difference
The basie difference, however,
seems to lie somewhere else. The
Negro was brought to this country
to fill a need, the need for slave
labor, to make operable the manorial
agricultural system which existed |

New English Studies

In last Tuesday’s edition of this
paper, it was announced that the
English department is offering a new
seminar course to study particular
authors intensively; this is an ex-
cellent idea and one in which the
English department acted in ac-
cordance with other departments.

Both the philosophy and psychol-
ogy departments are dropping their
courses in Directed Readings. Drs.
Hayner and Pemberton are offering
four brand-new courses next year:
Philos. 251-252 (Meaning and Exist-
ence) which will involve study of
the existentialist philosophers, Kant,
and the later dialogues of Plato; 255
(Seience and the Modern World);
256 (Philosophy and Literature): and
267-268 (Modern Philos.) in which
recent Continental, British, and
American philosophers will be stud-
ied.

Psychology Courses

Drs. Hinton and Jarrard have add-
ed a special course in Advanced
Psychology (Psych. 108) which will
relate behavior to physiological
characteristics and the nervous sys-
tem and will require lab work and
individual projects. This latter course
should be of special interest to ma-
jors and pre-meds.

Role As Musician, Not Speaker,
Is Where Negro Gets Pushed

By BILL KINSEY | arouse a response, to evoke an emo-

Sherman to inform the plantation
owner in no uncertain terms that he
would have to find some other way
to do things, the Negro was left with
no clearly defined position. He was
cast afloat with no place to go; and,
indeed, did not even know for what
he was supposed to be seeking. In
the wash of reconstruction years,
however, he fell back into what he
had been doing before the war, but
now for wages. And, in return for
his wages, he provided whatever
might be needed or demanded of
him.

It is this position tht we find the
Negro entertainer today. There is
a need for a commodity and he is
filling it; we have asked him to
entertain and we pay him well
when he does so. His is the position
of one supplying service, and, ‘there-
fore, he is no more nor no less than
a paid employee. However, with the
speaker it is different. His commod-
ity lies in the realm of ideas, goods
which are not easily subjected to
the rules of simple commerce. In
the case of most guest speakers,
payment is merely token; the prime
concern is with the free exchange of
ideas. But with the Negro speaker
we have the ease of one who pro-
offers something which is quite often
not desired. Because we have not
asked for it or experienced a need
for it, we feel that it is worthless or,
more than that, harmful. We do not
seek communication on such a high
level with the Negro. As far as
we are concerned, all his appeal is
to the senses and not to the intellect.
There is some vague fear that, if
all the things the Negro’s music
conveys were expressed in _ ideas,
which might catch hold, there would
be hell to pay.

Curious, isn’t it?

Robin Kell again figured largely

Generals Fight Back

Down by seven runs, the Generals
fought back with three in the fifth,
three i nthe sixth, and two more in
the ninth. Unfortunately, the Lynch-
burg eleven scored three in the
| seventh which proved to be the de-
| sivive margin. After the seventh,
| Chris Wigert relieved our ailing
pitcher and stopped Lynchburg in
their tracks. Nevertheless, the
| Generals couldn’t muster enough
runs to overcome their deficit.
W&L out-hit Lynchburg and col-
lected 10 runs to Lynchburg’s 12.
| Both teams had five errors. For the |
| Generals Sisler, Allen, Flanagan, |
Seda 9 Taylor, and Martin all had |
| two; one of Davis’ shots being 3!

one apiece, Rose’s being a four

the customs regulations will allow. And if by chance you should
run out of Marlboros in Europe, do not despair. That familiar
red and white Marlboro package is as omnirresent in Europe
as it is in all fifty of the United States. And it is the same
superb cigarette you find at home—the same pure white filter,
the same zestful, mellow blend of tobaccos preceding the filter.
This gem of the tobacconist’s art, this prodigy of cigarette
engineering, was achieved by Marlboro’s well-known research
team —Fred Softpack and Walter Fliptop—and I, for one, am
grateful.

But T digress. We were speaking of Franee—or the Serpent of
the Nile, as it is popularly termed.

Let us first briefly sum up the history of France. The nation
was discovered in 1066 by Madame Guillotine. There followed
a series of costly wars with Schleswig-Holstein, the Cleveland
Indians, and Jean Jacques Rousseau. Stability finally came to
this troubled land with the coronation of Marshal Foch, who
married Lorraine Alsace and had three children: Flopsy, Mopsy,
and Charlemagne. This later beeame known as the Petit Trianon.

Marshal Foch—or the Boy Orator of the Platte, as he was
affectionately called—was sueceeded by Napoleon, who intro-
duced shortness to France. Until Napoleon the French were
the tallest nation in Europe. After Napoleon most Frenchmen
were able to walk comfortably under card tables. This later
became known as the Hunchback of Notre Dame.

Napoleon, after his defeat by Credit Mobilier, was exiled to
Elba, where he made the famous statement, ‘‘Able was I ere I
saw Elba.” This sentence reads the same whether you spell it
forward or backward. You can also spell Marlboro backward —
Oroblram. Do not, however, try to smoke Marlboro backward
because that undoes all the pleasure of the finest cigarette made.

After Napoleon’s death the French people fell into a great fit
of melancholy, known as the Louisiana Purchase. For over a
century everyone sat around moping and refusing his food.
This torpor was not lifted until Eiffel built his famous tower,
whieh made everybody giggle so hard that today France is the
gayest ecoustry in Europe.

Each night the colorful natives gather at sidewalk cafes and
shout “Oo-la-la!’”’ as Maurice Chevalier promenades down the
Champs Elysees swinging his malacca cane. Then, tired but
happy, everyone goes to the Louvre for bowls of onion soup.

The principal industry of France is cashing travellers checks.

Well sir, | guess that’s all you need to know about France.
Next week we will visit the Land of the Midnight Sun—Spain.

© 1963 Max Shuiman
* * *

Next week, every week, the best cigarette you can buy the
whole world over is filter-tipped Marlboros—soft pack or
Flip-Top box—you get a lot to like.

broadeast from its own FM radio
station. An approximate $60,000 out-
lay will be needed to finance this
project.

For the many-faceted program, the
faculty in Journalism currently does

the best it can with improvised
quarters in three buildings. The
department has a “makeshift” city

room, no audio-visual room, only
partial broadcasting facilities, not
enough offices for the faculty, and
a lack of storage space.

The Department of Journalism
here was the first college level
instruction of its type offered any-
where in the world and was
founded by Robert E. Lee almost
100 years ago.

One of the relatively few de-
partments of its type to be fully
aecredited by the American Coun-
cil of Education for Journalism,
W&L is rated in competition with
the best and largest schools of Jour-
nalism throughout the country.

 

FREE CHEST X-RAYS

On May 7, free chest x-rays will
be given for university students
from 8:30 a.m. till 5:00 p.m. at the
dormitory parking lot. An x-ray
takes only a few seconds. Besides
detecting TB, a chest x-ray can
spot lung cancer and an enlarged
heart. In 1962, 90 per cent of the
new cases in Rockbridge County
were in an advanced stage. If de-
tected early, TB can be cured
quickly. There is no danger whatso-
ever from radiation in an x-ray.
It is recommended that a healthy
individual have one chest ?-ray a
year. Individuals who smoke should
especially plan to have an x-ray.

OLUME LXIII

Che KRing-tum Phi

By HARRY MEEM
SIPA Edition Editor

Two high school newspapers have been named co-
winners of this year’s Scholastic Press Award of the
Virginia Press Association.

The Anchor, of Floyd High School, and The County
Crier, of Floyd County High School, won the fifteenth
annual eward for their roles in a combining of three
high schools.

The citation, presented at the SIPA convention
luncheon in Doremus Gymnasium, praised The Anch-
or for “its effective role in preparing students and
community for the consolidation of three county
schools and for the excellent standards set by the new
school’s paper since the transition period.”

The new school’s paper, The County Crier, is co-
edited by Linda Nolen and Carol Page. The staff
is advised by Mrs. Ruth D. Hallman,

Another newspaper for a new school won the Wes!
Virginia Scholastic Press award, the seventh annual
presentation of the Charleston Press Club. The
Panther Press of DuPont High School, Belle, W. Va.,
was named winner of the award for its “bold new
approach through improved appearance and content,
its emphasis on definite objectives and its effective
editorials and art work.”

The Panther Press is edited by Connie Porter, with

Miss Jan Penix acting as adviser.
ist is Judy Wolfe.

The Wildcat, of New Hanover High School, Wil-
mington, N. C., the won Winston-Salem Journal and

MANAGED NEWS

One of the warmest fires currently roasting the New Fron-
tier is being used by the press and some of its critics who accuse
the Kennedy Administration of “managing” the news through
what, if some descriptions are accurate, are almost Gestapo
tactics. FBI men trailing reporters in the halls of the Pentagon,
Air Force investigating teams asking that Defense Department
officials submit to lie detector tests to find out who leaked
a memo, and other practices of this nature smack rather
strongly of a police state.

This is not the first Administration to manage the news.
Others have done so in the past, and we're sure it will be done
to some extent in the future. There’s really nothing to stop it,
no law says a government source must tell a reporter all he
knows, if he’s sure the reporter doesn’t know what's being held
back.

There are reasons for government secrecy in some things.
Such areas as defense specifications, missile qualities, and other
things which might help an enemy catch or surpass us in the
cold or a possible hot war are perfectly legitimate things to be
withheld.

The disturbing thing is the possibility that some officials
may be hiding, under the guise of security, their own incom-
petencies.

There are many ways to manage news, besides clamping a
“security”? heading down on it. This Administration is making
frequent use of its police powers to do the job. Federal agents
have visited the homes of reporters and other newspaper em-
ployees in attempts to question them about their sources. Some
reporters say they have been shadowed in the halls of the
Pentagon, and many believe their telephones to be tapped.

The Administration says the free-wheeling investigations
have been for the purpose of plugging security leaks. Hanson
Baldwin, writing on the subject in the April issue of The
Atlantic, points out that the stories which got into print have
in almost all cases been fully known to most foreign powers,
including the Russians. And, Baldwin adds, most of the stories
have embarrassed the Kennedys.

We can’t entirely absolve the press from blame for this
management of news. Too often, with governments becoming
more and more complex and spread out further, reporters are
contenting themselves with the handouts from public rela-
tions men or information officers, and not bothering to go
further, to check the story out to see how many grains of truth
it contains. They fail to do any work on their own, they prefer
to be spoonfed. To be sure, it’s hard to get a complete picture
when the elements are diffused, but some checking can be done.
As Baldwin says, “it is imperative that enterprising reporters
continue to break through the wall of secrecy around govern-
ment. When no leak occurs, I shall ll really begin to worry.”

A WORD OF THANKS

Running the Southern Interscholastic Press Association’s
annual meeting is something like putting out a daily newspaper.
The closer one gets to deadline time, the more panic sets in.

Most of our guests see things run, we hope, fairly smoothly.
There are occasional slips, to be sure, when name tags are lost
or speakers fail to appear in the right place at the right time.
But for the most part we try to keep our slips to ourselves, and
present an efficient-looking operation.

The man chiefly responsible for this is SIPA Executive Di-
rector John K. Jennings, by now a veteran of this event. He
is quite accustomed to planning programs, checking times,
and then having to fill in some place in case of accidents. To
him goes much of the credit, not only for the SIPA programs
which we hope you enjoyed, but for the radio shows described
elsewhere on this page. We hope some of you managed to
squeeze into our rather cramped quarters to observe them.

Another man to whom the Southern Interscholastic Press
Association can be grateful is our planner of short courses,
Associate Professor Paxton Davis of the Journalism Depart-
ment. Editor of the Sunday book page of the Roanoke Times,
he is also author of several books and numerous short stories.

To Professor O. W. Riegel, head of the Journalism Depart-
ment and a veteran of SIPA conventions since 1931, go thanks
for lining up the ‘three main speakers this weekend. And
there are always the people behind the scenes, the cogs in
our sometimes recalcitrant mechanism. Some of them you met
during registration (and wasn’t that hectic?), most of the rest
are listed in the staff box to the right.

Our last word of thanks, but far from the least, goes to
our print shop crew, the men who have to set what you've
been reading, make it up in page forms following frequently-
ridiculous instructions from the editor, and get it on the press
in time to distribute to you before you leave our campus. To
Superintendent C. Harold Lauck and his men; Linotype oper-
ator Lynwood Pullen, compositors Edward Backus and Edwin
Walker, and pressman Don Tabbut, our deepest thanks for
putting up with constant attempts to stretch a deadline, sloppy
writing, dirty copy, and our ingrained ability to make nuisances
of ourselves without really trying. Where we'd be without
them we don’t rightly know.

At any rate, SIPA is over for another year. We hope you
enjoyed it, and that some of you will come back next year for
another session. We’ll be expecting you.

“Good evening. This is Home Edi-
tion, your nightly news report from
the Washington and Lee Department
of Journalism and Communications.”

These words open, five nights a
week, a 15-minute news broadcast
assembled by the largest radio news
steff in the stste—Washington and
Lee’s Home Edition.

The broadeasts are a combination
of classroom laboratory and extra-
curricular activity. International,
national, state, local and sports news
are covered in the student broad-
easts .

Material for Home Edition comes
from the Associated Press teleprint-
er in the Journalism Department
newsroom, and from local copy
gathered by students in the depart-
ment’s reporting courses. Late-
breaking stories are covered by
ihe staff on duty.

On the air five nights a week,
Ilome Edition is often the first
source of local news, beating the
county weekly newspaper by sev-
cral days on a story. The W&L-
produced newscast is the last news
of the evening carried by radio
station WREL.

Local news is covered systemat-
ically on a series of “beats” which
include town and county govern-
mental offices, local, county and state
police headquarters, charitable or-

ganizations, Lexington’s two col-
leges, the five high schools in
the county, and local sports.

The copy thus produced is re-
written, as is the Associated Press
material, to produce a balanced pro-
gram consistent in form and style.
This is the job of the five nightly
staffs.

A typical night for the Home Edi-
tion staff finds the men on duty
reporting to the newsroom around
7:30 for work. Chances are the
senior editor for the evening has

writers for rewriting. The senior edi-

The night often includes scurrying
around for that last big story on a
local fire or accident, taping Radio

of the many prominent speakers
who come to Washington and Lee.

Election nights are among the
busiest for Home Edition. The show
is on the air from 8 p.m. to mid-
night or beyond, providing county
residents with the first news not only
of national and state elections but
the progress of any local races. One
reporter is stationed at the county
courthouse for returns coming in
there, and a large staff is assembled
to watch the wire service for tabula-
tions, write copy, and engineer the
show, in addition to the staff of
the regular 9:45 news show.

John Jennings

Again Directs
SIPA Activity

The massive task of handling the
organization of SIPA was conducted
by John K. Jennings, W&L assistant
professor in journalism and Execu-
tive Director of SIPA.

Once again this year, Jennings
held this important post—a_ position
which is a real year-round operation
since the planning for an SIPA con-
vention must stort as soon as the
previous year’s activity is finished.

As Jennings ean testify, the job is
often tedious one. He made the
first contacts with this year’s dele-
gates last November when 2,500
posteards were mailed to secondary
schools. The big mailing, however,
came in January when registration
forms, bulletins, and announcements
for the State Scholastic Press Asso-
ciation Awards were sent out.

a

Meanwhile, the Advisory Com-
mittee was corresponding and ex-
changing ideas. Several secretaries
handled the voluminous mail
which flowed into the journalism
department.

When the entry forms and pub-
lications arrived, they were clas-
sified and judged, and certificates
were prepared for the winners.

As time for the 34th annual con-
vention rolled around, Jennings was
a familiar figure slouched over his
desk, working to “beat the dead-
line.”

This marked the fourth year Jen-
nings has served as the Executive
Director. He also helped with the
convention when he was a student at
Washington and Lee.

A 1956 journalism graduate, Jen-
nings has worked with WDBJ-TV
in Roanoke and the Armed Forces
radio while he was in the Army.
Among his Armed Forces radio as-
signments were the Geneva nuclear
talks, the Brussels World’s Fair, an
interview with Khrushchev’s aide
Mikoyan, and the Council of Europe
meeting.

When a senior at W&L, Jennings
came up with a recording of Senator
Alben Barkley’s speech at the 1956
mock convention when Barkley col-
| lapsed and died while addressing the
student body. Jennings’ recording

With the success of another S.I.P.A. weekend, we take
this opportunity on behalf of the university to congratulate
the department of Journalism and express our appreciation for
an invaluable service to W&L. We take great pride in the
contribution such a program makes to our prestige among high

schools throughout the South.

The success of S.I.P.A. brings to mind the ideal setting
W&L offers for such conferences. We are fortunate to have
one of the most attractive campuses in this part of the country.
Conveniently linked with this asset is the fact that we have with-
in blocks of the campus adequate housing facilities to accommo-
date an amazingly large number of visitors. The ease with which
we could provide for 1000 students this past weekend is some
indication of our facility resources.

Such a setting presents a perfect opportunity to fulfill an
important need both in our university and in this section of
Virginia. First, we would be fulfilling a need for ourselves in
that, though we have a fine academic standing, there are many
who have formed a mistaken image of W&L. This is particu-
larly true of neighboring girls’ colleges which see W&L only

on the weekends and thus get a

Secondly, we would be fulfilling a need for this part of Vir-
ginia—a need for closer communications among the colleges
of the area. Several colleges have recognized this need and have
responded to it. Hollins for a number of years has been con-
ducting a literary frestival. It draws outstanding speakers and
there is a high degree of participation among colleges of west-

ern Virginia.

“his year, the students of Randolph-Macon Women’s Col-
lege won wide acclaim for themselves by initiating a conference,
“Focus,” dealing with American culture. Sweet Briar College
sponsored on the same weekend a conference on “Religion and
the Arts” which was likewise successful. In each case, the pres-
tige of the sponsoring college was enormously boosted.

It is foolish for us to let such an opportunity slip any long-
er. If we are at all interested in such a possibility, thought and
preparation ought to begin this spring. We above all solicit
the patronage of such departments as English, history, political
science, religion, and philosophy which might help the student
body by sponsoring such a program.

This investment would be too rewarding to bypass. We
appeal above all to the student body; for if this plan is ever to
be realized, the initiative must come from the students them-
selves. Keep in mind that there is an amazing potential for such
a program and we lose so much by not exploiting it.

Personality The New Unit
In Economy Of Exchange

By JOHN KIRKLEY

People today have forgotten how
to love. Indeed many of us have nev-
er learned what love is, for love is
an art which we have ceased to ap-
preciate, understand, and teach. This
is the thesis of Erich Fromm’s The
Art of Loving.

Americans today live in a modern,
industrialized, market economy based
on the principles of efficiency, pro-
duction, and consumption. This is our
environment; it is the basie reality,
the backdrop around which we shape
our intellectual, emotional, and pro-
ductive capacities. And we mold
our children to fit this market ma-
chine.

Man is a malleable animal; he
can attain heights of intellectual,
moral, emotional, sensual, and
spiritual exaltation, or he can
fall into the abyss of degradation.
What the individual actually does
is largely determined by the socie-
ty in which he lives and by the
attitudes and responses he learns
from those nearest him.

In a market economy, one pays
for what one gets; for $2.50 one can
get a tie or a steak dinner; one
used to be able to get a soft drink
for a nickel; for one’s labor one
gets paid. The principle is exchange.
To consume, one must get; to get
one must produce or offer what an-
other wants; the cycle is continu-
ous.

And we carry the exchange prin-
ciple over into our personal affairs.
There is a “personality market” just
as there is a labor market, a factor
market, and a product market. Cer-
tain qualities are required for cer-
tain jobs; the salesman needs a
smile, confidence, and a sincerity of
manner; the manager needs efficien-

ey and the ability to carry out
tasks himself and motivate those
under him to do the same.

In dating, rushing, making

friends, and courting, one offers
a “personality package” of what-
ever pleasing qualities he is able
to muster or develop or sham.
The empahsis in business, on the
football field, and during marriage
is on teamwork, efficiency, and the
attaining of goals. One must learn

 

to “carry the ball’ ‘or “do his

share.”

There is a necessity in a market
system for developing many kinds
of equality. Many people must do
dull, routinized work; for this they
are rewarded with money so that
they can “have fun.” But the dull-
ness of the work kills imagination
and aspiration and often results in
lethargy. Many persons in our econ-
omy are functionally interchange-
able; this is not true in dating and
often in marriage, as it is on the
assembly line.

A common misconception in our
culture today is that love consists
in “falling in love.” When the bar-
riers of isolation suddenly fall be-
tween two people, they often ex-
perience their escape from separate-
ness and superficial knowledge of

the other, especially if it is acom-'

panied by sexual satisfaction, as “be-
ing in love” which is, to them, a nec-
essary and sufficient condition for
marriage.

Erich Fromm feels that real
leve, a love which is deep and
meaningful, is more like “standing
in” love. It is enduring and last-
ing. The reason for this is that
real love is an art which must be
learned, acquired, as is any other
art. “Love is the active concern
for life and the growth of that
which we love.” The active charac-
ter of love requires care, respon-
sibility, respect, knowledge.

Love for others is impossible with-
out self-knowledge and_ self-love;
yet the idea of self-love is regarded
as perverted or sinful by many. It
is only in the full knowledge of
oneself and of one’s existential iso-
lation and aloneness that one can

choose, intellectually, rationally, to} ~

relate himself to others and to his
world through love and work in a
creatively enlarging manner.

Dr .Fromm discusses several forms
of love: brotherly love, which is
for all men; motherly love, which
is completely giving and unselfish;
erotic leve, which is distinguished
from mere sex and gratification and
which is particular, based on a full
knowledge and acecptance of the

‘Old George’ To Receive
New Coat For Spring

“Old George,” who had to sur-
vive the long, cold winter garbed in
a protective cloth, will get a well-
deserved spring coat in a few days.
The 120-year-old statute of George
Washington which is atop of Wash-
ington and Lee’s Washington Hall
has been an object of concern to
university officials.
His eight-foot, four inch frame
began to show signs of the beatings
he took from the elements, wood-
peckers and capricious students. Last
fall university maintenance men de-
cided George deserved more than
another paint job (he’s had at least
75 coats).

They removed several pieces of
rotting wood, filled his body with

him with chemicals intended to pre-
serve his finely-detailed features.
Tough Decision
But factors delayed fitting George
with a brand new overall coat—bad
weather set in and a tough decision
on the best outer coat had to be
made.
Good weather is finally here and,
after considering many possibilities,
the university has reached a deci-
sion.
George will get a coat of neo-
prene-hypalon, a synthetic rubber-
plastic material that can be sprayed

By BILL LOWRY

Sunday night, over two hundred
people—both students and _ towns-
people—heard a group of New York
teenagers, members of the Hudson
Guild Settlement House speak on
the subject of racial integration.
Many questions were raised, but
perhaps the most important one was
asked by the President of the Club,
who, during a brilliant speech
asked, “Why is your school segre-
gated?”

In a celebrated editorial which
has appeared in the Ring-tum Phi
for the past two years, a W&L pro-
fessor has asked whether or not we
have the right to change the Honor
System, the implication being that
because of the great value contained
therein. I should, therefore, like to
ask a similar question concerning the
racial question: do we have the right
to maintain Washington and Lee as
a segregated institution?

Legally, of course, we are com-
pletely within our rights, as a
private college, to do what we
please. But morally, I would ser-
iously question anyone who feels
that we, as a supposedly “Chris-
tain” institution with our high
aims of academic freedom, have a
right to perpetuate what is per-
haps the greatest blight on the
American ideal of democracy. The
harm which this evil does can be
seen in the reaction in other coun-
tries, in the situation at Oxford, in
the gang wars in East Harlem, and
in the appalling crime rates of
Washington, D.C.

The group from the Hudson Guild
made it quite clear that integration
is no easy matter; we all have
prejudices, economic, racial, and in-
tellectual, and to get anywhere we
must admit these prejudices in or-
der to come to know ourselves, and
we must all recognize that first to
admit our prejudices, and then to do
something about correcting them can
only come with great difficulty. At
the same time, however, as long as
Washington and Lee remains segre-
gated, we are depriving ourselves of
any contact with those who can
make us face up to these questions
of prejudice; consequently, every
student generation which leaves
Washington and Lee is unequipped
to cope with a situation which is
becoming more and more common—
that of the integrated society.

Let us not, then, support racial
integration because it is some great
cause, or because it will change
our “image” abroad, important
though these factors may be. Let
us, rather, support it because, by
maintaining our segregated stand-
dards, we are being deprived of
the very kind of knowledge the
university exists to provide—that
of ourselves and of the world
about us, In not being allowed to

Change In Student Attitude |
Is Concern Of New Officers

By BILL BOARDMAN

Vice-President of Student Body

Now that the battle of the student
bedy elections is over and the smoke
is beginning to
clear, this would
seem to be a good
to examine
some of the prob-
) lems with which
these newly elect-
ed officers will be
» dealing.

The honor sys-
tem at Washing-
ton and Lee is
doubtlessly the
school’s most val-
ued asset. Without such a system
W&L could not have attracted pro-
fessors of such high calibre, many
of whom would leave should it
ever be abolished.

Along this line it is well to ex-
amine the change which is overcom-
ing our campus. In the minds of
many, the election of the Progres-
sive Party candidates represents a
change. This could be a valid point,
but is such a change necessarily bad?

 

other races, we are being denied
a most fundamental right—that of |
knowing people, as they are, not |

them to be.

We must further recognize that.
integrating Washington and Lee |
will be no easy task. It is no secret
that much of our endowment is
based on segregationist money, and|
that, when integration occurs, Wash- |

ii

ington and Lee will stand to lose:

A Transitional Period
Washington and Lee although some |
two hundred years old is passing
through a transitional period. We
are beginning to gain the standards
of intellectual performance that a
student body and faculty such as
ours are capable of attaining. Many
members of the student body and
alumni are concerned W&L may be-
come a school for eggheads and
liberals. Yet all one needs to do
to be reassured this is not the long
range goal of our administration is
to confer on this subject with these
gentlemen. It seems to me that their
goal is to push Washington and Lee
to the highest intellectual level
while continuing to produce the
well-rounded liberal arts graduate.
In my opinion there is another
shift overtaking W&L which is of a
much more important nature than
this moderate one in academic stand-
ards.
Change in Attitude
The change to which I refer is a
change in attitude on the part of
the student body. Our faculty has
the ability to help us to become

Most important of all, however, is)

too can be done in Lexington right.

well educated men, but there is a
vast difference between a well edu-
cated man and a well educated
gentleman, At Washington and Lee,
however, there seem to be factions
which would let the valued tradi-
tions of gentlemanly conduct. slip
by the wayside. These people criti-
cize our honor system, contending it
is idealistic and does not fit in with
the modern American way of life.
They criticize our tradition of con-
ventional dress contending that no
one can dictate another’s appearance.
Four Short Years

In view of our transient stay of
four short years, what gives us the
right to tamper with the basic foun-
dations of these traditions which
have endured for so long a time?

It is this attitude change rather
than an academic one that challenges
the newly elected officers. They must
take a firm stand on issues to see
these traditions are preserved.

The student body officers for next
year are surely capable individuals
with the ability and desire to give
you an excellent year of student
government.

much of his support. At the same
time, however, we might well ask
ourselves how much money we
have lost by not being integrated.
Such a change in our policies would
indeed be a gamble, but a gamble
well worth taking, in the light of the
policies of such groups as the Ford
Foundation. If we are to be re-
sponsible students, we must insist
that Washington and Lee takes this
step.

In addition, there are many
things that we as students can do
to prepare the way. First, of
course, we can let the powers that
be know how we feel on the mat-
ter, by keeping the question alive.
Much interest has been generated
by the talk Sunday night, and it
would indeed be tragic to let this
interest wane.

Second, there is a large Negro
community in Lexington, all of

W&L Library Staff Plagued
With Flood Of Lost Articles

By WARREN MONTGOMERY

Every year at the close of school,
Miss Martha Cullipher, the Refer-
ence Librarian at McCormick Biblio-
theeary (an archaic term which is
more fitting for McCormick than the
modern word) is swamped with the
clothing, books, and other sundry
goodies that departing students have
dumped or lost there before leav-
ing for the summer. And every
year, she has tried to fight this sit-
uation by posting a notice on the
library bulletin board listing all
the lost items and, if labeled, their
owners.

This stategem has thus far been
ineffectual because, of course, the
average W&L student is so fascinat-
ed with his library research that
he never notices such superfluous
trivia as lost clothes or notices. This
year, therefore, Miss Cullipher has
taken her campaign to the pages of
the Ring-tum Phi, and the follow-
ing is an example of what she means.

Lost Shorts

In 1961, the lost included: 16

raincoats, a felt hat, 2 sweaters,

 

2 jackets, and a top coat. The fol-
low year, there were 5 rain coats,

|7 jackets, 5 sweaters, a top coat, a

pair of galoshes, a pair of socks,
6 unbmrellas, a brief case, a Ber-
muda straw bag, and one pair of
shorts! This year’s total is not yet
known, but it definitely includes
several umbrellas, two fairly decent
sport jackets, and a pair of pants.
(Incidentally, this writer, for one,
is interested in just how pairs of
trousers and shorts were lost in the
library. What is going on over there
anyway?) In addition, about 50
books are dumped in the library an-
nually at the end of the year.
Pertinent Remarks

There are two pertinent remarks
to be made about this problem.
The first is that there are probably
a lot of students running around
here who are needlessly suffering
exposure and/or a depleated ward-
robe. The second is that it was very
rainy in 1961 whereas 1962 was rela-
tively dry—a _ conclusion _ easily
reached upon examination of the
respective raincoat tabulations.

For those intellectuals who deplore
the shallowness of journalism, the
moral of this story will be drawn

Competition is tense in spring intramurals as year comes to end.

 

Lacrosse Team Succumbs, 13-4

The University of Baltimore
handed W&L a 13-4 loss yesterday.
Bad luck plagued the team from
the first minute when both Jay
Bowersox and Bruce Jackson were
injured and put out for the rest of
the game. The Stickmen held Bal-
timore to a 3-3 tie up to the half,
but Baltimore scored eight more
goals in the third quarter which
fairly well put the game out of
reach.

Generals Again Slaughter R.P.L.

By TOM CARPENTER
“oF. ly 2 LOU he ew
saying of the Washington and Lee |
baseball team as the Generals de- |
feated the Richmond club for the
second time this season here Friday
afternoon.

The Generals have won only three
games all year and two have been at
the expense of R.PI.

The hero of both games has been
Chris Wigert, southpaw sophomore
hurler, who is as efficient at the
plate as he is on the monnd. Wigert
was the winning pitcher in both
contests and in the more recent one
was the batting star.

Generals Score Seven |

The Generals wasted no time in
giving Wigert a lead as they came
through with seven runs in the first
frame. Eric Sisler started the rally
with a single, which was followed
by four errors on the next two bat-
ters accounting for two runs. Lou
Flanagan walked and Buck Rose
sacrificed. Howie Martin beat out
an infield hit to load the sacks.
Bob Taylor drew a free pass to
drive in another tally. Doug Davis
forced Flanagan at home for the
second out of the inning. Wigert
took three balls, and Coach Lyles
wisely had the take sign on. Wigert
ignored the sign and blasted a long
smash to right centerfield to clear
tne bases and give him a 7-0 mar-
gin to work with.

The winners added three more
runs in the sixth, after R.P.J. had
scored its first run on singles, by
Martin and Wigert, a double by
Sisler, and a single by Ashley Allen.

The visitors added two runs in

 

Cletis

   

 

the seventh, but the Generals got one
back on a walk to Rose, an error,
and a single by Davis.

The losers got their last three runs
in the eighth, while W&L also added
its last run in that inning on an
error, a forceout, and a double by
Flanagan.

For Wigert it was his third vic-| |

tory against a lone defeat. His five
RBI's also increased his team-lead-
ing total to 12. He also took over the
lead in the average department from

‘ Chuck Lane with a 429 mark. Lane

is hitting 390 after being shut out
for the first time this season.

The Generals were scheduled to. ith

play Camp Lejeune here yesterday, |
but were rained out. Tomorrow Old |
Dominion invades W&L for a game
scheduled for 3:15. Old Dominion
brings a 15-3 record into the game
and holds an 8-4 decision over the
Generals in an earlier game, which
was Wigert’s one defeat.

Debaters Win Four, Lose Four
In National Championships

In the National Debate Tourna-
ment held at West Point, N.Y.,
this past weekend, Washington and
Lee debators Bill Noell and Al
Eckes posted a record of four wins
and four losses.

Eckes and Noell’s showing was
not good enough to put them in the
final elimination rounds among the
top 16 teams of the 38 which were
present. They could be consoled,
however, by the fact that one of
the W&L victories came at the ex-
pense of Dartmouth, which went on
to win the tournament and thus
become national champions; and that
no Souther school finished with a
better record than Washington and
Lee.

The tournament was scheduled ac-

Futch To Speak
About Papacy

Dr. Jefferson Davis Futch, Assist-
ant Professor of History, will ad-
dress the International Relations
Club tonight, April 30, in duPont
Auditorium. The subject of Dr.
Futch’s lecture will be “Italy and the
Papacy in Post-War Europe.”

A new member of the faculty,
Dr. Futeh comes to Washington and
Lee from Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity where he received his AB in
General Humanities and his Ph.D. in
History. He spent two years in Italy
where he was able to do extensive
research in Italian political affairs.
Dr. Futeh is also a member of Phi
Beta Kappa and the Society for
Italian Historical Studies.

In his lecture, Dr. Futch will em-
phasize the foreign relations and
domestic politics of both the Italian
Republic and the Papacy since 1945.
He will also consider the relations
between these two governments.

The lecture will be held at 7:15
p.m. and the public is invited.

entire being of another; self-love,
which is the sine qua non of all
love; and the love of God, which
is really aceording to the Hindus,
the love of One, of each particular
individual as himself and also as
all men, the understanding of per-
fection and the divine in the self, in
others, and the material world.

The principle of love and _ the
principle of a capitalistic market
system are incompatible; yet it is
posible for individuals to maintain
their functional integrity within our
economic system and _ still become
loving, creative persons.

cording to the power match prin-
ciple, according to which the top-
seeded teams meet each other im-
mediately, and the winning teams
are rematched against each other.
The W&L pair, who won three and
lost only one on the first day,
therefore had to face the tourney’s
strongest teams on the second day.
In this competition, easily the
stiffest of their careers, Noell and
Eckes lost three of the last four de-
bates.

They scored wins over Dartmouth,
Army, Kansas State, and the Uni-
versity of Kansas. Losses were at the
hands of St. Olaf, Boston College,
Wayne State, and Iillinois State.
The University of Virginia won
three and lost five contests at the
meet.

Debate director William Chaffin
called the tournament the best effort
he has seen from a Washington and
Lee team. It was the first W&L
appearance ever at the national
championships, a visit which was
earned when Noell and Eckes placed
second in the middle Atlantic elimi-
nation tournament last month.

 

The Student Service Society held
elections for next year’s officers last
Tuesday night, April 22. The pur-
pose of this organization is to show
visitors and prospective students
around the campus of Washington
and Lee. Chosen as officers for next
year were Ken Lane as President,
Jim Watlenstein as Vice President,
and Dick Kreitler as Secretary.

Ken Lane, apart from his services
on the SSS, will be editor of the
Friday edition of the Ring-tum Phi
for 1964-64 .Throughout his years at
W&L he has consistently been on
the Dean's List. He is an active
member of the University Christian
Association, and has served as a
Freshman Dormitory Counselor this
year.

Nine New York

A group of nine New York City
teenagers discussed the problems
of racial prejudice Sunday evening
in the parish hall of the R. E. Lee
Memorial Church, before a capacity
audience of students and towns-
people. The discussion was spon-
sored by ReVue and the Washington
and Lee Department of Sociology.

The Interemeler Club of the Hud-
son Guild Neighborhood House,
which presented the program, is an
integrated group of high school and
college students from the Chelsea
section of New York City.

The Club was formed eight months
ago for the purpose of erasing racial
and ethnic prejudice prevalent in
Chelsea through interracial dialogue
and personal contact.

Peter Zelin, a nineteen-year-old
freshman at Long Island University
and President of the Club, urged
those present to overcome their
prejudices by attempting “to know
people as people, and not as stereo-
types.”

A suggestion by Mr. Zelin to the
effect that students at Washington
and Lee and VMI might be “memor-
izing more than really learning and
understanding the democratic prin-
ciples upon which America is sup-
posedly founded” was warmly re-
ceived by the audience.

A question and answer period
followed Mr. Zelin’s talk in which
such issues as intermarriage, pri-
vate property rights, and the rela-
tive merits of gradualism as opposed
to immediate social change were
discussed .

The Club was brought to Lexing-
ton through the efforts of Miss Kath-
erine Dunham, a well-known chore-
ographer and author, and by Jay
Taylor, instructor in Romance Lan-
guage at Washington and Lee and

you can lose, you should reckon of
no account” (Publilius Syrus, Max-
im 184, 42 B.C.). Finally, if you are
neither literary nor casual, Miss
Cullipher says that this year, all ef-
fects deposited in the library at the
end of the year will be “disposed
of,” so if you are missing a pair of
pants, you’d better go to the library
right away and claim them.

THE CURSE OF TIIE CAMPUS: NO. 2

As was pointed out last week, one would think that with all
the progress we have made in the education game, something
might have been done by now about roommates. But no. The
roommate picture has not brightened one bit since Ethan
Goodpimple founded the first American college.

(Contrary to popular belief, Harvard was not the first. Mr.
Goodpimple started his institution some 75 years earlier. And
quite an institution it was, let me tell you! Mr. Goodpimple
built schools of liberal arts, fine arts, dentistry, and tanning.
He built a lacrosse stadium that seated 102,000. Everywhere
on campus was emblazoned the stirring Latin motto CAVE
MUSSI—“Watch out for moose.” The student union contained
a bowling alley, a clock, and a 16-chair barber shop.

(It was this last feature—the barber shop—that, alas,
brought Mr. Goodpimple’s college to an early end. The student
body, — from the nearby countryside, was

com

equots and Iroquois who, alas, had no 7.
barber shop. They braid their hair instead of cutting it, and as
for shaving, they don’t. The barber, Tremblatt Follicle by name,
grew so depressed staring all the time at 16 empty chairs that
one day his mind finally gave way. Seizing his vibrator, he ran
outside and shook the entire campus till it crumbled to dust.
This later became known as Pickett’s Charge.)

But I digress. We were discussing ways for you and your
roommate to stop hating each other. This is admittedly diffi-
cult but not impossible if you will both bend a bit, give a little.

I remember, for example, my own college days (Berlitz, ’08).
My roommate was, I think you will allow, even less agreeab!
than most. He was a Tibetan named Ringading whose native
customs, while indisputably colorful, were not entirely endear-
ing. Mark you, I didn’t mind so much the gong he struck on
the hour or the string of firecrackers he set off on the half-hour.
I didn’t even mind his singeing chicken feathers every dusk and
daybreak. What I did mind was that he singed them in my hat.

To be fair, he was not totally taken with some of m
either—especially my hobby of collecting water. I h
at the time and just had to stack the water any-old-where.

Well sir, things grew steadily cooler between Ringading and
me, and they might have gotten actually ugly had we not each
happened to receive a package from home one day. anes
opened his package, paused, smiled shyly at me, and offe

bits
no jars

“Thank you,” I said. “What is it?”
“Yak butter,” he said. ‘You put it in your hair. In Tibetan

“Well now, that’s mighty friendly,” I said and offered him a
gift from my package. “Now you must have one of mine.”

“Thank you,” he said. “What is this ealled?”’

“Marlboro Cigarettes,” I said and held a mateh for him.

He puffed. “Wow !” he said. “This sure beats chicken feathers!”

“Or anything else you could name,” I said, lighting my own

And as we sat together and enjoyed that fine flavorful
Marlboro tobacco, that pure white Marlboro filter, a glow of
good fellowship came over us—a serene conviction that no
quarrels exist between men that will not yield to the warmth of
honest good will. Iam proud to say that Ringading and I re-
main friends to this day, and we exchange eards each Christmas
and each Fourth of July, firecrackers.

Graduates
Come Today

For Reunion

By CHARLES NEWMAN

This afternoon marked the
rival of many former students of
Washington and Lee who are re-
turning for Alumni Weekend. There
will be reunions of the classes of
1913, 1925, 1938, 1953, from both
the University and the Law School.
Many activties have been planned
for the alumni in order that they
will have an enjoyable weekend.

are

Friday's schedule of events is a
busy one, as is Saturday's. Regis-
tration of the reunion classes began
at 2:00 today, and President and
Mrs. Fred C. Cole held a reception
for the returning graduates from
4:30 to 5:30 at the President’s home.

Tonight at 8:00 in duPont Audi-
torium, Colgate W. Darden, Jr., will
deliver the first of the 15th annual
Randolph Tucker Law lectures. Mr.
Darden a former governor of
Virginia. He was also president of
the University of Virginia from 1947
to 1959. His topic tonight will be:
“Random Thoughts on Government.”

Gov. Darden will speak again
Saturday afternoon when he will de-
liver the second of the Tucker Lec-
tures. There will be an open house
for all alumni and guests held by
the School of Law. This will take
place at 9:15 Friday, following the
first Tucker Lecture. This year is
the second time that the Tucker
Lectures and W&L’s Law Day have
been scheduled to coincide with
spring alumni activities.

Saturday promises to be even
busier with registration in the
morning, tours of the campus, and
visits to classes and with faculty
members. A coffee will be held at
the President’s home at 10:30. Then
there will be the second Tucker
Lecture.

At 1:15 a luncheon for all alumni
will be held in Evans Dining Hall.
President Cole will preside and
take part in a report on the “State
of the University,” in which he will
be assisted by the deans of the Uni-
versity and by the president of the
student body.

For the sports minded alumni,
there will be a tennis match at 2:30

~ NOTICES

On Tuesday, May 7, free chest
x-rays will be given in the Dor-
mitory Parking lot in front of
Reid Hall frem 8:30 to 5:00. These
x-rays will take only a few sec-
onds and may mean the difference
between life and death. Chest
x-rays not only detect Tubercu-
losis, but also lung cancer and
enlarged heart. There is absolutely
no danger from the small dose of
radiation.

Doctors recommend that a
healthy invidivual receive one
x-ray a year. If detected early,
TB and lung cancer can be cured
relatively quickly. The trouble is
that most cases are not detected
until the disease is in an advanced
stage. The students and members
of the faculty who smoke should
be sure to take advantage of this
opportunity.

Mahan Winners

 

Announced By |
Dr. Duvall |

The winners of the George A. Ma- |
han Awards for Creative Writing |
were announced today by Professor |

Duvall, head of the English De- |
partmen. |
Four awards were presented in|

all: two for junior prose, and one;
each for poetry. |

The winner of the freshman award
was Tony Outhwaite for short
story entitled “The Finished Pro- |
duct.” Dr. Duvall describes the |
story as “A cynical reverie by
graduating senior of his four hypo- |
critical and wasted years.”

Sam Ansell won the sophomore
award for “Old Paul Was My Best
Friend,” which Dr. Duvall calls “A
vingette revealing an indebtedness
to idiom and tone, especially recall-
ing Sallinger’s Holden Caufield.”

The two junior awards were won
by Bill Kinsey and Paul F. Van
Avery. Kinsey's story “The Birthday
Gift” is described as “having a con-
trol of idiom and structure that
suggests Reynolds Price.” Van
Avery's story “Moira” is described
by Dr. Duvall as “a first person nar-
rative of a love story “between a
water nymph and a fisherman.”

“There no award for poetry
beeause the entries in that category
were dissappointing,“ says Dr. Du-
vall; “on the other hand, the junior
prose division extremely dif-
ficult to judge beeause there were
so many good ones. Overall, we were
encourged by the number of entries
but would hope they would increase
in the future. I frankly enjoyed
reading them. I hope that there is
an increase in serious writing on the
campus.”

year following their presentation or

Candidates Stress Honor System
s Primary Issue Of Campaign

By MIKE HASH

Although many members of the
student body may feel that the
class elections to be held on Mon-
day evening are based primarily on
personalities, a pole of the candidates
running for E.C. positions has re-
vealed significant issues. In order
that the student body might have
an opportunity to view the opinions
of these candidates, they were each
asked to submit a statement con-
cerning the role of an E.C. commit-
teeman.

Jim Sylvester, Kappa Sigma and
Progressive Party candidate for sen-
ior class E.C. position, expressed the
following opinions: In regard to the
Honor System Sylvester feels that
it is the responsibilty of the E.C. to
continually reinterpret the ideal of

honor for the benefit of the students,

ductions. The student directors view
their efforts as a challenging exper-
ience finding satisfaction working
with their casts of young actors.
The work of the directors however,
does not lie solely in the direction
of their casts. They are also respon-
sible for their own sets, costumes,
and make-up.

Season ticket holders should make
reservations for each bill on their
ticket. For reservations call HO 3-

Famed Mnwie Critic MacDonald
To Speak On Current Cinema

By TOM PACE

Dwight MacDonald, one of Amer-
ica’s finest literary and film critics,
will be at Washington and Lee on
Monday, May 6. He will talk at
8:15 p.m. in duPont Hall on the sub-
ject, “The Cinema Today: Avant-
Garde and Rear Guard.” He is ex-
pected in his talk to touch on films
of varied quality from several dif-
ferent countries. Mr. Taylor’s ReVue
society sponsoring this lecture.

Mr. McDonald is the film critic
for Esquire magazine. Before going
there, he was a regular writer for
The New Yorker. He also writes,
with a degree of regularity, for
Film Quarterly, the finest publica-
tion of its kind in America, and
Commentary and Artisan Review,
which is also a highly respected lit-
erary journalism of criticism. He is
a graduate of Yale University (1928).

in the United is par-

‘ ticularly noted for being clever, per-

controversial nature which makes
him a promising, attractive speaker.

In 1948, he wrote Henry Wallace:

Awarding to Arthur Schlesinger, it
was “a brilliant slashing attack with

involved in the most interesting
literary quarrel of the year. His
quarrel was with James Gould Coz-

Possessed. Primarily because of Mr.
MacDonald’s bitter review, this novel
was brought down from its faslely
acquired heights. Newsweek report-
ed this quarrel, and described Mac-
Donald writer of great zest
and polemic skill, and a past master
of comic ridicule.”

In the last four years, Mr. Mac-
Donald has quarreled with many
other film erities concerning many
films. At the very least, Mr. Mac-

Donald promises to be an interest-

and to especially assimilate the
freshmen into the true spirit of the
Honor System. An attempt should
be made to remove fear as a_ basis
of respect for the Honor System.
Finally, the emphasis on the tradi-

tions of the University must be
maintained, but with a greater
amount of liberality rather than
force.

Syd Butler, SAE and Progressive
Party candidate for senior class
E.C. post, is concerned with keep-
ing the student bedy interested in
elections. He hopes that the voters
will become familiar with the quali-
fications of all the nominees, and at
the same time be aware of his ability
and earnest desire to serve the
student body as a member of the

E.C.

Buck Ogilvie, Beta and U.P. nom-
| inee for senior E.C. ecommitteeman
| supports the platform of the recently
‘elected student body officers with a
single addition. He would like to see
a mock honor trial held for the
purpose of acquainting the students
with honor trial procedures. Ogilvie
feels that his previous experience
on the E.C. would enable him to be
a valuable guide to the new mem-
bers of the E.C.

 

Candidates for the junior class rep-
resentative to the E.C. include Lamar
Lamb, a _non-fraternity student,
Skipper Chase, KA, Malcolm Mor-
ris, SPE, and Larry Manning, Beta.
Lamb has proposed a change in the
Honor System which was presented
to students in a circular. Coneern-
ing this change, Lamb issued the
following statement, “The views ex-
pressed in this proposal are mine and

 

not necessarily those of the other
candidates or my party.”

Skipper Chase, U.P. candidate, in-
tends to express his views personal-
ly as a part of his campaign. Mal-
colm Morris, Progressive Party nom-
inee, made the following comment
on the Honor System: “I feel that
the student body needs a more ex-
act definition of the boundaries of
honor system applicability. I am in
favor of a mock honor trial for all
students and much more intense as-
similation for freshmen into the
honor system,

Larry Manning, U.P. Candidate,
expressed this view on the Honor
System: “As a member of the stu-
dent body of Washington and Lee
and a candidate for an E.C. position,
I feel that the Honor System should
be maintained as it is. The strength
of Washington and Lee lies in the
Honor System and to weaken that
System in any way would certainly
weaken Washington and Lee.”

Chuck Walker, Kappa Sigma and
P.P. candidate for sophomore rep-
resentative to the E.C., is trying to
meet as many people as possible so
that he will be more than a name on
a campaign poster. He stressed his
particular interest in the proposed
student-faculty forum, and his de-
sire to introduce the Honor System
to freshmen in greater detail.

Gareth Aden, KA and U.P. nomi-
nee for sophomore representative to
the E.C., considers student-faculty
relations most important. Aden con-
tinues, “I realize the great respon-
sibilities of holding an E.C. position,
and if elected I will do my best not
to abuse this responsibility.”

An Endorsement

The following editorial, while it may be controver-
sial, is the conviction of the new staff of this paper, and

it is intended to encourage remarks on the subject.

Yesterday a candidate for next year’s Executive Com-
mittee issued a sheet in which he advocated a change in the
penalty levied for an Honor System violation. The candidate
has proposed that the present absolute expulsion regulation
be replaced with automatic expulsion for a year, with violator
subject to re-entry upon review of his case by the Executive
Committee.

The Friday Ring-tum Phi wholeheartedly endorses the pro-
posed change as a real step forward in the betterment of the
Honor System for several reasons:

First of all, it seems inconsistent that in a University dedi-
cated to the Christian ideal, a student guilty of a single indis-
cretion should be banned without a chance for either forgive-
ness or rehabilitation. What the “no second chance’’ penalty
says, in effect, is that the convicted violator is permanently
and irrevocably dishonorable. This appears to be the implicit
claim in the permanency of the present penalty. Obviously,
forgiveness is a fundamental element in the compasisonate
Christian Ideal. Our University supports this ideal, while equal-
ly supporting a system which not only precludes forgiveness
but also necessitates a very un-Christian kind of retribution.

Secondly, we sincerely feel that the Honor System exists
FOR the students, not the students for the system. While surely
we do support the Honor System, we abhor the very real
practical and psychological damage that it can do to a basically
honest individual.

If the additon of a bit of compassion will weaken the sys-
tem, then perhaps it needs “‘weakening.”’ We feel, however that
rather than weaken the system, the proposed innovation would
strengthen it in that it would alleviate much of the growing
doubt among students as to its unrealistic austerity. No one can
deny that there has been considerable criticism by students of
the present penalty—and this criticism may well reflect a basic
dissatisfaction in the system.

An argument that has been used to justify the present
penalty is that it “teaches a boy he can’t cheat his way through
life,” and brings about an essential improvement in a person’s
character. If this be the case, then why isn’t the violator given
the opportunity to prove that he can be “‘changed’’?

We should like to make one final point: according to the
sheet proposing the change, the present penalty was insti-
tuted only thirty years ago, while the Honor System had been
working perfectly well for nearly 100 years without it. This
indicates that expulsion is in no way an essential component of
the Washington and Lee Honor System and that the system
can operate quite successfully without it. 2s

On Party Ties

The Progressive Party was founded, allegedly, on the
principle that it would offer the best candidates from the party
for each office during the school year. The University Party
claims that it, too, works under this principle. We do not ques-
tion the sincerity of either party’s choices of major offices,
although it does seem that a rather select circle of fraternities
are continuing to dominate caucus decisions.

It could be argued that the new political system still con-
tains the old political dealing, but with a new suit of clothes.
We do not wish to do that at this time. What is of immediate
importance is not how the candidates were chosen, but what
they actually will do for the student if they are elected.

Many people do not realize that once a man is elected to be
a member of the Executive Committee, there is no way that his
opinions and the decisions of the EC can be checked by other
students. Policy decisions which concern the entire student
body are made by a dozen students who were elected once and
who either don’t have to worry about another election; or who
don’t have to worry about the rest of the student body knowing
what kind of job they are doing.

Because the EC has such absolute power, with no system of
checks and balances administered by other students, we feel
that party ties in themselves should not influence a student’s
vote in any way. Let us select our EC representatives and class
presidents for next year on the basis of their personal quali-
fications, their apparent sincerity, and the time they will have
to devote to the job for which they are running. The authority
which they gain is too great to allow it to be derived from
ancaleteaed votes aw. F.

The New ‘Gah

The culmination of months of careful photography, re-
writing, and preparation of new layouts was seen this week in
the release of the new University catalogue. Frank Parsons did
a highly commendable job on it. He faced many problems in
fashioning a catalogue so radically different from what has
been published in the past. They have been met with an in-
genuity and a competence that is very praiseworthy.

Parsons’ use of larger type in general, and a greater variety
of type, plus his imaginative use of pictures, produced for
Washington and Lee a catalogue which gives full justice to the
quality of the University. It will be a valuable tool for the Dean
of Admissions, and it is a source of pride to all those affiliated

By Feature Staff Writer

(Editor’s note—This is the third
in a series of articles to acquaint
the student body with the profes-
sors they see in class and around
the campus but never get to know.
One of the aims of a small col-
lege is to allow for closer contact
between the students and the fac-
ulty, and it is in the spirit of im-
proving this relationship that these
articles are offered.)

No one needs the picture to re-
mind them who Dr. Leyburn is. If
you have not had one of his courses,
you have heard about him, or at

haired, mannerly gentleman is the
author of four books; once taught
at Hollins; has lived in Haiti and
Africa; was once Dean of the Uni-
versity here; or that he is a con-
cert pianist?

Dr. Leyburn graduated from what
is now Duke University (formerly
Trinity College) in three years with
a degree in Economics. He was
eighteen when he graduated, and
stayed near to get his Master’s be-
fore going to Princeton. He received
his second Masters in Economics at
the age of twenty.

Transition Or Tradition?

Dear Editor,

I am writing in regards to an
article by Bill Boardman that ap
peared in Tuesday’s Ring-tum Phi.
Although by his own admission, Mr.
Boardman’s article didn’t say any-
thing, the tone of the article was
one that disturbed me greatly. His
article surely cannot reveal the real
attitude of someone of his intelli-
gence and position.

Of course Mr. Boardman’s per-
ception in noting W&L’s “period of
transition” must be commended, but
his fears of the entrance of “egg-
heads and liberals” cannot be gen-
uine. Surely he must realize that
eggheads—and yes,
are not really interested in destroy-
ing some of the “valued traditions”
of Washington and Lee, but rather
interested in looking at these values
in terms of their own merit rather
than merely accepting them because
they are old.

Again, it was hard to interpret just
what Mr. Boardman meant by

duet,” but I assume he meant a
degree of maturity as manifest in
interpersonal behavior. Here I need
only mention that
of W&L agree that the last few
years have seen a tremendous ma-
turation in the general student.
But the most unfortunate attitu-
tude expressed by Mr. Boardman
was that of tradition worship, Al-

Why Do Students Drink?
For Status, Not Escape

At one time college men took their
drinking seriously, but today they
no longer drink to get drunk.

That’s the word from Dr. Byron
Atkinson, dean of students, and
Dr. A. T. Brugger, dean of men,
at the University of California, Los
Angeles.

The educators say the modern
student considers drinking a so-
cial grace.

Fraternity drunks are tolerated
but not admired. This fact is an
indication of the “growing maturity
of a more affluent middle class.”

A survey conducted by the deans
reveals:

The shift in how and why students
drink occurred in 1948. It has be-
come a firm social pattern, especially
among residents of urban colleges.

The drinking habits of today’s
college crop are more consistent
with a mature attitude toward life
and learning.

The deans believe present-day
students don’t drink out of self-
pity as their predecessors did. If
they are insecure or worried, they
find answers in evangelical move-
ments or psychotherapy rather
rather than the bottle.

Why do they drink? They im-
bibe for conviviality, relaxation, and
to remove inhibitions and not for
comfort, escape, or exhibitionism.

Students don’t consider themselves
“angry young men” or members of
the “beat generation.”

They are not revolting against
patterns valued by adults because
they value these same _ patterns

It is high time that something is

should be implemented immediately.
The gradual erasure of the real
deep-seated prejudices in the minds

when contact between the races is
established, by force of law if neces-
sary. This erasure is what has to
come and can only come gradually.
It will come eventually, however,
whether diehards like it or not. The
students and their government
should take the lead to bring about
integration of university and town
now.

Crothers Reviews Golf , Net Week;
Both Teams Hampered By Rains

In the past week the General's |
tennis team has had matehes with
George Washington University and

3ridgewater College, losing in both
outings to rainy weather.

Enough of the mateh with George
Washington was played to find the
Generals losing, 742-1!4 before the
rain stopped the first doubles match
with the set split, 4-6,6-1. The only
Washington and Lee victory came
when Captain John Baker downed
Jerry Reedy, 7-5, 6-4 in a singles
match.

At Bridgewater on April 30, the
Generals managed to overcome the
Eagles, 5-0, before the rain again
canceled the action. Washington and
Lee handily won the five singles
matches played and Howard Busse
was leading his match, 6-0, 3-1 when
play was stopped.

Jackets Beat B-Lacrossemen

By ROGER SENNOT

The W&L JV stickmen dropped a
close 4-2 decision to visiting Ran-
dolph-Macon Lacrosse Club yester-
day afternoon. In what could be de-
seribed as a defensive battle, R-M’s
goalie John Gerhardt collected sev-
enteen saves and found open men
with uncanny accuracy on clearing
plays. His fine defensive effort en-
abled the visiting stickmen to keep
the pressure on W&L’s two goalies,
“Dusty” Rhodes and “Butch” West,
who did a fine job for the Generals.

At the end of the first half, the
affair was deadlocked, 1-1. Mid-
fielder Harry Brooky fired a hard

shot past "Macon’s goalie in the first
period, and the visitors picked up a
goal in the second frame to even
up the contest. The Generals were
often a man short during the first
half due to numerous penalties.
With a one man and two man ad-

| vantage during the second period,

R-M deluged the home team’s goal
tender (Rhodes) with shots which
he handled well by saving or de-
flecting away from the nets.

In the third quarter, midfielder
Jamie Andrew of the junior Gen-
erals alertly scooped up a loose ball
in front of ’Macon’s goal and flipped
it in. This was the only score of the
third frame, giving the Generals a
2-1 lead going into the final period.
In the fourth quarter, R-M’s stick-
men rallied for three goals to wrap
up the contest, 4-2. "Macon scored
the go-ahead goal when they inter-
cepted a pass by West almost direct-

ly in front of the Generals’ goal;
and quickly converted it into the

decisive tally. W&L had an oppor-
tunity to even the battle when with
two minutes left they had a one
man advantage, but failed. The jun-
ior * Generals now have a 1-3 recor rd.

State Meet Title

By DON CASTO

Assistant Sports Editor

The General thinclads romped to
an easy victory last Monday
noon, scoring ninety-eight
in a triangular meet against Elon
and Carolina College. Elon
finished with twenty nine points and
East Carolina with thirty-eight.

Hurdler John Pearson and jump-
er Robin Kell led the cindermen in
their victory. Pearson tallied wins in
the high and intermediate hurdles,
running thehighs in 16.4 seconds and
the 330 intermediates in

inches and the triple jump with a
bound of forty-five feet, two inches.

The mile run was won by soph-
omore Andy Kilpatrick in a time of
four minutes, forty-two and a half
seconds with freshman distance run-
ner Lee Johnson running a close sec-
ond. Mac Brownlee turned in his
usual outstanding performance and
won the 880 yard run with a time
of two minutes, two and four tenths
seconds .

Henry Sackett and Tom Edwards*

captured first and second in the
broad jump. The winning jump was
twenty feet and five inches. Sackett,
who had just recovered from :
pulled muscle also placed second in
the triple jump. In other field events
Dave Munroe took second in the
shot put followed by Dan Manson.

Dave Britt placed second in the
discus throw, and Sam Pipes was
third. Sprinters Mark Owen and
Wayne Barnes captured  seeond
places in the 100 and 220 dashes
respectively.

Last Saturday the track team

placed second in a field of fifteen
in the Davidson Relays. They missed
first place by the narrow margin of
two points. Coach Lord promises a
first place next year. The sprint
medley relay, anchored by Mac
Brownlee, achieved first place laur-

With the spring sport season
drawing to a close, let’s look for a
minute at the records compiled so
far by W&L teams.

fared well and now own a 3-2 ledg-

Eight Intelligent W&L Adbetes,
Sigma Delta Psi Receive Laudits

By DAVID SHUFFLEBARGER

Now what’s all this phooey about
dumb athletes? One sometimes gets
that impression after seeing some
of the teams who come to the campus
for games, meets or matches, and
bring with them subsidized athletes.
In some cases, the image is one
well-deserved, for the academic
standards for athletes at many larger
schools are definitely quite low. But
here at W&L, which has the hardest
entrance requirements in Virginia,
there is no such thing as the dumb
athlete.

Granted in the pre-1954 era there
was much subsidization at W&L.
But after several football players
were caught cheating, the adminis-

and Moore

tration decided, and rightfully so,
that the subsidized athlete was defi-
nitely lowering the standards of the

Honor Roll. In the freshman class,
Moore and Kennedy the presidential
candidates both made the Dean’s

country as a freshman, and Moore
was co-captain of the basketball
team. In the EC race, Aden plays
tennis and made the Dean’s list,
while his opponent Walker made
Phi Eta Sigma while running cross-
country and track.

To turn now to a little different
subject, I think it might be a good
idea if more people were required to
try out for Sigma Delta Psi. This na-
tional athletic fraternity a lot
more select than most of the social

fraternities here on campus. It pro-|

motes the healthy type of attitude
toward athletics that the staff here
at W&L advocates. Anyone interest-
ed in joining should see Coach Buck
Leslie in the Doremus Gymnasium.
Tryouts are being held until May
16. Anyone in Sigma Delta Psi al-
ready can act as judge for someone
trying to pass the tests, and once a
person passes the tests, if he turns
them in, he won’t have to pass them

 

 

 

story that follows is one that should
be well known by every student who
is interested in his school, and cul-
minates in the fine teams being pro-
duced today by our excellent phy-
sical education staff.

I-M Softball Finals

By virtue of their 6-2 victory
over the PiKA’s, the Delts intra-
mural softball team earned the right
to host the SPE’s in the finals of
the I-M Softball playoffs today.

Each of the teams, Delts, SPE’s,
Kappa Sigs, and the PiKA’s won
their respective league titles, giving
them a berth in the playoffs. The
Delts are undefeated, having also
topped the Kappa Sigs. The SPE’s
beat the PiKA’s for the finals of the
round robin affair.

If the SPE’s should win today, one
more game would be necessary to
decide the championship. Head um-
pire Pit Burton has not yet sched-
uled the extra game.

 

NOTICE

All Sigma Delta Psi entrants are
reminded that testing began yester-
day, and will continue through May

I believe that Mr. Lamb is ignoring
the basic purpose of our Honor Sys-

of this year’s Executive Committee
and the following purpose was out-
lined to me It is generally agreed
that the purpose of our Honor Sys-
tem is not to punish these persons
who breach our Honor System, but
instead its objective is to rid our
campus of these persons who can-
not live by the code of honor to
which they have consented by their
attendance at Washington and Lee.
With this basic purpose in mind,
the plan which Mr. Lamb outlines
sems to degeate the premise, upon
which our Honor System is based.

I feel that the Honor System must
not be weakened. As a member of

I would consider it my responsibility
to protect our Honor System, which
has made Washington and Lee

Mr. Lamb contends that since we
are a Christian institution, we must
continue to turn our cheek to those
who commit honor violations. This
proposal can only lead to disrespect
for our Honor System. We must be
realistic. Would not some persons
take advantage of Mr. Lamb’s pro-
posal and as an end result ruin our
Honor System? Persons would find
themselves weighing the advantages
and disadvantages or breaching the
Honor System, asking themselves if
a breach were worth a suspension.

Commenting his new duties, |
Mr. Schneider said he is looking|
forward to the Cambridge job “with |
a great deal of anticipation. But at |

ESQUIRE Film Critic MacDonald

Speaks Of Cinema Renaissance

Dwight MacDonald, famed Amer-

film critic for Esquire and a staff
writer for The New Yorker, spoke
on “The Cinema Today: Avant-
Garde and Rear Guard.”

In his talk, Mr. MacDonald stated
that the cinema is most interesting
form of art. To him, the theater, in
America and Europe, is of no inter-

est. As a basis for this belief, he
said he has seen many movies more
than once, but that there is yet a

The talk ended with a discussion
of American and European films. In
Europe films are made by individ-

American spectaculars. The Euro-

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Tuesday Edition
Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

 

During the last few days, there has been
a great deal of heated discussion over the
merits of Lamar Lamb’s proposal that the
present penalty for a violation of the Honor
System be reduced from absolute expulsion
to automatic expulsion for one year, with the
convicted student eligible for reinstatement
upon review of his case by the Executive Com-
mittee. The editors of the Tuesday edition do
not consider the Honor System a Sacred Cow,
and welcome discussion of Mr. Lamb’s propo-
sal. Nevertheless, we disagree with the pro-
posal, and consider it one of the most poorly
formulated ideas to be seriously presented be-
fore the student body in recent memory. In
support of the proposal, Lamb and his follow-
ers offer a wide variety of reasons for change,
some of which are downright false, and all of
which hold little or no water. This editorial
will debate the merits of each reason.

THE “SOCIETY” ANALOGY...

1. Lamb, in his mimeographed letter
Thursday night, states that we punish a violat-
or here much more than they would be pun-
ished elsewhere. From this rather obvious fact,
he manages to conclude that students who are
convicted of an Honor System violation can-
not get into other schools, a conclusion which
is false. Students who are convicted here
regularly enroll in other institutions, as Dean
Atwood can testify. Lamb, an EC member,
should know better. As a matter of fact, we
defy him to offer as evidence a case in which
a convicted student has been unable to enroll
in another college. Further, the fact that
“society” does not penalize as we do here does
not mean we must conform: society, we might
point out, has a big problem with lying, cheat-
ing, and stealing.

“SPURIOUS” ASSUMPTIONS...

2. As the second point in his letter, Lamb
states that “our punishment assumes that if a
person does something dishonorable once, he
is forever dishonorable. This assumption is
spurious.” We agree, the assumption is spur-
ious. It’s so spurious, in fact, that no one
makes it. The Honor System does not presume
to declare a man forever dishonorable: it only
states that a student who has not the will
power to refrain from lying, cheating, or steal-
ing does not belong at Washington and Lee.
In the light of innumerable benefits of the
Honor System (and we can ennumerate them
if you like), is that too much to ask?

THE PRINCIPAL OF FORGIVENESS ...

3. As his third point, Lamb and his coterie
invoke Christianity, declaring that the present
expulsion violates the principle of forgive-
ness. The principle of forgiveness, when im-
properly used (as it is in this case) is an all-
purpose platitude which could be used to out-
law everything from speeding tickets on up.
We certainly have no quarrel with Christianity,
and we agree that forgiveness is admirable.
But we are leery of the practical applicability
of forgiveness. In case after case, other insti-
tutions have found that the introduction of
graduated penalities into an Honor System
has caused the downfall of the system: student
body officers from other schools (notably

Goldwater—W ill Public Opinion ‘Draft’ Him as Nominee

The Honor System Defended

Wake Forest and Hampden-Sydney) on cam-
pus for an ODK convention this week-end
have stressed this fact. And there is one other
important point: Lamb says we must forgive
because we “‘cannot allow a man’s life to be
ruined.” This is a rather broad statement, and
adds a note of melodrama to the argument.
We certainly do not deny that conviction of an
Honor Court violation is a highly disturbing
experience, but does it ruin a man’s life? Is
a convicted student’s life really made unbear-
able and worthless? Again, we must ask Mr.
Lamb to provide evidence for his argument.

THE CLINCHER...

4. And then Mr. Lamb provides the clinch-
er: he says that absolute expulsion was only
instituted thirty years ago. This statement is
completely false, and is typical of the hap-
hazard nature of the proposal. And we might
add that the editors of the Ring-tum Phi which
appeared last Saturday reprinted this state-
ment, knowing that it had no foundation in
fact. Actually, the present penalty has been
in effect since the Honor System first took
its present form, somewhere between 1870
and 1890.

SAVING THE INDIVIDUAL...

5. Another argument, set forth by Protest,
is that the individual suffers at the hands of
a sterile system. This is mere word-play. The
proponents of this argument, in their haste
to come to the aid of the “individual,” forget
the one thousand and fifty other individuals
who benefit from the “‘sterile”’ system.

6. Finally, there is the ‘Great Taboo of
Tradition” argument. We are told that we are
cowards, “‘cloaked” in this tradition, and that
Lamar Lamb has come to lead us out of the
darkness and into the light. What, may we
ask, is so horrifying about tradition, and why
should we do away with a tradition which,
over the years, has provided so many very real
benefits?

In conclusion, we would like to offer an
argument of our own. We firmly believe that
the very great majority of students at Wash-
ington and Lee subscribe to an abstract code
of honesty, that the students here believe that
it is wrong to lie, cheat, or steal. This means
that a violation of the Honor System is a much
greater offense than, for example, failing out
of school. If, however, we allow a student
who has been convicted of an Honor System
violation to return, we are, in effect, saying
that lying, cheating, and stealing are really
not so bad, and the Honor System, as it has
done in so many other schools, will quickly
degenerate into a strictly punitive system in
which honesty is not a matter of respect, but a
matter of what one can get away with. Because
of our Honor System, students here may en-
joy the self-satisfaction that comes when one
knows that he is trusted, and may enjoy the
convenience of being able to trust other stu-
dents. And all we have to do to maintain the
system is refrain from lying, cheating, or steal-
ing. When the entire system is at stake, is it
too much to ask that those very few students
who cannot do so be permanently expelled?

We don’t think it is.

Washington and Lee is fast ap-
proaching a moment of decision
which may well affect the future of
this University’s position of leader-
ship in the area of higher education,
not only in the South, but in the
entire nation as well. The great de-
bate over the proposed, and opposed,
integration of Washington and Lee
grows in fervor and intensity with
each passing day. And it would seem
evident that sooner or later (prob-
ably sooner), W&L will have to
take its stand.

Whether we like it or not, the
days are forever past when we
could sweep the whole question
of race relations under a carpet
or dignified neutrality, in such a
situation. It is clearly the respon-
sibility of every one of us who is
concerned about Washington and
Lee’s welfare—students, faculty,
the administration, the alumni—to
ponder seriously in his own mind
the personal stand which he must
take on this question.

But it is upon the _ individual
member of the student body that
the greatest responsibility falls. As
with any other university, we are
Washington and Lee’s most import-
ant raison d’etre. And as such we
must make our voices heard on the
very real issues which are sure to
touch us.

But how many of us really know
what we want to say? In the current

Editor
The Ring-tum Phi
Dear Sir:

The Friday issue of the Ring-tuia
Phi was overly generous in identi-
fying me with the new catalogue re-
vision. However, Governor Darden
advised us here Friday evening
that a person should never deny
anything good said about him. So
rather than deny the editor’s kind
remarks, I would like to see that
others involved in the catalogue
revision receive deserving credit.

Without the splendid cooperation
of the various deans, chiefly Dean
Pusey and Dean Gilliam, the heads
of the academic departments, and
above all, my assistant, Mrs. Robert

 

discussions about integration in the
columns of the Ring-tum Phi, and
in bull sessions in fraternity houses
and dormitories, it seems that an ex-
tremist few on both sides of the
situation are doing all the talking.
This is deplorable. The problem be-
longs to all of us. It is up to all of us,
then, to attempt to solve it.

And yet a_ well-thought-out
view of the issue, based on fact
rather than cliches is a prerequi-
site for intelligent participation in
any debate. The contention that
integration is “obviously right”
or “obviously wrong” has no place
in our academic community. If
something is “obvious,” there can
me no dispute about it—only
agreement and acceptance. Such is
the case here.

The time has come when clear-
thinking men of good will on both
sides of this important question must
enter into honest dialogue with each

At The Integration Threat —

other in order to find an answer that
will

best serve the interests of
Washington and Lee.
There are many people, in all

areas of the life of this University,
who feel that Washington and Lee
will be integrated within ten years,
if not sooner. If this estimate is cor-
rect and it appears to be so, then
it is incumbent upon every one of us
to be ready for it when it comes.

The days ahead may not be easy
ones. There will be hurt feelings,
anger, even hatred. Old friendships
will collapse. The University com-
munity could possibly be split ir-
reparably asunder. It has happened
elsewhere; it could well happen
here. To avert such a tragedy, let us
begin today to examine together the
whole question of the integration
of Washington and Lee on a basis
of real love and understanding. Per-
haps then we shall come to know
the truth, and as with all other
things, the truth shall make us free.

Having repaired to the Paramount
to mull over the various class elec-
tions we have
come up with sev-
eral observations.
Did Lamar Lamb
win a junior E.C.
post because of
the party, the is-
sue, or the man?
His running mate,
Malcolm Morris,
fared equally well
numerically in
the voting yet he
campaigned
against Lamb’s stand— to replace
expulsion with a year of absence
for an honor offense.

The observer concludes that the
issue played a minor part in the
election of Lamb to the party and
the man. Lamb’s proposal now will
be fully discussed by next year’s
Executive Committee, aired in the
Ring-tum Phi and among stu-
dents as it should be—after which
we hope it is soundly defeated by
the EC.

Of Last Night's Elections

 

the rising sophomore class elections

 

 

 

Brief Review

brought David Gerald Gordon,
known affectionately as the “Fly,”
into office as secretary. The bandy-
legged freshman, independent, a
truely popular man in his class, ran
against the grip of party cliques and
was successful at the “polls” to win
the post.

It is equally refreshing to see
the obviously best qualified man
win an office regardless of party
affiliation or political engineering.
Art Broadus was elected last night
by acclamation to become the
president of next year’s LF.C.
Broadus’ keen interest in the fu-
ture of fraternities, experience on
the Council and respect with the
faculty and administration should
make him one of the best leaders
that body has had.

We hear a great deal on campus
and in state and national elections
about how little one individual’s
vote counts. In the rising senior class
elections for historian. Tom Pace
and Pete Candler are tied at 97
votes apiece, requiring as we under-
stand it a re-vote. Each vote counted
heavily in that election as each vote,
ultimately, counts in every demo-
cratic election.

 

 

Stewart, I would be wallowing still
in galley proofs, and there would
be no catalogue of any kind. Also,

the book must go to the Richmond
printers, Whittet & Shepperson
whose firm handled the gigantic job
of resetting so much type so cleanly
and so efficiently.

Finally, I think the publication of

the general University atmosphere,
in which changes for the better take
place with greater frequency than
many realize.

Sincerely,
FRANK A. PARSONS

Presidential Nom

inations, Part One

 

By JAMES HYATT
Staff Columnist

Goldwater for president? You're
out of your mind if you think it’s
not possible. Millions of conserva-
tives seem to be promulgating the
idea from Massachusetts to Cali-
fornia. What does this wirey-haired,
bespectacled Senator from Arizona
have that attracts the populace?
Many would have us believe it is a
political philosophy. Hopefully, this
writer will consider the Senator's
philosophy as the prime motivation
behind the move to draft him for
the presidential nomination. How-
ever, a discussion on conservatism
is not the point of this article. An
attempt is being made to summarize
the latest political moves across this
nation to align the voters behind
“the winner” in 1964,

An Outsanding Record

Senator Goldwater has an envia-
ble past. His record shows that he
is amply educated; (a graduate of
Staunton Military Academy and an

 

alumnus...attended one year... of
the University of Arizona,) comes
from a wealthy family; is a Briga-
dier General in the U.S.A.F. res.; is
a young 52; has sired four children;
been a city council man for three
years; a Senator of the United
States since 1954; is the leading rep-
resentative of the conservative wing
of the Republican Party; serves on
Interior and Insular Affairs Com-
mittee; Labor and Public Welfare
Committee; and Navajo and Hopi
Indian Administration Committee;
and, hold onto your hats, is a Sigma
Chi! With the possible exception
of the last named item, Senator
Goldwater is, and has been, free
of any seandal during his political
career.

A month ago Barry Goldwater
definitely asserted that he was not a
candidate for the Presidency; that
he was hoping to continue as Sena-
tor; and that any move to prompt
him into the limelight would be to
no avail. This past week has brought
another tune from the Arizonian.

 

Headquarters are being set up in
Texas, Washington, D.C., and other
states, with the sole purpose of
gaining convention votes, via popu-
lar demand, to draft Goldwater at
the Republican convention in 1964.
Goldwater's comments? “I have giv-
en up trying to stop it....But I
don’t think that I could get the nom-
ination for President even if I went
after it....” The Senator’s humble-
ness overwhelmed his campaign
manager who said, “Oh hell, give up,
and see what happens, Barry.” This
writer feels that millions will join
the already swelling mass of “Gold-
waterites” just to prove that an un-
derdog can win in America, Sound
familiar?

Rockefeller’s Success

Governor Rockefeller might erell
prove to be the key to success in
nominating Mr. Goldwater. The Gov-
ernor’s aides have signs already
painted which read, “...for Presi-
dent.” They are hopefully expecting
to put in “Rocky” but a few minor

altercations seem to be hindernmg
the political artistry. Some claim the
paint pot should be smeared in tne
blank and their reasons have a cer-
tain degree of merit. I think it only
fair to cover his better side firss,
which, without a doubt, overshad-
ows all the recent “scandals.” Of
course, it is rumored that Nelso.
Rockefeller comes from a wealthy
family, just like Kennedy and
Seranton, ete. His public service
background is outstanding and even
his opposition admits this fact.
Rockefeller is in his second term as
Governor of New York State, win-
ning, both times, by a substantial
margin. The Governor's first term
brought solvency to N.Y.S. through
tax inereases and when a surplus
was formed, he ordered a tax cut
instead of dreaming up new bureaur-
cratic ways of spending it. Busi-
ness had clamored to get into his
state, offering more jobs to the citi-
zens. Rockefeller is definitely not
one to look for federal handouts on
behalf of New York. He preserves

 

WELL, NOW, WASN'T THAT
THOUGHTFUL OF HER? NICE LITTLE
FLANNEL SQUARES... JUST THE
SORT THAT ONE MIGHT GET IF
ONE CUT UP ONES... ..cccese

 

 

 

 

 

states’ rights by exercising state re-
sponsibility. And, last, Rockefeller
is a staunch defender of the “hard
line” in the cold war.

The Result of Remarriage

But what does the future hold for
Mr. Rockefeller? Passing quickly
through such matters as his legisla-
ture balking when he sneaked a tax
inerease in under “ another name”
this year, and that matter of Judson
Morehouse accepting liquor money
from a Playboy bunny and_ then
claiming immunity, quiting his job
and retiring to his estate, we get
to Mrs. Rockefeller.

Margaretta Murphy, the recently
divorced wife of Dr. James Mur-
phy of New York, has just become
the wife of Governor Rockefeller.
The shouts of, “It must be Craw-
ford” changed to “Murphy” and now
there are no shouts.

From a political point of view, this
writer feels that Rockefeller’s recent
marriage will affect his popularity
very little. Americans have a tran-

 

 

in 64?

sient mentality which will, in time
allow most of those persons wh
were morally stung by his divore

Thinclads 4th

By TOM CARPENTER |
Maybe the Washington and Lee
baseball team should change its
name from the Generals to the Hit-
less Wonders after Saturday’s 5-4
victory over Frederick College of
Portsmouth at W&L.

The Generals scored two runs in
the first without benefit of a hit and
added the three decisive runs in the
second on a longe single by fresh-
man sensation Eric Sisler, whose hit
did not even drive in a run.

Chris Wigert, the personable lefty,
went the distance to gain his fourth
win agains one defeat. Wigert tossed
a five-hitter and allowed only one
earned run. He had some control
problems, though, walking eight.

The Generals took advantage of
losing pitcher Dave Walton’s first in-
ning wildness to pick up the first
two runs. Walton walked four of
the first five hitters with Howie
Martin getting the one with the
sacks loaded to force Sisler across
the plate. Chuck Lane scored the
second run on Lou Paterno’s infield

In State Meet

By DON CASTO

Defending champion William and
Mary successfully maintained its
title as the best track team in Vir-
ginia last Saturday in the state meet.
The heavily-favored Indians racked
up seventy-one points to second
place VMI’s forty-seven. The Uni-
versity of Virginia was third with
twenty-five points; and Washington
and Lee’s cindermen placed a close
fourth, scoring twenty-three points.

Jumper Robin Kell captured the
only first place in the varsity events
for the Generals. He jumped forty-
three feet, nine inches to become
state champion in the triple jump.

Skip Essex was edged out at the
finish line in the 440-yard dash in
an exciting race. The winning time
was forty-nine seconds flat, and
Skip had a time of forty-nine and
two tenths seconds.

Sprinter Kit Kell, who has been
plagued by a serious leg injury all

hundred yard dash to everyone’s
surprise. Hurlder John Pearson took

the conference’s four spring sports—

Washington University’s “Battling
Bears”—the conference's largest
member—will bring unusually
strong teams in tennis, golf and
track to Lexington. The Bears, who
won the league basketball trophy
at Sewanee in February, rate as fav-
orites in the quest for the Presi-
dents’ Trophy—a 300-pound loco-
motive bell which is the symbol of
the year-old conference.

Two unusual features will mark
the festival:

There will be a strong emphasis
on good will and friendly associa-

Baseball Team Defeated By Eagles

(Continued from page 3)

The other big threat by Frederick |
in the eighth was terminated when,
with runners on second and third,
Dick Brown made a great running
catch of a line shot by Bonnie Stev-
enson for the third out.

Walton held the Generals to three
hits, two by Sisler and an infield
single by Paterno.

Yesterday the Generals invaded
Bridgewater and came out on the
short end of a 13-10 score when the
Eagles scored six runs in the eighth.
Wigert lost in relief.

W&L scored four in the first on a
combination of three walks, a sac-
rifice fly by Martin, a single by
Buck Rose, and a double by Lane.

The winners retaliated with four
in their half of the frame on three
walks and a grandslam homer by
Jim Benson off starter Paterno, who
was removed in the third because
of control trouble in favor of Mason |
MeGowin.

In the fourth W&L moved back ,
into the lead on a walk to Rose!
and singles by Pete Candler, Me-
Gowin, and Sisler.

Bridgewater came back with three
unearned runs in the fifth on three
singles, two wild pitches, and an
error, but the Generals regained the
lead in the sixth with two runs.
Rose and Candler singled and Mc-
Gowin sacrificed. Sisler drove in
Rose with a sacrifice fly, and Cand-
ler scored on an error on Allen’s
grounder. It looked over in the sev-
enth when W&L added two more
on a walk to Lane, a bunt single by
Lou Flanagan, a sacrifice fly by Bob
Taylor, and a single by Rose, but
the Eagles were not through.

McGowin walked the first batter
and then yielded a single to winning
pitcher George Funkhouser, who
ended up on third on two errors.
Another single brought in Funk-
houser to make it 10-9. A stolen base
and a fly ball put the tying run on
third. The tiring McGowin was re-
moved in favor of Wigert, who
tossed a wild pitch to let the tying
run score. Wigert walked the first

to Yager Marks, who scored on a

hitter ,but was tagged for a round-
tripper by Carlton Cox to make it

get the last out.

Sisler, Rose, and Candler were the
big hitters for the Generals. Sisler,
who is the team leader in batting
with a .452 mark, went three-for-

He has shown fine qualities in his
work on the dance sets this year and
we are positive he will do a great
job next year.”

He added, “I would also like to
commend the fine work put in this
year by the other candidates. They
are all due a great deal of praise.”

Pace Picks At Peck’s Role
In ‘To Kill A Mockingbird

By TOM PACE
Movie Columnist

“To Kill a Mockingbird” is at the |

State Theater now, and will play
for a week.

Although there are many good
things about this film, there are

some things which
are not so good.
Being negative by
nature, I will be-
gin by enumerat-
ing the bad.
Gregory Peck
will do fine for a
starter. I can think
of no other actor
more overrated by

 

' the mass of the

Tem wean nation’s movie
goers. Peck has

two expressions; one for joy, love,

and passivity, and the other for sor-
row, anguish, hate, despair, anger,
apprehension and whatever else is
called for.

The difference in these two ex-
pression is a slight curling of the
mouth. Peck is certainly one of the
most ineffectual actors in films
now, and his portrayal of Atticus
Finch is stolid, uninteresting, and
unconcerning,. To think that he re-
ceived the Academy Award for

this performance reflects severely
on both the Academy's taste, and
their truly democratic process of
election.

Next, I'm almost afraid
is Mary Badham, the little Birm-
ingham girl who plays Scout. Her
point of view is used in telling the
story. This non-professional little
actress proves only that she is no
more apt than any other eight-year-
old pretending to be something she
isn’t. Time after time, whether she
is supposed to be gay, afraid, serious,
or sad, she keeps acoy expression
on her face that seems to be saying,
“Aren’t I cute?” Okay, I give her
that much, She is cute. Unfortunate-
ly, she is not Scout, and not an ac-
tress.

to say,

The sereenplay by Horton Foote
is in excellent taste. Except for his
overdramatization of the trial, Foote
is adequately loyal to the novel. His
dialogue is generally very good.

Director Robert Mulligan handles
the film sucessfully. He keeps the
mood subdued and peaceful, and
honestly impressed me that here was
a real southern town, with, for the
most part, real southern people, I
left the theater, my overall impres-
sion being that I had a very pleasant

than 250 athletes in the College Ath-
letic Conference’s first Spring Sports
Festival.

The five member colleges and uni-
versities will be competing for the
championships in the conference’s
four spring sports—baseball, golf,
tennis, track and field. Highpoint
of the two-day meet is the general

conference championship which goes |
to the school with best overall rec-|
| ord and includes their performance’s

in football and basketball earlier this
year.

In addition to W&L, Centre Col-
lege of Kentucky, Southwestern at
Memphis, University of South (Se-
wanee), and Washington University
Louis have entered teams in
competition.

A welcoming kick-off dinner was
Thursday night at Evans

Body Split On Lamb’ s Proposal

_ \Majority Of Those Polled

Favor Modifying System

Polling a cross-section of about
10) students Thursday resulted in
an almost 50-50 split opinion over
Lemar Lamb’s proposed change in
the Honor System penalty.

About 80 per cent of the persons
polled, however, were in favor of
modification of the Honor System
as it now stands.

While the freshmen seemed widely
in favor of the proposal, real class-
wide opinions didn’t emerge in the
upper three grades; sophomores,
juniors and seniors seemed split
evenly on the proposal as Lamb has
stated it. Nearly « everyone, however,

Glee Cha
Ends Season

Successfully

By GENE HATFIELD

The Washington and Lee glee club
concluded its “most successful” sea-
son last week with the election of
officers. Jim Mell, a three-year vet-
eran, was chosen to lead the organ-
ization next year as president.

Others elected to offices were Jere
Cravens, business manager, Rich
Hartgrove, secretary, Larry Meeks,
treasurer, Gordon Archer and Gene
Hatfield co-publicity chairmen, and
Maurice Fliess and Wicky Stewart,
librarians.

In terming this year as the organ-
ization’s “most successful,” Mr. Rob-
ert Stewart, director, cited the club’s
two tours to Atlanta, Georgia, and
Wilmington, Delaware, in addition to
the group’s regular appearances in
the local area.

Plans for next year include a trip
to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and
another trip with possible destina-
tions being Louisville, Kentucky or
Cincinnati, Ohio. The final decision
will be based in large measure on
where the club can do the university
most good in the field of public re-
lations.

Also planned are two concerts with
area girls’ schools. A concert at
Sweet Briar has been definitely ar-
ranged and a date with another
school, possibly Randolph-Macon, is
being worked on.

The organization's second record
is to be cut this summer from tapes
of past concerts. It will be the fol-
low-up to the club's first record, the
Sixties—Vol. I, still on sale at the
University Book Store. A major por-
tion of the record will be devoted to
show tunes.

Approximately 15 new members
will be needed to fill out the club for
next year’s activities. Upperclassmen
will be given preference over incom-
ing freshmen. Any upperclassman
interested should see Mr. Stewart
sometime between now and semester
exams for an audition. No previous

 

experience is necessary.

Selections to be added to the club’s |
repertoire for next year will include |
a number of Gilbert-Sullivan tunes, |
a French drinking song and seve ral
fun and novelty songs.

 

felt the present system needs change.

Non-fraternity students polled ap-
peared to be about 80 per cent for,
20 per cent against the standing pro-
posal.

Two persons polled, a freshman
fraternity member and a non-frater-
nity senior, favored complete aboli-
tion of the Honor System.

An attempt was made by the Fri-
day Ring-tum Phi to poll propor-
tional numbers of Southerners and
Notherners, fraternity and non-fra-
ternity men, and equal numbers of

persons in each class.
Those polled were asked (1) if
they favored Lamb’s proposal and

(2) if not, whether they thought
some change in the standing system
was necessary.

While tthe first question got an al-
most equal number of pro and con
answers, students felt that the system
as it stands is inadequate.

About five per cent of the persons
polled indicated they thought the
system is now “based on fear.”

Several felt the system is a fear
system because of the secrecy sur-
rounding it, and advocated increased
explanation of just what does and
does not constitute a violation.

A number of students, notably
juniors and seniors, said the system
should be codified further in order
to let the student know more about
the EC’s definition of honor.

Approximately 15 per cent of the
students questioned opposed Lamb's
plan because they felt, in a junior’s
words:

“We need to think about this some
more. Something definitely needs to
be done to improve the present pen-
alty, but we ought to think about it
longer before coming up with such
a rigid plan (as Lamb’s). Lamar’s

Seales Banquet
Set May 15

By KEN McGRAW

The Washington and Lee Alumni
Association will hold its annual ban-
quet in honor of the graduating
seniors at 6:30 p.m., Wednesday, May
15th, at Evans Dining Hall. All aca-
demic and low seniors as well as
those who will graduate in February,
1964, are invited to attend.

The program will consist of a per-
formance by the Sazeraes, and talks
by University President Fred C.
Cole and Alumni Association Execu-
tive Secretary, William C. Wash-
burn. The high point, however, will
be the presentation of the first Frank
J. Gilliam award to an outstanding

senior. The Executive Committee is
in charge of this presentation.
Mr. Washburn stated that the

banquet is given by the Alumni As-
sociation as a token to the gradu-
ating seniors. The Alumni Associa-
tion, he added, wants to welcome
them as alumni and to impress on
them their privilege as well as their
responsibility as alumni of Washing-

Troubs Feature Four One-A ct Plays
Produced And Directed B y Students

By CHARLES NEWMAN

and JERRY COFFMAN
Thursday night the Troubadours
presented two one-act plays, Chee-
Chee and Purgatory, The plays will
be repeated Saturday night at 8:30
in the Troubadour Theatre. These
plays, along with two _ presented
Wednesday night and repeated to-
night, The Apollo of Bellac and
Krapp’s Last Tape, are the third and
last productions for the Troubs this

year.
Chee-Chee, written by Luigi Pi-
sandello, is a comedy which deals

with a high-class con man who ends
up with the money and the girl. The
play is the kind you expect to see
when you go to a production of this
type, but due to the acting of Charles
Bright, the play doesn‘t drag to the
presupposed ending.

All these plays
students who are

directed by
advanced di-

are
in

 

recting courses; in the case of Chee-

Chee the director is Charles C. Flip-
pen,
The second paly, Purgatory, by

William Butler Yeats, is a poetic dra-
ma Although the play is rather short,
it is an excellent production. The
stage setting is well-designed, well-
decorated, and effective, but the
complete success of the production
must be credited to the superb act- |
ing of Starke Sydnor. The play pre-

 

sents a conflict between the tradi-
tions of the old and the changing
ways of the new. Sydnor portrays

the Old Man who experiences a liv-|
ing “purgatory,” caused by his past |
and present deeds. The play is cap-
ably directed by John R. Dunnell.
The plays Friday and Saturday |
night will begin at 8:30. Reservations

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Friday Edition

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

 

Let Us Remember

The past two issues of the Ring-tum Phi have had editorial
columns filled with arguments and counter-arguments debating
our Honor System. It has caused many people to stand up for
what they believe and make an evaluation of their standards.

A very ugly and base threat has risen out of this, however,
that goes beyond these questions which have been brought
forth. The very freedom of the press has been questioned
by members of the student body, and attempts have been made
to suppress divergent ideas.

We submit that those who attempt such moves should stop
and re-evaluate themselves and their beliefs. If one does not
agree with a new idea, that is his privilege, but the supporters of
that idea have a right to be heard. After this idea is heard, it
can be discussed, defended, or rejected. Attempts at suppres-
sion, however, have no place in our society and suggest a basic
weakness in the argument of the “suppressor” when they are
attempted.

It is good to remember Thomas Jefferson’s words: “No
government ought to be without a censor; and where the press
is free, none will ever be.

We must all remember that a newspaper is more than
a report or feature, it is more than an entertaining project. It
is a means of betterment. It cannot be denied its rights of ex-
pression. Again, in the words of Jefferson, ‘when the press is
free and every man is able to read, all is safe.” We hope that
this is never forgotten.

G. A. N.

A Lament

It was ironic to read the following statement which appeared
in the editorial written by Lanny Butler in last Tuesday’s paper:
“The editors of the Tuesday edition do not consider the Honor
System a Sacred Cow, and welcome discussion of Mr. Lamb’s
proposal.” In light of Butler’s actions one week ago today, this
statement is not only ironic, but hypocritical.

For three hours last Friday morning, Butler, along with
other EC members, attempted to remove the editorial in that
edition which endorsed Lamar Lamb’s proposal to modify the
permanent expulsion penalty of our Honor System. He failed
in this objective because, as Editor of the Tuesday edition, he
has no jurisdiction over the Friday paper.

Upon his failure to suppress discussion of Lamb’s proposal,
Butler threatened to have Lamb withdrawn from the Pro-
gressive Party slate of candidates. He also failed in this attempt.
Over the past weekend, popular support for Lamar Lamb’s
proposal grew tremendously. It was endorsed fully by EC man
Meade Christian. Individual support increased. The possibility
that our Honor System could be improved was the talk of
Washington and Lee.

Then, at 5 p.m. last Monday, the EC met to consider some
final measure which might suppress the growing support for
Lamb. In its most devious move to date, the EC then passed a
resolution by a 10-2 vote which was read during the nominating
conventions that night—it was a statement politically slanted
against Lamb’s proposal. This action was not only unfair, but
also hypocritical. The EC men who read the statement con-
cluded it with the assurance that it was not an attempt to in-
fluence voting. This riduculous statement met with laughter
and loud boos in the sophomore convention.

Individual members of the EC have done their best to
deny to this edition of The Ring-tum Phi and to individual
students the right of question and criticism. Ten of the twelve
members of the EC have been unable to recognize the fact
that a system is fallible by definition. But by burying their
heads in the proverbial sand, these EC men have literally dei-
fied the Honor System. They consider it absolutely perfect.
And yet they used every tactic in their power to snuff out criti-
cism of this perfect system—apparently they felt (last week,
at any rate) that our Honor System is quite fragile. It might
break when subjected to careful scrutiny.

These ten members of the EC have missed the point of
Lamar Lamb’s proposal altogether. Though they criticize
supporters of the proposal for failing to think sufficiently about
it, sadly enough they themselves have never seriously consider-
ed the suggestion which they have rejected. This is proved in
the following editorial. Ten members of the EC are so obsessed
with the infallibility of a system that they are unable to see
either its criticism or its critics.

This is sad, for blind men are very sad indeed.

0.5.7.4. 18%

A Sacred Cow...
But No Bull Today

Those members of the Executive Committee who are most
opposed to the suggested change in the administration of our
Honor System have tried, more than anything else, to blur
the central issue. The most outstanding example of this ten-
dency to date is the editorial written by Lanny Butler which
appeared in last Tuesday’s paper. He carefully stepped all
around Lamar Lamb’s proposal, without ever actually confront-
ing it.

It is important to realize that what Lamb’s proposal suggests
is not the abolition of the present absolute penalty, as Butler

contends; rather, it does suggest that within the framework of
the Honor System some provision should be made to allow
a convicted individual to be considered for re-admission.
The proposal does not advocate a blanket one-year penalty.
Flagrant or deliberate violators obviously acting in cold and
calculated abuse of the Washington and Lee code of honor,
would be permanently dismissed, as is now done. In the case
of a student whose violation indicated mitigating corcumstances
(such as extreme emotional instability induced temporarily by
family or other problems, or such as ignorance of the letter of
the Honor System), then—under amb’s proposal—that stu-
dent might be considered for a less than permanent expulsion.

Thus, the proposal does not assure a violator of re-admit-
tance, nor does it obligate the EC to penalize all violators with
a one-year expulsion. It does allow for the possibility that a
student guilty of an honor violation is also an honest person.
No member of the EC can claim with honesty that every con-
victed student has deserved what he got under our present
system of permanent expulsion. Under Lamb’s proposal, the
EC would have a power in addition to that which it has now:
it could offer the basically honest violator an opportunity to live
down his mistake, and thereby re-build his reputation.

We look now at Lanny Butler’s arguments against this

proposal:
1. He stated that Lamb “manages to conclude that students
who are convicted of an Honor System violation cannot get
into other schools, a conclusion which is false.” Certainly the
conclusion is false. Lamb has never contended that violators
get into any other schools. He has contended that they cannot
get into schools comparable to W&L in academics and prestige.
The instances are rare indeed, according to administration of-
ficials, when violators here get into good institutions.

2. For Butler to say that the Honor System does not oper-
ate, under the present penalty, on the assumption that a per-
son once dishonorable is always dishonorable would be laugh-
able if it weren’t so pathetic. The present system says that a
convicted violator may never again become a part of the Wash-
ington and Lee community. Why? Because he is dishonorable.
If he is not dishonorable forever, then why ban him forever?

In the academic community at W&L, the violator is pre-
sumed irrevocably dishonorable—there is not even the admis-
sion of the possibility that he could adhere to the code of honor
within the environment in which he has been labeled dishonor-
able. For the rest of that convicted person’s life, whether he is
applying to another college or trying to get a job, W&L must
faithfully report that he was dismissed from school here due to
an honor offense. This may be justice in the case of the fla-
grant violator; we are concerned, however, with the student
who committed no heinous violation, who is basically honest,
but who was expelled because of a violation of the letter of the
law. And these cases have existed and they will in the future,
unless a change is made.

3. Butler next criticized ‘‘Lamb and his coterie” (see Letters
to the Editor) for evoking the Christian idea of forgiveness,
which Butler apparently feels just complicates the issue. It
might be idealistic to say that the honorable man should also
be a compassionate man—but so is it idealistic to claim that
there are 1,000 people at W&L abiding by a code of honor
out of an overwhelming obsession with purity.

Butler indicates that other schools, after having instituted
graduated penalties, witnessed the downfall of their honor sys-
tem. Perhaps, but in other schools such graduated penalties
may well have been instituted as a last desperate attempt to
save already floundering systems, This, hopefully, is not the
case here.

4. We shall now discuss what Butler calls ‘the clincher’’:
Lamb’s statement that the present penalty was instituted only
thirty years ago. We regret that Butler, before he unknowing-
ly called this statement “completely false,” did not take a few
minutes to check into the matter. Lamb did. According to
Lamb, penalties other than the present one were invoked as late
as 1936; while he, as an EC member, is unable to reveal speci-
fic instances or cases to the general student body, he assures us
that there were convicted honor violators who received less
than the present penalty. Perhaps Student Body Secretary
Butler should mull over past EC minutes.

The ten EC men who have fought so vigorously against
Lamar Lamb’s proposal are opposed basically to the word
“change.” They have voted against it almost invariably all
year long. We do not support change in itself—we support
an idea which has great merit. It is time that we all rise above
a petty opposition to the mere idea of change, and see if this
particular proposed change would be valuable to our Honor
System. Rather than corrupt our system, as some EC men
have charged, we believe that this proposal, if adopted, would
strengthen the system. What will weaken the system, con-
versely, is for it to remain exactly as it is now for any great
length of time.

Meade Christian

Dear Sir:

The title of Tuesday's Ring-tum
Phi editorial unfortunately implied
that those who support Lamar
Lamb’s proposal of reinstatement
make up the anti-Honor System
while those who disagree are the
Honor System’s protectors. As I have
stated previously, this proposal is
not aimed at the destruction of the
System, nor do I believe that des-
truction would be the result.

What I am certain of, however,
is that the policy of automatic ex-
pulsion without the hope of re-
admission creates a_ conflict of
values tht has plagued me as an
EC member throughout the year.
I do not understand the Tuesday
Editor's basis for labeling the
principle of forgiveness “improper-
erly used” in this regard, but if he
is referring to its impracticality,
then I would remind him that
there is much about Christianity
that is impractical and yet demand-
ed by those who accept it.

Of course there are many at Wash-
ington and Lee to whom this argu-
ment means little or nothing, and
to these I would like to explain
why this proposal may be quite
practical after all. From my exper-
ience I believe that there are few
premeditated honor offenses com-
mitted here. Most occur in a moment

student has not take time to famil-
arize himself with the rules as they
apply to a particular course. Since,
as the Tuesday editorial admits, such
an offense is no sign of permanent
dishonesty, what is wrong with al-
lowing the convicted student to re-
enter the community that banished
him and have an opportunity to
demonstrate that his mistake was
contrary to his true nature?

The reply to this proposal is
usually that such a policy would
bring the “downfall of the system.”
Although to my _ knowledge this
phrase has not been defined, I as-
sume that it deals with a loss of
respect for the Honor System in
the eyes of the students and a
heightened incentive to commit vio-
lations.

Whether or not the former fear
would materialize depends for the
most part, as it dees now, on the
way in which the Honor System is
presented to the student body by
the EC; and also it should be ob-
vious by now tht there are some
students whose respect for the sys-
would increase if such a change
were brought about.

As for the second feared reaction,
expulsion for one year and the loss
of face suffered with friends and
family are certainly more than a
smack on the hand.

In short, then, Lamar Lamb's pro-
posal seems to me both right and
practical. I think that there has
been much honest effort to be ob-
jective by those both for and against
Lamar’s proposal, and I sincerely
hope that the Executive Committee
of 1963-64 will carefully evaluate
all of the arguments put forth.

Dear Sir:

The question of changing our
Honor System has aroused a great
deal of controversy recently. The
arguments seem to revolve around
the justice of expelling a student
forever as a result of his breaking
a rigid code of honor. A_ student
convicted of lying. cheating, or steal-
ing is automatically forced to leave
school with no chance of returning.
This is a just rule in principle. The

 

 

of thoughtlessness or because the}

application of this rule, however,
is an area where discretion is neces-
sary.

During my four years at Washing-
ton and Lee I have not had the op-
portunity to serve on the Execu-
tive Committee. Therefore I can-
not speak with assurance concerning
Executive committee honor trials.
Nevertheless, I can imagine cases
in which students could technically
be guilty of an honor violation and
yet not deserve the punishment he
receives.

No one can deny that there are
many degrees of guilt. Students
make mistakes, are lazy, and often
downright stupid. This does not
mean, however, that they are dis-
honest; yet as a result of their
stupidity or laziness, they may in-
advertently lie, cheat, steal. What
chance do these students have
within such a system as ours?
Students who do not intentionally
lie, cheat, or steal should not be
punished as severely as the stu-
dent who intentionally does these
things,

Our Honor System was originally
established to protect the honest
students against those who inten-
tionally are dishonest. It was not
meant to become the mechanical
and technical abstract code that it
is today. The EC says intention can
not be determined. And yet in law
courts attempts are made to de-
termine the intentions of the ac-
cused. Punishmen is granted accord-
ing to the degree of intent in many
cases. If the members of our execu-
tive committee cannot determine
intention, they should not have the

Dear Sir:

Last Tuesday's editorial read well,
and I am sure that many points are
well taken. However, I for one, would
like to take issue with Mr. Butler on
a few points; for instance, the title:
“The Honor System Defended.” I
would like to ask from whom is he
defending it? Has anyone proposed
that we do away with it or change
its basic character in any way? No!

Let’s stop all our chattering for
a moment and examine exactly what
the proposal is. Persons convicted
of an honor offense will be auto-
matically expelled for one year and
will be eligible for readmission af-
ter one year, upon review of the case
by the EC. This does not guarantec
that he will be readmitted, it only
says he is eligible to be so. But if,
in the opinion of the EC, the student
does not merit readmission then he
will never be allowed to return to
W&L.

So perhaps for five years we
would go along without having any
cause to readmit a boy; and then
a case might come up which the
EC would consider an honor vio-
lation by convicting the student by
a two-thirds vote, then immediate -
ly recommend that the boy be
readmitted. We find ten of our

Sirs:

To say that the conviction that the
Honor System needs close examina-
tion and possible change is held by
only a few men on campus may
very well be true, though I person-
ally doubt it; but does this mean
that the conviction is wrong? Does
this means that the views of a few
should not be aired and discused and
that candidates who hold minority
views should be barred from run-
ning or expressing their ideas?

I can understand the position of
those who have valiantly and en-

Netmen Edged,
Ready For CAC

After a hard playing contest, the
varsity netmen of Coach Bill Wash-
burn finally succumbed to the Uni-
versity of Virginia 5-4 in a match
played in Lexington last Wednesday
afternoon. The individual totals were
all close as the match was still unde-
cided until the come-from-behind
victory of Virginia’s Bill Brown and
John Killebrew over the Generals’
John Baker and Lindsey Short, 5-1,
11-9, 6-2.

In the singles Washington and Lee
started off behind as Jim DeYoung
dropped the opening game 4-6, 2-6
to Bruce Farrel. John Baker made
up the deficit by disposing of Bill
Brown, 6-3, 6-3. With the score
knotted at one apiece, Randy Jones
put W&L out in front by a 6-1, 7-5
vietory over John Killebrew.

Trailing 2-1, the Wahoos won the
rest of the singles to establish a lead
that the Generals were not quite able
to overcome. Jom Mell was defeated
4-6, 3-6 by Ken Moorman; Lindsey
Short lost 3-6,5-7 to Jim Gilivee;
and Forest Dickinson was outscored
by Henry Wellwright, 4-6, 4-7.

Doubles Deciding Factor

Within the three doubles matches
remaining, W&L was behind 4-2, but
the Generals were not willing to
admit defeat although a sweep of
the doubles would be necessary for
a victory. Jim DeYoung and Randy
Jones dispatched the Virginia team
of Bruce Farrell and Ken Mooreman
6-2, 6-2 to keep the Generals in the
contest. Then came the heartbreak-
er. In the second doubles even, John
Baker and Lindsey Short met Bill
Brown and John Killebrew. The
Generals’ duo started well, winning

W&L plays host to the CAC tourna- |
ment on Friday and Saturday to
close out its 63 season. The teams
participating in the tournament will
be Centre College from Danville,
Kentucky, Sewanee (University of
the South) from Sewanee, Tennessee, ,
Southwestern University from Mem- |
phis, Tennessee, and Washington
U. from St. Louis, Missouri.

The system to be used is a
single elimination with a consolation
series to be played along with the}
finals on Saturday. Also on Saturday |
will be the selection of the all-con- |
shown good speed on his fast ball
two pitchers. It is hard to rate teams,
as W&L has played none of them
this season, but Washington U. seems
to be the favorite on its past record.

These will be the last games for
the fast finishing W&L squad. After
losing four games the Generals have
compiled a 4-7 record, and with
consistent hitting and good fielding
they could do very well.

Sisler Leads in Hitting

Four batters are presently hitting
over .300 and they are led by Eric

Sisler’s .452 average. Others over
.300 are sophomore pitcher Chris
Wigert with .360, captain Chuck

Lane with .347, and junior Martin
with an even .300. Wigert and Lane
are the leading power hitters with
two home runs each. One of the
few bright spots in W&L’s fielding
is first baseman Martin’s .987 fielding
average.

right to judge a student’s guilt at
all.

Such a change as was proposed
by Lamar Lamb seems to be praise-
worthy for its attempt to come to the
heart of the problem. A_ student
technically guilty would not auto-
matically be faced with expulsion,
and with no chance to return. Cer-
tainly he may be able now to enter
another college, but in all prob-
ability one of a vastly inferior qual-
ity than Washington and Lee.

The principle of automatic ex-
pulsion as a result of a technical
violation is unrealistic, because it
fails to take into account the com-
plex nature of human actions, Out-
right lying, cheating, and stealing
is not distinguished from thought-
less—but not intentional—lying,
cheating, and stealing. As long as
our present Honor System remains,
it is likely that honest students
who have acted foolishly or rashly
or out of ignorance will be ex-
pelled for technically lying, cheat-
ing, or stealing. The awareness of
this possibility on the part of the
student is the cause of its being
called a fear system by many.

I cannot see how providing de-
grees of punishment would weaken
the Honor System as it now stands.
Instead it would base the system on
a more realistic awareness of a stu-
dent’s moral character.

present EC immediately blasting
the proposal. I wonder what makes
them so sure they are so right and
yet have such a lack of confidence
in future Executive Committees?

I hope from the above example
that you can see why this proposal
is not so radical, why honor viola-
tions will not become more preval-
ent, and why the Honor System will
not “degenerate into a strictly puni-
tive system.”

Washington and Lee’s purpose is
not to take 350 or so students a year,
weed out the dumb and dishonest,
and then graduate the remainder.
The dumb—and hopefully—the dis-
honest have been excluded by our
select admission policy. The purpose
of W&L is to prepare these 350
men for the society in which they
will live—true, sometimes we will
fail, but we must never stop striv-
ing for the ideal.

We don’t want to send our “bad
products” into society—we want to
endeavor to show them the way to
become “good products” and then
send them forth. I dare say that a
person that makes an honest mistake
and is allowed to redeem himself
will make a far more conscientious
effort to be that “good product” than
do many who never make that ini-
tial mistake here.

Society indeed has a “big prob-
lem with lying, cheating and steal-
ing.” It is up to us to add to that
problem as little as possible and do
what we can to alleviate it. One
embittered, frustrated, basically
very honest individual aids society
and W&L very little; a thankful
one can raise the name of W&L
and its honor system.

ideal” and yet Mr. Butler is “leery
of the practical applicability of for-
giveness.” I submit that there is a
conflict here, .and I hope I am al-
lowed the W&L position. There has
been only one person, to my know-
ledge, who never was guilty of lying,
cheating, or stealing at some point in
his life; and tht person is the foun-
dation of the Christian ideal. The
fundamental prayer of this Christian
ideal which He gave us tells us to
forgive others. I am not so idealistic
as to believe this principle has
practical, universal application; but I
do believe tht we could consider it
when we dismiss a boy from schoo
on an honor violation.

Let’s not automatically cast out a
boy forever; let’s not be quite so

sure we are always right; let’s show |

humility and forgiveness to some
extent incorporating into our Hon-
or System a chance, remote that it
may be, for a person to redeem him-
self.

thusiastically appointed themselves
“defenders of the Honor System,”
as if someone wanted to destroy it;
for I, too, have stood up for our
code as it exists now against criti-
cisms of students in other schools.
(It is noteworthy that the criticism
of students from other schools has
centered around what I understand
to be the main issue of the present
proposal, the lack of provision for
possible forgiveness and a _ second
chanee.) I see no reason, however,
why one must resort to question-
able methods in this case to defend
something he believes is right.

I am in sympathy with the cur-
rent proposal to a degree: to a
great enough degree to be anxious
to see what comes of it. I am con-
fident that the new EC will give
careful and fair consideration to
this and other proposals and will
strive to reflect student opinion
rather than influence it. (I almost
used “dictate,” but that is a little
too strong, though only a little.)

I hope the EC will try to serve
the best interests of the student body
rather than that of tradition or per-
sonal views. With the lack, un-
fortunately, of a student senate, the
EC members must be representa-
tives of student views and not let
their personal prejudices rule them
in such situations.

Perhaps the best thing in the film
was Phillip Alford’s performance.

Alford portrays Jem, Scout’s brother, |

and he is exactly right. In his first

performance in movies, Alford un-|

derplays his role with an insight ex-
pected from only an accomplished
actor. Admittedly, Mulligan should
probably be given much credit in
effecting Alford’s disposition; none-
the less, I feel tht he may be
natural actor.

is complete without a jealous wife
(Carolyn Bing), and her sharp
tongue coupled with her husband's
wit provides a chance for some fine
acting.

All in all the play was very en-
tertaining, and judging from the
audience’s applause, very well re-
i ceived. It was the type of play where,
|no matter how small or how large
| their part may have been, the entire

cast set out to please you, and the

result was an excellent perform-
; ance by all.
| “Krapp’s Last Tape,” directed by

Andrew E. Adelson, belongs, in his
| words, “to a recently developed
‘genre of drama termed ‘theatre of
{the absurd’ or ‘metatheatre.’ The
plays of Beckett are unique in that
they all concentrate on the same
subject: the passage of time and its
effects upon man,

Nowhere in Beckett is this idea
of lost time more emphatic than in
Krapp’s Last Tape. The solitary
Krapp plays a tape of his thirty-
ninth birthday, and the only thing
that interests him is a description
of love-making in a punt. Apart
from this, he finds no common
ground with his younger self. What
is the difference between the older
and younger Krapp? It is a dic-
hotomy affected by the passage of
time; it is time which prevents the
individual from every fully recaptur-
ing past evperience.”

Krapp is portrayed by Steve Col-
vin, and I have to admit that I
have never seen anyone peel and
eat a banana with as much relish
and as much zeal as he does. Colvin
was handicapped by the fact that his
performance was the second of the
evening, and after Giraudoux’s light
satire it was difficult at first to ad-
just one’s thoughts to the intensity
and subtle implications which mark
a play by Beckett. Yet, as the play
progressed, it became obvious that
the audience was at last receptive,
and Mr. Colvin’s role took on much
more meaning. His ability to trans-
mit an air of antiquity brought life
to the play, and it, too, was appre-
ciated greatly by the audience.

A Mixed Opinion Among

idea might be the right one, but I
think we need to discuss it more and
maybe come up with some other
ideas, too.

A freshman favored the proposal,
adding tht he didn’t “like the idea
of the EC saying they can’t make
a mistake and that every violation
is just as bad as every other. Isn’t
that what they are saying now?”

A lot of students opposed to the
proposal said they felt it would
weaken the Honor System.

Said on senior:

“Sure the Honor System isn’t per-
fect; it’s got flaws like every other
human institution. But why take a
chance on losing a system that
works—and really works—just for

the sake of an isolated few guys? I;
think that 99 per cent of the students |

benefit immeasurably from the re-
sponsibility of living under an abso-

lute, demanding system like ours. It!

strengthens most people; even if at
first they obey it out of fear, they
learn after a while that obedience to
the system improves their character,
increases their self-respect, and gives
them all kinds of freedom. Then the
fear is replaced by something else—
awe, maybe. If it is really a fear
system, nobody could live under it
for four years and not either disobey
or go crazy.

“No, we aren’t going to get a per-
fect system, so let’s keep what we've
got. It’s pretty damn good as it is.”

There was generall agreement on
the fact that the issue should be con-
tinued. A few students suggested
a student body vote, but most of
them felt the issue hadn’t been ex-
plored fully enough yet. “Later I
think a vote would be a good idea;
now nobody’s really thought about it
enough,” commented one junior.

Baseball competition started at 10

For the spectator whose athletic

W&L enters competition with a
slight advantage, having won earlier
the football championship. The Bat-

At any rate, competition will be

the day’s longest as the score ran to
9-9. The Wahoos took the next two
games and won the set 11-9. With
the third set going to Virginia 6-2,
W&L lost the event and the match.
Forrest Dickinson and Jim Mell de-
feated Virginia's Gilivete and Wat-

Generals had already lost the match.
This was the third loss for the
tennis squad, bringing the season
record to 5-3, with one game rained
out. the squad will carry this rec-
ord into the CAC tournament today.
The tennis matches in the tourna-

the greatest spectator interest will be
j that of Washington University of

at W&L have been looking forward

of Miss Carol Hanks, one of the
country’s best, but at Washington
she rates no better than fourth on
the squad. If this is any indication
of the quality of tennis to be played
today and tomorrow, the tournament
should prove exciting. At the con-
clusion of play the individual awards
will be presented as well as a trophy
for the team champion.

Democrats
Form Club

A Young Democrats Club has
been organized at Washington and
Lee and has obtained a charter from
the national Democratic organization
within the past few weeks.

Al Eckes, junior, is president of
the new club, which has held three
meetings to date.

Other officers are Steve Smith,
vice president; Sam Frazier, sec-
retary; and Mike Hayslip, treasurer.
All are charter members of the W&L
Young Democrats.

The new group is expected, ac-
cording to its members, to give
some competition to the strong
Washington and Lee Young Repub-
lican outfit.

Formation of this club practically
completes the political picture at
W&L, since there were last year
the Young Republicans and the Con-
servative Society, and this year has
seen ‘the start of a Non-Conservative
group of more liberal students.

The Young Democrats, says Eckes,
are not at the present time taking
cither a conservative or a_ liberal
stand, due to the fact that their
membership represents many
streams of political thought. The
W&L Young Republicans have been
markedly conservative, and conser-
vatism has seemed to be the strong-
est political feeling at the university
in recent years.

A committee of the club is now
at work to propose a_ constitution
to guide future clubs. Pete Straub,
a law student, is chairman of the
constitutional committee.

Eckes announced that anyone
wishing to join or obtain informa-
tion concerning the Young Demo-
crats, should see him or one of the
other officers. The charter member-

 

ship of the organization is 20.

Two W&L seniors, Jim Campbell |
and John Refo, have recently been
awarded scholarships for the gradu-
ate study abroad under the Fulbright
Program, of which Dr. C. W. Turner
is the University advisor. Both stu-
dents will study in Germany next
winter, following an eight week ori-
entation course.

Jim Campbell, from St. Petersburg,
Florida, will study at the University
of Erlange. Jim is a Dean’s List
student and has held the Elizabeth

erature at Columbia University, and
he has been on the Johns Hopkins
faculty since 1941.

Distinguished Author
Dr. Anderson is a distinguished
ing written a number of books con-
cerning American authors. Included
in his works are: Journal of a Cruise
in the Frigate United States, Mel-
ville in the South Seas, and Emily
Dickinson's Poetry: Stairway of

His work in Germany will be a
continuation of that on his Honors
Thesis, which is about the German
novelist Gustav Meyrink. He also
plans to study the Romantic Period
of German Literature in general to
add to his knowledge of Meyrink’s
literary background and to see how
that novelist’s concerns are reflected
in the work of other writers of the
time. After his stay in Germany
Jim plans to work for his Doctor-
ate at UNC.

Refo will study at the Uni-
of Bohn. John is a member
Eta Sigma, and Phi Beta
Kappa, and has held several schol-
arships, including a Robert E. Lee
Scholarship. In addition, he has been
president of his fraternity, is the

Names Initiates

The W&L Chapter of Beta Gam-
ma Sigma held a_ joint initiation
and banquet with the Chapter at
the University of Virginia on the
evening of Friday, May 10. The
meeting was held at the Pantops
Restaurant, near Charlottesville.

Four students, two member of the
faculty, and an alumnus of Wash-
ington and Lee were initiated into
the Society, together with five stu-
dents from the University of Vir-
ginia.

Beta Gamma Sigma is the official
Honor Society of the American As-
sociation of Collegiate Schools of
Business. It has chapters only in
universities whose business schools
are accredited by the Association, of
which there are only two in the
state of Virginia.

The purpose of the Society
to encourage and reward scholar-
ship and accomplishment among stu-
dents of commerce and business ad-
ministration, to promote the ad-
vancement of education in the art
and science of business and to fos-
ter integrity in the conduct of busi-
ness operation.

The alumnus initiated as an hon-
orary member Dr. Aubry A.
Houser, of Richmond, who attended
Washington and Lee from 1905 to
1907. Dr. Houser received the M.D.
degree from the Medical College of
Virginia. He practiced medicine in
Richmond from 1913-1950, and he
has fulfilled simultaneously two en-
tirely separate careers in addition.

Since 1930 he has been President of
William Poythress and Company,
of Richmond, one of the few in-
dependent manufacturers of phar-
maceuticals remaining in the United
States. Dr. Houser also has exten-
sive interests in and near Rock-

Trio Formed by Darling

The Rooftop Singers were organ-
ized in the spring of 1962 under the
impetus of Erik Darling of the Weav-
ers, who are the deans of American
folk singing. Darling, an accom-
plished musician and musical direc-
| tor, left the Weavers earlier in 1962.
| Other members of the trio are
Lynne Taylor, an attractive female
| vocalist, and Bill Svanoe, an Ober-
lin College graduate.

Miss Taylor is also an experi-
enced entertainer, having appeared
in nightclubs in Philadelphia , Wash-
|ington, and Atlanta. She has ap-
| peared in acts with such stars as
| Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin.

| Svanoe, the third member of the
| trio, is noted as a guitarist.
The Rooftop singer have made

| popular a unique form of folk music.
| “The songs we sing, in many cases,
| come from what has been called folk
|music, and our music deals with
| aspects of human life on many lev-
els,” they say.

Footnote To Recent Dispute:
Don’t Let Issue Be Clouded

The “tooth and nail” controversy over a recent Honor
System proposal has been a refreshing change from the dull
routine of normalcy and we would like to extend our apprecia-
tion to Mr. Lamb and those who have supported him. They are
helping to fill a very real and noxious vacuum on our campus,
a vacuum which develops when too many people think alike.

As you are well aware, apathy and conformity have always
been a proverbial plague on our little community, and for this
reason we welcome those who have minds of their own. We can
do ourselves no greater harm than to discourage such people.
For criticism and divergence of opinion are healthy anywhere;
for a successful university, they are absolutely essential. This
is especially true when we realize that traditions and values
at W&L are never so fully appreciated as when they are
challenged.

Finally, a word of caution. We trust that no student will per-
mit the tactlessness which certain members of the EC have
recently displayed detract from the stand which they have
taken. Their argument is a strong one and the fervor with which
they are resisting opposition may in the eyes of province be
justifiable.

Where the EC went wrong was in appearing to suppress a
student’s honest opinion. The point is now obvious. Where
you the reader can make an equally drastic mistake is to let
this error prejudice your thinking on the issue at hand. Our
Honor System has served more than any other asset we have
to make this institution the outstanding university it is today.
Consider what is at stake when there is talk of making changes;
on such a critical matter, you can not allow mere whim to in-
fluence your decision, regardless of which side of the issue you
take.

Debate Over Honor System
Shouldn’t Involve Personalities

Dr. Sydney M. B. Coulling wrote in the Ring-tum Phi last
year that “there is a difference between an examination of the
honor system that is useful and an examination of it that is not,
and it has seemed to me that we have not always observed this
distinction.” The present argument over the honor system has,
clearly, grossly neglected this distinction and has devolved from
issues to unwarranted personal attack.

In the Friday Ring-tum Phi an editorial entitled “A La-
ment” charged that the W&L EC has been “burying their
heads in the proverbial sand,” that they “have never seriously
considered the suggestion which they have rejected” (i.e., the
proposal to change the penalty for honor system violations) .
It concluded by saying that ‘“This is sad, for blind men are very
sad indeed.” The accusation that the EC is blind and pre-
judiced, that it has “missed the point of Lamar Lamb’s proposal
altogether,” would be a very serious one—if it could be taken
seriously. It is hard to see how the very writers of the editorial
could take such an idea seriously. It is preposterous to suppose
that the EC hasn’t critically thought about the honor system.
It is even more absurd to suppose that those who disagree with
Lamb’s proposal are “blind” or “unable,” as the editorial
states.

The “Lament” went beyond its accusation of the EC to
attack Lanny Butler personally, stating that he attempted to
remove from the Ring-tum Phi an editorial endorsing the pro-
posed change, which is true. However, Butler acted in his right
as editor of the writers of the editorial, who had been members
of Butler’s Tuesday staff all year, who will be on the Tuesday
staff next year, and who had previously agreed to make edi-
torial policy amenable to Butler’s own views for the remainder
of this year. The “Lament” charges that Butler tried to “‘sup-
press discussion of Lamb’s proposal,” which is false; Butler did
not try to stifle the idea, he tried to keep it from appearing as
editorial policy and would have welcomed its appearance as an
article or letter.

Next it was lamented that Butler tried to have Lamb
removed from the slate of Progressive Party candidates. Every
person who was present at the Progressive clique meeting at
which the proposal was discussed, knows that this statement is
totally false.

Controversy around individuals is dangerous when it is
involved in such a debate as that over the honor system.
If the debate cannot be kept free of what Dr. Coulling calls
“unhelpful criticism,” that which “obscures rather than illumi-
nates,” it ought to be ended.

Student Clarifies Recent Controversy at Corner Grill

The Editor
Dear Sir,

Due to a series of stories told
about my controversy with the pro-
prietor of Corner Grill I would ap-
preciate your publishing this in
order for me to clarify what has
taken place.

Some two weeks ago I was stand-
ing across the street from Corner
Grill talking to two Negro high
school students. The proprietor on
this occasion went to a W&L student
in this establishment and told him
to tell me I should not stand outside
there talking to these Negroes be-
cause a thing like that was not done
around here, and that I should go
some place else.

Another incident occurred after
another foreign student and I were
seen talking to the waitresses in
Corner Grill, both inside and out-
side this establishment. An elderly,
white woman standing by the cash
register said to us while we were
paying her: “You two guys are not
fooling anyone—we know what you
are up to. Just watch your steps!”

Remarks like these are not pleas-
ant ones and the following day I
went to Corner Grill and asked one
of the waitresses if she thought they
would meet any repercussion if we,
the foreign students, told the pro-
prietor how we felt about this. This
waitress had heard what had been
said and was very excited over it.
While she was talking, the proprietor
came by a couple of times and then
told her to get away and stand
somewhere else behind the counter.
An argument between the two fol-
lowed, the proprietor came up to me
and told me to get out and stay
out.

Being a guest in this country, I feel
that I should not demonstrate my
opinion on the racial question. Deep
feelings of human rights and _tra-
dition are involved and I should not
impose upon you my views as I
come from a foreign country. But.
I feel that there is a borderline be-
tween what are my duties as a guest
and what behavior I can justify
to myself. I would fail myself as a
person and a foreign student if I
avoided a certain group of the
American people just because of
what “is done” among a majority.
Many people may dislike my talk-
ing to Negroes and my walking with
them in the street, and disdlike me
for doing these things—it is your
right to dislike what you want—
but I do not believe that I have
violated anybody’s rights or stretch-
ed my own rights through my be-

havior. Nor has this behavior
been demonstrative.
Therefore, I am not going to

change on this point. I intend to go
on associating with whomever I like.

I do not understand the behavior
we have been subject to on the
part of the management of the Cor-
ner Grill. I do not question their
legal right to tell an employee to
a customer and stand in another
place, to fire her and to throw a
customer out, but I cannot see any
justification for their behavior to-
wards a group of human being that
have chosen to associate with one
another.

Some persons associated with this
school are circulating a statement
concerning this controversy. I think
that it is important in this con-
nection to discern between the feel-
ings tht are aroused when a foreign-
er in one’s country is subject to an
extremist behavior and one’s feel-
ings towards the behavior as such.

Allow me to express my regrets
that the only article written by for-
eign students this year in the Wash-
ington and Lee School paper is one
of this kind. What has taken place
is one unpleasant experience among
so many other pleasant ones in this
country

Yours faithfully
JAN-ERIK BERG

Change In Honor System
To Come From Obligation

To the Editor

Dear Sir:

I am certainly in favor of the
proposed changes in the Honor Sys-
tem suggested by Lamar Lamb and
others; in fact, I feel so strongly
about the subject that I should fav-
or no Honor System at all over the
present administration of it.

At the same time, however, I think
it should be pointed out that, de-
spite all the talk about change,
nothing has yet been done; this
means that, as before, every member
of the student body is pledged to
uphold the Honor System as it is
presently administered. I do not
feel, as do some, that we as students
have a right to change the system;
rather, I should insist that we have

 

an obligation to do so. However, un-

 

til such changes occur, I should hope
that each student would act respon-
sibly with respect to his previous
commitment to uphold the system,
thereby enforcing present policy un-
til it is corrected. Unjust though the
law may be, we have a duty either
to uphold it until it is changed, or
else to be prepared to take the con-
sequences for violating it.

Furthermore, I should hope that
all efforts be made to see that
changes in the System are ap-
proached in a rational, orderly. fash-
ion, weighing alternatives and pos-
sible consequences. As a step in this
direction, I would suggest—to keep
down some of the difficulties that
have occurred with respect to the
present discussion—that the Execu-
tive Committee make available to the
student body all records of honor
trials and procedural changes with,
of course all names carefully de-
leted—from as far back as possible
to, say ten years ago; this should
take much of the machinery for
change out of the hands of the EC,
and put it back with the student
body where it belongs.

 

For change in the Honor System
to be effective, it must come from
the student body itself; the EC’s
chief concern should be to enforce
the policies the students themselves
adopt. This puts the burden squarely
on us as students; I hope the in-
terval in the present discussion
caused by exams and summer va-
cation will not cause an apathy or
laxity with regard to this matter.

Sincerely yours,
WILLIAM B. LOWRY, JR.

Student Lauds Jay Taylor
For Contributions To W&L

Dear Editor:

This is not a letter from an angry
man. I think it is time we recog-
nized the contributions of one pro-
fessor who has given so much to
W&L during the past year. The
professor I am referring to is Jay
Laurence Taylor.

All of us are so quick to criticize
that often positive accomplishments
escape us. Mr. Taylor is sincerely

 

 

interested in the student body; he
has done much to contribute to
our education.

Allow me to mention a few of
his accomplishments. Jay Taylor is
the originator and director of ReVue.
Recently when Dwight MacDonald
spoke here he mentioned that he
has never seen such intelligent in-
terest in the film art in any college
in the country except possibly for
Yale, and he added that the W&L
students with whom he had spoken
edged Yale students in actual ac-
quaintance with films. Certainly
much of this enthusiasm for movies
is attributed to the opportunity pro-
vided us by Mr. Taylor.

Mr. MacDonald, one of the lead-
ing movie critics in the country
(Esquire magazine), was persuaded
to come here by Mr. Taylor.

The appearance on our campus of
the noted anthologist and poet, Oscar
Williams, was another contribution
of Mr. Taylor.

Father Henri Laval, a French
Dominican priest, spent a week on
our campus under the auspices of,

Three Proposals Suggested For
Further Academic Improvement

By ROD COCKSHUTT

Washington and Lee’s progress in
the academic sphere over the past
few years has been admirable. And
yet, most of us would agree that
there is still much to be done in
helping this University realize its
goal of true excellence in academic
matters. The purpose of this column,
then, is simply to suggest some pro-
posals which, if implemented, may
be beneficial in achieving that goal.

A. Whitney Griswold, who was,
until his death a few weeks ago,
President of Yale University and

 

one of America’s most articulate
spokesman in the field of higher
education, once said that “Like
law a university is a seamless
web. Anything which helps the
freshman class helps the Uni-
versity.” The truth of this state-
ment has already been acknow-
ledged to a certain extent at
Washington and Lee in the recent
moves to upgrade and liberalize
the freshman curriculum.

Despite the fact that most profes-
sors are sincerely concerned about
the weaker students, an ever-in-

 

Presidential Chances Remote
For Romney, Scranton, Nevitt

(Following is the concluding
half of a series on the presidential
prospects for the 1964 elections.
Last week, Mr. Hyatt, an inter-
mediate law Student, discussed
Rockefeller and Goldwater.

By JAMES HYATT

Where would Rockefeller’s advo-
cates go if he were to actually bow
out of the race? Goldwater? I doubt
it. But how feasible is it to turn
to Romney, Scranton, Hatfield, or
Nevitt? George Romney, the moder-
ate conservative Governor of Mich-
igan offers very little in this writer’s
opinion. Romney did win in a state
which was controlled by Democrats
and “Big Labor” for the past 14
years. But when he put his reputa-
tion on the line over a vote on a
new state constitution, he barely
won the contest.

Specializes in Everybody

Mr. Romney is usually described
as being against big business, big
labor, and big government. He
specializes in everybody. His follow-
ers, he would hope, consist of those
who are willing to put their citizen’s
interest ahead of their private inter-
ests. Needless to say, Romney has
one “plus” factor of belonging to
a minority religion, Mormonism.
And for what it is worth, he is avid
on physical fitness. He has, however,
repeatedly denied all rumors that he
will run. But comments would lead
one to believe otherwise.

Returning to the East, Pennsyl-
vania comes into the picture with
Governor Scranton. Mr. Scranton
has a record to match Kennedy,
Rockefeller, or Goldwater, or so say
his followers. Briefly, he was a one-
term Congressman; special assistant
to Christian A. Herter; he repre-
sented the U.S. at numerous _in-
ternational conferences in Europe,
Latin America, and at U.N. during
the Eisenhower administration. Mr.
Seranton served in World War II as
a flying Captain; graduated from
Yale with a B.A. and LLB. and
happens to be a multi-millionare.
One problem stands in the way:
Seranton doesn’t want the nomina-
tion. However, he is one person to
whom Rockefeller supporters might
well flee in emergencies.

Governor Hatfield, a young man
from Oregon, might also collect some
eastern liberal votes. Hatfield is
known as an intellectual of sorts,
and he has the support of labor!
According to the April Gallop Poll,
he has 8 per cent of the potential
Republican voters on his side.

 

Arthur Nevitt

Arthur G. Nevitt is an unlikely
man for the president but he has
the qualifications. Some supporters
are considering opening campaign
headquarters but they’re not certain
which state to locate it in. Briefly,
Nevitt, who has 1/8 colored blood,
and comes from the state of Illinois,
stands to gain the Southern Negro
vote and the rabid eastern liberal
vote, due to his nebulous location.
Nevitt is a reformed Jew, after hav-
ing spent ten years in the Episcopal
faith. Before that, he was a devout
advocate of Taoism. With such a
sparkling religious past, he should
pick up millions of minority religion
voters. Nevitt, of course, comes from
a wealthy family who made their
money honestly buying up oil-satu-
rated Indian land at pre-war prices.
His family is large due to fact that
we won the custody of his first wife’s
children in divorce court. His second
wife is quite lovely and would make
a perfect “First Lady” all dressed
up in her serape.

A Strong Pragmatist

Mr .Nevitt is very strong on his
political views. This writer has never
met anyone who has matched the
zeal Nevitt displays when it comes
to foreign affairs. He proclaims that
he is a straightforward Pragmatist
who will sway either way. He be-
lieves in sending troops into Viet
Nam, maybe, and the budget should
be slashed by millions, possibly, and
that unemployment would be solved

(Continued on page 4)

 

creasing number of hours spent in
committee meetings, in addition to
the normal professorial work load,
have made the type of personal
help once available almost impos-
sible today.

It is in such a situation that stu-
dents can be of significant help.
Members of the freshman honor
society, Phi Eta Sigma, recognized
for their fine academic ability, do
practically nothing as an organi-
zation on this campus. Why not
put that untapped talent to use in
the establishment of a voluntary
student tutoring service? Much of
the time now spent out of class
by professors explaining funda-
mentals and mechanics could then
be put to other more profitable
use,

The minor details of such a system
could be worked out with little
trouble and the program could be
operable by September. Nor do we
have to restrict it to Phi Eta Sig-
mas. Other interested and qualified
students could also be employed.

A second proposal concerns sem-
inars. A recent editorial in the
Ring-tum Phi cloquently expressed
the desire of a large number of stu-
dents for more seminars especially
in certain departments where there
are either woefully few or none at
all. Perhaps a step in the right di-
rection would be the establishment
of a system where, out of every three
class periods in a particular course,
two would be straight lectures and
the other would be a seminar—dis-
cussion on the material covered
in the lectures. A program similar
to this has proved very successful
at Yale.

Naturally seminars, if done cor-
rectly, mean more work for both
students and professors, but the
educational rewards of such a sys-
tem increase proportionately.

Finally, faculty meetings ought to
be opened for the student body
through the admission of a reporter
from the Ring-tum Phi to such
meetings. Of course, the right of ex-
ecutive session must be maintained
for the discussion of confidential
matters. But through opening these
meetings, student-faculty under-
standing could possibly be greatly
increased, and the unfortunate ru-
mors which occasionally arise from
closed sessions could be eliminated.

The CAC Way

The first annual spring College Athletic Conference tour-
nament was indeed a successful event and a step in the right
direction for athletics on this campus. It was good to see a
whole weekend directed for W&L devoted to an athletic tourna-
ment of this type, involving athletes from four other schools.
The large turnout on the part of the students and townspeople
in support of our athletes was also indicative of the great suc-
cess of the weekend. Washington University of St. Louis did
extremely well here. It is a larger school than W&L and has a
fine group of athletes. Washington and Lee lost the overall
trophy by only five points and the closeness of the competition
indicates it could have easily gone the other way. Next year
when the tournament is held at Centre College in Danville,
Kentucky, the competition will be even tougher, and hopefully

WeL will be the winner.

Battling Bears Grab Track

 

By DON CASTO

Washington and Lee trackmen
finished a strong third in last Satur-
day’s CAC finals. The thinclads ac-
cumulated a total of fifty-two points
while second place Sewanee had
sixty-two and top ranking Washing-
ton Universitl had eighty-five. Al-
though the Generals only captured
two first places, they made up for
this with superior depth. Hardly an
event passed in which the Generals
did not place a man.

Tommy Edwards and Robin Kell
were the two gold medal winners
for Washington and Lee. Edwards
won the broad jump with a leap of
twenty-one feet, six and three-
quarters inches. In that same event
Henry Sackett jumped twenty-one
feet in the preliminaries to set a
new meet record. The jumps in the
finals could not be counted towards
a record because the wind was too
great. Robin Kell won his gold
medal in the triple jump as he
bounded to a new meet record of
forty-three feet, six inches. He also
placed fourth in the high jump.

Freshman Scott Kennedy placed
second close behind Kell in the
triple jump and also captured a fifth
place in the javelin throw. In other
field events Dave Britt threw the
discus one hundred thirty-two feet,
two inches to take second in that
event; and captain Dave Munroe
captured fifth. Munroe also placed
second in the shot put.

Mac Brownlee won second place
laurels in a close mile race and came
back shortly thereafter to capture a
third place in the two mile run and
a fifth in the half mile run. Andy

Led by the hitting of Bob Benben
and the clutch pitching of Tom
Eckleman, and aided by eight W&L
errors, Washington University over-
whelmed Washington and Lee, 13-3
in the CAC championship baseball
game Saturday afternoon.

Benben paced the Bears’ 16-hit at-
tack with four hits and four RBIs,
while Eckleman allowed two runs
and spaced ten General hits over
eight innings. Eric Sisler led the
Washington and Lee hitters with
three safeties to end the season with
a team-leading .431 batting average.

Washington U. scored three runs
in the second inning on a W&L

three-base error with men on second |

and third, and added two more
in the fourth stanza. The Generals
then came back to make the score
5-2, but the St. Louisians put the
game out of reach with three more
tallies in their half of the fifth.

The Generals earned a berth in
the final game by downing Sewanee
Friday night, 9-3. Southpaw Chris
Wigert spaced eight Sewanee hits
and fanned eleven men to capture
his fifth win, while aiding his own
cause by driving in three tallies.

With the game tied, 2-2, in the
fifth, the Generals unloaded with
six runs. Aside from Wigert’s key
hit during this rally, Howie Martin
and Ashley Allen also singled and
later scored.

In the opening tournament game,
Sewanee scored two key runs in
the eighth inning to edge Southwest-
ern, 8-6. Al Sherer picked up the
win in relief as Frank Stubblefield
led the Southerner’s attack with
two hits and three RBI’s.

Southwestern came back in the
semi-final game to top Sewanee,
9-4, for third place in the final base-
ball standings. The Lynx went
ahead 5-3 with two runs in the sec-
ond inning and were never in trouble
again.

Third baseman Fritz Anthon hit
two home-runs to drive in all six of
Washington University runs, as the
Bears downed Centre College Fri-

day, 6-4. Although outhit 10-7,
Washington U. managed to bunch

TILL WE MEET AGAIN

With today’ s installment I complete my ninth year of writing
columns in your college newspaper for the makers of Marlboro
Cigarettes. In view of the occasion, I hope I may be forgiven
if I get a little misty.

These nine years have passed like nine minutes. In fact,
I would not believe that so much time has gone by except that
I have my wife nearby as a handy reference. When I started
columning for Marlboros, she was a slip of a girl—supple as a
reed and fair as the sunrise. Today she is gnarled, lumpy, and
given to biting the postman. Still, I count myself lucky. Most
of my friends who were married at the same time have wives
who chase cars all day. I myself have never had this trouble
and I attribute my good fortune to the fact that I have never
struck my wife with my hand. I have always used a folded

newspaper—even throughout the prolonged newspaper strike
in New York. During this period I had the airmail edition of
the Manchester Guardian flown in daily from England. I must
confess, however, that it was not entirely satisfactory. The air-
mail edition of the Guardian is printed on paper so light and
flimsy that it makes little or no impression when one slaps one’s
wife. Mine, in fact, thought it was some kind of game, and tore
several pairs of my trousers.

But I digress. I was saying what a pleasure it has been to
write this column for the last nine years for the makers of
Marlboro Cigarettes—a fine group of men, as anyone who has
sampled their wares would suspect. They are as mellow as the
aged tobaccos they blend. They are as pure as the white cellulose
filter they have devised. They are loyal, true, companionable,
and constant, and I have never for an instant wavered in my
belief that some day they will pay me for these last nine years.

Sut working for the makers of Marlboro has not been the
greatest of my pleasures over the last nine years. The chief
satisfaction has been writing for you—the college population
of America. It is a rare and lucky columnist who can find an
audience so full of intelligence and verve. I would like very
much to show my appreciation by asking you all over to my
house for tea and oatmeal cookies, but there is no telling how
many of you my wife would bite.

For many of you this is the last year of coilege. This is espe-
cially true for seniors. To those I extend my heartfelt wishes
that you will find the world outside a happy valley. To juniors
I extend my heartfelt wishes that you will become seniors. To
sophomores I extend my heartfelt wishes that you will become
juniors. To freshmen I extend my heartfelt wishes that you will
become sophomores. To those of you going on into graduate
school I extend my heartfelt wishes that you will marry money.

To all of you let me say one thing: during the year I have
been frivolous and funny during the past year—possibly less
often than I have imagined—but the time has now come for
some serious talk. Whatever your status, whatever your plans,
I hope that success will attend your ventures.

We, the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes, confess to more than

add our good wishes to Old Max’s: stay happy; stay loose.

A Poet Relates Features Of Spring

By BILL KINSEY

Where now the Bacchanalia? We
who possess such an amazing amount
of folklore and tradition about the
springtime have let it all slip
through our fingers, to fall forgot-
ten in the dim light of the centuries,
while we content ourselves with
watered-down versions of what
were once spectacles worth behold-
ing. What a poor heritage we have
preserved from the past!

The poet sings of the return of the
daffodils, the buds of May, fluffy
clouds, ete., but the poet is the last
of a breed. He is the only one left
who sings of the coming of spring.
And who should sing of springtime?
Why, the youth of our land, of
course! But where are our youth?
They are confined to cramped and
stifling classrooms in colleges all
across the land—that’s where! Their
natural desires thwarted, they are
forced to listen to this or that pro-
fessor droning on about this or that
minor subject which has absolutely
nothing whatsoever to do with the
season at hand.

Youth is not to be put down com-
pletely however. As surely as the
season returns, so too will other
things. What student’s heart does
not warm when, with the first balmy
day, he sights a kite dancing high
in the spring air? What college man
does not tremble with concealed ex-
citement as he stalks his classmate
with water pistol well-loaded? Is
there a student anywhere who does
not love the solid feel of a well-
built yo-yo tight in his palm? And
everywhere at this time of year,
one finds knots of students on hands
and knees playing at marbles, coats
and ties and books forgotten beside
them.

But these games are mere substi-
tutes. They are the student’s way of
ratifying desires which have been
squelched by the academy in which
he finds himself. Should the student
be content with this? No.

Let the academy be the student’s

By PETE ALFORD

There have been many words
written and spoken recently about
Lamar Lamb’s proposal concerning |
the Honor System. There have been
attacks and counter-attacks, charges
of ruining our cherished traditions,
charges of stiffling the free press and
other general rumblings.

Ventilate Like the British

What each individual must do is
to weigh the merits and weak points
of Lamb’s suggestion and reach a de-
cision. The role of the press should
be to air, or “ventilate” as the
British say, the entire issue and pre-
sent different points of view on the
matter.

We should refrain from charging
individuals with this or that, but
rather should examine the proposal
itself and the merits or demerits
of its construction.

Student Apathy

A recent article in one of the
national magazines described stu-
dent riots at Brown, Princeton, and
Yale. Whenever we read about this
or whenever the freshmen here
make noise in the dining hall there
are always those who question why
we never have a riot. Are we apa-
thetic? Are we content? Do we avoid
causes? We don’t care at all?

Regardless of which answer is cor-
rect, if indeed one is correct, the
students of Washington and Lee are
for several reasons out of touch
with students elsewhere. We are
not aware of what people are think-
ing about at Vanderbilt, Yale, Stan-
ford, ete. or how they are meet-

EC Appoints Sharp

To Plan Convention

Intermediate Law Student To Head
Colorful Mock Political Convention

By DAVID MARCHESE
Staff Reporter

The Executive Committee recently
appointed Philip D. Sharp, Jr., an
intermediate law student, as chair-
man of the 1964 Mock Convention.
This is the thirteenth political con-
vention staged by Washington and
Lee students since 1908. The general
purpose of the convention is an at-
tempt to guess the next presidential
candidate for the party out of office,
in this case, the Republican Party.

As the mock balloting is done
prior to the party’s summer national
convention, Sharp is planning a late
April or early May date for the
convention here.

A contributor to the Law Review,
Sharp is a 1962 graduate of Wash-

ington and Lee and a member of |

Who’s Who in American Colleges.

This year he has served as head |\

dorm councilor and was recently ap-
pointed to the Student Control Com-
mittee. Sharp is quoted as saying he
is deeply gratified for his selection
as chairman and hopes that with the
help of the entire student body, the
1964 convention will be the most
successful ever.

He plans to announce a Student

The Executive Committee of the
Student Body met yesterday after-
noon in an Executive Session to

and Lee’s four major committees for
students.

Named as Chairman of the Student
Control Committee for 1963-64 was
Jim Sylvester, Kappa Sigma and un-
successful candidate for senior EC
in the recent class elections. The
law representative on the commit-
tee will be Bob Sykes, and the senior
representative Fred Schaffer, jun-
ior—Joe Wheeler, and sophomore
representative, Peter Kintz. Two
Committeemen at large were select:
ed Kemp Morton and Al Eckes.

Assimilation Committee members,
numbering nine in all, were also
chosen. Heading up the committee
will be Jim Maffit, and those serving
under him will be: Fred Cooper, Tom
Pace, Bill Surbaugh, Vic Galef, Greg
Euston, Mike Hayslip, Chuck Griffin,
and Chip Day.

The Cold Check Committee to be
headed by Barry Greene, will be
made up of the following students:
Mack Brownlee, Jim Slay, Shannon
Jung, Alex Taft, Drew Baur, and
Scott Kennedy.

Heading the Student Library Com-
mittee will be Steve Parel. Serving
as committee members will be: Tim
Dols, Mike Levin, Mel Lapes, Walter
Bennett, Tabor Novak, and Wes
Horner.

Controversy Develops Ove Firing Of Wolsiose
Students Claim Freedom Of Association Violated

One week ago today a waitress
employed by the Corner Grill at
the intersection of Lee Avenue and
W. Nelson Street was dscharged
and a W&L student Eric Berg, was
asked to remain off the premises
for the rest of his stay here.

Berg has stated that Doc, proprie-
tor of the Corner Grill, sent someone
to tell him, after he was seen con-
versing with three Negro girls across
the street, ‘that “you don’t do that
in the South.” The next afternoon,
Berg went into Doc’s, and while
talking with a waitress, asked her if
she thought Doc would object to his
telling his feelings about what had
happened the preceding day.

Argument Develops

While Berg was talking with the
waitress, Doe asked the waitress to
stand elsewhere behind the counter.
An argument followed between the
waitress and Doc, after which he
discharged her and asked Berg to
get out and stay out of his estab-
lishment.

In 1956, the Washington and Lee
convention attracted nation-wide
attention when its keynote speaker,
Senator Alben W. Barkley, collapsed
and died of a heart attack at the
close of his keynote address at Dore-
mus Gymnasium. A plaque was
dedicated at the 1960 Convention in
memory of the Senator from Ken-
tucky.

The convention is exclusively a
student affair from its early planning
to its actual running. It lasts for two
days with a colorful opening parade
which features floats from the state
delegations, bands and marching
units. Another incentive that adds
to the political fervor is the suspen-
sion of University classes for the
two-day run of the Convention.

 

There will be a meeting of the
Publications Board Monday, May
20, at 5 p.m, in the Student Union.
It will be the last meeting for the
current year. Salaries must be
coted upon, and final votes taken
on measures brought up at the last

As a result of this event, a state-
ment that has been called a “spon-
taneous reaction of the student body
and faculty,” has been circulating
and has over 300 signatures. The

statement is a “voluntary” pledge
not to associate with the business
establishment run by Doc.

Doc Interviewed
In an interview last Monday with

Doc, he stated that the firing of
the waitress came as a result of

her spending too much time talk-
ing with customers, especially Berg,
and that it was not due to any other
reasons. He stated that his wife had
complained that Berg had talked
with the waitress for 45 minutes on
Thursday and that it was interferring
with her work. He stated that he did
not object to anything that went on
between the waitress and Berg out-
side the Grill, but that when she
was there he wanted her to work.

Doc did say that he remarked to
someone near the front of the Grill,
when he saw Eric talking to the

Waysiders To Sing June 4
In ‘Rooftop Singers’ Concert

By KEN McGRAW

Joining the “Rooftop Singers” for
a half hour performance in the Tues-
day night concert of Finals, will be
the “Waysiders” of Washington and
Lee University. The announcement
was made this week by Dance Board
President Frank Young.

The Waysiders, made up of Jim
Ledbetter, a Phi Gam sophomore
from Alexandria, and Dave Trussel,
a Phi Delt sophomore from Balti-
more, are a folksinging group mod-
eled somewhat after “Gibson and
Camp” and “Jan and Sylvia,” two
well known folksinging duos. The
songs which the Waysiders sing,
however, are original. Ledbetter has
written some of them himself.

Ledbetter and Trussel began sing-

ing together back in January. They
made their first appearances at the
College Inn, and since then have
proved to be very popular. In ad-
dition to singing at fraternity houses
and local girls’ schools, the Way-
siders have appeared at the Gaslight
in Roanoke, and at Le Flambeau and
The Blue Dog Cellar in Baltimore.
They plan to continue singing this
summer and already have engage-
ments in Ocean City, Philadelphia,
and Baltimore.

Before getting together as the
Waysiders, Ledbetter and Trussel
did a good bit of singing on their
own. Ledbetter sang with a group
last summer at The Shadows in
Georgetown, and Trussel was a
member of the Sazeracks.

“Somebody should tell him that you
don’t do that in the South.” Doc
also stated that he had heard ru-
mors that the colored people were

going to beat him (Eric) up and
that he (Doc) didn’t want any
trouble.

Freedom of Association

Eric and the signers of the state-
ment object to what they feel was
an attempt by Doe to interfere with
“freedom of association” as it was
used by Berg. They feel that the
firing of the waitress came to a great
extent because of Berg’s conversa-
tions with the Negro girls.

Doc, on the contrary, stated that
the sole reason for the girl's dis-
charge was her neglection of her
work. He stated that he has not
noticed any change in business as a
result of the statement. He added}
that his “business is students” and}
that “he would not do anything to |
hurt them.” \

W&L To Lose :
Three Profs
Next Year

By ROBERT POTTS
Several members of the Washing-
ton and Lee faculty have announced
that they will not be returning to
the University with the end of this
academic session.
Associate Professor of Political

Science Dr. Allen E. Ragan, who

came to W&L in 1946 from Tus-
culum College in Greenville, Ten-
nessee, is retiring at the age of sixty-
five. He will, however, continue to
teach at East Kentucky State Col-
lege in Richmond, Kentucky.

Dr. Ragan recently published an

Assistant Professor of History C.
O. Smith is leaving Washington and

European History at Drexel Institute
of Technology in Philadelphia, Pa.
Mr. Smith stated that his stay here
had been rewarding in that, “I’ve
had enough good students to make
my efforts as a teacher worthwhile.”
Prior to coming to W&L, Mr. Smith
was an instructor at M.LT. in Hu-
manities.

Jay Laurence Taylor, Instructor
in Romance Languages, announced
that he would be returning to New
York University at the end of this
year. It was at N.Y.U. that Mr.
Taylor received his B.A. degree
which he followed up with graduate
studies at the University of Paris
and Vienna. “As a tenth generation
Virginian, it was fun to have finally
lived in Virginia,” he said, speaking
however, in only one of the twelve
languages at his command.

Award Presented

to have this money given to the
Department of English for use in
the Moffatt Seminar Room. The
money was awarded in the name of
Theodore Thompson, Jr., a recently
deceased fraternity brother of Rains,
and was received for the English
Department by Dr. Severn Duvall.

Dean Gilliam gave Rains the
award: a plaque and check. There
will also be a plaque hung in the

Chancellor of the University, be-
gan the program with an invoca-
tion.

President Fred C. Cole then gave
a short ten minute address to the
graduating seniors, pointing out the
fact that he had come to Washing-
ton and Lee at the same time they
had. He added that he had benefitted
a great deal from his associations

Both Dave Montgomery and Paul
Boswell gave responses to President
Cole’s speech, thanking him for his
outstanding job of administrating
the school.

Next on the program was the
presentation of the Gilliam Award
and then Mr. William C. Washburn,
Executive Secretary of the Alumni
Association gave the seniors a short
sketch of the workings and purpose
of the Alumni Association.

Mr. Washburn, who is officially in
charge of the banquet and the Board
of Trustees of the Alumni Associa-
tion felt that the banquet was a
success in every way. In the past
these banquets have been held at
the Natural Bridge Hotel but the
banquet shifted to the Commons af-

Bridge Hotel a few weeks ago. Plans
for next year have not yet been
made.

As ‘A Search For The Holy Life’

Dr. Charles R. Anderson of The
Johns Hopkins University spoke here
last night on Henry David Thoreau
for the Seminars in Literature pro-
gram.

His lecture, titled “The Magic Cir-
cle of Walden,” will be the basis of a
book he intends to write in the near
future on the 19th century philoso-
pher and social critic.

Dr. Anderson approached Wal-
den as a large poem, giving at-
tention to its language structure,
and symbolism as well as_ its
thought. “The theme of Thoreau’s
masterpiece,” he stated, “is the
search for perfection and the holy
life—though this search is never
in Christian terms.

The structure was explained as
resembling a circle and a web. The
cirele is perfection, and is repre-
sented by many images; the cycle
of the seasons, the cycle of the
day, the flight of birds, and Walden
Pond itself—which is ringed by
other ponds. “There are many radial

 

spokes going out from the circle,”
Dr. Anderson explained; lines of
Thoreau’s wit which leads us from
the center, which man must escape
in finding himself.” The actual struc-
ture of the book was shown to sup-
port this; the chapter entitled “The
Pond,” which contains the heart
of Thoreau’s message, is placed in
the center of the book and is sur-
rounded by chapters that are de-
signed to lead to and away from it.

The most entertaining part of
Dr. Anderson’s lecture was con-
cerned with Thoreau’s wit, which
is often overlooked by the casual
reader. Thoreau was a master of
the pun and of cutting understate-
ment, which he used to render
arguments against his thought
meaningless. “Thoreau is not log-
ical,” he explained, “but just the
opposite. What he wants to say is
not logical, nor could it be pre-
sented in a convincing argument
and retain its meaning.” An ex-

Dr. Jenks looks over the notebooks he compiled in Vienna last summer
doing research on the period before World War I.

Dr. Jenks Recalls Parties
When He Was Student Here

By JIM LEDBETTER

“Next year the twenty-fifth re-
union of my Washington and Lee
graduating class will take place. The
school has changed quite a bit since
I was here—our parties were usually
to the tune of recorded music, and
we would practically bribe stags to
come and cut in on us so we could
dance with other girls.”

Much has happened to Washing-
ton and Lee since Dr. William
Jenks, professor of History, grad-
uated in 1939; but much has hap-
pened to him, too. In World War
II he was a cryptographer, assigned
to decode secret messages, and a
political analyst for the O.S.S.; he
has worked for the State Depart-
ment; traveled to Europe to do
research; and is the author of two
books,

When he graduated from W&L,
Dr. Jenks went to Columbia to
work on his Masters, which he re-
ceived in 1940. When the war started
he was sent to Princeton by the
Army to study Arab culture. “Our
base was in Cairo,” he recalls, “and
messages we worked on were so
secret that we couldn’t even talk
about them to each other—under
penalty of court martial.”

After the war he accepted a job
with the State Department doing
essentially the same type of work
he had been doing in the O.S.S. “I
quit after a year,’ he recalls; “it

Lest We Forget

 

      

aah

Here at Washington and Lee we
are proud of our traditions. They
have served us well and it is our
privilege to guard them for the
short time that we are here, not
our right to question them.

We have been informed that an
ancient tradition, one that served
Washington and Lee for many
years, was somehow allowed to
flounder and be forgotten through
neglect.

The tradition goes like this: the
revered likeness of Cyrus Me-
Cormick, gracing the campus
grounds near Lee Chapel, will be
seen to gently stroke his beard
every time a virgin walks by.

This ancient tradition should
be revived, lest we forget. In case
you are worrying about what
Cyrus has been doing all these
years, don’t—he never forgets.

 

was too bureaucratic, and I didn’t
feel that I was earning my money.”

In 1946 Dr. Jenks came here to
teach, and has remained ever since.
During the summers he continued to
work on his Doctorate, which he re-
ceived in 1949. His thesis was pub-
lished as The Austrian Electorial
Reform of 1907. In 1960 he published
another book Vienna and the Young
Hitler. “I hope the next one comes
out sooner than 1970,” he says, but
you never can tell.”

Last summer Dr. Jenks travelled
to Vienna to do research on that
period in Austrian history just be-
fore World War I. “They tried the
democratic approach for several
years before the war,” he says,
“and, as we know, it failed. I am
interested in finding out why.”
The results of his research are
sitting in his office in a tall pile
of notebooks, waiting to be inter-
preted and incorporated in his
forthcoming book.

Since he is a well-known scholar
both in and out of his field, Dr.
Jenks is a member of several com-
mittees, including the national se-
lection committee for Fulbright
Scholarships which sends students
to Vienna to do research, and the
Chairman of a Southern History
Essay Committee, which judges
graduate papers in this field for
cash awards.

Alas For Liberality!

Dear Sir:

Recently, I have read that stu-
dents at University of Texas and
Indiana University voted to with-
draw from N.S.A. (National Student
Association). In connection with the
publicity which accompanied these
important withdrawals from this
radical organization, I was very glad
to see that Washington and Lee was
listed among 14 colleges which have
rejected NSA affiliation in recent
years.

“Students study more today than|
they did in my undergraduate days,” |
recalls Dr. Jenks, “but somehow the
number of really bright students has
not changed. Two members of my
graduating class are college presi-
dents now. Perhaps I should say
merely that the level of competence
has gone up.”

Critical Method

In this, the last issue of the
Friday edition this year, Tom
Pace, regular movie columnist, is
making an effort to explain the
fact that different people view
movies in different ways.

By TOM PACE

There are several sad things about
good film critics. Aside from the fact
that they are always wrong, they
must present their judgment to a
mass of movie-goers who are not en-
thusiastically in sympathy with the
critics’ interest, that interest being
good films. Because of this, the
moviegoers own uneducated opinion,
there is an abundance of poor film
critics in America.

For some unknown reason, news-
papers seldom acquire critics with
discerning taste. These critics are the
ones who form, or at least help to
form, the mass opinion of a film.
How else does a movie like the
“Music Man” become so popular and
so praised by the man in the street?
This means opinion is the same that
acclaim “Ben Hur,” “Hatari,” and
“Exodus.” You can all admit that
these are not good films, and you
won't hesitate to throw yourself
above that level which appreciate
them.

So there is another level; that is
the level of the somewhat educated,
the almost sophisticated film goer.
This level boos Stanley Kramer

“On the Beach,” and “Inherit the

Phi but did not note any reference
to W&L’s rejection of affiliation, so
I am belatedly congratulating the
student body on their intelligence in
this matter.

It is noted that there have also
been 32 colleges which have with-
drawn from N.S.A. since 1961.

I hope W&L continues to reject
NSA,, which has passed the follow-
ing liberal or “pink” resolutions at
its national conventions:

1. Defense of Japanese student
rioting against Eisenhower.

2. Praise for Fidel Castro’s Educa-
tional Reforms.

3. Recommendation that the House
Committee on Un-American Activ-
ities be abolished.

4, Opposition to loyalty oaths for
students receiving federal loans.

5. Protests against the firing of
communist teachers.

6. Denunciation of U.S. measures
to achieve nuclear superiority.

I hope W&L continues to resist
any liberal, “pink,” or “red” ac-
tivities, whether by students, pro-
fessors, or outsiders.

Yours truly,

CHARLES G. GILMORE

Dear Mr. Gilmore:

The Friday editors appreciate
your continuing interest in W&L,
and only wish more alumni were
as loyal.

As for the school’s rejection of
NSA, however:

We heard about the student
body’s rejecting it, probably from
the same conservative magazine
you did, listing us among 14 other
colleges whose students unani-
mously rejected NSA.

Since we were quite sure we
had not voted either for or against
NSA affiliation, we checked into
the matter. It seems that for the
last several years, the Executive
Committee has done it for us. We

 

understand that this year one in-
dividual spoke for the entire stu-
dent body in rejecting W&L’s
joining the organization with
“pinko” schools,

The rejection was not made
public (by “public” we mean the
student body itself) because the
EC chose not to do so, just as
they had chosen to speak for
1,000 W&L students in rejecting
the proposal.

While we feel sure the students
would have rejected NSA affilia-
tion, they were never given the
opportunity to decide.

This illustrates quite well, Mr.
Gilmore, just how little you have
to worry about liberal activities
at W&L. You can rest assured
that every effort is being made
and will continue to be made to
keep Washington and Lee just as
it was when you, and perhaps
even your grandfather, were here.

THE EDITORS

A Re-Lament

To the Student Body:

At the risk of kicking a very
dead dog, we should like to com-
ment on Steve Smith’s diatribe
against “name calling” in the Honor
System controversy.

While Smith may have inadvert-
ently hit upon a grain of truth here
and there, the body of his editorial
was irresponsible. What we said the
EC and Lanny Butler did, they did.
It’s quite that simple, and every-
thing we said can be proven.

However, we stand on our word
and choose not to enter into a refu-
tration of Smith’s refutation of our
editorial entitled “A Lament.”

If, though, anyone is interested
in knowing what did happen we
shall be glad to talk with him and
explain why we said the things we
did.

Exchange Student Reflects

 

After A Year In America:

By
Raimondo Strassoldo-Graffembergo

The funny thing about going (I do
not mean as a tourist) in a foreign
country is that it gets so difficult to
generalize about it. It is the same old
problem: the more you know, the
less you know.

When I was in Italy my image
of America was quite sharp and well
defined by a set of handy stereotypes.
Now they all went to pieces.

In my case this is too bad, be-
cause my image of America was
completely positive. This is not un-
common in my country, where for a
long time the two main schools of
political thought used to be the
Philo-Americanism and the Philo-
Bolscevism.

I was was Philo-American to the
point to display a crew-cut in a land
of long hair. I thought Americans
are all wealthy, all eager to love
and be loved, and all disinterested
Knights of Freedom & Democracy.
America was my stainless dream-
land. So I apply, get the Fulbright
Scholarship and am sent to the
Washington and Lee Campus.

~~ Chain Reaction

I started to look for that famous
American friendliness, and find a
wall of disinterest, self satisfaction,
apathy. It is a hard blow. If they
are not interested in me, then why
are they paying for me? This nasty
thought starts a chain of reaction
which destroys all my former “good”
stereotypes. Idealism? They are just
as self-interested as any other na-
tion; their national pride is often
pushed to the point of chauvinism.
Knights of Freedom? Their anti-
communism is often just as blind and
irrational and oppressive as Com-
munism itself. Democracy? Just
pretend to be a Negro wanting to
vote in Greenwood, Alabama. Free
Enterprise? Look at American T&T,
and the steel industries. Wealth?
Yes indeed, but look at the slums,
the unemployees and the hillbillies
swarming in Lexington on Saturday
afternoon.

I agree, this is not quite an im-
partial way to look at America. It
is only a natural reaction to all the
rosy dreams I had been taught to
believe in, when I was in Italy.

Not Necessary

Now I laugh at my naiveness, but
I feel betrayed. Was it necessary for
me to get such a shock, at the con-
tact with the American reality? I
do not think so. I have met lots of
exchange students who came back
with an enthusiastic impression of
America, and American friendliness.
I think all my attitude is due to
the feeling of not being particularly
welcome on this campus.

Of course, this is a generalization;
I have met a great many really nice
and friendly people. But very, very
few of them have been interested
in me as the foreign student from
Italy.

 

|A Student’s Images Crumble

Resigned

I have long since resigned to this
lack of interest. No longer I look
at America with the hatred of the
rejected lover, but as an impartial
observer. So I had opportunity to
dismantle also those few negative
stereotypes I used to have. First
of all, “American students do not
work very hard.” I learned the con-
trary, at my own expenses: here
people do work. Second, “Americans
wear large and baggy clothes and
terrible ties.” That is not true, either.
They wear fancy Madras and white
socks. “Their shoes are big and
heavy and strong.” False. As soon
as I got to this country, I bought
a pair of shoes like that, and not
only did I find myself hopelessly out-
moded, but the shoes are already
falling apart. “Their food is terrible.”
Wrong. I am nuts for hot dogs, and
I never ate so much spaghetti as
here.

The list of the wrecked stereotypes
could go on for many columns. As I
said in the beginning, it is inevitable
that when you live in a country for
one year, all the easy generalizations,
for the good and for the bad, do not
hold any more.

What surprises me is that Ameri-
icans, among other things, think that
the coffee here is the best in the
world: the Italians think the same
about their coffee, and probably so
do the Germans, the French, and
every other nation. I can’t judge,
since I am not a coffee drinker.

Contradictions

Another thing that took me com-
pletely off-guard is that at the
combo parties you are supposed to
look as informal as if you just
jumped out of bed; that slow, soft
dances are almost unknown; that
everybody has to get drunk at least
once a week; that there is such a
nice range of “entertainment for
men” magazines; that all college
girls dress alike; that there are so
many young men men interested in
religion and _ theology; and_ so
on. There are so many different,
contradictory things that could be
said, that no generalization is pos-
sible; and I know but a narrow
geographical strip, and a very thin
social stratum.

Human Beings

I tremble, thinking to all that
future questioning, “Well, how does
America look like?” There is no
way to put my impressions in a
single sentence. All I shall be able
to say is that America is a big
place, inhabited by Americans, each
of whom is just a human being; each
of whom is no better, no worse than
any other human being.

In other words, Americans are not
different than the rest of mankind.
What is different are the traditions,
the habits, and the customs. And,
of course, the amount of money and
power they hold.

Upcoming Underclassmen
Help To Provide Spirit

By CHARLIE SWEET

For the past week under the guid-
ance of Coach Joe Lyles and As-
sistant Coach Bob Lathrop, former
Washington and Lee soccer star and
now law student, the Generals’
soccer team has been practicing.
Coach Joe Lyles expects to culmi-
nate this week of drills with a reg-
ular game today.

a

Game Today

It is expected to be an Alumni
game if last year’s Co-captains Bob
Pagano and Tommy Clements can
come up with enough men. Coach
Lyles feels this game will give him
a good chance to look at next year’s
prospects and a fair indication of
how Washington and Lee’s chances
will be next year. Last year the
General booters finished the season
with a 7-4-2 slate, and copped third
place in the Virginia State Soccer
tournament.

Squad Promising

And the chances for next year—
Coach Lyles feels they are fairly
good for one of the best seasons
ever. Absent only are the two cap-
tains, Pagano and Clements. The |
squad will be bolstered by the re-|

return of four rising juniors, all
lettermen and_ starters, including
inside left Charlie Sweet, outside

left Howie Busse, right fullback Eb
Warner, and left halfback Bruce
Jackson. The two returning rising
seniors are the co-captains for the
1963 campaign Jim Mell and Tom
Greene. Mell plays at either inside
or wing and was the teams leading
scorer last year, while Greene, a
former all - tournament — selection,
protects the goal. Also returning
after a year of ineligibility are rising
juniors Pete Preston and Chris
Clark. So with the return of these
two, and eleven returning lettermen,
and only two rising seniors, the*
chances for next year seem rather
yood. If next year is not the year,
the team certainly boasts a fine
chance for the following year.

game against Fort Lee scheduled,
before the booters officially open

McDaniel Sports Star Of Week;
Called One Of Top Ten In U.S.

The biggest supprises do not al-}
ways come in the biggest packages,
nor are the best athletes necessari-
ly the biggest. |

And, Washington and Lee Univer- |

sity junior John McDaniel certainly | has made John a first rate lacrosse |

fits that description. He stands only |
5-7 and weighs 160 pounds, but he’s |
a top-notch lacrosse and football |
player.

W&L lacrosse coach Bob McHenry
calls McDaniel “one of the 10 best
midfielders in the country,” and
football coach Lee McLaughlin de-
seribes him as “an excellent quarter-
back.”

Lacrosse, however, seems to be
McDaniel’s best sport. From his mid-
field position, he has led the W&L

squad to wins over Duke, North
Carolina and Towson State this
year.

His biggest test comes this Satur-

rival and lacrosse power, the Uni-
versity of Virginia, at Charlottes-
ville. That game will mark the close
of the Generals’ 6-3 season.

McDaniel has scored in all nine
of W&L’s games this year, but his
total production is lower than 1962
because “all of W&L’s opponents are |
ganging up on him.”

For nine games, the hustling mid-
fielder has 11 goals and 10 assists
to his credit.

McDaniel had never played la-
crosse before coming to Washington
and Lee in 1960. He did, however,

come from a lacrosse background—
his father, Dr. Joseph McDaniel, was
an All-American attackman for
Johns Hopkins.

“Hard work and love of the game

player,’ McHenry said. “He’s such a
hard worker that he always comes
to practice anywhere from
minutes early to work on his stick
work.”

What

McDaniel lacks in size, he

makes up in aggressiveness, compe- |

tiveness and ability. He keeps him-
self in such good physical condition
that besides his first midfield berth,
he plays attack when the third mid-
field is in the game.

McDaniel’s biggest assct is his cut-
ting ability.

“He can go with either
quickly and easily. He has very fast
stick control and can guide the
ball into the goal perfectly,” Me-
Henry said.

McDaniel’s control of ground balls
and his dodging ability are two other
important factors which account for
his excellence.

Against Duke McDaniel executed
three different dodges and faked the
goalie to score the second of his

three goals, as he paced W&L to a}

9-3 win.

Hard work, desire and determina-
tion have made John McDaniel a
constant threat in any lacrosse
game—a threat about which W&L’s
opponents really have to worry.

The Washington and Lee tennis
team has just completed a fine 5-3
season. One game, the match with
Colgate was rained out.

In their first match, the Generals
dropped a tough one to the Tigers
of Hampden-Sydney, 5-4. Victory
hinged on the first doubles match
between Captain John Baker and
Jim DeYoung and Hatcher and
Heieleg of Hampden-Sydney. The
Tigers defeated the Generals in a
hard fought match ending in a
score of 10-8,7-5. In the match Baker
won his singles match as did Mell
‘and Short.

; soundly trounced Georgetown Uni-

his pleasure in the younger mem-

After the Lynchburg game, the

Against George Washington, the
Generals suffered some bad luck and

had to be called off. Enough of the
match was played to find the team

21 Regional Newspapers
Contribute To Wire Fund

Twenty-one Virginia and Wash-/|
ington, D.C., daily newspapers, a/
Virginia radio station and a broad-
casters’ association have made con-
tributions to the Frank Fuller Wire
Fund of the Lee Memorial Journal-
ism Foundation at Washington and
Lee University.

Prof. O. W. Riegel, director of the
foundation and head of the uni-
versity’s department of journalism
and communications, listed the con-
tributors in an announcement today.

The wire fund is providing Wash-
ington and Lee students with the
full teletype news services of the
Associated Press for the current aca-
demic year. Journalism students use
the AP news reports in copy-editing
and page layout classes, while others
use the service in preparing a night-
ly newscast over Lexington radio
station WREL. The teletype re-
ceiver is located in the journalism
library at Washington and Lee.

The Frank Fuller Wire Fund was
established in 1951 by the late Vir-
ginia editor and historian, Douglas
Southall Freeman, to honor the vet-
eran chief of the Richmond AP
Bureau. Shields Johnson, vice pres-
ident and general manager of the
Times-World Corp. in Roanoke, so-
licited the contributions to the fund
this year. He also is a visiting lec-
turer in journalism at Washington
and Lee.

Contributors for the 1963-64 fund
include the Charlottesville Daily
Progress, The Danville Register and
Bee, the Fredericksburg Free Lance-
Star and raido station WFLS, the
Harrisonburg News-Record, the
Lynchburg News and Daily Advance,
the Newport News Daily Press and

Free access to information—the
problem of denial of news—is the
problem which should be of basic
concern to the public, not “news
management,” Congressman John E,.
Moss (D. Calif.) said recently.

Speaking to SIPA delegates in Do-
remus Gymnasium Moss said, “news
management is inherent in the hand-
ling of any item of information.
When a reporter writes a story or
an editor places it, the news has
been managed.

“If we must fight the battle for
full access with the battle cry of
news management, I am certain
we are foredoomed to failure...
(it) is too difficult to define.” he
said.

Moss, who is chairman of the For-
eign Operations and Government

Information Subcommitte, said that
the real battle lies in free access
to government officials and to gov-
ernment information—to the facts
themselves.

During the past eight years Moss

has become known for his fight for
information. He has been responsible
for the opening of many closed chan-
nels of information. During those
years he said “we found that in the
main government tries sincerely to
keep the public informed” but even
so access is still limited.
“Tt is important to know what re-
strictions are imposed on such ac-
cess, and why. And it is important to
resist all efforts to narrow access
to knowledgeable officials.”

Moss went on to question the
use of security stamps by bureau-
cratic offices. Are these stamps
“placed there because of the real
needs of this nation for greater
security or for some other reason?

Are they put there “because the
information, if it became known,
might involve the agency in contro-

versy? After all, controversy is
healthy for a democratic society.
Controversy is not a valid reason for
withholding information,” he said.

The State Department, Moss re-

ported, is about to abolish one of
its special secrecy stamps. As of
Wednesday the “Official Use Only”
stamp will no longer be used.

This stamp is one of two special
restrictive classifications that the
State Department, like other gov-
ernmental agencies, has developed
outside those listed in the President’s
Executive Order 10501. The other is
“Limited Official Use” which the
Congressman termed “an obvious
duplication.”

This move Moss said should “help
end some of the confusion which
surrounds the system for protect-
ing information vital to the national
security. At the same time it will
save many thousands of dollars now
spent to protect documents which
really do not need protection.”
Another excuse often given for
the classifications is the prevention of
leaks, Moss said. If “someone in
government utilizes a friendly re-
porter to manage the news” this can’t
be stopped. But if he leaks properly
classified information “the govern-
ment has authority to take action
against that official... not against the
reporter who printed the leaked
facts.”

Moss went on to point out that
the problem of news management
and free access were not new nor
were they more acute now than in
past years. In fact, “In the past our
free press has paid the price of
freedom by accepting the necessary
restraints in time of crisis.” Dur-
ing wartime they have accepted
voluntary censorship, he said.

At a Subcommittee hearing last
month Moss reported that mem-
bers of the press were asked what
controls would be accepted by
their profession. “There was unan-
imous agreement that all-out war
requires all-out censorship. And
there was complete support for a
clear set of guidelines on infor-
mation control which the press
would accept in time of danger
such as the Cuban crisis. The
problem of the continuing inter-
national tension was_ rejected,
however, as an excuse for restric-

 

Moss Speaks On Freedom Of Press

tion on full access to government
information.”

The press has demanded guide-
lines, Moss said, “we will insist that
the press and the public be taken
into the government confidence and
be allowed to look at and debate
these plans.”

Moss concluded by saying that
when “the executive branch wants
to withhold and restrict information
it will be done. But when the pub-
lic is alerted it is possible to chip
away at government information
restriction.

“Success lies with the people and
the press. Apathy on the part of the
press has been one of our greatest
problems. There needs to be far
more alertness.”

ample is the open chapter on econ-

of of a typical 19th century essay
on the dismal science advocating
abundance, but which turns into

a witty expostulation to give up
material desire.

Dr. Anderson achieved a rare
blend of the scholar and the dilet-
tante in his lecture which could
easily have erred on the side of
dryness. He was most effective in
discovering Thoreau’s humorous side
for the audience. In trying to pen-
etrate to the essential crux of
Thoreau’s thought, however, he
himself finally resorted to a kind of
mystical imagery, which made ex-
cellent listening but left the listner
essentially where he started—with
Walden Pond itself. Which is not a
bad place to left at all.

Wind”). This level can appreciate
what they call good acting—Gregory
Peck, Paul Newman, and Kirk
Douglas. This level can appreciate
mature subjects, as illustrated in
“The Children’s Hour,” “The Mark,”
“Days of Wine and Roses,” and “The
Hustler.”

They also appreciate the unusual,
the different—“Manchurian Candi-
date” is a good example . And they
begin to appreciate the “La Dolce
Vita” and “Black Orpheus” type
films. This level of enjoyment is a
good one, admittedly, but it. still
lacks critical evolution. The people
on this level remain somewhat linked
to the man in the street, for the
question they ask is still, “Did I
like it?” They are easily impressed
by one aspect or part of a film—the
acting, the theme, the ending—and
forget to judge the film for its over-
all value.

The next level is where I place
myself. We look for what is good
and bad in a movie. We watch closely
from beginning to end, evaluating
each scene as it comes before us.

and what is bad. We try to make
our taste conform to our knowledge.
We love “L’Aventura,” “Hiroshima,
Mon Amour,” “Jules and Jim,” and
“Lolita.” We know why we do. But
we are caught in a certain dilemma.
We also like “The Hustler,” and “To
Kill a Mockingbird,” and “Inherit

the Wind.” But we try not to be-
cause we know they are not great
films. Yet emotionally we are most
imperfect and cannot help ourselves.
All we can do is say, “I like it even
though it wasn’t very good,” and try
to evaluate seriously, exactly what is
good and what is bad in the film.
(Which is why I attacked Gregory
Peck in “Mockingbird.” I liked the
film very much, but knew there were
bad things in it. In my frustration,
I became negative.)

There is one more level. This level
is composed of those super-intellec-

and like only one. They are void of

SWMSFC Has Profitable Year;

Concert Will Be Annual Affair

As the current school year draws
to a close, the Student War Memor-
ial Scholarship Fund Committee has
completed one of its most successful
years since its founding. Past pres-
ident Frank Young and next year’s
president Randy Wootton were
pleased at the success of the cur-
rent fund raising campaigns.

Throughout the school year,
SWMSFC has promoted various sales
from which all profits enter the fund
which helps support a worthy stu-
dent while he attends W&L.

This year SWMSFC, as in the past,
has had control of the refreshment
sales at all University dances and
concerts. Before Christmas the com-
mittee conducted the sale of Christ-
mas Cards to students.

In the fall, SWMSFC was in charge

 

of the sale of class rings. From this
sale, the student committee profited
over $200. |
Annual Concert

The public concert, which featured |
the famous concert guitarist Charlie
Bird, was held for the first time this
year. From this concert $425 was
added to the treasury of the scholar-
ship fund. SWMSFC plans to con-
tinue to hold such concerts in the
future. The concert will be held
during an off week-end, and feature
famous jazz, or folk singing groups.

The sale of graduation invitations,
and the rental of caps and gowns
to seniors also conducted by mem-
bers of SWMSFC. This year a new
feature has been added to the rental
of graduation costumes. A_ senior

Publicity Chairman

Delegation chairmen will also lead
pre-convention campaigning for the
several Republican possibilities for
the nomination. The chairmen must
prepare floats to represent their
states in the parade before the con-
vention.

Big Three States

The most important positions
among the state deputations are New
York, Pennsylvania, and California,
all of which control huge blocs of
convention votes; and Arizona, Mich-
igan, and Pennsylvania, which will
nominate leading contenders for the
nomination. Since New York also
has a contender for the nomination,
the New York Chairmanship will
be doubly important.

State chairmen, said Partington,
should be residents of the states they
represent, although this is not es-
sential. They must be rising juniors,
rising seniors, or law students.

In previous Mock Convention
preparation, chairmen of the state
delegations have not been selected
until the Christmas before the con-
vention. The purpose of selecting
them now, said Partington, is to al-
low them the summer months to
lay a foundation in their states.

Summer Preparation

This foundation work will include
personal contact with their local
and state Republican leaders in or-
der to assess the amount of support
for the various candidates. It will
also entail fund-raising to support
Convention expenses. Most of the
funds which are solicited during the
summer will go for floats and simi-
lar campaign expenses.

Those chosen to be state chairmen
will be notified by mail within one
week of the close of school. A Con-
vention Brochure is being prepared
to aid them in publicizing the con-
vention over the summer, and will
reach them late in June.

Partington asked that applications
be sent to the Chairman of the Mock
Convention, Box 617, Lexington.

Letters should include the follow-
ing information about the applicant:
activities in school, resident state,

state for which the writer would
like to apply, political contacts in
that state, and summer address.

Partington requested that letters be
as concise as possible.

There will be a Chemistry Sem-
inar in Howe 401 this Friday at
5:00 p.m. The discussion will fea-
ture James Reynolds and John
Roper, who will speak on “The

An Opportunity To Appreciate

The selection of the state

Mock Convention is a matter for the entire student body to
take note of. The success or failure of the 1964 Convention
hinges directly on those who fill these offices. We trust that
students who are the least bit interested will apply.
Applications are to be considered on the basis of interest,
available time, and ability to organize and get along with others.
Convention Chairman Phil Sharp stated that knowledge about

politics is not a requisite.

If it is to be successful, the Convention will demand the
full participation of the student body. Part of the responsibility
of state chairmen, it should be noted, is to enlist this participa-
tion and see that each student has his share of the work.

Traditionally, the Mock Convention is student-run and

student-financed. Although it is
sive of the college conventions,

the most authentic. Since its beginning in 1908, it has predicted
correctly eight of the nominees for the party out of office,
and was wrong in only four cases. The accuracy of these pre-
dictions has depended primarily on the state chairmen.

We are particularly grateful to the Administration for
providing us with this valuable opportunity. We students

should feel extremely obligated

heres to its original purpose, i.e., to give us as future citizens
the chance to see and experience the nation’s politics at work.

If we fail to take such an opportunity seriously, we may
be hurting the student bodies that succeed us. For it is only
through the generosity of the Administration that we continue

to have the Convention. If we

Conflicts Over Basic Rights
Evokes Remarks On Dewey

By PETE ALFORD

We all know about the right of
ownership of private property, but
are we as familiar as we should be
with the responsibilities of owner-
ship which accompany that right?

“We reserve the right to refuse
service to anyone,” states many a
sign in this country, but is that an
inalienable right?

“Why of course! A business es-
tablishment is private property and
the individual’s property is protect-
ed by the Constitution.”

“Yes, but what about the right of
every individual in this country?
What does the Constitution say about
that?”

“It protects them. That's why we
have the right to refuse service to
anyone. Don’t you see? I believe
in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights,
and the traditions of our country as
much as the next guy.”

These and related issues are being
tested in the United States and will
continue to be tested. It will prob-
ably be the paramount internal is-
sue facing our country in the next
decade. Where do you stand?

Tradition vs. Change

Philosopher John Dewey in his
work Liberalism and _ Intelligence
puts forth some ideas which are
poignantly applicable to situations
today. He contends that we live in
a world of constant change and that
this state of flux generates problems.
Our institutions, customs, and tra-
ditions of the past are in constant
conflict with new forces and stresses.

Dewey suggests that we need to

struggle for intellectual freedom.

the Virginia State Police Headquart-
ers in Richmond, a small church in
Rockbridge County and the Cerebral
Palsy Center in Richmond. His first
fresco was done in 1952 in the base-
ment of Washington and Lee’s Mc-
Cormick Library. It deals with man’s

 

adjust the old with the new. He
sees the whole of man’s history as
repetitious human adaption on a col-
lective basis to the demand of new
situations.

To a large extent man has solved
the basic problems of providing food
and shelter for himself, but there
remains the whole range of social
problems—or how to live together.

End to Mankind Seen

Dewey, who wrote this work in
1935, sees an end of mankind unless
social problems can be solved. He|
suggests that we as human beings|
must modify old habits, customs, and |
traditions to meet new situations,
remembering to avoid the danger of
foisting the old on the new, and,
just as important, not allowing the
new to erupt destructively and de-
stroy all that is good in the old.

Dewey maintains that intellegence
will effect a bridge between old tra-
ditions and new forces. It is a choice,
then, between force or intellegence,
and Dewey feels that if people are
convinced that force is the only way,
they will be cut off from the use
of intelligence. He states that the
problem of conflict is not an insur-
mountable obstacle to rational solu-
tions of social problems.

Discussion of Conflict

In his philosophy he suggests that
with the use of intellegence we can
discuss, appraise and _ adjudicate
problems which occur from con-
flicts of interest and devise solutions
in the light of greater social pur-
poses.

A Note From Friday Edition

Dear Sirs:

There have been two unfortunate
misunderstandings in recent weeks
which need to be clarified before
the school year ends. One of these
was included in an editorial which
endorsed Lamar Lamb’s proposal to
modify the permanent expulsion
penalty in our Honor System. It
was printed, at that time, that the
permanent expulsion penalty was
instituted only thirty years ago.

The following week, this statement |

was modified to read: “According to
Lamb, penalties other than the pres-
ent one were invoked as late as 1936;
...he assures us that there were
convicted honor violators who re-
ceived less than the present penalty.”
The statement in the first editorial
was false, and the statement in the
second one appears to be a moot
point among EC members. In other
words, it depends on how you in-
terpret the past EC minutes. It is
this matter of interpretation which
led to the confusion about this point.
Whatever the case may be, however,
I do not think it is relevant to the
spirit of Lamar Lamb’s proposal.

The second misunderstanding has

ham?

no relation to the one just men-
tioned. In last Friday’s paper we
mentioned that one individual de-
termined W&L’s stand on NSA
affiliation. This was our understand-
ing at the time. It has been pointed
out, though, that the EC did vote
unanimously on this measure. The
point of what was said in our reply
to Mr. Gilmore should remain ob-
vious nevertheless.

DREW BAUR

Student Wants To End
Foreign Exchange Program

Dear Sir:

I would like to recommend to the
faculty and student body that the
foreign exchange program as it is
at this school be dropped.

There are many individuals that
have received a great deal of bene-
fit from the exchange program this
year, but they are few. More im-
portant, the foreign students them-
selves have, by their own admission,
received nothing but a negative im-
pression of America and of Wash-
ington and Lee during their stay
here. This need not be; the exchange
program works well in the majority
of schools across the country.

The failure of the program this
year is due to W&L itself. With-
out making value judgments about
our fraternity system, we can still
see that it prevents foreign stu-
dents from making friends. By the
second week here, most students
know the people that will be their
close friends for the next four
years; and to introduce a person
into their world as a sophomore,
especially one that is foreign to
their particular folkways, will have
predictable results. I am as guilty
of this as anyone else.

Two solutions present themselves:
either change the school or drop the
program. The first is hopeless; and
the second, though unfortunate, is
necessary if we are to avoid a tre-
mendous waste of money, hope, and
time that occurred this year from
happening again.

Dr. Junkin’s most recent fresco is
in the Children’s Chapel of Lex-
ington’s R. E. Lee Memorial Episco-
pal Church of which he is a mem-
ber. He began work on the design
and preliminary sketches of the new
fresco during the first semester of
the current academic year and com-
pleted the 19-panel mural a little
less than a month ago.

The Episcopal church fresco—

from the Old Testament and the

A Local Master Of Fresco- Painting
Applies Skills Of Artist And Plasterer

Before the actual plastering was
done in the Children’s Chapel, Dr.
Junkin drew the full freseo on
brown paper mounted on the wall
in his duPont Hall Studio on the
Washington and Lee campus. He in-
cluded the finest detail and coloring
in his preliminary painting.

Scaffold building, the hauling of
plaster, marble sand and water plus
the necessary tools followed for the
three months after the Washington
and Lee professor finished the first
drawing. Prof. Junkin turned to the
actual fresco painting in mid-Feb-
ruary, and, then, did it only in his
spare time.

Alter in Future Plans

In the way of finishing touches
for the tiny chapel, Dr. Junkin plans
to make a small altar, hang drapes
and refinish the pews in the room.
He already has rigged special light-

ing to accent the fresco.

A native of Chunju, Korea, where
his parents were missionaries, Dr.
Junkin first beeame interested in
fresco painting in the early 1950's.
Washington and Lee awarded him
a Glenn grant-in-aid in 1952 for
a summer’s study of the fresco pro-
cess and its history in Mexico. His
1952 visit resulted in the frescos in
the University library, in the hos-
pital in Lexington and in the State
Police building. Dr. Junkin and his
family returned to Mexico again in
the summer of 1950 so he could study
fresco painting further.

Summer Trip to Greece
This summer, he plans to journey
to Greece to study Byzantine frescos

in some of the Greek Orthodox
chruches.
Dr. Junkin, a 1927 graduate of

Washington and Lee, established the
University’s fine arts department
when he returned to Lexington in
1949. He came back to Alma Mater

Discussion of integration is becom-
ing an increasingly popular topic
among certain ele-
ments on_ the
Washington and
Lee campus. The
theme of discus-
sion centers on the
question of inte-
gration of W&L
itself, and whether
this is morally
right or wrong,
Christian or non-
Christian. But this
is not the real is-
sue. The real issue is whether we, as
American citizens, have the right to
choose ‘the type of people with whom
we wish to associate.

I do not deny anyone an educa-
tion because of his race, color or
creed. There are many educational
institutions in our country with bi-
racial student bodies, as well as
those that are all-Negre or all-
white. I feel that every qualified

he is congenial.
Differences Stressed

ings, but he made us different in
color, personality, and ability. If
he had meant for us to all be alike,
he would have made us so; but for-
tunately the earth is not populated
with stereotypes. It is my observa-
tion that people separate according
to their differences. It is a natural
thing.

People with different ideas and de-
sires would rather associate with
those similarly oriented. It is the
same with people of different races.
Most of them would rather be
with their own kind. The important
thing is that people have a right
to choose, and it is unfair to force
them into one group when they
would rather be in another.

Intergration at W&L

It is in this light that I view the
question of integration at W&L. I
am not questioning whether inte-
gration is right or inevitable. I do
know that at the present time, peo-
ple have a right to choose the envir-
onment and the type of students with
which they wish to study. Wash-
ington and Lee is a private institu-
tion and as such it has a right to
choose the people who will make
up its student body. When students

young person should be offered the! &

 

with the type of people with whom |

The Creator made us human be-| ,

| is a university which has chosen to

educate an all-white student body.
A student who feels more congenial
with Negroes should not come to
W&L, but rather attend an inte-
grated school, or try to get in an
all-Negro school. But I contend that
all-Negro schools as well as all-
White schools such as W&L, have
a right to choose their student bodies.

If a student realizes after coming
to W&L that he would be happier in
an integrated school, it is not his
place to ask the school to change
for him; it is his place to do the
changing.

 

Freedom Of Association Stands
As Reason For Segregation Here

This is not a monetary question.
Most certainly Washington and Lee
loses contributions to its endowment
because some individuals or organ-
izations choose to donate to an in-
tegrated school. But on the other
hand it gains from others who wish
to contribute to a segregated school.
This is not a question of whether
we deny Negroes a right to an edu-
cation. Surely we do not. The ques-
tion is one of right of association
and those who would forbid us this
right, forbid at the same time one
of the basic rights of freedom of
the American people.

Several weeks ago I wrote a col-
umn in which I discussed differences
in attitudes held
toward Negro
speakers (meant
to refer to all
Negro academi-
cians and_intel-
' lects) and toward
_ Negro entertain-
; ers. That column
was provoked by
the quality of
some of what was
foisted as “en-
tertainment” here
during Springs Weekend and was not
meant to refer to any particular
existing situation.

Since the publication of that col-
umn, I have learned that James
Baldwin, the noted Negro writer,
had been asked to speak on this
campus under the sponsorship of the
English Department and the Liberty
Hall Society. Though this action
was taken some months ago, I
learned of it only after my column
had been printed.

   

Kinsey

The Faculty Lecture Committee,
with two members of the student
body present, voted unanimously
to ask Mr. Baldwin to speak. The
Committee action is standard pro-
cedure, as the Committee has to
approve the disbursement of funds
for the payment of speakers. The
two students present were the
president of the student body at
the time (he meets with the Com-
mittee on important matters) and

 

the president of the Liberty Hall
Society.

Distinguished Negro Writer
Invited to Speak on Campus

Upon approval of the request for
funds with which to pay Mr. Bald-
win, a letter was sent to him and
he was asked to speak. A short
time later, Dr. Duvall, head of the
English Department received a letter
from Baldwin’s agent, stating that
Baldwin was in Europe at the time
and that he was booked for a serie:
of speaking engagements on_ the
West Coast as soon as he got back
The agent went on to say _ tha’
Baldwin had plans to begin work 01
a play as soon as he arrived bach
in New York, and that it would br
a good while before he would b
free to speak anywhere. Baldwit
he said, already had to decline |
good number of offers to speak else
where. The agent also stated tha
Baldwin was seeking a little res
after his tiring round of travel ani
speeches of the last few months.

The fact that is significant and
praiseworthy is that Baldwin was
asked to speak here because he
is a distinguished Negro write:
(note light face), and because it
was felt that he had something tq
offer to this student body. These
two criterion—distinetion in one’:
field and something worthwhile t
offer—properly applied, should b«
the basis of judging everyone whx«
appears on this campus, regard.
less of whether what he is offering
is intellectual enlightenment o
entertainment, regardless of races
or creed.

In Final Game

By DOUG MORRISON

The lacrosse team closed out its
season on Saturday with a 13-5
loss in a hard fought game against
the nationally ranked Cavaliers of
Virginia. The spectators at Char-
lottesville saw a closely contested
game for the first period and a half
until Virginia captain Landon Huff
scored his only goal of the day to
help put the Cavaliers out of reach.
The second and third periods were
the decisive ones for Virginia with
four goals being scored in each.

Initial Score

The first score of the day came
with less than a minute gone in the
first period on a goal by Virginia
attackman Jack Davies. After that
the game settled into an even battle
between the two teams, until midway

quick goals. The W&L team then An exciting moment in one of the General’s lacrosse games this year.

Chapel To

Reopen

Early This August

The re-opening of Washington and Lee University’s his-
toric Lee Chapel—under restoration since last June—has been
set for early August, university officials said today.

Plans at the time of the announcement of the $370,000
restoration called for the nearly 100-year-old Chapel to be
ready in time for Washington and Lee’s commencement ex-

ercises on June 7. However, rep-*——————

resentatives of the John P. Petty-
john Company of Lynchburg, gen-
eral contractor for the job have in-
dicated they cannot have their work
crews out of the Chapel before July
Le

D. E. Brady, superintendent of
buildings and grounds at Washing-
ton and Lee, said it would take an-
other month after the contractor
completes his work to put the fin-
ishing touches on the structure that
was designed by General Robert E.
Lee and built in 1867.

No one special problem has
slowed the structure's restoration,
rather the care taken in the pres-
ervation work has altered the
schedule outlined in original plan-
ning, Brady said.

The complete restoration of Lee
Chapel, where General Lee is buried,
was started last June after the Ford
Motor Company Fund of Dearborn,
Mich., gave Washington and Lee the
$370,000 for the undertaking. The
funds were given to the university
to “help preserve one of the South’s
most prized landmarks.”

Although an exact date has not
been selected for the Chapel re-
opening, university officials said the
building will be open before August
10. Formal re-dedication ceremonies
will be held in the early Fall after
Washington and Lee’s 215th aca-
demic year gets underway.

Pettyjohn crews currently are
resetting door frames and other
millwork that were removed when
the restoration was first started.
Painting, sanding of the oroginal
floors and the installation of elec-
trical equipment also are under-
way now.

Last week, workers turned to
pouring concrete walks, grading and
cleaning up around the exterior of
the structure. Construction officials
hope to remove a wooden fence that
has surrounded the project for more
than 10 months before the univer-
sity’s commencement exercises on
June 6 and 7.

The installation of steel beams
in the floor and roof of the Chapel
plus concrete sub-flooring for the
auditorium was completed more than
two months ago. At one point in the
restoration project, the floor and
roof of the Chapel were completely
removed. Each piece of the flooring
and the slate from the roof were
marked when they were removed in
order to replace them in their origi-
nal locations.

Although emphasis in the Chapel
project is on restoration, certain ex-
tensive improvements have been
made to assure the future preserva-
tion of the building and its valuable
contents.

A fire alarm system has been in-
stalled along with safety devices
to detect leaks and faulty equip-
ment operation. The Chapel will
be completely air-conditioned to
aid in preserving the million-dol-
lar art collections that hangs there
and the hundreds of Lee memora-
bilia that again will be displayed
in the Chapel’s first floor museum

A special underground room was
added in front of the building to
house sizeable heating, air-condi-
tioning and electrical units. The
room will not be visible to visitors.

Considerable remodeling has been
done in the Chapel’s museum to pro-
vide for better display of the histori-
cal holdings relating to Lee and the

 

period of the 1860’s. The office used
by General Lee when he was pres-
ident of Washington College (now
Washington
1870 has been restored
September 1870. Furniture
is being refurbished.

Young GOP’s
End Active Year

By GEORGE PRIGGEN

In March, seven Washington and

Lee Young Republicans went down
to Williamsburg for the Young Re-
publican Regional Convention, en-
compassing delegates from a four-
state (Washington, D.C.) area.

The W&L delegation spent three
memorable days enjoying the sights
of Williamsburg, and participating in

the work of the Regional Conven- |

tion. The delegation voted as a unit,
in order to give greater strength to
the W&L position. The W&L delega-
tion was especially successful in ef-
fecting a “watering-down” of sev-
eral “civil rights” proposals in the
YR Regional platform.

At the convention John Lundy of
W&L was elected 1st Vice-President
of the Virginia State YR Federation.
The Convention next year will be
something for all W&L Young Re-
publicans to look forward to.

Officers of the Young Republican
Club of W&L were elected at the
end of April: President, Jerry Caden;

Vice-Presidents, Gavin Garrett and’!

George Priggen; Corresponding Sec-
retary, Benton Bolton; Recording
Secretary, Charles Owen; Treasur-
er, Alex Rasin; Parliamentarian,
John Lundy; and Advisors, Craig
Distelhorst and Robert Wheelock.

 

Finals Concert Successful
With Top Local Talent

The Finals Concert this year was
an unqualified success, thanks main-
ly to a newly discovered local talent.

A student group called the Way-
siders stole the show on Tuesday
night with a half hour of folk-
song entertainment that shook Dore-
mus Gymnasium with applause. This
group consists of two upcoming jun-
iors, Dave Trussell of Towson, Md.,
and Jim Ledbetter of San Francisco,
Cal.

Joining the Waysiders Tuesday
night was the Rooftop Singers, a
nationally famous folksinging trio.
They gained a strong applause from

Debate Team Completes
Most Successful Season

The Washington and Lee debate
team ended the 1962-63 school year
with “more tournaments, more vic-
tories, and more participants” than
ever before, says Director of Foren-
sics William W. Chaffin.

For the third straight year, Bill
Noell and Al Eckes were the big-
gest names in Virginia debate com-
petition. This year W&L also put
some ne wnames in the field—two
freshmen whom Chaffin calls the
best prospects since Noell andEckes
arrived: Mike Hayslip and Ed Fitz-
gerald.

W&L closed out the debate season
with a trip to the national cham-
pionships at West Point, New York,
and, although they failed to place
among the top teams, earned a vic-
tory over Dartmouth, which won
the national title.

The first major tournament of last
fall was the Old Dominion Tour-
nament in which W&L placed first
in the two-man division. Noell won
the Persuasive Speaking contest,
while Eckes finished third in After
Dinner Speaking.

October 29: the W&L team appears

 

 

LEE CHAPEL = . to reopen in August.

 

on Norfolk television for an exhi-
bition match, winning the debate.

Host Tournament
November 16: Washington and Lee
hosts the regional Tau Kappa Alpha
Debate Tournament. Bill Boardman,
captain of the W&L team, is presi-
dent of the regional TKA organiza-
tion. Although Noell and Eckes have

won the TKA championship as fresh-| ,

men and sophomores, they do not
enter as juniors, due to their posi-
tions as hosts.

Eckes and Norton Win

December 1: Eckes and Ed Nor-
ton win first place in the Pittsburgh
Cross Examination Tournament, go-
ing undefeated. By placing first in
number of speakers, Eckes establish-
es himself as one of the top debaters
in the country.

December 8: Noel land Norton
fail to place in the Dixie Classic
Tournament at Wake Forest, but
Noell wins awards of excellence in
debate and in  extemporaneous
speaking.

March 10: Noell and Eckes compile
a 4-2 record in Georgetown’s Cher-
ry Blossom Invitational.

Qualify

March 16: Noell and Eckes quali-
fy for the national championships by
earning a 12-4 record in preliminary
rounds at King’s College in Pennsyl-
vania. After losing their first four
rounds in the meet, they snap back
with a 12-decision winning streak.

April 13: Eckes and Ed Fitzgerald
win the Old Dominion Debate Tour-
nament with an undefeated slate.
Eckes wins first place in speaker
points, and Fitzgerald places fourth.
Mike Hayslip, debateing with Jack
Eure, places second in _ speaker
points. Fitzgerald and Hayslip, both
freshmen, prove themselves out-
standing prospects.

Graduation

From The Past

The following was written in 1947 by Charlie McDowell.
then a student at Washington and Lee. Things are pretty much
the same. Only the date has changed.

A,
Ww

One bright June morning pretty soon now a crowd will
gather at a little college chapel to see a graduation .They will
take seats on the hard straightbacked seats inside the little
building on the rows of folding chairs set up in the sunshine
and maple-shade outside.

Mothers and fathers will meet other mothers and fathers,
and little sisters will be introduced to roommates. A grand-
father will tell a girl from Hollins about the time he sat on the
same hard seats waiting for his own diploma.

Four young wives will sit together talking about new ad-
dresses and the old bridge club. An usher who is just a little
hung over will show an elderly lady who hasn’t missed a gradu-
ation in thirty years to her seat.

As people with cameras edge closer to the sidewalk, a bell
will begin to ring. A long line of boys in black robes and tassled
hats will move down the center walk two-by-two and out of step.
Some will smile, some frown, and some will seem sad.

They will file into the little chapel; there will be coughing
and scraping of feet; and then a man will begin to speak. The
graduating class of 1963 will sit down and listen.

The man will talk about Washington and Lee and a boy in
the third row will look out the windows at the green tree in the
sun and will think about Washington and Lee. He will re-
member the glare of the sun in his eyes as he lay on a big warm
rock in Goshen Pass listening to tumbling water. He will re-
member sitting on the grass in the Spring talking and drinking
a Coke.

He will remember a lecture on Milton and a power lawn
mower droning across the wide expanse of green outside. He
will remember a fraternity room late at night filling with cigar-
ette smoke and argument and friendship.

He will remember a hillside red and gold and amber in the
Fall. He will remember a history book and scrambled eggs at
two in the morning and a truck driver dozing over his french
fries.

He will remember a cold winter night in a car rolling toward
Lexington and a wonderful off-key song. And he will remember
running down the hill from the library at dusk along the slick
cement walks with Spring rain falling in the dark trees.

He will remember . . . Washington and Lee.

Dean Frank J. Gilliam
To Step Down

Although no official announcement has been made, it is
common knowledge that with the end of this school year,
Dean of Admissions Frank J. Gilliam will step down from his
post on the Hill. Dean Gilliam’s resignation closes three de-
cades during which he has been an institution at Washington
and Lee—during which he has become a symbol of the Uni-
versity itself. There are few men on the W&L faculty who can
match him for tenure of service, and fewer still who can match
him for value of contribution, Probably there is nobody else
living who is, to the students and to the alumni, so representa-
tive of Washington and Lee.

It has been nearly 50 years since Frank J. Gilliam entered
W&L as a student. Since 1926 he has been either on the facul-
ty or in the administration of the school. He was W&L’s first
Dean of Students, and its first Dean of Admissions, and until
last year he held both these positions at the same time. During
1963, his last year of official association with W&L, an award
was established in his name by the student body, and the year-
book was dedicated to him. The Editors of the Calyx wrote in
their statement honoring Dean Gilliam: “If the dedication of
this book conveys the idea that Dean Gilliam’s contribution
to the progress of Washington and Lee transcends all verbal
tribute, then our purpose is accomplished.”

WHAT DOES YOUR

OF THE FOREIGN SITUATION?

 

 

 

 

 

 

Friday Edition, Ring-tum Phi
Washington and Lee University
Dear Sir:

Recently Jim Ledbetter suggested
in a letter “that the foreign exchange
program as it is at this school be
dropped.”

He feels this way because the
foreign students receive a negative
impression of America and Wash-
ington and Lee through the program.
He concludes that, since this is a
result of conditions at W&L, either
the school should be changed, which
he feels to be impossible, or the pro-
gram ended.

I think that the program should
not only be continued, but increased,
that is we should try to bring more
foreign students to W&L and we
should also try to set up programs
so more of our students could spend
the junior year abroad.

The success of a foreign exchange
program, like the success of any
human institution, depends upon
people. Schools and programs change
only as the individuals in them
change. Better people make better
institutions.

The present means of feeding and
housing foreign students and the
inadequate chance they have of be-
coming a part of university life con-
tribute to the weakness of the pro-
gram; some of these things are now
undergoing change.

What is most important, however,
is that each individual student who
believes in the worthiness of the ex-
change program take it upon himself
to act as host and, if possible, a
friend to all future foreign students.

Hospitality among the Greeks was
given divine sanction by the gods
of Olympus; it has fallen into disuse
in America.

The problem of hospitality, ex-
istential solitude, apathy, communi-
cation, and friendship are all inter-
connected. Only individuals can
seek to remedy the problems.

JOHN KIRKLEY

Research

In the psychology laboratory at
Washington and Lee University, a
senior performs a delicate brain op-
eration on a white rat, while in an
adjoining room, another student
clocks other white rats in their prog-
ress through a simple maze.

Across town, in the privacy of his
own room, a student sits down with
a stack of seldom-used books from
the recesses of Washington and Lee
library and prepares to search them
for references to French philoso-
pher Pierre Abelard.

Fifty miles away, in the Roanoke
office of the president of a small
metal fabricating plant, another
Washington and Lee student ques-
tions the older man about the way
he operates his business.

In the physics laboratories of the
university's new science building,
several students patiently set up
another attempt to “grow” a pure
single crystal of zine in a high
temperature furnace that they
helped design and build.

Still another student quietly but
thoroughly pores over a collection
of faded letters—most of them a
century old—in ‘the office of a his-
tory professor.

In spite of the diversity of these
activities, each of these students
is working in the same program at
Washington and Lee. Their work is
typical of the activities of some 75
of the university’s students during
the current academic year.

Each is engaged in a_ highly-
specialized area of research, each
is working under the guidance of
a professor who is a trained re-
searcher and each is permitted a
degree of responsibiliy in the pro-
ject that is commensurate with his
training and experience.

All are part of Washington and
Lee’s Robert E. Lee Research Pro-
gram for Undergraduates—now in
its third year of operation. The
program is supported by a 1960 gift
of more than a quarter of a million
dollars from an alumnus, the late Dr.
Gustavus B. Capito of Charleston,
West Va. This fund was later aug-
mented by two gifts from the
Charleston Foundation for Research,
and under the combined support, the
program has grown significantly.

Each student in the program is

either a Robert E. Lee Research
Assistant or a Robert E. Lee Re-
search Scholar. Both terms mean
distinction on the Washington and
Lee campus.

In many instances, the student’s
project involves research interests

 

 

University Christian Association
Logs Another Successful Year

Everyone on campus is familiar
with the organization known as the
University Christian Association, but
how many outside of the immediate
active membership know about its
functions, purposes, and organiza-
tion? It would not be overly pre-
sumptious to say not many.

The purpose of the UCA is to
stimulate intellectual understanding
of Christianity and to act for the
benefit of the community. Its mem-
bership includes (and this will be a
surprise to most) everyone enrolled
at Washington and Lee, inclusive
of all faiths. There are, however,
only around forty to fifty people who
actively work for the UCA, which
is financed by the University.

The association consists of four
committees, each of which is headed
by a committee chairman. The com-
mittees are: the Community Service
Committee, the Mountain Missions
Commititee, the Boys Club Commit-
tee, and the Seminars in Religion
Committee. These groups are co-
ordinated by the UCA Executive
Committee consisting of the Presi-
dent, two Vice-Presidents, a Secre-
tary, Treasurer, and the four com-
mittee chairmen. The UCA also
has a faculty advisor, who currently
is Dr. Louis W. Hodges.

Community Service

The Community Service Committee
has a wide and varied range of
functions. It works in close coopera-
tion with the Lexington Welfare De-
partment ito provide relief for the
poor of Rockbridge County. Every
third Wednesday of each month,
members of this committee distribute
surplus food to people who present
slips issued by the Welfare Depart-
ment. The food is provided by the
Federal Government.

The Community Service Commit-
tee also collects needed clothing,
turns it over to the Welfare Depart-
ment, and does incidental work for
this bureau of the city government.
Last winter, the committee helped to
plan the Christmas candlelight serv-

Program

of the supervising faculty member,
in which case the student serves as
a research assistant or apprentice,
carrying out assignments at the di-
rection of his professor. In other
projects, the research may have been
conceived by the student himself,
then planned and executed under the
supervision of a professor interested
in helping the undergraduate.

In virtually every case, the work
of the students and their level of
involvement is comparable with that
normally undertaken by the gradu-
ate level in pursuit of advanced de-
grees. The close relationships be-
tween students and professors is
similar to that encountered at the
Ph.D. level in graduate school, uni-
versity officials note.

Established in the second semes-
ter of the 1960-61 session, the Rob-
ert E. Lee Research Program first
involved only 25 students in a
handful of projects. By 1961-62, 57
students were active in 49 projects.
Participation has increased even
more this academic year with 72
students working in 55 projects
under 34 professors who represent
17 academic areas.

 

Although a large number of pro-
jects concern the natural sciences,
the humanities and social sciences
are well-represented in the pro-
gram, and a university-wide balance
is achieved in application of the
program’s funds.

Represented in the 1962-63 pro-
jects are such diverse fields as
accounting, music, sociology, lin-
guistics, economics, public speak-
ing, military science, commerce,
modern foreign languages, English,
philosophy, history and law, as well
as the sciences—biology, chemistry,
geology, physics and psychology.

Dr. W. W. Pusey, UI, Dean of
the College and the man who di-
rects the overall program, expects
student and faculty interest in re-
search to increase still further,
probably to a point where the
limited funds available for the
program will place student appli-
eants in a highly competitive situa-
tion.

The overall purpose of the pro-
gram is to present undergraduates
with an opportunity to work closely
with professors in meaningful re-
search projects that will acquaint the
students with the tools, techniques
and odology of scholarly and scien-
tific investigation.

A principal benefit of the pro-
gram is the stimulus given to the
intellectual curiosity of the students.
Even for students who do not in-

 

ice at R. E. Lee Memorial Church
and tendered its services in Dr.
Colvin’s plan for the re-settlement
of a Cuban refugee family in Lex-
ington.

One of the more outstanding
works of the Community Service
Committee was to redecorate the
UCA reading room—the room just
to the right of the front door of the
Student Union. This year, members
of the committee re-painted this
room; furnished it with a new carpet,
sofa, two easy chairs, several pic-
tures, and desks; and provided it
with a special rack containing book-
lets on pertinent theological topics.
These booklets are on sale at 50c
apiece. One third of the original
stock has already been sold.

Student Sermons

The Mountain Missions Commit-
tee serves an educational purpose.
It’s members go to various churches
in Rockbridge County where they
teach Sunday school, deliver ser-
mons, and help conduct the respec-
tives services. There are five
churches and missions in the Moun-
tain Missions Committee’s program:
the Clark Mountain Mission, McEl-
wee Chapel, the Broad Creek Pres-
byterian Church, the House Moun-
tain Mission, and the Poplar Hill
Presbyterian Church.

Last Christmas, the committee
gave a party for the children of
Lexington. Presents for the occasion
were given by the Lexington Presby-
tery.

Recreation for Boys

The Boys Club Committee provides
recreation and guidance for many of
the city’s boys. This committee or-
ganizes and referees games such as
football, baseball, and basketball for
the groups of boys in its care. Such
groups are often taken to Doremus
gymnasium where they may have
the opportunity to swim in the gym’s
pool.

The Boys Club Committee has also
conducted what is known as the
Big Brother Program. In this pro-

gram, each participating commit-
teeman is assigned to a delinquent
young person and serves as _ his
counselor and helper.

Theological Discussions

Finally, there is the Seminars in
Religion Committee, the branch
which concentrates on the theologi-
cal and intellectual education of the
active members of UCA and of the
entire school, regarding the guest
speaker program. This committee
conducts seminars between W&L
and Sweet Briar, Randolph-Macon,
and Hollins respectively. The sub-
jects for discussion range from in-
tegration to the life of the academic
community, “practically anything
you can think of” according to Rod
Cockshutt, next year’s President of
UCA.

The Seminars in Religion Commit-
tee further provides the school with
guest speakers, such as O. Hobart
Mowrer of the University of Illi-
nois who spoke on guilt therapy for
the mentally ill by group discussion
last November. In this particular
case, the UCA combined with the
Psychology department to make Dr.
Mowrer’s talks possible.

New Officers Chosen

The association has recently held
elections and will be ready to begin
its operations again next September
when school opens. Working under
Cockshutt will be Ken Lane, the
Vice-President for Discussions;
Shannon Jung, the Vice-President
for Seminars; and Malcolm Morris,
Secretary.

In summary, we see how the Uni-
versity Christian Association plays
an extremely valuable role in com-
munity and university life. It at once
helps provide for some of the physi-
cal, spiritual, and recreational need
of the Lexington area and stimulates
the intellectual growth of its own
participants. It is certainly a worth-
while and rewarding activity for any
student wishing to participate, which
is not very difficult to do since we
are all member of the UCA anyway!

 

Keynotes Variety

tend to go on to graduate school,
participation in the program is re-
warding and challenging.

No Robert E. Lee Research Pro-
gram participants receive academ-
ic credit for their work nor do
they feel that this kind of program
should involve grades and credit.
R. Meade Christian, Jr., of Rich-
mond, Washington and Lee’s 1963
valedictorian who assists biology
professor Dr. L .R. Emmons in a
project in cytogenetics, feels the
Lee program offers undergradu-
ate a unique relationship with
professors.

“I think it is good for students
to work with their professors and
not be concerned with getting an ‘A’
or ‘B’ result,” Christian said. “It’s
a real change of pace for me to
work with Dr. Emmons, share his
excitement and his enthusiasms—
and his disappointments. This pro-
gram encourages students to do
things on their own, and for me,
it has been excellent technical train-
ing for my future work in medical
school.”

The program, in addition to the
research advantages, offers campus
part-time employment for partici-
pants, Each student agrees to de-
vote a given number of hours to
his work during a semester, and
he is compensated at an hourly
rate based on his experience.

Some of the students achieve al-
most total involvement in their re-
search. William M. Durrett, an At-
lanta senior, has acquired a surgeon’s
skill in his works with Dr. Leonard
E. Jarrard’s white rats—used by the
professor in a number of psychology
studies. Durrett even keeps a sleep-
ing bag in his laboratory in duPont
Hall so he can work late and get an
early start. He is so interested in
the experiments that he hopes to
return next year as a special stu-
dent to continue his assistance to
Dr. Jarrard.

“You learn to be patient and work
hard without expecting dramatic re-
sults at every turn,” says Robert
M. Auburn, a senior pre-medical
student from Falls Church, Va. who

Lane and Fauber Top Athletes

A football quarterback and a
basketball forward, both captains
of their respective teams this year,
walked off with top honors Wednes-
day at Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s annual all-sports barbecue and
awards presentation.

Charles Lane, Hopkinsville, Minn.,
one of the tri-captains for the 1962
football Generals, and Roger Fauber,
Lynchburg, the cage captain this
year, presented with trophies for
valuable contributions and _ sports-
manship. Both are seniors.

Lane

W&L’s Most Valuable Athlete
Award went to Lane, a four-year
football and baseball veteran. He
captained the baseball team this
Spring and has won letters in both
sports each of his four years.

Fauber

Fauber, also a four-year intercol-
legiate sports veteran, copped the
Wink Glasgow Spirit and Sports-
manship Award and the Basketball
Coaches Trophy. The Glasgow
Award is given annually to the sen-
ior who has best displayed Wash-
ington and Lee spirit and sportsman-
ship over his four-year college ca-
reer.

Payne

Robert Payne, Louisville, Ky., one
of the football tri-captains last Fall,
was the other senior to win two
awards. The Ty Rauber Homecoming

Football Award for the top player | x

in the 1962 homecoming game and
the Dan Ray Justice Football Award
for the “roughest and toughest”
player of the year went to Payne,
who has played football for four
years.

Ten other seniors were presented
awards at the barbecue that was held
at the Rockbridge County camp of
head football coach Lee McLaughlin.
W&L monograms went to 167 ath-
letes in 12 intercollegiate sports and
cheerleading while 126 others, mostly
freshmen, received numerals.

Athletic Director E. P. “Cy”
Twombly reported that 380 different
Washington and Lee students par-

 

  

Dr. Louis Hodges, professor of re-
ligion, recognized for his invaluable
contributions to this campus.

The correct appearance of both ‘on and off” campus is so very im-

portant throughout the school year . . .

Our long experience with W&L men enables us to soundly advise

You, as a student of W&L, hold the priviledge of an open charge ac-
count, either billed direct to you or to your home, or both, whatever

other services.

We cordially invite your correspondence on particular apparel prob-
lems that you may have. You may be assured of our personal and

prompt attention to each and every inquiry made, and in addition,

we will gladly forward our catalogue to you on request.
